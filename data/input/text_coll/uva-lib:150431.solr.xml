Court held for Virginia the 20th of May 1622 Present Right Honoble: Lo: Cauendish1 1 The handwriting of most of the first two hundred and fifty pages of this volume is the same as that of the latter part of the first volume. It has there been referred to as that of the fourth copyist. Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Ro: Smith. mr Iadwin. Sr Iohn Dãuers. mr Binge. mr Kingstone. Sr Iohn Brooke. mr Wilmer. mr Ditchfeild.

Mr Deputy acquainted the Courte that himselfe and some others entreated by the former Court had bin at Sr Thomas Smiths before the appointed Referrees concerninge Capt Martins buissines, and havinge vnderstood the matter of his charge, wch was that the Virginia Company denied him the fruition of those priuiledges, that were formerly graunted vnto him, aswell in his Patent of the Maistershippe of the Ordinance in Virginia as also in his other Patent of his private Plantation; They desired to receaue his said Charge in writinge accordinge to the direc?on of the last Court, wherevnto a speedie Aunsweare should be returned with all conveniency: Wherevpon it pleased the said Co?ittee to require Capt: Martin to sett downe his greevances in writinge by waye of Peti?on vnto them, wch they by letter would reco?end to the Virginia Company and expect their Answeare: Accordingly wherevnto it was nowe co?ended by the Referrees, wch he presented in Court, and beinge read and taken into considera?on, and likewise the peti?on exhibited by Capt Martin to his Matie wch contayned many scandalous suggestions, aswell against the whole Company, as some speciall Members thereof: After delib- era?on had therevpon, it was at length aduised and thought fitt, that in their Answr vnto the said Peti?on there should be a double addresse made (vizt) the one vnto his Matie, aswell for clearinge the Company and such perticular persons as stand accused thereby, as also to informe and certifie that some of those vnto whome the Referrence is procured are suspected to be the chiefe Abettors and Supporters of Capt: Martin in this buissines. The second addresse to be to the Referrees themselues in like manner as haue bin formerly donne to Capt: Martins Certificate: Wherevpon the Court entreated the Lo: Cauen- dish, Sr Iohn Dãuers, Sr Iohn Brooke, Sr Walter Earle, mr Gibbs, mr Wrote, mr Binge, mr Tomlins, mr Edw: Paulavicine, mr Iermyn, mr Elias ffoxton mr Nicho: ffarrar, mr Caswell mr Iohn Smith and mr Ro: Smith, to meete to morrowe at mr Dep? ffarrars about 2 of the Clocke in the Afternoone to drawe vpp the said Answeare, and to present the same at the Quarter Court. 2. Mr Deputy signified further that one Samuell Each Captaine of the Abigall havinge at his beinge in Virginia made Tryall of those Banck? that lye out in Iames Riuer neare Blunts-pointe and found that a Blockehowse or fforte might be erected vpon them, wch would altogether forbidd the passage of Shipps vpp higher, made offer vnto the Com- panie, if they would imploy his Shippe the Abigall with a reasonable convenient fraight outward and homeward, he would carry a douzin Carpenters at the least, by whome the rest of his Marriners beinge supplied with convenient number of handes from the Colony and some necessaries from hence of Boat? Cordage and Tooles he doubted not by the end of March to raise such a Blockhowse as should secure all the Riuer about it: The Counsell and Co?ittees mett diuers times about it, and havinge receaued good satisfac?on both of the Suffi- ciency of the man for his iudgement and honesty, and also of the probablenes of the meanes, whereby he propounded to effect it, were all of opinion [2] that the offer was not to be refused, the matter of ffortification beinge a thinge soe importunately requested by the Col- ony, and this perticular beinge iudged by diuers of the Planters to be that wch out ?ought? first to be attempted, and most easie to be effected especially consideringe that the Demaunds of Capt Each were so ordinary and reasonable as although the worke should not be effected, yet there would arise noe da?age to the Companie, but as they conceaue it rather a benifitt by the imploying so goodly and stronge a Shippe wherein the Lady Wyatt and the rest that this yeare are to goe may be exceedinge conveniently and safely transported, and the whole Company ?Bodye? duringe their stay in the Riuer much strengthned: Wherefore the Co?ittees proceeded in treaty with Capt: Each and the rest of the owners, and it was agreed on by both parties in the manner followinge, reservinge the confir?acon of the bargaine to the authority of the Quarter Court. 1.That there should be 150 tuñ of goodes and 150 persons or propor- conablie of each, put and laden abourd the said Shippe: the wch num- ber of persons and goodes were conceaued would be verie easily made vpp by priuate Aduenturers. 2.That the persons should repaye vjli a head in hand and for fraight of goodes iijli a Tun should be paid vpon Certificate of the safe deliu- ery of them in Virginia. 3.The Owners of the Shipp desired that the Passengers might be taken in at the Isle of Wight, wch although it were somewhat more charge, yet in matter of health it wilbe doubly recompenced. 4.And that the good? might be deliuered them here by the middle of Iuly they promising by the first of August to be gonn from the Isle of Wight if Winde and weather serue. 5.That they would not take in any more Passengers then the Com- panie should put abourd them, and that duringe the whole voyage the people should haue their full allowance of victuall. 6.That after their vnladinge in Virginia the Shippe should with all convenient expedi?on fall downe to Blunt-pointe, and there Capt: Each would diligently imploye himselfe his Shippe and 12 Carpenters and Marriners to the number of 40, till the end of March in case the buissines be not sooner effected for the erectinge and buildinge of a fforte or Blockehowse, and the Companie vndertaketh and promiseth to supply the said Capt: Each with such a convenient number of people and landmen as shalbe fitt, and requisite duringe the said worke; wch Land-men so sent and imployed should be maynetayned with victuall of their owne at the Collonies charge, but their lodginge should be abourd the Shippe. And the Companies for their partes doe promise. That if this worke be effected they will make his fraight homeward 800li vpon wch all good? Tobacco, Sassafras Cr wch shalbe laden in him shalbe accounted and onely the personall transport of men shalbe excepted: As for the rate and price of the fraight, he shall not make any agreement without the consent of the Gouernor. And that if he performinge his best endeauoures shall not be able to effect it, by the end of March, but for the perfectinge thereof shalbe required to staye a Month or more after he shall haue paid him for euery Months staye 160li by the Gouernor and Colony there and so pro rato, But in case it should happen there by the iudgement of the Gouernor and Counsell of State within one Month the worke proue not feazable, then it shalbe lawfull for him to repaire home the first of Ianuary, and that the Companie shall by that time lade so much Tobacco or other good? abourd him as shall make in fraight 800li besid? personall freight?. And for somuch as for performance of this great worke, there was a matter of 200li required to be disbursed in necessarie prouisions as namely in Axes Shouell? Spad? and a Lighter wch come to the great- est charge beinge estimated at 50li in all wch thing? there could be no losse although the works did not proceed in reguard they would be of great vse to the Colony: mr Deputy therefore moued to knowe the [3] pleasure of the Courte for procuringe the said money seeinge the Co?on Stocke was longe since exhausted and the Companie already fallen into debt (whereof my Lord of Southampton hath willed them to be verie cautious and sparinge) Wherevpon, it beinge taken into considera?on and the importancy of the worke duely waighed, and withall it beinge signified that this money would be repaide againe by the Colony who were contented to be at all the charge and would be readie to make good what Contract soeuer the Company made here with any such Vndertaker, if the Proiect did not proue feazeable; The Court herevpon thought fitt to reco?end it to the Quarter Court to entreat some to take vpp so much money, and that it should be pro- pounded that for his Security he should not only haue the Seale of the Companie, but also all such Co?odities as came from Virginia to the Companies vse should be consigned to him vntill vpon the Sale satisfac?on were giuen for all such debt? and da?ages whatsoeuer as any such should stand engaged for. And forsomuch as it was informed that in the time of Sr Edwin San- dys beinge Treasuror and since there had well neare 5000li: bin paid in old Debt? (due in Sr Thomas Smithes time) to the great exhaust- inge of the co?on Treasurie: This Court thought it equall and iust that if any such debts were claymed hereafter (for wch neither the Companies Seale nor any member of the Companie stood bound to secure by consent of the Company nor did appeare by any order of Court) the parties complayninge should be sent for satisfac?on vnto such as were the Treasuror and Deputies in those times. The Courte takinge into considera?on the request of mr Martin the Persian touching the double charge imposed vpon his Tobacco by the ffearmors for in reguard he was a Stranger and havinge informed themselues of the priuiledge of their Patent, that giues them power to enfranchies Strangers and make them capeable thereby of the like i?unities that themselues enioy; Haue therefore ordered that the Secretary shall repaire to the ffarmors of the Custome with a Coppie of the said Clause and that with the Court? speciall co?enda?on of mr Martin vnto them, and to entreat their fauor toward? him the rather in respect of his good likinge to the Plantation whither he intend? to goe againe, wch may happily encourage other Strangers to the like resolu?on to goe ouer thither. Sr Iohn Dãuers acquainted the Court with the good seruice that mr Waterhouse had donne for the Companie in solicitinge of such as stood endebted vnto them vpon their subscriptions, Amongst whome findinge some Refusers and havinge made request vnto the Lo: Keeper for his letters vnto them, as my lo: Chauncellor had formerly prom- ised to doe (accordinge to the Tenor of his Mats Letters Patents) whereby the Companie are to praye his best assistance, of wch Clause the Lord Keeper beinge informed was desirous to see the priuiledge of their Patent in that pointe: wch for that it could not be deliuered without consent of a Court by reason of §th§ a late order: It was nowe therefore agreed vnto, that mr Waterhouse should haue the Patent to attend his Lop therewith and to bringe it backe againe. It was further also moued that mr Waterhous Account? might be audited and considera?on had of the great paynes he had taken about this buissines, wch the Court hath referred to the Auditors who are to make reporte. A request was likewise made in the behalfe of the Lady Dale who for that her people in Virginia doe not performe couenant? with her accordinge to their Contract?, but wronge her much in the proffitt? of her land due vnto her, for wch cause shee is nowe sendinge ouer a Servant to require it of them, shee therefore desires the Companies Letter of Comenda?on to the Gouernor of Virginia to assist her said Servant in the recouery of her said debt?, wch the Court hath prom- ised shalbe made ready for her Lapp. [4] The Lo: President makinge request vnto the Company by Letter in the behalfe of a kinsman of his nowe goeinge to Virginia, that he may be directed in the best courses, and be respected the rather for his sake, The Courte hath promised to affoord him what fauoure they may and therevpon gaue order for a Letter to be writt to the Gouer- nor to that effect.

Vpon mo?on in reguard the Afternoone was farr spent, it was by a generall consent agreed vnto that the Court should be continued after 6 of the Clocke till all buissinesses were ordered. I?ediately after these buissinesses ?things? were thus ordered, as the Court were proceedinge after their accustomed manner to the elec?on of their Treasuror Deputy and other Officers for this present yeare accordinge to the direc?on of his Mats Letters Patent?, mr Alderman Hamersly rose vpp and havinge first excused his seldome co?inge to Court? by reason of the Officers negligent [12] warninge of him, he said That himselfe and mr Bell were both co?aunded by mr Secretary Caluert to deliuer a Message in his Mats name vnto this Court, namely to signifie, that although it was not his Mats desire to infringe their liberty of free elec?on yet it would be pleasing vnto him, if they made choise for Treasuror and Deputy any of those gentlemen (co?ended for their Sufficiency), whose names were men?oned in the paper nowe presented in open Court wch were these that followe vizt Sr Io: Wolstenholme. Sr Wm Russell. ffor Treasuror were named mr Cletherow. mr Mawrice Abbott. mr Hamford. mr Leat. mr Ro: Oftly. ffor Deputy mr Stiles. mr Abdy. mr Bateman. Mr Bell beinge also entreated to deliuer the Message he had receaved from mr Secretary Caluert said, that he was not present when mr Sec- retary Caluert imparted this Message to mr Alderman Hamersley but that there came a Messenger to him ouer night to require him to attend mr Secretary Caluert at his Chamber and beinge there mr Sec- retary told him, that his Matie commaunded him to signifie his pleas- ure that out of his good wishes (for the good of the Company and the Plantation) he had recomended to this Court certaine Gentlemen (named in the paper nowe presented) if the Company so thought good: But it was not his meaning to infringe the liberty of their free cho[ise]; And beinge desirous to have had this ?his? Message in writinge mr Secretary said it needed not for it was but short. Both wch Messages agreeinge in substance, and beinge a full remon- strance of his Mats well wishinge vnto the Plantation and of his gra- ceous meaninge not to infringe the priuiledge of the Companie and liberty of their free elec?on was receaued with great ioye and con- tentment of the whole Court and therevpon proceedinge to the elec?on of their Treasuror for wch onely three by the orders of the Company could stand for it, It was generally agreed that out of the fiue formerly proposed by his Matie for Treasuror, choise should be made of two of them, to stand in elec?on with one that the Companie should name: Wherevpon the former fiue beinge seuerally put to the question, It appeared by erec?on of most hand? that mr Clethero and mr Hanford were to stand for it: Then the Companie named ?the1 1 Written over the word "my". ? Lord of Southampton who beinge all three accordingly ballated, the place fell to ?the1? Lord of Southampton by havinge 117 balls, mr Clethero 13 and mr Hamfort 7. In like manner out of the fiue formerly named by his Matie for Dep- uty, by erec?on of most hand? mr Leat and mr Bateman were to stand for it, vnto whome the Companie havinge added mr Nicholas ffarrar, they were all three put to the Ballatinge Boxe, and therevpon choise was made of mr Nicholas ffarrar by havinge 103, mr Bateman 10: and mr Leate 5. Wherevpon mr Deputy ?tooke3 2 Changed from the word "takinge." ? his place, ?and? gaue vnto the Court humble thank? for their loue and honoble testimony, wch by electing him to that place, they had giuen him: wherein he professed he should all his life longe exceedingly glory and reioyce, if he could but thinke himselfe worthie thereof: But knowinge well the waightines of the place and his owne great inhabilities, he could not without feare and tremblinge accept thereof: But since he knewe they would not vpon [13] any entreaties of his, alter their choise he humblie sub- mitted himselfe, promising not to faile to the vttermost of his power to performe the charge they had laide vpon him, Humblie beseech- inge the Honoble Lords and the worthie Officers with their Counsell? to direct him and the whole Court in generall with their presence to assist him for the well performinge of the Office they had imposed vpon him, and in perticular besought them to request his Brother mr Iohn ffarrar (in confidence of whose assistance, he well knewe they had made choise of him) to continue the selfe same care and paynes as he had formerly donn without wch he could not hope to performe his place as he ought: Wherevpon mr Iohn ffarrar made promise not to slacke any thinge of that zealous and diligent care ?wth? wch himself had performed that office. Next the Court proceeded to the elec?on of the Auditors confirminge six of those of the last yeare namely Sr Edwin Sandis. mr Gibbs. Sr Io Dãuers. mr Io ffarrar. mr Io: Wroth. mr Kightley. and in respect mr Cranmer had remoued his dwellinge from London whereby he could not attend the buissines mr Bennett was chosen in his place who were all sworne. After this the Court proceeded to the elec?on of the Co?ittees, wch was performed accordinge to the standinge order of the Companie wch doth appointe one fourth parte to be newe elected and the rest by erec?on of hand? to be confirmed (vizt) of the last yeare were confirmed. mr Berblocke. mr Geo: Smith. mr Boothby. mr Bull. mr Wiseman. mr Bennett. mr Caswell. mr Darnelly. mr Biddolph. mr Bland. mr Mellinge. mr Couell. vnto whome were nowe added. mr Meuerell. mr Barbor. mr Wheatly. mr Seaward. who did all of them take their oath. Edward Collingwood S?cre William Webbe Husband were confirmed in their former places and tooke their oath. ffrancis Carter Beadle Itt was moued to bestowe on mr Iohn Farrar the late Deputy some propor?on of land, as a Testimonyall of the Companies thankfull acknowledgmt and approba?on of the generall ?greate and? faithfull seruice performed by him in the place of Deputy the three last years, and accordingly it beinge put to the question there were giuen vnto him 20 shares of old Aduenture: And it was further ordered that together with the Guift it selfe it should be entred in the Court booke, that the Court conceaued his merritt? so great, as if their greater liberality had not by their lawe bin bounded within the compasse of 20 shares, they would for him haue exceeded it with farr larger pro- por?on. [14] Itt beinge moued that there might be some presenta?on of the Com- panies humble thankfullnes vnto his Matie in respect of the graceous Message formerly deliuered after some delibera?on had therevponn the Court conceaued it fitt to be sett downe in these words (vizt) That the Lord Cauendish the Lo: Padgett the Lo: Haughton are humbly requested by the Court to present their most humble thank? to his Matie for his graceous remembrance and good wishes to their affaires out of wch he was graceously pleased to recomend certaine persons for Treasuror and Deputy if they so thought fitt, but without any infringement of their liberty of free elec?on; And they were further humbly requested to signify and testifie vnto his Matie the great respect and reverence wherewith his message was receaued and howe in conformity therevnto, although they had formerly accordinge to their custome in their Præparatiue Court nominated the Ea: of Southampton for Treasuror, yet out of the persons reco?ended by his Matie they choose fower who had most voices and put them in elec?on with two nominated by the Company vpon whome the places were conferred by an vnanimous consent of the Company, havinge founde the Plantation to prosper euery of these three last yeares, more then in ten before, and found more to haue bin donn with Ten thou- sand pounds, then formerly with fower score thousand: And they conceaued also that in reguard the Staple Comodities of Iron, Silke, Wyne, Salt, Cr are nowe in establishinge and perfectinge: As also that the Gouerment of that Country is to be confirmed, that equall sufficiency for direc?on would not so much aduance the Planta?on, as the variablenes of Instruc?ons proceedinge from different conceptions would preiudice the buissines. The seuerall Patent? examined and approued of in the forenoone were nowe put to the question and ordered to be sealed vizt. To Sr Io: Brooke a?s Cobham To mr Tho: Bulkly To mr ffran: Harwell Aduenturers To mr Edmund Wynn To Capt: Dan: Tucker To Sr Bowyer Worsley To mr Ro: Moston Planters To Capt Hen: Pelham Also priuate Patents for shares giuen by the Quarter Court (vizt) To mr Io: Bonnall. To Capt Sam: Each. To mr Io: Balmford. It beinge moued that it might be free for Aduenturors and Planters to take Duplicat? of their Patents vnder the Companies Seale, it was generally held verie fittinge, and therevpon ordered that such as desired duplicat? being engrossed and wittnessed by the Secretary to be agreeable to their originall might haue the Seale therevnto affixed. [15] Whereas at a Court held the Thirteenth of ffebruary last The Com- pany thought fitt to bestowe 2 shares of land old Aduenture in Vir- ginia vpon Iohn Clarke in reward of the good seruice he had donn the Company in transportinge of people and Cattle to Virginia wch beinge referred to this Court for confirma?on, The same are nowe accordingly ratified vnto him and ordered to passe vnder the Seale at the next Quarter Court as vnto others.</field>

My Lo: of Southampton beinge nowe present signified vnto the Court that he was content to accept the place of Treasuror for the yeare ensueinge accordinge to their elec?on wherein he would be ready to ?forme the best seruice he could for the Companie and Planta?on, hopinge they would please as formerly to dispence with his absence when either his Mats seruice or his owne vrgent occasions did with- drawe him wch the Court willingly condiscended vnto, with humble and harty acknowledgement of their bounden thankfullnes vnto his lp: for his noble fauor and affec?on vnto the Planta?on vnder whome it had pleased God to prosper it so well in the two preceedent yeares of his gouerment, as there was nowe greater hopes then euer of a flourishinge State and Co?on Wealth in Virginia, and so his lp: tooke his oath. My Lo: Cauendish acquainted the Court with his Mats Answeare vnto the Message he deliuered in the name of the Companie in the presence of my Lo: Haughton and diuers others of the Counsell that attended them. ffirst concerninge the peti?on he presented to the Kinge in Answeare of Capt: Martins, wherein the Company through iust suspi?on of par- tiality in some of the former Referrees desired the matter might be referred together with those ?s in the first referrence, to certaine other Lords of his Mats most honoble Priuy Councell, whome they nominated: his Matie said he much wondred at this newe [16] sprunge vp custome that Peti?oners should nominate their owne Referrees, to wch his lp: made Answeare that in that pointe Capt: Martin had bin their exam- ple who in his peti?on wch his lp: then shewed his Matie had named his owne Referrees wch his Matie had approued. Touchinge the Account of the last yeares Supplie wch he likewise pre- sented vnto the Kinge his Matie graceously accepted thereof. Lastly vpon presentinge the Companies most humble thanke? vnto his Matie for the graceous message deliuered by mr Alderman Hamersly and mr Bell signifyinge that in proposinge the persons men?oned in the paper for Treasuror and Deputy it was not his Mats meaninge to infringe the liberty of their free elec?on; Wherevpon choise beinge made of two of each proposed by his Matie to stand in elec?on with two others named by the Companie they beinge all put to the Ballatinge Boxe, the elec?on fell vpon my Lord of Southampton for Treasuror (vnder whose gouerment the Planta?on had exceedingly prospered and encreased) and vpon mr Nicho: ffarrar for Deputy; But his Matie seemed not well satisfied that out of so large a number by him rec- o?ended they had not made any choise: His Matie Conceauinge that Marchante? were fittest for the gouerment of that Plantation in respect of their skill and habilities for raisinge of Staple Comodities, and instancinge Sr Tho: Smith in whose times many Staple Comodities were sett vpp wch were nowe laid downe and onely Tobacco followed to wch his lp: made Answr that in this pointe as likewise in many other perticulers touchinge the Companie and their proceedinge? his Matie had bin much misinformed, the followinge of Tobacco onely and the neglectinge of all staple Co?odities haue bin the fruite? of Sr Thomas Smiths and Alderman Iohnsons times but on the contrary euer since it hath bin laboured with all industrie care and diligence to erect Iron-Mille? Plant Vineyarde? nourish Silke and other like, of some whereof they hoped very shortly to giue his Matie good proufe, and that since the time of Sr Thomas Smith, the Colony had growne almost to as many Thousande? of people as he left hundrede? good encrease hath bin also of the Cattle: And that with ten thousand pounds expence there had bin more ?formed for the aduancement of the Planta?on then by Sr Thomas Smith with fowerscore Thousande?: And further his lp did assure his Matie that some of those persons rec- omended beinge present in Court did then and most of them haue otherwise publiquely since acknowledged and proffessed that they would neuer haue accepted of those places, professinge themselues through want of experience and aboundance of other imploymente? so disable that they should haue brought backe the buissines more in one yeare then it had gonn forward in these last three so that the choosinge of them had bin the hazardinge of the whole Planta?on. My Lo: of Southampton signified to the Court that himselfe and some others of his Mats Counsell for Virginia together with ye Gouernor and Assistante? of the Su?er Ilande? had nowe (before the settinge of the Court) been consultinge about a waightie Proposition made vnto them from my Lord Treasuror wch they conceaued might turne to the benifitt of both the Plantations: Wch Proposition his lp: entreated Sr Edwin Sandys (as best acquainted with the manner of it) to relate vnto the Court. [17] Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys signified that my Lo: Treasuror out of his personall Duety as also the duety of his place bendinge his thoughte? to the aduanceinge of his Mats proffitt and Revenue, and yet carefull to avoyde greivinge of his Mats Subiecte? and in perticular out of his Noble affec?on and well wishinge to the Plantation, wherein himselfe was one of the most auncient Aduenturers, as also of longe time a Counsellor for the same had bin pleased of late to make an overture to him for contractinge with the two Companies of Virginia and Su?er Ilands for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco into England, as also into the Realmes of Ireland: The graunt whereof havinge in these two former yeares been managed by other Contractors to the discontent and perhapps Detriment of the said Plantations, they might nowe haue the Grant thereof made vnto themselues and consequently haue the sole managinge of all that Comodity with reserua?on of a valuable rent to his Matie wch he thought might redound to the great benefitt of the Planta?ons. Touchinge wch Proposition his lp: desired to knowe his opinion in priuate before it were further published, Sr Edwin Sandys professinge his ingorance in matters of that nature desried to haue some other associated with him, wch his lp: well likeinge of, and giuinge him his ownce choise, he chose Sr Arthur Ingram, who then was present beinge likewise an auncient Aduenterer and Councellor for the Plantation and who vpon all occasions did manifest his great good affec?on to it. Sr Edwin Sandys and Sr Arthur Ingram fallinge into a consulta?on amongst themselues touchinge this Proposition and consideringe ye vncertainty of this deceaueable weede Tobacco wch serued neither for necessity nor for ornament to the life of man, but was founded onely vpon an humor wch might soone vanish into smoake and come to nothing, whereby the vpholding of any great rent to his Matie to be raised out of that Co?odity might in a short time bankrupt the Com- panies, and vtterly ruine the Planta?ons: conceaued that it was a much safer waye for the Companies rather to yeald vnto his Matie a certaine propor?on out of the Tobacco it selfe in specie then a certaine Revenue in money, being subiect to so great danger. This Answeare within a fewe dayes after they returned to his lp: who requiringe their opinion what propor?on they thought fitt, Sr Edwin Sandys made Answeare that the Comodity beinge managed by men of skill and dexterity he thought that if the Companies should yeald to his Matie a fourth part of the proffitt thereof it might raise vnto him a verie faire Revenue, And for his owne priuate opinion he thought it not impossible that the Companies (taking all circumstances into their ?due? considera?on) might yeald to that fourth part, so as to be discharged of all other burdens. His lp: herevpon fallinge into a calcula?on of the quantitie of Tobacco yearely spent in these Kingdomes, as also of the prices at wch it might be sold concluded that without the Grant of a Third part, there could not be that revenue raised to his Matie as was expected, and as for other charges his lp: answeared that the old Custome of vjd and iiijd the pound beinge already graunted to his Mats ffarmors it might needs be [18] paid, for otherwise the Defalca?ons wch the ffarmors would de?aund might swallowe vp the greatest parte of his Mats Rent in- tended, how beit he would helpe to bringe the matter to a reasonable composi?on and such as might be no great burden to the Companie. In conclusion his lp: aduised Sr Edwin Sandys to comunicate this Proposi?on first wth the Gouernor and Deputies of the two Companies and if they did approue of his lps opinion who conceaued it might redound to the great benifitt of the Plantations and that in more respect? then one, beinge duely waighed and considered, they might proceed to impart it to the Companies so to receaue their resolu?on and further direc?on. Accordinge wherevnto Sr Edwin Sandys hauinge acquainted both their ?ps then present and the Deputies of the Companies with the offer and nature of this Contract proposed And their ?ps havinge co?- unicated the same to the Counsell of the one Company and Assistants of the other they all thought it fitt that the same should be proposed to the considera?ons of the Companies wch accordinge to their ?ps co?and he had nowe performed. Wherevpon after some pause and delibera?on the Companie signified their general well likinge of it: but withall desired that it might not be concluded vpon vntill such time as they had better considered of euery perticular matter and circumstance thereto incident and deliu- ered theri opinions thereof either by writinge or otherwise. Touchinge wch it was answeared that nothinge could be yealded vnto to binde the Company without the consent of a Quarter Court, wherer- vnto the ratifica?on of this buissines must be referred: Wherevpon it beinge put to the question first whither they liked to entertayne this Proposition in generall on such condi?ons as should be afterward agreed and assented vnto by themselues: The whole Court with an vnanimous consent signified their approba?on thereof. Next it was propounded and thought fitt that a Comittee of either Companie should be appointed to treat and consider of the matter of this Contract and out of their number to select some to treat with my Lord Treasuror from time to time about it. Wherevpon for the Virginia Companie these eight by erec?on of hand? were chosen (vizt) The Ea: of Southampton. mr Nico ffarrar Dp?. Sr Io: Brooke. mr Bennet. Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Io: Smith. Sr Io: Dãuers. mr Ro: Smith. After this the Virginia Court beinge dissolued into a Su?er Ilande? Court and the Lo: Cauendish Gouernor of the said Companie takinge the Chaire, Choise was made of six for that ?ye? Company vizt the Lo: Cauendish. mr Caswell Tr?r. mr Bernard ye elect Gouernor. mr Gibbs. mr Io: ffarrar Deputy. mr Ditchfeild. who are entreated by the Court to take the premises into their con- sidera?on and to make report from time to time of their proceedinge? vnto the Court, that their opinions and aduises may be also had therein.

Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that Sr Nicho: Lower whose Breth- ren had bin large Aduenturers longe agoe, was nowe himselfe resolued to come into this buissines, wherevnto alwayes he had borne a zealous affec?on and had brought in 25li for the purchase of two shares wch the Court verie gladly accepted ?of? and a Bill of Aduenture was Sealed vnto him for two shares and the money deliuered to mr Iohn Cuffe the Companies Casheer. It pleased the Right Honoble the Lord Cauendish to passe ouer one of his shares of land in Virginia vnto mr Hobbs wch beinge allowed of by the Auditors was also approued and ratified by the Court. After the readige of the former Quarter Court mr Deputy acquainted the Company with diuers complainte? that had bin exhibited to his Matie by peti?ons against the Virginia Company, wch his Matie had bin graceously pleased to referr to Sr Christofer Perkins one of the Mais- ters of Requeste? with order to call the Deputy of the Company and some others before them to require their Answeares therevnto; Accordingly himself and some other of the Companie had bin before Sr Christofer Perkins, where they found diuers peti?ons had bin preferred against the Companie where they also found Capt: Martin and Captaine Hazell attendinge their cominge who had exhibited two peti?ons to his Matie complayninge in their first that the Virginia Companie denied him the said Captaine Martin the frui?on of those priuiledges contayned in his said Patent, wherevnto the Companie had former[mer]ly giuen their Answeare: in their second peti?on to his Matie Capt: Martin and Capt: Hazell (with many others vñamed) entituled his Matie to a large parte of Virginia beinge fower score miles in circuite wch should be sett out by Sr Tho: Dale as the Kings fforrest. [20] To the Kings moast excellent Maty The Humble Petition of Captayne Iohn Martyn esq And Captayne Robert Haswell wth many others.1 1 The caption of this petition is the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The handwriting changes from this point to that of the unidentified copyist referred to above as the "Fourth Copyist." Humbly sheweth to yor most excellent Matie that whereas in time of Sr Tho: Dale Gouernor for yor Matie in Virginia there was a great quantitie of Woodland Marish and other grounds beinge in circum- ference by estima?on fower score Miles or thereaboute? for wch ground he did compound with Powhatan the Indian Kinge or cheife of that place and bounded the same out with markeable Trees and other Marke? of perpetuall knowledge and remembrance with a solemne procession also of many yor Mats Subiects then and there liuinge comaundinge notice to giuon ?be taken? thereof and to be alwayes entituled and called the Kinge? fforrest. In wch fforrest of yor Mats there is of Deare and wild Swine a verie great number that beinge preserued with care and iudgement from the continuall hauocke and spoile that is and wilbe made of them and their brood, By wch preserva?on yor Mats Colony may be continually nourished and Shippinge at all times plentifully victualled with Corne and Porke Baken and Deeres fflesh beside? there is many other prof- fitable Comodities alleady knowne Yor Petitionrs therefore most humbly beseecheth yor most sacred Maty to be pleased to take the said fforrest into yor owne hande? and to appoint some honoble person to ?be? the Co?- ander thereof, authorisinge him to giue order for Planta?ons thereon for yor Mats best behoufe and proffitt Giuinge order also for a Iustice of oyer and Rangers and other officers as shalbe thought most convenient for the said fforrest and Plan- ta?on. And yor Peti?oners shall praye for yor Mats happie and longe raigne ouer vs. Vnto this Petition as a matter of great consequence Sr Christofer Perkins required in his Mats name a speedie Answeare: Wherevpon the Counsell hauinge mett in the morninge, and taken it into con- sidera?on framed an Answeare therevnto wch doth here ensue. [21] The Aunsweare of the Counsell and Compagny for Virginia assembled in a generall Courte to the Petition of Captayne Iohn Martyn and Capt: Robert Hassell wth many others unnamed touching that which they call the Kings Forrest in Virginia1 1 The caption and first four words of this document are the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The sayde Counsell and Companie for aunsweare therevnto saye that they acknowledge no Kinge of Virginia but Kinge Iames, of and vnder whome they hold and not from ?king? Powhatan so named by the Petitioners. True it is that for a permanent honor as well to his royall Matie the ffounder of that Plantation as also ?to? his Princely Issue they haue named both their chiefe Citties as also other places most remarkeable with the names of his Matie and of his Children wch they suppose doth noe waye alter the proprietie of Inheritance in those places wch his Matie by his letters Patente? vnder his great Seale hath graunted to the said Companie for and throughout all Virginia. Touchinge the Kinge? fforrest so named in the peti?on, it is a name happily knowne to Capt: Martin and his Associate? but not to the Company and in the circuit of that Territory wch they are pleased to call the fforrest are placed both Iames City beinge the principall Citty in Virginia and place of residence for the Gouernor &amp; Counsell and also diuers other principal planta?ons and namely that of the Citty of London. Touchinge the Deere it is true that generally the whole Countrie of Virginia is replenished with them, but for the Swyne they are no other then ye breed of such as haue bin transported thither by the Companie: And it is strange vnto them yt Capt: Martin who is said to haue ruined aswell his owne State (if euer he had any) as also the estate of other who put him in trust (as namely Capt: Bargraue) &amp; who hath made his owne Territory there a Receptacle of Vagabonde? and bankerupte? &amp; other disorderly ?sons &amp; whereof there hath bin made publi? complaint and who is famous for nothinge but all kinds of base condi?ons so published in print by the Relaters of the proceedinge? of the Colony aboue 10 yeares since, and who for the said condi?ons was Displaced by the Lord D' Lawarr from beinge of the Counsell as a most vnworthie per- son and who hath presumed of his owne authority (no way deriued from his Matie) to giue vniust sentence of death vpon diuers of his Mats Subiecte? &amp; seen the same put in cruell execu?on, should dare to offer himselfe to his Sacred Matie as an Agent either for matter of good husbandrie or good order. And as for Capt: Hazell he is neither Aduenturer in the Companie nor Plantr in Colony but a meere strangr to both nor otherwise knowne vnto them then as an Interpreter to a Polonian Lord of his owne creatinge. But if his Matie should be pleased to giue ?haue? a Royall demeasne sett out for his Maty his heires and Successors in Virginia to be and so be called for euer, the Kinge? land there could be nothinge more ioyfull to the said Counsell &amp; Companie nor wherein they would more willingly imploy their vttermost endeauors for the advanceinge of a perpetuall standinge Revenue to his Matie. The Court entred into an exact discussement of all the perticular pointe? therein, and hauinge heard it twice read confirmed the same, and for deliuery thereof to Sr Christofr Perkins, they humbly besought the Lord Cauendish the Lord Haughton Sr Edwin Sandys, and desired the gentlemen that had formerly bin with Sr Christofor Perkins to attend them. [22] Mr Peirs the Capemarchant takinge notice of Captaine Martins Deniall of protectinge any within his Territories from arest for debt affirmed that havinge deliuered divers Warrante? to the Prouost Marshall of Iames Citty in Virginia, to be serued vpon men that were indebted lyvinge loosely within Captaine Martins Plantation, the Prouost Mar- shall told him that the said Capt: Martin resisted the Officer and drewe Armes vpon him and would not suffer him to execute the said Warrante?. Wm Capps and one Grindon also affirmed that it was comonly reported that Capt: Martins Plantation was a place of refuge for such as were indebted whither they co?only fled and were protected. Captaine Rossingham likewise affirmed the same and that if Capt Martin had bin of power, there had bin no livinge in Virginia. Mr Jefferson reported likewise that to his knowledge Captaine Martin beinge su?oned refused to obey the generall Assemblies. As each man had deliuered this his reporte of Captaine Martin the Court caused it againe to be read vnto euery of them who affirmed the same to be truely sett downe as they deliuered it nowe openly in Court, and that they would be ready to iustifie the same vpon their oath. Mr Deputy further presented a peti?on that one Adam Dixon had exhibited to his Matie. Also an Attesta?on of greivances in Virginia exhibited by one Wm Kempe, vnto both wch Sr Christo: Perkins in his Mats name required the Companies Answeare: Accordingly wherevnto the Companie ?Counsell? had drawne two seuerall Answeares. To the Kings most excellent Maty The humble petition of Adam Dixon of Virginia1 1 The caption and first four words of this document are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. Humbly sheweth to your most Excellent Matie that whereas yor Peti?oner was hired for Virginia for the seruice of the Companie and Colony as mr-Calker of the Shippe and Vessells as occasion requireth and there to serue them for the space of 3 yeares at the rate of 36s the Moneth wch time and seruice hauing fully and faithfully performed, yet beinge afterward forceably detayned for the seruice of the Colony in their imployment for the terme &amp; time of seauen yeares or thereabout, Also whereas Captaine Argall in the time of his Gouermt gaue vnto yor peticonr and one Io: Berrey a peece of ground vncleared to build vs a howse wch he ?wee? did to ye cost and charg of 100li yor peti? hath vntill this day neuer receaued any more money for recompence &amp; satisfac?on of his time &amp; seruice but 3li 13s So there remayneth due vnto yor Peti?oner by the Companie 150li 8s or thereaboute? likewise yor peticonr and Io: Berry was this last yeare turned out of their sd howse &amp; ground by Sr Geo: Yeardley contrary to all equity iustice or conscience to or great discomfort &amp; other vndoeinge. Yor peticon9 therefore humbly beseecheth yor sacred Matie to be pleased to graunt vs yor most graceous Reference to the right wor?: Sr Ro: Mamsell &amp; Sr Christo: Perkins Kinghte? to heare &amp; take order for our redresse accordinge to equity &amp; right or otherwise to certifie yor Matie what their wisdoms shall thinke fitt to be donn therein. And yor Peti?oners shall euer pray for yor Mats longe and happie raigne ouer vs. [23] 19 Iunij 1622 ?The Answr of the Counsell and Company for Virginia assembled in a generall Court to the peti?on of Adam Dixon The said Counsell and Company for answr therevnt say Cr ? this Aunsr infra.? The greevances of certayne Inhabitants of Kikatan in Virginia now called Eliza- beth Citty by the testimony of William Kemp for thees named and divers others1 1 This paragraph and the first five words of the following paragraph are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. Humbly sheweth yt William Iulian was by Capt: Argall then Gouernor allotted vnto him a proporcon of land possessed thereof and built a howse at his owne charge ?cost? worth 30li &amp; was after by ye co?and of Sr Geo: Yeardly ?then Gouernor? turned out of Doores, wch Iulian did also mayntaine at his owne charge for 3 Moneths 4 men wch was also taken away from him to serue their vse without any recompence also. Iohn Bush hauinge two howses paid for before the said Gouernor came in was in like man9 turned out and Capt: Nuce put in possession of the same by Sr George Yeardley contrary to all right and equity whereby he lost all his goode? and his wife in that extreamity miscarried with her child. The Brother of the said Iohn Bush beinge then dead in the howse and his wife great with Child was likewise turned out. Iohn Powell was in like manner turned out of Doores and forced to forsake his howse wch he had built at a great charge and had cleared much ground wch was verie chargeable to him also. Thomas Brewer hauinge by casualty his howse burnt and had built another &amp; cleared much ground was likewise supplanted and turned out of Doores not- withstandinge he had it confirmed vnto him vnder the Scale of the Companie Colony. Thomas Willoby had newly hired a howse and was likewise turned out. Iohn Gundry with his wife and Child hauinge at his owne cost built a howse was also turned out of Doores. All or the most of these was of longe continuance auncient Planters and the best members of the first mechanicke Trade?. Wm Kempe wilbe sworne that this is true. By me Wm Kempe. 19 Iunij 1622 The Aunsweare of the Counsell and Compagny for Virginia assembled in a generall Courte to the petition of Adam Dixon.1 1 The caption of this document is in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The said Counsell and Companie for aunsweare therevnto say, that the matters therein contayned are to them vtterly vnknowne, &amp; such as they haue no inducemente? to ?swade them to be true, neither is there extant in their booke? the men?on of any such Contract for ought they can finde &amp; if any such were it must haue bin made in the time of Sr Tho: Smith when he was Treasuror and by his authority vnto whome they referr him for aunsweare and satis- fac?on, touchinge the other part of his owne complainte against Sr George Yeardley who was likewise chosen Gouernor of Virginia in the said time of Sr Tho: Smith and by his consent: if he hath co?itted the wronge and outrage alleged in the said peti?on, whereof the peticonr neuer as yet complained either to the said Counsell or Companie, they will take a course for redresse thereof with all possible expedi?on by co?ending the same to the care of the Gouernor and Counsell nowe resiant in Virginia. The Aunsweare of the Counsell and Compagny for Virginia assembled in a generall Courte to ye Greivances in Virginia exhibited by William Kempe.2 2 The caption and first three words of this document are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The sayde Counsell and Companie for answr therevnto saye yt none of ye ?ties ?tended to be wronged by ye said greivances haue to this Day made any com- plaint thereof to ye said Counsell or Companie &amp; therefore they haue no cause to conceaue them to be true ye rather for yt the said Wm Kempe doth not so much as pretend in his said Complaint any authority from the said ?ties greived to exhibite ye same; neither yet hath exhibited it to ye Counsell or Companie where right might haue bin donn, himselfe havinge bin in England this Twelue- month &amp; vpward wch is an argmnt of suspi?on yt he hath rather bin sett on by some other mens mallice then moued wth zeale of right &amp; iustice. Howbeit ye said Counsell &amp; Companie will with ye next oppertunity (accord- inge to their custome in causes of like nature) transmitt the said complt to ye Gouernor &amp; Counsell resiant in Virginia yt if any Trueth may appeare in any part thereof they may proceed aswell to a due reforma?on of ye said greiuances as also to ye condigne punishmt of the persons charged to be Delinquente?. [24] The peti?ons were read and the Answeare approued by the Court and the deliuery of them to Sr Christofer Perkins recomended to the former Co?ittee. Capt: Mr Deputy signified further that one Capt: So?ers in a peti?on to his Matie had entituled his Matie to the Su?er Ilands and to 12000li for the Ambergreece that was there founde, the Answeares therevnto although it properly belonged to the Su?er Ilande?

The Virginia Companie vnderstandinge of this Discouery did challenge it as their right beinge 100 leagues at the least without distance of their Graunt: the said Companie sent a Gouernor with men to take that possession from yor Matie and findinge yor Peti?oners men to be still lyvinge who found by their industrie and a cake of Ambergreece of 160li waight the the said Gouernor hearinge thereof did violently take it from them to the vse of the Companie who sold it for 12000li and offered violence to those men for the confessinge of more.

The sayde Gouernour and Compagny for aunsweare therunto say1 1 The caption and preceding words of this document are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. That true it is that the Companie for Virginia at their owne great charges furnished and sett out Sr Tho: Gate? and Sr Geo: Su?ers Knts with a fleet of diuers Shippes and some hundrede? of people in a voyadge to Virginia, of wch the said Sr Tho: Gate? to ?bee? Leiutenent Gouernor and to hold the cheife place of Gouerment in the absence of the Lo: D'Lawarr then Gouernor of Virginia and Sr Geo: Su?ers to be Admirall. pag. 24. And it is also true that the said Sr Tho: Gats and Sr Geo: Su?ers passing both in one Shippe were forced by fowle weather and a leake in their Shippe to ruñ her vp vpon the rocke? of the Ilande? then called Barmudaes and nowe ye Su?er Ilande?. ffrom whence hauinge built a smale Ship and pinnace they went on to Virginia with intent to sent a Shippe backe to the said Barmudaes for the bringinge of hogge? from thence to Virginia (whereof in the said Barmudaes they found great store and in the meane time were left behinde three of ye Companies men vpon other occasions then in ye said peti?on is men?oned It beinge then conceaued that the said Ilands laye nearer to Virginia then afterwarde? proued, and consequently that they belonged vnto the Companie of Virginia (by ver- tue of an originall graunt from his Matie) wch afterwarde? appearinge to be otherwise they were humble Suitors vnto his Matie for an enlargement of ye said former graunt whereby the said Barmudaes might be conteyned within their lymitte? wch they also obtayned, In wch meane time Sr Geo: Su?ers beinge sent backe from Virginia to the Barmudaes for transportinge of the said Hogge? by reason it was conceaued that those Ilande? lyinge lowe would not easily be found againe but by a man of great skill in all passages by sea, such as was Sr Geo: Su?ers, It pleased God that there he ended his Dayes, and the peti?oner Mathewe Su?ers Kinsman to Sr Geo: Su?ers but not his heire (contrary to the trust and intended purpose of that voyage) in stead of returninge wth the said Hogge? for Virginia perswaded the Marriners to come away for England where the said Mathewe Su?ers hath euer since continued for ought that the Companie knoweth without ?formance of any the least service for behoufe of either Plantation: The Companie for Virginia havinge obtained the said graunt of the Barmudaes from his Matie and findinge it verie convenient for a strength to Virginia to be planted and peopled beinge not able to effect the same at their co?on charge did passe their right awaye to diuers principall Members of their Companie vndertakinge for the plantinge and peopling of the same. And afterwards vpon surrender of the said graunt vnto the Kinge his Matie was pleased vnder his great Seale to graunt the said Ilande? vnto the said Vnder- takers and to incorporate them by the name of ye Companie of the Citty of London for ye planting of ye said Barmudaes from thence forward to be called by the name of ye Su?er Ilande? ffor the plantinge and peoplinge whereof the said Companie haue Dispended of their owne proper goodes to the Su?e of one hundred thousand marke? &amp; vpwarde?. And they saye further yt true it is, yt the said 3 men left behinde in ye said Ilande? as aforesaid hapned to finde one Blocke of Ambergreece of a verie great value, The right wherevnto was graunted to the said Companie for the Sumer Ilande? by ye Companie for Virginia at whose charges and in whose seruice ye said three men were sett out and imployed, notwithstandinge by reason of vnderhand conveyance away of the said Ambergreece the said Companie for the Su?er Ilande? neuer recouered aboue one Third part of ye said blocke of Ambergreece the certen value whereof they are not able to deliuer, by reason that the then Gouernor of the said Companie (beinge then also their Treasuror) hath hitherto refused to deliuer vp to the said Companie an account of their Tresury, And touchinge the Third part of the said Ambergreece wch came vnto the possession of ye then Gouernor of their Companie &amp; wherevnto they conceaue they had a iust and lawfull title, they haue notwithstandinge com- pounded for the same with the finders there of aforesaid, so as none of them haue any cause to complaine of ye said Companie and least of all the said Mathewe Su?ers who had no interest therein. And as for the said peticonrs Demaund of ye right of ye said Sr Geo: Su?ers in Virginia for his pretended Aduenture, beinge farr short of ye So?e sett downe in ye said peti?on, ye said Company saith yt ye said Mathew Su?ers beinge not right heire to ye said Sr Geo: Su?ers (as was confessed by his Solicitor one Capt: Baylie in open Court) can haue no iust pretence to the same, but that ye Companie for Virginia haue alwayes shewed themselues verie willinge to doe all right to ye true heires of Sr Geo: Su?ers with as much fauour and assist- ance as they may reasonably desire: And Although ye said Mathewe Su?ers haue no iust cause to stile himselfe an auncient either Aduenturer or Planter consideringe his short aboad there and soddaine returne without license: And the said Companie for Virginia haue bin greatly wronge by his Solicitor, ye said Capt: Baily whome it seemeth nothinge can satisfie but ye distruc?on of both ye Plantations, yet if there be any thinge of right belonginge vnto the said Mathewe So?ers vpon notice giuen thereof he may receaue all fitt satisfac?on. This beinge ye true state of ye matters complayned of in ye said peti?on The said Gouernor and Company forbeare to make aunsweare to a multitude of other ?ticularities therein contayned: The same being either friuoulous or void of all coulor of trueth. [26] A mo?on was made in the behalfe of mr Edward Iohnson that in respect his father Sr Robert Iohnson deceased was an Auncient Aduen- turer he might therefore be admitted to enioye his ffathers right beinge his next heire and that he might haue a Patent with as much fauor as the Companie do graunt to any other auncient Aduenturers, both wch requeste? the Court condiscended vnto and gaue order for a Patent to be drawne against the next Court. Vpon the earnest desire of diuers Aduenturors that mr Copland would please to goe to Virginia and applie himselfe to the Ministry there: A mo?on was made that forsomuch as he had deserued so well of the Companie by his good mo?ons and endeauors wch haue redounded much to the honor and benifitt of the Plantation, as also in respect of his owne sufficiency and worth (where of he hath giuen so ample tes- timony, that therefore some extraordinary care be had for his placeinge and entertainement in Virginia in good manner wch mo?on was well approued of and therevpon the Court referred it to a Comittee to treat and aduise about the same vpon next Satturday morninge at mr Deputy ffarrars vizt Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Caswell. mr Gibbs. mr Meuerell. mr Nich fferrar Dp? mr Roberte? mr Io: ffarrar mr Mellinge mr Binge. or any fower. Sr Iohn Bourchiers request by letter for his Sonn Whittakers returne for England who (as he saith) intendeth not to staye here any longer from his Wife and Child, whome he meanes to leaue behinde him, then he can furnish himselfe with necessaries, is referred to the former Co?ittee to be considered of. The peti?on of Thomas Goldsmith Ann Minters and some others were also referred to the considera?on of any fower of the former Comittee to be ordered and reported of to the next Court. At the same time was presented the peti?on of Widdowe Smalley con- cerninge fower Oxen in the Colony wherevnto she pretended right by Graunt from Capt: Argall, The same Oxen hauinge formerly bin her Husbands, vpon occasion of wch peti?on report was made to the Com- panie of diuers suspitious proceedinge? concerninge the same, as namely that the said Widdowe Smalley had first exhibited a peti?on and greuious complainte? to the Kinge against Capt: Argall for hauinge spoiled her of all her goodes, wch peti?on beinge referred by his Matie to the Counsell for Virginia there was after some time brought in a retracta?on of that peti?on and Complaint against Captaine Argall vnder her hand and Seale; wherein shee also charged others (but without any name) to be incident inciters to her to make that complaint: wch retracta?on her selfe first desired might be read in open Court: And the same was afterwarde? much pressed by Captaine Argall: but the [27] Counsell denied it, vnles shee would first name those that had bin her Incyters, the rather for that Capt: Argall with some extraordinary vehemency declared, that he suspected some of the Companie to haue so sett her on worke, and beinge vrged to declare whom he suspected, he in fine named that he had suspected Sr Edwin Sandys. After wch time Widdowe Smalley repairinge to some number of the Councell assembled together (of wch number was the Lord Cauen- dish, mr Gibbs, mr Wrote the two Deputies and others) shee renued vnto them her complaint against Captaine Argall for wch beinge reproued, (havinge before vnder hand and Seale retracted the same) shee answeared that shee was forced therevnto by Capt: Argall who had caused that writinge to be made at the Dors Co?ons and refused to sett ouer vnto her, her Husbands Executorshippe vnles shee sett her hand and Seale to that writinge, the matter whereof shee said shee did not well vnderstand, contrariwise shee iustified her former complainte made to the Kinge against Capt: Argall protestinge she was by no other meanes moued therevnto, but by the wronge? he had donn her, and that the Peti?on was drawne by a freind of hers dwellinge in Tower street at her request. Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys (beinge then present in Court) protested that he neuer in his life spake worde to the said Widdowe Smalley otherwise then in passinge by as shee solicited him, about her peti?ons neither euer sent Message to her either directly or indirectly, And he said that he had not deserued of Capt: Argall or any man ele? that he should entertaine so vnworthie a suspition against him, havinge donne nothinge against Capt: Argall otherwise then he was bound to doe by vertue of his place at what time he was Treãr, as also of his oath vpon complaint made against him for so great a depreda?on in the Colony when he was deputy Gouernor, wch complaint against Captaine Argall neither moued from him neither yet in the yeare wherein he was Treasuror, but findinge it a foote it was his Duty to bringe it to Tryall by lawfull meanes wherein he alwayes followed the Counsells direc- ?ons: And although Captaine Argall by meanes of his great frende? had not bin proceeded with, to a full and finall Tryall; yet the mat- ters against him were still in force and validity his Answeares vnto them hitherto hauing giuen litle or no satisfac?on as he conceaued. Vpon this occasion it was moued by diuers of the Court that the Let- ters written by Sr Thomas Smith and mr Alderman Johnson then Treãr and Deputy aswell to the Lord D'Lawarr as to Capt: Argall himself might be openly read in Court wch was accordingly donne the Coppies whereof doth here followe. A Coppy of a letter sent to Captayne Argoll in the good shipp the William and Thomas.

Wee make noe doubte but hee hath deliuered the Gouerment wth an accompt of his doings into your Lõps hands. Wee haue received from him by the George a very straunge letter which together wth those Informations yt wee haue agaynst him by sundry Witnesses lately co? from thence doe importe more discontent to the Aduenturers heare &amp; more hazard to the Plantation then euer did any other thing yt befell that Action from the beginning. His discontent? in yt wee subscribed our letter sent unto him wth few hands, our terming him to bee but Deputy Gouernour hee dis- dayning to bee Deputy to any man, our letters to bee deliuered unto him by soe meane a man as the Cape-merchaunt wth many such like wch wee pass ouer. And briefely1 1 Written over "cheifely." wee must complayne to your Lõp of his neglecting and trans- gressing our Commission and Instructions. First hee hath made away all the Kyne belonging to the Colony and taken satisfaction for them to himselfe wheras wee gaue him express chardge in his Instructions to preserue and nourish them to the Common use except some few which wee had disposed whereof wee writt him in perticular. He hath suffered passengers mariners and others wth out restraynte to shipp moast of the Tobacko and all the Sassa- fras for themselues which by order of Courte at certayne rates agreed uppon are appropriated to the Magazine—Hee armes himselfe and other wth uniust accusations agaynst us to ouerthrow the magazine. Without which wee know assuredly yt neither the Adventurers heare nor the Plantation there can long subsist. Hee hath gotten possession and keepes back our Hyd? under pre- tence of being Admirall wch cost our ioynt stock well neare—400li—wth a greate deale of toyle and trouble before wee could obtayne them wth his obsti- nate refusall to deliver them hee hath doñ us soe greate displeasure at the returns of this ship as hee could not haue worked to haue doñ us a greater. Hee hath forbidden all trade and commerce wth the Indians but trades amongs[t] them wth the Summer Island Frigott and our men to his owne benefitt. Hee takes the auncient Collony men which should now bee free and our men from the Common Garden to sett them aboute his owne imployment and wth the Collonys stoare of Corne feeds his men hee proclay? noe man shall dare to buy any thing of Furr ?of the Indians? but himself as yf the Plantation and ye people there were ordayned onely to serue his turne. Theese and to many like Errours of his are layde to his chardge for wch the Adventurers heare will noe ways bee satisfyd wth out his personall appearance to make his Aunsweare and they are hardly restrayned notwth standing the Kinges [farr of in?] progress from going to the Court to make there Complaynte and to procure his Mats commaund to fech him home and therefore wee pray yr Lordp for the avoyding of farther scandall and slaunder to the Gouerment of our Plantation yt you will cause him to bee shipped home in this ship the William and Thomas to satisfy the Adventurers by aunswearing such things as shall be layde to his chardge and for yt wee suppose there will bee found many misdemeanours of his for wch hee must make satisfaction to the Compagny wee pray your Lorpt to ceaze upon such goods of his as Tobacko and Furrs wherof it is reported hee hath gotten together a greate stoare to the Collonies preiudice and to sende them to us to bee in deposite till all matters bee satisfyd and yt yr Lop: would bee pleased to take back agayne thos Kyne and Bullocks wch by his unlawfull sale are dispersed heare and there and yt they may bee brought together agayne to the Collonies use and to such others of the Hundreds as the Generall Courte by yr Lopps consent did order and appoynt. Your Lõps very assured to doe yu service Sr Thomas Smith Sr Ihon Dauers Sr Ihon Wolstenholme Robert Ihonson [30] London 23 of August 1618 After wch Sr Edwin Sandys appealed to the iudgement of the Court whither these charges against Captaine Argall had their originall from him or from other who are nowe reputed to be his best freind? True it twas that one thinge fell out in his yeare, namely the sendinge out of Captaine Argalls Shippe both victualled and manned from the Colony a rovinge to the West Indies whereof complainte beinge made from the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia as of an Act that might worke their vtter ruine and extirpa?on, he could do no lesse then giue notice thereof according to his oath to the Lords of his Mats priuy Counsell wherein he did nothing otherwise then by the direc?on of the Counsell and Companie and with as much modera?on as the cause could possiblie beare. After wch delibera?on ?declara?on? made by Sr Edwin Sandys it was generally pressed by the Companie, That whereas the last Quarter Court appointed a select Co?ittee to call Captain Argall to an Account, for the losses wch the Companie and Colony haue sustayned by his mis- imployinge, and convertinge to his owne vse their Tenant? and Ser- vant? their Cattle and Corne and other good? and yearely proffitt? in the time of his gouerment to his owne excessiue gaine and lucre, and to the great deteriment of the Companie and almost distruc?on of the Planta?on: That for asmuch as the said Co?ittee hath hetherto donn nothinge in that matter, they were earnestly entreated by this Court to proceed therein with all expedi?on and diligence and to make report of their proceeding? to the next Court if it be possible or el? as soone after as they can with any conveniency that further order may be taken therein at the Quarter Court followinge. It beinge moued to knowe the pleasure of the Court for sale of the Tobacco brought home in the George, in respect the market? here were but bad for ventinge Tobacco except at a very lowe price: It was aduised (that vnlesse it could be sold for 4s ?li) to forbeare the Sale both of the Companies Tobacco, and of the Magazine some fewe dayes longer vntill it might be knowne whither the intended Contract with his Matie did proceed or not. A mo?on beinge made for auditinge of mr Peirs Account? and for decid- ing some differences between mr Leate and mr Morris Abbott about the Tobacco that mr Leate bought of the Companie for 2s 3d the pound The Court appointed mr Nich: ffarrar Dpt. mr Bennett. mr Io: ffarrar. mr Palmer. mr Bull. mr Boothby. mr Essington. mr Caswell. mr Kightley. mr Mellinge. mr Sheppard. mr Meuerell. or any fower of them to meet when mr Deputy shall appointe.

This Court beinge purposely called to be made acquainted howe farr the Co?ittee (appointed by the former Court) had proceeded in their Treaty with the right Honoble the Lord High Treasuror of England touching a Contract to be made with his Matie by the Virginia and the Su?er Iland? Companies for the sole Importation of Tobacco, Sr Edwin Sandys beinge entreated by my Lo: of Southampton to make the rela?on signified vnto the Court that aforesaid Co?ittee after mature delibera?on had vpon the premisses thought fitt to offer to his lp: certaine Propositions touchinge this intended Contract. wch Propositions accordinge to his lps desire were sett downe in writinge and the same were nowe also read in Court beinge here ensuinge. Propositions from the Compagny of Virginia and the Summer Islands offered to the Consideration of the Lord High Tresuror of England touching a Con- tract to bee made wth his Maty for ye sole Importation of Tobacko. 1.That the Compagny haue the sole1 1 The caption and preceding words of this document are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. importa?on of Tobacco into the Realmes of England and Ireland. 2.That his Matie by Proclama?on inhibite all others vnder paine of confisca?on of their Tobacco and his Mats high displeasure. 3.That likewise the plantinge of Tobacco in England and Ireland be forbid- den by the same proclama?on vnder a grieuous penalty. 4.In considera?on whereof as also for that the Companies shalbe discharged from all ?any? other paymente? due to his Matie or to any other persons by graunt from him exceptinge onely the auncient custome sett downe in ye printed booke of rat? (of 6d ?li for roll Tobacco and 4d the for leafe) the Com- panies shall pay vnto his Matie ye proffitt of a full fourth part of all ye Tobacco that shalbe yearely imported and vented in either of these two Realmes duringe the said Contract and if the said fourth part shall not amount to the full value of 20000li by the yeare to his Matie aboue all charges and deduc?on [32] in yt case the Companies shall make addi?on out of their said Tobacco in such quantitie as to make vp the said 20000li prouided that the said addi?on yealded vnto by ye Companies in case aforesaid do at no time exceed a full Third part of the entire yearely value of their said Tobacco. 5.And Touchinge the said Custome their desire is that his lp: would be pleased that it might be reduced vnto a certen Su? beinge the medi? of these seauen yeares last past, of wch so?e the Companie to paye the ratable part to their propor?on of Tobacco and his Matie the like ratable part to his. 6.That the Tobacco to be brought in be consigned all into one hand vizt of such officers as the said Companies shall appointe, And the said Companies haue the sole managinge of the said sale of Tobacco yealdinge vnto his Matie a true and perfect Account thereof and payinge the proffitt wch shall growe due vnto his Matie vnto such as the Lo: Treasuror shall appointe to receaue the same. 7.That all charges aswell for the fraight and carriage as for all other thing? incident to the orderinge and Disposinge and sale of the said Tobacco be Defalked and allowed in ye said Account? proporconably out of his Mats and out of the Companies part?. 8.That his lp: be pleased to take a strict course for the preventinge of all vndue bringing in of Tobacco by other meanes. 9.That his lp: be likewise pleased for the present to take order for the pre- uentinge of ye bringing in of any Spanish Tobacco more then the allowance already sett. 10.That all confisca?on and other penaltys vpon this Contract be diuided into three part? the one part to his Mats vse, the other to the Companies and the third to the Informer. 11.That this Contract begin at Mic?as next and continue for seauen yeares. 12.That this graunt intended be for all other matters tendinge to this buis- sines drawne in most benificiall sort for ye Companies and for the aduancement of the Planta?on, his Mats proffitt as aforesaid reserued. 13.That if any confisca?on of Tobacco shall happen between this and Mic?as next the same may be for the vses aforesaid wch if it cannot be granted that yet at least wise the Tobacco so confiscated may be sent out of the Realme to be sold elswhere and not to cloye these Kingdomes therewith wch would tend aswell to ye Da?age of his Maty as of ye Companies. 14.That ?in? his Mats said Proclama?on there may be inserted a lymita?on of ye price of Tobacco aswell for the said Companies as for ye Retaylors so that the Companies shall sell no Tobacco at aboue 8s the pound nor the Retaylors at aboue 10s and so ratably for lesser quantities, single pipefulls of Tobacco onely excepted. 15.Lastly the Companies humbly beseech his lp: to be a meanes that his graceous Matie may be more truely informed of their present proceedings in this his Mats seruice for ye benifitt &amp; aduancemt of these his royall Planta?ons hauinge found to their exceedinge great greife and discouragemt yt the malign- ers of them and their Ac?ons, haue much preuayled against them by most vntrue suggestions, that so standinge right in his Mats fauor they may with more efect continue in their toylesome cares and endeauors for the setting forward of these noble works and in all other seruices that may be acceptable to his Matie. In aunsweare wherevnto his lp: deliuered three exceptions taken against them. The first was that the offer of a fourth part by the Companies with a conditionall addition might be altered into an absolute graunt of a third. Secondly that there be no discharge of the Patent of garbelinge. Thirdly that the Kinge might not be charged with any fraight. Vnto wch seuerall exceptions the Committee had framed an Answeare and had also made an Addi?on of certaine clauses assented vnto to be inserted in the Contract hauinge bin omitted in the first Propositions. wch Answr to the Exceptions and those other Additions were here like- wise read, and are these ensuinge. [33] The Answeare of the Co?ittees to certen exceptions taken on the Lord Treas- urors behalfe to the Proposicons of the Companies touchinge the sole Impor- tation of Tobacco. First his lp: requires that the offer of a fourth part with some condi- conall addition be altered into an absolute graunt of a third parte. The Co?ittees make answeare that the Generalities of the Companies do con- ceaue the offer of a fourth part with the condi?on of enlargement annexed, to haue haue bin so large, as that it would haue been accepted: Notwithstand- inge the Comittees will doe their best endeauors to drawe them by ?swasion to yeald to this Demaund of a Third part, So that there be no further burdens laid vpon them: wch if there should be they think it not possible to bringe the Companies to yeald vnto it. Secondly it is required by his lp that there be no discharge of the Patent of Garbellinge. The Co?ittees answeare that they are crediblie informed that the Patent for Garbellinge hath not hitherto taken effect vpon any man as beinge question- able, first whither Tobacco be garbellable at all, and secondly whither the propor?on of a groat vpon the pound be not excessive, consideringe that some Tobacco is daylie sold for litle aboue that value (all duties discharged) And in perticular for themselues the Companies alledge that by their precedent Letters Patent? graunted from his Matie they stand free and discharged from all Taxes besid? the Customes: Notwithstandinge the Co?ittees conceaue, that if his lp: would be pleased, that in this Contract and Grant intended the Companies might be clearely dicharged from all clayme of that Patent: It would be a great inducement to the Companies to yeald to that third part desired: Whereas contrariwise if they should conceaue that besid? that Third part and the old custome expressed in the printed booke of Rat? (wch they yeald to paye for their two Third?) they shalbe also charged with this grote for garblinge it would amount in the whole to a full moytie of their good?. Thirdly his lp: doth not hold it reasonable that the Kinge should be charged with any fraight considering that his right to the third doth growe vpon the arriuall of the same within these his Kingdomes But his Lp: is well pleased that in all other charges after the said arriuall the Kinge beare his part accordinge to his proportion of a third. The Comittees answeare that they will do their best endeauor to ?swade the Companies to rest satisfied herewith. Addition of certen clauses assented vnto to be inserted in the said Con- tract hauing bin omitted in the first Propositions. That there be a Clause inserted for restraint of bringinge in Spanish Tobacco aboue 60000 waight. That there be likewise inserted in the Contract a Graunt or Couenant from his Matie against the grauntinge of Licenses to Retaylors of Tobacco: But that the Sale thereof may remaine free as hitherto it hath donne. The ratinge of the prices of Tobacco aswell for the Marchant as the Retayler, his lp: is pleased to leaue to be sett downe by the Companies vpon full debate of all reasons thereto incident. Whereas they haue receaued from his lp: the medi? of the quantity of Tobacco brought in these seauen last yeares endinge in Mic?as i62i amountinge to 1420854/7. The Co?ittees desire that by a newe examina?on it may be more perticularly sett downe howe much thereof was roll Tobacco and howe much was leafe because of the different customers and that the whole may be reduced into a certaine So?e of money: of wch Some one Third to be paid by the Kinge and two Third? by the Companie and the Customers to make noe further demaund. [34] Hee further signified that since that time the Comittee had receaued his Lps: pleasure vpon a newe Proposition vizt that for these two next yeares either the Companie should be bounde to bringe in 60000 waight of Spanish Tobacco or otherwise permitt 40000 waight to be brought in by some other. wch newe Proposition appearinge verie greivous vnto the Co?ittees, and such as did crosse their originall purpose, they made replye with eight reasons against it wch they also caused to be deliuered ?in writ- inge? to his lp: being these ensuinge. The Comittees haue lately reaueed his lp: pleasure vpon a newe Propo- sition not formerly mentioned vizt That for these two next yeares either the Companie should be bound to bringe in 60000 weight of Spanish Tobacco, or in case of their vnwillingnes to be thereto tyed they should be content that some other might bringe in 40000 weight of Tobacco: whereof his Matie to haue likewise the profitts of one Third. The Co?ittees make Answeare that they conceaue that the beare publishinge of this Proposi?on would breed in both the Companies so great aversnes, that they would be vncapeable of that perswasion wch they nowe trust may pre- vayle to induce them to yeald to the former point? in question. The reasons which moue the Comittees to be of this opinion are these ensuinge. 1.They say that the example of bindinge men to bringe in any forraigne Comodities, whereof there is is sufficient growinge within the Kings owne Dominions will seeme verie strange, and such as they suppose hath not bin heard of in any part of the world. 2.They say that the former Patentees for the sole Importa?on were free from this Bond. 3.They conceaue that this propor?on doth ouerthrowe the former Contract in the most materiall part? thereof, especially if it should be yealded that any other besid? the Companies should haue liberty to bringe in any Spanish Tobacco. 4.They leaue it to his ?ps: graue considera?on whither the forbiddinge to plant Tobacco in England: and the co?aundinge thereof to be brought in from a forraigne Country, beinge conceaued to haue bin a chiefe cause of the want of money in this Realme would not be greivous to the English Subiect, and greatly preiudiciall to the Patentees in their reputa?on. They saye that the propor?on men?oned in the Proposition of 60000 waight seemeth verie excessiue, and more then was brought in, in diuers of the said seauen yeares, when there was no restrainte at all for bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco. They conceaue that this Proposition may in effect clearely crosse the two mayne ends proposed to this Contract, namely the proffitt of his Matie and the benifitt of the Plantations: seeinge that it is generally knowne and confessed, that there hath bin in these later yeares as much Tobacco vnduely brought in without payinge of Custome, as that wch hath bin orderly brought in by the Marchant wch if it hath heretofore bin 12d out of the Kings waye will nowe vpon this Contract ?will? be neare ten times as much, and the onely waye to auoyde that fraude and mischiefe, is the certaine discerning of the seuerall kind? of Tobacco, wherein there can be no errorr: Whereas contrariwise vnder the coulor of Spanish Tobacco, it wilbe vnpossible to avoide the stealinge in of ten times as much, whereof the former Patentees haue had deare experi- ence, So that if his Matie should gaine by that Proposition some thousand of pound? one way, he should ruñ hazard of loosinge twice as much by wrong- inge the great Contract, and this reason is of like force touchinge the benifitt of the Plantacons wch together with his Mats proffitt must stand and fall growe and diminish. [35] They saye that the bringinge in of so great propor?on of the best Spanish Tobacco must abase vtterly the price of the Tobacco of both the Plantations whereby the disproffitt aswell to his Matie as the Companie may proue greater then the benifitt conceaued by this newe Proposition. And touchinge the Plantations, it appeareth most manifestly by the experience of this yeare that the bringinge in of that quantitie of 60000 waight hath kept downe the Virginia and Su?er Ilands Tobacco at the same rate as formerly: So that by the admittinge of this Proposition the Plantations should depart with one Third of their Tobacco without any retribu?on in the price as was at first proposed. Lastly the Committees saye that beinge left at liberty accordinge to the former Propositions if they shall finde hereafter by reason or experience that the bringinge in some Spanish Tobacco may proue a matter of benifitt to the Kinge and Companie they shall haue great reason to apply themselues there- vnto within the lymitt? prescribed and with better caution then could be obserued if they should admitt of any Partners. Howbeit it beinge afterward made euident vnto them and therevpon much vrged that the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco for a certaine time was of that importance as might not be omitted. Herevpon the Co?ittee takinge into ?their? serious considera?on howe avayleable it wilbe vnto both the Plantations that his Mats proffitt goe hand in hand with the Companies, and on the other side considering that if this Contract did not proceed a worse accident might befall, they applyed their endeauors to the best of their vnderstandinge to sett downe some meanes so to qualifie the said newe Proposition, as might be least preiudiciall to the Planta?ons: wch thought fitt to restraine to these three lymita?ons: ffirst that the Couenant for bring- inge in of Spanish Tobacco be lymitted to two yeares and no longer: Secondly that the quantitie be reduced to these propor?ons, namely not to exceed 60000 waight nor to be lesse then 40000: Thirdly that it be with this condi?on that the Spanyard? do not raise the custome or other burdens vpon it or the present price that nowe it is sold for at in Spaine and that the markett? of Tobacco in Spayne be in all respectscripte; as free as formerly they haue bin; or otherwise the said Cou- enant for bringinge of Spanish Tobacco to to be void and discharged. Hee also signified that in reguard this newe Proposition had appear- ance of damage and danger both to the Companies and Plantations, they therefore thought fitt to extend the whole Contract but to three yeares in certaine and afterwards for fower yeares more, yet so as the Companies to be at liberty to dissolue this Contract vpon a yeares warninge giuen either at the end of the second yeare or any yeare after. All wch Proceeding? of the Co?ittees beinge thus related and read and the Court duely waighinge them, acknowledged the Co?ittee had proceeded herein with as much care wisdome and circumspection as possibly they could desire and themselues much bound to the honoble Lords and others the Co?ittee for the extraordinary paynes they had taken in this buissines. And because it appeared there were nowe some thing? propounded wch the Company neuer heard before as namely the bringinge in of a certaine quantity of Spanish Tobacco and the yealdinge of a Third part thereof to the Kinge, they desired time till the next Court to consider thereof as also of the best meanes of preventinge the stealinge of any more then the propor?on lymited, if that of necessity must be yealded vnto.

My Lord of Southampton signified vnto the Companie that he held it fitt accordinge to their vsuall manner (before they did proceed to a newe matter) to read that wch had bin formerly donne. And because there had happened a mettinge of the Court on the 19th of Iune between the last Court and a Court held the fift of the same Moneth, wherein the buissines nowe in hand was first proposed: It was therefore agreed that the said middle Court held on the 19th of Iune wherein other matters were treated of (and not this Contract intended) should be put of to be read on Wedensday beinge the next Quarter Court and the rather because in that Court of the 19th of Iune are many waightie matters wch highly concerned the Company, and most fitt for the knowledge of that great Quarter Court touchinge the said Contract wch two Court? beinge read together, with the whole proceeding? of ye Co?ittee touchinge the said Contract to be made with his Matie by the Companies for Virginia and the Su?er Ilands for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco: After some pause therevpon Sr Edwin Sandys who had bin desired to make report of the whole pro- ceeding?, tooke occasion to acquaint the Companie that the Co?ittee havinge receaued a newe Proposi?on from the Lo: Treasuror for the bringinge in of 60000 waight of Spanish Tobacco, or otherwise to permitt 40000 waight to be brought in by some other, they had opposed it with the eight reasons wch were read against it, but there appearinge vnto them a necessity of yealdinge therevnto or other- wise [37] to breake the bargaine §in hand§ with the Kinge: The Comittee laboured in this extreamity to qualifie the said Proposition by restrayninge it to the three lymita?ons wch they had heard likewise read: And lastly they thought fitt that forasmuch as this newe Proposi?on had appearance of damage and danger both to the Com- panies and the Planta?ons they thought meete to lymitt the whole Contract to three yeares in certaine, and afterward? for fower yeares more, yet so as the Companies §to§ be at liberty to dissolue this Con- tract vpon a yeares warninge giuen, at the end either of the second yeare, or any yeare after, wch lymita?on though it had not yet bin imparted to my Lo: Treasuror, yet the party appointed to treat with them herein, made no great doubt but that it might be graunted. But touchinge the Patent of Garbellinge, wch the Co?ittee desired to be discharged of, The Lo: Treasuror said it was out of his power to recall what his Matie had alreadie graunted vnder his great Seale to certaine priuate gentlemen: wth whome notwithstandinge he made no question they might compound vpon reasonable condi?ons, or otherwise they had liberty to stand vpon the alledged priuiledge of their Patent and benifitt of the co?on lawe (if they conceaued that might help them) for his lp: herevpon verie noblie professed he did vrge this present Contract no further, then as it might well stand with the future good of §both§ the Plantations. Whervpon the matter beinge taken into debate by the Companies, Some conceaued, that as it would be greivous vnto the Aduenturers so would it be vnto the Planters in Virginia, nor could it well stand with the safety of the Plantation, if the Planters vpon halfe proffitt? be forced to paye also a third part of their Tobacco to the Kinge: But it was answeared by reason they were to paye the Kinge in the Specie of Tobacco and not in money and for all other duties to paye only the medi? of the Custome (if they might therewithall be discharged of the matter of Garbellinge) it was verie probable (the buissines beinge duly managed) they should not be in worse case then they were before: Wherevpon some moued that the contract with his Matie might be condi?onall with proffer of a fourth part for the present vntill they might be eased of their Couenant for bringinge in Spanish Tobacco and also quitt of the said Patent of Garbellinge: And others moued that a Clause in this Contract might be inserted to free them from it, but it was answeared that a Precedent Patent could not be infringed by any after Graunt nor was it held fitt so much as to ques- tion the ?uiledge of their owne Patent wch was sufficient against it. After wch debate with some other allega?ons tendinge to impugne the said Contract, and the Lord? that were present desired that the buis- sines might be proceeded within an orderly fashion, and brought one waye or other to a certaine Conclusion and resolu?on; Sr Edwin Sandys herevpon moued that for a more orderly proceedinge herein, the whole bussines might be reduced to certaine heades, and that each of those heades might be throughly debated of, and the Court to passe their iudgement seuerally vpon each, and [38] finally in con- clusion vpon the whole bargaine of the Contract: And he said that he had obserued in the reasons and Allega?ons, wch had bin hetherto made, that some of them did directly impugne the Contract or some branch thereof, and some other did moue questions onely of certaine difficulties that seemed to depend vpon the orderinge and managinge of this buissines, wch difficulties seemed not to be of that importance as to disharten men from it if the Contract it selfe were asented vnto: And therefore to proceed with the Contract it selfe, he first acquainted the Companie that this matter of contractinge for the sole Importation of Tobacco ?had? moued originally from an offer made for the same, by the then Gouernor and Deputy of the Com- panie for the Su?er Ilands who had bin also Treasuror and Deputy for this Company as was openly deliuered at the Counsell Bourd in presence of himselfe and many others of the Companie nowe in Court Wherevpon it was conceaued by reason of the quality of the persons the offer had moued from the two Companies; wch at the same time was absolutely denied and disavowed by the Members of both Com- panies then attendinge their ?ps. But the first mouer of this Contract for the sole Importa?on cominge to no higher an offer then of 10000li Rent by the yeare, It was vndertaken by others, namely Sr Thomas Roe and his Associat? at a much greater rent, who for the raisinge thereof, besides their Patent of Contract for sole Importa?on procured also a Proclamation from his Matie, straightly inhibitinge all others to bringe in any Tobacco into this Realme without the Patentees license, wch was the cause of the Companies then attendinge their ?ps. Where- vpon a graceous Referrence from his Matie they obtained liberty not- withstanding the said Proclamation to bringe in 55000 wtt from the two plantations whereof the Companie for Virginia did bestowe their whole part vpon the other Companie, Sr Thomas Roes yeare beinge ended, the same Contract hath bin vndertaken this yeare by mr Iacobe, though not at the same rent who contrariwise hath procured (as he hath bin informed,) a co?aundment to the Companie to bringe in all their Tobacco, wch it seemed was to the no greater content of the Com- panies, then the first restrainte from bringinge in any at all without lycense: These troubles as they all knewe had befalne the Company by reason of those Contract? for sole Importa?on, and that not longe after in thankefullnes to his Matie for prohibitinge the plantinge of Tobacco in this Realme (wch was donne without any suite from the Companies) The Companie of Virginia had yealded for 5 yeares to double their custome. But the Lord Treasuror herevpon obseruinge what greiuous molesta- ?ons the Companies haue sustained from time to time in their pro- ceedings by reason the said Contract was managed by others, did therefore nowe make offer thereof, to the Companies, that if they so liked, and should finde it to be for the good of their said Companies and the Plantations they might nowe contract with his Matie for the sole Importa?on of all Tobacco whatsoeuer: So that it was nowe to be considered whither they thinke it more fitt for them then any other to entertaine this Contract with his Matie wch he said was the first pointe to be resolued on in this bussines. After longe pause and much dispute, it was desired at length it might be put to the question wch was proposed in this manner. [39] Whither the Companies of Virginia and Su?er Ilands thought fitt to entertaine this contract with his Matie for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco vpon such condi?ons as should be agreed on or suffer the same to be entertayned againe by some other: Herevnto the Court generally signified their wilingnes and consent to entertaine the said Bargaine. The second question proposed by Sr Edwin Sandys to be considered of, was at what rate this Contract should be concluded vpon, there hauing bin a fourth part of the Tobacco offered to his Matie wch would not be accepted. In declara?on whereof Sr Edwin Sandys further signified, that my lo: Treasurors speach was that seeinge his Matie proffitt was to be raised onely by Sale of Tobacco and not in certainty of money, he was so to prouide, That the Kinge his Mr were noe looser by this bargaine: to prevent wch hee hauinge duely calculated the medium of Tobacco that haue bin brought in the last seauen yeares and considered of all circumstances incident herevnto, he said he could demaund no lesse then a Third part of the Tobacco for his Matie. Sr Edwin Sandys further signified that the Comittee entringe into considera?on of this pointe founde by the rat? that the Tobacco is nowe sold at that they paid alreadie litle lesse then a Third parte, all charg? considered. As for the custome insisted vpon for the Kinge, It was presumed the price of Tobacco would heareby be so much aduanced as would giue the Companie a convenient retribu?on. The Co?ittee further informed the Companie that my Lo: Treasuror said that if the Companie shall at any time desire to transporte the Tobacco wch they cannot vent here at home into any forraigne part? it shalbe free alwayes from Custome. It was further intimated, that it was intended that the King? part of the Tobacco and the Companies shalbe sold together and not deuided till the moneys therevpon be raised. As for the intricacy wch was supposed would happen in the sale thereof, in reguard of the different goodnes of the Tobacco (whereby it was conceaued men would be the more willinge careles in the makinge and curinge thereof, if once they vnderstand it shalbe sold confusedly together) Answeare was made it should be sorted and valued accord- inge to the goodnes: Wherevpon it being agreed to put it to the question whither the Companies did not thinke it better to contract for the sole Importa?on and sale of Tobacco and yeald a full third part thereof to the Kinge ouer and aboue their part? of auncient custome rather then breake the bargaine with his Matie The whole Court did generally agree to giue a Third. [40] The third question offered to their considera?on by Sr Edwin Sandys was touchinge the newe Proposition of bringinge in a quantitie of Spanish Tobacco, against wch Sr Edwin Sandys signified the eight reasons lately read were opposed beinge conceaued it would in effect cleare crosse the two mayne endes proposed to this Contract namely his Mats proffitt and the benifitt of the Plantations But his Iop return- inge answeare that this was a matter of so great importance and con- sequence as could not be dispenced with, The Comittees herevpon did endeauor to qualifie it with such limita?ons as had bin before recited from wch as they had bin also since informed his lp: did not dissent. This pointe beinge a longe time debated by the Companie, a question was moued whither in case the 40000 wtt proposed beinge transported into any other forraigne part? and not into England would be allowed the Kinge havinge his Third duely paid him. It was conceaued it must first be imported otherwise it would not sat- isfie, but yet if then it could not be here vented there was noe doubt, but they might freely export it to the best Markett?, Some were also of opinion that the Kinge would gaine but litle by the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco, in reguard so much the more of the Companies Tobacco must be transported elswhere for want of Sale, At length at the request of the Companie it was put to the question; namely whither the Companies did not thinke it best for them to vndergoe this condi?on of bringinge in yearely 40000 wtt of Spanish Tobacco for the two next yeares onely with those other qualifica?ons, wch had bin formerly read rather then to breake the Contract intended with the Kinge: The Court did generally declare themselues willing to vnder- take it: Prouided that casuality at Sea be excepted, and those other condi?ons graunted that haue bin alledged. The next question offered by Sr Edwin Sandys to their considera?on, touchinge the addi?on of charges, namely the matter of Garbellinge and fraight: Touchinge the first it was alledged by some of the Com- panie, that it appeared the Companies had two string? to their Bowe, namely the benifitt of the co?on Lawe, and the power of the Kings Letters Patents formerly graunted to them. It was also informed by other of the Company that this Patent of Garbelling beinge questioned by the lower howse at the last meetinge of Parliament was adiudged by all the Lawyers of that howse to be a greiuance both in the Creation and (if euer it proceeded so farr) much worse in the execu?on. Wherevpon it beinge put to the question whither the Companies thought it not fitt to proceed in this Contract and leaue the matter of Garbelling in the State it is rather then otherwise to desist: The Court generally agreed to leaue it so, and to insist vpon the validity of their owne Patent and the benifitt of the co?on lawe if need be. [41] The last question where it was alledged by Sr Edwin Sandys that the Lo Treasuror consented that the Kinge should beare his Third parte of all other charges after the arriuall of the Tobacco here, at wch time his interest vnto that Third did begin, but not to looke backe to any charges preceedent. This pointe beinge throughly debated and with much opposi?on, The Companie at length desired it might be put to the question: wch was proposed after this manner: Whither they thought it not better to paye the whole fraight of the Tobacco, That is to Saye, aswell for the Kings Third part as their owne, rather then to breake the bargaine with his Matie: the Company by plurality of voices consented to paye the whole fraight. Sr Edwin Sandys likewise moued that for auoydinge difference or questions that might arise on the King? part about the appointinge of Officers and allowances for their Salaries and for other charges about this buissines, that it might be added to the rest of the Articles, that the Companie may haue power to choose their said Officers, and that their Salaries and all other charges be rated and sett downe by them in their generall Court? and that vpon their Account the entire charges be defalked and allowed. These buissinesses beinge thus ordered the last thinge taken into con- sidera?on was the reducinge of the whole Contract by writinge into Articles to be presented to the Lord Treasuror the next daye, wch Articles beinge assented vnto by his lp: are to be offered to the iudge- ment of the Quarter Court held on Wednesday next to be finally con- cluded and confirmed. Wherevpon the Court entreated Sr Edwin Sandys to take the paines to drawe vp the said Articles, and beinge perfected the Court humbly entreated the Ea: of Southampton together with Sr Edwin Sandys to repaire to the Lord Treasuror some time to morrowe about the premisses. A mo?on was made for diuers Patent? to be made readie against the Quarter Court, for wch order was giuen for the drawinge of them: And further ordered that the Patent? and some other buissinesses should be read and ordered by the morning? Court that daye. [42]</field>

The Court gaue order that a Receipt should be sealed for 47li 16s wch the gentlemen and marriners had giuen to the East India Companie to be imployed in layinge the founda?on of a Church in Virginia. The Court thought fitt to make Capt: Martin Prin (the Captaine of the Royall Iames) a freeman of the Companie and to giue him two shares of land in reguard of the large contribu?on wch the gentlemen and Marriners of that Shippe had giuen toward? good work? in Vir- ginia whereof he was an especiall furtherer. The Court thought fitt likewise to make mr Thomas Kerridge, (the Co?aunder of the East India ffleet that last came home) a freeman and to giue him two shares of land in the same reguard. The Court vnderstandinge that mr Robert Carles beinge a man that had liued Twenty yeares in the West Indies and 16: yeares in the East Indies beinge likewise verie skillfull in orderinge curinge and plantinge of Rice Cotten-woole Sugar-Canes, Indico, Cassado, Root?, &amp;c, of some whereof he had written a Treatise and besid? was in part determined to goe himselfe to Virginia: It was thought fitt to bestowe on him one share of land, old Aduenture and to make him a ffreeman. The Court thought fitt also to make mr Swayne (Mr of the Hart that last came ?home? from the East Indies) a freeman and to giue him one share of land. The Court thought fitt likewise to make mr Sam: Seaward (of Oxford Bachelor of Diuinity) a ffreeman, he in the rehersall sermon havinge manifested a great zeale to the Plantation. The Court likewise thought fitt to make mr Launce a ffreeman vnder- standing that he was a continuall remembrancer of the Plantation in his Prayers. [43] The Court thought fitt to bestowe a freedome vpon mr Pemberton a Minister of God? word, intendinge forthwith to goe to Virginia and there to imploye himselfe for the convertinge of the Infidell?. Mrs Mary Tue Daughter of Hugh Crouch beinge the heire and Execu- trix of Leiutenant ?Richard?

There was read a Grant of 18 Shares of land of old Aduenture to Capt Dan: Tucker, for three whereof he paid in ready money §after§ 12li 10s the other fifteen were giuen him for his good seruice by an order of a Quarter Court.

The Lo: Cauendish mr Caswell mr Gibbs mr Smith &amp; mr Wrote The two Deputies are earnestly desired by the Court to treat with the Citty about the Children that are to be sent this yeare to Virginia and to make the best bargaine for them they can. [44] The Court haue likewise thought fitt that mr Pountice formerly ap- pointed Vice admirall in Virginia haue 6 of the said Children sent him this yeare to be placed vpon the Landes belonginge to his said office and 6: the next yeare. The placeinge and entertainement of mr Copland in Virginia being referred by the former Court to the considera?on of a Co?ittee they hauinge accordingly aduised about it did nowe make report of what they had donne therein as followeth (vizt). 1ffirst they thought fitt that he be made Rector of the intended Col- ledge in Virginia for the conversion of the Infidell? and to haue the pastorall charge of the Colledge Tenant? about him. 2In reguard of his Rectorshippe to haue the Tenth part of the proffitt? due to the Colledge out of their land? and arisinge from the labors of their Tenant?. 3In reguard of his pastorall charge to haue a personage there erected, according to their generall order for parsonages. And for that it was nowe further moued that he might be admitted of the Counsell there, it was referred to the former Co?ittee to consider thereof and of some other thing? propounded for his better acco?o- da?on there. Vpon mo?on that the Virginia Companie would please to make the Right Honoble the Lo: Marquesse Hamilton free of this Companie and of the Counsell in reguard of his Noble affec?on to this Planta- ?on; The Court most gladly assented therevnto.

After the readinge of the Quarter Court in May last there was read the Court of the 19th of Iune followinge beinge put of till this Court to be read, wherein amonge other thing? of note were read diuers peti?ons that had bin preferred to his Matie against the Virginia Companie, as namely that of Capt: Martin wherein he complayned that the Virginia Company denyed him the frui?on of those priui- ledges they had graunted vnto him in his Patent: Vnto wch complaint [46] the Companie had formerly made their Answeare by writing: The second peti?on was by Capt: Martin and Capt: Hazell together, who intituled his Matie to a large parte of Virginia contayninge 80 miles in circuite sett out by Sr Thomas Dale as the Kings fforrest wherevnto the Company had also giuen their Answeare to Sr Christo: Perkins (vnto whome his Matie had referred these peti?ons) as like- wise had answeared two other peti?ons in the name of one Dixon and Wm Kempe: Also another Peti?on was exhibited by Captaine Baylie in the name of Captaine So?ers wherein he had entituled the Kinge to the Sumer Ilands and to 12000li of Ambergreece wherevnto they had likewise made their Answeare, as may appeare by the said Court. After this vpon occasion of a peti?on exhibited to the said Court by Elizabeth Smalley Widdowe for deliuery of a fower oxen shee pre- tend? vnto, in Virginia, There was related the proceeding? of the said Widdowe Smalley against Captaine Argall and the cause of her Retracta?on of what shee had formerly complained of to the Kinge in her peti?on against him, confessinge freely that the said Capt Argall caused that Retracta?on to be made at the Dors Commons refusinge to sett ouer her Husbands Executorshippe vnto her vntill Shee had first sett her hand and Seale to that writinge: The matter whereof (shee said) Shee did not well vnderstand; Contrariwise shee iustified her former complaint made to the Kinge against Captaine Argall, protestinge shee was by noe other meanes moued therevnto but by the wrong? he had donn her and that the peti?on was drawne by a freind of hers at her request dwellinge in Tower streete. Herevpon Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to declare howe vnworth- ily Captaine Argall had conceaued a suspi?on against him as well touching the said Widdowe Smalley (as if he had incited her to this complaint against him,) as also touchinge some former proceeding? held against the said Capt: Argall for depreda?on of the Colony in the time of his beinge Deputy Gouernor. Whereas Sr Edwin Sandys declared that at the time of his cominge to be Treasuror he founde the same complaint? made against Captaine Argall by Sr Tho: Smith and Alderman Iohnson then Treasuror and Deputy as may appeare by their Letters sent to the Lord De: Lawarr and Captaine Argall him- selfe charging him perticularly with these thing? wch Letters were read and entred in the said Court, whereby Sr Edwin Sandys said when he came to be Treasurer he was ?tyed? both by the Duty of his place and vpon ?by vpon? his oath to bringe those matters to some heade wherewith Captaine Argall stood ?stil? charged: In wch pro- ceeding? he said he had donn nothinge but by the Counsell? direc?on and aduise. Hee further also signified that true it was that one thinge fell out in his yeare of beinge Treasuror namely the sendinge out of Captaine Argalls Shippe both victualled and manned from the Colony into the West Indies whereof complaint beinge made from the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia as of an Act that might worke their vtter [47] extirpa?on, he could no lesse then giue notice thereof accordinge to his oath to the Lords of his Mats Priuy Counsell, wherein he did nothinge otherwise then by the direc?on of the Gouernor and Counsell and with as much modera?on as the cause could possibly beare. After wch declara?on it was generally pressed by the Company that the Co?ittees appointed to call Capt: Argall to Account for the great losses wch both the Companie and Colony had sustained (seeinge they had as yet donn nothinge therein,) they would nowe proceed in that buissines with all expidi?on and dilligence that vpon their report some further course may be taken therein at the next Quarter Court. After this narra?on two other Court? were read the one of the fift of Iune, the other of the first of Iuly followinge beinge the Præparatiue Court, both wch contained a full declara?on of the proceeding? of the Co?ittees chosen out of the Virginia and the Su?er llands Company touchinge the Contract to be made with his Matie by the said Com- panies for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco nowe offered vnto them by the Lord High Treasuror of England, concerninge wch the said Co?ittees havinge consulted longe abourt it, after mature delibera?on had therevpon, offered vnto the considera?on of the Lord Treasuror certaine Propositions wch are entred verbatim in the said Court In Answeare wherevnto his lp: deliuered three exceptions vnto wch the Co?ittees had also made replie with an addi?on of certaine Clauses agreed vnto to be inserted in the Contract, havinge bin o?itted in the first Propositions: After this a newe Proposition came from his lp: concerninge the bringinge in of §60000: wtt of§ Spanish Tobacco or otherwise to ?mitt 40000 waight to be brought in by some other: wch Proposi?on for somuch as it seemed to repugne the mayne endes of their first inten?on they opposed it with eight reasons: Howbeit it beinge afterward made knowne vnto the said Co?ittees that the bring- inge in of Spanish Tobacco for a certaine time, was of that importance as might not be o?itted The Co?ittee therevpon applied their endeauors to the best of their vnderstanding? to sett downe some meanes of qualifica?on of the said newe Proposition so as it might be least preiudiciall to the Plantations: Wherevpon they thought fitt to restraine it to three lymita?ons namely that the Couenant of bring- inge in Spanish Tobacco might be lymited to two yeares and no longer, Secondly that they would be bounde to bringe in no more then 40000wtt of Spanish Tobacco: Thirdly that it be with this Prouiso that the Spanyards raise not the prices nor the custome, nor laye other burdens vpon it, and that the markett? in Spayne be open and free as formerly they haue bin. And in reguard of the appearance of Damadge and danger that might ensue to the Plantations by this newe Proposition the Co?ittees thought fitt likewise, that the whole Contract should be extended, but to three yeares in certaine, and afterward for fower yeares more, Yet so, as the Companies to be at liberty to dissolue the Contract vpon a yeares warninge giuen at the end of the second yeare or any yeare after, All wch proceedings are at large related in the said Court of the 29th of Iune last. [48] It was also signified that this buissines was againe propunded and debated in the Præparatiue Court, and after all reasons fully heard and discussed each of the former Propositions was againe seuerally put to the question and by a generall consent of that Court approued as may appeare; At wch time the Court entreated Sr Edwin Sandys to reduce the whole Contract by writinge into Articles and to offer the same to my Lo: Treasuror, wch beinge assented vnto might afterward be referred to the iudgement of this great and generall Quarter Court to be finally concluded and confirmed. Herevpon Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to signifie that accordinge to the request of the former Court, he had drawne vp the said Articles, and after he had donne, not trustinge to his owne iudgement therein had imparted them to the Deputies of both the Companies, whoe approvinge thereof, he after deliuered them to the Lord Treasuror who havinge pervsed them tooke fower exceptions against them, the first was to these words of the fourth Article namely against the offer of a Third part of the Tobacco imported and vented whereas his lp: required a Third of all the Tobacco, ?brought out of Virginia? And said further that his Mats right and propriety to a Third did growe vpon the first arriuall of the Tobacco here the second exception was vnto the shortnes of the time lymited ?for the bringing in of Spanish Tobacco? beinge but for two yeares only wch his lp: thought too litle and therefore desired it might be enlarged to three yeares at least The Third exception was to the restrayninge of the Contract from seauen yeares to three yeares in certaine: The 4th exception was against the medium of the Custome of Ireland wch could not be graunted because the medium thereof was not as yet certainely knowne: Lastly his lp: aduised the Companie not to stand vpon their priuiledge against the Patent of Garbellinge, but to compound with the Patentees whome his lp: presumed they should finde verie rea- sonable. But Sr Edwin Sandys signified that the Lord Treasuror had since sent a more fauourable Answeare vnto the Companie touching the same exceptions, for being informed that the Tobacco in Virginia had three seuerall proprietors, as first the Tobacco belonginge to the Companie, Secondly the Tobacco belonginge to perticular Societies and Planta- ?ons, Thirdly the Tobacco belonginge to priuate men, (acquired either by purchase or by their ?sonall Aduenture) the Companie ouer the two later sort? had no power to prohibite or authority to co?and them to bringe their Tobacco hither, but were free and at liberty by their lawes and graunt? to carry their Co?odities to what markett? they please. Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys said that the Lord Treasuror desisted from this first Proposition, and did nowe require no more Tobacco to be brought in, then the Companies shall thinke fitt: but of that wch shalbe brought in the required a Third for the Kinge, and further desired that the worde Vented might be lefte out of that clause: Secondly whereas his lp: desired the two yeares of bringinge in Spanish Tobacco might be enlarged to three yeares: His lp: was contented, it should passe for two yeares onely if the Company stooke much at it; But desired that a Co?ittee might be appointed [49] to consider what sort? of Spanish Tobacco should be brought in: Thirdly whereas it was desired the Contract might continue for seauen yeares in certen, his lp: was pleased to put it to the Companies choise, either to hold this farme for seauen yeares or otherwise that it might be free aswell for his Matie as for the Companie to dissolue the bargaine at the three yeares end: Touchinge the fourth exception against the medium of the Irish Cus- tome, it was conceaued, the reason formerly alledged would giue the Companie satisfac?on. After this the Court entred into a serious considera?on and examina- ?on of the premisses and havinge duely pondered all the reasons and circumstances that were both nowe and formerly deliuered and fully debated vpon, did at length desire that they might seuerally be put to the question wch accordingly was donn after this manner vizt. ffirst whither the Companie did thinke fitt to yeald to the Lord Treas- urors Proposition by grauntinge a Third part of all the Tobacco they should thinke fitt to bringe in and to leaue out the word vented The Court generally agreed to yeald a Third and ?to? leaue out the word vented as the Lord Treasuror desired. Secondly it beinge put to the question whither the Companie would enlarge the two yeares to Three for bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco according to the Lord Treasurors Proposition, The Court by no meanes would yeald therevnto, but generally insisted vpon 2 yeares and no longer. Thirdly it was put to the question whither the Companie would ap- point a Co?ittee to consider what sort? of Spanish Tobacco should be imported accordinge to the Lo: Treasurors desire; the Court generally agreed therevnto. ffourthly whereas the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco is vpon con- di?on that the Spanyards enhaunce not the price thereof vpon the Grant of the Contract (knowinge the certaine quantitie that must be brought in by the Companies), My Lord Treasuror desired it might be so farr explained and intended that the Spanyards do not herevpon purposely and by practise endeauor to enhaunce the price of their Tobacco, wch explana?on the Court agreed should be made of the wordes touchinge that Clause. ffiftly it was put to the question whither the Companie would be tyed in this Contract for seauen yeares ?or only three yeares? in certen, and then his Matie aswell as themselues to be at liberty to dissolue the Contract: This point was much disputed ?vpon? some desiringe it might hold but 3 yeares in hope of a better bargaine at the three yeares end &amp; the rather because the time of the 6d a pound imposi?on vpon their Tobacco, would then be expired, but others feared a much harder bargaine might then be put vpon them: Wherevpon after all reasons were discussed, beinge put to the question, it was by plurality of voices agreed, that the Contract should hold for seauen yeares. [50] Sixtly it beinge put to the question whither the clause for the medium of the Irish Custome should be strooke out seinge it could not but be estimated what it might come vnto beinge a Custome newly estab- lished The Court did generally agree to haue it strooke out. Seauenthly touchinge the Patent of garbellinge, the Court haue agreed it shall not be so much as named in this Contract but they would stand to the Tryall of lawe for their right. Eightly whereas in the fourth Article instead of the word vented they had put in Landed but did not knowe as yet whither my Lord Treas- uror would assent therevnto (but the Co?ittee hoped and promised they would do their best to perswade his lp: to admitt it) It was put to the question whither in case the Lord Treasuror should not allowe thereof the Companie did thinke it fitt to breake this intended bar- gaine with the Kinge, Herevpon the Court resolued generally that the putting out of that word Landed should not breake the bargaine with his Matie. All exceptions beinge thus cleared the Propositions were againe read all ouer, and the altera?ons also that had bin made therevpon wch beinge donne, the Ea: of Southampton praid the Companie duely to consider of them and not to spare in so waightie a buissines as this was that so nearely concerned them all to giue their best aduise and Counsell therein, it beinge free for any man to speake his minde with it or against it as his owne hart or reason should perswade him. After a longe pause for somuch as it appeared no more could be said then had bin formerly deliuered, My Lo: at length at the request of the Court put the Propositions to the question, whither they did agree and fully consent that this Contract should goe forward to be made with the Kinge for the sole importa?on of Tobacco vpon such condi?ons as had bin formerly proposed; The whole Court with one vnanimous consent signified their approba?on of it, ratifyinge and confirminge the said Bargaine, by a generall erec?on of hand? with- out contradic?on saue onely one hand held vp against it. ?Mdm the Proposi- tions agreed on concerning ye Con- tract should be here entred.?

A mo?on was made in the behalfe of Captaine Thomas Iones Captaine of the Discouery nowe imployed in Virginia for Trade and ffishinge that he might be admitted a ffreeman of this Companie in reward of the good seruice he hath there performed, The Court liked well of the mo?on and condiscended therevnto. ffrancis Carter passed ouer one share of land vnto Iohn Hitch Cittizen of London beinge the last Share of the later 40 assigned vnto him from the Right Honoble the Lady D'Lawarre. [54] Richard Bull passed ouer two shares of land in Virginia heretofore assigned vnto him by Henry Rowland Goldsmith, the one vnto Raph Bateman Cittizen and Grocer of London, the other Iohn Budge Citti- zen and Stationer of London.

A mo?on was made that forasmuch ?as? mr Truloue and his Associat? intend to proceed in their Planta?on beinge no whitt discouraged with this late Massacre of the English by the treacherous Indians are nowe settinge forth a Barke called the Truloue of London of about 46: Tuñ to Virginia they therefore desired the honoble fauor of this Court to graunt them a Co?ission for ?the? said Shippe and Voyadge wch the Court agreed vnto.

Mr Barkham presented to this Court a Graunt of certaine Land? passed vnto him by Sr Geo: Yeardley vnder the Seale of the Colony vpon condi?on that he compounded for the same with Opachankano and procured a confirma?on thereof from the Companie here within two dayes ?yeares? after the said Graunt for wch confirma?on he nowe peti?ons the Court. Vpon wch occasion it was taken into considera?on howe farr forth the Gouernor of Virginia by a Charter heretofore graunted vnto him by the Companie might graunt land? in Virginia, and it was resolued directly that by the Kings Letters Patents no other but the Companie here and that in a Quarter Court onely had power to dispose of land in Virginia neither had they liberty thereby to transmitt [55] that power from themselues to any other, And as for the Clause wch they had graunted in their said Charter vnto the Gouernor of Virginia touchinge the disposinge of land, it did only intend to giue him power as a Ministeriall- Officer to sett out to each ?euery? man his propper diuident either by direc?on from hence, or to such as had acquired it there ?by purchase or seruice?, and therein cheifely to respect the auncient Aduenturers and Planters, with authority also to passe the said Grant? vnder the Collonies Seale if so they did desire it, but not to make an absolute Graunt of the said lands for that the Seale in that case was but a certificate or testimony of so much land sett out for the considera?ons aforesaid to be further rati- fied and confirmed by the Company here who only had power to con- firme the same vnto them: And further then this the Gouernor neither had nor could haue any authority from hence to dispose of land in Virginia, but this Graunt of Barkhams was held to be verie dishonorable and preiudiciall to the Companie in reguard it was lym- itted with a Proviso to compound with Opachankano, whereby a Soueraignity in that heathen Infidell was acknowledged, and the Companies Title thereby much infringed. It was also reputed a fraudulent deed vnto the Grauntee, and of purpose onely to drawe a ffee from him, wch by report is very excessiue, in that kinde, there beinge no lesse then 20li waight of Tobacco or 3li in money de?aunded by the Secretary there fore euery such priuate diuident of 50: or 100: acres passed vnder the Seale of the Colony, wch this Court held to be verie vnreasonable, and therefore for the preuention thereof ?hereafter? as also to avoid that confusion of grauntinge priuate Diui- dent? in the cheifest places wch many possessed themselues of, was §not§ with an intent to plante vpon the said land? so much as to pre- uent such other in their Diuident? as tooke Patent? here, without they compounded with them for these parcell? that laye intermingled It was for these reasons thought fitt to be referred to the iudgement of the next Quarter Court to consider of some course for a speedie reforma?on. Mr Grindall also presentinge the like Grant vnder the Collonies Seale of 150: acres bounded out and allotted vnto him at his first cominge away in considera?on of his seruice, for somuch as he hath promised to plant the same at his arriuall there by this next Shipping The Court herein beinge willinge to shewe fauor especially to such auncient Planters as shall deserue well by their seruice and intend to plant vpon the land sett out for them, haue ordered that a Letter shalbe writt to the Gouernor to giue order to the Surveyor to sett out the due propor?on of his said land and to bound the same euery waye within his iust lymitt?. Sr Edw: Sackuill beinge entreated by the former Court to acquaint the Lord? of his Mats Counsell with the Massacre of the English Col- lony in Virginia by the Indians there and with the present necessity of Armes and people to make a repara?on, did nowe report that with the first oppertunity he had accordingly informed their ?ps, and after some questions passed about some ?ticulars he entreated their ?ps media?on [56] to his Matie in their said suite wch they were pleased to performe whereof his Matie beinge informed as, also of the manner of this Accident with great indigna?on apprehended the cause thereof to be the same that their ?ps did vizt that the Planters in Virginia attended more ?their? present proffitt rather then their safety ?and pleasing their humors and fancies? by Lyvinge so scatteringly and dis- persedly pleasinge their owne humors and fancies: But his Matie was so farr sensible of the losse of so many of his Subiect? and of the present estate of the Colony as he was graceously pleased to promise them assistance, and therevpon de?aunded what the Companies desire. It was answeared Muni?on and people whereby they might be enhabled to take a iust revenge of those treacherous Indians, and to recouer what they had nowe lost as also to secure themselues against the like or any other forraigne Enimy that should offer to assault them wherevpon it pleased his Matie to promise them some such Armes out of the Tower as was desired whereof the Officers of the Tower brought some of each kinde and reported their store there to be as followeth.1 1 Letters and printed declarations on this subject, and the orders for arms for the Company are mentioned in List of Records, Nos. 293, 306, 318, 350, 354, 355, 356, 363, Vol. I, pages 152, 154, 155, 158, 159, and 160, ante.

The Court is continued by a generall Consent2 2 Written over the word "erec?on." of handes till all buissi- nesses were ordered. Mr Horwood peti?oninge for releas of his Sonne in lawe Robert Dauies from mr Rolfe hauinge serued out his three yeares accordinge to his Contract, as also that he might haue his Diuident of land for that he was furnished out at his charge, all wch he said he had wittnesses in Towne to proue: The Court hath entreated mr Deputy to examine his Wittnesses and therevpon ordered his peti?on should be reco?ended to the Gouernor of Virginia to do the said Robert Dauies right accordingly. Whereas it appeares by an Acquittance presented at the said Court vnto Sr Thomas Smiths hand dated the 9th of September i607 that mr that Wm Phetiplace beinge an auncient Planter paid vnto Sr Tho: Smith then Treasuror for Virginia the Some of 10li wch beinge some- what short of the purchase of a Share: The Court notwithstandinge vpon his humble request and promise to plant the same within some convenient time haue bin pleased to remitt him the odd money and to allowe him 100 acres of land old Aduenture vpon a first diuision for wch direc?on shalbe giuen to the Gouernor to cause the same to be sett out for him accordinge to the orders of the Companie. [57] Sr Edwin Sandys signified vnto the Courte that the Companie of the Su?er Ilands in their great Quarter Court held the Tenth daye of Iuly last had consented to the Contract intended to be made with his Matie for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco, but with some difference from the Virginia Companie touchinge the medium of the Custome thereof, for the Company of the Su?er Ilands havinge duely waighed and considered of all circumstances incident therevnto conceaued it would be more convenient and safe for them to paye the Custome of 6d the pounde ?weight? for Roll Tobacco and 4d for leafe as it came in, then to be tyed to paye the certainety of so great a So?e of money, as the medium came vnto, besides they considered that the Customers hauing by this meanes of grauntinge a medium their Customes made certaine, would take no care nor paines to discouer the stealinge in of Spanish Tobacco, whereas in payinge the Customer the proffitt of the Customers beinge also interessed therein, it would make them the more vigilent and carefull to prevent the vndue bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco and thereby also saue the Companie much charge, wch they must otherwise be at for ma?tayninge of a great number of officers for this purpose Wherevpon it beinge taken into considera?on whither an Inferior Court had any power to alter that wch was so solemnely ratified by a Quarter Court it was resolued it could not, but withall they held it fitt to signifie to my Lo: Treasuror and certifie by waye of Declaration of their perticular opinions that they con- ceaued the Su?er Ilands Companie for many substantiall reasons had taken the better course, and therefore the Companie of Virginia would not oppose the drawinge vp of the Patent accordinge to the desire and resolu?on of the Su?er Ilands Companie, not doubting but if the next Quarter Court for Virginia shall ?should not? aproue thereof they shall entreat his lp: their first order may Stand. Sr Io: Dauers mr Iermyn 2 Deputies mr Binge mr Gibbs mr Ro: Smith mr Wrote mr White mr Brooke mr Seldon mr Herbert mr Io: Smith or any fower of them are entreated to meete and aduise about the drawinge vp of the Patent touchinge the Contract to be made with his Matie for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco accordinge to the Propo- sitions agreed on by the Companies of Virginia and the Su?er Ilands in their great Quarter Court held this present month wch is to be donn in the most benificiall manner for the behoufe of both Companies, who are likewise desired to attend mr Atturny about the same: And also to take into their considera?on those thing? that are to be per- formed before the said Contract is to be in force as namely the pro- hibitinge the planting of Tobacco in England and Ireland also to prohibite the importinge of any Spanish ?Spanish?

Edward Peirs Cittizen and Marchantaylor of London, peti?oninge for leaue to administer vpon the estate of one Thomas Peirs his Brother, late inhabitinge neare Mulbery Ilands in Virginia (who was there slaine with his wife and child in the late Massacre) It was ordered that forsomuch as it hath bin testified as well by Certificate from Sr Wm Owen knight and Thomas Iones esquire Bayliffe of the Towne of Shrewsbury as also vpon oath taken of the Peticonr and one Robert Corbett by the Deputy and some other of his Mats Counsell for Vir- ginia that the said Edward Peirs is the onely Brother of the said Thomas deceased, and that he hath but one only Sister namely Ann Peirs lyvinge That the Gouernor and Councell of Virginia should be entreated to shewe the Peti?oner or his Assignes what lawfull fauor and assistance they may in the premisses that the Proprietors may receaue the benifitt of the proceed of those good? that shalbe found out with all expidi?on. Ioane Blancher peti?oninge likewise for that estate her Husband Iohn Blancher died seized of in Virginia: It was ordered that the like direc?on should be giuen to the Counsell there to cause enquirie be made what good? he lefte and not onely to giue an Account but also to returne the good? themselues or the proceed thereof (beinge sold to the value) to the Treasuror and Companie here to the vse and benifitt of the said Peticonr. A Certificate beinge presented in Court vnder the hand of diuers therein named, certifyinge that Iames Darey is the next heire of Iosua Darey who was lately slaine in Virginia: The Court ordered that forsomuch as this Certificate was testified to be true by mr Wheatley a Brother of this [64] Companie, it should be reco?ended to the Counsell of Virginia to cause enquirie be made what good? the said Iosua Darey died seized of, and to giue order that they be sold to the best value and to returne the proceed thereof to the Treasuror and Company here for the vse and benifitt of the said Iames Darey. The Brothers and Sisters of Captaine Nath: Powell peticoninge for order that their said Brothers estate might be enquired out and certi- fied, and the Proceed thereof returned vnto the Companie here for their vse and benifitt, It was ordered that it should be reco?- ended to the Counsell of Virginia to haue an espeaciall care of this buissines, both because it is of great consequence, as also for that Capt: Nath: Powell was a man of extraordinary merritt, and the Peti?oners poore men, wherefore they desired that Iustice and right may be donn them ?therein?, and that so speedily as the Peti?oners may receaue the benifitt thereof by the first returne of Shipps, and not onely an Account, but also the good? themselues or the proceed of them beinge sold to the value be returned to the Treasuror and Companie. Iohn Stephens and Raph Baylie peti?oninge both to one effect vizt that direc?on might be giuen to the Gouernor of Virginia to sett out their Diuident of land where and when he should thinke fittest for their safety and convenience; The Companie conceaued the Peti?on- ers request to be so resonable as they are assured the Counsell of Virginia will not deny it them, but be readie to shewe them and their people what fauor they may for the safe and convenient settlinge of them. The Companie beinge informed by the Auditors that Sr Geo: Yeardley in stead of 500li wch by the Counsell? Letter of the 18th of Decembr i619 he was co?aunded to returne for the 50 youthes then sent by his Mats Co?aund hath onely returned 3333li waight of Tobacco, wch beinge sent to Middleburrough and there sold comes to ?no? more then 275li 15 06 haue ordered that the Account of that Tobacco signed by the Auditors and Bookee? should be sent vnto mr Geo: Sandys Treasuror in Virginia to be shewed vnto the said Sr Geo: Yeardley and the rest whome it may concerne, and that they should be caused to make satisfac?on for the 224li 4: 6: wch is remayninge due vnto the Companie this yeare in good leafe Tobacco to be sent home in the Abigall. It was also further ordered that the Account of the Tobacco sent home last yeare to the Companie should be sent to mr Geo: Sandys, that he might see at what rate it was here sold and cause further satisfac?on to be giuen from whome it is due. [65] It was also ordered that a Coppie of Leiutenant Wm Peirs his Bond should be sent vnto mr Geo: Sandys who is required to leavy of the said Wm Peirs the 500li of Tobacco appearinge due to the Companie by the said Bond and to send it home in the Abigall. In these perticulars the Companie desire mr Geo: Sandys to be verie carefull and the Gouernor to giue him all the assistance that the Companie be not disappointed of so due debt? in this time of great necessity. And it is further ordered that the Gouernor of Virginia shall not here- after graunt leaue to any indebted to the Companie to returne for England vntill he hath giuen full satisfac?on for all such debt? as he shall stand charged with. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court, that mr Secretary Dauison had requested him humblie to tender to the considera?on of this Noble Company the great losse that he had endured this last yeare by want of 13 of of those 20 Tenant? that the Companie were pleased to graunt and promise to him: Wherevpon he humblie besought them, that they would bestowe vpon him at present in recompence or sat- isfac?on of that da?age the Su?e of 50li wch he would procure to be lent the Companie vnder their Seale at a yeares daye of payment, Mr Deputy added that he would not haue dared in this time of the Com- panies extreame pouerty to propound a matter of so great charge vnto them, but that he did for his part conceaue, that in trueth the doeinge of this, should be a matter rather of payment of debt then pointe of liberality, and besid? that mr Secretary Dauison himselfe had found the meanes for procuringe the money, and that after such a manner, as he for his part, should be verie glad, if all the Companies Debt? might be so discharged, but against this it was obiected, that Mr Sec- retary had receaued ffees in Virginia in recompence of his want of men, and further that he had not performed his seruice aboue halfe the time; And lastly that howsoeuer, the President would be verie dangerous whereby other Officers that had suffered the like da?ages would make the like demaund?: But for the first mr Deputy and his Brother mr Iohn ffarrar affirmed, that mr Secr? Dauison had sole?ly protested to them diuers times (they havinge challenged him thereof accordinge to some Letters that did seeme to import so much) that he had receaued no ffees at all or to no value at least, and that although there was at first an inten?on by the Gouernor and Counsell to make him satisfac?on after that manner; yet afterward consideringe with himselfe, that perhapp? it would be displeasinge to the Company here beinge so precisely forbidden by them he did relinquish it, rather puttinge himselfe vppon the Companies noblenes, And for the per- formance of his place that mr Geo: Sandys had vndertaken it out of his loue to him; and further that his cominge ouer [66] was in parte for the better Informa?on of the Counsell, of the State of the Colony: As for the last thinge it was generally adiudged to be a verie smale recompence for so great da?age and that the Companie should haue a verie great bargaine of it to satisfie propor?onably all the like demaund?. But in the end because the matter was of great waight in this necessitous time of the Companie it was thought fitt to reserue the matter of absolutely giuinge it to the iudgment of a Quarter Court; After full and certen knowledge of the perticulers in question and doubt; But that yet in the meane while for the accomodatinge of mr Dauison in his present vrgent occasions beinge to carry ouer his wife with him to Virginia, the said 50li offered by mr Weston to be lent, Should be accepted and the Companies Seale giuen for the payment of it at a yeares day And that the said 50li should be paid to mr Secr? Dauison, he giuinge his Bond to repaye it to the Companie in Ianuary i623.</field>

After the readinge of the former Court, a great part whereof con- sisted in the Answeares of many peti?ons that had bin presented, mr Deputy signified vnto the Court, that this manner of settinge downe the So?s of the peti?ons and of the Court? Answeares was a thinge of very great Trouble to the Secretary and himselfe, and many times perhapps neither the true meaninge of the Peticonr, nor of the Answeare, was so fully and plainely expressed as was fitt and requi- site, and therefore many times occasion of doeinge wronge might be ministred: Wherevpon he offered to the considera?on of the Court, that the very peti?ons themselues [67] should be registred and entred either in the Court book? or some perticuler booke for that purpose, and that the answeare of euery peti?on might be drawne vpp while the Court sat and read, wch would be a safe course both for the Companie and Peti?oners and likewise for the Deputy and Secretary, and this Course he thought the more necessarie in reguard the greatest part of the Petitions put vp to the Companie do not admitt the reveiwe and examina?on ?approba?on? of a second Court, but vpon the orderinge and §the§ execu?on doth i?ediately followe, as all the peti?ons read in the former Court and there ordered were the next day sent to Virginia whereby if there had been error in mistakinge the Companies meaninge it could not be remedied. Hee desired them farther likewise to take into their considera?on howe the multitude of Peti?ons daylie encreased, So that the Court? had not time nor leasure to order them wherevpon himselfe was con- tinually troubled with the importunity of Peti?oners for not receau- inge speedie satisfac?on as they did desire; wch did exceedingly molest him, and some of them did much clamor of the Companie: ffor redresse whereof, as also for the equall administra?on of Iustice and fauor vnto all, (wch he knewe to be the Companies principall intent) he desired that they would take into their considera?on what course and order should be held for the receauinge of Peti?ons for the informinge the Court of the ?ticularities of them and for the answearinge of them: Concerninge all wch point? and the former, he and some of the Coun- sell (wth whome he had conferred thereabout) conceaued that there might be so good and orderly a course sett downe as should much tend to the ease of the Court in expediting of peti?ones and to the speedie reliefe and satisfac?on of all due Complaynant? and iust Peti- ?ons: The Court hauinge debated these point? and findinge them verie waightie, and that it was most expedient to take some course therein did thinke fitt to referr the considera?on of them and all other matters incident to Peti?ons vnto a select Co?ittee which were then named (vizt) mr Gibbs. mr Ro: Smith. mr Wrote. mr Berblocke. mr Binge. mr Caswell. The two Deputies. &amp; mr Io: Smith. mr Mellinge. who are entreated to meete at mr Deputy fferrars howse on Monday in the Afternoon the 28th of this present Month and there to consult and aduise concerninge the point? formerly men?oned and all other ?ticulers belonginge to the matter of peti?ons and to sett downe their opinions and iudgement? thereof and to bringe the same in writinge to the next Court. Mr Deputy further acquainted the Court that diuers of the Counsell and Companie had of late obserued some e?ors and default? in the transportinge of persons and good?, wch if there were not some timely remedy for preuention [68] would both breed much wronge to the private Planters that goe ouer, and hereafter great trouble and vexa?on to this Court: The point? were three: ffirst that diuers Shipps nowe goeinge daylie (aswell from London as other part?,) without any fur- ther Referrence to the Companie then a Comission from them, there was no Note or Register kept of the names of the persons transported, whereby himselfe and the other officers were not able to giue any satisfac?on to the persons, that did daylie and howerly enquire after their frend? gon to Virginia, to the great discontent of people here, and that this likewise would proue a thinge of great trouble and molesta?on to the Court when after the expira?on of i624, either the persons themselues transported or their heires should come to clame their diuisions of land?, the Companie hauinge no ground to knowe, what or why any thinge should be due vnto them but their owne wordes: The second pointe was that many times the Passengers shippinge their good? themselues and through ignorance and want of vnderstandinge in such affaires, not takinge that course as they ought, though their good? were imbeaselled by the Marriners in the waye ?yet? they could come to no right, wantinge sufficient proufe of the deliuery of them abourd the Mr; and if any priuate man hapned to dye, all his goodes were presently imbeazelled and as it were confis- cated by the Marriners, that afterward his friend? could neuer come to recouer any of them, nor tell wch waye to goe about it, There beinge no publique euidence of the receauinge of the said good? abourd, and if there were any priuate they perished with the Party himselfe; The third thinge was the prouidinge by some fitt course that the Cou- enant? between Mrs and Servant? might be respectiuely ?formed, to the full, that neither oppression nor fraude might be exercised by the one or other: In both wch kind?, there were many complaint? both of Mr and Servant? wch were daylie like to encrease and as the Planta?on did augment and especially the wrong? of Servant?, It beinge obserued here that diuers old Planters and others did allure and beguile diuers younge ?sons and others (ignorant and vnskillfull in such matters) to serue them vpon intollerable and vnchristianlike condi?ons vpon promises of such reward? and recompence, as they were no wayes able to performe nor euer meant: These three head? beinge discussed by the Court, were conceaued to be very waightie and were therefore referred to the considera?on of the former Co?ittee. And likewise vpon remonstrance by some other what inconveniences did arise in Virginia for want of a sett and orderly course for the prouing of Will? and Testament? and other thing? thereto belonginge, the former Co?ittee were likewise desired to take that buissines into their considera?ons and to deliuer their opinions and iudgement? therein to the next Court in writinge of all the premisses. [69] The Court hath likewise referred the perticular greiuance of Tho: Goldsmith touchinge his Sonne Arthur detayned by Sr Geo: Yeardley as his Tenant, to the examina?on of the said Co?ittee, who are duely to informe themselues and consider of each perticuler circumstance and to certifie howe they finde it together with their opinions what they thinke fitt to be donne therein. Mr Deputy signified vnto the Companie, it was not vnknowne vnto them, that amongst the many worthie Guift? bestowed on the Plan- ta?on there was the last yeare giuen, by a person refusinge as yet to be named 40s ? Añu for euer (and therevpon an order established) for a Sermon to be preached before the Virginia Companie euery Mic?as Terme on Wedensday fortnight before the last Wedensday in the said Terme, Hee therefore moued to knowe their pleasure whome they would entreat to preach the said Sermon; Wherevpon some propos- inge the Dean of Paules, the Court without naminge any other, did verie much desire he might be entreated therevnto, hopinge he would please vpon their generall request signified vnto him, to vnder ke the paines and the rather for that he was a Brother of this Companie and of their Counsell In confidence whereof the Court praid Sr Io: Dauers mr Binge &amp; Sr Phil: Carey mr Deputy to solicite him earnestly herevnto in the name of the Companie; wch they promised to performe, and for the place where the Sermon is to be preached. The Court haue made choise of St Michaell? Church in Cornehill as the most convenient: After wch Ser?on ended, it is also thought fitt and agreed the Custome they beguñ the last yeare shalbe continued namely to suppe together, and for that cause haue entreated mr Caswell and mr Mellinge (who last time so well ?formed it to all the Companies content) beinge assisted with mr Bennett and mr Rider to be Steward? this yeare also, for prouidinge and orderinge of the Supper and buissines therevnto belonging and of the place where it shalbe kept, and accordingly to giue notice thereof vnto all the Companie by sendinge the Officer with Tickett? that are to be printed for this purpose, notifyinge the time and place and what each man is to paye, wch is nowe agreed shalbe iijs a peece as findinge by the last yeares experience it cannot be lesse to beare out the full charge: And for that at such great feast? Venizon is esteemed to bee a most neces- sary Complement, the Court hath thought fitt that letters be addressed in the name of the Company vnto such Noblemen and Gentlemen as are of this Society to request this fauor at their hand? and withall their presence at the said Supper.1 1 This sermon, preached November 13, was printed. It is referred to, List of Records, No. 375, Vol. I, page 161, ante. A letter concerning the sermon is given in List of Records, No. 381, Vol. I, page 161, ante. [70] Mr Deputy acquainted the Companie that whereas they hired hereto- fore certaine Dutch Carpenters of Hamburrough for makinge of Saw-mill? in Virginia whither they beinge sent, died within a short time after (and onely one returned) beinge §hauing§ effected nothinge in that buissines, and that notwithstandinge satisfac?on hath bin giuen to the ffull vnto their Wiues, for so longe time as their said Husbands Liued accordinge to their contract?; yet through the insti- ga?on and Clamerous report? of him that returned these weomen were stirred vp to put in suite those English men that had giuen Security at Hamburrowgh for payment of their said Husband? wages, demaundinge of them no lesse then their ffull paye as if they had liued out their times: Insomuch as the said English were cõstrained (to auoide further trouble and charge of Suite) to agree with them and vpon a Composi?on to giue them 27li to surcease their suite, wch they hoped the Companie here would againe repaye, consideringe it was for their cause, and therefore had nowe made ouer a Bill of Exchange to be paide by the Companie; wch the Court taking into their considera?on, although they found of right nothinge to be due to the said weomen, beinge formerly satisfied, yet seeinge the stand- inge out in the Suite against them might drawe on a further charge wch would hardly be recouered againe of the Plts 1 1 Plaintiffs. (beinge verie poore) and consideringe also on the other side what hard measure it were that the English (wch entred into this Security on the Companies be- halfe) should be forced to paye this money, did therefore agree and order that the said So?e should be discharged accordinge to their request vpon the said Bill. Capt: Hamers Letter was read, relatinge some accident? that had happned in the Colony since the Massacre, the killinge of certen Indians, burninge of their Townes, the ioyninge with the Kinge of Patomecke against Opachankano Cap: Maddison sent vnto him with 30: English, the insolent Answr of Opachankano to the Gouernors message for restoringe of the captiue English, with the dishonor he did to the Kings Picture, the resolu?on of ye Gouernor and Counsell at the end of August to make Warre vpon Opachankano, with 500 men, hopinge by God? helpe this winter to cleare the Country of him and setlinge the Colony in a farr better estate, then it was before, and that this Massacre will proue much to the speedie aduancemt of the Colony and much to the benifitt of all those that shall nowe come thither.

Which orders beinge reade through and after agayne by severall part? reexamined and deliberated uppon the Courte did well aprove of them and theruppon being putt to ye Question were ratified by the Gen- erall Consent of ye whole Courte. The next thing taken into consideration was both the number and Quallity of those that should be apoynted Committees of wh it was thought fitt that the Auditors should always bee in regard of there greate experience and practize in the Compagnys affayres and yt there should bee ioyned unto them eight or ten more and yt out of this number three of at least wherof the Deputy to bee one might bee always present for the receiving and considering of Petitions and further yt the Committee shoulde bee yearely chosen uppon the day of Election of the Treasuror and other Officers and yt there shoulde bee yeerly ?an? alteration of some of them for the better information of others in the Compagnys affayres and buissinesses. Thees things being putt to the Question were severally ratifyde and confirmed by erection of hands and to bee of the Committee for the present yeare were nominated theese following Sr Edwyn Sandys. Sr Ihon Brooke. Sr Iohn Davers. mr Deputy. first the 6 Auditors namely mr Ihon Wroth. mr Wrott. mr Ihon Farrar. unto whom wer Ioyned mr Ihon Smith. mr Ghibb?. mr Byng. mr Keightly. mr Tomlyn?. mr Robert Smith. mr Bennett mr Caswell divers petitions presented to this Courte were referred to y sayd Committee. [73] And whereas the former Co?ittee had considered and deliuered their opinions touchinge the peti?on and complaint of one Tho: Goldsmith against Sr Geo: Yeardley for deteyninge his Sonne Arthur as his Tennant: The Court Caused their order vpon the said Peti?on to be sett downe in this manner vizt: It hauinge bin approued vnto the Court by oath of two Wittnesses that the frend? of Arthur Goldsmith haue for the settinge fourth of him and mainetayninge him since disbursed to the value of 40li as by a Bill of the ?ticulers exhibited appeareth, and further that by his frend? he was put to Sr Geo: Yeardley for three yeares and no longer do therefore iudge that what Contract soeuer the said younge man may haue since made with Sr Geo: Yeardley without the approba?on of his frend? (touchinge seruinge him as a Tenant or ffearmor) ought to be voide and of none effect and accordingly order, that i?ediately vpon the receipt hereof the said Arthur Goldsmith be discharged from the seruice of Sr George Yeardley and sett free, to be disposed of, accord- inge as his frend? shall thinke fitt: Prouided alwayes that if Sr Geo: Yeardley vpon this newe Contract shall haue deliuered him any Stocke, or haue bin at any charges with him, the said Stocke and charges shalbe satisfied and repaid to the said Sr Geo: Yeardley. Sr Iohn Dãuers and some others beinge requested by the former Court to entreat the Deane of Paules to preach the Sermon before the Com- panie on Wedensday the i3th of Nouemb: did nowe make report that the Deanes Answeare was verie fauourable and respectiue of the Companie, and that hauinge acknowledged with many thanks that courtesie they had donn him, by choosinge him to be of their Counsell, hee seemed glad they had occasion to vse him in that kinde wherein he was able to do them seruice and therevpon promised to be ready at the time appointed to ?forme their request, wch gaue the Companie very much content. Capt: Iohn Martin presenting a peti?on to the Court for reforma?on of his Patent in such thing? as should be founde to transcend the lymitta?on of the King? Letters Patents vnto the Companie or hor hurtfull vnto the proceeding? of the Colony was admonished to sur- render it vp with all his defect? and exorbitances and take a newe wch although he refused to do at the first, yet vpon a better bethinkinge with himselfe, and the Companies faire [74] offer vnto him to graunt him a newe Patent with as large and ample priuiledges as any other Aduenturer wch from time to time they had alwaies offered vnto him, did at length freely and willingly deliuer vp the same in open Court to be cancelled wherevpon order was giuen for drawinge vp a newe Patent for him against the next Quarter Court. Capt Bargraue herevpon tooke occasion to informe the Court that Capt Martin had of late (contrary to due forme and to the great wronge of the Companie) procured an order from the Right Honoble the Lord Keeper for sequestra?on of all his Cattle in Virginia; till the matter in difference between them were decided wch manner of proceedinge for that it did verie much concerne the Companie, he praied the Court would take it into their considera?on; wherevpon Capt: Martin made offer to referr the cause to any different men of the Companie, where- vnto the other agreeinge, Capt: Martin chose Sr Edw: Sackuill and Capt Bargraue Sr Iohn Brooke whome after both ?ties had declared themselues willinge to submitt to their award and iudgement, the Court entreated to take some paines to heare and determine the differ- ences between them. fforsomuch as the Afternoone was nowe farr spent the Court was ordered to be continued till all buissinesses were heard and ended. Mr Iohn ffarrar acquainted the Court that Sr Arthur Ingram hauinge sent for him told him, That the Lord Treasuror was desirous to knowe the Companies resolu?on whither they would proceed in the Contract intended with the Kinge accordinge to the Propositions agreed on in their Quarter Court? Touching wch Sr Arthur said he had onely one thinge more for my Lord Treasuror to moue vnto the Companie Vizt: That whereas in the former Propositions it was referred vnto a Comittee to consider what sort? of Spanish Tobacco should be brought into this Kingdome by the Companies his lp: desired it might nowe be resolued vpon to bringe in all of the best Varinaes wch Propositions beinge taken into considera?on by the Court These obie?ons were made against it vizt: That the graunt hereof should ?would? dissolue the frame of the Bargaine formerly proposed, first because it would make an alter?aon in the prices and rat? they were agreed to sett vpon the Tobacco that should be brought in, and consequently that it would occasion the stealinge [75] in of much Spanish Tobacco, wch by the other meanes might be preuented, and lastly that it would much hinder the sale of the Virginia Tobacco: Besid? it was likewise doubted whither so great a quantitie as 40000 waight of the best Varinas could be had, seeinge it was more then was knowne to come of that sort into Spayne in some one yeares, so that to be tyed to bringe in the former quantitie could not but be verie inconvenient &amp; preiudiciall vnto the Companies: Wherevnto answeare was made, that the Companies could not be tyed to ?forme impossibilities, And besid? the eight Article of the Propositions did seeme to prouide against it, wch beinge read and aduised vpon, it was at length conceaued, that rather then the bargaine should be dissolued the former Propositions should be yealded vnto: And the rather because mr Iohn ffarrar did affirme that Sr Arthur did promise and protest, that this being graunted, there should be no other exception or altera?on in the bargaine but should proceed on accordingly in all point? as was agreed by the Companie. ffor the manner of yealdinge vnto it mr Wrote beinge desired to drawe vp a forme did it in manner followinge It is agreed that it shalbe signified to the Lo: Treasuror that the Companies for Virginia and the Su?er Ilands, haue that affiance in his lps noble fauor toward? them, that they are contented to yeald to his lp: Proposition of bringinge in of the best sort? of Span- ish Tobacco to the quantitie of 40000 waight for the first two yeares of the Contract intended as the markett in Spaine will yeald at such times, as they buy the same, vnles his lp: shall otherwise dispence therewith for the Kings seruice and good of the Companies, wch Draft beinge presented to the Companie and read was well approued of and ratified by the Court, And after this Court being dissolued into a So?er Ilands Court and the same againe proposed vnto that Companie it was in like manner ratified and confirmed by them. Vpon a mo?on for a Patent for mr Iohn Palmer and his Associat? for a perticuler Planta?on vndertakinge to transport 10 100 ?sons The Court gaue order for drawinge a Patent for him. Mr Io: ffarrar passed ouer one of his shares of land of 100 acres in Virginia to mr Edmund Hun gen? wch was accordingly confirmed vnto him. [76] Sr Henry Rich and the Lady Isabella his wife passed ouer fower shares of land in Virginia to mr Henry Percy (the said Shares beinge discended to the said Lady as the sole Daughter and heire of Sr Wal- ter Cope deceased) wch Assignemt the Auditors hauinge allowed the Court ratified and confirmed ?vnto the said Henry Piercy.? Mr Henry Reinolds likewise passed ouer two shares vnto his Nephew mr William Vesie of Graies Inn gen? wch beinge allowed by the Audi- tors the Court also confirmed.</field>

The Court beinge cheifely ordained for preparinge of buissines for the Quarter Court to consider of there was first read the opinions of the Co?ittee sette downe in writinge touchinge the Registringe of Pas- sengers names that goe to Virginia in priuate Shipps the Coppie whereof doth here ensue The Committees fynde that there are very greate inconveniencys for want of a perfect Register of all mens names that goe to Virginia: ffirst the Companie knoweth not what land is Due to men and euery Day vniust and false claimes are put vp especially vpon pretences of beinge heires to persons that haue and do transport thenselues freely. Secondly ?when? a reveiwe shalbe made in Virginia howe all men are possessed of their lande? wch wilbe most necessarie to be donn in reguard of the great Disorder ?and lycentiousnes? wch men there vse in takinge out land and not due to them it wilbe a matter of great trouble to all private Planters that come ?not? in the Companies Shipps to proue that they came ouer at their owne charges, and except they do, that it wilbe verie dangerous and vnsafe to the Companie to make confirma?on of lande? to them wch ?happs others haue better right vnto. Thirdly it is a thinge of marveylous great satisfac?on to all men whose frends goe to Virginia to vnderstand when and howe they went: and the contrary is of exceedinge discontent and greife diuers ?sons cominge daylie from the far- thest parte? of England to enquire of frends and Kindred gonn to Virginia &amp; because there is onely notice kep of them that goe in the Shipps vndertaken by the Companie there can be no Account giuen of the others whereby ariseth likewise a great disreputa?on of ye Companie for want of iudgement and proui- dence in their proceedinge?. [78] ffourthly the aduantage of an vncontrolled goeinge doth invite many lewd and wicked persons to robbe and steale from their frends Maisters Cr as hath bin founde by some examples in those Shipps wch the Company did not vndertake verie much to the disreputa?on of the Ac?on and on the contrary no such thinge hath happned in those Shipps, that are sett forth by the Companie wicked and infamous persons not daring to shewe themselues so much in the light and yet on the contrary, it hath not bin any hinderance to any honest minded persons who oppressed with pouerty and Debte? haue of necessity and not wickedly bin constrained to goe. ffor the redressinge of these and many other great inconveniences: The Co?it- tees conceaue these remeadies. ffirst that it should be published and made knowne by a lawe and order that all persons Desirous to goe to Virginia should giue vp their names to the Comp- anie and that no Maisters of Shipps should presume to carry any without giuinge vp the name of the person to the Companie. Secondly that for the receauinge of Passengers names there should be a per- ticuler Officer appointed wch they conceaue fittest to be ye Bookeeper who should towarde? the goeinge of euery Shippe attend two or three dayes in the weeke at the howse where the Courte? are kept to receaue the names of all such persons as are to goe to Virginia. The said Officer shall in a booke booke register euery mans name age Coun- try profession and kindred and likewise whither he goe at his owne charge or other, ffor doeinge whereof he shall haue from the party such a ffee as the Quarter Courte? shall from time to time order him; And it beinge a smale matter, it cannot but be gladly giuen of the party in reguard that it wilbe his evidence for the settinge out of his land in Virginia. The said Officer shall by euery Shippinge send a Coppie of all the ?sons names as formerly registred vnto the Gouernor and Counsell of State and from them shalbe yearely returned an Account what and howe the ?sons come in euery Shippe haue bin disposed and bestowed, to the intent that their frende? here vpon enquiry may receaue satisfac?on. The said Officer shall not reveale afore the Shippe be gonne the names of any Passenger who shall desire to haue his name kept secrett, except that he knowe him to be a malefactor, vnworthy to goe, and if any shall come to enquire of any such person desiring to be kept secret the said Officer shall demaund of those that enquire the reason of their enquiry and shall therewith acquaint the Treasuror and followe such Direc?ons as he shall receaue from him either for the manifestinge or concealinge of the party. ffor the Shipps that goe not from London but from other parte? they thinke fitt, the mr should be bound by his Co?ission to returne vnto ye officer here at London a list of the names as is formerly expressed to be registred here in the Companies booke together with the ffee for the same, neither shall they require therefore but one single fee. Wch orders beinge read were well liked of and referred to the Quartr Court for confirma?on. [79] Sr Edward Sackuill acquainted the Court that Captaine Martin had made greiuous complainte vnto him, that the newe Patent vpon the resigna?on of his old ordered to be drawne was with such condi?ons, as he was not able to ?forme, and verie much to his wronge and pre- iudice beinge abridged of a great quantitie of land that was due vnto him, and namely that therein he was bound to carrie 100 men, wch he could haue no hope to doe by reason of his weake estate: To wch Answeare was made that there was not intended a forfeiture of his Patent if that condi?on were not performed to the full, but onely a quantity of land propor?onable to the number of men wch he should carry. ffor the second pointe Captaine Martin pretended he was cut short and abridged of a great deale of land giuen him by his former Patent wch beinge called for and read it was found to be an vniust and vntrue complaint for all the land giuen him in the former was also giuen him in this newe Patent, But Capt: Martin pretended that whereas in the first Patent there was giuen vnto him 10 Shares for the reward of his great Seruices, as is there expressed, That euery one of those Shares ought to be 500 acres of land and so there was due vnto him 5000 acres vpon that ground, for wch he desired that the Spott of land (as he called it) wherein he formerly planted beinge about 6000 acres of ground should be sett out vnto him: But the Court hauinge neuer heard before of any such matter, and findinge it directly by the Kings Letters Patents, that a share should not be aboue 100 acres, would not consent vnto Capt: Martins Demaund, As for giuinge him any land by waye of gratuity havinge bin once recompenced to the full by the iudgement of his best frende? (as by his Patent appeareth,) the Court sawe no reasons to bestowe any newe fauors in this kinde vpon him, consideringe that since that time he had donne nothinge of seruice to the Colony of Virginia and here at home, had of late so wronged the Company, as but that the Companie had a respect to their owne honor in nobly passinge ouer iniuries, and so to some ?sons of honor who did interceed for him here, but they should haue thought and endeau- oured to haue him punished and made an example: But yet he per- sistinge in his opinion, the Court gaue him time till the Quarter to make proufe that there was euer any such thinge ordered as that a single share should be accounted 500 acres. [80] Sr Edwin Sandys signified that the Ea: of Southampton and himselfe had lately bin with my Lo Treasuror, to moue his lp: that the Con- tract intended with the Kinge might be brought to some conclusion at this Quarter Court: Wherevpon it pleased his lp: to promise to send the Articles as they had bin formerly agreed on and signed with his hand and with the addi?on onely of that Clause touchinge the bringinge in of virinaes, so that Sr Edwin Said he expected they would be brought in before the risinge of this Court. Wherevpon mr Deputy tooke occasion to moue that seeinge the bar- gaine was so like to goe forward accordinge to the condi?ons agreed on by both Companies that it was high time to thinke of the man- aginge and ordered thereof, in reguard ?that? all the Tobacco from the Su?er Ilande? and a great quantitie from Virginia was like to come home before the next Quarter Court, and for taking order for bring- inge home of the Spanish Tobacco, it was not without great preiudice alreadie so longe delayed as had bin signified vnto him by diuers skill- full Marchaunte?, wch mr Bennett beinge in the Court did likewise affirme. ffor the takinge therefore of these thinge? into ?their? considera?on and ye makinge some kinde of prepara?on against the Quarter Court, The Court appointed ?acquainted? the Co?ittee hereafter chosen out of the Companies the 5o Iunij last vizt Ea: of Southampton. Sr Io: Brooke. Sr Edwin Sandys. for the Virginia Companie Sr Iohn Dauers. mr Nicho: ffarrar Dp?. mr Bennett. mr Io: Smith. mr Ro: Smith. Lo Cauendish. mr Barnard ye elect Gou9nor. for the Sumer Ilande? Companie mr Io ffarrar Dp?. mr Caswell T?er. mr Gibbs. mr Ditchfeild. Lo: Padgett. Lo: Haughton. vnto whome were added by this Courte mr Wrote. mr Sheppard. mr Mellinge. mr mr Meuerell. mr Withers. [81] who were entreated to meet about it to morrowe in the morninge after- noon ?at 3 of the clock? at mr Deputy ffarrars howse and afterward at such time as they shall thinke most convenient, And the Court further declared their minde? and intente? that since they could not (wch they much desired) avoide the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco and that of the best Varinaes they thought it fitt both for the publique good of the Planta?ons and Companie, and also in reguard it was likely to be a matter of ?fitt that it should be ?formed, by the Brothers of the Companie (who with their paines and purses haue vpheld the Planta?on) and not to admitt any Strangers into it (whereof it was conceaued many would be verie desirous) except such as should buy any fower shares of land of the Companie of 12li 10 the Share, a course ?wch? vpon wch the like occasion was held for the admittinge men into the Su?er Ilande? Companie, these thinge? beinge put to the question were by erec?on of hande? confirmed. After this was read the orders of the former Co?ittee touchinge the Registringe of Contracte? between priuate men of the Company and their Servante? the Coppie whereof doth here ensue. The Committees fynde many greate inconveniencie? and Abuses in the Carri- ing over of Servante? to Virginia vpon condi?ons and bargaines made by worde of mouth onely. ffirst diuers vngodly people that haue onely respect of their owne proffitt do allure and entice younge and simple people to be at the whole charge of trans- portinge themselues and yet for diuers yeares to binde themselues Servante? to them vpon hopes and promises of such rewards and recompence at the expira- ?on of their times as they are no waye able to performe, but because the promise is onely made by worde of mouth and without wittnesse; at least of any that do vnderstand the affaires of the Plantation they are bold to promise many things whatsoeuer and in this kinde Diuers complainte? haue come of late of ffathers and others abused in settinge forth his Children and Kindred. Secondly there comes Daylie complainte? from Virginia of people that are kept and Detained Servante? by their Maisters, longer then the time couenanted wch because it was not expressed nor manifested by writinge the Maister as the stronger party take? advantage to prolong as himselfe thinke? good. Thirdly whatsoeuer the condi?ons haue bin here yet when the Servant is come into Virginia if he cannot shewe the contrary in writinge the Maister make? his seruice of the longest and hardest nature of seruice and either by faire or fowle meanes the poore seruant is enticed or constrained there to enter coue- nante? in writinge, &amp; those such as he would haue here neuer haue yelded vnto, and in this respect diuers Planters do pollitiquely forbeare from makinge Couenante? here and reserues it to be Donn in Virginia. And on the contrary as by this meanes the Servante? are oppressed by those Planters that carry them ouer: So likewise the Aduenturers here that send ouer Servante? either without condi?ons in writinge as many do, or vpon con- di?ons drawne by ordinary Scriueners who not vnderstandinge the different nature of seruice there and here make confused and ?plexed Couenante? and nothinge at all expressing [82] the true meaninge of the party wronged and abused by the Servant sent ouer, who either pretend their time of seruice to be shorter then indeed it is, or ele? challenge greater reward and wages then was promised and generally De?aund all such benifitte? as the most aduantage- able condi?ons of seruice that they can heare of enioyeth although there was noe such thinge intended in their Contracts. Nowe for the full redresse of these abuses and for preventinge and avoyding that neither Servante? be oppressed by vniust Maisters there nor Servants §Maisters§ here wronged and abused by faithles servante? there and to the intent that all thinge? beinge clearely and plainely expressed, iustice and right may be had and performed on both parte?: The Comittees Do thinke it fitt that there should be lawe and order made that all men that shall send or carry Servante? or Tenante? to Virginia should binde the said Tenante? or Servante? vnto them by Couenante? in writinge and that Coppies thereof should remayne here in the Court. To wch intent they thinke fitt the Companie should make choise of some man expert of these affaires of the Plantation and nature of the Ac?on who should Drawe and engrosse all such Couenante? accordinge to the heads presented vnto him, and should see the sealinge and Deliuery of ye Couenante? by either party and this Officer should send Coppies of all such Couenante?1 1 Written over the word "Contracte?." to Virginia by euery Shippe that goeth wch should there by some Officer to that purpose chosen be kept safe and orderly to the intent that vpon complaint of wronge either §by§ Mr or Servant right and Iustice might be donn to the party greiued. They thinke fitt likewise that the Co?ittee appointed for peti?ons should at some certaine times consider and pervse these kinde of Contracts to ye intent that if they shall finde any of vniust and vnchristian nature as oppressiue or otherwise they may be dissanulled and made voide. They thinke likewise in fauor and encouragement of poore people that goe Servante? that such wages and rewarde? as are promised them at the expira?on of their seruice should be paid and Discharged by their Maisters to the full and that they should haue a precedency of all other Debte? whatsoeuer except those that are due vnto the generall Companie. They thinke fitt that the Officer for his Draweinge of these Contracts should haue a reasonable fee proporconable to that wch is paid here in London for Contracts of the like kinde. They conceaue that this cannot be any way greiuous vnto any man for the thinge it self is of absolute necessity that the Couenante? &amp; condi?ons should be expressed in writing &amp; exceedinge benificiall to all that meane honestly and that the Drawinge of them should be by an Officer chosen by the Companie and not by any other, is the practise of all other Companies and Societies, and in the Virginia Companie so much more necessarily to be practised by howe much more it is their Duety to endeauor that all ye affaires and ac?ons of the Colony in Virginia should haue a dependancy vpon the Companie here and thereby they may be more closely cymented vnto this State, and beside? it seemeth vnto ye Comittees a verie fitt ?that all? euidence pledable in Virginia should either originally or at least by Attesta?on be made Records of this Court. Wch beinge read the Court did well like of referringe the confirma?on ?ratification? of them, as also the appointinge of fitt Officers for this buissines vnto the Quarter Court. [83]</field>

Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that the moneyes for the Magazine were nowe due, and certified them that himselfe and mr Barbor had disbursed well neare 250li for settinge forth of the Shippwrighte? wch was to be repaid out of the said moneyes and that also he had dis- bursed for the settinge forth of the people lately sent to Martins Hundred aboue 100li wch was to be repaide from the Magazine. To wch Magazine about 3 yeares and a halfe agoe the Society of Martins Hundred had paid in 80li to the intent there should be deliuered ten kine in Virginia wch were neuer deliuered to their people, but sold by mr Abraham Peirs the Capm9cht at i5li a Cowe and the proceed thereof returned to the Account of the Magazine. Hee further also acquainted them that mr Bull and mr Caswell the Treasuror had for the reliefe of the Colony in Virginia taken vp 200li worth of meale vpon their Bille? wch was to be satisfied them, out of the moneyes of this Magazine: Diuers Brothers of the Company hauinge in the last Roll of Subscription vnderwritt and promised to aduenture these seuerall Somes that that should be due to them vpon the [84] diuision of these moneyes nowe due: Nowe in reguard that these disbursmente? had bin made by himselfe, and others for the seruice of the Companie here, and exceedingly for the aduancemt and releife of the Planta?ons and Colony, Hee desired that the Court would giue order to the T?ers of the Magazine instantly to demaund paymente? of the money accordinglie as was agreed, to the intent him- selfe and others beinge satisfied ?of? the moneyes due vnto them (whereof at present he had verie great vse) might be encouraged and thereby enhabled to doe the Companie seruice in the like kinde? vpon ?then? wch nothinge was more needfull, in reguard that daylie there was disbursemente? to be made for the Companies publique affaires wch hardly himselfe or any other would be ?swaded to doe, except they should herein finde ye Compã very carefull of their safties and satis- fac?on: And beinge further testified and approued vnto the Court that the Bargaine and Contract was made with mr Essington to paye at the daye precisely And also that although in the makinge of the bargaine mr Essington had by worde of mouth promised to paye in 200li within a Month; yet neuertheles he would not do it except he had allowance of 10li ? Cent? for the time he paide it in before, wch accordingly the Treasurors were forced to buy ?giue?: The Court thought themselues the lessed to forbeare the money longer then the daye, and beside? that it was ?were? a verie vniust and vnworthie thinge in them, for to do mr Essington courtesie, to do so greate wronge and discourtesie to mr Deputy and others who had bin longe out of their moneyes: wherefore it was ordered that the Treasurors should the next daye after, demaund payment of mr Essington of the moneyes due, and earnestly solicited the same: And in case that within 14 dayes after it was donn due at the furthest they receaued it not, they should then put the Bill of mr Essington and his Partners in suite, And this was so much the rather ordered because they were informed by the Treasurors that mr Essington had some fowerteen dayes or three weeke? agoe told them that he was to stopp 400li for the vse of Sr Samuell Argall, in reguard that certaine Bille? of Exchange wch he brought ouer wch him from mr Peirs, were not paid, but mr Peirs hauinge ?being? priuately examined about the matter, had dis- couered that those bille? beinge not paid here in England were sent backe vnto him againe and that therevpon he had made satisfac?on for them to the full in Tobacco and brought it to the Account of the Magazine as appeared fairely in his booke, wch mr Essington hauinge, could not be ignorant of: Wherevpon the Treasuror mr Bull certified the Court that that was but a Cauill, that since that mr Essington had againe pretended that mr Alderman Iohnson would stopp some of the moneyes for payment (as he said) of certaine So?es, for wch he stood [85] engaged for the Magazine Account and were yet vndischarged, But this mr Bull the Treasuror made answeare (as he affirmed) that if Alderm: Iohnson could rightly ?iustly? claime any thinge of ye Magazine he should be iustly paid; But as for Shippinge of any of these moneyes he could not allowe it Wch were to be paid vnto him and mr Caswell (the bille? beinge made vnto them) and accordingly mr Essington was to resolue to doe: wch Answeare the Court well liked of and thought fitt. And because the moneyes beinge paid in it wer fitt to knowe what each man was to receaue and that the auccount should be fully and perfectly audited, to the entent thereby that the great scandall and imputa?on wch lay vpon the Company and for this vnthriftie and per- nitious enterprize, wch had somuch distasted the Colony in Virginia, and yet exceedingly impaired the Estate of the Aduenturers here, might either be altogether taken awaye or at least laid vpon them, whoe did deserue it: It was by many mo?oned that nowe at last they might come to the true knowledge of the State and carriage of that Magazine wch was conceaued would be donn by an exact Survey and audite aswell of the Accounte? kept here as of those brought home by the Capemarchant as also by the ?vsall of the Letters and Instructions mutually giuen and returned on both ?ties, to Wch intent there were nominated diuers Auditors vizt mr Bull. mr Withers. mr Mellinge. mr Caswell. mr Boothby. mr Cuffe. who were entreated out of hand to audite the Account, and to giue vp vnto the Court a Declaracon of the true State and carriage of that buissines from the begininge vnto the present, But diuers of them desiringe that mr Deputy might be ioyned with them he excused him- selfe in reguard of the multitude of important buissinesses that laye vpon him; wch although they acknowledged to be so yet they would not be satisfied except he would with the rest vndertake it, wch in the end he said vpon their comaund he was content to do, so that the Audite might be in such a manner as might indeed be really and effectually performed, wch was that all the booke?, Letters and others might be deliuered vp, to be ?vsed by the Auditors at their leasure, that therevpon they might make such proufe and examina?ons as they should thinke good, as for the auditinge after the manner as formerly hath bin, he proffessed he would haue no hand in it, knowinge very well howe in a short and cursorie runninge ouer of booke? many errors might passe greatly to the preiudice of the Stocke and in the end per- happs to the discreditt of those who had allowed them. [86] The Court seemed verie apprehensiue of this matter, in reguard of some fresh examples where the strict ?vsall of Accounte? had brought forth verie great proffitt vpon some Vndertakinge? wch heretofore vsed to come forth with losse or verie litle benifitt not to be spoken of: And therevpon it was by erec?on of hande? ordered that mr Bull mr Mellinge and mr Cuffe should desire of mr Essington and mr Peirs the Capemarchant the seuerall Accounte? Letters and Instruc?ons wch if they should not willingly doe * * * ?although they sawe no rea- son why? they should not trust them (there beinge no possibility to falsifie or alter any thinge) they were then to require them in the Companies and Aduenturors name to giue them Coppies thereof, and for the transcribinge, it was ordered the Magazine should allowe them and this course beinge so iust and reasonable they conceaued the Accountante? would not be against, neither to denie it, nor to delaye it, either of wch thinge?, if they should goe about to doe, the Court professed and declared that they would therein seeke such remeady as befitted them vpon so plaine wronge and abuse. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court with a Noble Guift of the Lo: St Iohn of Basinge (vizt) 60 Cote? of Male wch for the defence of the Country at the mo?on of Sr Iohn Dãuers in the name of the Companie he sent vp in August last and were sent in the Abigaile: The Court so kindly accepted both of the Guift, and the manner, as they thought fitt, that in their name verie harty thanke? should be presented vnto his Honor, and vnderstandinge of the singular affec?on, wch his lp: by his Letter proffessed vnto the Plantation, they thought fitt to choose him of the Counsell, and to bestowe on his lp: 10 Shares of land old Aduenture wch by erec?on of hande? were confirmed hopinge that therevpon, he would affoord them his presence and assistance here, and perhapps the right to so much land might invite his lp: to the perticuler plant- inge of it, to the encrease and aduancement of the Colony. And forsomuch as Sr Iohn Brooke beside? his auncient Aduenture, had for a whole yeare frequented the Courte? and with his Counsell and other meanes bin assistant in all the Companies buissinesses duringe that time: The Court thought fitt to choose them of their Counsell wch by erec?on of hande? was confirmed. Mr Deputy ?further? acquainted the Company that mr George Ruggle lately fellowe of Clare hall in Cambridge beinge a Brother of the Company and newly deceased (wch he said he could not without great greife men?on) had by his will bequeathed 100li for the educa?on of Infidelle? Children wch he had caused to be put vpp into the Table: wch the Court well approued of; but seemed (at least the most part) to be vtterly ignorant of the person or qualities of the man: Where- vpon desiringe to be informed of both; mr Deputy told them that he was a man [87] second to none in knowledge of all manner of humanity, learninge, and was so generally reputed in the Vniuersity of singuler honestie and integritie of life, sincere and zealous in Religion, and of verie great wisdome and vnderstandinge: All wch good parte? he had for these last three yeares, wholly almost spent and exercised in Virginia buissinesses, hauinge (beside? continually assist- inge his Brothers and himself with Counsell and all manner of helpe in their places) written sundrie treatises, for the benifitt of the Plan- tation and in ?ticuler that worke so highly co?ended by Sr Edwin Sandys, concerninge the Gouermt of Virginia but such was his mod- estie that he would by no meanes suffer it to be knowne duringe his life: But nowe beinge dead, mr Deputy said he could not with a good conscience, depriue him of that Honor wch he so duely deserued. Mr Deputy moued the Court that whereas from his Matie and the Lorde? of his most Honoble Priuy Counsell the Companie had receaued a graceous and fauourable Answeare touchinge the sendinge of 400 men out of the seuerall Sheires to Virginia in supplie of those that perished by the Infidells that the prosecutinge and followinge of that mo?on might be recomended to the Honoble Lorde? whose presence was in the Afternoone expected wch was thought verie reasonable necessarie and ordered.</field>

[88] After the readinge of the former Quarter Court, there was reade the Præparatiue Court and ye Court held this day in the morninge, and the seauen Patente? wch were then compared and approued of as also diuers other buissinesses proposed in the said Courte? were nowe put to the question and by a generall erec?on of hande? ratified and confirmed. The Ea: of Southampton acquainted the Court that he had that morn- ing receaued from the Lord Treasuror by Sr Arthur Ingram certaine ?posi?ons (concerninge the Contract) wch Sr Arthur Ingram certified by his letter that the Lord Treasuror would confirme and ratifie wch out any further varia?on at all, if the Companie would yeald therevnto. The Proposi?ons beinge read mr Deputy said that the difference of them nowe sent from these formerly propounded by the Companie was the cause that had so longe kept their ?ps in Counsell, and for the differences (after an exact pervsall,) they found them to be these (vizt:) that the 9th Article was left out, and two newe ones added wch in these newe Propositions were the eight and Tenth Article, whereof the first giuinge a Third yeare for the bringinge in of the 80000 wtt of Spanish Tobacco, in case it could not be conveniently donne in the two first was by their ?ps and all the Counsell conceaued to be a matter of advantage and benifitt, but the ?two? other were the thinge? that they were nowe to take into their considera?on: ffor the first wch was the 9th Article left out, concerninge the settinge of a rate and price vpon the Tobacco aswell for the Companie as the Retaylors, Sr Edwin Sandys said that the Lo: Treasuror did therefore leaue it out, because he thought it ?it is thought? needles at least the first part for settinge a price vponn the Companies Tobacco it beinge in their power to do what they would therein And for the rest that in case the price should be stinted in the Proclamation, it would not be in the Com- panies power afterwarde? to raise it wch hee esteemed might proue of so great da?age vnto them as if they knewe themselues they would no waye desire it: Against this it was obiected that the restrayninge of the imoderate prices of Tobacco by stintinge it at a reasonable rate would be of great reputa?on to the Companie; in reguard that thereby men should not haue the occasion so much as to wast their estate?: and further, that by stintinge it at a reasonable price, would cause that men would not so boldly adventure to steale it in, when the dan- ger and hazard was so great if they were taken, and the gaine could not be great though they escaped: And this the Companie Co?ittee in their first consulta?ons, had conceaued to be one of the mayne Stopps and barr to keepe out Spanish Tobacco: To wch it was replied that the prices could not be so lowe stinted, but with such a largenes as there would be lefte a verie great deale of aduantage to them, that could steale it in, wherefore that preuention would not in effect proue of that waight as was conceaued: And for the first obiection, it was said, that if the Companie from the first hand did sell at indifferent rate?, it was impossible for the Retaylors, for the Retaylors any longe time to sell at excessiue prices, for all men would after a short while fetch it of the Companies as it were at the Wellhead, if they found they were exacted vpon by the Retaylors. [89] It was moued by some that if it were not fitt the prices be stinted by the Proclamation, yet it might be agreed, that the Companies should haue a power to stint it from time to time as they pleased: but that was generally adiudged to be a thinge contrary to all the rate? of trad- inge and of equity, and such as no Retaylers would deale with the Companie vpon, for havinge the sole sale in their hande?, it was in their power to haue what they would of them, and if likewise it were in their power afterward to sett their prices, it would be in their handes at all times for their owne aduantage to vndoe them, neither was this Proposition thought to be sufficiently qualified by a mo?on wch some made, to restraine the altera?on of prices to two sett times of the yeare onely, wherefore after longe and serious debatinge of the point, it was put to the question and by hande? ordered, that that article as the Lord Treasuror desired should be cleane lefte out. ffor the second Proposi?on it was after much debate and reasoninge thought to be soe dangerous as the Companies might noe waye there- vnto agree, It beinge conceaued that estima?on of the da?age might be so great as might vtterly vndoe the Companies, wherefore it was thought most necessarie to desire a qualifica?on of that Proposition and to reduce the danger vnto some kinde of certainty if nothinge eles could be obtained: To wch intent the Ea: of Southampton was humbly requested by the Court together with Sr Edwin Sandys to treat with the Lo: Treasuror thereabout and to bringe it to such forme as might be tollerable; wch if it could be obtayned in any reasonable sort, the Companie seemed willinge to accept of it, And whereas nowe noth- inge could be concluded, the Court did transmitt the power of it fully ratifyinge and confirminge the bargaine and Contract vnto the Quar- ter Court for the Su?er Ilande? to be held the Wedensday after; wherevnto all the Aduenturers were likewise to be warned. And although in this pointe, the letter of the lawe lawe might in rigor seeme somewhat violated, yet the necessity beinge duely considered, and withall that the Su?er Ilande? Companie is equally engaged in the buissinesses and that all the perticuler Members thereof are of the Companie of Virginia; It was not thought or adiudged any vniustice or wronge by waye of consequence to conclude in a Su?er Ilande? Quarter Court the bargaine for the Virginia Companie, no more then it was for the Su?er Ilande? Companie to be included by waye of anticipa?on in the bargaine, that was at the last Virginia Quarter Court passed for both, and further it was ordered that a Virginia Court should be warned ?in? on ffriday beinge the Præparatiue Court for the Su?er Ilands, ?and? therein to take such further resolu?on as should be thought fitt. Capt: Martin moued the Court that for somuch as they would not graunt him that propor?on of land wch he pretended to be due vnto him (wch he said ought to be 500 acres for a share) they would rede- liuer vnto him his old Patent, The Court blaminge him much for his impertinences and obstinacy gaue him for his last and resolute Answeare that if he would accept of such a Patent as they could graunt, he should haue it with as [90] ample priuiledges as had bin graunted to the Ea: of Southampton or any other Aduenturer what- soeuer: But for his old Patent, it could not be redeliuered vnto him beinge voide not somuch by his last resigna?on, as by the Graunt it selfe. It was ordered that the Bookee? should haue the registringe of Pas- sengers names that goes to Virginia as also of the Contracte? between Masters and Seruante? that are sent thither. Mr Wrote moued, that in respect the Companies Suite with mr Wye hath nowe almost three yeares depended in the Admiralty, and he and mr Berblocke hauinge followed it with much ?all? care and diligence, and yet can haue no end of it that the Companie would thinke vpon some course that it might come to a Conclusion: Wherevpon the Court were humble Suitors vnto the Lo: Cauendish that he would in the Companies name moue the Iudge for a finall end this Terme.1 1 The decree given in December is referred to in List of Records, No. 379, Vol. I, page 161, ante.

This daye beinge the Præparatiue Court for the Su?er Ilands; after that the Su?er Ilande? Court had passed all the perticuler buissinesses that were to be considered of and come to the great matter, the Con- tract with his [91] Matie they thinkinge it most convenient to receaue the informa?on of what the Ea: of Southampton and Sr Edwin San- dys had donne concerninge the qualifica?on of the Proposition referred vnto them by the Virginia Quarter Court from them as in a Virginia Court desired that the Su?er Ilande? Court beinge suspended a Vir- ginia Court might begin wch accordingly was donn, the Ea: of South- ampton takinge the Chaire. And after a recapitula?on of all that had passed the Quarter Court, he presented ?the? eight Propositions qualified in manner followinge (vizt:) And it is desired that an indifferent Couenant be drawne vp by his Mats learned Counsell and the Counsell for Virginia and the Su?er Ilands, that in case an extraordinary charge shall haue bin laid vpon the said Varinaes Tobacco by the State of Spayne since the feast of St Michaell the Archangell last past (beinge the time since §whence§ this Contract is to haue begininge) or hereafter shall be laid duringe the time of three yeares from thence next ensuinge more then was at the said feast of St Michaell last past in such cases the Com- panies shalbe clearely discharged of their said Couenant of bringing in of Spanish Tobacco from the time the said extraordinary charge shalbe laide vntill it be reversed and after the reversinge thereof, the quantity of the best varinaes Tobacco wch shall then remayne vnbrought in of the said fowerscore thousand waight shalbe brought in within the compasse of the first three yeares wch shalbe or haue bin cleare from the said extraordinary charge to be computed from the bringinge of this Contract, and in case there appeare any prac- tise by the ?sd? Merchante? of Spayne or others by meanes whereof the said Companies cannot make their Prouisions of the said quanti- tie of the best varinaes Tobacco as they haue agreed vnto but to their excessiue charge; In such case the Companies not to be pressed vpon the said Couenant in extreamity, but to make his Matie such satisfac?on as shalbe iust and conscionable, but if by the practise and fraude, or negligence of the said Companies their factors or Deputies the said quantitie of 80000 waight of the best Varinaes Tobacco shall not be imported within the compasse of the said first three yeares, then the said Companies shalbe answeareable to his Matie for euery pound waight so wantinge of the said Varinaes Tobacco belonginge to his Mats Third after the rate of 10s, the pound waight. Wch beinge read the Ea: of Southampton acquainted them that although the worde? were drawne vp by Sr Edwin Sandys yet it was directly accordinge to their agreement with my Lo: Treasuror and that his lp: gaue them order so to sett it downe, and that (he said) was all and the best that they could obtaine, wherefore he willed the Companie would deliuer their minde? freely whither they would in this manner accept of the bargaine or noe: Wherevpon although there were some fewe exceptions taken at it, yet in the end the Court seemed to conceaue a necessity in concludinge the Bargaine for the mainetenance and vpholdinge of the Plantation and that hauinge yealded to so many thinge? certainely preiudiciall to him ?vnto them? in matter of proffitt it were not wisedome nowe to breake vpon feare of vncertaine dangers wch they might easily (by Gode? blessinge) through good care and proff prouidence ouercome: wherefore esteeminge of this bargaine [92] (as they were aduised by a noble and Honoble person) not as good meat well sawced but of a por?on necessarie for their health beinge willing (as his lp: said) deuorare molestiam of this bitter pill, they desired the Ea: of Southampton to put it to the question: Wherevpon the Article by erec?on of hande? was confirmed ?and approued? accordingly as it was read: After, of Bar wch his lp: said, that since nowe they were in such liklyhood to conclude the bargaine, himselfe and the rest of the Lorde? together with the Counsell and Co?ittee wch had mett vpon Tuesday before the Quarter Court, thought it most requisite to nominate some of the principall Officers who were to haue the orderinge and managing of this buissi- nes: wch beinge well chosen both for sufficiency and integrity, would giue much encouragement and content to both the Companies and Collonies and all others that had interest in this buissines, Herevpon the Lord Cauendish acquainted the Court that the Co?ittee thought that there was to be one chiefe man to gouerne and direct all, and that next vnder him, there should be a Deputy and then a Treasurer and next them 8: Co?ittees at the least beside? the Officers as for the places of Deputy and Treasuror although they were two distinct places and Offices, yet because they were afraide this yeare not to be able to raise such a sufficiencie of meanes as might be a iust reward to two such ?sons as were requisite for the ?formance of those seuerall places they thought it best to vnite them for this yeare and that the Treas- uror beside? the charge of that office should likewise be the Deputy to the Director, wch ?course? the Court seemed well to like of and there- vpon nominated Sr Edwin Sandys for Director, who very earnestly besought them to spare him, beinge vnexperienced in matter of mar- chandizinge and tradinge, of both wch that Officer would require exact knowledge, beside? he could not continually reside in Towne havinge a great family in the Country, and began nowe as he grewe old to waxe weake, and therefore purposed rather to withdrawe himselfe from buissinesses of the world then to engage himselfe further, But the Court not satisfied with his reasons earnestly pressed him (and in per- ticuler the Ea: of Southampton and the other Lorde?) not to refuse the place wherein he might do soe singuler seruice vnto the Planta- ?on, the whole welfare of which did almost depend vpon the good managinge of this buissines, wherevpon by a generall vote of the Court it beinge put to the question he was nominated to stand in elec- ?on for that place at the Quarter Court. Next the Court proceeded to the nomina?on of a Treasuror, for wch proposinge mr Iohn ffarrar he desired the Companie to consider what a burden of buissines they had already laid vpon him wch had made him to neglect his owne priuate estate, for almost these fower yeares together: All wch although the Court acknowledged yet they held him so fitt a man for that buissines ?as? that they would propose no other to be Treasuror, and therevpon beinge put to the question, he was by a generall erec?on of hande? nominated to stand in elec?on for the place of Treasuror, wherevnto at last he submitted himselfe As for the nominatinge of the Co?ittees and other Officers with the Salaries the Ea: of Southampton thought it most fitt to leaue it to the con- sidera?on of the Quarter Court on the next Wedensday. [93] Sr Iohn Brooke moued that in reguard Captaine Martin went away from the last Court so ill satisfied in his buissines, and had therevpon not spared to wronge some worthie members of this Companie verie well deservinge with his clamerous reporte?, in such a manner as if himselfe had bin so vsed he would neuer haue come to the Courte? againe without repara?on ?reparation?, that therefore there might be a meetinge on purpose to heare what he could saye for him- selfe, at wch meetinge he wished the mr of the Rolle? (vnto whome he was allied) might be also entreated to ?be? present: Wherevpon it was ordered that mr Deputy should giue notice to the Mr of the Rolle? that the Companie would be ready to attend his Honor about Capt: Martin, whensoeuer it should please him to appointe a meetinge. A request was made in the behalfe of one Iohn Waller an auncient Planter in Virginia that forasmuch as he paid in to Sr Tho: Smith 30li in Ianuary i606 as appeared by a Note vnder Sr Tho: Smiths hand (nowe presented in Court) that therefore the Companie would please to graunt him a ratable propor?on of land for his said aduenture, as also reforme the Printed booke, where he ?is? acknowledged to haue paid only 5li Wherevpon it was ordered that the Secretary should repaire to Sr Tho: Smith and shewe him the said Note, wch if Sr Tho: did acknowledge to be his hand, he should be allowed the propor?on of land due vnto him for his said money and be also rectified in the Booke.</field>

His lp: then signified vnto them, that accordinge to the request of the Quarter Court himselfe and Sr Edwin Sandys had obtayned of the Lord Treasuror a qualifica?on of the 8: Proposition; wch was the onely thinge left vnconcluded by the Virginia Companie, wch qualifica?on havinge bin presented to the Præparatiue Court for the Su?er Ilands and approued by them and likewise well approued of by the Virginia Court held the same daye; he had caused the Propositions agreed vpon to be presented to the Lord Treasuror, who had signed them with his hand wch his lp: shewed vnto the Court without any manner of altera?on in any thinge from that wch the Court desired onely hau- inge strooke out certen worde? in the seau?th ?Article? for some rea- sons as his lp: by his letter signified no waye importinge the Comp- anie nor the Contract, wch worde? the Court adiudginge not to be materiall nor of moment thought fitt therein to giue the Lord Treas- uror satisfac?on and the rather because the Lord Treasuror (as the Ea: of Southampton shewed them) had so willingly let the worde (Receaued) stand, wch the Companie had enterlyned after the worde (profitt) in the sixt Article for the better clearinge of the doubt they then made about it. Herevpon after some pause, the Court seeminge all well satisfied and contented and no obiec?on or scruple beinge made by any, the Ea: of Southampton said, that if they so desired, he would put both the eight Proposition as it was qualified and the whole Bargaine to the question wch the Court generally desired, and therevpon his lp: puttinge both to the question, the eight Article (as it was qualified) and the whole bargaine the same was ratified and confirmed with an vnanimous con- sent by a generall erec?on of hande? no one dissentinge. This beinge donne ?passed? the Ea: of Southampton said that since they had nowe concluded the Contract they were to take order for the good execu?on and performance thereof by the choise of able and faithfull Officers to manage the buissines with Salaries propor?onable in some measure for their paines ?and? by setlinge the whole buissines in a good course and frame, especially the bringinge in of the Span- ish Tobacco a pointe of great importance, and wch might not be delayed, nor could be concluded vpon, except on this daye wch was the Quarter Court for the Su?er Ilande? and had also the power of the Quarter Court for Virginia, Concerninge these thinge?, his lp: said, that himselfe together with the Lorde? then present, and the Counsell beinge assisted by the Co?ittee had spent all Tuseday both forenoone and afternoone in consulta?on and considera?on of these pointe? and their iudgmente? and opinions herein he would [95] nowe deliuer vnto the Court desiringe them likewise freely to deliuer their iudgemente? and opin- ions either for the approba?on or otherwise of what he should nowe propound vnto them, wch he said himselfe the Counsell and Co?ittees had taken into their considera?ons not with intent to conclude any- thinge nor to preiudice the Courte?, but ?only? the better to prepare the buissinesses for them esteeminge themselues as his lp: said as Servante? of the Court. ffor the first therefore his lp: said, that accordingly as was propounded formerly and in the Præparatiue Court, they conceaued there was to be one principall Officers by the name of a Director vpon whome the whole successe of the buissines almost depended. Next vnto him was to be the Deputy, for without one it was impos- sible that the Director should be able to vndergoe all those buissi- nesses, that should be requisite to this ?wch? office they conceaued there did belonge an extraordinary deale of paines and noe smale sufficiency. The third officer was the Treasuror for keepinge of the Cash, then they conceaued it necessarie to haue at the least eight Co?ittees for the sellinge and disposinge of their Tobaccoes, and for the assistinge of the Director with their Counselle? and helpes in the seuerall parte? and Ac?ons of the buissines, wch were verie many and exceedinge waightie and important. Next a Bookeeper for keepinge of Accounte? a man of Skill and in- dustrie. They conceaued it likewise necessarie that there should be two Cash- eires whereof one to be a verie sufficient and substantiall man, who was to be continually resident in the Treasurie, the other a person of fidelity for the receauinge and gatheringe in of moneyes here in Towne or otherwise. ffurther they conceaued ?thought? it necessarie to haue a Clarke at all times to attend the Co?ittees and to be continually at the Directors hand, who should haue howerly vse of such a one, wherefore they thought fitt, he should be the Directors howshold Servant. They conceaued it likewise most necessary to allowe the Deputy a Clarke to whose place there would belonge an exceedinge great deale of writinge. It was also conceaued fitt to haue a Solicitor for followinge of Suite? of lawe many whereof were like to arise. ffor takinge vp and receauinge of goodes, there was likewise to be a Husband to whome (with the allowance of one vnder him) the Cus- todie of the Warehowse should be co?itted. It was thought also most necessarie to haue a Beadle. Other inferior Officers, his lp: said the Comittee thought not fitt to meddle with, but (beinge thinge? of smale moment) to leaue the con- sidera?on of them to the Director and Co?ittees and the choise of them to ordinary Courte?. [96] And for the meetinge of all these Officers and ?sons ?formance of their seuerall places and Offices, his lp: said it was thought absolute necessary that the Companie should take a howse. These his lp: said were the Offices wch the Councell and Comittees thought necessary for the ?forminge and executinge of this buissines and of whome they conceaued it necessarie to make a choise at this Court, desiringe the Courte? iudgement and opinion therein and withall acquaint them, that although the places of Deputy and Treasuror were two distinct Offices in themselues and would require therefore two persons, yet after a serious considera?on thereabout (desirous to hus- band the expences to the best this yeare) they conceaued it best, (accordinge to the resolu?on of the Præparatiue Court) to ioyne them both in one. The Court after some pause and delibera?on seeme verie well to like and approue of the thinge? wch his lp: had propounded without excep- tion or altera?on of any thinge. Wherevpon his lp: seeinge them satisfied in these thinge? said he would proceed and declare vnto them what Sallaries and rewarde? were by himselfe and the rest vpon mature delibera?on thought some thinge propor?onable vnto the paines and charge that the Officers before men?oned were to take. He said that first they conceaued the Director would deserue verie well this yeare 500li — — The Treasuror who is to supplie the place of Deputy for this yeare yeare 400li — — The eight Co?ittees 5011 a peece 400li The booke? 80li1 1 The copyist first wrote 400, but struck out the 4 and altered the first cypher to an 8. The Clarke for the Co?ittees 30li To two Casheers and Clarke for the Deputy 150li Solicitor 30li The Warehowskeeper who also might be the Husband for the Companies, and in reguard of this addi?on of wages should abate 20li of that Salary he had from them, his paines in those places not beinge so great as it was wont to be 60li The Beadle 30 The inferior Officers 140li ffor a howse and Warehowses 180 So that the charge of the howse and Officers amounts to 2000 [97] wch his lp: said in their opinions was to be raised vpon the Tobacco And further conceaued it fitt there should be 500li more for ?all? other extraordinary occasion wch might arise, wch if it were not by consent and order of the Courte? expended for the advantage and improuement of the price of Tobacco should be repaid againe to euery man proporconably: His lp: said likewise that in raisinge of the charge it was conceaued fitt by the Counsell and Co?ittees and agreed vnto by diuers (who meant to be Aduenturers herein) that the Spanish Tobacco should beare a double rate in charges to that of the Virginia and Su?er Ilande?, wch would be an extraordinary great ease and advantage vnto the Planta?ons So that howsoeuer this So?e might seeme great of 2500li wch was to be gathered, yet consideringe that 500li was not to be expended, except for the aduantage of the Companie and of that of the 2,000li remayning his Matie beare one Third, and the Spanish Tobacco a propor?on double to the rest, they conceaued it to be noe great burden: but such as in the aduancement of the price, by their care and paines would be manifoldly repaid, As for the paines care and charge of the Officers himself and all the rest of the Counsell conceaued it would be farr aboue their Salaries and rewarde?. The Ea: of Southampton hauinge thus deliuered the matter, there was a generall silence in the Court: Wherevpon after a longe pause, his lp: desired the Court, that they would freely speake their minde? concerninge these thinge? an declare what and howe they would haue them donn, sayinge againe that himselfe and the Comittees had not consulted and aduised of these thinge? to conclude or determine any- thinge, but onely as their Servante? to prepare them to their consider- a?on, in whome only was the power and authority to determine and conclude matters: he therefore earnestly desired them without any respect of himselfe or the rest (from whome these proposi?ons came) to declare their minde? freely concerninge the pointe of the Salaries. Herevpon mr Robert Smith the Vndercha?berlen said he thought there were diuers gentlemen and other sufficient men that for con- science sake would doe the buissines for farr lesser rewarde?. To wch Sr Edward Sackuill made Answeare, that for his part he did thinke men bound in conscience to giue them whome they did imploye some reasonable satisfac?on for their labor and paines, And that he would neuer wish that these kinde of buissinesses wch concerned mens proffitt should be donn without reward somethinge answeare- able havinge found by experience that some that had for conscience sake serued this Companie had for conscience sake vndonn it. [98] The Ea: of Southampton said that mr Robert Smith was a verie hon- est man, and he thanked him for speakinge his minde freely desiringe others would doe the like. Mr Deputy said that although he might be thought interessed or par- tiall to those two ?sons vnto §vpon§ whome the two great Salaries wch onely could be excepted against were like to fall, yet havinge a single heart free from all priuate ende?, he durst affirme that the rewarde? were so farr short of the paines care and travell and charge that they should vndergoe that but for conscience sake and the good of ye Plantations neither would he ?swade nor he was assured would they accept of the Offices: But mr Barker said that havinge followed these Courte? many yeares he had neuer heard of so great Salaries, as 5 and 400li for an Office, but had heard of 500li and 1000li wantinge in some Accounte? by them who did buissinesses for nothinge. Mr Ditchfeild said that this was like to be a hard yeare and of the least proffitt, and because perhapps there would not be so great a quantity of Tobacco brought in, there would be ?require the? lesse trouble and paines, and therefore he wished that the Salaries might be easier. To wch the Ea: of Southampton made Answeare that for the first part he was of his opinion that it would be a yeare of the least benifitt, but for the second part, he thought cleane contrary that the trouble of this yeare would be farr more then any of the succeedinge, in reguard of the great difficulties that are in the setlinge of newe buissinesses more then in prosecutinge of them, when they are once ordered and setled in good frame and course. After this no man makinge further obiec?on and many approuinge and well likinge the propor?on of Salaries and desiringe his lp: to put them to the question, his lp: said he would once againe read them vnto, wch beinge ?hauing? donn and no man makinge any obiec?on after a good pause his lp: put all those thinge? formerly proposed con- cerninge the Officers and Salaries to the question: All wch were by erec?on of hande? approued of and confirmed. This beinge ended the Ea: of Southampton desired them to nominate whome they would haue to be their Director and Treasuror (wch were to be ballated) the rest were thought fitt should be chosen by erec?on of hand?. Wherevpon for Director was nominated Sr Edwin Sandys and for Treasuror and Deputy mr Iohn ffarrar, and no other beinge named Sr Edwin Sandys was first put to the ballatinge Box and was chosen by 65 ball? and had only fiue ball? against him. [99] Afterward mr Iohn ffarrar beinge put to the Ballatinge Boxe for Treasuror and Deputy, was chosen by 68: ball? havinge only two Ball? against him. After this the Court named for Co?ittees. mr Bennett. mr Ditchfeild. mr Barbor. mr Bland. mr Caswell. mr Wiseman. mr Wheatly. mr Meuerell. mr Gifford. mr Edward?. mr Withers. mr Couell. mr Mellinge. mr ffelgate. mr Geo: Smith. mr Bull. wch beinge put to the question erec?on of hand? these eight by plurality of hand? were chosen mr Bennett. mr Barbor. mr Caswell. mr Wheatley. mr Gifford. mr Withers. mr Mellinge. mr Geo: Smith. Vnto wch Co?ittee for their better assistance by reason many waightie occurrances would happen of higher nature then proffitt, his lp signi- fied that the Counsell and former Co?ittee at their last consulta?ons held it likewise fitt there should be an addi?on of eight or ten more without Salaries as Co?ittees extraordinary to be chosen out of the Counsell, Notwithstandinge it was propounded ?prouided? and ordered that the Director and the rest of ye Co?ittees both ordinary and extra- ordinary shall not haue any concludinge power in any matter of waight touchinge this buissines without the opinion and assent of the two Companies in their seuerall Court? who are to be made acquainted from time to time with their proceeding?: Wherevpon for Co?ittees ?extraordinary? the Court nominated the right honoble Lo: Padgett. Sr Hen: Mildmay. Lo: Maynard. mr Gibbs. Sr Ed: Sackuill. mr Wrote. Sr Io: Brooke. mr Io: Smith. Sr Io: Dãuers. mr Ro: Smith. ffor Bookeeper mr Wiseman and mr Boothby beinge proposed choise was made of mr Wiseman by plurality of hand?. The two Casheires and Clark? were left to the choise of the Treasuror beinge to be answeareable for them. ffor the Solicitor, mr Waterhowse and mr Hacket beinge proposed choise was made of mr Waterhowse. [100] ffor Husband mr Webb was thought fittest, in reguard the Company haue litle other imployment for him; And in respect he is allowed 60li for this buissines, the Companie to ease their hand deducted 20li of that they formerly allowed him. ffor Beadle choise was made of mr Carter. After this vpon mo?on that a Co?ittee might be appointed for draw- inge vp the oathes for their seuerall Officers aforenamed the Court referred it to be donne by mr Nicholas ffarrar and the former Co?ittee extraordinary, who were entreated to meete at mr Deputies on Sat- turday next in the afternoone to aduise about the same. After this mr Deputy acquainted the Company ?Court? that the Coun- sell and Co?ittee hauinge treated and debated largely concerninge the bringinge in of the Spanish Tobacco, and findinge some willinge to be Aduenturers for the bringinge in of 40000 waight, thought good findinge no possibility to haue the whole vndertaken, at present to make offer and to giue liberty to such as would vnderwrite for the bringinge in of that quantitie vpon such condi?ons as partly the Court? had ordered and the Comittee appointed by the Virginia Companie in their Præpara- tiue Court for that purpose, had likewise thought fitt, And that the Counsell and Co?ittee hauinge appointed some him to drawe vp a Roll to that purpose he had accordingly donne it, wch the Counsell had before the sittinge of the Court read and approued and he nowe pre- sented it vnto the Court to receaue their approba?on or amendment, wch beinge donne and the Court fully informed of the perticular point? therein, it was put to the question and by erec?on of hand? ratified and confirmed the Tenor whereof followeth (vizt). The Co?ittee were desired by the Court to take care to looke out for a convenient howse and Warehowse for the Companies vse. Rolle: The Co?ittees also apointed heretofore to attend mr Atturney about drawinge vp of the Patent were nowe desired to proceed in that buis- sines with expidi?on. Mr Iohn ffarrar desired a Co?ission might be graunted for the Bona Noua, wch he and his Partners were settinge forth aswell for trans- portinge of some ?sons to Virginia as also for fishinge in part for the Colony wch was accordingly graunted, and mr Deputy desired to drawe vp the Co?ission and to Seale it. The like Co?ission at the mo?on and request of mr Bennet was also graunted for the Iohn &amp; Frauncis. [101] After the endinge of the Virginia Court the Lo: Cauendish tooke againe the Chaire and so the Su?er Ilands Court went on, when his lp: recapitulatinge orderly and distinctly all the seuerall thing?, that had bin propounded, debated and passed, in the Virginia Court belong- inge to the Contract, desired the Su?er Ilands Companie to declare their mind? and opinions concerninge the same, wch they did by a generall assent, approvinge of all thing? without any manner of excep- tion to any thinge at all, And generally desired his lp: to put the thinge to the question wch accordingly his lp: did and the whole Con- tract, and all the perticulars thereof were by erec?on of hand? ratified and confirmed in all point? accordingly as the Virginia Companie had passed them. The Security for such as stood bound for the 1000li taken vp at vse is transmitted to the next Court to be further considered of and then the Seale of the Companie to be affixed vnto it. Vpon the Dissoluinge of the Court?, the Ea of Southampton and the Lord Cauendish stood vp and both of them prayinge God that this buissines might be to the aduancement of the Planta?ons (to wch only they protested they had respect in all the carriage thereof) desired the whole Companie nowe to make their best of that wch themselues had concluded and like honest and worthie minded men to giue their best helpes for the good execu?on thereof, and to ioyne with sincere hands ?hart?? and willinge hand? in the good accomplishinge and ?formance thereof.</field>

At the great and generall Quarter Court accordinge to the vsuall manner was first read the preceedent quarter Court held in Iuly last and nex next the Preparatiue Cort held on ffriday the 22th of this present Moneth after this was first read the Draft of the Graunt of Land? in the Su?er Iland? to perticular Aduenturers wch was by the last preparatiue Court referred to this Quarter Cort to be confirmed, or otherwise amended or altered as this Court should thinke fitt: Against it were alledged all those Argunent? that were vsed in the former Court, but they were not founde to be of any more force or validity then they then appeared, but on the contrary the said Inden- ture both for the forme and the ?ticuler point? in it, appeared to be more fitt and necessarie the more it was Disputed and Debated of, but whereas some seemed to make a newe scruple that by the said ?third? Article their good? here at home were lyable to the satisfyinge of such charges as by the Companie should be taxed for the Defence of the Iland or otherwise, Although it was conceaued and generally adiudged that the word? of the Article did not import any such thinge but were onely restrained to such good? and Co?odities as should come from the So?er Iland? only yet to giue full satisfac?on ?vnto them? It was ordered that the word? should be made more plaine in this manner vizt. That whereas it was before in these word? vizt: vpon the good? and proffitt? of the said A B his heires and Assignes or vpon the good? and proffitt? of his and their Tenant? and Servant? wch shalbe brought from the said Sumer Iland? into any of his Mats Dominions or els- where: It was ordered to be in this manner vizt vpon the good? and proffitt? of the said A B: his heires and Assignes wch shalbe brought from the said Su?er Ilands or vpon the good? and proffitt? of his and their Tenant? and Servant? wch shall likewise be brought from the said Su?er Iland? into any of his Mats Dominions or elswhere. And in the end after a verie longe disputa?on and full and ample discussinge of all point? the Lo: Cauendish propounded whither [103] the Indenture should passe or noe wch beinge put to the question the number seeminge to be equall on both part?, it was thought fitt to diuide the Court, and that they that were on ye affirmatiue part to be of the one side and the Negatiue on the other, wch beinge donn there was found to be on the affirmatiue part wch desired the Indenture should passe these 21 followinge vizt Lo: Cauendish Gouernor. mr Bromefeild. mr Cuffe.

And fower others. So that the thinge was confirmed and ratified. This buissines beinge dispatched the Lo: Cauendish Gouernor pro- posed the accomplishinge of the great worke of the daye wch was the concludinge of the Contract with his Matie and the performinge those other thing? wch were necessarie for the accomplishment &amp; execu?on thereof, as namely the choise of Officers, their Salaries and other thing? pertinent thereto, But because the thinge did equally con- cerne the Virginia Companie with the Su?er Ilands, and that all of the Su?er Ilands Companie, were of the Virginia Companie, but not on the contrary: It was therefore thought fitt and convenient that accordinge to the power and authoritie giuen by the Quarter Court for Virginia the Wednesday before all those point? should be first pro- pounded Debated and passed in a Virginia Court and afterward in the Sumer Iland? Court by wch course both the buissines might be more exactly determined of, in reguard that from the greater number there was like to be the better Counsell giuen and likewise a labor spared for if they should begin with it in the Sumer Iland? Court all thing? must be againe repeated to the Virginia Court afterward, for wch the day would scarce suffice: wherevpon it was ordered that the Sumer Ilands Cort should be suspended for a while but to be continued so longe after 6, of ye Clocke as occasion should require and the Ea: of Southampton was desired to take the Chaire and to begin a Virginia Court wch accordingly his lp: did. ?wch Court is entred next before this bearing date the same day.?

      <field name="fulltext">At a Court held for Virginia on Wedensday the 4th of December i622 Present Right Honoble Lo: Cauindish Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Bromefeild. mr White.

Mr Deputy said that for want of leasure he had not ?fected the last Court kept on the Su?er Ilands Quarter Court day, Wherefore he desired the readinge thereof might be respited till the next Court. Mr Deputy moued the Court for passinge of these Shares followinge vizt for three Shares wch himselfe had bought of mr Edw. ffaucett and turned ouer to mr Geo: Mordent, wch beinge allowed by the Auditors the Court ratified and confirmed accordingly, Also for two Shares wch Henry Lo: Lawarr ?and the Lady Cisly Laware? passed ouer vnto mr Nicho: Downe Cittizen and mercer of London wch the Court in like manner confirmed vnto the said Nicho: Downe. After this the Quarter Court held the two and Twentith of Nouember last was read. Captaine Martin moued the Court for redeliuery of his Patent pre- tendinge it was onely deposited in the Secretaries hand? vpon trust but the Court answeared, that the surrender was voluntary and abso- lute without any manner of condi?on, but onely to haue a newe Pat- ent and therefore could not be deliuered him againe, wondringe that against so many wittnesses to the contrary he would affirme any such thinge: Wherevpon he beinge further desirous the Mr of the Roll? might be entreated to giue a meetinge about his buissines according to a former order in that behalfe, The Court praied mr Deputy accord- inge to the said order to repaire vnto the Mr of the Roll? to knowe what time he would please to appoint a meetinge, and that if it might stand with his Honors leasure on Monday next a Court should be then called on purpose for that buissines onely. Sr Edwin Sandys said that forsomuch as it was ordered at the last Court that the Co?ittee appointed for the Tobacco buissines should from time to time make report vnto the Companie of their proceed- ing? in those affaires he would therefore relate in perticuler what had bin donn therein by them: ffirst that the Lord Treasuror had receaued [105] the Propositions as they were agreed on at the last Court, and had promised to giue direc?ons to mr Atturney imediatly to drawe vp the Patent accordingly: But his lps sodaine goeinge to Newmarkett to the Kinge, had caused that to be forgotten, notwith- standinge mr Atturney beinge made acquainted with the Contract, said, although he had as yet receaued no direc?on from the Lo: Tr?ar, yet for expidi?ons sake he would prepare the buissines against his lps returne. Hee further signified that because of the Delay of the Proclamation, might not breed any preiudice to the Companies, the Co?ittees had accordingly as the Lord Treasuror by Sr Arthur Ingram aduised them, drawne vp the forme of a Letter to be sent to the Port? in his Lps name, giuinge notice of the Bargaine concluded between his Matie and the Companies and straightly charginge them to inhibite the bring- inge in of any Tobacco but accordingly: wch letter was deliuered to Sr Arthur Ingram who promised to procure his lp: to signe it withall expidition if it were not already donn, and to cause it to be sent downe imediately. As for the Proclama?on he said himselfe and the Co?ittees conceau- inge there was great necessity in speedinge of it, had satt many dayes in pervsinge all former President? of this and many of the like kinde, and out of them collectinge what they conceaued to be fitt and prop per, and likewise addinge diuers other perticulers, wch were conceaued either necessary or benificiall they had drawne a Proclama?on whereby mr Atturney might wth lesse labor and in shorter time dispatch it: Wch vpon his lps returne from Newmarkett they hoped would be instantly effected. Hee further signified, that for bringinge home of the Spanish Tobacco, the Roll agreed vpon in the Quarter Court was engrossed, and there was already by his Solicita?on vnderwritt a good So?e of money neare vpon 2500li. And whereas it was ordered at the last Quarter Court, that such as beinge not free Brothers of the Companie and yet desired to aduen- ture in this Iointe Stocke should first buy fower Shares of land of the Companie, he wished it had bin ordered for a lesse number of Shares for that he knewe some worthie gentlemen would §willingly§ haue vnderwritt in the said Roll, if they might haue bin admitted vpon the purchase of two Shares onely, but he said he spake this onely ?but? by the waye. Herevpon mr Wrote tooke occasion to saye that he sawe no reason why they should be so strictly bound to those orders as if those orders were like to the lawes of the Meades and Persians neuer to be altered or revoaked Besid? he said that this order had not his due comitt- ment (as it ought to [106] haue had by their lawes) for he said him- selfe was the first Proposer of it, wch was no sooner moued but it was forthwith ordered, And therefore said, he wold nowe moue and pro- pound vnto this Cort that in reguard not onely that perticuler order but also some other matters of speciall consequence vnto the Com- panie were proposed and passed at the last Court held for Virginia on the Sumer Ilands Quarter Court daye without that due prepara?on as the lawes and orders of the Companie required in that §like§ cases, that therefore it might nowe be ordered that no Acte hereafter be made to binde the Companie in the same Court wherein the matter is first proposed but rather that it might ruñ his due course of examina- ?on by a Co?ittee or in the followinge ordinary Court before it be ordered; for he said he had obserued an Article passed in this Roll (amonge other thing?) whereat many tooke exception, and was the only cause of their vnwillingnes to vnderwrite to the said ?Roll? wch otherwise would haue aduentured largely in this buissines, as namely where the Companie are ordered to beare a Tenth part in the said Iointe Stocke, and to giue their Seale for Security, whereby it was conceaued that if the buissines should not prosper well, euery mans priuate estate was bound to repaire the losse and make vp the Kings part: And he added the Companie beinge in debt, the moneyes paid in to the Companies by such as subscribed might be presently seized vpon accordinge to the Custome to the Citty whereby the Companie should paye vse for the Stocke and not haue the same to imploy to any benefitt. Touchinge the first pointe of mr Wrotes Allega?on Sr Edwin Sandys answeared that there was a very great difference between a lawe wch ought to be made in that solemne manner as he had intimated, and a perticuler buissines as this is was. Mr Deputy said he would not propound the co?ittinge of these thing? againe, beinge determined by the Quarter Court neither did he con- ceaue any defect to haue bin in the manner of passinge them, for although mr Wrote was he that propounded it yet it was not a thinge then sodainely thought vpon, but propounded by mr Deputy himselfe to diuers of the Counsell fower or fiue dayes before, neither was it passed that Court wherein it was propounded without mature delib- era?on, and was againe read and approued by the Quarter Court ?for? Virginia, and after that againe in the last Court wch had the authority of a Quarter Court ratified and approued Wherevpon mr Withers said he sawe no reason that a thinge being clearely passed in a Court and without any exception confirmed in two other Court? should either be disputed or called in question. [107] And it was by another added that no Co?ittees opinion could be deemed of so much force as the opinion of a generall Court if it passe clearely. ffor the second point of mr Wrotes former speach vizt vpon the Com- panies bearinge a Tenth part in the Aduenture, Sr Edwin Sandys said that the Counsell and Co?ittees had taken that waightie pointe into their serious considera?on, and they were of opinion that it was most necessary to engage the Companie in this Iointe Stocke for bringinge home the Spanish Tobacco, for that thereby the Aduen- turers should haue the Companies assistance and protec?on vpon all occasions (as need should require) And that this condi?on was desired by the Aduenturers themselues, who without it would not haue vnderwritten in the said Roll; As for the matter of Security (Wch was so much stood vpon) he said the Tobacco it selfe, aswell as the Seale of the Companie should lye at Stake for it. And touchinge the engagement of mens private estat? hereby: therein was no danger; it beinge cleare by lawe that onely the good? of the Corporation are lyable to the debt? thereof, Concerninge wch he said he had taken aduise of most sufficient Lawyers: And mr Caswell said, that mr White the Lawyer (who newly was departed out of the Court) havinge heard this Disputa?on did affirme that priuate mens estat? could not be lyable to the Debt? by the Seale of the Corpora?on but onely the good? of the Corpora?on it selfe. Notwithstandinge mr Wrote still persisted in his former opinion, that this buissines was not fairely carried nor a due course taken for pre- paringe of matters; but were hastily shuffled ouer, and that he could not be ?swaded but each Member of the Companie (vpon grant of the Seale for Securytie) was bound to make this good, out of his owne private estate, alledginge that he had likewise asked Counsell of Law- yers whose iudgement was as he had deliuered. ?And was the rather confirmed in that opinion because of the late example of the Muscouy Company.? Wherevpon mr Alderman Iohnson desired the Companie to be wary in giuinge their Seale for the Security and therevpon cited a case of late time happned vnto the Muscouia Companie who beinge indebted longe since and hauinge giuen their Seale for Security diuers Brothers of that Companie were troubled and sued for the same: Mr Mellinge replied it was true that a levia?on for payment of the Muscouia Companies debt? was ordered by the Lord? of his Mats most honorable Privy Counsell to be made out of the gaines made vpon their seuerall Stock? in the seuerall yeares when those moneyes were supposed to be borrowed and taken vp at interest and not to be laid vpon the whole body of the Companye or them that were not Traders in those yeares or since. [108] But mr Withers made Aunsweare it was true some were troubled but none of them had therefore paid any thinge, but were freed and cleared thereof: And he added further that the newe Iointe Stocke it selfe was exempted from those former debt?: wch mr Alderman Iohnson said was by perticuler agreement before the Stocke was beguñ: Howso- euer mr Withers said he was suer that the priuate Brothers of the Companie were by order of the Counsell-Bourd acquitted and freed from molesta?on. Mr Deputy said that besid? the vnseasonablenes of the Proposition since it could not be revoaked at least till the next Quarter Court the thinge it selfe seemed verie strange to him, for if their were danger to priuate mens estat? by reason the Companies beare a Tenth part only; howe much greater danger there was, if the Companie should beare the whole wch they were bound to doe hauinge taken it vpon them by giuinge of their Seale except priuate Aduenturers as they had beguñ eased them: Wherevpon he said the Counsell and Co?ittees conceaued that they had donn a verie espeaciall great Seruice to the Companie so to continue and order the matter: That hauinge taken so great a bur- then vpon them, they should be eased of almost all, and the care of one onely Tenth part left vnto them: And if the feare of this Tenth part did trouble men what should the whole doe, wch otherwise was like to lye vpon the Companies: ffor whereas mr Wrote said, that this Clause was the onely cause of the vnwillingnes of diuers to vnderwrite in the said Roll wch otherwise would haue aduentured largely in the buissines, mr Deputy said it was a principall clause that invited them that had already vnderwritten and that ?when? it was replied that if the Companies had not §a part§ there was one would vnderwrite 500li mr Deputy made aunsweare that if the Companies had not a part the 2500li already vnderwritten would vpon his knowledge be drawne out againe; And diuers of them that had vnwritten, beinge then present did affirme the same, that except the Companies bore a part they would withdrawe what they had already vnderwritten. Vpon this disputa?on the Lord Cauendish tooke occasion to informe the Court howe fairely and orderly the Counsell and Co?ittee had proceeded in this buissines: The Lord? and the Counsell ?sittinge? both forenoone and afternoone the day before the Quarter Court beinge attended also by the Co?ittees the whole day, and that thing? were so seriously and maturely debated as there growinge a difference of opin- ion in one pointe amongst the Co?ittee ?Counsell?, the Ea: of South- ampton did perticulerly enquire the opinion of euery one and in the end the resolu?on was made accordinge to the maior part of voices. [109] Mr Wrote said that he knewe many eyes were vpon him and desired the speeches he had spoken might be sett downe. Wherevpon the Argument beinge still maintayned with such violence and vnorderlynes against so many good reasons as had bin alledged, mr Deputy made this open protesta?on that for his part in reguard he had knowne mr Wrotes great zeale and forwardnes in the buissines of Virginia, he did not thinke that these thing? were propounded and vrged by him out of an evill minde, nor that they came from him- selfe, but from some others who had by wronge informa?ons and ground? perswaded him to doe what he did, directly with an inten- tion to cause distrac?on and variances and by iealousies and doubt? to hinder the vnderwritinge of the Roll and consequently to drawe the Companie into the Penalty of not performinge that condi?on, wch if any such evill happned he protested this dayes worke was the cheife occasion: Wherevnto mr Wrote made answeare that he would not haue mr Deputy thinke so: basely of him as to be so lead by any man, for he protested it was his owne what he spake and not out of any suggestion vnto him: And therevpon vrged againe that mr Dep- uty would put his former Proposition to the question: wch if he refused he said the Counsell there ??sent? were to doe it. Wherevpon mr Deputy asked him howe he would haue it put to the question, Whither that noe order should be made before it had bin considered of by a Co?ittee (Wch could not but breed a great deale of trouble and vnnecessary delaye to buissinesses) ?or? whither he would haue matters of importance onely to be so referred wch already had bin the practise of the Companie in ?all? their proceeding?: Wherevpon the Court beinge ouerwearied and mr Wrote ?being? told by Diuers he did transgresse the lawe by speakinge so often to one buissines, replied that others had so donne likewise, and he would yet speake more, At length to giue an end to these differences, the Court desired mr Deputy to put it to ye question whither the openinge of the fower Shares to a lesse number and the Companies bearinge a Tenth part in the Iointe Stocke beinge thing? ordered by the last Quarter Court, should be nowe disputed vpon or noe, wch beinge accordingly put to the question it was by a generall consent, (only mr Wrote himselfe and one other dissentinge) ordered, that seinge both those point? had passed the iudgement of a Quarter Court, they should not nowe be disputed vpon, but if any had any thinge to oppose there against they might doe it in the next: Quarter Court. This beinge donne the Lord Cauendish acquainted the Companie, yt according to the request of the former Court he had bin with Sr Henry Martin and Solicited him for a hearinge of the cause in difference between one Wye and the Companie who promised to appoint a daye on purpose between this and Christmas to make an end of that buissines. [110] Mr Wrote herevpon made request vnto the Companie that seeinge he had a longe time followed this buissines and that the cause at the next hearing after sentence giuen and vpon Appeale made was like to ?be? transmitted to the Delegat? whereby it must anewe begin that therefore himselfe might be discharged and some other appointed to solicite and followe the same before the Deligat?, for it was nowe no worke of a gentlemans but of a Solicitor. After this it beinge late a letter was presented in Court to mr Deputy directed to the Treasuror Counsell and Company for Virginia and Sub- scribed by Henry Reynolds wch beinge read it appeared he made request in the behalfe of one mr Taylor, whome he co?ended for his honestie and sufficiency that the Companie would please to imploye him for their factor in Ireland about the Tobacco buissines with such convenient Salary for his paines as shalbe thought fitt: wch request beinge taken into considera?on some of the Court thought fitt to referr it to the Co?ittees as also what Salary they shall thinke fitt to allowe him for his seruice. But Sr Edwin Sandys moued, that no Salary might be graunted but by the Court? approba?on. Herevpon mr Wrote tooke occasion to admonish the Companie to take some tender care in giuinge of Salaries and wished that the Graunt of so great Salaryes at the last deriuatiue Court had bin better con- sidered of before they had passed thereon them consideringe the Companie were in debt already, and so litle meanes left whereby to raise so great a So?e as 2500li (as was nowe agreed vpon) to be issued out in Salaries and other charges and consideringe also this was a course contrary to the practise of the East Indy Companie who graunted to their Officers no Sallaries at all vntill there was both meanes to do it and seruice also ?formed for it: And said further that whereas vpon the grauntinge of the place of Maisterp of the ordi- nance in Virginia heretofore vnto Captaine Martin with the like ffees and Proffitts as are accustomed to the like place here in England, Sr Edwin Sandys opposed the said Patent for that it would haue brought a greater charge vpon the Companie then would be paide beinge not- withstandinge but 400li ? An?, Hee therefore could not see (espea- cially nowe the Company were in a farr worse case) by what meanes, so great a So?e as 2500li a yeare could be paide without the vtter vndoinge of the Companie: ffor he said this great So?e must of necessity be raised by ann imposi?on vpon the Tobacco that shalbe brought in, wch he obserued to be of three sort?, vizt: the Spanish Tobacco, The Companies Tobacco and the Tobacco of priuate Planters wch ought to be free by their Charters, So that what with givinge a Third part to his Matie and payinge of other charges for custome, freight and for this newe Imposi?on, the poore Planter should scarce haue the one halfe of his Tobacco free to himselfe to liue vpon And herevpon mr Wrote [111] offered to giue the one halfe of all his Tobacco to be quitt of all charges that would come vpon it by this meanes: Wherevpon some made Answeare that he went about to call the whole Contract into question, and to laye disgraces vpon it wch was past and fully agreed on by both the Quarter Court?; Whereas the bringinge of the Tobacco into one hand was vndoubtedly the waye both to vphold and aduance the price much more ?then? by beinge brought in, and scattered ?in? many hundred hand?.1 1 A paper touching a similar discussion in the Summer Islands Company is referred to in List of Records, No. 390, Vol. I, page 162, ante. Mr Wrote replied he ment onely touchinge the Salaries wch buissines (he said) was not co?itted but carried fowly and disorderly and with much arte surreptitiously and to priuate end?; And that diuers of the Companie did both then and since, as well publiquely, as privately in his hearinge complaine much against it, but durst not speake their mind? freely because they were ouerawed. Mr Withers recalled him, sayinge he was much mistaken to saye thing? were carried fowly: And mr Treasuror Caswell said, you would not haue said wee were ouerawed if you had bin at Court, you should haue seen what wee durst do: But mr Alderman Iohnson interrupted him sayinge they had Salaries and ought not to speake. Wherevpon mr Iohn ffarrar said that that speach of mr Wrote was both ?most? vntrue and scandalous, for men at all times might speake freely their mind?, and that they did at this verie Court as one example might shewe it, (when after a longe dispute about the Graunt of land? in the Su?er Iland?) the Court was diuided and Twenty of the Com- panie went on one side, and one and Twenty on the other, All the Lord? Knight? and gentlemen beinge on the one side: And this Act shewed plainely what men durst doe, Neither was the Gouerment Tirannicall nor the Companie so silly and simple men as mr Wrote would make them: where if he had bin present at that Court (and other meeting? of the Counsell and Co?ittees) wherevnto he was warned, he would haue seen and heard thing? carried and handled in a fairer manner then he nowe deliuers them to be, and much mar- veyled he would thus censure the proceeding? of the Quarter Court and other meeting? whereat he was not but tak? all vpon hearesay. After this mr Wrote willed Sr Edwin Sandys to keepe his owne lawes ?wch he had made? and therevpon cited a lawe, where to avoide the drawinge the Companie into debt it is ordered that no perticuler man make or propound any newe Proiect of charge to the Companie, but he withall offer good meanes howe to defraye that charge and vphold his Proiect the Breakers of wch order are to be excluded from the generall Court? xc: The Lord Cauendish told him that he had not onely affronted him in perticuler but the Ea: of Southampton also and the rest of the Counsell and Co?ittee: who after this buissines was pro- pounded vnto both the Companies at their seuerall Court? on ffriday before the [112] Quarter Courte mett the Tusday after, both fore- noone and afternoone about it, whither himselfe was perticulerly also warned by the Officer and havinge taken consulta?on therein (not with a purpose to conclude vpon any thinge but to prepare that buissines) brought the same to the Court? held the next daye to be amended and ordered as they should see cause: As for terminge the Lawes to be Sr Edwin Sandys lawes, his lp: told him he had donn the Companie great wronge and that this was the reward that men had for doeinge pub- lique seruice: And he might aswell haue said, the Instructions giuen to the Gouernor of the Su?er Iland? were his because he made the first draft of them: And added that he had donn more harme by that dayes worke then Captaine Martin Capt: Baylie or Capt: Argall. Wherevpon mr Wrote said my good Lord I protest vpon my salua?on I had no intent directly nor indirectly to perstringe the Ac?ons of the Counsell or of yor lp: or of my Lo: of Southampton for I confesse yor courses haue bin alwayes like yor selues noble direct iust and plaine but I speake of things donn in yor lps absence when you were out of Towne whereof you can take no notice. As for Sr Edwin Sandys lawes he called them noe otherwise then a great Lord did, and said that he had taken paines 40: dayes in exam- ina?on concerninge the Spanish wrecke and that he was a weary of beinge any longer of any Pollitique body: And further said that see- inge his lp: was thus displeased with him, he would not trouble that Court where his lp: was Gouernor but would deliuer vp his Share at the next Su?er Iland? Court, wch if he did, the Lord Cauendish said he would not entreat him to keepe it. Touching the lawe cited by mr Wrote Sr Edwin Sandys made answeare that that lawe was prouided in case any perticuler man should propound any newe Proiect of charge vnto the Companie: whereas this was a buissines incident to the Contract, wch the whole Companie agreed vnto and had vndertaken, Besid? he said, it was not intended that this charge shalbe laid vpon the Companie, but onely as they beare a parte beinge to be raised out of a perticuler nego- tia?on vpon the Tobacco whose propper burden it was, and that it was not 2500li but only 2000li wch was propor?oned for the charges of this buissines: ffor the other 500li except it might be much for the improuement of the Co?odity should not be expended but returned againe to the owners of the Tobacco, and of the 2000li propor?oned the Kinge bearinge one Third part and the Spanish Tobacco a double charge in propor?on to the Planta?ons Tobacco, there could not be at the most aboue 800li to come out of the Tobacco of the Planta?ons, out of wch the Companies should be eased of some Salaries that they nowe paye to Officers and should [113] haue a howse of their owne, wch was a most fittinge and necessarie thinge; and for wch together with Warehowses they had in their iudgment? proportioned 160li So that the Su?e raised vpon the Aduenturers and Planters Tobacco toward? the payment of the Salaries was but a smale matter and such as would be questionles manifoldly repaid by the improuinge of the price of Tobacco through their care and iudgement that should man- age it: wch charge of Salaries therefore could neither disharten the Aduenturers nor vndo the Planters (as was alledged:) As for the instance of Captaine Martin, the cases were not alike that beinge to ruñ out of the Companies Stocke (Wch was none) and therefore must need? ouerwhelme the Companie with debt: This beinge to be raised yearely out of the Tobacco that come in and therefore the Companie could not be hereby indebted. Mr Deputy said that mr Wrote spake out of his ignorance (ignorance of fact he meant,) because mr Wrote was not at the Co?ittee, but mr Wrote replied that mr Deputy spake out of the abundance of his knowledge, but he out of his conscience. Mr Deputy went on and said that the matter of Salaries were not sur- reptitiously carried but most fairely and orderly with those due prepara?ons that ought, havinge bin first handled and treated of in a Co?ittee before the Quarter Court of Virginia whereat the Lord Cauendish was and amongst diuers others (mr Wrote) himselfe where after the Offices of Director, Deputy, Treasuror and Co?ittees were approued and liked of: the matter of Salaries was by himselfe pro- pounded, as he said mr Gibbs could well remember who propoundinge 100li Salary for the Office of Treasuror, mr Deputy said it was a great deale to litle: Wherevpon mr Gibbs said it might then be 200li but it was replied that that would likewise be to litle: and this Co?ittee beinge nine dayes before the Quarter Court wherein the Salaries were giuen, it could not be said they were surreptitiously carried, men hauinge so longe time warninge to thinke what was to be donn in that point, Besid? in the Su?er Iland? Præparatiue Court, the Ea: of Southampton after the nomina?on of Director and Treasuror, said that for the other Officers and the Salaries they should be referred till the Quarter Court it selfe, wch was a second warninge to the Com- pany to take their bethinkinge and to consider of the matter of Sala- ries, yet to the intent that thing? might be ye better disgested, the Earle of Southampton afterward thought fitt the Tuisday before the Quarter Court to assemble the Counsell and Co?ittees, whereat the Lo: Cauendish the Lo: Cauendish Padgett Sr Edw: Sackuill Sr Iohn Dãuers and a [114] very full Counsell of others beinge pres- ent, all thing? and in perticuler this matter of Salaries was verie seri- ously debated and considered of, both in the forenoone and the afternoone, and to this Counsell mr Wrote himselfe was warned: So that (he said) this matter was prepared both by the Counsell and Co?ittees: But mr Wrote said I must nowe vnwillingly come to an accusa?on against Sr Edwin Sandys and the two Deputies and tooke exception against the first Co?ittee spoken of before the Virginia Quarter Court, sayinge, it was verie dissorderly some men talkinge ?uately by the fireside, wch he said was mr Deputies fault who ought to be the Moderator of Co?ittees besid? the Secretary was not there, To wch mr Deputy aunsweared that he did not knowe that he did not knowe that it was any essentiall matter, whither the Secretary were there or no; whose place himselfe had many times supplied when there was need or occasion of writinge, but many and the most sort? of matters resolued on by Comittees were vsually reported by some ?one? of them to the Court. As for the disorderlynes that was spoken of, that was their owne, not his fault who could wish more orderly- nes, But that and many other thing? he was glad to passe ouer, because that men would do when they came as themselues pleased, and it was not for him to reproue them. Mr Wrote further obiected that neither the Counsell and ?nor? Co?- ittees had authority giuen them to treat of that matter of Salaries because it was not perticulerly sett downe, But mr Deputy made Answeare, that it was the selfe same great Co?ittee, to whome by the Quarter Court? in So?er, All thing? belonginge to the Bargaine were co?itted to be by them prepared and digested who thereby had authority sufficient, although they had not this later time been desired to consider of and prepare all such thing? as were necessarie to be passed in the Quarter Court when the bargaine should be absolutely concluded and ratified by the Lord Treasuror. Mr Wrote said further that there were thing? brought into the Court as the iudgement of the Co?ittees concerninge point? referred vnto them by the Court wch were not their doing? wch mr Deputy denied and willed him to instance one example: Wherevpon he said the matter of peti?ons, wch mr Deputy at the begininge of the Court brought downe vnto him wett and asked him howe he liked it: But mr Deputy replied, that though mr Wrote was absent yet the Co?ittees mett twice there- about, and that himselfe by their entreaty drewe vp the thinge in their presence and appealed for wittnes vnto them that were present. [115] Mr Wrote further challenged mr Deputy for wronge entringe of a Court wch mr Deputy denied and willed him to be better aduised. Mr Deputy made protesta?on of his owne integrity in the buissines of Salaries and that for the two great Salaries whereat onely men might stumble (for the other they could not be deemed but with the least) he said he knewe those Offices were most vnwillingly accepted of by them, especially by one of them, who but for conscience sake and the seruice of the Companie he knewe would neuer haue taken the place and concluded that for his part if any could shewe a better course then was beguñ he would ioyne with them, and so he doubted not, but all the Counsell and Companie would doe, but desired that thing? might be propounded in an orderly and due manner. Sr Edwin Sandys said that mr Wrote in vndermyninge the seuerall part? of the Contract and matters incident therevnto beinge nowe con- cluded with the Kinge did wronge the State, mr Wrote protested he spake nothing against the Contract but onely against the Salaries. Mr Bromefeild signified much greife for mr Wrots proceeding? and concluded there was much time spent to no purpose for it could not be that any thinge could be altered till the next Quarter Court if then there were any cause. Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion in defence of this Contract to informe the Court of the manner of the bargaines proceeding from the verie begininge and howe that they were by necessity of continuall preiu- dices drawne on by their proiect? (who it seemeth more affected their owne priuate Co?odity then the prosperinge or subsistinge of the Planta?ons to a willingnes yea and desire of makinge some Contract wth his Matie hopinge vnder it to enioye, all graceous fauor in their buissinesses: ffirst he said there was 6d ?li laid vpon Tobacco aboue the former Custome, And although the Patent did clearely free them from it, yet they were opposed by so tough an aduersary (who farmed the 6d) that that it was to their losse at one time to the value of aboue 1000li sterlinge. The next yeare after vpon the Patent for sole Importa?on graunted vnto Sr Thomas Roe and his Associat? they were constrayned from bringinge in any more then 55000 waight from both the Plantations: And the yeare imediately following (it seemeth vpon some newe Proiect) he heard that they required to bringe in all the Tobacco of both Plantations. [116] The variety of crosses aduised them to listen to the makinge of some setled Contract with his Matie aswell for his Mats proffitt as for the benefitt of the Planta?ons thereby to exclude newe practises of the same or other newe Proiectors, and yet this verie Contract for sole Importa?on had his begininge from an offer made by some principall Members of the Companie, (one whereof was then present) as was openly deliuered at the Counsell Bourd by a verie Honoble ?son in the hearinge of many on both sid? then attendinge wch offer of theirs beinge of a large propor?on of money was the occasion of those courses wch haue bin since pursued wch in fine are determined in this Contract, wch as it hath pursued in all the most materiall point? and ?the? iudge- ment of the howse of Co?ons in the late Assembly of Parliament, so he hoped that beinge waighed in the balance of equall iudgement (the present State of all thing? considered) to tend both to the safety and benifitt of the Plantations and noe lesse to the reasonable proffitt of all Aduenturers. Mr Alderman Iohnson said that it was another bargaine that he offered, but for this bargaine he was sure it was said in the Towne, it was Sr Edwin Sandys contrivinge and for the Salaries his opinion was that if the buissines thriued well they should ?well? deserue them; and ?mr Alderman? protested further that by the oath he had taken, he neuer went about any bargaine but once with Sr Edwin Sandys and Sr Iohn Wolstenholme to the Counsell Table beinge sent by the Com- panie and for the Companies ?vse?. mr Caswell said that what Sr Edwin Sandys had reported was true for he heard it. Mr Wrote said that because he could not haue thing? put to the ques- tion, and for diuers other reasons of offence he did appeale to the Quarter Court, And mr Wrote also demaunded ?desired? that they would take some course for the poore Planters seinge he could not be possessed of his owne good? but must come into the Companies hand? whereby they must attend their sale and in the meane time haue not wherewithall to furnish himselfe with necessaries. Sr Edwin Sandys said that they had had consulta?on diuers times about that matter. To wch mr Deputy replied that this pointe had not bin forgotten but seriously taken into considera?on, and that in reguard in the man- aginge of the Contract there was not onely matter of proffitt to be reguarded but there would also ?likewise? occurr many [117] point? of Iustice and equity; besid? other matters of very high nature, the Companie had conceaued fitt besid? the ordinary Co?ittee wch consisted of men fitt for Tradinge to choose another extraordinary Co?ittee of gentlemen all of them of the Counsell, of wch number mr Wrote him- selfe was one, who were to assist the buissines with their best Coun- sell espeacially in buissinesses of this nature wherefore he desired him, if he had any thinge in this pointe for the accomodatinge of the Plant- ers, (wch the Counsell and Comittees were exceedingly solicitous of) that he would at their meetinge deliuer it vnto them. In the ende the Court beinge much scandalized at the disorder- lynes vsed in callinge in question and disputinge of matters ordered in the Quarter Court, vrged that it might be put to the question whither this matter should be at all disputed, but in a Quarter Cort wch beinge accordingly donne it was ordered it should be silenced till the next Quarter Court.

His lp: further acquainted the Court that this gentleman beinge desirous to haue had some place of comaund in Virginia and findinge the Companie for the present had no place there for him fittinge his quality was therefore an humble Suitor to the Kings Matie, that Whereas by his Highnes Letters Patent? vnto the Company there is reserued to his Maties vse a fift part of the gold and Siluer Oare that shalbe found in Virginia his Matie would please to appointe him to be the Receauor thereof But such was his Maties graceous fauor vnto the Companie that he would in no wise graunt him his said Suite vntill he brought a Certificate from the Companie of their consent herevnto: Wch Certificate mr Zouch did nowe solicite the Companie ?for?: Wherevpon the Court takinge it into their considera?on after some delibera?on had thereon ordered a Certificate to be drawne vp to this effect vizt.

At this Court was read first the Court for Virginia held on the Su?er Iland? Quarter Court daye the 27th of Nouember: After wch a good pause beinge made, the Ea: of Southamptonn signified that he pro- ceeded after this manner from the verie begiñinge, whereby if any would take exception at what was sett downe they might haue liberty to speake to it: But no exception beinge taken thereat, his lp: caused the next Court to be read beinge that of the 4th of Decembr wch donne Capt: Martin made request that his old Patent might be redeliuered him, beinge but deposited in the Secretaries hand? vpon trust and therevpon desired Sr Edward Sackuill (at whose mo?on he resigned in Court) to speake howe it was, who said that true it was he aduised him to deliuer it vp, because it was exorbitant and vnlawfull, but said confidently that his surrender was absolute and therevpon the Court was pleased to promise him a newe Patent as large as had bin graunted to any other, and touchinge the insufficiency of his old Patent he was told the Mr of the Rolls had receaued good satisfac?on, Capt: Martin herevpon desired he might haue a Patent accordinge to the Kings Letters Patents and the Articles; But he was answeared the Com- panie would [120] not make newe formes of Patent? for him, but was offered as large a Patent as that graunted to my Lo: of Southampton himselfe or any other auncient Aduenturer whatsoeuer, But Capt: Martin presented in Court a Booke entituled Noua Brittania with a Publication thervnto affixed, signed by the Ea: of Southampton and Some others: In wch booke he said there was promised 500 acres for a single share: wch beinge pervsed, and the word? were found to be not of promise but of hope that vpon diuision there might be allotted so much hereafter vpon a share, but the Booke was noe Act of the Court but a private mans worke. After this the Ea: of Southampton addressed himselfe to mr Wrote admonishinge him that nowe he had heard the last Court read and the seuerall passages therein, he would applie himselfe and direct his speach wholly vnto the part? thereof, and declare freely, whither matters were truely sett downe or noe, Wherevpon mr Wrote humbly praid his lpe and the rest of the Lord? and others of the Counsell, that they would please to giue him a full hearinge and that such excep- tions as he should nowe make to the settinge downe of that Court might be admitted and entred wch he said were of three sort?, first of Omissions, Secondly for insertinge the order of his speach and not settinge downe thing? in their due place, Thirdly for that it was not donn with that candor and fairenes toward? him as ought. And beinge required to goe on accordinge to that order, he said first there was an omission of a speach of his in answeare of the Lo: Cau- endishes to this effect followinge: That he did not ?string the Ac?ons of the Counsell, for he acknowledged the Ea: of Sout?ton? proceed- ing? to be alwayes like himselfe, most noble, direct, iust, and plaine, but he said he spake onely of some thing? donn in his lps absence when he was out of Towne whereof his lp: could take noe notice, And desired the Court to consider that he did not then beate the Aire or fought for nothinge, for he said he was at that time much pro- uoaked first by mr Deputy who charged him of ignorance, Secondly by Sr Edwin Sandys who said he had donn wronge to the State Thirdly by the Lord Cauendish who was heauy and personall. To the first mr Deputy made Answeare that in then speakinge that word he did with the same breath explaine himselfe, sayinge I meane ignorance of fact because you were not present. To the second Sr Edwin Sandys said that if mr Wrote was prouoaked by his speach it was against his will he beinge a gentleman that he had [121] much respected, and that for the word? wch mr Wrote nowe challenged him of they were spoken after ?that? mr Wrote had spoke so violently ?spoken? against the carriage of those buissinesses in the Quarter Court so that it was Prouocatio post factum. And the Lo: Cauendish told him that the word? he then spake could not be otherwise interpreted but spake against the Contract. Mr Wrote herevpon made a request vnto the Court that Wittnesses on either side might be examined, and that he might not be proceeded against vpon mens memories, and that he might haue liberty to except against some of them, and desired (because his Cause might be a lead- inge example) that his Tryall might be legall and by the Quarter Court vnto wch he appealed. His lp: answeared that he could not haue a better tryall of the trueth of thing? sett downe in the Court then by such as were present at that Court that both heard and sawe what passed on either side. But mr Wrote desired his request might be put to the iudgement of the Court the 7th of October last whither it were not equall that he required. Mr Wrote also charged mr Deputy for the false entringe of a Court the 7th of October last, whereby the Company was brought into debt 3000li. To wch mr Deputy answeared that for the entringe of that Court it was truely and faithfully sett downe by the Secretary and himselfe accordinge to the passages and meaninge of the Court as they conceaued, and was as the order is read on the next Court day followinge, at the readinge whereof mr Wrote himselfe was, and tooke no exceptions, wch if he had knowne there had bin any falsity he ought to haue donne, and otherwise was guiltie of that falsifica?on wch he nowe challenged him of, But mr Deputy said he would by them that were present sufficiently proue the Court to be true entred: And as for settinge of the Companie 3000li in debt there was no such manner of thinge. But the Ea: of Southampton said they were gonne quite from the buissines they had in hand and asked mr Wrote why he refused to be tryed by this Court who aunsweared, he had iust cause to decline the testimoneyes of such as were partiall but desired he might haue liberty to take a full informa?on from those that were then present the Court consistinge of Threescore ?sons: and complained of the longe intermission of the Corts as if they had bin put of purposely to his preiudice. [122] Wherevpon the Lo: Cauendish declared vpon what occasion the Court? were put of namely Sr Iohn Brooke accompanied with mr Iohn ffarrar cominge vnto him, Sr Iohn Brooke told him that he founde mr Wrote sorrie for what he had donn and that if my Lo: of South- ampton had not bin gonn out of Towne he would haue gonn to him to haue giuen his lp: satisfac?on: Wherevpon he willed that mr Wrote would sett downe his submission vnder his hand: wch he would send vnto my Lo: of Southampton, and therevpon Sr Iohn Brooke in mr Wrotes behalfe desired his lp; that the Virginia Court wch was the next daye to be kept might be put of; for if ye proceeding? of the former Court should be openly read he was then bound to stand vpon his iustifica?on and for these reasons, at Sr Iohn Brooks earnest request in mr Wrotes behalfe, his lp: caused that Court to be put of and for no other reason. Wherevpon Sr Iohn Brooke acknowledged the trueth of what the Lord Cauendish had deliuered and for that reason the Court was put of: But mr Wrote said he offered not any Submission, but desired peace vpon certaine free condi?ons vizt, That his suspen?on from the Coun- sell should be revoaked, that he should be restored to my Lord of Southamptons fauor and that nothing should be entred in the Court to his disparagement: Wherevnto Sr Iohn Brooke replied that he did not well remember what was then in perticular spoken for he did not thinke he should be called to an Account for it, but said his principall end and ayme in this was to haue made a peace if it had bin possible. Mr Brooke said that somethinge of necessity must be donn for the honor of this Court wch had bin much scandalized by mr Wrote as for mr Wrots appeale to a Quarter Court he said, it was rather an Appeale from the Quarter Court by Spinninge out the time: And whereas mr Wrote moued for liberty to appointe some to take deposi?ons of Witt- nesses on his behalfe he held his mo?on to be verie inconvenient and vnfitt, for neither could any but the Deputy and Secretary take the deposi?ons, and besid? such manner of proceeding? would cause a number of great inconveniences that would neuer haue an end, and wished mr Wrote to be better aduised in his speeches, and not seeke thereby to abuse mens iudgements for whereas he said the proceeding? of the Parliament vpon an offender was no president for an Inferior Court, he said, the greater Court is, the better president; and that an affront euen to the Court of Pipowder is lyable to censure and pun- ishment, and therefore much more to so Honoble a Court as this was. The Ea: of Southampton said that mr Wrote ought not to teach them howe to iudge, but willed him to hold to the buissines in hand and to declare whither his word? were truely sett downe in that Cort [123] or no sayinge he had beguñ well and should proceed on still in the same manner to declare the rest of the omissions and his other excep- tions, mr Wrote excepted against the whole Court, sayinge he spake not those word? neither in manner nor forme as they were sett downe, and therefore moued that seinge the Court was eight week? in settinge downe he might haue leaue sometimes to ouersee and pervse the same: And moued further that seeinge they were newe falne vpon matter of Sallaries in this great heate of dispute beinge the stringe whereat he chiefely strooke, that therefore the Salary men might not be pres- ent when that buissines was put to the question: And as for mr Deputy he excepted against him as his Accuser. Mr Deputy said he was no Accuser of mr Wrote as was well knowne, for the true recordinge of the Court it was the duty of his place and protestinge that he did not knowe of any thinge sett downe amisse nor willingly omitted any thinge to mr Wrots preiudice, and besought the Ea: of Southampton that the Court might be examined by part?. Mr Herbert said that it was to be considered whither they will by Wittnesses or by the whole Court then present examine whither the said Courts be truely or falsely sett downe wch he conceaued was most fittly to be donn by those that were then present Mr Lawrence Hide said that the Custome of the Court is the lawe of the Court and find? mr Wrote haue erred exceedingly against it, and cannot excuse him of folly that he moues from §for§ flyinge from the Court, and therefore admonished him to confesse his error and if he refuse, he feares he hath some worse end? in this course he hold?. The Ea: of Southampton after many digressions made by mr Wrote recalled him to the present buissines of the Court in question demaund- ing of him what exceptions he could take against it,: mr Wrote replied he excepted in euery perticuler matter in that Court that concerned him. At length for rectifyinge the Court and for makinge this a leadinge President, it was proposed whither the Company Court would admit of any exa?ina?on of Wittnesses vpon oath and such other courses as mr Wrote desired for Tryall of this buissines or noe, or whither they would trye it by the testimony of them that were present wch beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? agreed and ordered that it shalbe only tryed by those that were then present and eare Wittnesses and not by any such newe and vnusuall courses [124] as were desired: And because it might be the more exactly &amp; cer- tainly donn, it was proposed by some that a large Co?ittee might be chosen out of them that were present at that Court to examine the true entry and thereof to make report. But Sr Iohn Dãuers said that a great inconvenience will befall the Companie to reco?itt that wch is sett downe by sworne Officers, for that any man out of this example may thereby question and trouble the Court infinitely. Mr Withers said he had seen and bin conversant in many Court? but neuer sawe matters Recorded by a sworne Officer to be questioned. At length much time beinge spent in this pointe, it was agreed and ordered by a generall erec?on of hand? that for examininge and recti- fyinge the aforesaid Court of the 4th of December, those onely who were then present (as the most competent wittnesses in this case) shalbe againe warned by the Officer to meet on ffriday next to examine duely the perticular passages of the said Court whither it be rightly sett downe by the Secretary or no: And hauinge so rectified the same to the best of their knowledge and memory are to make their report vnto the next Court of their proceeding? therein. The Ea: of Southampton also desired so many of the said Court as were nowe present would take notice of the meetinge on ffriday in case the Officer should not warne them all, in respect the Secr? had not taken the names of all that were present at that Cort. This beinge donn ?passed? mr Wrote moued for a Coppie of the said Cort whereby he might the better informe himselfe of what had passed and make his exceptions vnto each ?ticuler the more full, but this was by diuers thought verie inconvenient for many waightie reasons and an ill President and that ?haps vse might be made thereof, much to the Companies preiudice, And mr Io: Smith said that since the trueth of the Court was denied by mr Wrote, and not as yet confirmed by the Court it was not a Record, so as it was but onely to be accounted as a scroll or priuate writinge and therefore it was not fitt to deliuer him any Coppie of it, till beinge fully confirmed and approued it might haue the authority of a Record: Wherevpon it beinge put to the ques- tion, whither mr Wrote should haue a Coppie of it ?It? was by erec?on of hand? denied him. But it was ordered that he might haue if he would ?vse it as long as he pleased. [125] After this mr Wrote moued that he might take not?, wherevnto Answeare was made, that if he might haue leaue to take what not? he would it were all one to let him haue a Coppie: Lastly the Act of Counsell touchinge mr Wrote was read.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At a meetinge of his Mats Counsell for Virginia at Mr Deputy ffarrars howse in St Siths Lane on Wedensday the 11th of DecembR 1622 Present Right Honoble Ea: of Southampton.

The Ea: of Southampton signified that the occasion of callinge this Counsell together was to acquainte them with a late informa?on he had receaued since his beinge in the Countrie touchinge mr Wrote who as he had heard had co?itted a great indiscre?on at the last Court held this day sennight by speakinge after violent and turbulent manner aswell against some point? incident to the Contract, as also against the proceeding? of the Counsell and Co?ittee together with the Act? of the Quarter Court? wch had confirmed the same, bend- inge his speach also to the wronge and disgrace of some principall Members of the Companie who had bin imployed in that buissines, whereof he said the Lord Cauendish had in generall aduertized him by his letter without naminge the man that had so donn as might appeare by the Letter it selfe wch his lp: offered to shewe him, wch disorder his lp: said was the occasion of his cominge vp to Towne and of his beinge here at this present and therevpon charged mr Wrote ?to? declare whither this informa?on were true or noe, who therevpon said that at his first settinge downe in this Assembly he conceaued himselfe to be free but being [126] nowe charged as a Delinquent he was to answeare in his owne defence: And therevpon touchinge the matters laid to his charge he freely protested against any power or iurisdic?on the Counsell §could§ haue to question him for that he then spake, consideringe he had (as he said) appealed vnto a Quarter Court, wherevnto he would only submitt himselfe: But he would con- ferr with them if they would, And withall he accused mr Deputy of havinge falsely entred the Court of the 7° of Octobr last either by his or the Secretaries fault and contrarie to the true meaninge of the Court then held whereby he said the Company were brought into 3000li Debt: wch speach beinge deliuered by mr Wrote in a verie violent and contemptuous manner; in wch selfe same manner also mr Wrote had carried himselfe toward the Ea: of Southampton at his first cominge into the Roome before the settinge downe of the Counsell ?his lp. repeating the same briefly to the Counsell? proceeded to aske mr Wrote what he meant thereby and whither he tooke himselfe to be so great a man that they were all as Pigmies in his sight, and added that he did not knowe him to be any Prince of the Bloude, and therefore if it pleased him he might carrie himselfe with more calmenes and respect. Wherevnto mr Deputy replied to the perticuler Accusa?on made against himselfe that it was of a verie high nature and deepely concerned the Companie, for the Court? beinge the Companies Record?, the charginge of them with falshood was to call all the pro- ceeding? of the Companies into question: And that for himselfe if it should be found that he had donn any such thinge, he deserued pun- ishment, and therevpon briefely declared the manner of the entringe of Court?, howe that the Secretary hauinge drawne them vp brought them to him and he accordinge to the Companies order perused them, and so they were read in the next Court: And accordingly he said was that Court nowe spoken of by mr Wrote, and no exceptions taken against it. In the end he humbly desired that this matter might be strictly examined. But the Ea: of Southampton said that this was not the buissines they had nowe in hand nor pertinent therevnto, but should be taken into considera?on in due time and place and therefore required mr Deputy to declare in ble breife the matters that mr Wrote did so much inveigh against at the last Court: Wherevpon mr Deputy said that mr Wrote did then insist vpon these three point? vizt. 1.The lesseninge of the fower Shares. 2.The Com?: bearinge the 10th ?t: in ye Ioint Stocke for bringinge home the Spanish Tobacco. 3.The Salaries. But his lp: said that because not onely the matter it selfe he spake of, but his manner of speakinge might much augment his offence he therefore required mr Deputy to deliuer what his word? were [127] concerninge these ?ticulers: Whererevpon mr Deputy beinge much pressed herevnto said that mr Wrote declared himselfe herein with a great deale of passion wch he conceaued did much mislead and distem? him. But the Ea: of Southampton said he had heard mr Wrote should saye the buissines was not fairely carried; but matters were hudled vp, that ?and? some thing? were fowly and surreptitiously carried, with much art and to priuate end? and that the Companies durst not speake because they were ouerawed. Mr Wrote protested he spake not against the Contract but against the proceeding? of the Co?ittee and against Sr Edwin Sandys and the two Deputies acknowledginge that he then said (and was of the same minde still) that they had vsed much art in the carriage of this buissines. Wherevpon mr Brooke the Lawyer said that in all Court? of iustice it was a thinge certaine that if a man speake to the disgrace of the Iudge or his iudgement ?or the Court? he was subiect to fine and co?ittment at the pleasure of the Iudge, and so in priuate Corpora?ons where any shall speake to the disgrace of the ?son of the Gouernor or Act? of the Court or gouerment thereof, he conceaued the like censure and punishment might passe vpon him. But mr Wrote replied he was not nowe Coram Iudice and therefore they could not censure him of wch opinion mr Binge was also speak- inge (as he said) out of his experience and knowledge in the Ciuill Lawe Mr Deputy beinge againe much pressed by the Lord? to deliuer clearely and fully what mr Wrote had spoken in open Court as being bound so to doe by the duety of his place (especially when he was therevnto required by the Counsell) said that he well remembred that mr Wrote said then the buissines was not carried fairely and did also well remem- ber that himselfe did saye the buissines was not surreptitiously car- ried, but whither mr Wrote said the buissines ?It? was surreptitiously carried or no, he remembred not, but he conceaued he spake not onely of the proceeding? of the Co?ittee but generally of the whole buissines. Mr Deputy was generally blamed of the Counsell as seeminge out of his private respect to mr Wrote to remisse in his duety to the pub- lique: The Ea: of Southampton protested that if himselfe had [128] bin in Court, he would not haue required another to haue declared mr Wrots proceedings, and so his lp: and the rest of the Counsell (seeminge to require of some other the ?formance of that duety wherein mr Deputy was so backeward) the Lo: Cauendish said that if mr Dep- uty would not ?forme his Duty beinge required by the Counsell they must fall vpon him, and mr Brooke was of the same opinion. Wherevpon mr Wrote replied to the Lord Cauendish, then you had best be my Accuser, wch vnreverend speach was much distasted by the Counsell and the Ea: of Southampton told him, that although they were all Counsellors, yet there was verie great difference between the ?sons of diuers of them and in ?ticuler between mr Wrotes and the Lord Cauendishes to whome he ought more respectfull behauior and language. But mr Io: ffarrar said that mr Wrote questioned the Gouermt, and the Act? and power of the Quarter Court ?in open termes? sayinge he would do it againe and againe, though he was told often that he ought not to doe it, and the Court by hand? had ordered accordingly as beinge contrary to all lawe and custome and to noe purpose but to disturbe the proceeding? of the Company yet could not ?swade mr Wrote to be quiet mr Wrote replied that he said the Quarter Court had no power by the lawes of the Companie to deriue that authority they did to an inferior Court except in cases, either of inevitable necessity or evident vtility but in this case there was no such thinge to enforce the same: Wherevnto Sr Edwin Sandys made Answeare that by his owne word? it was apparant he questioned the power of the Quarter Court and therefore his speach concerned the maine body of the Contract, but he said he would nowe goe vpon his owne graunt and that forsomuch as the maine bodie of the Contract was so solemly ratified in a Quarter Court and that there fell out some smale differ- enc? between the Lord Treasuror and the Companie wch could not be at that time accorded without further conference, there was herevpon an inevitable necessity of transmittinge the authority of the said Quarter Court vnto another Court to ioyne with the said Su?er Iland? Companie in their ?Quarter? Court to debate further of the said differences, and to ioyne in a finall conclusion of the said Bar- gaine and other thing? thereto incident. Hee said further touchinge his elec?on to be the Director that although he was ?most? vnwillinge as diuers then present could wittnesse to take the place wch was so earnestly pressed vpon him by the [129] Court, yet beinge chosen therevnto, and the Lord Treasurors eye beinge nowe fixed vpon him he could do no lesse then labor a finall conclusion of all matters incident to the said Contract together with the Contract it selfe. But touchinge mr Wrots carriage of himselfe in this buissines he said he had obserued two mayne materiall exceptions wch in his opinion were iustly to be taken against him, first for that he inveighed against that wch beinge ordered by the Quarter Court could not be reformed for the present, Secondly in that he sought to mainetaine his opin- ion by misallega?ons aswell of the lawes of the Realme, as also of the lawes of this Companie by the one dishartninge and deterringe of the Companie from proceedinge in the Contract as it was nowe concluded and ordered, by the other insinuatinge into the mind? of his Hearers a conceit of ill carriage by the Counsell and Comittees contrary to the established lawes and orders of the Companie. Touchinge the lawes of the Realme he said that mr Wrote then deliuered that by drawinge the generall body of the Companie into bearinge a part of this Contract and by giuinge the Seale for the ?formance thereof they engaged the priuate estate of euery ?ticuler Member to be aunswearable to the Kinge what dammage soeuer should befall in wch Allega?on as he clearely failed in his iudgement in pointe of lawe so he vsed this ill meanes to ?a? worse end, and con- clusion namly the disturbance of the Contract so solemnly concluded with the Kinge and nowe not to be revoaked. And touchinge the lawes of the Companie he manifestly misalledged them to the great wronge aswell of the Counsell as of the Co?ittees who to his vnderstandinge had punctually obserued them in all thing? as namely in makinge Shewe that they were to loose their voices for a yeare who had moued to drawe the Companie into matter of charge without shewinge meanes howe to defray the same and applyinge this lawe to the Propositions for Salaries whereas first it was no matter of charge to the Companie, beinge not to be raised out of their Stock? but out of the Tobacco to be brought in, and secondly it was not the mo?on of any ?ticuler ?son wch is onely forbidden in that lawe, but proceeded from an Act of the Counsell and Co?ittees, where by the waye he praid mr Wrote not to be troubled with the office and Salary granted vnto him, for as he accepted of both most vnwillingly and in sole obedience to the Court, So at the next Quarter Court he would resigne both the one and the other. In reply herevnto mr Wrote bid Sr Edwin Sandys put his speach into a Sillogisme, and then he would answeare it for it was Argumentum a Desperatis. [130] Touchinge the matter of the lawe of the Realme mr Herbert beinge nowe present was desired to deliuer his opinion who said that without all question the priuate estat? of men could not by lawe be made lyable to paye that for wch the whole Companie stood engaged, vnles there did appeare a practise in some of the Companie to decline the debt? by indirect meanes of wch opinion mr Brooke was also and cited a case longe since tryed in Westminster Hall vpon occasion of one that beinge a member of the Corporation of Norwitch that stood engaged at that time for debt was arrested in Westminster Hall for the Debt of the said Corporation, wch matter being forthwch brought to tryall he was acquitted by the iudgment of the Court for that the lawe in that case look? not vpon any perticuler mans person or estate but vpon the whole body of the Corporation as it is vnited and not in his part?. As for the lawe wch mr Wrote had cited with a kinde of skorne and contempt by terminge it to be one of Sr Edwin Sandys lawes wch saith that if any perticuler man proposed any matter of charg vnto the Companie and could not finde meanes to defraye the charge and vphold his Proiect, he was to be excluded from cominge to Court?: It plainely appeared by the word? of the Lawe it selfe to haue bin both misalledged and misapplied. My Lo: of Southampton demaunded of mr Wrote, why he did raise and mainetaine so strangely that dangerous Proposi?on of the Seale, it beinge a pointe of lawe and he no lawyer. But mr Wrote said that since the last Court he had taken the opinion of some learned Lawyeares by whome he was informed that mens priuate estat? were also subiect vnto the Companies engagement? by their Seale. Herevpon the Ea: of Southampton told him that he nowe sawe his indiscre?on to be as great as he tooke it to be, that beinge of the Counsell he would not impart his minde concerninge that pointe first vnto them, but rather diuulge his opinion in open Court to the preiu- dice of so mayne a buissines as the Contract was and that before he was sufficiently grounded in that wch he spake as appeared by his owne report in askinge Counsell after he §had§ so confidently pub- lished his opinion. With this mr Wrote Departed sayinge that he came not thither to heare ill word?. [131] Wherevpon the Ea: of Southampton appealed vnto the iudgement of the Counsell then present what iust occasion of offence hath bin giuen mr Wrote that he should goe awaye in that vnrespectiue manner: And therevpon his lp: protested that seeinge he had so much wronged him and the rest of the Counsell and Co?ittee in their proceeding? and spoken also against the Companie and Court? and most scornefully against the lawes in terminge them Sr Edwin Sandys lawes and in conclusion went away in that ill and most vnciuill fashion he expected to be righted against him for so many wrong? and affront?. Wherevpon mr Gibbs said that mr Wrote was one, whose heart he knewe as well as another and he protested he had alwayes heard him speake with as much loue and respect to his honor as any man lyvinge, so as he was ?swaded in his soule and conscience he had not so much as an ill thought against his lp: in all that he had said but reguarded and honoured him as much as any man whatsoeuer. Wherevnto the Ea: of Southampton replied that he should be sorry to haue liued soe that it should be in the power of mr Wrote to wronge him in his Honor or reputa?on, but his lp: said that mr Wrote hav- inge complained that the Counsell and Co?ittee carried this buissines fowly and disorderly and against the lawes of the Company and to priuate end? howe that could be and himselfe cleare he could not vnderstand: for he said that from the begininge to the end of this buissines, he had not bin ?not? only priuy and consentinge to the pro- ceeding? but the principall Actor also in them all. As for the word ffowly (said by some of the Counsell to haue bin vsed by mr Wrote) mr Withers beinge called in by the Counsell testified it likewise to haue bin so spoken by mr Wrote and that therevpon out of his loue toward? him and to prevent his goeinge forward in such ill termes, he replied againe sayinge that the buissines had bin fairely carried and wished that if his Co?ittiship did trouble him, it were the price of his reconcilia?on. After this the Counsell entringe into consulta?on what was fitt to be donn herein for their reputa?on. First mr Brooke deliuered his opinion that he conceaued it fitt that a collec?on be made of those matters that are to be obiected against mr Wrote to be ripened against the next Quarter Court vnto wch he hath appealed for that (as he pretended and alledged) he was Coram non Iudice. [132] It was also thought fitt generally by all the Counsell then present in reguard he had co?itted so great a contempt against the Counsell there, that he be suspended from cominge any more to Counsell vntill he cleare himselfe of those matters obiected against him and there- vpon caused the Secretary to sett downe his suspen?on in manner followinge At a meetinge of his Mats Counsell for Virginia the 11th of December 1622 The said Counsell haue ordered that notice shalbe giuen to mr Wrote by the Officer that in reguard he hath carried himselfe this daye before them with verie vnfitt and vnrespectiue behauior they thinke fitt he forbeare from co?inge to Counsell vntill those things he stand? charged with all be cleared.</field>

[133] The Ea: of Southampton signified that this Court was extraordinary and onely for one end, namely to veiwe a former Court of the 4th of December last and that as the buissines was fixed so the Companie was also, for that they and onely they that were then present were to be warned to be at this Court: Wherevpon Sr Phillip Carey departed sayinge, he was not then present: But mr Binge said that he con- ceaued that notwithstandinge the order of the last Court, it was meant it should be free for any to come and heare though not to giue their vot?: Wherevpon mr Binge was desired to withdrawe himselfe till it were put to the question whither those onely and noe other that were at the former Court? should be nowe present; It was by erec?on of hand? ordered that noe other should be sent here, and therevpon mr Binge departed. My lo: of Southampton propounded that for the better proceedinge in this buissines the Court might be first read wholly ouer and after- ward examined by part? wch was agreed vnto. Mr Wrote demaunded whither this meetinge were a Court or a Co?ittee and beinge resolued it was a Cort, though onely for one purpose, he begañ after co?enda?on of his lps noble gouerment, to speake some- what of the office of a Gouernor but his lp: recalled him to the buissines of the daye, tellinge, it was not nowe time to make harangues touch- inge the Duty of a Gouernor. Mr Edw: Iohnson the Lawyer declared his opinion that the Deputy and Secretary were not by their duety bound to enter but onely the maine passages of buissines concluded and the materiall point? han- dled in the Court? and not matter of word?: Wherevpon it was no preiudice to their reputa?on, that matter of word? should be reexam- ined or reformed. Mr Wrote said that he suffered for the seruice of his Matie and for ?forming his Duty. Hee also moued that all such as are salariated men might be excepted from giuinge their votes when the matter comes to the Proposition of Salaries, because they were not interessed therein and might be partiall. The Ea: of Southampton aunsweared that his exception was vniust to debarr them from bearinge of wittnesse of the truth of matters passed, beinge chosen and approued by the Court as men of honestie and integrity and it was not the case nowe, whither they should haue Salaries or no, but whither the Cort were right entred or noe and accordinge as it passed. [134] Mr Wrote complayned that diuers ?sons were scattered in sundrie places of the last ?Court? who disswaded them that satt about them from passing of any thinges in his fauor and therefore desired they might be silenced, and he did not doubt but he should haue a noble Tryall. Mr Deputy answeared he knewe nothinge of that wch mr Wrote spake but he was credibly informed that diuers strangers not free of the Companie were there in fauor of mr Wrote and in ?ticuler two Tobac- conist? whose greatest desire is to ouerthrowe the bargaine, one of them he knewe beinge his next neighbor who did most violently vrge, that mr Wrote might haue a Coppie. To this mr Wrote replied that diuers lackies and Servingmen at the Lower end of the Hall held vp their hand? against him and com- plained of mr Carter for it. But mr Deputy answeared that the matter of Coppie was carried by a very great deale of Odd? in the number of hand? and that of those that satt in the body of the Hall. Mr Wrote said that mr Brooke, mr Smith and Sr Edwin Sandys onely had spoken against the grauntinge him of a Coppie and thereby hindred him, and seemed to complaine, that it was against the course of all Court? of Iustice and praide God the same course might be held when the like cause should befall him: To wch Sr Edwin Sandys said Amen, wishinge he might neuer haue a fairer Tryall nor better Iustice: And withall added that he did not conceaue mr Wrote to be accused but was the Accuser both of the Counsell and Companie. Mr Wrote complained of the Secretary that would not suffer him to take not? of the Cort because as he said he had no order for it. Mr Wilmot said that his opinion was, it was the generall conceit of the Court that he might take not? before the Coppie was put to the question, but it was replied by diuers others, that it was not the meaninge of the Court yt he should take not?; it beinge said that if he might take what Not? he would, it were all one as to let him take a Coppie but that it was the Court? Order that he should haue a free and large ?vsall as himselfe would wch the Secretary affirmed he had at his howse accordingly. [135] But mr Wrote still complayninge for want of not?, offered to depart the Court, wch if he did, the Ea: of Southampton said the Court would notwithstandinge proceed as beinge sufficient Iudges of the true entringe of the Court and wherein they might proceed although he were at Yorke. Wherevpon mr Wrote stayd, complayninge againe for want of Not?, and that the Court? beinge sett downe much to his preiudice he could not make his full defence: And therefore said he would make his defence legally and by some other course And that if the Quarter Court righted him not, he would appeale to the Kinge the fountaine of iustice and mercy. But mr Deputy said, that the Secretary told him, that mr Wrote had taken large notes wherevpon the Secretary said mr Wrote had written out halfe a sheit of pa?, But mr Wrote said it was only in what Pages thing? were. Sr Iohn Dãuers said, he held it impossible for the Secretary to sett downe each mans ?ticuler speach at large And therefore conceaued that if the materiall point? and substance thereof were rightly taken, it might satisfie the Court. Mr Wrote replied that this opinion would mislead the Court and there- fore desired that they would take it into their serious considera?on howe much that course might tend to his preiudice and disadvantage. Mr Wither moued that seeinge mr Wrote talked of appealinge to the Kinge, it might be remembred that when the pointe of Not? was in Proposition and disputed vpon, Notwithstandinge it was much con- tradicted, yet it was not desired by mr Wrote to put it to the question whither he should take not? or noe. Mr Wrote againe protested he would appeale to the Kinge in the selfe same termes as he did before. Mr Wrote said that mr Wither had said abroad that my Lo: of Sout?- ton might as a Priuy Counsellor co?itt him, and protested that vnder that feare he durst not speake freely. The Earle of Southampton made Answeare that he need not feare any such thinge from him, for whatsoeuer respect? and addi?ons he had, he left them all when he came to this place and came here onely as their Treasuror. [136] The Court beinge wearied with these interruptions and impertinences desired his lp: to hold to the buissines of the daye ?they came for? Wherevpon his lp: put his former Proposition to the question, vizt that the Court should be wholly read ouer and after ?ward? examined by part?, and so the Court was entirely read ouer wch beinge donn it was the second time beguñ to be read and mr Wrote willed to make his exceptions. Wherevpon mr Wrote said that there was an omission in the very front vizt that mr Deputy presently after the settinge downe of the Court excused himselfe that the Court kept on the Su?er Iland? Quarter Court daye could not be then read because it was not drawne vp for want of time, and therefore desired that the readinge of the Court might be put of till the next Court followinge it, and this excep- tion he said was verie considerable for if the Court had bin read wherein was declared howe the buissines of Salaries passed, it would perhapps haue so well informed him, that he should not haue spoken so much as he did. This O?ission mr Deputy confessed to be true but protested it was not out of willingnes but of forgettfullnes, and so did the Secr? where- vpon it was ordered to be inserted as appeareth in the said Court. After this was read Sr Edwin Sandys speach consistinge of many part? and branches, wherein he did declare what himselfe and the rest of the Co?ittees had donn concerninge the buissines, against wch mr Wrote tooke onely one exception: Vpon these word? vizt for that he knewe some worthie gentlemen would willingly haue vnderwritt in the said Roll if they might haue bin admitted vpon the purchase of two shares only, sayinge that Sr Edwin Sandys said in the Counsell that it was but one gentleman yt would aduenture 50li Sr Edwin San- dys said that he spake with two gen?: about vnderwritinge whereof the one absolutely promised and the other did not deny. The Ea: of Southampton replied it was not nowe the question what Sr Edwin Sandys said at another time, but what he said then and therevpon demaunded of the Court their opinion, who generally agreed that the whole speach of Sr Edwin Sandys and that clause in pertic- uler was rightly sett downe, and beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed that all those speeches were truely and rightly sett downe. [137] After this was read mr Wrotes speach in the begininge whereof he tooke exception at these word?, As if their lawes were like the Lawes of the Meads and Persians protestinge with great confidence that it was falsely sett downe by the Secretary and that he did not speake those word? in that Court: But the Secretary by vertue of his oath said he did speake them and that those word? were in his Minut?. and Diuers of the Companie did testifie that he did speake them. Amongst wch was mr White the lawyer, but withall he said he thought he did not vse the ?word? Lawes but orders: and therevpon those word? to their orders as if their orders Lawes was thus amended to those orders as if those orders were like the lawes of the Mead? and Persians and so it was approued to be spoken. Mr Wrote tooke a second exception also in the same speach in that it is there sett downe that himselfe said he was the first proposer of it denyinge that he said so, for he said himselfe was not the first Pro- poser of it but mr Deputy ffarrar: But mr Deputy ffarrar said, that who was the first Proposer of it was not materiall, but that mr Wrote did in that Court saye himselfe was the first Proposer was true by vertue of his Oath, and further said that his aunsweare therevnto did necessarily inferr: wch answeare was generally acknowledged: And the Secretary likewise said by vertue of his oath that that pointe was true. But mr Wrote denied it confidently offeringe to sweare he said it not; but mr Copeland affirmed that he directly remembred mr Wrotes speach to be so in substance as was sett downe: Wherevpon it beinge put to the question that pointe by erec?on of hand? was con- firmed to be truely sett downe. Mr Wrote further excepted in the selfe same speach against that clause, But rather ?that? it might run his due course of examina?on by a Comittee &amp;c sayinge that he neither spake of Co?ittees nor of Quarter Court?. ffor the first pointe of Co?ittees mr Sparrowe avouched directly that he spake of Co?ittees and of co?itinge thing? accordinge as was sett downe. Wherevpon there growinge a great question vpon mr Wrots constant denyinge of it, mr Wrote in great heate complained of wronge that hauinge two sufficient wittnesses that he did not saye it, that there should be any question of it. Wherevpon the Ea: of Southampton asked him wch were his wittnesses, wherevpon he named mr Edw: Iohnson and mr White the Lawyer, But mr Iohnson said he would not sweare it nor saye [138] it for he did not vse to affirme Negatiues and mr White said ?the cleane contrary?, yt he vnderstood the cleane contrary, that he vnderstood that mr Wrote did speake of Co?ittees accordingly as is entred, Wherevpon it beinge put to the question it was by erec?on of hand? confirmed that it was rightly sett downe not one dissentinge. ffor the second exception of Quarter Courts it was accordinge as mr Wrote desired amended vizt whereas it was thus But rather it might run his due course of examination by a Co?ittee and in seuerall Courts before it were brought to the Quarter Court the word? and in seuerall Courts before it was brought to the Quartr Courte to be ordered: It is nowe thus amended or in the followinge ordinary Court before it be ordered: This part of his speach beinge put to the ques- tion was by erec?on of hand? confirmed to be rightly sett downe. Mr Wrote further excepted that the Remainder of that speach of his was not in his due place, and that before he spake mr Gibbs made a longe speach to the same purpose of giuinge the Seale to Secr? Dauison to C?re ?tis Cr. mr Gibbs was of opinion that he spake some such thinge, but not being §verie§ confident thereof, mr Wrote said that he would make him confesse it or he would make him no man, and that he would make him sweare it in the Chauncery or in the Starr- chamber. Sr Edwin Sandys, mr Io: ffarrar, and mr Deputy confidently affirmed that mr Gibbs did speake no such thinge in the Court, but that those speaches of mr Gibbs alledged by mr Wrote were spoken after the Court in the Parlor in priuate and afterward at the Counsell Table the weeke followinge wch the Lord Cauendish also testified: Herevpon mr Wrote affirmed vpon his oath, that it was otherwise: To wch creditt not beinge giuen by the Court he vehemently protested he would appeale vnto the Kinge, and in great passion challenged the Ea: of Southampton for giuinge him the lye in the Third person at a Sumer Iland? Court, saying that if any man should saye that in any thinge men were ouerawed and durst not speake it was put into his mouth by the Deuill the father of lyes for a fowler lye himselfe neuer told. To wch his lp: made answeare that what he had said he would iustifie and mayntaine and that if mr Wrote ?would? take it to himselfe he might. Mr Wrote also challenged his lp: further for sayinge that he blundred out his indiscre?on and that in such a manner as that the whole Court therewith seemed to be highly offended and mr Bland said my Lord I haue seen in another Court if any had spoken so much he had bin co?itted. [139] Wherevnto mr Wrote replied you are a verie indifferent man and I thanke you for it. Mr Bland made answeare for my part mr Wrote I tooke you to be as iudicious a man as any of the Companie vntill you first began this buissines. The Ea: of Southampton said that had he carried himselfe so in any other place but this he would not haue endured it and sharpely willed him to behaue himselfe after a better manner; After this returninge againe to the question of mr Gibbs speach, the whole Court beinge ignorant of it, and it seeminge impossible, that he should be the first mouer of soe many remarkeable thing?, and yet the Court tooke no notice of it: It was generally co?ended ?conceaued? by the Court that it was a matter wholly mistaken by mr Gibbs and mr Wrote and rather spoken in some other place. Mr Wrote further excepted against the word (only) in this Clause And was the only cause of their vnwillingnes to vnderwrite to the said Roll, but beinge put to the question it was by erec?on of hand? confirmed to be truely sett downe. After ward ?this? the Remaynder of mr Wrots speach beinge put to the question, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed to be right entred as it was sett downe in the Booke Onely in the end thereof this addi?on followinge was put in wch mr White said he remembred mr Wrote spake: The Companie beinge in debt, the moneys Payd in to the Companie by such as subscribed might be presently seized vpon accordinge to the custome of the Citty whereby the Companie should pay vse for the Stocke and not haue the same to imploy to any benifitt: But howe this was induced mr White saith he remembers not fully. After this was read Sr Edwin Sandys speach to mr Wrots allega?on of the lawe wch by erec?on of hand? was approued to be rightly sett downe. After this was read mr Deputies speach to mr Wrotes Proposition of co?ittinge thing? againe that had bin comitted ?determined? by the Quarter Court wch by erec?on of hand? was approued to be rightly sett downe. After this mr Withers speach and the speach of one other touching the former point were read and in like manner approued to be rightly sett downe. [140] After this Sr Edwin Sandys replie to mr Wrotes speach touchinge the Companies bearinge a Tenth part in the Aduenture for bringing home the Spanish Tobacco and touchinge mr Wrots opinion that priuate mens estates was liable to make ?good? the Companies engagemt by their Seale was read and likewise approued by the Court to be rightly sett downe. ?After this mr Caswells Report of mr White the Lawyers opinion touching that point of mr Wrotes speach of the engagement of priuat mens Estats Cr was read and approued to be rightly sett downe.? ?After this? mr Alderman Iohnsons ?Wrotes? speach that matters were not fairely carried but were hastily shuffled ouer beinge read, he excepted against these word? as not spoken in this place. Mr Iohnson said he did thinke that the word? (not fairely) were spoken. But the Lo: Cauendish said that he did well remember that mr Wrote vsed in that speach these words not fairely carried and that he vsed also either the word Shuffled or hudled ouer in the verie same place: Wherevpon it beinge put to the question it was by erec?on of hand? confirmed to be rightly sett downe But mr Wrote said there is in the later end of his said speach an omission of an instance that he then alledged which he said he deliuered in these word? (vizt) That he was therefore confirmed in that opinion because of the late example of the Muscouy Company: wch word? the Court agreed should be added accordinge to mr Wrotes desire. After this mr Ald?an Iohnsons speach and mr Withers reply there- vpon touchinge the Muscouy Companie were confirmed to be truely sett downe: But mr Alder?: ?Iohnson? desired that this might be added also namely that this instance was confirmed by mr Mellinge. Where vpon ?vnto? Sr Edwin Sandys made answeare that mr Melling? speach did rather confirme the cleane contrary: And mr Mellinge was desired to sett downe his owne speach wch ?here? followeth ?viz? Mr Mellinge beinge present replied it was true that a levia?on for pay- ment of the Muscouy Companies debt? was ordered by the Lord? of his Mats most Honoble Priuy Counsell to be made out of the gaines made vpon their seuerall Stock? in the seuerall yeares when those moneys were supposed to be borrowed and taken vp at interest and not to be laid vpon the whole body of the Companie or them that were not Traders in those yeares or since. [141] After this mr Deputies speach touchinge the vnseasonablenes of mr Wrotes Proposition Cr was read wch by erec?on of hand? was approued to be truely sett downe. After this the Lo: Cauendish his report of the faire carriage of the buissines by the Counsell and Co?ittees was read wch by erec?on of hands was confirmed by the Court to be truely sett downe. And whereas after this, it is said that the Argument beinge still main- tayned with such violence and vnorderlynes against so many good reasons as had bin alledged, mr Wrote tooke exception at the inter- linea?on of these word? with such violence and vnorderlynes wch word? he said was sett downe in another hand, charginge the Secretary vpon his oath to declare who inserted those word?: Wherevpon the Secre- tary said it was his hand and they were put in by mr Deputies appointement. Mr Wrote replied that these words were verie considerable, because they might lead to an Accusa?on of him against the Quarter Court but it was generally knowne and confessed that the Court that day was so much disordered by his interruptions and violent speaches as the word? were generally adiudged by the Court to be rightly sett downe, and therevpon it beinge put to the question they were by a generall erec?on of hand? approued (onely three dissentinge). Wherevpon mr Wrote said I ame glad of it gentlemen that you haue preiudged me in this case vnto the Quarter Court vnto wch I appeale and therevpon said saluo honore of the Court he would depart. After this mr Deputies speach and protesta?on was read wch beinge put to the question was by a generall erec?on of hands approued to be truely sett downe. Mr Iohnson said that he departed the Court before mr Deputy made this Protesta?on and saith there is an o?ission of some word? that mr Wrote spake for he heard mr Wrote say that he knewe many eyes were vpon him and desired the speaches he had spoken might be sett downe. After this mr Wrotes Answeare to mr Deputies protesta?on was read and put to the question and by erec?on of hand? confirmed to be rightly sett downe. After this mr Deputies replie to mr Wrot? vrginge his form9 Proposi- ?ons to be put to the question was read and by erec?on of hand? approued to be truely sett downe. [142] Next the manner of the Proposition was read and by a generall erec- ?on of hand? was likewise confirmed to be truely sett downe. Next the Lo: Cauendish report touchinge the buissines of one Wye was read and by erec?on of hand? confirmed to be truely sett downe. Next mr Wrotes speach therevpon was read and by erec?on of hand? confirmed, onely in the later end mr Wrote desired an addi?on of these word? followinge wch he said he did then deliuer (vizt) for it was nowe no worke of a gentleman but of a Solicitor wch word? the Court agreed should be added as mr Wrote desired. Next a Letter from mr Henry Reynold? in the behalfe of one Iohn Taylor was read, wch was put to the question and confirmed to be truely sett downe. Next mr Wrotes speach touchinge the Salaries was read, wherevnto mr Wrote tooke exception sayinge, that he deliuered those reasons at interloquutory times and not together as was sett downe, and that the word Deriuatiue was o?itted to these word? at the last Court, whereas he said at the last Deriuatiue Court: but the Court did verie well remember that he deliuered those reasons together and the Answeare that followeth doth necessarily imply so much, wherevpon it beinge put to the question wth the addition of the word Deriuatiue as mr Wrote desired it was by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed to be truely sett downe. Next the speach in answeare therevnto was read and approued by a generall erec?on of hand? to be rightly sett downe. After this againe mr Wrots reply touchinge the Salaries was read whereat mr Wrote tooke exception sayinge that he did not speake the word? together as in that clause they are sett downe vizt matters were carried fowly and disorderly and with much arte surreptitiously and to private Ed end? and that the Companie durst not speake their minds because they were ouerawed. But mr Wither said vpon the first word (ffowly) he recalled him: and that mr Wrote beinge then in a great heat and passion added all the rest of the word? followinge in that speach and generally the whole Court testified it to be so: Wherevpon that speach of mr Wrot? beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed to be rightly sett downe. [143] Next the speach of mr Withers vpon the word fowly and of mr Cas- wells vpon the worde ouerawed, and likewise the manner of mr Alderm: Iohnsons interrupting of mr Caswell in his said speach were read and beinge put to the question were confirmed by erec?on of hand? to be rightly sett downe. Next mr Iohn ffarrars speach to the words ouerawed and durst not speake was also read wch beinge put to the question was by erec?on of hand? confirmed by the Court to be truely sett downe. But as this was a doeinge mr Wrote came from the further end of the Table to mr Iohn ffarrar whisperinge some word? privately in his eare, wch the Ea: of Southampton observinge, co?aunded with much earnestnes mr Iohn ffarrar to declare what mr Wrote said, who at length beinge much pressed herevnto by his lp: said that mr Wrote vpon hearinge his speach nowe read said vnto him in this manner, you would not haue said vntrue to me in another place wch mr Wrote denied to haue spoken in that manner: But his lp: sharpely reproued him for his ill behauior and said plainely it was noe other but a kinde of swaggeringe. After this mr Wrotes Allega?on of the 108 lawe was read, but he said these word? vizt (wch he had made) next after the word lawes in the second line were not spoken by him: Wherevpon the Lord Cauendish caused them to be strucke out as mr Wrote desired, confirminge the rest to be truely sett downe. Next the Lo: Cauendishes speach touchinge mr Wrotes affrontinge him and the read rest of the Counsell and co?ittees was read and approued by the Court to be truely sett downe. But mr Wrote told his lp: there was an omission of some word? that he vsed toward? him at that time; namely that he had donne more harme by that dayes worke then Capt: Martin Capt: Baylie or Capt: Argall, wch word? my Lo: Cauendish callinge nowe to minde desired they might be added wch the Court generally agreed vnto. Wherevpon mr Wrote said himselfe spake these word? followinge wch he said were o?itted vizt: My ?good? lo: I protest vpon my salua- tion I had no intent directly nor indirectly to perstringe the Ac?ons of the Counsell nor of yor Lp: or of my Lord of Southampton for I confesse your courses haue bin alwayes like yor selues noble, direct, iust and playne, but I speake of things donn in yor Lpa absence when you were out of Towne whereof you can take no notice: with this addi?on wch he desired to be inserted after these word? And further said that he was wearie of beinge any longer in polliti- que bodies and that he had taken paines 40: dayes in examina?on of buissines concerninge the Su?er Iland?. [144] As for Sr Edwin Sandys lawes he said that he called them no other- wise then ?as? a great Lord did wch addi?on to the rest of his speach beinge put to the question was confirmed to be rightly sett downe. After this Sr Edwin Sandys answeare vnto the lawe cited by mr Wrote was read and by erec?on of hand? approued to be rightly sett downe. Next mr Deputies speach was read: Whervpon mr Wrote tooke excep- tion of ?at? some word? omitted that were spoken by mr Deputy at that time vizt that he taxed him of ignorance but mr Deputy answeared that he said mr Wrote spake out of his ignorance sayinge I meane ignorance of fact (explayninge himselfe with the same breath) wch mr Copeland well remembringe iustified it to be true. Wherevpon mr Wrote said he made this replye sayinge, mr Deputy speaks out of the abundance of his Knowledge but he out of his con- science, mr Deputies speach beinge put to the question is confirmed generally to be rightly sett downe. Next mr Wrotes exception exception against the disorderlines of the first Co?ittee and mr Deputies answeare therevnto was read and beinge put to the question were confirmed to be rightly sett downe onely in the begininge thereof mr Wrote said that he spake these word?: Then I must vnwillingly come to an Accusation against Sr Edwin Sandys and the two Deputies, wch he desired might be entred. And mr Wrote further alleaged that mr Gibbs spake likewise diuers thing? thereabout?, but the ?ticularities thereof were gen9ally by denied by the Court to haue bin spoken at least not to haue bin heard of the Court and the Lo: Cauendish, Sr Edwin Sandys, mr Deputy and mr Iohn ffarrar constantly affirmed that those thing? were spoken in the Counsell afterward and not at that Court: Wherevpon it beinge put to the question it was adiudged by a generall erec?on of hand? that the speaches were not spoken at that Court And that mr Wrote and mr Gibbs were mistaken and that those speaches were spoken in some other place and not in that Court. After this mr Wrotes Obiec?on that neither the Counsell nor Co?ittees had authority giuen them to treat of the matter of Salaries And mr Deputies Answr therevnto beinge read were approued by the Court to be truely sett downe. Next mr Wrots speach touchinge thing? brought into the Court by mr Deputy as the iudgement of the Co?ittees wch he said were not their doing? instancinge the report made vpon the matter of peti?ons beinge read mr Wrote excepted against it, sayinge that these word? were o?itted [145] (vizt) that he said that mr Deputy at the begininge brought that report downe vnto him wett and asked him howe he liked it, wch Speach of his and mr Deputies replie together with the addi?on were by erec?on of handes approued to be rightly ?truly? sett downe. Next mr Wrotes challenginge mr Deputy for ?the? wronge entringe of a Court the 7° of Octob: last was read and approued by a generall erec?on of handes to be truely sett downe. After this mr Deputies protesta?on of his owne integrity in the buis- sines of Salaries was read and by erec?on of hand? approued to be truely sett downe. Mr Bromefeild? speach was read and approued to be rightly sett downe. Sr Edwin Sandys speach in defence of the Contract was read where- vpon mr Wrote said there was an o?ission of these speaches follow- inge namely that Sr Edwin Sandys said that mr Wrote had donn wronge to the State and therevpon mr Wrote said he made this pro- testa?on that he spake nothinge against the Contract but onely against the Salaries: Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys his speach with these Addi?ons beinge put to the question were confirmed to be rightly sett downe. Next mr Alderm: Iohnsons speach beinge read he desired these word? might be added, mr Alderman therevpon protested that by the oath he had taken he neuer went about any bargaine but once with Sr Edwin Sandys and Sr Iohn Wolstenholme to the Counsell Table beinge sent by the Companie and for the Companies vse. Sr Edwin Sandys also desired that mr Caswell? report that he had heard as much at ye Counsell Table might be likewise added. Mr Wrote said that in this place there is an omission of an Appeale that he made in this manner vizt: That because he could not haue things put to the question and for diuers other reasons of offence he did appeale to the Quarter Court. Mr Wrote said further that mr Ditchfeild made a stronge argument against the Salaries, But a doubt beinge made whither mr Ditchfeild was at that Court or noe, mr Alderman ?Iohnson? said that he well remembred that he was there and made some short speach touchinge that pointe, but no body knewe what it was. After this mr Wrotes speach touchinge the care of the Planter was read whereat he tooke exception, sayinge, that he did not propound that question by waye of de?aund (as is expressed) but by waye of desire wch he praid might be entred after this manner, mr Wrote desired that they would take some course for the poore Planter &amp;c and the rest as followeth in that clause ?seeing he could not be pos- sessed of his owne good? but must come into the Comp. hand? whereby he must1 1 A sign is used to carry the interlineation to the margin from this point to the end of the insertion. attend their Sale and in the meane tyme haue not wherewth all to furnishe himself wth necessaries?: Wherevpon the rest of his speach with this amendmt beinge put to ye question, was generally approued to be rightly sett downe. [146] Sr Edwin Sandys likewise desired that the speach he made therevpon might be likewise entred, namely that they had had consulta?ons diuers times about that matter wch the Court generally agreed should be put in. After this mr Deputies speach to the same pointe was read and beinge put to the question was approued by the Court to be rightly sett downe. Next the question that was put whither this matter should be at all disputed but in a Quarter Court was read and approued by the Court to be rightly sett downe. This donne the Draft of the whole Court with the addi?ons and reforma?ons that had nowe passed was put to the question and by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed to be rightly sett downe onely one dissentinge. After this it was agreed and ordered that this Court should be warned to meete againe on Monday morninge next to examine whither these former amendment? be truely entred or no. Afterward mr Wrote moued the Ea: of Southampton and the Lord Cauendish for a Coppie of the Act of Counsell touchinge him but they held his request vnfitt to be graunted, Notwithstandinge they graunted him leaue to ?vse the same at his pleasure and were not against his request to take not?.</field>

[148] Sr Iohn Brooke moued the Court in behalfe of Capt: Iohn Martin that they would please accordinge to my Lord of Sout?tons promise to graunt him a Patent with as ample priuiledges as hath bin graunted to his lp: or any other auncient Aduenturer and that his Shares of land men?oned in his former Patent or shall become due for trans- porta?on of ?sons at his charge may be laide out in Martin Brandon, wch request the Court agreed vnto hauinge alwaies offered as much vnto him: But whereas Captaine Martin moued that he might haue therewith those Swamps and boggs as lay neare thereabout, wch could not be planted and yet might be of great vse vnto him for keepinge of his Swyne; The Court made him Aunsweare that he must be con- tented to take his due propor?on of land together as it shall fall out in that place of Martin Brandon of wch as he saith he was formerly possessed. After this mr Deputy propoundinge the passinge of certaine Shares from mr Carter to other ?sons there arose some questions and opposi- ?ons about them, Sr Henry Mildmay said he was sorry to see so much dissention and variance still continued amongst the Companie, but professed himselfe was neither of the faction nor factions, and said his Matle had lately taken notice of these differences, and is a hinder- ance to other mayne buissines of speaciall consequence vnto the Plan- tation and that his Matle vnderstands that diuers Aduenturers haue bin discouraged from goeinge on, and wonders that so many are will- inge to giue ouer their Shares. He signified further that his Matle did desire to preserue the liberty of the Companie in euery kinde and that no ?ticuler man of the Com- panie be abridged of his liberty to speake freely so it be with fittinge report vnto the gouerment and the Plantation. Hee said further that he came not to stirr vp a storme but to allay it and make a Calme, and said at the last meetinge of the Counsell he moued that these verball differences might be taken vp and that his Matle did likewise desire an end of them, but saith that this he relat? was accidentally and by waye of discourse with his Matle. Mr Deputy made Answeare that the Companie did much ioye to vnder- stand that his Matle pleased to take their affaires so much into his royall considera?on and desired Sr Henry Mildmay to the entent the Company might fully ?forme what his Matle required (because the Court was nowe but smale) he would please to leaue his message in writinge or stay till my Lord of Southampton and the Lord Cauendish comes to report the same againe vnto them. [149] Sr Henry Mildmay beinge desired to satisfie the Court whither he deliuered this as a Message from his Matle or from himselfe, made aunsweare that he deliuered it by waye of aduise and from himselfe vpon a late discourse that he had with the Kinge but no waye as a Message from his Matle. Mr Deputy excusinge the weaknes of his memory that he doubted not to be able ?fectly to sett downe Sr Henry Mildmayes speach, besought him that he would be pleased againe to deliuer it to the Secretary but he aunsweared that he would be here on Wedensday next to obserue whither the same hath bin rightly taken by the Secretary. Sr Iohn Dãuers said he held it most necessarie that before they pro- ceeded any further to state Sr Henry Mildmayes Speach wch he wished might be put to the question, whereat some opposed, and mr Deputy beinge about to put it to the question, Sr Henry Mildmay desired it might be spared till Wedensday next, when he would againe be pres- ent: Wherevpon the Secretary was required to read those head? he had taken of Sr Henry Mildmayes speach wch he did and was approued. This donn the Court desired mr Deputy to returne againe to the buissi- nes of the Daye and to propose the Shares that were to be passed. Wherevpon the Court passed these Shares followinge of mr Carters vizt To mr Christo: Vyvyan of London, Clothworker 1 share To mr Ed: Palmer of the Midle Temple Lond: esc? 14 shares To mr Tho: Morse Haberdasher 1 share To Tho: Lathum of London gen? 1 share To Ia: Carter Marriner 1 share To mr Ed: Palmer esquire 11 shares To Rich: Norwood gen? 1 share 30 Which Shares by the bill presented appeared to haue bin sold the most of them in Iuly. Also Sr Wm Twisden knight and Barronett passed three Shares of land in Virginia vnto Sr Roger Twisden his Sonn: All wch Shares being put to the question passed the allowance and approba?on of this Court. [150] Also Wm Burnham passed ouer one Bill of Aduenture of 12li 10s 00d and one ?sonall Share of 100 acres of land in Virginia (descended vnto him by the death of his eldest brother Sam: Burnham) vnto mr Iames ffothergill: wch was likewise put to the question and confirmed vnto the said Iames ffothergill. Mr Deputy moued for order to drawe three seuerall Patent? viz to these men vizt To mr Iames Haberly and his Associat?. To m- Arthur Levellis, and to Cap? Iohn Martin wch was accordingly ordered to be drawne vp against the Quarter Court. Mr Roberts moued the Court for a letter of reco?enda?on vnto the Gouernor of Virginia in the behalfe of mr Arthur Leuellis that is nowe to take a Patent that himselfe and his people may be respected and well accomodated after their arriuall in Virginia. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court howe farr the Auditors had proceeded vpon the Account? of the old Magazine of Virginia (mr Essington havinge brought vnto them his book? wch he said had his begininge some 5 yeares agonn, but said he would giue the Aduenturers but litle comfort for that they were like to receaue for ought yet appeares) but litle aboue halfe of their principall money, that there was nowe 1000li to be diuided amongst them, and also added that there was a great difference between mr Essingtons and ye Capemarchant? book?, mr Essington charged him with 400li more then he acknowledged but he said they were not yet come so farr that he could giue them a cer- taine resolu?on where the fault lye laye. Mr Kightly taking notice of the great losse the Aduenturers were like to sustaine of their principall money after so longe forbearance said that he had heard it crediblie reported, that their Capemarchant was at first a verie poore man, but through his imployment in the said Magazine, was become exceedinge rich, whereas his bargaine was that he should be recompenced out of the gaines of their Stocke: he there- fore wished that the buissines might be strictly looked vnto. Mr Deputy moued yt the Aduenturers for some considera?on to be had for mr Cuff? paines bestowed about those Account?. Mr Deputy presented also a note of certaine Debt? due vnto the Com- panie whereof he named some (vizt) mr Morris Abbott who stand? indebted 38li  7s mr Nicho Leat 43 mr Wm Caninge 88 – 5 – 7 Capt: Io: Bargraue by subscription 512  10 – 0 The Aduenture in the Susan wch Sr Tho: Smith or Al-} derm: Iohnson is to pay 105 – 0 – 0 [151] And further that there was brought to that Account neere 100li: for charges in followinge the Suite against Capt: Bargraue. These buissinesses and Debt? laye as it were a sleepe because there was noe one perticuler mann to followe them, and although diuers men had Shares in the buissines, yet euery man would rather loose his part then put vpon himselfe any trouble or labor. Sr Edwin Sandys said that he would nowe make a mo?on against their Salaries whereat diuers gentlemen had taken exception, that for his Salary it Should not trouble them for he would surrender it vp with a better will then euer he tooke ?it?, But said that whereas mr Wrote deliuered to the last Su?er Iland? Court a Proiect howe the Contract shalbe well managed with lesse charge then nowe it is ordered he desired the same might be nowe read to this Companie: whereby if a better waye may be found then was formerly it may be taken into considera?on and followed. Mr Moorer co?ended mr Wrotes proiect to be verie good and worthy of respect and considera?on. Sr Henry Mildmay said he was not directly of the opinion of mr Wrote in that paper wch was read touchinge his Proiect vizt That the poore Planter should be so limitted for the sale of his good? But said his opinion was that these great Salaries were directly the waye to ouer- throwe all, and said true it was they passed the last Court with his vote but he was nowe of a contrary opinion sayinge secundæ cogita- tiones sint longe meliores, and further added that he conceaued his Matie would rather that the Contract should not goe forward at all then to the ruine of the Planters, and said he was of opinion the buissines might haue bin better husbanded. The Lo: Cauendish said he held it fitt the Counsell be assembled, to consider what better course can be proposed for the well managinge of this buissines. Sr Tho: Wroth moued that the Court might nowe deliuer their opinion touchinge the Salaries because it so much concerned the poore Planters. Capt: Rossingham said this course of consigninge all the Planters Tobacco that shall come home into one hand would much preiudice the Planters and exceedingly discourage them, but he was answeared that he spake against the mayne body of the Contract for without that it could not be. [152] Mr Iohnson the Lawyer made request he might haue liberty to speake freely to the matter of Salaries wherein he protested he would vphold the opinion of no man he said the Salaries as they nowe stand modo et forma will discourage the Planters and hinder the Plantation, he therefore wished no Sallaries at all as yet or if Salaries then after a better waye then is nowe ?scribed vnto wch he said he would giue these Stepps. The first Steppe was that worthie men would please freely to continue their paines and bestowe their laboures in this buissines as others had donn for many yeares together. That if Salaries be graunted they might be by the waye of honorare or gratuities in reward of seruice donne. And if by a Stipency then not to propose so great a So?e as 2500li wch is 3d ?li vpon — 200000 waight for this he said would deterr the Impor- ta?on of Tobacco and if that faile the Companie will smart for it. Besid? he wished that the Salaries might not be raised by this vigor- ous and strict waye of imposi?ons but rather out of the aduancement of the price of the Tobacco by the sole sale of it here. Sr Iohn Dãuers said that he was himselfe a wittnesse of ye great care that the Co?ittee tooke touchinge the Salaries, but think? it will not be this dayes worke to answeare the Obiec?ons made against them, and therefore moued that they might nowe onely heare the opinions of the contrary side and to morrowe to consider of them and so pre- pare the buissines against the Quarter Court. Mr Wilmer said he was verie much discouraged and so were others whereof he would nowe shewe the cause. The first cause was about the im- porta?on of the Spanish Tobacco. The second touchinge the Salaries. ffirst he said in the Præamble to the Roll he had obserued that the Companie are to beare a 10th part in the iointe Stocke for bringinge home of Spanish Tobacco and gaue their Seale for the Security. Whereby he conceaued that if the iont Stocke faile priuate mens estat? both here and in Virginia are lyable to make good the Companies engagement and therefore wished some course might be taken to saue the Companie harmeles in case the Iointe Stocke should faile. [153] ffurthermore in the Præamble there is no caution or dispensa?on men?oned, in case the Kinge of Spaine shall raise the price of Tobacco wch he hath alreadie donn as he is credibly informed. Also he obserueth that the Vndertakers haue but one yeare graunted them, for the bringinge in of the Spanish Tobacco, wch by reason so great quantity thereof is here already in this Kingdome cannot be brought in but with much losse or verie smale gaine if the price thereof be enhaunced in Spayne. It beinge almost 6, of the Clocke it was vpon mo?on generally agreed by erec?on of hand? that the Court should be continued duringe pleas- ure This donne mr Wilmer was desired to proceed. Wherevpon he said he had obserued also in the Roll that the Importa- ?on of Spanish Tobacco is to be consigned to the Co?ittee by whome that buissines is to be managed to the benifitt of the Vndertakers who are to haue no votes in the carriage of that buissines but must be wholly left to the care of the Director and Co?ittees. His second cause ?of? discouragement he said was the matter of Sal- aries but spake not of it to any but the Co?ittees. His first reason for that the matter of Salaries as he hath heard here in Court was sodainely and vnduely carried, that the Co?ittee treated su?ficially thereof by the fires side that the Deputy was called awaye and therevpon that Co?ittee brake vp and did nothinge: At the next meetinge it was sodainely concluded vpon and so brought to the Quartr Court where he obserued a great deale of silence and many hand? held vp against it. 2 Reason that the Salaries were vnseasonably giuen because no seruice was ?formed nor was it knowne howe well they would be deserued as also in respect there is no money in Cash, but the Companie verie much in debt. 3: Reason Salaries are vnecessarie if the buissines may be otherwise managed, and think? the Director may doe good seruice by beinge a Co?ittee at large, and sawe no reason why the Director should haue such an ouerulinge power, and therefore su?fluous. And held also his Clarke to be vñecessarie. To the Treasuror he allowed 100li with a Clarke. 1 Casheire 50li Booke? 50li [154] 4 Co?ittees 50li a peece supposinge 4 to be enough, but said that those already chosen were not men conversant in marchandizinge as was fitt they should. As for the Co?ittees at large he thought it best they be rewarded as they shall deserue and so likewise inferior Officers whereby he said he abated 1150li of the former propor?on. The Lo: Cauendish moued againe that the old Co?ittees and Coun- sell together with the Assistantes of the Su?er Ilands may meete to morrowe about it, where mr Wilmer or any other that would might be present and giue their aduise touching that buissines. Sr Edward Sackuill said that he would not nowe stand to giue Answeare to prepenced and premeditated argument? but desired before they proceeded to a resolu?on that such as were of the contrary Opin- ion and had giuen out that these Salaries were vnduely carried and exorbitant in their values might haue a daye appointed for hearinge. Mr Caswell moued that whereas mr Wilmer desires there might be fower Co?ittees he might be one of those that should laye downe their Salaries and mr Barbor also desired he might do the like. Mr Bennett said he had bin present at these passionate proceeding? and that he was as much greiued at these intestine differences as at the late Massacre: And said that he obserued many to be discouraged at the grauntinge of the Salaries, but his hope then was his lp: would haue disperced those Cloud? awaye: But for his owne part he said he would most willingly lay downe his Salary but hopes this buissines wilbe againe so well debated and considered of as matters wilbe brought to an easie end. Mr Wilmer protested for the better clearinge of himselfe from that suspi?on wch some might haue of him vpon a supposi?on that he spake out of Enuy toward? the ?sons of those that had Salaries that he spake it freely out of his conscience. Sr Edwin Sandys made Aunsweare that the buissines of the Salaries was not so vnduely carried as he conceaued for the Counsell had duely considered thereof and brought their opinions to the Quarter Court wch did ratifie and confirme them But he said that the Salaries (nowe they had giuen them) cannot be taken awaye by a Quarter Court, nor the Officers that they had chosen vnlesse they doe therevnto consent: But he would that a time might be appointed for ye debating of these buissinesses without passion or partiality. [155] These thing? thus debated vpon it was at length agreed and ordered by erec?on of hand? that a Court should be be warned to meete to morrowe both forenoone and afternoone to consider of the matter of Salaries and of the best course that may be taken for setlinge of that buissines. It was also moued that such as haue accused mr Deputy of false entring of a Court will prepare and produce their proufes against to morrowe that they may be heard: Wherevnto mr Wrote said he would forbeare to doe it for the present and prosecute it in his due time and place hauinge appealed vnto his Matie. The Ea: of Southampton moued in the behalfe of a Noble &amp; worthie gentleman Collonell Ogle (that had deserued well of the Companie heretofore and was also still well affected vnto the Planta?on) that they would please to graunt him his freedome wch request of his lp: the Court most willingly condiscended vnto. Mr Mellinge moued that whereas there was heretofore a booke of Lawes for Virginia put in printe without the authority of the Com- panie wch notwithstandinge is divulged abroad to be printed by the Companies consent, that it might be taken into considera?on by a Co?ittee appointed by the Court to the end the trueth thereof may appeare wch point was referred to the Quarter Court.</field>

And in case that part of the Contract be punctually obserued that all the Tobacco to be sold in bancke it wilbe necessarie to drawe a preamble to a second roll whereby the Brothers of the Companies may be admitted to sub- scribe what Somes ?they? shall thereby be lymitted for the buyinge of the Tobacco wch poore Planters shall bringe into this Kingdome that they may not suffer by expectinge the sale of their good? and attendance for money. In this proposi?on of a certen Salary I rather giue waye to other mens opin- ions then follow myne owne iudgemt for I determine not that this is the best course but propose it as a better then that yt is already established for if it be possible to manage the buissines so, I could wish these pen?ons were changed into gratuities according to the merrit of euery mans endeauors at ye end of the yeare when the buissines is donn, and it plainely appeares yt the proiect aunswers expecta?on in point of proffitt: These two courses thus offered to the iudgemt of the Court I humbly submitt to the censure of this Honoble Companie and if they be pleased to embrace either of them my desire is they will co?end that course they best like to the Virginia Companie to be also approued by them. Mr Binge presented a paper to his lp: as from mr Wrote sayinge, it was the same that the other was onely it had some addi?ons, Wch mr Wrote thought vpon the last night wch he praid might be read. But the title of it beinge Obiections against the Salaries, it was resolued to goe on with the Proposition deliuered to the Su?er Ilands Companie and desired to be reco?ended to the Virginia Companie and desired to be reco?ended to the Virginia Company, and by the Preparatiue Court, wherein it was read and ordered to be consid- ered of at this daye wch was read all ouer together and afterward his lp: read the first Article wch was this followinge (vizt) ffirst the places of Director and Deputy shall absolutely be laid downe, and the Salary giuen to them shalbe wholly saued: The two Companies may supplie the place of Director in their extraordinary Courts called for that purpose. Touchinge wch it was first thought fitt to consider whither this newe waye were a good waye or noe and whither it be better then the other waye. Sr Robert Killigrewe demaunded first, howe it was in other Compa- nies it was generally acknowledged that all Iointe Stock? whatsoeuer are managed by one cheife man and next vnder him some other in the nature of a Deputy as the Companie had already ordered and that the course propounded in the Article read was without all President: And it was declared howe that the Companie ioyninge in a Magazine together, wch did not exceed 7000li in the vnderwritinge it was yet thought necessarie to choose a Director for the managinge of it, and the like course was held in all manner of Iointe Stock? whither for trade or Planta?on beinge all co?itted to some one man as Director or Gouernor, and therefore it was dangerous to followe a newe waye neuer before trodden. Secondly it was obiected that the two Companies haue more buissines already then they can well ?forme and therefore they would neuer be drawne together vpon such occasions so frequently as were neces- sarie. [158] Sr Edward Sackuill said that it was a verie great indignity to impose it vpon the Lord? that were the Gouernors to attend continually such buissinesses as the Director and Deputy were to ?forme. As for mr Deputy he protested that though he spent his whole time in the Companies buissines yet he was not able to ouercome halfe that was to be donne for want of helpe, and declared howe that men were not able to be gotten together for the auditinge of the Companies Account? and that wth them many other of the most waightie buissi- nesses of the Companie laye neglected: Wherefore it were to ouer- throwe all to put more vpon the Officers and Companie. Sr Edwin Sandys said that in a Bodie consistinge of many Members wch must all concurr in one Ac?on there must be by necessity of nature &amp; reason one head to containe and direct them vnto vnity that to make this one head to be two Court? assembled vpon euery needfull occasion, was a thinge not onely repugnant to the1 1 Written over "that." celerity of dispatch wch this buissines would require but also of insupportable toyle both to the Gouernor Counsell and Companie. It was also declared howe impossible it was would be to make any progresse in buissinesses in such a kinde of gouerment, where any one might vpon pretence of requiringe to haue his vnderstandinge satisfied in any pointe, call backe thing? concluded as was instanced to be donn in the Sumer Iland? Companie where there hauinge passed a matter in two ordinary Court?, and afterward? much disputed in a Prepara- tiue Court and lastly concluded in ye Quarter Court yet in an ordinary Court afterward one man because he was not present at the passages thereof he required to haue it all againe read and argued: And because the Court might be better informed concerninge this pointe the Lord Cauendish propounded that a writinge presented to the Counsell and Co?ittees before they resolued of this Course might be read concern- inge the office of the Director specified in that writinge, all wch good part? and sufficiencies although verie great the Court adiudged requi- site in him that should haue the chiefe part in the managinge of this buissines: And mr Woodall said that except him, whome they had already chosen, he thought they would not finde a man that would be able to ?forme it, but he hoped he would. In the end after a longe disputa?on of this pointe his lp: put this Article to the question in this manner whither it were not impossible that the Court? should ?forme the buissines accordinge as [159] was propounded in that first Article, the whole Court by a generall erec?on of hand? not one dissentinge confirmed it to be impossible. Concerninge the second Article wch was as followeth (vizt) There shalbe one sufficient marchant chosen Treasuror to whome the Companie may be pleased to giue 100li salary. ffirst it was obiected that the Salary of 100li was so smale as there might almost be as much lost in tellinge of so much money wch in receauinge and payinge could not be lesse then 100000li and that to giue a 100li to a man of such sufficiency as that place required and that must vndergoe so great a charge as that was, and that must giue con- tinuall attendance thereon, was an vnreasonable thinge nor would any man vndertake it except some that ment by the imployinge of the money or otherwise to make some extraordinary benifitt. It was also alledged that the East India Companie when their Stocke was but 100000li ? Anñm had giuen 300li and sometimes 4 or 500li to their Treasuror. It was also declared that of necessity the Treasuror must engage him- selfe for takinge vp of moneyes for the buissines especially for the payment of custome. In the end after much debate and dispute of the matter, the Court generally agreed, that the reward of 100li was nothinge propor?onable and seemed so sensible of the smalenes of the Salary and the greatnes of the charge and paines, as they generally declared themselues vnwill- inge to accept of the seruice of any such as would for such a matter, vndertake it: wherevpon his lp: vpon that Proposi?on made these two questions (vizt) Whither the Companie do thinke 100li ? Añu a sufficient reward for a Treasuror that must vndertake this buissines it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (saue 4:) thought vnsufficient. Secondly it was put to the question whither the Companie would will- ingly co?itt their Stocke to one that would accept of the office for 100li: It was therevpon by a generall erec?on of hand? denied.

Mr Binge moued to knowe why in settinge downe the proceeding? of the morning? Court, the reasons onely of one part vizt: that wch the Court afterward? concluded were sett downe and the Allega?ons on the contrary part o?itted: Wherevnto answeare was made that it was needles to expresse those reasons and exceptions wch were disal- lowed: And it was by diuers worthie persons approued to be the custome of the howse of Parliament Parliament onely to record those mayne reasons that induced the conclusion and to o?itt the rest as needles and fruitles. The Ea: of Southampton said he would nowe proceed to the worke of this daye namely to examine the rest of the Articles of mr Wrotes Proiect; Wherevpon the third Article was read wch was this that followe (vizt) Vnder him there may be placed a sufficient account- ant that may be his Casheir to whome may be allowed 50li or 40li Salary. [161] My Lo: of Southampton willed mr Deputy to declare what the Com- panie had concluded in this pointe, who answeared that they had had thought fitt there should be two Casheirs one continually to remaine in the Treasury for ?ye? receipt and payment of moneyes, and other continually to goe about to call and receaue such moneyes as daylie growe due. Sr Edwin Sandys said he considered in this buissines a two fold Ac?on the one of receauinge the other of payinge and was of opinion that these two would not coincidere: in reguard that it would many times happen, that at the same instant there must be moneys receaued and paid to diuers ?sons. Mr Wither said that he was of opinion that there must be added a Third Casheir in reguard that there would be an infinity of Bill? and specialities, receipt? and acquittances to be made wch would almost take vp one mans whole time. And whereas it was alledged that the Treasuror might imploye his owne Servant? that was not adiudged reasonable to require it: And whereas it was said that this matter and other Offices would be ?formed in great part for loue, and for the part publique benifitt, Sr Edwa: Sackuill said ?replyed? that he had heard great and worthie Merchant? ingenuously protest that their end was their owne private proffitt and not the publique good wch did belonge to publique ?sons and not to private men. Mr Io: Smith said that hauinge spent vpon Virginia a verie great mat- ter, he did by God? blessinge hope to receaue this yeare, a good quan- tity of Tobacco wch he would not willingly haue come vnder the hand? of them that would performe the buissines for loue and not vpon a good and competent Salary, and his opinion was, that the imploy- ment of these Salaries Casheires would be so great as they should be enforced to keepe Servant? vnder them, for from them must come the Instruc?ons to sue out Processe, Bill?, Informa?ons, Declara?ons. Cr. Wherevpon it beinge put to the question whither they thought it pos- sible that one Casheir cann ?forme the buissines of this charge, It was passed by a generall erec?on of hand? (saue onely one) that it was not possible: And beinge put to the question whither they held it necessarie to haue two Casheires it was generally agreed vnto. [162] After this was read the 4th Proposition wch was as followeth (vizt) There may be ten Co?ittees, whereof fower to be chosen by the Su?er Ilands Companie of the number of their Assistants and six by the Virginia Companie to each Co?ittee 20li Salary may be allotted. The Addi?on to the number of the Co?ittees was not disliked but for the Salary of 20li to each it was adiudged much too litle: ffor whereas by the Proiect they were to meete at least two dayes in the weeke, Sr Edward Sackuill said that that was but 11 grotes a daye, but he was of opinion that they should be enforced to meete so often as perhapps it would not come to 12d a daye. It was also said that men beinge in Trade whither Marchaunt? of ?or? Shoppkee?s could not spend so much time for so litle but very much to the preiudice and neglect of their estat?; wch when they should ?ceaue although they might ?happs at first beginn out of the abundance of conscience yet that would quickely faile and thinkinge themselues bound by a great bond of conscience to prouide for their owne charge will either negligently followe the buissines or el? ?happs seeke some indirect courses to satisfie themselues to the full of their paines and labor, wch reasons and diuers others beinge well considered of his lp: at length put it to the question whither the Companie did thinke Ten Co?ittees so salariated as in the Article is sett downe, would suffice to doe the buissines to the content of the Companie, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (onely two dissentinge) denied and disliked. §It was also put to the question whither they had rather haue 8: Co?- ittees with 50li a peece as was formerly ordered it was generally agreed.§ After this was read the fifte Article wch is as followeth (vizt:) There may six gentlemen be chosen indifferently out of both Companies wch may be in quality of Assistants to the Treasuror to whome no Sallary shalbe allotted, but in case the buisines proues by their industrie and good carriage profittable the Companie may with some smale gratuity testifie their good acceptance of their endeauors and also co?end them further to the Lord Treasuror of whome it may be hoped that he wilbe pleased to consent to giue such a moderate guift. Against this Proposition was obiected that instead of one Director there were six sett vp, wch kinde of forme would breed both infinite confusion in Counsell? and determina?ons and delay in execu?on of matters. [163] It was also said that the mayne part and substance of the buissines consisted in matter of proffitt and tradinge: In wch thing? Gentlemen beinge not expert, it was not conceaued, howe §they§ by their indus- trie and good carriage should so much aduance the buissines. It was also generally conceaued that the gentle? beinge of worth and giuinge continuall attendance, the gratuity men?oned could not be lesse then 100li a man whereby the charge would be much encreased. In the end his lp: put the Article to the question and by a generall erec?on of hand? it was disliked. After this was read the 6: Article wch is as followeth, to the Bookeeper there may be allowed 60li per Añu, to the Beadle 15li per Añu, To the Husband 15li per Añu. The abatement of allowance for the Bookeeper and Beadle were dis- liked, And for the matter of the Husband who must be a man of creditt and worth beinge to haue vnder his hand the whole Stocke and bound to giue continuall attendance, the allowance of 15li was adiudged that he must giue a Servant vnder him more Wherefore the Article beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? disliked, and on the contrary the Salaries propor?oned by the Companies well liked and approued. After this was read the 7th Article vizt To a Clarke for to waite wholly vpon that buissines 30li. And it was generally adiudged that it was impossible that one Clarke should suffice, and mr Deputy said that although the Secretary kept two men vnder him, yet he was not able so to ouercome the buissines of the Companie as that he might haue his attendance for the dispatch of buissines, Wherefore mr Deputy said he was forced as diuers of the Companie well knewe to keepe a Clarke at his owne charge; and for this buissines he said according to his vnderstandinge there would arise an infinite deale of writinge to him that had the Deputies place. In the end the Article beinge put to the question to haue on Clarke was by generall erec?on of hand? disliked. After this was read the 8: Article wch followeth (vizt) ffor a house wherein no man that hath a family should dwell but the Howskeeper 60li ? Añu or at most 80li sufficient Warehowse comprized therein: wch beinge put to the question it was [164] by a generall erec?on of hand? thought impossible that 80li a yeare should procure a fitt howse and sufficient Warehowse roome instance beinge made in the howse wherein the Court? at present are kept, for wch hath bin offered 100li ? Añu. and yet it is not capeable enough for the Companies vse for Court?: And as for Warehowse roome it was by diuers affirmed that 60li ? Añu more then belong? to the said howse would not suffice: Wherevpon the Article being put to the question was by a generall erec?on of hand? disliked. After this was read the 9th Article vizt To the Solicitor accordinge to the discretion of the Assistants and Co?ittees wch beinge put to the question was by a generall erec?on of hand? disliked. After this was read these words followinge The whole charge of offi- cers howse and Comittees will not amount to 600li at the Vttermost for Sallary and hows-rent so in this alone there is saued aboue 1200li ? Añu Concerning wch the Court declared their mind? that they made no question of his Mats Royall disposition in rewardinge of all that did him seruice but since by his Mats royall grace and the Lord Treasurors Noble fauor, the appointinge of Salaries and recompenc- inge of Officers that should take paines was left to the Companies owne iudgement, they were desirous to make vse of it without touch- inge his Matie or the Lord Treasuror and so this Article beinge put to the question it was by erec?on of hand? disliked. After this was read these word?: to all these officers I would haue an oath giuen: To wch answeare was made, that was ordered by the Companie in the Quarter Court, and the extraordinary Co?ittee beinge the Lord Lo: Cauendish ?Padgett?. mr Gibbs. Lo: Maynard. mr Wrote. Sr Edw: Sackuill. mr Io: Smith. Sr Io: Brooke. mr Robt: Smith. Sr Io: Dãuers. Sr Hen: Mildmay. desired to take it into their considera?on together with mr Deputy. After this was read these word? vizt And for that the importation of Spanish Tobacco is a mayne Branch of the Contract the Præamble may be altered so in fauor of the Aduenturers that many men may be encouraged to subscribe who nowe [165] forbeare by reason of the heard condi?ons proposed therein: Wherevpon mr Wilmott declared 3 exceptions that hindred him from writinge to the Roll, ffirst in that he did not conceaue that the bringinge in of the whole quantitie was certainely assured to the Aduenturers but onely the 40000 waight. And further that the bringinge in of the 40000 wtt was strictly tied to one yeares Terme and so the Aduenturers had not the same liberty as was by the Contract graunted to the Companie. Thirdly he desired that if the Companie would beare a part, they would giue better security then their Seale. Mr Mole also said that he conceaued that the matter of fower Shares and the lendinge of the Companie a Tenth part hindred many Aduen- turers: Herevpon the Roll was read and for mr Wilmotts doubt? it appeared plainely, that the Vndertakers of the first 40000 waight, if they would they might bringe in the rest excludinge all others and if not they might leaue it wch was conceaued a verie advantageable pointe vnto them. ffor the second it was declared that the Companies intent was to graunt these vndertakers as much liberty as themselues had and so it was in the begiñinge plainely expressed where it is said that they shall bringe in this yeare 40000 weight, if conveniently they may, and if they cannot bringe in the whole conveniently then as much thereof as they can conveniently. ffor mr Moles Obiec?ons it was aunsweared that if he could certainely saye that any considerable So?e would be brought in, if that clause of buyinge fower Shares were re?itted the Companie would consider of it, but otherwise without aduantage to alter it were but to shewe vnconstancy, and as for lendinge the Companies a Tenth part of the Stocke brought in since by other meanes, the Companie could not beare a part, the Aduenturers that had already vnderwritten had desired that clause, and without the Companies beare a part wth them they would withdrawe the So?es they had vnderwritten, wch diuers of them beinge present confirmed. After this the Article of the Roll was put to the question, that excepted that was before, It was by erec?on of hand? generally disliked. [166] After this the next Article wch followeth, To these may be added some Comittees at large and those of eminent quality and great Adventur- ers in one or both the Plantations to whome equall power and vote may be giuen with the other wch beinge read it was put to the question whither the Companie did like of that Article that superinduce ye Third order of the Co?ittee: The affirmatiue had no hand? the Neg- atiue all. The Court ordered to continue duringe pleasure. After this the Lord Cauendish takinge the Chaire and begininge a Su?er Ilands Court proposed vnto the Court all those seuerall Arti- cles wch had bin ?ticulerly examined and passed in the Virginia Court, and at the desire of the Court put them all to the question, the said Companie ratifyinge and confirming whatsoeuer the Virginia Com- panie had donn.1 1 Rough notes concerning these affairs are referred to in List of Records, No. 404, Vol. I, page 164, ante. The Su?er Iland? Court is likewise ordered to continue duringe pleasure. After this the Ea: of Southampton takinge againe the chaire read the next Article wch is as followeth And in case that part of the Contract be punctually obserued, that all the Tobacco be sold in Bancke, it wilbe necessary to drawe a Præamble to a second Roll whereby the Brothers of the Company may be admitted to subscribe what somes shall thereby be limited for the buyinge of the Tobacco wch poore Planters shall bringe into into this Kingdome, that they may not suffer by expectinge the sale of their good? and attendance for money: wch Sr Edwin San- dys said the Counsell and Co?ittees had taken that point often into their considera?on, and they conceaued it would not be donn but by Roll, but they had determined nothinge therein, but would with all seriousnes and were considered ?care consider? what course was to be held for the best aduantage and content of the Planter. After this was read the last part of mr Wrotes Proiect wch followeth, I could wish these pentions were changed into gratuities accordinge to the merrit of euery mans endeauors at the end of the yeare when the buissines is donn, and it plainely appeares that the Proiect aun- sweares expectation in pointe of proffitt: The course therein pro- pounded for gratuities was vtterly disliked it beinge contrary to the Contract with his Matie wherein it was agreed that the Officers should be rewarded by Salaries. [167] And herevpon Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to acquainte the Court howe by the Contract his Matie is to receaue his part at our lady day and Michalmas accordinge to the propor?ons that shalbe then receaued. Wherevpon there was a necessity of settinge downe the Salaries at the begininge for if they should be deferred till the later end all the charges would lye vpon the Tobacco that comes home last and the Sumer Ilands wch comes at the begiñinge of the yeare would passe free. Sr Edw: Sackuill said that seing? Salaries that haue bin so much talked of, continue but for one yeare and then both Salaries and Officers are newe to be chosen, he could not see what great inconveniences can followe the graunt if the worst fall out. But mr Moorer said the Salaries were dissorderly carried because the Salaries were first proposed and passed and afterward? the men chosen vnto them: But to this Sr Edward Sackuill replied that that shewed the contrary that they were fairely carried, for had the men bin first chosen, it might haue bin obiected that the Salaries were made the larger in fauor of the ?sons, but it being first passed before these ?sons were knowne, it was meerely in contempla?on of the paines and charge of the Office wch opinion the whole Court generally assented vnto. My Lo: of Sout?ton put it to the question whither they did concurr with mr Wrotes wish in this last part of his Proiect, the affirmatiue had no hand?, the Negatiue had all. Mr Rider moued that some speedie order might be taken for ready Sale of the poore Planters Tobacco: But he was aunsweared that no cer- taine order could as yet be made therein, but the Counsell and Co?it- tees would take it into their care and himselfe and all others were desired to consider what course they could finde. The Ea: of Southampton said that whereas mr Wrote brought a Proiect vnto the Court with an opinion of proposinge a better and thriftier waye for managinge the Tobacco: The Companie hauinge this day exactly examined by parts in euery perticuler haue with a generall consent dissallowed of them, saue onely in that clause that agrees with the former order. [168] After this the pa? presented by mr Binge in morninge on mr Wrots behalfe titled obiections against the salaries were read wch beinge put to the question by the Ea: of Southampton whither the Companie did thinke them worthie of further considera?on the affirmatiue had no hand? the Negatiue had all the hand?, The Coppie of wch writinge doth here ensue. Obiections agaynst the Sallarys.

Añu be too litle for a Comittee it may be encreased to 30li and onely eight Co?ittees may manage the buissines, if a greater Salary would binde the conscience I would yeald to it, but if conscience and honestie binde not neither will Salary: The same men that wthout Salary are said to haue vndonn the Plantation would scarcely haue bin honester for a pen?on, I intended it a Burthen to euery officer saue such as be seruant? because the imployment should not be desired but imposed In fine if wee hope his Matie should for his interest protect vs, wee must make as fewe Defalka?ons as may be and in my iudgement in a Doubtfull buissines whither it wilbe proffitt or losse wee should be moderate in layinge burdens vpon that is already fully laden for if the proiect proue of it selfe insupportable wth what argument? should ?all? wee be able to moue his most excellent Matie to releiue vs, and if by this encrease of charge it proue insupportable the blame wilbe imputed to our selues that by addinge waight to waight crush the Contract. ffor aunsweare to one Obiec?on, that where none is supreame the parity will produce confusion I say the Treasuror shall in quality of President moderate the buissines and assemble the Co?ittee. It is desired that this buissines of the Salary passe its tryall by the ballatinge box and that no salariated man though he hath giuen vp his pon?on be admitted to haue vote herein. Vpon the mo?on of the Lord Cauendish a Co?ittee is appointed and ordered to meete to morrowe morninge to read and examine whither the Patent? ordered to be drawne vp be so donn in the vsuall forme. Ea: of Southampton passed two Shares to mr George Garrett. Mr Iohn ffarrar passed ouer one Share to mr Robert Harley. Mr Iohn ffarrar passed one share to Elias Southerton. The Lord Cauendish mouinge that whereas mr Deputy stand? charged by mr Wrote with an accusa?on of false entringe a Court the 7° of October last that the same might be examined, and accordingly the Court declare their opinions therevpon, but it was thought fitt to be donn at the ?by a? Quarter Court, wherevnto the Accuser hath appealed. The Virginia Court beinge ended and the Lord Cauendish takinge againe the Chaire proposed vnto the Su?er Iland? Companie whither they did concurr in opinion with the Companie of Virginia touchinge mr Wrot? obiec?ons against the Salaries It was therevpon generally acknowledged by the whole Court that they did vtterly dislike it.

At this great and generall Court was first read the last Quarter Court held the Twentieth of Nouember ?last past? wch donn the Ea: of Southampton said that for the better informa?on of this great Court he thought it fitt that the whole proceeding? of the Companie touch- inge the Offices and Salaries and other ?ticulers wch of late haue bin so much questioñed and defamed should be defamed declared and manifested by readinge of those seuerall Court? wherein those point? were treated of, and desired the Companie to giue due attention both to the reasons themselues, and to the manner of those proceeding? [172] Wherevpon was first read the Virginia Court held vpon the Su?er Iland? Præparatiue Court day beinge the 22th of Nouember and after that was read the Virginia Court held on the Su?er Ilands Quar- ter Court daye, beinge the 27th of Nouember wch beinge donn, his lp: willed to respite the Court held the 4th of December (wherein mr Wrote with such violence burst out) to be read last; and so the Court held the 29th of Ianuary was read; and after that the Court held on the ffriday followinge purposely for the reveiwe and examina?on of the Court held the 4th of December; against the settinge ?downe? whereof mr Wrote had somewhat excepted: After that was read the Court held on Monday morninge the Third of ffebruary and after that, the Court held that day in the Afternoone beinge the Præparatiue Court: Next co?inge to the Court? held on Tuestday beinge the 4th of ffebrua: wch were held both forenoone and Afternoone and were onely for the consideringe and iudginge of the newe Proiect presented by mr Wrote, his lp againe desired their diligent atten?on that they might thereby be fully informed of the weakenes of mr Wrotes Proiect and howe substantiall the reasons and argument? were, for wch the Companie thought fitt vtterly to reiect it: Last of all was read the Court held the 4th of December, beinge ?fected by the Court held on ffriday the last of Ianuary, In the readinge whereof co?inge to that Clause where mr Wrote replyed he spake not against the Contract but meant only touchinge the Salaries, wch buissines he said was not co?- itted but carried fowly and disorderly and with much art, surrepti- tiously, and to private ends And that divers of the Companie did both then and since aswell publiquely as priuately in his hearinge com- plaine much against it but durst not speake their minds freely, because they were ouerawed: His lp willed that the word? might be read ouer againe wch be?ing? distinctly donn, he said that although he was absent at the begiñinge of the Præparatiue Court yet hauinge heard it read, that Sr Hen: Mildmay (amongst other thing?) did then deliuer that his mats pleasure was, that men should haue free liberty of speach, and that he intimated that his Matie had bin informed that they were ouerawed and durst not speake in these Court?, his lp: said it seemed verie strange vnto him yet because Sr Henry Mildmay had said it, he did beleiue it, but he must withall beleiue that it was through a great deale of misinforma?on and ?wondred? that there should any man be found so shameles to informe a Kinge of so falce a thinge and there- vpon appealed to the Court to beare wittnesse in this pointe whither they were ouerawed and durst not speake and whither they had [173] not so much freedome as themselues desired: The Court with a gen- erall voice and vnanimous consent professed that it was a false and vniust imputa?on, that they were ouerawed and durst not speake, and acknowledged to ?haue? enioyed such freedome and liberty of speach as was in no other Companie permitted and diuers said, that if men should vse but halfe the liberty of speach in perticuler Companies of this Citty or demeane themselues with that vnorderlines that diuers Brothers vsed in these Court? it would not be endured, but that they should be either punished in the purse or sent to the Counters. And because it grewe late and much buissines behinde, his lp: put to the question the continuance of the Court vntill the buissines neces- sary for that day might be dispatched And whereas also by order of the former Court there had bin warned in a Su?er Iland? Court to ioyne with the Virginia in such point? as should mutually concerne them both the Lord Cauendish propounded the begininge of that Court and the continuance of it so longe after six of the Clocke as need should require both wch were ordered by the Su?er Iland? Companie. These thing? beinge thus passed the Court held the 4th of December was read out, Wch beinge donn the Ea: of Southampton said that the report of these great distempers and indiscre?ons of mr Wrote related in that Court caused him i?ediately after to co?e vp out of the Country to prouide timely a remedie against the inconveniences that would followe vpon this distemper and to that purpose assembled the Counsell whither mr Wrote himselfe was warned, with whome he intended to proceed in all gentle and faire manner, such as might best bringe him to the acknowledgement of his error and to the reduceinge of him againe into the right waye: what the effect? thereof were, and howe mr Wrote behaued himselfe to the doublinge of his offence, his lp: said, the Act of Counsell would declare wch he willed to be read, wch was accordingly donne: And after some pause, his lp: de?aunded whither mr Wrote was in the Court, sayinge he did expect him there either to avouch or aproue the thing? that he had §spoken &amp;§ donne or el? to retract them, but mr Wrote appeared not. ?And? Sr Samuell Sandys said that a litle before as he was co?inge to the Court he mett mr Wrott cominge from the Court, and askinge him whither he went mr Wrote said he was verie ill at ease and could not staye. [174] The Lo Cauendish said that he remembred that mr Wrote had on the Monday appealed vnto the Kinge and to such Deligat? as his Matie should appointe, and supposed that he did persist in that resolu?on and therefore seemed to require the iudgement of those learned gen- tlemen that professed the studie of the lawe what in this case was to be donn. Wherevnto mr Brooke made aunsweare, that mr Wrote hauinge appealed, if either by sufficient testimony of any present, or by other good evidence it could be made appeare vnto the Court, that his Matie hath accepted of that appeale, then the Court was bound without any farther medlinge in the buissines to reserue the matter entire to his Maties pleasure from whome they deriued all the power and authority they haue, But seeinge neither mr Wrote himselfe appeared nor any other signified any such thinge, he did not conceaue that the Com- panie was any waye debarred by his pretended appeale (wch beinge not accepted was as nothinge) from proceedinge in a due and legall manner accordinge to the power graunted vnto them by his Mats Let- ters Patent? wch opinion was generally confirmed, and therevpon the Court desired that mr Wrotes buissines might be handled. Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to declare that as in many things he did much differ in opinion from mr Wrote, so in nothinge more then in the State of this buissines, ffor he was farr from conceauinge that mr Wrote was accused &amp; prosecuted, but contrariwise thought it verie apparant that he was the persecutor and Accuser: Hee had accused the principall managers of this Contract with his Matie of Arte and priuate end?, the Co?ittees he had blamed for disorder and negligence, the Counsell he had traduced for improuidence and indiscre?on, the Court? for vsurpinge an vnlawfull power, our Noble Gouernor for ouerawinge the Court?, in So?e the whole proceeding? in this buissi- nes he had condemned for foule disorderly and surreptitious; where by the waye to cleere the question whither the Quarter Court should transmitt a Derivatiue power to another Court, he said, that true it is, that there are some things by the Letters Patents absolutely lym- itted to a Quarter Cort wch cannot be transferred to any other as the disposinge of land?, the makinge of lawes, the choise of principall Officers with some other matters of like important quality, wherein the power of a Quarter Court cannot be deriued to any other Court but for the setlinge of those smale differences then dependinge between the Lord Treasuror and the Companie the Quarter Court might [175] transmitt the power thereof to another Court wch in fine wrought no other effect then this, then that the Act? of that Court ?should be of that authority? as not to be reversed by any other then a Quarter Court: The proceeding? and resolu?ons of wch Court: mr Wrote hav- inge questioned with so great acerbity of speach as also the Act? of the Counsell and Co?ittees together with the demeanor of his lp: and other ?sons of qualitie it could not be otherwise conceaued then to be a direct Accusa?on and consequently that mr Wrote bare the part of the Accuser, And therefore for him to appeale from his owne Accu- sa?on was somewhat a strange course and before not heard of, seeinge no Appeale could be but a Gravamine for as for his suspen?on he said it was only for his contempt toward? the Counsell and noe other mis- deamenors so that he hath not bin ?sequuted thereby, (as he com- plaines) but hath bitterly and vniustly persequuted others, for if his Accusa?on haue bin iust and well grounded why doth he forsake it nowe the daye of Tryall is come, the daye of that Court to wch himselfe appealed, the ?sons by him accused stand here in the face of the Court, submittinge themselues to the Tryall by him desired, they expect their Accuser, hauinge hoped that he would haue come in like a braue gentleman and iustified those false §foule§ asper?ons where- with he had charged them, but Innocency and Trueth he said, were bold and setled whereas calumnies and vntruthes were fearefull and fugitiue. Hee further said that of all his calumnies and Accusa?ons there was none more vniust, nor more apparantly vntrue then that wherewith he had charged (though not by name yet by necessarie inference) my Lo: of Southampton himselfe, namely that the Companie were so ouerawed that their liberty of speakinge was taken awaye from them, nowe what mischief? haue ensued herevpon euery man might appre- hend, for it appeared by Sr Henry Mildmayes speach, that his Ma eares haue bin possessed therewith, euen as mr Wrote with his frend? and familiar hath filled all part? of the Citty and Country with like causeles clamors and brought great scandall vpon the Companie, wch wrong? so great, so vniust and so ?nitious, if they should be suffred to continue and proceed wthout repressinge them, he sawe not but the whole gouerment of the Companie must withall dissolue and fall into extreame scorne, contempt, and confusion. The Ea: of Southampton said that he could not without some pitty thinke on the extreame trouble and vexa?on that one mans vnrulines in his speach, and dissorderly carriage had brought vpon the whole [176] Companie, hauinge forced them to keepe so many Court? daye after daye, and that of so longe continuance and vnseasonablenes as good part? of the night? haue bin taken vp by them and that not about matters of waight neither in his cause but onely for ye satisfyinge of his friuolious friuolous exceptions and cauell? and debatinge and answearinge of his impertinent and absurd Propositions Wherefore he supposed the Court should do verie well by a iust censure of so many enormities and excesses to preuent the like occasion of misde- meanor and molesta?on to themselues hereafter otherwise he did not see but another man might be encouraged by the impunity of this fact, to do as much the next Court, whereby the Companie should be quite tired out and the whole buissines be vtterly ouerthrowne; for such was the malignancy of this passage, that for full eight week? it had hindred all other proceeding?. Sr Iohn Dãuers said that hauing seen mr Wrote present himselfe since the sittinge of the Court, and afterward? findinge that he had with- drawne himselfe, it seemed plaine to him, that he had deserted his cause wch he sawe he could not mainetaine, and therefore he did not thinke it fitt to loose any longer time in expectinge him but to pro- ceed to the sentencinge of him, but yet before that was donn he thought it fitt that those imputa?ons charges and accusa?ons wch mr Wrote had laid vpon the proceedings of the Counsell and Companies in the buissines of the Contract, and perticulerly of the Salaries, should be propounded to the iudgement of the Court; (vizt) whither they did approue all or any of them to be true wch course was well liked: Wherevpon his lp: put it to the question whither they did not thinke that those exceptions charges imputa?ons and Accusa?ons laid by mr Wrote were not false and slaunderous, It was by a generall erec?on of hand? adiudged that they were false and slaunderous noe one dissentinge. After this Sr Henry Mildmay stood vp desiringe liberty and fauor for a worde or two, ffirst he desired this honoble Companie would not thinke that he hath bin the instrument to stirr vp stormes but one that hath endeauoured to allaye them And whereas he vpon the Mon- day before declared ?deliuered? his aduise as from himselfe vnto the Companie vpon some conference [177] he had with the Kinge touch- inge certaine point?, he was informed some made a question, whither he had warrant to deliuered what he then did: Hee thought good therefore nowe to signifie, that whatsoeuer he intimated before vnto them he had nowe warrant from his Matie who by waye of aduise and Counsell, but no waye to co?aund them wished That verball differ- ences may be left, and the busines of the Plantation goe on. Wherevpon the Earle of Southampton said that for the matter of dif- ferenc? they were nowe about to laye them aside and to make such an end as they might goe indeed forward with the buissines of the Planta?on wch had bin verie longe and sorely interrupted: But if it were his Mats pleasure, they should not meddle with any evill word? or evill behauior they would all obey: Sr Henry Mildmay answeared, he had no co?aund, at all from his Matie but onely warrant to speake what he nowe had deliuered by way of aduise Sr Edward Sackuill said that to proue a trueth one of the best eui- dences is to haue one and the same thinge and ?auerred? by double testimony that Sr Henry Mildmay hath in substance faithfully deliu- ered his Mats most gracious answeare message he can, knowingly affirme and wittnesse for it beinge feared that some had endeau- ored to preiudicate his Mats good opinion with sinister rela?ons of the proceeding? of this Companie he did out of his zeale to trueth and the duety he owed to this Society, mediate for accesse whereby he might enioye the meanes as he did the minde to rectifie such misinforma?ons and remoue vniust impressions if any such haue bin harboured in his royall brest but truly he could not finde that there were any: onely that his Matie had bin pleased out of his to send a Message then irrevocable, by reason he beleiued it was already deliuered it beinge then about three of the Clocke wch in essence and effect did correspond and accord with this nowe i?ediately related, namely that at last his Matie invited vs to forsake words and fall to Actions and at last to end to talke and begin to doe, wch would most advance his service and conferr the greatest benifitt vnto the Collony vnto wch he wished all happines. The Companie did with generall voice acknowledge much ioye and thankfullnes to his Matie for his so royall care and remembrance of them and their affaires and that after such a manner as they professe neuer to haue receaued a greater fauor And therefore it was generally desired by the Court, that to make a finall end of these matters that had so longe interrupted and diverted them that accordinge to his Mats graceous aduise and Counsell they might fall to ac?on &amp; dispatch the buissines nowe in hand without any further circumstances or delay. [178] Wherevpon mr Christofer Brooke said that since the waye to bringe it to an end was to fall to it, he would first beginn, And first he said that by that wch had bin declared against mr Wrote he did not per- ceaue that he had accused but abused the Court and all those other parties wch he sought to disgrace and that in such a manner as might not be let passe vnpunished, for as it is true that a President doth more good then many precepts so an ill example in a Companie or Society doth much more hurt as for the lawe he said it is plaine that if a man enfranchised in any Companie shall speake against the good thereof he may be disfranchised but if he shall contemptuously behaue or carrie himselfe against ye Gouernor or Gouerment thereof he is subiect to fine and imprisonment and although it was plaine that mr Wrote had in both these kind? offended in a verie high manner, for his word? and behauior both to the Counsell and Companie had bin extreamely contemptuous, and his mo?ons, attempt? and practises full of indiscre?on and of euill consequence, as did maynely endanger the ouerthrowe of the Companies and Planta?ons and wherein there was certainely manifested a great deale of ill will yet because the word? would not directly beare it, he would not therefore touch vpon his ffreehold in Virginia by disfranchisinge him, but would aduise rather that mr Wrote (hauinge so exceedingly misdemeaned himselfe) ?should? by the Court, wch as it had power to choose so likewise it had power to depriue, be put of and excluded for euer from beinge any more of the Counsell and further that he should be suspended from cominge to the Court? till he looked into his owne error and made submission. The Lo: Cauendish said mr Wrote had shewed an ill affec?on to the treaty of the Contract since the very first begiñinge thereof for beinge (before the Contract came to Proposition) a dilligent Attender at Court?, he since that time often absented himselfe from Court? and from the meetings of the Counsell and Co?ittee where that buissines was handled and because he would not giue his consent, he therefore would giue no aduise: And whereas before it his duety as a Coun- sellor to haue assisted with his Counsell and helpe for the preparinge and ordered of such waightie and important point? he refused and neglected it, although he were ?ticulerly warned to their meeting?, but when thing? were passed and ordered and could not be revoaked then with strange violence and vnorderlynes vnder [179] pretence of zeale and care of the Publique good, he did in all places publiquely and priuately call in question the Act? and proceeding? of the Coun- sell Comittees and Companie defaminge and deprauinge them with as many virulent asper?ons as a foule mouth and an ill heart could deuise, neither was his mallice bounded in these passages onely but runinge out to other matters he made heauy challenges and laid foule crimes vpon some of the principall Officers in the Company with an intent onely to slaunder them, for as they had seen, he refused and withdrewe when he should come to the pointe. His lp: further said, he obserued his offences in that Court of the 4th of December to be three: ffirst his exception against an order in the Spanish Roll, where the Companie are to beare a Tenth part: Touch- ing wch hauinge refused formerly to giue his aduice although he were warned to the meeting? of the Counsell and Co?ittees where that buissines was largely and fully debated; yet after it was by the Act of both Companies in their Quarter Court? concluded and agreed, he in that ordinary Court beinge told that it could not be altered beinge warned that it might extreamely preiudice the Companies, would not forbeare to dispute against it, nor would keepe any order, but speake as often as he listed, and to the intent the better reasons ?wth? wch he was aunsweared might not frustrate their feares and discourage- ment? wch he laboured to instill into the Companies mind?, he did not only confidently avouch the Lawes of the Realme to be agreeable to his opinion, but falsely (as by his owne confession afterward to the Counsell appeared) affirmed that he had asked the Counsell of the Lawyers ?ticulerly concerninge that pointe to make this evill sineke ?ye? deeper and that this was donne not out of present passion and heat, but vpon premeditate inten?on to raise a Combustion, His lp: said he was the more confirmed therein because at that Court he obserued, diuers whome he had not of a longe time before seen in Court? and was generally knowne and obserued not to appeare or shewe their faces but against a storme and Tempest: Secondly in that Court wch mr Wrotes wronginge ye Counsell and that in a high manner, in generall the Co?ittees and Companie, all whome together with the Gouernor he depriued not onely of want of wisedome and iudgement to contriue and consult of thing? but of want of care duely to consider and prepare them; and lastly of honesty it selfe; for all these things doe the word? wch he then spake not only imply but directly and plainely charge, he sayinge that thing? were not fairely carried but fowly and with much art surreptitiously, and to priuate end? and that the Companie durst not speake their minds because they were ouerawed: So that there was neither wisedome nor care; nor [180] nor honestie nor good meaninge: and although with a protesta?on post fact?, he would seeme to turne it from the Ea: of Southampton himselfe, and the rest of the Counsell; yet the truth was, that those accusa?ons could setle nowhere el?, for the Ea: of Southampton himselfe and the Counsell were not onely consentinge, but Actors and the chiefe and principall in all those passages wch mr Wrote had thus censured, and herevpon his lp: tooke occasion out of the Court book? themselues to demonstrate howe duely howe orderly and howe fairely, all thing? had aswell in the Counsell &amp; Co?ittees, as in the Court?, been carried, howe maturely they were prepared, howe iuditiously debated howe freely propounded to the Court? howe men were invited to speake freely their mind? concerninge them, howe those that made obiec?ons were not onely patiently heard but thanked. The third offence wch mr Wrote co?itted in that Court was vnder a pious pretence of the poore Planters good, to laye a founda?on and groundworke to nourish a discontent and dislike in the Planters mind? concerninge the Contract and the Companies, and to sett him- selfe vp for a Champion and Patron of them, as though the Companie were negligent of their good or purposed to opresse them and so to raise a mutiny: Besid? his lp: said he would lay the heauier censure vpon him for goeinge with so false an Accusa?on to the Kinge, as implyinge that they were ouerawed and durst not Speake, wch could come from no man but mr Wrote: And therefore seeinge his Matie so much desired an end of these differences, his lp: conceaued, it could not better or sooner be ?formed then by cuttinge of so vnworthie a Member. Wherevpon his lp: said that he affirmed the former censure of the Counsell and nowe his opinion was that mr Wrote be excluded and put of from beinge of the Counsell, neuer to be admitted thereof againe: Secondly that mr Wrote be disfranchised from the Companie as an vnworthie member, Thirdly that Cautions be giuen to all suc- ceedinge Gouernors that they ?mitt not mr Wrote againe to steppe into the Companie. Sr Edward Sackuill said that he would not nowe stand to anatomize the carriage of mr Wrote seeinge the Lord Cauendish had so fully donn it, As for the censure wch his lp: was of opinion should be laid vpon him, he said that if mr Wrotes present behauior were onely con- sidered he was of opinion, that the censure was farr vnder the merrit of his demerritt, but he had both heard and seen that mr Wrote had formerly donn good seruice for the [181] Companie: Wherefore although he was nowe an infected Member, yet because he might ?happs become good againe, his opinion was that he should be dis- composed from beinge of the Counsell &amp; suspended from the Court? vntill he make his submission. Sr Iohn Dãuers said that he cannot remember much merritt in mr Wrote for matter of Counsell and therefore would conclude him with- out returninge that he should neuer more be of the Counsell: Sec- ondly his opinion was that he should be suspended from cominge to Court? vntill he shall acknowledge yt his sentence is iust and fault great and that in a Quarter Court: And further because of his many appeales and threatnings heretofore openly in Court and el? where of prosecutinge his ill inten?on some other wayes if he shall not from hence forward desist those indirect courses, his mo?on was that mr Wrotes proceeding? together with the Companies sentence should be put in print for the iustifica?on of the Companie. Sr Lawrence Hide said he was sorrie to heare a man of that sufficiency as mr Wrote had shewed, co?itt so great a fault as to be guilty of mutiny and so great obstinately §to§ ?sist in so bad a course, he hauinge bin offered so many meanes both from the Counsell and Companie to see and a?end his error withall he feared his fact is such as some others of the Company haue bin infected thereby and therefore for examples sake and that this his censure might be a Terror vnto others, he held it fitt he be excluded for euer both from the Counsell and Company without acceptinge of any submission or acknowledgement at all howe great soeuer. Herevpon the Ea: of Southampton said, that seeinge the opinions were somewhat different, he would propound a middle waye touching his suspen?on from the Counsell ?Company?, namely that it might be for a time vntill he shall submitt him selfe and not absolutely for euer, In the end after some dispute it was thought fitt to make a question: ffirst therefore his lp: putting to the question whither mr Wrote should be put of and excluded for euer from beinge of the Counsell; It was by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) concluded and ordered that he should be put of and excluded for euer from the Counsell. Secondly my Lord put it to the question whither the Companie would haue mr Wrote disfranchised or suspended as had bin proposed, It was by plurality of hand? agreed that he should be onely suspended. [182] Thirdly his lp: put it to the question whither his suspen?on should be absolute for euer has had bin propounded or whither after a cer- taine time vpon his submission he might not be admitted the question beinge put it was by a generall erec?on of hand? agreed his suspention should not be for euer. ffourthly it was put to the question whither his suspen?on should be lefte indifferently vntill he shall submitt, or whither he should be absolutely suspended for one whole yeare, wherein his submission though he offered it should not be accepted: It beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? ordered and agreed, that in reguard he had neglected that time, (wherein he might haue made his peace if he had submitted himselfe) he should therefore be excluded for one whole yeare entirely, wherein his submission should not be accepted although he should offer it: But at the yeares end if he shall then make his submission to the next Quartr Court followinge in such good manner as shalbe fitt, that then it is left to the pleasure of the Quarter Court to read?itt §but§ without due submission it was ordered he should neuer be admitted. Lastly vpon Sr Iohn Dãuers mo?on that in case mr Wrote notwith- standinge his iust censure, shall persist in his willfull opinion and courses to cast asper?ons vpon the Company and Court? or any way wronge or molest them, directly or indirectly, then to cause his sen- tence wth a Declara?on of his proceeding? be put in print; wch mo?on beinge well aproued of, was put to the question, and by a generall erec?on of hand? ordered accordingly. Vpon mo?on it was generally agreed and ordered that Sr Robert Kil- ligrewe should be of the Co?ittee in stead of mr Wrote nowe sus- pended. Sr Edward Sackuill said that although it was vnseasonable yea almost vnmannerly to abuse the patience of this Court wth longer discourse, their eares beinge already harried and wearied with too much noise of this kinde, yet he would presume a litle further on it, beinge engaged by promise to impart this night what he had to trouble them with, and hoped easely pardon, since it tend? either to ?the their? Honor or their proffitt, if not to both: Meetinge of late casually with Sr Thomas Smith (who once and that longe had bin the Primus moter in this Companie) he addressed [183] himselfe vnto him seeminge much discontented at the professions he had heard Sr Edward had made in diuers places of his beinge in debt to the Companie, he beinge one, that vsed not to deny what he had said, and co?only to speake what he think? Sr Edward said he confessed it true that he had spoken to others as much as was informed him by persons of good worth and vnderstandinge whome as yet he had no cause to discreditt: Where- vpon Sr Thomas professed his integrity and innocency, and amongst many Argument? he vsed two wch most moued ?wth? Sr Edward?: one that if he were indebted so much as was imputed why did the Com- panie that pretended necessity forbeare thus longe to beginn to recouer it, he beinge able to make satisfac?on: Next Sr Thomas Smith pro- tested he had diuers times importuned an auditinge of his Account?, wch by the space of three yeares he could neuer yet obtaine, though for his part he had deliuered in all his book? whereby to taxe him; There was then present two gentlemen of good worth and reputa?on Sr Humfrey Handford nowe Sheriffe and one mr Abdy a rich mar- chant that confirmed as much addinge they had by assent of the Court and vpon oath examined his Account?, and in the ballancinge of them, found the Companie to owe vnto Sr Thomas Smith fiue hundred and odd pound? wch they had wittnessed vnder their hand? and deliuered vnto this Court: Herevpon Sr Thomas Smith desired he might goe ?on? with peace into his graue beinge already farr stricken in yeares, wch alone must shortly period his dayes, were it not accompanied with many other infirmities incident to age; the paines whereof, though many times they much tormented and afflicted him were nothinge in comparison of those wherewith his good name and reputa?on stood affected by these iniurious and vniust asper?ons espeacially proceed- inge from thence whome he had hoped to haue merited by his many yeares paines a better returne and acknowledgement: Sr Edward Sackuill therefore said, to deny this request of his was meere iniustice and to delay it but hard iustice, wherefore he beseeched the Court to appoint some with expidi?on to put a finall end to this buissines by liquida?on of his Account?, and by the verity of them, lett him stand or fall, till then (he said) himselfe and euery man are bound in Charity to hope the best and in honestie to condemne no man that that fairely put? himselfe to his tryall, and by this waye proffitt will redound to the Companie if there be any thinge due, and if not it is for their honor to giue him a Quietus est. [184] Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys said that he conceaued the office of the Auditors was not to make an Account but to examine it, but the Audi- tors after longe and great labor taken in ?vsinge and considering of the Account exhibited by Sr Thomas Smith haue found the same so defectiue, disorderly and intricate as it can hardly merritt the name of an Account, beinge many wayes faulty and altogether vnexaminable wch he spake not (as he said) to laye any asper?on vpon the reputa?on of Sr Thomas Smith, further then of neglect and that through multi- tude of buissines: ffor the world knewe that Sr Thomas Smith neither kept the Account? nor made them, but to satisfie Sr Tho: Smith him- selfe that the fault of not auditinge was not in the Auditors, but in the Account? he had in writinge ready to shewe certaine waightie exceptions formerly taken against them wch yet he desired not to be read openly in Court beinge prepared onely for the present veiwe of my Lord of Southampton, who had oftentimes moued the Auditors for dispatch of those Account?: Notwithstandinge, my Lo of South- ampton desired they would proceed to doe something therein, and if they finde them bottomeles, then to certifie Sr Thomas Smith what the defect? be wch was promised should be donn wth as much expidi?on as other buissines would ?mitt. His lp: moued that these followinge might be admitted of the Counsell in respect of their worth and sufficiency vizt Lo: Maynard. Col: Ogle. Lo: D'Lawarr. Lo: Gen9all Veere. Sr Lawr: Hide Knight. All wch beinge put to the Question were by a generall erec?on of hand? admitted accordingly. These 3: Patent? examined and compared in the morninge by a Co?ittee appointed by the former Court were put to the question and approued and order giuen for the sealinge of them. ?viz? Patent to Capt: Io: Martin Patent to mr Arthur Leuellis Patent to mr Haberly and James Haberly his Sonne. [185] These Comissions followinge were all put to the question and ordered to be sealed (vizt) Comission graunted to mr Richard Mitton mr of the Abraham of Topsom first for transporta?on of Passengers and after for a fishing voyage. The like to mr Richard Curtis mr of the Mary Margaret of Topsom first for transporta?on of Passengers and after to goe a fishinge. The like Comission to mr Gabriell Barbor for the Bonny Besse of London of about fower score Tuñ for transporta?on of Passengers and after for a ffishinge voyage. The like was graunted to mr Richard Quaile mr of the Ann of Vir- ginia for transporta?on of passengers and after for a ffishinge voyage. Vpon the mo?on of mr Arthur Swayne and mr Wm Constable a Com- ission was graunted to mr 1 1 A blank space in the manuscript.

This daye was held the Quarter Court for the Su?er Iland? wch hauinge dispatched their perticuler buissines, The Ea: of Sout?ton said that he had somethinge to acquaint them concerninge the Con- tract; wherefore as also in reguard that the Virginia Quarter Court had referred the confirma?on or reforma?on if a better course could be propounded of the Sallaries and manner of managinge the Contract he therefore moued that in reguard these thing? equally concerned both Companies, the Virginia Companie whereof a large number had very longe attended in the Parlours might be called in, and these point? propounded and debated together with them, for so by the addi?on of many able and wise ?sons the matter would be the more fuller and soundly debated, and more fairely and iudiciously concluded, and this course was so much the more seasonable because all the Su?er Iland? Companie except some ?saue? one or twoe were free of the Virginia Companie. Wherevpon the Ea: of Southampton takinge the Chaire signified vnto both Companies that the Contract wch had so longe hunge in suspence was nowe againe sent signed by the Lord Treasuror without any alter- a?on [187] at all from that wch was formerly agreed on by the Quarter Court? and that the Lords of his Mats Priuy Counsell hauinge bin acquainted by the Lord Treasuror with the Contract did verie well approue thereof Onely one thinge he was to signifie vnto them from the Lord Treasuror touchinge the Proclamation wch by the Articles was to be presently graunted; wch for some waightie reasons, no waye preiudiciall to the Companies, the Lord Treasuror desired might be respited for 3 or 4: Moneths only: after wch time the Lord Treasuror promised there should be such a one graunted vnto them as themselues desired and in the meane while said that the Companies might make vse of the Proclamation graunted to the former Patentees, and besid? they should i?ediately haue his lp Letters written to all the Port? in England in so effectuall a manner as the Proclama?on it selfe should not worke more to their benifitt: The same course likewise should be held for Ireland by verie effectuall letters written to the Lord Deputy to prohibite the plantinge of Tobacco there, and to forbidd the impor- ta?on of any, but such as by the Companies should be brought in: Wherefore by these good Supplies the Lord Treasuror conceaued, the want of Proclamations for so smale a time as is desired could be no preiudice at all vnto them, but the forbearance thereof was for some important reasons of State absolutely necessarie.1 1 The order of the Privy Council for the Contract is mentioned in List of Records, No. 406, Vol. 1. page 164, ante. This the Ea of Southampton said was the Proposi?on wch he was to offer vnto the Companies from the Lord Treasuror wherefore he desired them to take it into their considera?on whither they might giue waye vnto it or noe. Wherevpon mr Deputy said that if the Companies had so earnestly desired the Proclamation onely to the intent to debarr the Importa?on of Tobacco by any but themselues, the delay thereof for so short a while as was propounded (the want of it beinge otherwise to be so well supplied) might in his opinion be yeilded vnto, but he said that in the first treaty of that pointe the countenance and reputa?on wch the Companie should receaue by so publique a Declara?on of his Ma graceous fauor and loue to them in graunting them the sole Importa?on was a motiue that exceedingly swaide with the Companies: and nowe on the Contrary the want thereof as it would much discourage them, so ?happs it would disgrace them. Sr Edwin Sandys said there neuer hauinge bin any restraint in Ireland for the Importa?on of Tobacco, it would be verie difficult without a Proclamation to doe any good there. [188] But neither this nor mr Deputies reasons were adiudged of such force as therefore the Contract should not be proceeded in, by deny- inge to yeald to the Lord Treasurors request: Wherefore after some considera?on of the Proclamation graunted to the former Patentees whereof it was adiudged there might be made good vse, and after much dispute and many mo?ons made for obtayninge a longer time for bringinge in of the Spanish Tobacco and that the payment? should not begin vntill the Proclamation should come forth and diuers other such like wch were all reiected as thing? of no great moment, and wch perhapps would much distast the Lord Treasuror, the Compa: desired his lp: to put it to the question wch was donn in this manner vizt: Whither the Company would conclude this bargaine notwithstandinge the delaye of the Proclamation vpon my Lo: Treasurors promise that they shalbe strengthned with all other helpes both for this Kingdome and Ireland: Provided they may haue the Proclamation wch hath bin already offered by the Companies and approued by mr Atturney or some other to as good effect before the 20th day of Iune next, and this condi?on to be inserted in the Letters Patent? This by a generall erec?on of hand? with an vnanimous consent of the whole Court was approued no one dissentinge. This buissines thus concluded the Ea: of Southampton desired them to proceed with the other buissines concerninge the manner of managinge the Contract and the Salaries against wch so many and bitter exclama?ons had bin made by some as thing? most vniust and vnreasonable. But diuers that had heretofore professed themselues against these point?, moued that because it was nowe verie late the considera?on and disputinge of them might be referred to a farther time, some sayinge they were not fully prepared, others that they would treat of it in a Su?er Iland? Court ?only? and not in the presence of the Vir- ginia Companie: Some said that although they were members of the Virginia Companie yet hauinge there no other Aduentures then their land and lookinge for no good? they would not meddle one waye or other therein as members of the Virginia Companie, for since the Salaries was to be raised vpon the good? they did not thinke it fitt to medle with imposinge any charge, whereof themselues should not beare a part, wherefore as in a Virginia Court they would say nothinge but in a Su?er Iland? Court, in wch Planta?on they were verie deepely engaged they would declare themselues freely: [189] To these last mr Deputy aunsweared that he hoped the bond of that oath wch they had taken as Counsellors for Virginia would away as much with them to assist with their Counsells and good reasons if they had any, to prevent the da?age of the Plantation in Virginia if they conceaued any likely to followe by theis Sallaries as their private estat? and proffitt? should for the Su?er Iland?: But for those other that required further time, he said, it seemed wonderfull strange to him that men that had raised such straunge stormes and Tempest? concerninge the Sallaries, not onely to the disreputa?on of the Companies proceeding? but much to the hinder- ance of the Planta?on it selfe and to the vtter disgraceinge and defaminge of some verie worthie persons, hauinge sought to make them infamous not onely in this Citty, but through the whole King- dome and onely for accepting of these Salaries, that after all this mischiefe donn they should be yet vnprepared wth plaine and euident reason to ouerthrowe the Salaries he could not sufficiently mervell and that the more because he sawe before his eyes some of them who in the Court the 11th of December when the considera?on of the Sal- aries was referred to this present day said that they would against that time fortifie themselues to cut the Throat of the Salaries: Wherefore he desired them verie earnestly without any longer delay- inge to bringe forth those waightie reasons for wch they haue so much traduced and defamed this matter. Herevpon some said that the two great Salaries were too high, that the seruice that should be this yeare donn in sellinge of the Tobacco could not deserue such ffees, for perhapps the Tobacco would be sold most of it in great ?cell? by the Candle. Sr Edwin Sandys said that hauinge surrendred his place, wch he verie seriously protested he would not againe accept, he would speake freely what he thought, he said that he conceaued this buissines to be one of the most difficult and intricate that in the like kinde had bin euer attempted: and that the matter of sellinge the Tobacco was one of the least part? of the buissines as had bin well declared in a writinge presented to the Counsell and Co?ittees before the Quarter Court wherein the Offices were propounded and passed, for although that care and labor should be much eased if the Sales Should passe so in great ?cell? as was propounded, yet it could not be but that much would remayne behinde, whereof there must be daylie sellinge, but this was the Comittees labor propperly, the [190] Directors and Deputies and Treasurors would be a continuall and endles labor from the keepinge out of bringinge in Tobacco vnduly, the attendance of the Lord Treasuror, the aunswearinge and satisfyinge of so many hundreth of people as would be interessed in this buissines, the pro- por?oninge of mens Diuident? wch would be often to be made and that verie intricate considering that the buissines depended vpon many and very indifferent Account? and part? wch yet must all be reduced to one vnity of Ac?on: These seuerall part? he said besid? an infinite number of lesser ac?ons were so many as the performance of them did amaze him when he considered of them, so that he did not thinke that any two mens sufficiencie for vnderstandinge nor hability for bodily paines could suffice to the ?formance of all these thing? wthout a great deale of other good help. Sr Henry Mildmay moued because it was nowe growne very late that the agreement about the Salaries might be deferred till the next Quarter Court vntill his Maties pleasure were further knowne whither he would giue allowance of so great a propor?on or noe: but for the present he held it altogether vnfitt to be concluded vpon. Wherevnto Aunsweare was made that there was a necessity of resolu- inge vpon Officers and Sallaries nowe at this present because all the Tobacco would be come home from the two Plantations before the next Quarter Court; and therefore if in the meane time no Officers be appointed for managing of the Tobacco when it shall come home, the buissines would be vtterly neglected and both the Kinge and Companies will thereby be much preiudiced in pointe of proffitt. As for further seekinge to his Matie since it pleased him (as by the Articles appeared) to referr the appointinge of Sallaries to the Court? consideringe they were to beare two Third? to his Maties one that was adiudged altogether needles ?for? hauing by the Lord Treasurors fauor obtayned that grace why should they not accordingly make vse of it accordinge as themselues should finde most benificiall for the aduancement of the buissines. Mr Alderman Iohnson said that it was to be considered what coue- nant? and explana?ons the Agent? will enter into to free the Com- panie from the Contract wth his Matie touchinge the Spanish Tobacco, he said he found no fault with the Salaries but with the greatnes of them in grosse beinge 2500li for he said if a [191] smale quantitie of Tobacco comes home that must be charged for any thinge appeares to the contrary with the whole So?e of 2500li And on the other side if ready Chapmen be found to take of this Tobacco when it doth come home by a Iointe Stocke what shall these Sallary men then deserue: Hee therefore concluded that it were fitt for the faire and safe car- riage of the buissines that there be a Tripertite Indenture drawne between the Kinge and the Companies and the Vndertakers and that there should be a stinte sett downe howe much should be laid vpon euery pound of Tobacco. To this last pointe it was answeared that there could not be any cer- taine So?e nowe sett downe, but that was to be left till hereafter, when if great quantities come in, the burthen would be the lesse, if but smale quantities then there must be the more laid vpon the pound of Tobacco in Wch case it was verie certaine that the addi?on of greater charge for the raisinge of the So?e propounded could not be so much but that it would be manifoldly repaide by the aduaneement of the price of Tobacco for it was certaine that if the quantitie of Tobacco should be but smale, it would be sold at a verie high rate. Sr Nath: Rich moued that the Virginia Companie would deferr their resolu?on of the Salaries vntill the Su?er Iland? Companie haue con- sidered thereof and agreed therevpon, for he hoped that it twas not intended that these of the Su?er Iland? Companie should haue the same burden laid vpon them as vpon the Virginians consideringe their Companie is but smale, their debt? great, and their Supplies and other charges are and haue bin of late yeare exceedinge burdensome. 1 In reguard the Virginia Tobacco will beare a better price then the Su?er Iland? Tobacco that therefore the matter of charge be not made equall but propor?onable. 2 That the charge of imposi?ons be made certaine vpon the pound, be the quantitie more or lesse that comes in, that both the Planter and Aduenturer may knowe the vttermost of his charge. 3 Aunsweare was made that the last of these point? were formerly aunswered: As for the other the case of Virginia was held to be as hard this yeare as the Su?er Iland? could be and therefore the bur- then must be equall. [192] Mr Alderman Iohnson at last offred in writinge these Propositions followinge. vizt. PROPOSITIONS To the Honorable Courte of Sommer Islands for the better performance of the Contract wth his Maty and in behalfe of the sayde Plantation.1 1 The caption of this document is in the handwriting of Nicholas Ferrar. Right Honoble for avoydinge of troublesome or offensiue speach to this Honoble Court, and the multiplica?on of many words and exceptions against the Salaries as they nowe stand propounded, or against the parties intended for managinge the sale of our Su?er Ilands Tobacco, it is thought convenient by the Author himselfe breifely to propound in writinge these reasonable proposi?ons, wch he desireth may be read and considered and put to the question by this Honoble Court. Whereas at a late Virginia Court there was tendered a Proiect by a former Co?ittee appointed and an imperfect Draft of another proiect by mr Wrote as touchinge the Salary and disposinge of Virginia and Spanish Tobacco wch two beinge compared by the Companie then assembled that of the Co?ittee was allowed by erec?on of hands &amp; so it stands confirmed. But forasmuch as it is conceaued that neither of those Proiect? can be in all point? fittinge for those of the Su?er Ilands Plantation wch stands vpon mayne Different Termes from that in Virginia It is humbly desired that, y Premises (so farr as concernes this Plantation) may be better considered and howe to be carried in the medium of a more equall waye before it be too sodainely con- cluded in this Court. That an indifferent Co?ittee may be nominated and appointed by this Court consistinge of such as are deepest engaged in the Supplyinge their shares and in the good? shortly to be returned thence. And forasmuch as this worke is of great importance aswell for his Ma benifitt as for the Aduenturers and Planters good if well performed so if otherwise to the verie great hurt of both. The Co?ittees are aduisedly to consider of the Sumer Ilands proporcon of Salary for Agency, and to agree with those Agent? of such explana?ons Coue- nant? and assurance to be drawne and indented aswell on the Aduenturers as on the Agent? part to be performed as shalbe thought necessarie for the bet- ter accomplishinge of the Contract wth his Maty and for securing the Aduen- turers and Planters in sundrie needfull point?, and also to consider perticulerly of the Agent? already nominated, and of the excep?ons to be taken §made§ against some of them. And that none of those already appointed for Salary in y Virginia nor their Brethren may be of this Comittee nor to haue voice in Court when this is put to the question they beinge of a second party wch must conferr with this Comittee. ffinally this Co?ittee shall nominate none of themselues to be Agent? or ffactors for Sallary howsoeuer they may be thought fittinge to be Agent? at large with- out Salary, as beinge such as will haue the greater care of vent and good suc- cesse in yt wherein themselues haue the greatest share &amp; interest. ffebr. 22th 1622. By me Robt Iohnson Ald [193] Wch beinge read it was by diuers aunsweared that such generallities did not any waye direct them in the perticularities nowe in question As for the matters desired to be referred to Co?ittees they were already vnder a select Co?ittee, then wch a more sufficient could not be chosen and these and many other point? had nowe err this bin well setled had it not bin for the interruption that had bin by these late courses in defaminge and disgracinge the Officers; wch were such and so many as Sr Edwin Sandys againe protested, that he would not for any reward whatsoeuer any longer endure them, wherefore he besought them to make choise of some other in his place, to the intent that for the want of that officer the buissines did not stand at a staye. The Lo: Cauendish moued that seeinge Sr Edwin Sandys would by noe meanes any longer hold the place of Director they would nowe propose some other fitt man for that office. Wherevpon some nomi- nated Sr Nath: Rich but he excused himselfe aswell for his owne insufficiencies as also that he should be often absent out of Towne: In wch reguard he would not vndertake it for 10000li ? Añu: but said if he were fitted for the buissines he should be willinge to doe it Gratis. Next some proposed Sr Thomas Wroth but he said he was not fitt for it. Some also nominated mr Edward Iohnson but he excused himselfe as no waye able for such a place. Sr Natha: Rich desired to be satisfied howe the Planter shalbe dealt wthall about his Tobacco in case he stand? in need of present money: Touchinge wch he said he would nowe make a Proposition to this Court vizt That he would vndertake together with his frend? within a short time to procure a Stocke of 14: or 15000li to take of the whole quantitie of Tobacco that should come home wch would be benificiall both to the Kinge and the Planter. In the end after a verie longe debate and dispute the Court seeminge ill satisfied that so many diuersions were made and that against the Salaries wch were nowe in question, there were brought not better Argument?, earnestly called vpon his lp: to put the matter to the question. Wherevpon his lp: put it to the question whither they would estab- lish all thing? accordingly as they were formerly ordered as well con- cerninge the Offices as Sallaries, wch beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? noe one dissentinge ordered and agreed that the Offices and Salaries should stand accordingly as they were formerly sett downe. [194] It beinge also put to the question whither they would accept of Sr Edwin Sandys resigna?on of the Office of Director or not: It was by a generall erec?on of hand? denied and on the Contrary he was gen- erally verie earnestly entreated not to thinke of leavinge the place vpon any discouragement whatsoeuer: they professinge that without his assistance they should much doubt of the well managinge of so difficult a buissines. The Virginia Court beinge ended the Lord Cauendish tooke againe the Chaire, and propoundinge the matter of the Proclamation wch the Lo: Treasuror desired to be forborne for some Moneths it was passed by erec?on of hand? in the Selfe same Termes together with the whole body ?of the? Contract as the Virginia Companie had passed it. As for the matter of Sallaries and Conveyance of land? it being almost eleauen of the Clocke it was moued that this Court might referr those point? to be disputed and debated of on Monday next with full authority to conclude them: Wch being put to the question it was generally agreed and ordered that these two buissinesses should that day be first handled and ordered before any other.</field>

The Quarter Court held the 5° of this present Moneth was read, wch beinge donn the Ea: of Southampton desired that if any man could take any exception at the entringe of the said Court he would doe it but no man takinge any exception thereat, his lp: after a good pause and dilibera?on beinge desired by diuers put it to the question whither they conceaued that Court to be rightly sett downe accordinge to the true effect and meaninge of what then passed, It was by a generall erec?on of hand? approued to be rightly sett downe no one dissentinge. Mr Caswell said the men?oninge1 1 The letters "inge" written over the letters "ed." of passinge certaine shares in the end of the Court nowe read did bringe to his remembrance a thinge wch diuers good members of the Companiehad with much solicitous- nes &amp; care and oftentimes thought and treated of, that is concerninge the manner of admittinge men to the freedome of this Companie wch seemed to them to be donn with more speed and lesse care and con- sidera?on then were requisite in a buissines of so high importance as the Planta?ons are wch as it is well know[n]e haue many and sore enimies diuers of wch (?haps to the intent they may do the more harme) seeke to obtaine the freedome of the Companie; and that as admissions nowe passe (vizt) vpon the first proposinge could not be avoyded nor hindred. Wherefore for the preventinge of so great inconveniences as the com- inge in of such ?sons would breed to the Companie, his mo?on was that it should be ordered and made a lawe that no enimy or open hinderer of the Plantations or vnworthie should be admitted into this Society, and for the better keepinge of them out he propounded that it might be ordered that if exceptions should be taken against any ?son that should be propounded, either as an enimy or euill willer to the Planta?ons or otherwise not worthie of this Society that the admission of such ?sons should not be imediately graunted at the same Court but respited to the pleasure of the Quarter Court next followinge. [196] The Ea: of Southampton said he had not heretofore heard of the Proposition of mr Caswell but vpon the first veiwe it seemed to him verie good and reasonable that there should be good care and order held in the admission of men to the Company of Virginia and the Su?er Iland?, diuers others likewise of the Companie co?ended mr Caswell? mo?on, and that the rather because that whereas in all other Companies men take an oath to be true and faithfull to the Companie in these Companies there is no such thinge: Wherefore it were fitt that since that time ?tye and? obliga?on is here wantinge, that there should be so much the more care and considera?on had in admittinge of men. But against this it was obiected that it was contrarie to the lawes of the Companie, wch said that admission shall not be denied where it is due: And it was further alledged that the Land in Virginia beinge held in free Soccage it could not by the lawes of the Realme be for- bidden, but a man might sell and put ouer his land to whome he pleased, and therefore the Companie could not deny to admitt any man. To the first it was answeared that the lawes of the Virginia Com- panie, did not speake one waye or other concerninge that matter, but that that clause was in the Sumer Iland? Lawes wch yet could not be so farr strained as that therefore any enimy or vnworthie ?son should be admitted. ffor the word? are ?where it is? apparantly due But certainely it is iustly questionable whither an enimy or vnworthie person should be admitted But for the second obiec?on the Ea: of Southampton said that he did not vnderstand ?the Proposition? to be ment concerninge the passinge of Right and possession of land? but onely concerninge the giuinge of vote and settinge in Court? wch a man might be debarred of, although he had not onely right but possession of land? in either of the Companies as was euident by the example of mr Wrote who although he was vtterly disabled from cominge to the Court? yet his land? and ffreehold? in both the Plantations were not taken from him: Wherefore although the Companie might not deny or debarr any man from sellinge his land to whome he pleased, yet they might refuse to accept of an vnworthie ?son as to haue voice amongst them: And this mr Christofer Brooke said was not ?not? onely ?not? con- trary but agreeable to the Lawes, for in diuers cases of right there was sued out notwithstandinge a writt of Ad quod Damnum before the thinge desired could be effected, And this respite of Admittance desired, was in effect no other then as a writt Ad quod Damnum wch beinge returned and cleared the Admittance would of it selfe ensue. [197] Sr Edwin Sandys also alledged the daylie practise of the Companie who refuse to admitt of any passage of land? from him that is indebted to the Companie wch is to be vnderstood from hauinge voice in Court? onely for it is not questionable, but that though a man be indebted to the Companie, he may passe his land? to any other, and that he that shall buy it shall haue as good right and title as the first had, but yet by the lawes of the Companie he cannot haue voice in the Court? vntill the debt be satisfied to the Companie, wherefore if in this case the Companie deny admission much more may they do it vpon such other waightie exceptions as were propounded. But it was further obiected that if vpon exception taken against a ?son propounded the Admission should be delayed and the matter referred to the Quarter Court, it would be in the power of any mali- cious man to affront and disgrace whome he pleased, and either he must sett downe with the repulse or el? put himselfe vpon a Tryall and censure of a multitude, whereby although he should in the end be iustified, yet he might incurr much disreputa?on and in the meane while haue his good name tossed vp and downe in mens mouthes: Wherefore they were of opinion that that course would be full of Scandall: as for clearinge the Companie of vnworthie Members; it was in the Companies power vpon iust reasons to expell them and cast them out. But the Ea: of Southampton aunsweared that it was both easier and safer to prevent the admittinge them, then beinge admitted to cast them out, and for the former part of the exception that they should gaine much more credditt by beinge so honobly cleared then they could suffer disreputa?on by beinge maliciously excepted against, and that consideringe the great shame and infamy that he that should mali- ciously call anothers worke in question should vndergoe men would be wary howe they hazarded their owne fame and good reputa?on in callinge others in question, wherefore this danger would hardly light vpon any that deserued it not. In the end after much dispute it was resolued that there should be a Co?ittee appointed to consider against the next Quarter Court of some fittinge lawe to be made concerninge the admittinge men in an orderly and warie manner and perticulerly ?for? the preuentinge of admit- tinge of vnworthie Members ??sons? wch Comittee accordinge to the forme prescribed in the lawes are to bringe their labor to the Counsell, and the Counsell to the Præparatiue Court, and so to the Quarter Court: This beinge put to the question was by a generall erec?on of hand? noe one dissentinge ordered: And for Comittees to prepare the buissines [198] was named Sr Robt Killigrue. mr Christo: Brooke. Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Wither. Sr Iohn Dauers. mr Berblocke. Collo: 1 1 Blank space in the manuscript. Ogle. mr Caswell or any 4: who were desired to meete as soone as conveniently they could treate thereabout, In the meane while till the matter might by a lawe be fully and ?fectly established, it beinge put to the question was by erec?on of hand? ordered, that no admission should be graunted at the same Court where it was propounded but referred to the next Quarter Court after; when when if no exception at all were taken or but such as should be friuoulous the admission should be confirmed but if any iust or weightie exception were taken against the ?son propounded, then the Admission should be deferred vntill the Quarter Court next followinge. Vpon the naminge of the former Comittee some nominated a gentle- man who had spoken against the mayne Proposition that was co[mtilde;]it- ted: Wherevpon the Lord Cauendish said that he hauinge spoken against the matter it selfe, might not be of the Co?ittee accordinge to the order in Parliament, where none that speake against the body of a Bill may be of that Court ?Comittee? to wch the considera?on thereof is referred, in reguard that he that is wholly against a thinge that would destroye it, and therefore could not be adiudged a fitt instrument for the rectifyinge of it: This course the Court held verie fitt to be kept hence forward, and beinge informed by Sr Edwin Sandys and mr Deputy that the handlinge of thing? by Co?ittees was not so well and orderly regulated as were fitt: The Court by erec?on of hand? ordered that the former Co?ittee should likewise take that pointe into their considera?ons, and thinke of some fittinge orders for nominatinge and meetinge of Co?ittees and for direc?ons howe they should proceed in buissinesses referred vnto them, and in this pointe the Co?ittee were desired, likewise to bringe their resolu?ons to the Councell Cr that a lawe might be made thereof. Sr Iohn Dauers propounded that whereas Sr Iohn Treuor the ffather desires to passe two of his Shares of land to Sr Iohn Treuor his Sonn, he not beinge indebted notice might be nowe taken thereof that his admission might be graunted at the next Court if no excep?on were taken. Mr Mellinge likewise propounded the passinge of two Shares to mr Boothby and that his admission might be also graunted at the next Court, if no exception were taken. Mr Gideon de Lawne propounded also the passinge of two Shares vnto his Sonn, and desired his admittance at the next Court. [199] Mr Binge and mr Woodall moued that they might haue a Coppie of that Petition wch without a name was exhibited and read in ye Quarter Court against them: It was answeared that since the Court did then refuse to enter farther into the examina?on of the matter obiected against them, because their was no name to the Peti?on that there- fore they need not trouble themselues to make further answeare therevnto, but they pressinge much to haue a Coppie giuen them of it, wch the Secretary acknowledged to be in his hand? it was moued, because the Court seemed of different opinions, that the decidinge thereof, that the decidinge thereof should be deferred till the publique buissinesses (wch were exceedinge waightie and important) should be handled, it beinge directly ordered by the lawe, that publi? buissi- nesses should haue precedency before all priuate. Molasco the Polander likewise earnestly besought that his peti?on might be read alledginge that he had attended aboue a Quarter of a yeare, and the Ea: of Southampton said that if his case were as he were informed he had suffered much wronge. Mr Deputy said that he was not altogether ignorant of the matter but knewe that there was so fowle oppression that had bin vsed to the poore man, and likewise vpon diuers others in the like cases as he was afraide, both the Companies and Plantations did to the waight of their owne sins suffer God? punishment for these former offences: Where- fore he thought it most necessarie to endeauor the rightinge of him, but that was to be donn accordinge to the forme prescribed by the Quarter Court: In this Court it could not be donne his case beinge verie longe and somewhat intricate: Wherevpon the Ea: of South- ampton willed mr Deputy with all convenient speed that might be to call the Comittee to whome that matter was referred that so the Court might doe him iustice: Wch mr Deputy promised. These thing? beinge thus donne the Ea: of Southampton said that the Director and Co?ittees had yesterday mett and treated about diuers point? concerninge the managinge and orderinge of the buissines him- selfe, the Lo: Cauendish and some other of the extraordinary Co?ittee beinge present wth them from two of the Clocke till almost Eight at night: And although the time was but short yet they had so well digested and contriued matters as himselfe and others rested much contented in the good forme that was propounded by the Director and the Co?ittees, for the safe orderly and faire cariage of those seuerall perticulers wch seemed most to affect them that had opposed the car- riage of the buissines in that forme, and by those men wch the Com- panies had concluded and chosen, wherevpon he willed mr Deputy to make report from pointe to point of what was by the Director and Co?ittees propounded. [200] But before mr ?Deputy? beguñ the Lo: Cauendish tooke the Chaire and acquaintinge the Su?er Iland? Companie that he had purposely caused a Su?er Iland? Court to be this day warned to the intent that they might likewise vnderstand and consider of those waightie point? that did equally concerne them with ye Virginia Companie wherefore he desired them likewise with all serious care to obserue and consider of the thing? that should be propounded and reported that they might afterward either confirme or amend them. Wherevpon mr Deputy desired of both the Companies dilligent and carefull atten?on because the point? were waightie and full of diffi- culties and further besought them freely to make what Obieccons they could in euery perticuler for soe either they should be satisfied or the thing? amended. ffirst therefore he said, that the Co?ittees considera?on did beginn at those ?ticulers, where the Contract ended, wch howe farr it went the the 6: Article expressed vizt That not onely the sole Importa?on but the sole sale was to be managed by ye Companies that is (as there is explayned) by such Officers as the Companies should choose and depute: This he said he did thinke necessarie to promise for the answearinge of those doubt? and exceptions wch he had heard by many both publiquely and priuately made (vizt) that they should be debarred of the possessions of their owne good?, that they must trust the sale of them to others Cr ffor this condi?on did arise imediately and was inherent in the very Contract it selfe, so that whosoeuer would enjoy the liberty or benifitt of bringinge in Tobacco hither must without dispute resolue to submitt himselfe therevnto, and therefore he desired that noe man would call those thing? in question but for the safe and secure custodie both of the good? themselues and also of the money after they should come into the Officers hand? and for the faire just and equall orderinge and disposinge and sellinge of the Comodity and that to the best proffitt and aduantage both of the Companies and his Matie the Director and Co?ittees had propounded these courses fol- lowinge to be held, wch he would in the selfe same order relate as they were by them considered of. ffirst therefore to beginn with the arriuall of the good? here they con- ceaued fitt that some Officers men of trust and that should take an oath should i?ediately be sent abourd the Shipps to take care that no Tobacco should be stolne out of the Shipps but all might be duely brought into ye Companies hand?. Secondly that the Maisters of Shipps and such others as should be thought requisite should vpon their oathes be examined and charged to deliuer a true and faithfull Invoice of all the Tobacco brought home in their Shipps. [201] Thirdly that besid? the Husband there should be at the least two of the Co?ittees appointed for the takinge vp of the good? out of the Shipps into the Custome howse who should with the Husband take exact notice of the waight of euery mans good? and howe it was agree- able to the invoices, and howe it was condi?oned to the intent that if by the Marriners or others there had bin any fraude and imbeasel- linge in the quantitie or by their neglect or default the good? were spoiled, there might be restitu?on made respectiuely vnto the Owners. ffourthly for the discharginge of the Custome ffreight Cr the Director Treasuror and Co?ittees should take order, without troublinge the priuate Aduenturers; to laye downe the moneys wch should be due, wch was conceaued would be generally a great benifitt and ease vnto the Aduenturers and Planters, and they might safely vndertake it, in reguard they had the whole goods in a pawne to make themselues full satisfac?on. ffiftly after the good? were cleared from the Custome howse, the Co?ittees together with the husband should take care, for the Safe conveyance and suer keepinge of the Tobacco in the Warehowses and Storehowses belonginge to the Companie, for the accomplishment whereof these courses were propounded. ffirst that it should be the care and charge of the Husbaund assisted with two of the Comittees at least to receaue in the good?, and to keepe a Booke plainely expressinge the quantitie waight and mark? of each mans parcell of Tobacco and in what Warehowse it is put: Wch beinge donn, the said Book? of the Husband should be presented to the Director, and the rest of the Officers who should take order that the Bookeeper should out of the said Book? frame an orderly and plaine Account, wherein should be expressed what quantity of Tobacco belong? to euery man and where it lyes. And to the intent that men may rest secure that their good? should not be purloyned nor imbeaselled by any meanes, it was conceaued fitt, that for euery roome or Warehowse there should be three seuerall lock? and keyes whereof the Director or Deputy should haue one, the Husband another, and the Third should be entrusted to some of the Comittees So that it should not be in the power of the Husband to goe ?in? but with the knowledge and consent of the Director Deputy and Co?ittees: And when he did goe it should not be but in the pres- ence and Companie of two of the Co?ittees at least, and that neither Curinge Sortinge Shewinge nor Sellinge should be at any time by fewer then two of the Co?ittees at least together with the Husband: And although this course would cost the Co?ittees both much time and labor yet it was thought requisite to be donn for the full securinge of mens mind?, for in reguard that the Co?oditie doth of it[s] owne nature much wast and diminish by longe lyinge if the meanes of imbeazellinge were not in some extraordinary manner preuented and debarred suspitious mind? or euill affected would take occasion (as sometimes heretofore hath bin seen) to impute the losse wch came by dryinge to the falshood of them vnder whose custody it was. [202] But this course as it would take away all meanes of doeinge wronge, so it would take away all scruples and feares out of mens mind?. This pointe ?being? related thus by mr Deputy diuers of the Com- panie spake in approba?on of the course prescribed, but no man mak- inge any obiec?on against it, onely diuers required that if it were possible the Warehowses and Storehowses might be all in the Com- panies howse or at least as neare as possible could be, and mr Roberts desired that the Virginia and Su?er Iland? Tobacco should be kept in seuerall roomes; To wch Answeare was made, it was so vnderstood because there were seuerall Account? to be kept of them. And that not onely the Tobaccoes of the two Planta?ons were to be kept assunder but the seuerall sorts of either Planta?on were likewise to be kept in seuerall Roomes: It was also de?aunded by some howe the Husband should doe when occasion should require that the Tobacco should be shewed in seuerall warehowses, to wch it was aunsweared that he should haue vnder him an inferior Warehowse Keeper, and if there were occasion to be in many Warehowses at once he might depute others in his place who should be paide for their paines, but without two Co?ittees no man should take ?medle? any good?. In the end the Court desired1 1 Written over "desiringe it." his 1p: put it to the question whither this course propounded by the Co?ittees did satisfie the Companie in the point of safe keepinge their good?, and whither they would rest satisfied with this Security and so order, that this Course propounded should be held, It was by a generall erec?on of hand? agreed (onely one dissentinge) that that course was good and safe, and should there- fore accordingly ?be? held and obserued. It beinge past fiue of the Clocke the Ea: of Sout?ton ?pounded the continuance of the Court, so longe after 6: of the Clocke till buissi nesses might be dispatched wch by erec?on of hand? was confirmed. The Lo: Cauendish also takinge the Chaire propounded the continu- ance of the Su?er Iland? Court so longe after 6: of the Clocke as there should be occasion. The good? beinge thus agreed to be sufficiently safe, the next pointe mr Deputy said that came into considera?on was the Securinge of the moneyes that should come into the Treasurors hand? that the Com- panie might thereby rest satisfied, that they should not suffer da?age neither by losse of the moneyes itselfe nor ?of? the Treasurors imployinge it to other vses. [203] And first they considered of that course wch was intimated by some both publiquely and priuately (vizt) the takinge of great Bond? and Suerties for the Treasurors makinge good whatsoeuer moneyes should come to his hand?. But consideringe that the Stocke was twoe great for almost any man to finde Suerties able to aunsweare such a So?e and that in farr greater Stock? of other Companies that was not required; they did not conceaue it fitt to de?aund that kinde of Security of the Treasuror, espeacially consideringe the smale fee that so great paines and charge he was to vndertake: for although there was 400li allotted vnto the present officer vnder the name of Treas- uror, yet it was not onely for the Seruice he should performe in that office, but in reguard of the place of Deputy wch he was also to exe- cute, wch if it had bin alone would in their iudgement? haue deserued 300li Wherefore they did not thinke it reasonable to de?aund such condi?ons as ?happs were impossible certainely very difficult to be ?formed; and so much the rather because the Kinge hauinge interest in the buissines men would be wonderfully Shye of any waye entringe into Bond in such cases. Wherefore they thought it better both for the present and for here- after to turne their thought? to the setlinge of such a course and forme as might preuent that §no§ da?age could happen, rather then howe it should be repaired after the losse came, by ?wch? the waye of Bonds and Suertishipps only implyed, and did not alwaies proue soe effec- tuall as it seemed to carrie shewe, by reason that many casualties might happen and many courses might be taken whereby the Security would be frustrated: Wherefore after mature delibera?on they fell vpon this course followinge. ffirst that there should be a safe and stronge rome chosen in the Com- panies howse for the Keepinge of the moneyes that shalbe receaued and stronge Iron Chest? prouided to put the money in: and that both the Chest? and rome should be vnder three lock? and keys, whereof one should be in the Keepinge of the Treasuror of the Virginia Com- panie, one other in the keepinge of the Gouernor of the Sumer Iland? Company and the Third the Treasuror for this Contract should haue, So that the Treasuror should not goe into the Treasury wthout the knowledge and consent of the two aforesaid Gouernors nor otherwise then with them or at least some ?sons of worth and sufficiency deputed by them: ffor in reguard that it cannot be that such noble personages should haue leasure so often as need might require to be personally present, it was therefore thought fitt that the Treasuror of Virginia might leaue his key with some one of the Counsell and the Gouernor of the Su?er Iland? with some of the Assistant?, [204] So that by this meanes it was conceaued that the money after it was brought into the Treasury would be safer and better secured then by any Bond? or Suertishipps whatsoeuer. As for the bringinge of money in and that the Treasuror should not be at any ?one? time possessed of any great So?e, it was thought fitt that once euery weeke the Director or Comittees or some of them together with the aforesaid Gouernors or their Substitut? should take Account of the Treasuror what moneys had bin that weeke receaued and should cause the same to be imediately carried into the Treas- ury vnder the Custodie afore prescribed. And in case the payment? should come in, in great abundance; the same course might be held twice or oftner in the same weeke So that by this meanes the Treasuror should neuer be possessed at any ?one? time of any greater So?e then himselfe should be adiudged sufficient wittnesse Security for. And further to the intent that the Treasuror should not be able by any art or cuñinge to detayne to his owne priuate vse any moneyes that he should receaue, it was thought fitt that besid? his Cash booke (wch vpon de?aund he should alwayes bringe out to the aforesaid Offi- cers) there should be kept a booke in a plaine and orderly manner, expressinge what good? are sold for ready money and what vpon time to whome and when it falls §out§ due; Wch booke shall lye open to the veiwe and pervsall not onely of the Officers, but of any Brother of the Companie, by wch meanes it is conceaued that not onely all fraude in the Treasuror wilbe prevented; But also many other good effect? will followe for thereby the Comittees (to whome the sale of the good? is referred) shalbe sure to haue good informa?on by the recourse of them that wilbe desirous to see this booke of the habilities and sufficiencie of those with whome they deale. This pointe beinge thus reported by mr Deputy there was a generall approba?on of the course many co?endinge it but not any one obiect- inge against it: Wherevpon his lp: was desired to put it to the ques- tion wch his lp: did in this manner. Whither they did iudged their wayes moneyes would be sufficiently secured by this course without further security of Bond or Suertiship from the Treasuror, and whither they would agree and order that this course should be held in this point it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (not one dissentinge) iudge that by this meanes the moneyes would be sufficiently secured, and it was ordered that this course should be held concerninge the Treasury. [205] These thing? established concerninge the safe custody of good? and money mr Deputy said thus, the next considera?on of the Director and Comittees was concerninge the disposinge and sellinge of the good? wch that it might be donn in a iust and equall manner both for the Kinge and the Owners, since not onely the Tobacco of seuerall men would be of different goodnes and worth, euen the selfe same ?cell would ?happs containe Tobacco of two or three ?verie? different sort? for price and worth it was therefore before all other thing? absolutely necessarie to haue euery mans parcell veiwed and iudged of what condi?on and goodnes it were and if it were not all alike that the different sort? should be distinguished and seuered and this differ- ence they conceaued might be reduced to three kind? best, middle, and worst by wch course euery man should haue the true proceed of his owne good?, and the full and iust price accordinge to the condi?on and worth of his Tobacco without either receauinge or doeinge wronge by hauinge his Tobacco mingled wth others beinge of the same goodnes and worth as his is. As for the true and faithfull distinguishinge of these seuerall sort?, it was conceaued it should be donne by men skillfull in the nature of Tobacco who should be chosen by the Companie in their Court? and haue an oath administred vnto them to do it without any manner of partiality either of fauor or hatred, and that they should thus sort the Tobacco in the presence of the Husband and at least two of the Co?- ittees who should keepe an exact Account howe euery mans ?cell is by these Sorters iudged and esteemed, and takinge care that it beinge once distinguished, it may not againe be confounded shall carrie vp to the Bookee? the Account of each mans ?cell, who should ?shall? accordingly enter downe in his booke howe much of each sorte belong? to euery man wch he shall shewe and giue a note of to any owner that desires it. This beinge thus reported by mr Deputy some ?made? mo?on that when the sortinge was to be performed, there should be in the howse where the Court? are kept a bill sett vp declaringe from daye to day whose Tobacco should be sorted to the intent that the owners might themselues be present to see right donn them, But this was generally adiudged inconvenient as a thinge that would not hinder, but cause the doeinge of much wronge and breed much contention if the owners might be by. for euery man would striue and ?swade that his good? might be made of the best sort: But on the Contrary the Court gen- erally thought fitt that the Husband and Comittees should haue it giuen them in charg that not only any owner should not be present when his good? were to [206] be sorted but that they should further endeauor as much as they possibly could to conceale from the Sorters all such mark? and tokens whereby they might any way guesse to whome the Tobacco wch they sorted belonged, for so certainely not knowinge whose good? they were, they would deale indifferently and faithfully accordinge to their iudgment? and Skill. It was by some also moued that the Sorters might not be Buyers, because it was said, they might therby sett out good Peñyworthes for themselues to the preiudice of the Stocke, but vpon debate it was not conceaued that any such inconvenience could followe if good care were vsed; But on the other side it would be an ill leadinge example to debarr any man from beinge a Buyer that would bidd a good price and make good payment. Mr Roberts moued that there might be Three sorters to euery ?cell to the intent that if two were of different iudgement the matter might be ended by the Third: This mo?on was well liked, both for the reason he alledged, and also because it was thought harder to corrupt three then a lesse number wherefore although it would breed more charge, yet it was thought good to followe that order. In the end there beinge no more obiec?on made, and the Court gen- erally likinge well of this course, my Lo: at the request of the Court put it to the question, whither they did approue of this course wch mr Deputy had reported wth mr Roberts Addition; It was by a gen- erall erec?on of hand? assented vnto and ordered that that course should be held for the sortinge of Tobacco. This donn mr Deputy said that after these prepara?ons they were nowe come to the Disposinge and Sellinge of the Tobacco; In wch pointe the proffitt of the Aduenturers did maynely consist, wch they founde to be an Ac?on contayninge many part? and branches all requiringe exact care and considera?on, but diuers of them could not be well iudged of nor resolued on vntill the thinge it selfe came to execu?on when accordingly delibera?on was to be taken: Wherefore the Director and Co?ittees had nowe onely proposed certaine generall head? tendinge to the equality of ?and? iustice and to the mayntayn- inge of the Co?odity at a good price. [207] ffirst therefore they conceaued that after menns ?mens? Tobacco should be so sorted as before was agreed on, and the Bookeeper entred euery mans parcell aright vizt what quantitie of each sort was due vnto him that then mens ?ticuler ?cell? should not be any longer kept assunder but mingled and put together respectiuely one with another, that is the best with the best, the worst with the worst, and so the middle sorte with that of the same kinde: Which beinge donn the sale should be made out of the lumpe, and so euery man should from time to time as moneyes came in receaue their diui- dent propor?onably accordinge to their seuerall part? of that wch was sold and this they held to be the onely equall and faire course whereby euery man should alike perticipate of proffitt and losse: As for the sellinge of mens ?cell? seuerall it was a course so full of iust and obuious exceptions as need not be repeated. This mr Deputy said was the first and most generall waye wch was propounded and if it were by all men followed would certainely best keepe vp and improue the Co?odity when it could be fetched, but at one head. But he said that in reguard diuers members of this Companie had declared themselues not onely willinge but desirous to take out their owne Stock? and part? pretendinge that what price soeuer the Com- panie shall sett, they yet shall be able for to sell at a higher rate, in reguard the Companie sellinge in grosse, must alwayes leaue a suffi- cient gaine whereby the Retaylor may liue: ffor the contentment therefore and satisfac?on of such men, they conceaued it fitt to giue liberty vnto them (defrayinge all charges and leauinge for euery Third pound of Tobacco ready money for his Mats vse) they might take out their Stock?: And way beinge thus giuen, he said that the doubt and feare, that some men had made of suffringe wronge by the Sorters, either corruption or negligence in not rightly iudginge and esteeminge of their Tobacco, was resolued and taken away, for if the Sorters should, estimate any mans ?cell to be of a worse sort then indeed it was and that his that was of the best sort should be made of the second, and the second the worst, the owner might by their error make great aduantage to himselfe whilest he should haue the Kings Third at a cheaper rate then indeed it was worth, So that ?mittinge this libertie the Sorters could not preiudice any man by vndervaluing his Comodity, if they ouervalued it, it was to the losse of the generall lyvinge and Bulke, but greatly to the aduantage of the perticuler owner, who should thereby receaue a better price then indeed truely his good? were worth: These mr Deputy said were the [208] two Generall head? wch the Comittees had propounded many ?ticu- larities fallinge vnder them they had likewise considered of, But because they were grounded vpon some obiec?ons &amp; exceptions that might be taken against these courses, he therefore not doubtinge, but that the same scruples and argument? would be nowe made in Court, would reserue them to their propper places by wch meanes they would be best vnderstood: And herevpon the Ea: of Southampton and the Lord Cauendish desired the Companies that they would freely ques- tion de?aund and obiect that by explayninge thing? might be fully vnderstood and by debatinge and disputinge the best course might be found and accordingly followed. Herevpon some said, that if the Tobacco shall at first be high rated, and accordingly men leaue the Kings part, if they could not sell it after the same rate or if the Companie should after lett fall the price they that tooke it out, should be much damnified. To wch answeare was made, that this liberty was giuen onely vpon that ground that men by takinge out should make more and not lesse: Wherefore if a man would take out his Tobacco at a certaine price without beinge sure to make more if he afterward sold it for lesse it was his owne fault, and therefore must endure the punishment, wch they that doubt may do well to leaue it in Stocke with the rest whereby they might be sure not to loose. It was further obiected, that this lycense beinge giuen, many men would take out, and vpon desire to make present money sell the Co?odity at a farr lesse rate then they tooke it out, whereby they would bringe downe the price of all that remained in Stocke or at least cause that none of it should be sold till all theires were vented, and the example of the East Indy Companie was put, where men take out peper and other Co?odities at a high rate and presently to haue ready money sell them much vnder. Mr Deputy made answeare that these obiec?ons had bin made in the Comittee, and likewise further wch he thought first was to be resolued, that it might seeme against the Contract whereby it is agreed with his Matie that there should be a sole sale of the Tobacco, wch seemes not to agree with the diuidinge and partinge it into so many hand? as this course would cause: But for that he said it was vnderstood that the sole sale was onely so farr intended as to bringe the Co?odity to a reasonable high price, wch was conceaued to be sufficiently donne by taking a good price for euery Third pound, whereby men were tyed not [209] to sell vnder, except they would doe it to their losse wch is not to be supposed in men that liue by tradinge, and the aduantage of gaine between the buyinge and sellinge As for the Instance of the East Indy Companie it was verie different from this, first men did not indeed sell so much vnderfoote, as it seemed for the prices wch they tooke the Co?odities out at was not the price of ready money but the price of a verie longe time, whereby although they sold a great deale vnder that; yet they made neare vpon as good reckoninge as if they ridd out the time besid? he said, that men there tooke out their Stock? without any further charge, but here was a great deale of ready money to be laid out downe whereby men would be wary what they did and would not ouer fondly pull losse vpon themselues with the disbursinge of so much money as might be otherwise well imployed certainely the able Aduenturer and the rich Planter would ?not? doe it, but would rather haue patience to expect a good Account with others, then with so many Inconveniences to inda?age himselfe As for the thriftles ?and? royetous ?son he would be hardly able to finde out so much money howsoeuer there would not be so many of these as should,1 1 Written over "would" by Collingwood. much hurt the Stocke for their disorder could not be generall, but onely reach to some ?ticuler places and that for a verie short while. ffurther mr Hackett said that he did not see that any preuen?on could be made against such spend thrift? and bankruptly minded men for so they must in the end proue that would take out at verie high rat? and sell at verie lowe to gett ready money: ffor if their Stock? might not be deliuered them as their owne; yet they could not be debarred from buyinge whereby the same inconveniences would followe: In the end after much dispute about this point the argument? ?on? both sid? beinge found to be verie waightie, the further considera?on of them was referred vntill the next Court. ffor the releife of the Planters vpon wch ground so many had vnder- taken to turne all topsie turuy mr Deputie said that the Director and Co?ittees hauinge seriously considered of the matter did not finde that there was like to be either that great number of them as if neces- sity should force them to sell vnder foote ?there should followe any great [endamagement] vnto the Stocke? for he said that the greatest part of the Planters that vse to send home good? were very able men, and for those poore Planters that do come home it had bin obserued that the most of them goeinge vp and downe with their Tobacco amongst their frend?, did by one meanes or other sell it at farr greater rat? then the Companie were likely to sell theirs. [210] As for the rest of the poore Planters whose either ill husbandry necessity or want of iudgement might cause them to sell much vnder the worth, the number would be but fewe and the quantity of their good? but smale, so that the mayne Stocke would not thereby be much preiudiced although they tooke their part? out and sold them neuer so much vnder: But for the remedying thereof, and much more for the releiuinge of those ?sons: the Director and Co?ittees propounded that after all diligences vsed by the Planter himselfe for the best sale of his Tobacco (wherein §to§ their vttermost they would giue all good helpe) if he would not come to some reasonable price, the ?cell? should be brought into the Court and sold by the candle whereby it was not doubted but that he should come very neare to the iust price, espea- cially consideringe that such kinde of mens good? could be but smale quantities wch would be euery mans money. These Proposi?ons were liked and the further considera?on of them referred likewise to the next Court. Sr Edwin Sandys acquainted the Court that the Lo Cauendish, him- selfe, and some others, hauinge had conference wth my Lord Treas- uror his lp: told them that direc?on should be giuen to mr Atturney for the present drawinge vp of the Patent and that his Letters also should be forthwth dispatched to all the pts ?Port?? in reguard the Proclamation could not as yet come forth.</field>

The Court held on Wedensday the 12: of ffebruary was nowe read: wch donn after a good pause, the Ea: of Southampton said, that as he was heretofore slowe in puttinge thing? to the question, so nowe he would be much slower, because it had bin reported to the Lord Treas- uror that the Companie were ouerawed and durst not speake, wch whither it were true or no themselues could Wittnesse, wch report the whole Court vtterly condemned to be false and scandalous, professinge that they enioyed as much freedome and liberty of speach as they could desire The said Court of the Twelueth of ffebruary was by a generall erec?on of hand? no one dissentinge confirmed to be truely sett downe. Sr Edwin Sandys at the request of the Ea: of Southampton did nowe make report what passed in the morninge before the Lo: Treasuror, where he said were present the Gouernors and Deputies of both Com- panies Also Sr Io: Dãuers, himselfe and some others, And on the other part the Ea: of Warwicke Sr Nath: Rich, mr Alderm: Iohnson [213] mr Wrote, mr Binge, mr Caninge and mr Woodall with some others, as also Sr Io: Wolstenholme and other the Customers that seemed to assist them, all of them directly impugninge the Contract as conceauinge it to be verie preiudiciall vnto the Plantations: much speach passed wch the Lord Treasuror heard with a great deale of patience interruptinge no man: In the end one of the Customers made a Proposition to his lp: that seeinge there was so much difference and frac?on between the Companies by reason of the Contract, it might no longer hold, but the Companies be bound to bringe in all their Tobacco and pay the i2d Custome vpon the pound wch would be more contentfull to the Planters and more benificiall to the Kinge: for it was supposed within two or three yeares, there might ?will? be brought in yearely fower hundred Thousand waight from both the Plantations wch at 12d ? pound came to — 20000li and in case a fourth part of this was abated and so the payment brought to 8d it would amount to 20000 li mark? wch with 6000li that would be giuen for bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco would make vp the former So?e of — 20000li.1 1 This is the first of a series of estimates. Many rough notes and memoranda by members of the opposition are mentioned in List of Records, between Nos. 396 and 424, Vol. 1, pages 163 to 166, Wherevnto answeare was then made, that this 12d ?li was as hard a Bargaine for the Planter as the other: wch was shewed first by instance of the smale proffitt that Sr George Yeardly made of his Tobacco: Sec- ondly by the smale proceed of the Magazine nowe returned wch of 7000li Stocke had scarce produced 4000li of their principall money after 2 2 A blank space in the manuscript. yeares forbearance: Hee added also a Third instance out of his owne experience of his Sumer Iland? Tobacco: In the sale whereof he could hardly cleare — 6d ? pound notwithstandinge he then paid neither Custome nor imposi?on for it. At length the Opposers presented to the Lord Treasuror certaine Articles, contayninge partly Propositions, partly exceptions, where- vnto his lp: required aunsweare In all wch passage Sr Edwin Sandys said, he was sorry to heare so much by speach and that it was soe confidently averred espeacially by mr Wrote and mr Binge, that the Companies in the carriage of the buissines were ouerawed by the Ea: of Southampton with a kinde of threatninge, that vnlesse the Contract went on the Planta?ons would be taken awaye from them. Sr Edwin Sandys further added that the Lord Treasuror intimated that seinge the Companies haue receaued so much grace and fauor of the Kinge by Lottaries and other meanes for aduancement of the Plantation, he held it most vnfitt they should nowe carrie their Com- odities any other where then into his Mats Dominions: and therefore concluded that whither Contract or no Contract, all must be brought into this Kingdome to paye custome whereby his Mats Revenue might be aduanced: Wch Proposition ye Opposers did well like of, and said that they euer more desired that all might be brought in and mr Wrote said that the Colony in Virginia had sent a Peti?on to be exhibited to his Matie to that purpose, but the same was neuer presented to the Kinge but concealed and suppressed by mr Deputy. [214] Touchinge wch the Ea: of Southampton said it appeares as well by the verie peti?on it selfe as also by a Letter from the Colony at that time vnto the Counsell here, that the Collony did meane nothinge lesse then was pretended and that the scope of their peti?on was onely to obtaine liberty to bringe in their Tobacco into England whereof they were at that time vtterly debarred. The Ea: of Southampton also signified vnto the Court that the Lord Treasuror at their cominge awaye beinge asked whither they should proceed in this buissines or no said, they might proceed and goe on on notwithstandinge these differences and opposi?ons. Accordingly his lp: said they would nowe proceed, and therevpon began to propound to the considera?on of the Companie, that seeinge this Contract did equally concerne both Companies, they were first to consider howe to aduance the price of the Tobacco that should come from both the Planta?ons, to the most proffitt and aduantage aswell of the Aduenturers as Planters of both the Companies: wch the Co?- ittee hauinge duely considered of, conceaued it could no waye be donn vnlesse both Companies did ioyne and agree together about settinge the price of the Tobacco. Wch pointe beinge taken into considera?on some were of opinion, it were most fitt, that each Companie should sett the price of their owne Tobacco, Wherevnto aunsweare was made that by that course there might fall out a verie great inequality in settinge the price thereof: for in case two Shipps should come together, the one from Virginia the other from the Su?er Iland?, if the one Companie should sett theirs at 5s—and the other at 4s—by this meanes the one would sell of all of their Tobacco (beinge lower priced) before the other should be able to put of any at all. Wherevpon after mature delibera?on and debate, it was at length put to the question, whither vpon the cominge home of any Tobacco from Virginia or the Su?er Iland?, the Companie did not thinke it fitt, that after the Co?ittees haue considered of a price both Companies be assembled together (and not one alone) to sett the price thereof This by a generall erec?on of hand? was agreed and ordered no one dissentinge. It was likewise propounded, that in case the Companies cannot agree in settinge the price and that they both differ also from the price sett by the Co?ittees, as for example, if one sett at 6s1 1 Written over "d." ? pound and the other 5s that in such case the medium wch is 5s 6d be sett: This propo- si?on was well approued, and beinge put to the question, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? agreed and ordered that in such cases the medi? should be taken. [215] It was further propounded that in case the one Companie agree with the Co?ittee in settinge the price and the other Companie shall thinke fitt to sett a higher price and withall shall offer to take it of at that higher price that then they may haue it, otherwise the price sett by the Co?ittees and the other Co?ittee Companie to stand This proposi?on was also well approued of and by erec?on of hand? generally agreed and ordered accordingly. Lastly it was propounded that in reguard the Contract doth equally concerne both Companies, and that there is a necessity of vnitinge them together whereby they may vnanimously agree together in their proceeding? touchinge the Contract, that no Act or buissines be donn touchinge the same but by the consent of both Companies assembled together: So that what shalbe ordered in one Court may be againe propounded and ordered in the other: Wch Proposition was also well approued of and ordered accordingly</field>

Mr Deputy obseruinge diuers Strangers to be in the Court not free of the Companie, as he conceaued, desired that they would depart the Court: But some said that they were Planters that come lately from the Su?er Iland?, and therefore thought fitt (there beinge also a Su?er Iland? Court warned) that they might likewise be present: But it was aunsweared that there was the last yeare a lawe made, whereby that was forbidden: And it was likewise testified that for these two last yeares the Companie had thought fitt to deny leaue to such Plant- ers as were not ffreeholders to sett in Court? and that therevpon they had bin often times excluded wherevpon they were nowe entreated to depart the Court. After wch the Lord Cauendish said that vpon Satturday last there was a message sent from the Lord? of his Mats Priuy Counsell to warne himselfe and such1 1 Written over the word "some." others as he would bring with him on the one side, and the Ea: of Warwicke and ?or? Sr Nath: Rich and such others as they would bringe wth them on the other ?tie for the Su?er Iland? Companie: And for the Virginia Companie Sr Edwin Sandys and mr ffarrars and such as they would bringe with them on the one part: And on the other part Sr Tho: Smith and mr Alderman Iohn- son and such others as they would bringe with them to attend the Lord? on Tuisday morninge, concerninge the setlinge of the buissines of Tobacco: Wch his lp: said they did accordingly, beinge accompanied with the ?my? Lo: St Iohn, the Lo Padgett Sr Edward Sackuill Sr Iohn Brooke Sr Io: Dauers Sr Robert Killigrewe and diuers others of the Companie where there mett likewise diuers perticuler men of the Companie, vpon whose complaint? against the Contract, the Lord Treasuror signified this meetinge was appointed: Wherevpon the Lo: Cauendish said he made Protesta?on that the Contract hauinge bin often and most orderly concluded in diuers Quarter Courts, himselfe and the rest of the Companie attendinge him did not nowe come to giue those Members of the Companie that nowe opposed it any satis- fac?on, for beinge not onely as the lesser part involued in the generall agreement, but most of them hauinge actually giuen their consent? vnto the concludinge of the Contract it were to the preiudice of all good gouerment to treat further with them there about: But if their ?ps vpon any sinister informa?on giuen them had conceaued any doubt?, himselfe and the rest were ready to giue an Account to their llps of all their proceeding? and such as they were assured should in euery perticuler satisfie them. Wherevpon their ?pps requiringe some of the Complaynant? to make knowne their greiuances their mr Binge stepped forth and made a longe invectiue against the Contract and the manner vsed [217] in passinge it; wherein he said men were ouerawed by threatninge word?, that if they yealded not thereto they should do worse that they must quitt the Plantations, That the Ea: of Southampton findinge an vnwillingnes in the Companies to yeald to so hard a bargaine, sett him downe in his chaire, pullinge his hatt ouer his eyes and foldinge his Armes acrosse and leninge backeward in his Chaire, as if all were lost, wch kinde of behauior and former word?, frighted the Companie to yeald vnto this Bargaine it beinge concealed from them (wch nowe their ?ps signified) that this Contract was offred by the Lord Treasuror in his Mats name as from his espea- ciall grace to the aduancement of the Plantations: And further mr Binge said that the Ea: of Southampton did not onely saye that he would be mr Wrotes Accuser, and that whilest he was in the Com- panie there would be no peace nor quiet but that he did make it his suite vnto the Companie to put him out: And these thing? amongst many other his lp: said mr Binge did not onely deliuer but Act; and that in such a manner as was distastfull to the Lord? of the Counsell: Wherevpon mr Binge was by their ?ps rebuked for his behauior and word?; and his Lp: said he could not forbeare to desire iustice of the Bourd against him for hauinge so wronged and abased the Ea of Southampton beinge a Peere of the Realme and a Member of that Bourd not only nowe in their llps presence but also other where hau- inge said as by two sufficient Wittnesses would be there proued that if he had bin as mr Wrote when my Lo: of Southampton by order of the Counsell for Virginia suspended him from that ?e? Counsell he would haue told him His lp: should not suspend him from the Coun- sell of Virginia beinge a suspended Lord himselfe from the Counsell Table ?of State?: Wch Speech mr Binge denied desiringe that point might be deferred till the returne of my Lo: of Warwick and mr Wrote who were nowe with the Kinge. His lp: said that the Lord? of the Counsell seemed much offended with mr Binge; and said they would ?not? let his it passe but would consider of it by it selfe. But for the mayne buissines out of mr Bing? speach, the Lord Treas- uror propounded three point? to be insisted on; ffirst whither the Companie were ouerawed, Secondly whither this Contract were for the good of the Plantation, And lastly that if this present Contract were not good for the Plantations howe it might be made good. ffor the first pointe of ouerawinge his lp: said that diuers other affirmed as mr Binge had donne, wherevpon by himselfe and Sr Edw: Sackuill they were much pressed to deliuer the word? ?wherewth they were? (as they said) threatned and affrighted: Wherevpon mr Gibbs said, they were told if they did not yeald to this bargaine they must do worse they must quitt the Planta?ons: [218] Wherevnto the Lo Cauendish said there was by himselfe and others made Aunsweare that if those word? were spoken it was declared and explayned what the meaninge of them was: That if the Companies did not accept of this Bargaine of sole Importa?on (nowe it was offered them) it would be vndertaken by others wch would be much worse for them as they had found by experience and ?happs their Tobacco thereby would be ?so? brought downe as they should not be able to liue, and so the Planta?ons might be quitted but as for intendinge thereby his Mats displeasure to the Companies (if they refused this Bargaine) or that otherwise the Planta?ons would be taken from them as these Oppugners would nowe pretend it was answeared that it was most false the Contract hauinge bin from the verie begininge to the end propounded to the Companies as a thinge offered by his Matie meerely out of his grace and fauor to the Planta?ons and by the Lord Treasuror out of his espeaciall loue and respect to the Plantations: In wch reguard his lp refused other greater offers for matter of proffitt, and in this manner was the proposing of the Contract expressed and sett downe in the Court book? as was there presented to be shewen: The debatinge and clearinge of this pointe his lp: said, held all the forenoone. In the afternoone the second point propounded by the Lord Treasuror was considered and debated vizt howe good or evill this Contract was for the Plantations: Wherevpon Sr Natha: Rich instanced his case that hauinge ?sent? 120li of Co?odities this yeare he should loose it all except a verie litle if this Contract proceeded accordinge to the Account that he made: But his lp: said that it was by Sr Edwin Sandys and others answeared, that this Contract was not concluded by the Companies nor by them proposed simply as a good bargaine but onely comparatiuely as a better then that estate they were for- merly in, wch by many instances was proued not onely of ?ticuler mens cases, but principally of the great Magazine wherein men had lost after six week? ?yeares ? time neare halfe of their Capitall?, and that in Sr Natha: Riches Account there was a mayne error in the verie ground in ratinge Tobacco in ye Country at ije vjd a pound; At wch price the greatest part of Tobacco came home these last three or fower yeares had not bin sold. And this pointe his lp: said after longe debate and dispute was so well cleared as he supposed the Lord? of the Counsell were fully satisfied with the reasons giuen on the Companies part vizt That by this Con- tract the Companies were not sett in worse case, then they were for- merly: In the end his lp: said they were willed to goe out and after a good while himselfe and Sr Edwin Sandys [219] and the Deputy of the Virginia Companie were called in againe, where they were by the Lord President told, that it twas not their lps pleasure to speake nowe of the Contract but of a Post-act vizt the sendinge of some Shipps from the Plantations to Holland wch his lp: made aunsweare was none of the Companies Act but of perticuler Aduenturers to whome the Shipps and good? belonged; their ?ps seemed much offended thereat, and ?willed? his lp: to signifie and declare it to the Companies that it was the pleasure and co?aund of that Bourd that the Tobacco and all other Comodities belonginge to those Plantations should be brought directly home for England. Mr Deputy said that the Lord Præsident told them further concern- inge the Contract (speakinge to the Lord Cauendish) that his lp and the rest had giuen a good Account vnto the Bourd, both of the rea- sons they had in concludinge this Contract as also of the faire pro- ceedinge and carriage in the passinge of it, whereof they would giue his Matie aduertisement, and doubted not but that the Companies should haue either the Contract confirmed vnto them accordingely as themselues had agreed and ordered or el? some other bargaine asmuch to their content. His lp: hauinge breifely deliuered ?declared? the report, mr Gibbs conceauing that the Lord Cauendish had said, that he was one of them that had said at Counsell Table that he was ouerawed, desired that if the Secretary had so sett it downe it might be altered and amended for he said he denied at Counsell Table that he was ouer- awed but had indeed alledged those former word? wch he left to the iudgement of the Bourd what sense they may carry. Mr Binge said that the ouerawinge that he spake of, he did not meane it of metus potentiæ but of metus reverentiæ. Mr Deputy said that he conceaued there had three thing? of speciall of obseruance and note passed at Counsell Table that daye, two point? whereof were matter of great ioye to himselfe, and he doubted not were likewise of singuler comfort to the Companie. ffirst a most humble ?honorable? testimony giuen by the Lord Treasuror of the good proceeding? and carriage of the buissines of the Plantations these fower last yeares, so as his lp: said they had thereby thriuen and prospered beyound beleife and almost miraculously: The Lord Cauendish said that the Lord Treasuror added further that in the former yeares when Alderman Iohnson was deputy and the buissines was in other mens hand? it was carried leaudly So that if they should be called to an Account for it their estat? could not aunsweare it. Secondly the good satisfac?on that their ?ps had receaued and rested possessed with concerninge the Companies proceeding? in this buissi- nes of the Contract. [220] But the third pointe ?he said? required matter of exact considera?on vizt their ?ps co?aund to bringe in all their Tobacco and other good? to wch Proposition of their ?ps it hauinge bin made vnto the Com- panies about a yeare and halfe a goe the Companies had then pre- sented vnto their ?ps diuers reasons declaringe the impossibility that was for the Companies to ?forme this as also the extreame preiudice that would thereby arise vnto the Plantations wch was so great, as by a second remonstrance to their ?ps the Court? then assembled, made humble protesta?on that out of their duety to God and his Mae they could not giue their consent thereto: And therevpon he said he con- ceaued that their ?ps had rested satisfied and contented, but nowe they seemed resolutely to require it, wch he doubted was through the offers and mo?ons of some Brothers of the Companie who out of opposi?on to this Contract did propose this newe waye, and it was by some of them informed the Lord Treasuror that the whole Companie §Colony§ of Virginia had made peti?on purposely to that effect offringe to bringe in all their Tobacco and that this peti?on had bin by himselfe and ?some? others concealed: wch howe True it was would appeare by the peti?on it selfe and the Companies §Counsells§ letter, wch mr Deputy produced and were read beinge as followeth.1 1 This letter is cited in List of Records, No. 229, Vol. I, page 146, an.

Sr Edwin Sandys said that obseruinge the Collonies last conclusion of their peti?on, he sawe verie good ground for the vsinge of those word? of quittinge the Plantation if they were vsed (wch yet he said he remembred not) for except the Companies did themselues accept of the Contract for sole Importa?on it was likely to haue bin giuen vnto others who made offer of so exceedinge and large a Revenue to his Matie as could not possibly be by them raised but with exceedinge much preiudice to the Plantation wch they had brought to those termes as this peti?on nowe declared wch was to a direct resolu?on of quittinge the Plantation, so that it might be verie iustly said that if the Com- panies did not themselues vndertake the sole Importa?on it would be worse for them and in this sense and noe otherwise could that worde be vsed without a stronge and most absurd contradiction, for that they should be entended to signifie or intimated the feare of the Kings displeasure or indigna?on or the Lord Treasurors [222] or any others intent to take awaye the Plantations as is nowe made to be suspected and conceaued could not possibly stand in any reason and sense with those continuall prefaces and introduc?ons wch were ?propounded and? vsed at all times in this buissines (vizt) that it was offered on his Mats part out of his meere grace and royall inten?on for the good of the Planta?on and from the Lord Treasuror out of an espeaciall loue and fauor vnto the Plantation as beinge himselfe one of the most auncient Aduenturors and Counsellors and therefore exceedingly affectinge the prosperity and encrease of the Plantations so as it might stand with the maintenance of his Mats Revenues although with some abatement of that wch was offered by others who would not ?happs haue that tender respect vnto the Plantations as his lp: desired: wch manner of proposinge the buissines beinge fresh in their memories and so sett downe in their Court book? he said he did appeale vnto the iudgement of the Court? then present whither there could be drawne any such sense from the word? of doeinge worse and quittinge the Plantations as is nowe pretended was conceaued: As for the worde (necessitated) wch was at Counsell Table alledged to haue bin spoken by a principall Member of this Companie in priuate, he said it was to be vnderstood, not of necessity of force ?but of necessity of Reason? whereby men were willinge for the bettering of their former estate and for the preventinge of a worse, wch they might iustly feare to accept of that condi?on wch in it selfe was hard but in comparison of their former estate was easier: Mr Gibbs said he neuer heard of this distinction before, and mervayled it was not vsed before the Lord? and said that he was assured, there were 40 in the Court who vnderstood them otherwise: But it was aunsweared that these aunsweares and interpreta?ons were made at Counsell Table by many and mr Deputy moued that the clear- inge of this pointe might be presently put vnto the iudgement of the Court, sayinge that he was verie confident that there would be found either not any at all or exceedinge fewe of that opinion. Wch mo?on diuers of the Court approued but some fewe opposed say- inge that since the Court seemed generally to vnderstand them other- wise, and the Lord? of the Counsell had declared themselues satisfied in that point, that therefore it was needles: It was also desired by them that it might be forborne for the maytayning of peace: But it was replied by the Lord Cauendish that this was the waye to make true peace by sellinge and determininge the [223] point? in contro- versie: wherefore after a longe debate and opposi?on made herevnto by some fewe, the Court often and earnestly called vpon mr Deputy to put it to the question: Wherevpon he said that he would first put to the question whither it should be put to the question or noe wch the Court well liked, and it was by a generall erec?on of hand? ordered and agreed that the matter should be put to the question: But it beinge past fiue of the Clocke it was desired that the continuance of the Court might be so longe vntill buissinesses were disspatched wch was accordingly ordered: The continuance likewise of the Su?er Iland? Court vpon the Lord Cauendishes Proposition was ordered by a generall erec?on of hand?. Wch beinge donne and diuers of those that had opposed it, departinge out of the Court the matter was againe considered of and it was desired, and it was desired for the fuller vnderstandinge and clearing of the matter, that the question might be sett downe in writinge wch was accordingly donn, in two Questions wch were as followeth. ffirst it was put to the question whither in passinge the Contract between his Matie and the two Companies for Virginia and the Su?er Ilands for the sole Importa?on of Tobacco there had bin euer any ouerawinge of any man by my Lo: of Southampton or my Lo Cauen- dish or any other by any ?sonall speach or carriage or by vsinge any word? of power either as in his Maties name or the Lord T?ers or the Lord? of the Counsell: It was by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) denied that there had euer bin any manner of ouerawinge of any man in passinge the said Contract. Secondly it was put to the question whither the matter hath not bin carried fairely, and by strength only of reason appearinge to the Court? and not otherwise: It was by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) vnanimously confessed and approued to haue bin fairely carried and by strength of reason onely and not otherwise. Sr Edwin Sandys hauinge desired (as he had donñ often before) that they might proceed to the mayne buissines touchinge the Importa?on of Tobacco deliuered that after longe arguinge at the Counsell bourd by the Opposite ?ty against the intended Contract, it pleased the Lord President with great grauity and wisedome to moue that seeinge they disliked so much of this Contract they would propose some other course for the managinge of the Importa?on and Sale of Tobacco whereby [224] the matter might be so setled as to giue more generall content still preseruinge a due reguard to those twoe mayne end? namely the vpholdinge of his Mats proffitt together with the benifitt of the Plantations. Wherevpon mr Edward? proposed to the ?? that seeinge by their Letters Patent? they were to paye onely 5 ? Cent? to the Kinge for custome without any other taxes or imposi?ons wch 5 ? Cent? would not amount to aboue 3d ?li for Tobacco notwithstandinge in reguard of his Mats fauor that the Companies and Planta?ons might haue the sole Importa?on of Tobacco they would double that 3d and giue vnto his Matie 6d for euery pound of Tobacco wch he hoped his Matie would be pleased graceously to accept seinge the Comodity could beare no greater burden with the welfare of the Plantation: This Proposition beinge passed ouer as beinge of noe proffitt to his Matie. Sr Iohn Wolstenholme stood forth and (as well appeared out of pre- meditated thought?) made a larger Proposition consistinge of 3 part? wch beinge seconded againe and againe by another gentleman one of the Customers: he conceaued it to proceed from their agreed resolu- ?on And therefore as beinge a Proposition grounded vpon consul- ta?on and aduice and maturely concocted by men of good vnder- standinge, he would with fauor of the Court examine it in the seuerall part? and so deliuer his opinion of the vertue and goodnes of it. Hee said then that Sr Iohn Wolstenholms Proposi?on consisted of three branches, the first, that touchinge the Importa?on of Tobacco there should be a generall freedome so that euery man without restraint might bringe in what he pleased, and after it was brought in, might be mr of his owne good?. wch he thought would be a thinge of generall content to all men. The second branch was, that the Companies and Planta?ons should paye here onely 12d the pound of Tobacco for custome and Imposi?on and be discharged of these extraordinary burdens of Officers Sallaries and other Charges. [225] The third branch, that the Companies and Collonies should be co?- aunded to bringe all their Tobacco and other Co?odities into this Realme beinge a matter verie fittinge for diuers waightie considera- ?ons. This beinge the Proposition and these the branches of it, he said he would offer to their considera?on diuers reasons against them, thereby to drawe from other men, what contrariwise might be said in their defence and maintenance, that so by conflict of reasons on both sid?, the truth might better appeare and consequently the soundnes or vnsoundnes of the Proposition. Hee said that to the first branch there offered themselues (as he thought to euery mans vnderstandinge,) three mayne exceptions; The first that by this vnrestrained liberty of bringinge in Tobacco from all places aswell from Spayne as the two Planta?ons there would growe here such a generall glutt of that Comoditie as would bringe downe the price to so lowe a propor?on as would discourage the Aduenturers and vndoe the poore Planters, the same beinge contrarie to the maine intent of the Contract wch was to raise the price of the Co?odity to the generall benifitt of the Planta?ons Secondly it beinge averred before their ?ps that the meaner sort of Tobacco in Spaine may be bought for the value of 6d or 12d at the most, and on the other side it beinge alledged by the ?ty opposite to the Contract that the Tobacco of the Plantations could not possiblie be affoorded at lesse then 2s 6d the pound, it did necessarily followe that the Spanish Tobacco would be much chea? then the Tobacco of the Plantations and consequently would be first vented (to the extreame detriment if not beggeringe of all the poore Planters especially consideringe the nature of the Co?- odity wch could not be longe kept without wast and perishinge.) A Third reason he said might be drawne from the wisedome of the late Assembly of Parliament where it beinge found by euident proufe and the Spanish Marchaunt? confession that the Importa?on of Spanish Tobacco into this Realme had hindred the Importacon of Spanish money what by the price of the Tobacco itselfe and what by the vnder- sellinge thereof of our English Co?odityes for the sudden buyinge vp of the Spanish Tobacco to the value of 100000li sterlinge by the yeare, wch hauinge so [226] continued for 10: or 12 yeares then last past, was conceaued to be one principall cause of the scarcity of money in this Realme, and therevpon the lower howse framed and passed a Bill for the banishinge of Spanish Tobacco, and for the sole Importa?on of that Co?odity from the two Planta?ons And whereas also the nowe Lord Treasuror out of his like care and respect to the Welfare of this Realme had restrained the Contractors in this yeare last past from bringinge in of aboue 60000 waight of Spanish Tobacco, this Proposition settinge all at liberty and grauntinge a generall freedome of bringinge in Tobacco from all places might well be to the aduan- tage of some other Na?on, but certenly was preiudiciall and that in a high degree both to the wealth of this Kingdome and to the sub- sistinge of the Plantations. Touchinge the second branch of Sr Iohn Wolstenhomes Proposition as it was made at the Counsell bourd (for in other places he had made it otherwise) that the Companies and Colonies should paye to the vse of his Matie or the ffarmors of his Custome and Impost? 12d for euery pound of Tobacco imported, it seemed that it was much more then that Comodity could beare if the benifitt of the sole Importation were taken from them; ffor if it were true wch the Obiectors against the Con- tract avouched that the Tobacco in the Colonyes stood them in 2ds 6d the pound, there beinge added thereto this 12d, and 6d at the least more for freight and other publique charges of the Plantations it fol- lowed that vnlesse the Tobacco were sold one with another at 4s the pound, the Companies and Collonies should be loosers by it of their principall? whereas contrariwise there seemed no probable apparance, that in so great a glutt of Tobacco and the meaner sort of the Spanish Tobacco beinge so cheape and the Comodity beinge diuided into so many hundred? of hand?, that euer it would be sold at aboue 12d or 2s the pound at the vttmost and this he said was confirmed by the experience of sundrie later yeares, wherein our Tobacco one with another had not bin sold at aboue that propor?on: And although the Planters [227] could afford their Tobacco at 12d ? pound in the Plan- tations, yet it is cleare that this charge of Tweluepence and 6d more must need? cause that all they wch dealt in that Co?odity should liue in a continuall losse to their vtter consumption, a veiwe whereof might be taken he said in the late great Magazine wch beinge co?itted into the hand? of a wise and prouident Director, after 6; yeares con- tinuance by the fall of the price of this Co?odity had brought a Stocke of 7000li to lesse then 4000li to the great discouragement of all future Aduenturers. Nowe to the third branch of this Proposition that the Companies and Collonies should be co?aunded to bringe in all their Tobacco, as like- wise all other Comodities, ffirst into this Realme, from hence to be after vented by trade to other Na?ons, he said he would not enlarge much vpon it because he vnderstood that this Proposition had bin formerly made by the ?? aboue a yeare since in his absence and aun- sweared by the Court? in writinge and so exhibited to their ?ps yet this he would add that the Dealers in this Contract with the Lord Treasuror had at sundrie times acquainted his lp that the Tobacco of the Plantations beinge in point of interest of three seuerall natures the one part belonginge to the bodies of the Companies, another part to diuers Societies, as Southampton and Martins Hundred, a third part to ?ticuler Planters wch he thought was the greatest part; that for the Tobacco belonginge to the Bodies of the Companies, it was in the Companies power to bringe it alwayes in, But for the rest the Companies had no power to enforce them, they beinge as free by his Mats originall Graunt as the rest of his Subiect? inhabitinge in this Realme. Howbeit they thought that as by the rigor of the former Contractor the Planters had bin driuen to seeke forraigne part? for their mar- chandize, so nowe by the good vsage wch they might receaue vpon this graunt of sole Importa?on and sole sellinge they might be reduced to come hither againe as beinge their best markett butt whereas it hath bin alledged by a verie honoble ?son, in waye of example that the Col- lonies of the Kinge of Spayne vp and downe the West Indies brought all that marchandize to Spayne and no other place he said that he thought that there might be some important difference, if the misin- forma?ons wch he had receaued from credible ?sons were true, the State of Spaine suffred noe other Comodities of the same kinde to be brought into that Kingdome wch was an exceedinge great benifitt to all his Indy Collonyes, wch fauor if it would please his Matie to vouchsafe to the two Plantations, he doubted not but they would gladly yeald [228] obedience to that co?aund and this he hoped was their ?ps intent out of their fauor to the Plantations: But nowe as the Proposition was made by Sr Iohn Wolstenholme that without any such benifitt of sole Importa?on, they should be constrained to bringe in all their Co?odities; he doubted that as it tended to the Customers priuate enrichment soe in short time it might redound to the ruine of the Planta?ons for the Colony in Virginia had and might haue many Comodities of smale price as Salt Pipestaues, ffish, Caueary and the like wch in other part? might be vendible at an indifferent price, but here not soe, the distance of place and great fraight con- sidered &amp; consequently they were to be exported againe out of this Kingdome, nowe consideringe that within fiue or six yeares at the most the Kinge is to haue custome of all marchandize in Virginia it selfe if those good? should paye a second Custome here and after- ward? a Third Custome in forraigne part? where they are vented, who can doubt but these three Customes together with freight and other charges would so feed on the Co?odity as to leaue smale sustenance for the Aduenturer and Planter But howesoeu9 it should please the Lord? to deliuer their co?aund whither simply with a grace annexed for the sole Importa?on as in the Spanish Dominions for his part he would alwayes be the Sonn of obedience and doubted not but the Companies would informe themselues accordinge: How- beit he thought it the part of well ordered duety both to yeald obedi- ence to the Superiors co?aund, yet in case of impossibility or publique mischiefe that might ensue, to give vp a true informa?on both of the one and other. These reasons beinge generally approued and confirmed by many in the Court mr Rider said he had somewhat to add to that wch was spoken by Sr Edwin Sandys vizt that the Plantations in the West Indies were founded by the Kinge of Spayne out of their owne Treas- ury and Revenues And the State of Spayne mainetayned the Garri- sons there, together with a great Nauy for their vse and defence, whereas or Planta?ons were were both setled and supported by the charge of priuate Aduenturers, saue that it was added by another they had helpe by his Mats grace of some Collec?on and Lot- teries wch had bin expended meerely vpon the publique: Where- vvpon the Court after mature debate and considera?on desired it might be signified to their ?ps that they should be willinge in obedi- ence [229] to their ?ps co?aund to ?giue order for? bring?ing? in all their Comodities from the said Plantation for this yeare as much as in them laye, but wheereas diuers Shipps haue bin sett out by pri- uate Brothers of the Companie and also some belonginge to Planters in Virginia it is not in the Companies power to compell or force therevnto: And further the Court desired that it might be humblie signified to their ?ps: that as they had formerly made remonstrance to their ?ps this causinge of all Comodities to be brought in, would be a meanes not onely much to ?their? preiudice but vtterly to ouer- throwe the Plantations for the reasons wch they had formerly pre- sented to their ?ps and some others nowe alledged wch the Court? desired might be drawne vp and againe presented to their ?ps. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that himselfe and the Auditors as much as his time would giue him leaue through so great and many interruptions as had of late hapned, had beguñ the auditinge of the old Magazine Account wch he founde somewhat more intricate and difficult then he expected but of that he would farther aduise them hereafter, nowe he said he was beinge entreated (by diuers of the Aduenturers) to propound to their considera?on what they would do concerninge the moneyes due vnto them nowe almost fower Monethes from mr Alderman Iohnson and mr Essington for Tobacco sold vnto them wherevpon they yet owed 800li as by the Account vnder mr Essingtons owne hand appeared. Alderman Iohnson said there was 500li lost by that bargaine that him- selfe did but firme the Bill for mr Essington that vpon the Account of the Magazine, there was owinge to him aboue 300li wch he would be allowed before the 800li should be paide. Mr Deputy replyed that mr Alderman was the principall in the Bill and was ?not? the Security, That it was true that by the Account mr Alderman was made Debitor Creditor for 3000li but he said that the Auditors conceaued the greatest part of it was to be deducted vizt neare vpon 100li laide out in Charge against Captaine Bargraue against wch the Companies had alwayes protested that they would not allowe anythinge: Besid? vpon the Susan Account there was due 100li for from Alderman Iohnson: And further whereas Alderman Iohnson brings good So?es ?paid for interest of moneys? they can- not finde by the Account but that there must be a great deale of abate- ment in reguard that they finde by the Account that he kept good Somes of money in his hand? [230] at the same time: In the end the Court desired mr Alderman to prouide his defences in these point? against the next Court: And whereas mr Deputy acquainted them that there was remayninge from diuers ?sons debts longe due vizt from mr Morris Abbott 38li—7s—0d from mr Nicho: Leat 43—0—0 from mr Wm Caninge 88—5—7 Mr Bull and mr Caswell are desired to entreat those gentleman to paye in their moneyes, or el? not to take it ill that the Companie shall by course of Lawe be enforced to seeke it.</field>

[231] The Court held the first of this present Moneth beinge read there was obserued an omission in the entry of my Lord Cauendishes report of part of my Lord Treasurors speach at Counsell Table touchinge mr Alderman Iohnson namely that after the Lord Treasuror had giuen a verie Honoble testimony before the Lord? of the good carriage of the buissines of the Plantation for these fower yeares last past, (whereby his lp: said it had thriuen and prospered beyound beleife and almost miraculously) The Lord T?er added further that in the former yeares when Alderm: Iohnson was Deputy and the buissines was in other hand? itwas carried leaudly, so that if they should be called to called to an account for it their estat? could not aunsweare it wch word? diuers could ?did? well remember they heard that my Lord Treasuror spake them at that time and earnestly desired they might not be omitted.1 1 The rough draft and original copy of this order are referred to in List of Records, Nos. 421 and 422, Vol. I, page 166, ante. There are a few changes in the order. Vpon this mr Caninge said, that if that o?ission were added, he praid it might likewise be remembred that Sr Edwin Sandys was an assist- ant to Sr Thomas Smith, ?in those tymes? and that nothinge was donne without him. Sr Edwin Sandys ?replyed? that true it was he was often times ioyned with Sr Thomas Smith by the appointment of the Court? in many waightie buissines concerninge the Plantation; wherein he gaue his faithfull aduise and Counsell: But said withall it was as true that comonly what was then donne in Terme times duringe his aboad in Towne was for the most part vndonn againe in the vacations when he was absent out of Towne. At length mr Deputy beinge earnestly called vpon by diuers put it to the question, whither they would haue that omission touchinge mr Alderman Iohnson added in his due place in the former Court It was by plurality of hand? ordered that that omission should be added accordingly as they were spoken by the Lord T?ar and reported by the Lord Cauendish. Mr Binge likewise took exception at the settinge downe of some word? in the said Court touchinge him; affirminge that he did not saye at Counsell Table that the Plantation should be taken from them, for these word? he said were spoken in another place. Wherevpon for that it was not certainely remembred whither they were spoken by mr Binge or noe at Counsell Table the Court caused [232] them to be strooke out. Mr Wolstenholme also tooke exception to the aforesaid Court sayinge that Sr Iohn Wolstenholmes Proposition at Counsell Table was not rightly related, for that he made it there with some abatement of the Custome. Sr Edwin Sandys answeared that Sr Iohn Wolstenholme made this Proposition in three seuerall places. ffirst in my Lo: Treasurors Chamber and secondly at a Virginia Court held in this place (speak- inge here indeed of reduceinge 20000li wch 400000 weight at 12d ? pound would rise to 20000 merk?) but at Counsell Table he made it other- wise and spake not there of any abatement wch he conceaued was donn out of good respect and caution: because it was not fitt for Sr Iohn Wolstenholme before the Lord? to make abatement of the Kings proffitt but rather to endeauor the aduancement thereof. But diuers present in Court that were then also present at Counsell Table affirmed that Sr Iohn Wolstenholme there deliuered the Propo- sition, as Sr Edwin Sandys had reported it, and as it was sett downe: And so the Court seeminge well satisfied, and no man makinge any further obiec?on mr Deputy was desired to put the said Court to the Question; (wch those former words beinge strooke out) was in all other point? confirmed to be truely sett downe by a generall erec?on of hand?. After this the Lord Cauendish acquainted the Court with an order he receaued from the Lord? of the Counsell concerninge the bringing in of all their good? and Co?odities ?the Copie wherof? doth here fol- lowe (vizt) At Whitehall the 4th of March i622 in the afternoone.

Whereas by an order of the Bourd dated the 24th of October i621 it was vpon diuers waightie and iust considera?ons vpon full hearinge of the Vndertakers of Virginia ordered that no Tobacco or other marchandize be transported out of any of the Plantations of Virginia into any forraigne [233] part? vntill the same should be first landed here in England, and his Mats Customes paid there- fore: Their ?ps hauinge bin informed that notwithstandinge the same order, there haue verie lately certaine Shipps laden with Tobacco both from Virginia and the Su?er Iland? bin conveyed into forraigne part? without euer landinge here: The Bourd hath thought fitt to renewe the said order, as well for Vir- ginia as the Su?er Iland?: and withall to enioyne the Gouernors Officers and all other perticuler Members of both those Companies who may any waye be enteressed therein, to giue order, as well to prevent the like fault hereafter as to redeeme that already co?itted by procuringe the said Shipps to returne hither, vpon those penalties that the refractories and Contemners of the authority of the Bourd may expect: And the Gouernors and Officers of the said Companies, are to take notice hereof and to publish it in their Court? respectiuely and to looke that it be executed accordingly ?Exr W: Beacher? Wch beinge read mr Deputy signified that this Proposition of bring- inge in all their Co?odities was made vnto the Virginia Company by their ?ps neare about 18 Moneths since Wherevpon the Companie made an Aunsweare contayninge diuers reasons both of the impossi- bility to performe it and also the great inconvenience wch would followe to the Planta?on in case they should be compelled to bringe all their Tobacco in hither: But their ?ps further pressinge them they made a second remonstrance to their ?ps wherein they made an humble protesta?on that out of their bounden duety to God and his Matie they might not agree therevnto, wherevpon hauinge not heard any thinge more since that time ?mr? Deputy said he conceaued their ?ps had rested satisfied wth the reasons then presented vnto them; That this should be nowe againe by so strict a comaund reviued, he could not coniecture whence it arose except it were from some of the late Opposers of the Contract diuers of whome (as is well knowne) did in my Lo Treasurors Chamber professe that their desire was all should be brought in, and it was there also by mr Wrote confidently affirmed that it was the desire of the Planters in Virginia to bringe in all, and that they had to that purpose peti?oned to the Kinge, but they said their peti?on was concealed and neuer deliuered. Sr Edwin Sandys said that this Proposition had heretofore bin often times debated in priuate with my Lord Treasuror vnto whome the Impossibility of bringinge in all was apparantly shewed in respect the Co?odities in Virginia had three seuerall sort? of Owners vizt first the Companie, Secondly ?ticuler Hundred? ?belonging to Aduenturers here? Thirdly priuate Planters there residinge, ouer wch two later sort? the Companie had noe [234] power ?at all? to restraine them by lawe, and diuers of them hauinge Shippes of their owne, it was not in the Companies power to prevent them to carry their good? whither they please. But yet it was signified vnto my Lord Treasuror, that such a moderate and faire course might be taken as to induce them all willingly to bringe in their Comodities, namely if his Matie would be so graceously pleased to affoord them the like priuiledges and fauor as the Kinge of Spayne doth to his Collonies in the West Indies (vizt) that what Co?odities the Plantations shalbe able to serue this Kingdome with may be prohibited from beinge brought in to ?from? forraigne part? and without such a qualifica?on he said his opinion was the bringinge in of all Co?odities was a Proposition extreamely preiudiciall to the Planta?ons. Wherevpon the Court entred into a serious considera?on of this Prop- osition, and hauinge caused the former Aunsweares to be distinctly read and hauinge alsoe waighed and considered of them well, and diuers other waightie reasons beinge newly alledged after longe and mature delibera?on, it was resolued by the Court to present an humble aunsweare to their ?ps declaringe the impossibilities and inconveniences that would acrewe vnto the Planta?ons by this Proposition: Where- vpon although it was by some propounded that it might be referred to the prepara?on of a Co?ittee, yet the Court thought it vnecessarie to loose time in so plaine a case, and therevpon Sr Edwin Sandys and mr Christofer Brooke were by the Court desired, takinge both the reasons that had bin formerly presented to their llps by the Companie together with those that were nowe newly alledged into their consid- era?on, to drawe vp a Breife Aunsweare, wch in reguard the matter was so well prepared and digested to their hand? was conceaued might be donn duringe the sittinge of the Court: Wherevpon they withdrewe themselues and the Court was continued by erec?on of hand? so longe as need should require. Mr Binge moued for a Coppie of the Peti?on that was put vp against him at the last Quarter Court for Virginia: wherevnto some replied the Court had made no entry thereof, in respect it had no name there- vnto: But mr Binge still earnestly pressing for a Coppie the Secre- tary was willed to fetch the originall [235] Wch beinge brought in was read and demaund made, whither any ?they? would acknowledge the said writinge to haue bin put in by him, but none tooke it vpon him- selfe in ?ticuler: but in generall the whole Court seemed to beare Wittnesse to the trueth thereof, and in ?ticular one honoble and noble person that had in the Quarter Court spake verie earnestly against it, nowe said, he did it out of loue to mr Binge esteeminge it so true that if the Court had entred into examina?on thereof, they could not haue donn lesse then was there required, and diuers others openly affirmed that at the Quarter Court when it was first exhibited, they conceaued it verie true and fitt for the Court to haue proceeded in it, but onely in reguard there wanted the Authors name that should haue bin sub- scribed therevnto, wherefore they then rather gaue waye to lett a good thinge passe and sleepe then to giue a President of such an incon- venience as might arise by takinge accusa?ons wthout knowledge of the Authors. Herevpon it was by diuers moued that since mr Binge had so much misconstrued and traduced the Companies proceeding? in this pointe, as to charge them with iniustice and wronge for reading of it, whereas he rather should haue acknowledged their modera?on and speaciall fauor to him in not proceedinge thereon, that therefore the ground of the Companies refusall might stand cleared: It was desired that it might be put to the question whither the Companie did not thinke the materiall part? of the said writinge to be true wch mo?on was generally well liked and so without any considera?on of his demeanor since that time, it beinge put to the question whither the Companies did conceaue that writinge at the time it was exhibited in the Quarter Court, to be in substance and in the materiall point? of it true, for those things alledged against mr Wrote Binge and mr Woodall it was by a generall erec?on of hand? onely three dissent- inge, adiudged that the writinge was in substance true at the time it was exhibited. Mr Binge likewise moued that he might haue a Coppie of that wch the Lord Cauendish had reported that he had spoken at the Counsell Table: Wherevpon mr Deputy put it to the Question and by a gen- erall erec?on of hand? it was ordered that the Secr? should giue him a Coppie. Sr Edwin Sandys and mr X?er Brooke brought in an Aunswr drawne vp accordinge to the head? giuen wch was as followeth. [236] The humble Aunsweare of the Companies for Virginia and the Su?er Ilands to the right Honoble the Lords and others of his Mats most Honoble Priuy Counsell touchinge their ?ps Proposi?on and Comaund for the Importinge of Tobacco and all other marchandize from the said Plantations into England. May it please yor Lops The Companies holdinge it their dueties to obserue yor Lps co?aund? will proceed accordingly to the best of their powers. Notwithstandinge in reguard of some Impossibilities on their part? to put the same in full and effectuall execu?on, and in reguard also of the great detri- ment wch in their vnderstanding? would redound thereby to the Plantations they hold it also their dueties humblie to offer to yor Lps graue considera?ons the perticulers ensuinge. ffirst they beseech yor Lps to consider that these Companies beinge not as Companies of Merchaunt? for the menaginge of Trade but for ye transporting and setlinge of people in those vnhabited Territories vnder good gouerment and consequently for the enlargement of his Mats Dominions, haue noe power to dispose of his Mats Subiect? planted in those part? either for their persons good? or possessions, otherwise then accordinge to his Mats Letters Patent? and the Lawes of this Realme of wch they and their posterities inhabitinge in those Plantations are by expresse word? foreuer made free and naturall Sub- iects: Of some of wch Letters Patent? the verie originalls, and of other some authenticall Coppies haue bin transmitted vnto the Plantations and are there remayninge with them: So that the power of the Companies cannot extend to the infringinge of any liberty or freedome graunted by his Matie to his Sub- iect? placed or to be placed in the said Plantations. Secondly yor llps may be pleased to be aduertised that the Companies by expresse word? in his Mats Letters Patents are equalled in their priuiledges and liberties i?unities to any other Companie or Corpora?on for trade or discouery and it is well knowne that both the Muscouy and sundrie other Companies haue alwaies enioyed the liberty of carryinge their Co?odities to the best market? at their pleasures and haue vsed the same accordingly. Thirdly these Companies haue graunted diuers Subpatent? with the same lib- erties and priuiledges as they themselues enioye whereby the Patentees haue bin induced to goe ouer in ?son to those Plantations (sundrie of them beinge of noble and worthie ffamilies) and to expend some of them great So?es and others their whole estat? in the said Planta?ons [237] And it is not nowe in the Companies power to revoake or restraine their former Graunts. And they conceaue that the bare attempt thereof would be a great dishart- ninge of all present and future Aduentures. Nowe touchinge the da?age and inconveniences wch would ensue from hence to the Plantations they humbly beseech yor llps to take also into yor fauour- able considera?on these other ?ticulers. Many Co?odities do nowe begin and are like to arise in Virginia wch by rea- son of the charge of fraight, by the greatnes of distance will not be vindible in England at any savinge price as namely ffish Caueary, Pipestaues, Quanti- ties of Sassafras Salt and the meaner sort of Tobacco wch in other forraigne part? may yeald some reasonable proffitt, but beinge brought hither will hardly discharge the Customes: ffor it is to be considered that after 5 or 6 yeares his Matie is to haue custome for all marchandize in Virginia it selfe, then to pay here a second custome and afterward? a Third in forraigne part? whither these Co?odities must of necessity be exported will proue insupportable and to the great hinderance and decaye of the Planta?ons. Yor ?ps may be pleased also to vnderstand that besid? that sundrie of the Inhabitants there haue Shipps of their owne, the Shipps wch carry Passengers thither from hence do trade with them also and barter their Comodities most of wch Shipps afterward? proceed on other voyages and returne not directly for England wch if they were forced so to doe they neither would transport thither Passengers nor barter Co?odities. They haue begun a Trade from Ireland to Virginia whereby the Collony is supplied from thence with Cattle and other necessaries at a much cheaper rate and they haue passed their Contract? to repay them in Tobacco wch if they shalbe compelled to bringe ?first? into England the Trade with Ireland is like to perish in the verie begiñinge to the exceedinge preiudice of the Colony whose want? we knowe not howe to Supplie but by these and the like meanes our Stock? beinge vtterly spent and exhausted. Lastly yor llps may be pleased to be aduertized that by his Mats Letters Patent? wee are expressly restrained from concludinge of any thinge touchinge the setlinge of Trade otherwise then in or §fower§ great Quarter Court? to be held in the fower termes. Neuertheles in the meane time wee shall doe our best endeauors for holdinge of the Trade so much as may be to this Realme wch wee suppose can by no other meanes be so well effected as by the continuance first of his Mats ?great? grace and next of yor llps accustomed fauor to the Planta?ons. Wch beinge deliberately read the Court did by a generall erec?on of hand? ratifie and well approue thereof and desired the Lo: Cauendish and ye Lo: Padgett and Sr Edw: Sackuill to present the same to their ?ps in the name of the Companies. [238] These Shares followinge beinge propounded at the last Court and no man nowe takinge exception were admitted vizt. Sr ?Mr? Henry Sandys who had 5 Shares assigned vnto him by his ffather Sr Edwin Sandys. ffrauncis Bickely and Robert Alden who had one share a peece assigned vnto them by Tho: Viner. There were nowe also propounded the passinge of these Shares fol- lowinge. One share to Richard Middleton by Iohn Budge. Two Shares by ?to? Richard Biggs of London Haberdasher by William Grosan.</field>

The Court held the seauenth of March was nowe read, whereat no man takinge exception after some pause, mr Deputy put it to the ques- tion, whither the Companie conceaued that Court in effect and sub- stance to be rightly sett downe: Wherevpon it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) approued to be rightly sett downe. [239] This donne the Lo Cauendish acquainted the Companie with what had passed the last Tuesday morninge before the ??. of the Counsell touchinge mr Binge who for his sundrie misdeamenors and insolent speeches vsed not onely concerninge the Ea: of Southampton a Mem- ber of that Bourd but also of a higher consequence was co?itted to the Marshalseas and before his deliuery from thence is to giue the said Ea: fittinge satisfac?on as may appeare by their llps order. This ended the Lord? havinge promised to fall into the buissines of the Contract it was growne so late as their ?ps deferred it till the Afternoone where the Companie beinge againe present, the Lord Treasuror thought fitt, because there were but a Thynne Counsell (as then) to deferr the hearinge till the next ffriday morninge, but his lp: said that hauinge moued the Lo: Treasuror and mr Chauncellor of the Exchequor that the Opp?osers?1 1 Written over "Oppugners." against the Contract might put their proposi?on in writinge as the Companie intended to sett downe theirs, the Lord T?er answeared, that that was not the ques- tion for the Kinge did not in this Contract respect his owne proffitt, as they ?somuch as he? did the good of the Plantations: And there- fore seeinge it had bin alledged that the bargaine concluded on was but comparatiuely good; his lp: wished if a better way could be found out for the good of the Companie and Colony, that might be thought vpon and propounded at the next meetinge. To wch end his lp: said he caused this Court to be called and warning thereof to be giuen to all those that opposed the Contract although he could see but fewe of them nowe present But his lp: said, that since the Lord? had so nobly made profession of their duety ?desire? and willingnes in fauor of the Plantations to yeald to an easier bargaine, he thought fitt nowe that the Court should enter into a present and serious considera?on howe that might be accomplished. Wherevpon it was moued that those that haue so maynely oppugned the Contract, would please to acquaint the Court (as were fitt) what newe Proposition they had to present that might be of greater ease and benifitt vnto the Companie and Colony to the end it might be nowe considered of and debated, and in fine brought to some resolu- ?on what should be fitt to moue to the Lord? (but there was no man although it were longe expected, that offered any newe Proposition) and diuers of the Companie, declared their opinions to be that the Court? should make most vse of this noble fauor of the Lord?, by seeking rather to make the Contract lighter in some point? then by attempting any newe waye, wch course the whole Court generally assented vnto. [240] Sr Edwin Sandys moued them to take the seuerall part? of the Con- tract into considera?on and to reexamine what goode or euill each mayne branch conteyned, and to confirme that wch shall appeare to be to the benifitt and aduantage of the Plantations and desire a levia- ?on in that wch shalbe hard or preiudiciall Wch manner and order the Court exceedingly approued and accordingly proceeded first therefore it was considered and argued whither the sole Importa?on of Tobacco vizt That none should be brought but from the Planta?ons (wch Sr Edwin Sandys said was the founda?on of the contract) together with the inhibitinge the plantinge thereof in England and Ireland were absolutely necessarie: This proposi?on of sole Importa?on was after much debate and examina?on found to be so absolutely necessarie for the Companies as thereon depended the verie life and subsistence of the Planta?ons. Wherevpon it beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) agreed vnto and adiudged that the sole Importa?on was absolutely necessarie for the mayntenance of the Planta?ons and that no preiudice nor da?age could be greater to the Planta?ons, then to be depriued thereof. Secondly Sr Edwin Sandys propounded to the considera?on of the Court the Couenant of beinge tyed to bringe in a certaine quantity of Spanish Tobacco wch was by diuers said to be the hardest part and article in the whole Contract diuers estimatinge it to be to the preiu- dice of at least 40000li waight ? Ann? to the Plantations in reguard that whatsoeuer the Spanish Tobacco did arise to was taken awaye from the Plantations: Wherevpon it was generally desired that his Matie and the Lord? might be peti?oned, that the Companies might be freed from this condi?on, yet withall diuers of the Court professed, that since by the Contract it was to be but for two yeares, and without the Contract it would perhapps be for euer, that therefore it might withall be declared vnto the Lord? that if so be their llps should not thinke fitt for some higher reasons then their Court? could conceaue, to graunt this desire, the Companies did not desire to breake the Con- tract although it were ioyned with this burden: Wherevpon Sr Edwin Sandys made the Proposition that followeth, That whereas by the Contract they are tyed by Couenant to bringe in—80000—waight of Spanish Tobacco in the first two or three yeares, whither they did not thinke fitt [241] it be signified to the Lord? of the Counsell that they do not vary from that agreement: But if it shall please their Lps to mediate with his Matie so farr in fauor of the Planta?ons and §as§ that the Contract may be discharged of that couenant either in whole or in part, that they ?shall? take it for an extraordinary fauor, and be a very great encouragement both to Aduenturers and Planters: This Proposition beinge likewise well approued was put to the question and by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) desired the Lord? might be earnestly moued to that effect as was proposed. Thirdly Sr Edwin Sandys proposed to the considera?on of the Com- panie, what retribu?on they would giue to the Kinge in case his Matie should graunt vnto them the benifitt of sole Importa?on and discharge the Contract of the said Couenant of bringinge in —80000 waight of Spanish Tobacco for without a Retribu?on there was litle hope or reason to expect so great a fauor of his Matie. Touchinge wch he proposed whither it were not fitt to desire of his Matie and their llps that they would please to accept of a fourth part of their Tobacco as was at first offered to the Lord Treasuror and that this retribu?on might be taken in Specie that is to saye in the Comodity of Tobacco rather then in money: This proposi?on was well approued of and beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (noe one dissentinge) desired it might be soe proposed to the Lord?. ffourthly whereas the Customers (as was informed by diuers of those that opposed the Contract) haue offred in fauor of the Plantations (as is pretended) to make abatement of 3d Custome whereby they shall onely paye but 3d ? pound wch the Companies notwithstandinge do finde to be more then by lawe is due vnto them, (they beinge by their Letters Patents to pay but only 5li ? Cent?) It was therefore moued that this allevia?on likewise in pointe of payment, might be humbly peti?oned of the Lord?, and that it beinge obtained it might accord- inghtly be inserted in the Articles of the Contract, but if the Cus- tomers shall not be willinge herevnto, then to beseech thier llps that the Companie may be ?mitted to take the benefitt of the lawe in defence of the priuiledges of their Patent, whereby his Matie also shall receaue much ease in his Third part, This Proposition was well approued of and by a generall erec?on of hand? no one dissentinge ordered it should accordingly be humbly offred to the Lord?. [242] ffiftly it beinge taken into considera?on whither it were fitt to moue the Lord? for mitiga?on of the fraight for his Mats part as he desired: It was generally conceaued fitt to passe it ouer and onely men?on it as an inducement to their other request? seinge the Companies cannot saue much thereby and yet the Supposi?on that the Kinge should loose much might be an impediment to their other desires. ?6.? That whereas by the Contract the Companies are to haue a sole sale, Sr Edwin Sandys propounded whither they did desire to haue a sole sale rather then to leaue it free for euery man to take out his two Third?, and leaue the Kinge his Third, considering if this generall liberty of a free sale should be graunted, both the generall sale would be much hindred and the Kings Third would hardly be sold at all: This Proposition after some delibera?on was put to the question and by a generall erec?on of hand? (no one dissentinge) the Companie agreed to insist vpon a sole sale, and ordered that their approba?on of a sole sale should accordingly be signified vnto the Lord?. Seauenthly Sr Edwin Sandys offered vnto the considera?on of the Companie whither they did not thinke fitt it be propounded to the Lord? in fauor of the poore Planters: That whereas by the Contract they are to Account for his Mats part euery halfe yeare; they hauinge bin informed that the Lord Treasuror wilbe pleased for reliefe of the Planters, that the payment be made but once a yeare at the yeares end to shewe that if it shall please their llps to graunt this fauor, they shall haue the better meanes to releiue the poore Planters as is desired it was by a generall erec?on of hand? denied (§no§ one dissenting) desired the Lord? might be moued herevnto. Lastly it was propounded to the consideracon and iudgement of the Court, that in case before the Lord? of the Counsell the Opposers should make some Proposition for the abatement of the Custome and Imposi?on, vpon condi?on the Companies yeald to bringe in all their Tobacco and there be left a free Importa?on from other places; whither the Companie did conceaue their estate bettered in this in this manner more then it was by the Contract, After longe and much debate, it beinge in the end put to the question, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? (noe one dissentinge) adiudged that these two condi?ons pro- pounded vizt that the Companie should be bound to bringe in all, and yet a freedome graunted to bringe in from other part? would vtterly ruine and ouerthrowe the Plantations and that [243] although the charges were brought downe to Six pence yet the damage would be farr greater then the ease. Accordinge to these seuerall head? proposed and agreed on the Cort earnestly desired the Lo: Cauendish Sr Iohn Dãuers Sr Edw: Sackuill 2 Deputies &amp; Collo: Ogle mr White Sr Rob: Killigrewe or any fower of them would please to drawe vp a Remonstrance of their said humble Proposition and Peti?on to the Lord? of the Priuy Counsell and present the same vnto their llps in the name of the Companie. A mo?on beinge made for a Co?ission for a Shippe wch mr Barbor sett? out for discouery and a fishinge voyage, The Court ordered a Co?is- sion to be drawne vp to that purpose and to be sealed.</field>

[244] The Lo: Cauendish signified that whereas at the last Court the Com- panie tooke into their considera?ons certaine Propositions wch after delibera?on they agreed should be moued vnto the Lord? of the Counsell and therevpon the Court appointed a Co?ittee to drawe the same vp in writinge and present it to their llps Accordingly the said Comittee proceeded and himselfe with diuers others presented it vnto the Lord? beinge this wch followeth together with the Remon- strance formerly ordered to be deliuered vnto the Lord? touchinge the Impossibility and great damage that would arise vnto the Plantation, by beinge bound to bringe in all. To the first writinge Sr Nathaniell Rich made replie vnto some part? thereof and withall offered a Pa? of Obiec?ons against the Contract: In the end after a long debate and many contesta?ons, aswell concerninge that as other buissines they were willed to withdrawe themselues, and within a while after the Customers beinge first called in some of the Companies also were called in, and the Lo: Treasuror signified vnto them that himselfe and the rest of the ?s were resolued to acquaint his Matie with the matter, but for themselues hey declared their opinion to decline incline, that the Companies should rather paye money as Sr Natha: Rich and the rest desired: As for the Kings part the Lord Treasuror said, there was no abatement to be expected, but for the Customers they were contented for the present to ?loose? 3d of their 6d. So that the pay- ment for the Tobacco at present should be but ixd. To the right Honorable the Lords and others of his Maties most Honoble Privy Counsell. The humble peti?on and Proposition of the Companies for Virginia and Su?er Iland?. We haue vnderstood from yor llps that notwithstandinge the Contract touch- inge Tobacco concluded with his Matie, It hath pleased him of his great grace and care of the Plantations to offer vnto the Companies a free delibera?on of some greater ease and benifitt, for the encouragement and advancement of the Companies and Collonies, wch it hath pleased also yor llps out of yor like noble disposi?ons, verie fauorably to co?end vnto vs, and withall to require, that as- well the Companies as the part opposite to the said Companies and Contract should reduce into writinge and soe offer the same to yor llps considera?on and iudgment. [245] In thankefull acknowledgement of this his Mats grace and duetifull obedience to yor llps graue direc?on, the Court? of the said Companies haue bin assem- bled and the part opposite desired to be present at the same Court?, that set- tinge aside all studie of fac?on and contradic?on wee might with the mayne force of reason, trye out what was most behoufull for the Plantations and so with vnanime consent present the same to yor llps fauourable veiwe. Howbeit notwithstandinge this our earnest desire the principall ?sons of the said Opposites vouchsafinge not their presence; Yet diuers of the Cittizens adheringe to their part were both present and heard at large propoundinge their opinions and reasons: After a longe serious and peaceable delibera?on of all the seuerall part? of the aforesaid Contract as also of some other newe Propositions wch had bin made, both the Court? with a generall and vnani- mous consent (no one dissentinge) concluded vpon these seuerall Articles of Proposition and Petition wch here in all due?ty? wee most humbly offer to yor llps better considera?on and fauourable acceptance if they shall appeare so to deserue. ffirst touchinge the sole Importa?on of Tobacco to be graunted to the said Companies together with the inhibitinge of the plantinge thereof within his Mats Kingdomes of England and Ireland beinge the principall part and funda- mentall part of the said of the Contract: wee conceaue that without the ?fect- inge and continuinge of this Graunt for these seauen yeares agreed on, neither of the Plantations as nowe can possiblie subsist: The Su?er Iland? beinge scarce capable of that soyle and §any other§ Co?oditie by reason the earth lyeth so shallowe vpon the Rocks, and the better comodities lately sett vp in Virginia requiringe some reasonable time for their encrease and ?fec?on. ffor although in former times when the quantitie of Tobacco from the Planta- ?ons was smale, and that imported from other forraigne part? was likewise not great, the vent of both might stand together and both the one and the other beare an indifferent price, yet nowe the quantities of both beinge manifoldly doubled must need? soe ouercloye the markett? for Sale, that without the restrayninge thereof by a sole Importation1 1 For the insertion between the lines and in the margin by Collingwood, and continued by the copyist to page 000, see Plate 00. ?the price thereof must need? fall to so vnvaluable a rate as not to defray the verie custome and other neces- sarie charges: Secondly it being true wch was deliuered before yor llpps that meaner sorte of Tobacco in Spayne??§may be bought at this day for the value of 6d or 12d at the most wch happeneth by reason ye Tobacco of the West Indies is made by the Negroes and other Slaues at a verie smale charge &amp; con- trariwise the Tobacco in the very Plantations themselues beinge rated by the Planters at a much higher value, besid? ye custome here Some and other charges necessary It must need? followe that the Spanish Tobacco wilbe here much the cheaper and consequently ouerthrowe the Sale of that of the Planta?on. A third reason wee will only touch and soe leaue to yor llps much dee? consid- era?on beinge ye same that moued ye lower howse in ye late assembly of Par- liamt to passe a Bill to like effect for the sole Importa?on, where it was made manifest by the experience and confession of all ye Spanish m9chant? yt the liberty of importinge of Spanish Tobacco, what by the price of the Tobacco it selfe &amp; what by the vndersale of our Natiue Co?odities for the procuringe thereof was to the damage &amp; losse vnto this Kingdome of at least 100000li sterling by the yeare wch el? might be returned in Coyne &amp; Bullion for or said natiue Comodities, Besid? it was conceaued yt nothinge could be more honoble or iusti- fiable for a State then to establish the Vent of the Subiect? naturall Comodity, such as is the Tobacco growinge in the said Planta?on; before the importinge of the like forraigne Comodities from other part? wch could not be but to the hurt and greivance of the Subiect wch course is also held firme and setled by sundrie prouident and pollique constitu?ons both in § in Spaine it selfe and many other Christian Dominions, So that the Companies most humblie beseech first his Matie and then yor llps, that for the matter of sole Importation by the said Companies there may be no altera?on from the graunt intended in the said Contract, wch they conceaue cannot be without the ruine of both the Planta- tions hauing hitherto wrought and traffiqued vpon a wastinge Stocke, wch they hope by this graunt may nowe at length be renued. And as touchinge the obliga?on laid vpon the Companies by the said Contract for the bringinge in of fowerscore thousand waight of Varinaes Tobacco in the first two or three yeares: yor llps may be pleased to be advertized that vpon the makinge of the said Proposition by the Right Honoble the Lord Treasuror, wch not till the Treaty of the said Contract had bin on foote for a good space, the Co?ittees for the said treaty authorized by the Companies did present vnto his lp: eight waightie reasons, against the said Proposition wch reasons were afterward approued by the Court?, but his lp: for more important reasons as it seemed knowne vnto himselfe insistinge still vpon the said Proposition, in such sorte that without yealdinge therevnto the Contract could not [246] pro- ceed: The Companies rather then to loose so benificiall a Graunt as the matter of sole Importation, in fine also assented vnto that Proposi?on Howbeit if it may please his most Graceous Matie and yor noble llps to discharge the Contract of that Proposition either in whole or part they shall with all duety acknowl- edge it for a most remarqueable fauor: yet rather then infringe the vertue or dissolue the body of the said Contract they do ?againe? vnanimously submitt themselues to the said Proposition. Concerninge the retribu?on to be made vnto his Matie by vertue of the said Contract and in leiue of his grace, yor llps may also please to be aduertised that the first offer made on the Companies behalfe to the Lord Treasuror was only of a fourth part of all their Tobacco but his lp: by computa?on of the quantities of Tobacco likely yearely to be brought in, conceauinge that the said fourth part would not make vp that Revenue wch his Matie had formerly receaued for that sole Importa?on, and insistinge vpon a Third part, the Com- panies in demonstra?on of their great thankfullnes vnto his Matie for the said sole Importation assented to that third, neither for any thinge that they haue yet heard from the opposite ?t, see any iust cause to repent them of: Not- withstandinge if it shall please his Matie out of his abundant goodnes to vouch- safe the acceptance of their first offer of a fourth part, they shall not onely acknowledge and publish his Maties said goodnes, but also studiously apply themselues to their vtmost endeauors to raise to his Matie so large a proffitt out of that fourth part, as may be, answearable to the expecta?on of mayn- teyninge the former Revenue. The next cosiderable pointe in the Contract is ?in? the matter of custome, wherein the Companies haue yealded to paye vjd ? li for Roll Tobacco and 4d for leafe for so much thereof as shall belonge to their ?t?; Nowe forasmuch as diuers of the Opposite ?t, haue informed the Courts that the Customers are nowe willinge in fauor of the Plantations to take onely 3d the pound one with another: They are bold vpon this occasion to renue vnto yor llps remembrance that wch formerly they haue deliuered to this Honoble Bourd vizt That by his Maties Letters Patent? of founda?on of the said Plantation the Companies and their Successors both Aduenturers and Planters are for euer discharged from all Taxes and imposi?ons to be laid by his Matie his heires and Successors excepting onely the fiue ? cent? after the vse of Marchant?, and seinge that 6d ? li for roll Tobacco and 4d for leafe expressed in the printed booke of rat? was sett before there was any Tobacco in the said Plantations and there is an order sett downe in the said booke of rat? that for all other Comodities o?itted in the said Booke they shalbe valued by Marchant? from time to time as there shalbe occasion: The Companies did agreeably therevnto peti?on that for the Tobacco of ye Planta?ons (beinge not of halfe the value to the Spanish Tobacco ?wch? was rated in that booke at Ten shilling? Roll, and Six Shilling? eight pence leafe Tobacco the [247] pound) there might be a newe and indifferent valua?on made by it selfe accordingly as was donn in the same Booke, for lynnen and Wynes of the same kind? but of different Countries, respect alwayes beinge had to the ?true? value of the Co?oditie: Divers of yor llps also may be pleased to remember that vpon his Mats Procla- mation for prohibitinge the plantinge of Tobacco in this Realme the said Com- panies beinge called before the Lord? then Comissioners for the Treasurie and treated with for the payinge of 12d the pound for Roll Tobacco, and 10d for leafe that is to say for an addi?on of 6d ? li to the said former rat?: The Com- panies in thankfull acknowledgment of his Mats grace did yeald therevnto for the terme õly of fiue yeares; yet with this protesta?on that they did yeald onely 3d the pound for the Custome and the rest in thankfull retribu?on to his Matie wch Proposition they desired might be entred in their ?ps Record?: The Companies (yet ?therefore? without intent to infringe the said Contract in any thinge) most humbly beseech yor ?ps that if the Customers be content to accept of the said 3d for Custome, wch in lawe and equity is more then their due that the same may be accordingly ?sett? downe in this Contract: But if the Customers as some conceaue haue onely made this offer to drawe on the Customers Companies into farr greater inconveniences, (amongst wch the depriu- inge them of the said sole Importa?on) then in that case they shall become most humble Suitors vnto yor ?ps that with yor ?ps good fauor they may try the validity of their Patent? with the said Customers, and pay them so much as by iudgement of lawe shall fall out to be due vnto them. And ?as? touchinge the sole sale of all Tobacco imported to be likewise man- aged by the Companies, they havinge taken it againe into verie serious con- sidera?on do finde by all reason and experience of Marchaunt? that it will greatly aduance the price of the Comodity and consequently as well that of his Mats part as that of the Aduenturers and Planters And as for the reasons made by the Opposite part they conceaue them to be light and priuate, ?as? tendinge only to the aduantage of some fewe who either by vsurpa?on or oppressiue courses in the Plantations or here at home by some extraordinary art and dex- terity beinge able to ouerreach or outgoe their fellowes desire to goe single from them in all their courses, but to the generall good (wch the Companies are bound to respect) they hold the contrarie Proposition to be extreamely preiudiciall. Lastly concerninge the poore Planters of whome the Companies haue (as they ought) a speciall reguard yor llps may please to be informed that the quantitie of Tobacco brought home in right of their proprietie is for the most part verie smale it beinge expended in the Planta?ons amongst the Marchant? tradinge thither with their seuerall necessarie Comodities But for the poore Planters wch [248] themselues came ouer in ?son and need a more speedie returne then the ordinary course of the Companies sale may perhapps afford, there haue been diuers extraordinary wayes taken into considera?on and concluded on by the Court?, too longe here to trouble yor llps with the expressinge of them in ?ticular beinge ready if yor llps require to be shewed vnto you out of their book?. And whereas it hath bin informed by some in the Court? that the Lord ?Trer? in reliefe of the said poore Planters and for the furnishinge of them with readie money would be content that his Mats part should be paid in at one payment at the end of the yeare: They conceaue that the addi?on of this extraordinary fauor will giue the Companie abundant meanes for the poore Planters reliefe whereof the Companies shall make vse accordingly. ffinally the said Companies with vnanimous consent in all sincerity and duety are bold to affirme and that confidently to yor ?ps that hauinge thus taken the Contract assunder into his seuerall part? and reexamined the same with their best vnderstandinge and skill they doe not finde any iust cause of so greiuous complaint against it, as hath bin made by those men who beinge Members of the Companie and most of them hauinge bin present at the negotiatinge of the said Contract and hauinge giuen their expresse consent vnto it, do nowe vpon priuate humor oppose against it, valuinge their owne will? aboue co?on con- sent and the iust rules of gouerment: Notwithstandinge if it shall please his Matie and yor Honoble llps in tender care and fauor of the said Plantations to graunt a qualifica?on of the point? of the Contract before expressed: both the Companies and Planta?ons shall thereby receaue a singuler encouragemt to proceed in their labourious and costly courses of bringinge the said Planta?ons to their desired ?fec?on and remaine euer studious by their vttermost endeauors to expresse their thankefulnes first to his Matie and then to yor llps for the same: And howsoeuer the Companies vnanimously desire that the said Contract may proceed, and be continued for these seauen yeares formerly accorded.</field>

After this there was read the Letter receaued by ye Iames from the Gouernour and Counsell of Virginia, who desiring that their humble thank? might be presented to his Matie for his gracious fauour in that supply of Armes &amp; Munition sent them; the performance thereof was recomended by the Court to Sr Edward Sackuill; who was also desired vpon fitt opportunity to moue his Matie for ye ffoure hundred young persons formerly peti?oned.1 1 This is probably the letter referred to in List of Records, No. 400, Vol. I, page 163, ante. Mr Palauicine moued in mr Wrotes name for a coppy of his Sentence, wch was ordered accordingly should be giuen him by the Secretary. Sr Nathaniell Rich said, that hauing had of late speech wth the Lo: Treasuror, he vnderstood from him soemuch, as he conceaued, that if the Companies would peti?on, they might haue the Sole Importa?on of Tobacco, wth the excep?on onely of fforty thousand weight of Spanish Tobacco to be brought in yearely; wherein they should haue more fauour then any other vndertakers; He therefore moued, that the Companies would accordingly peti?on the Lord Treasuror. This mo?on was by some liked [250] and approued, who affirmed, that the Companies hauing the graunt of bringing in the Spanish Tobaccoes might farme it out to others and thereby gayne 1000li yea perhaps 2000li a yeare. But herevnto answere was made, that it were better for ye Company, that the Importa?on of Spanish Tobacco (since it must need? be graunted) should be in Strangers hand? then in ye Com- panies; who could better looke to it, &amp; prevent the stealing in, then they could; wch could not be done by them, but by raysing a great deale of charge for Salaryes (a thinge soemuch declaymed against) And for the matter of Sole Importa?on, wch the Companies had soe- much desired, that was a totall exclusion of all forraigne Tobacco wch the Companies sought for; But if there was a necessity, that a cer- tayne quantity of forraigne Tobacco must be brought, it was all one to the Planta?ons, whither it were in the Companies or others hand?; But if soe be it could not ?not? be procured ?from? his Matie and the Lo: Treasuror, that a Sole Importa?on of Tobacco should be graunted to the Companies, wth a forbidding of all others (except for some smale quantity) and that for Two or Three yeares at ye most, and this to be confirmed by his Mats L?es Pattents, and that together wth the abatement of Three pence in ye pound and the Companies left to their libertie to bring in what they pleased; that were indeed a singuler fauour vnto the Plantations, and the Companies should be highly beholding to those Gentlemen by whose meanes it should be procured &amp; obteyned. As for this mo?on (as it was propounded) it was not conceaued to be any more in substance, then that whereas there is a quantity of 40000 wtt of Spanish Tobacco to be brought in, the Companies should haue the farming of it, wch was not conceaued any such benefitt, as the Companies should moue therefore. But in case there were an intent to graunt a free importa?on of all sort? of Tobacco vnstinted, wch in reguard, that the State had see wth soe much prudence, reduced to the quantity of 60000 weight, was not to be imagined the free importa?on, hauing beene found soe great a detriment and damage vnto this kingdome: It was then generally adiudged, that the Court ought to vse all possible meanes &amp; dilligence to prevent that wch would vtterly vndoe the Planta?ons. Wherefore Sr Nathaniell Rich was desired by the Court, to bring his Propositions well digested, &amp; fully to informe himselfe, what fauours they might hope to obtaine &amp; vpon what retribu?on; for as the Prop- osition was now made, it was not conceaued any thinge beneficiall, or that the Companies should stirr in it. There was presented to this Court a peti?on of Captaine Iohn Martins; wherein he declared wth much thank? his humble acceptance of the Pattent that was offered him ?by the Company? although in ye matter of rent it differed from the Earle of Southamptons. And whereas it was signified, that Captaine Martin being by his sayd Pattent to haue [251] his Land sett out and bounded wth in the Territories of Martin Brandon he desired these word? might be added, namely, in that place whereof he was formerly possessed: And further that in the Habendum of his sayd Pattent after the word? Waters, Riuers, there might be added these Two word? Marshes, Swamps Cr wch the Court agreed vnto &amp; ordered the Secr? should putt them in. And touching his Three demaund? in his sayd Peti?on, the Court hath promised, first that if it shalbe found by any Court Roll, either here in England, or in Virginia, that the first and ancient Planters should haue ffiue hundreth acres for a share (as he supposeth), he shall haue the same propor?on allowed him; or if any larger Pattent shalbe graunted hereafter, he shall haue the like fauour vpon his peti?on for ye enlargemt of his. Touching his second request for some allowance out of ye publi? for his place of Mastership of the Ordiñnce, as other Officers lately gone ouer haue had; the Court hath promised, that when the Publi? shalbe able to spare any men, his request shalbe taken into considera?on. Concerning his Third request for a Comission to the Gouernor &amp; Counsell of Virginia, to examine the wrongs &amp; detriment? done vnto him by Sr George Yeardley in the time of his Gouernemt since; &amp; that vpon proofe thereof made, they may cause him to make restitu?on; The Court hath ordered, that direc?on shalbe giuen by L?e to the Gouernour &amp; Counsell there to proceed therein accordingly as is desired; who shalbe entreated to affoord Captaine Martin all lawfull fauour, as to iustice shall apprtaine. The Court being moued for a Pattent for mr Roper &amp; mr ffitzieffories vndertaking to transport One hundred persons, &amp; being to goe ouer themselues this next Shipping to Virginia, ordered a Pattent to be drawne vp for them against the Quarter Court. Vpon mo?on for a Comission for ye George for transporting Passen- gers to Virginia, the Court ordered a Comission to be drawne vp.</field>

[252] The Lo: Cauendish acquainted the Company, that the cause of call- ing this Court at soe vnseasonable a time, was to acquaint them, how that Alderman Iohnson together wth some others his Associat? had presented a peti?on to his Matie complayning much of the misgov- ernemt of the Companies and Planta?ons these Last ffoure yeares; wch to the intent it might not make any impression in his Royall breast to ye preiudice of the Company, his Lop conceaued, that the Company were to thinke of some present course, to giue his Matie satisfac?on by a true Declara?on both of the State of the Colony, &amp; of the cariage of businesses here at home by the Company. But to the intent they might proceed herein wth greater certainty, the Court sent some of the Company to mr Alderman Iohnson, to desire him, either to bring or send them a copie of that peti?on, wch he had deliuered; who returned answere by them, that he had noe coppy of the Peti?on, nor did knowe of any that did keepe a coppy thereof, and that the Peti?on was not against ye Company; wch was likewise affirmed by some of them who were present in Court, &amp; had beene at the deliuery of that peti?on; desiring the Company not to engage themselues therein, vntill they sawe the Peti?on (professing that they intended the good of the Planta?on and the Company as much as any other) Wherevpon they were desired to declare what it was they had com- playned of; &amp; who the persons were, it being sayd by the Lo: Cauen- dish, that if they did not finde themselues agrieued wth the Company, they ought not to haue complayned to his Matie, vntill they had acquaynted the Court wth their grievanc?, &amp; seene what remedy by them would haue beene applyed. Wherevpon mr Palavicine (being one of them that was at the deliuery of the peti?on) sayd, that the things wch they chiefly complayned of, were perhaps such as the Company had beene often moued about, &amp; would giue noe redresse in. Wherevpon Sr Edward Sackuille sayd, that although Ald?an Iohnson would not send a coppy of ye peti?on, yet himselfe and some others in ye Court, could fully &amp; certaynly informe the Company of the sub- stance thereof. He sayd therefore, that Peti?on was in effect a com- parison of the Gouernemt in former tymes wth the latter ffower yeares, &amp; that in Three point?. ffirst that in former times, the Gouernemt was soe mild &amp; moderate, as a multitude of Aduenturers were brought in; but now there was much oppression and iniury offred both to Aduenturers &amp; Planters. Secondly that whereas formerly things were carryed quietly both here and in ye Planta?ons; now there was nothing but conten?ons &amp; dis- sentions to ye ruyne allmost and ouerthrowe of the Planta?ons. Thirdly that whereas diuers excellent Comodityes were formerly sett vp, now there was nothing but Smoke &amp; Tobacco. Wherevpon they desired his Matie that a Comission might be awarded, that these things might be amended. This being deliuered vpon his certen knowledge to be the substance of ye Peti?on &amp; confirmed by ye Lo: Cauendish, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? conceaued, that this Peti?on and Complaint was against the Company it selfe; and so that they accordingly ought to iustify themselues, &amp; to defend their proceedings against these vniust &amp; vntrue informa?ons [253] but yet withall for ye very issue of ye Peti?on it selfe, the Court liked very well, and by erec?on of hand? ordered, that a Peti?on should be prsented to his Matie in ye name of the Company, to beseech his Matie that the Lord? of ye Counsell might haue ye examina?on of these things, and that their Innocency or guiltines might be cleared or punished. And in ye meane while, for a true informa?on of his Matie, the Lo: Cauendish presented to ye Court Two seuerall writings, the one being a declara?on of the State of Vir- ginia comparatiuely wth what had beene done in former tymes, wch by order of the Earle of Sout?ton was drawne vp by some of the Coun- sell at Christmas Last: Wch being now read and weighed from point to point, was wth some small altera?ons approued and confirmed by ye Court, &amp; ordered to be deliuered to his Maty as their Act, being this wch followeth vizt. A Declara?on of the present State of Virginia humbly presented to the Kings most excellent Matie by the Company for Virginia. May it please your Matie In the end of December in ye yeare—1618—being the Twelueth yeare1 1 The rest of this declaration is in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar's assistant, Thomas Collett(?). after ye begininge of this Planta?on and after the expence of ffourskore thousand pounds and vpwards of the Publi? Stocke besides other Sums of voluntary Planters ther were remayninge then in the Colony aboute Six hundred ?sonns men, weomen and Children and Cattle aboute Three hundred att the moste. And the Company was then lefte in debt neer ffive Thousand pound. Att this time through (Gods blessinge) notwthstandinge the great mortalities wch in some of these fower latter years, haue generally seized vppon all those ?ts of America and besides the last ?late? Massacre of aboute three hundred and ffiftie personns and a great mortallytie therby occasioned by beinge dryven from their Habita?ons and ?visionns, there are remayninge as wee compute aboue ffive and Twenty hundred ?sonns sent wth the expence onely of Thirty Thousand pounds of the publique Stock besides the charges of perticuler Societies and Planters, And ye Cattle what by new Supplies and what by encrease of the former provision, are multiplyed to aboue one Thousand of beast? Besides Goates and of Swine an infinite nomber. And the old Debt of ye Compa: hath been discharged. Att ye begininge of these last 4 years ye onely Comodities of price and vppon wch onely a Valua?on was sett to maynteyne the Trade were Tobacco and Sax- afras, ffor in ye two last years before ther was no course taken for ye settinge vpp of any other through ye pouerty of ye Compa: Duringe these 4 last years there hath been expended in settinge vpp of Iron Work? (ye Oare wherof is ther in great plenty and excellent) aboue ffive Thousand pound?: wch worke beinge brought in a manner to ?fec?on was greatly interupted by the late Massacre, butt ordered to be restored againe wth all possible dilligence. ffor the makinge of Wine itt is to be knowne yt the soyle there doth of itt selfe produce Vines in greate aboundance and some of a verie good sorte, besides divers Plants haue been sent thither of the better kindes of Christen- dome. Ther have been allso sent thither Eight Vigneroones ?cured from Langue- dock, &amp; carefull order hath been taken for the settinge vpp of that Comoditie, wch wee doubt not in short time will shewe itt selfe in great plenty. And had not the buisines been interrupted by ye Massacree err this the effect? had been seen, there beinge divers Vyneyeards planted in the Country wherof some conteyned Tenn thousand Plantes. ffor Silke the Country is full of Mulberytrees of the best kinde and generall order taken for the plantinge of them aboundantly in all places inhabited. True itt is that for the Silkworme seed itt hath till this last year by divers accydents misscarryed to ye great greife of the Compa: haveinge had large sup- plies therof from yor Mats: store. Butt in September last wee have sent neer 80 ounces wth soe extraordinary care &amp; ?vision yt wee doubt not itt will pros? and yeild a plentifull returne ther beinge sent allsoe men skillfull to Instruct the Planters for allthings belonginge to bringe ye Silke to ?feccon: And wee have notice that the seed hath been received saffe and order given for the dis- ?singe and nourishinge them through the wholl Planta?on. [254] There have been sentt allsoe att the great charge of the Compa: skillfull men ?cured from Germanie for settinge vpp of Sawinge Mill? and divers Ship- wright? from hence for makinge Boates and Ships. And other for Saltworkes and others for other Comodities, ye good effect wherof wee doubt not will shortlie appeare. Wee will not heer inlarge in declaringe the greate and assiduall care wch ye Counsell and Company wth their principall Officers have from time to time taken aswell in reclayminge the Colony from ouermuch followinge Tobacco (every man beinge now stinted to a certaine proportion) as allso in settinge forward those other Staple and Rich Comodities aswell by the Charges and provisionns aforesaid as likewise by settinge vppõ them a Competent valua- ?on, not Doubtinge butt that whosoever wilbe pleased to take the paines to ?vse their frequent ?res, Instruc?ons and Charters to that effect together wth sundry printed Books made purposely and published for their help &amp; direc?on (the full veiwe wherof is ?hibited to no man) wilbe farr from censuringe them for any omission. Neither may wee forbear to doe that right to ye Gouernor Counsell, &amp; other principall Officers now resydinge in Virginia as not to testi- fie their solicitous care and industry in puttinge in exec?on our desires and direccons as appeareth by their Proclamation and other orders to be seene. Touchinge the Gouermt itt hath in these 4 latter years been soe reformed accordinge to yor Mats originall direc?ons yt ye people who in former times wer discontent and mutinous by reason of their vnassurance of all things through want of order &amp; iustice live now amongst in themselvs in great peace and tranquillytie each knowinge his owne and what hee is mutually to receaue and ?forme. And to ye end yt worthy personns may be allured to those places of Counsell &amp; Gouermt and all occasion of Rapine and extor?on be removed the Counsell &amp; Compa have now att their very great charge caused to be sett vpp a Compe- tent annuall ?vision and revennue for mayntenance of ye Gouernor wth other Magistrates and Officers &amp; ?ticularly of ye Mynistry accordinge to ye degree and quallytie of each pson place Neither have these our cares &amp; courses been vneffectuall but as they have setled ye Colony there in a great content and quyett soe have they raysed here att home soe great a fame of Virginia that not onely men of meaner estates as att the first by necessity; but many ?sons of good sorte out of choyce and good likinge have removed themselvs thither &amp; are dayly in ?vydinge to remoue. There haue been in these 4 years graunted 44 Patents for Land to Personns who have vndertaken each of them to transporte one hundred men att the least: wheras in ye former Twelue year? ther wer not aboue Six. There have com in Tenn times more now Adventurers in these 4 last years then in almoste twise yt time before. So yt wheras in former times ther were sometimes hardly gott Twenty to keep the Quarter Courte there are now seldome less then two hundred and sometimes many more. There haue been imployed in these 4 last years fforty-two saile of Ships most of them of great burthen; wheras in 4 years before ther were not aboue Twelue. Wee may not heer omitt one extraordinary blessinge yt itt hath pleased God in these 4 last years soe to excite ye hearts of well minded people to extend their aide toward ye forwardinge of this Glorious worke yt there hath been con- tributed toward itt in presents to ye value of ffifteen hundred pounds by zeal- ous and deuoute ?sonns most of them refusinge to be named of wch fruite the ?cedinge years were altogether barren. Itt cannot be denyed butt itt is to be deplored wth much sorrow yt the bless- inge of God appearing in the encrease and prosperitie of the Planta?on drew on that bloody resolu?on from ye Infidles &amp; as itt is conceaued hath excited here att home divers troublesome Opposi?ons by personns (itt seemeth) little favouringe Virginia's ?speritie. But the one as wee hope wilbe sharplie revenged, &amp; ye other must be borne wth patience and wth constancie ouercom. To conclude for ye better securinge of the Planta?on besides ye continuall sending of multitudes of people &amp; shippinge (wherof ther were lately aboute Christmas last Seaventeen Sayle in Iames River in Virginia) The Counsell and Compa: to their great charge have given order for ye erecting of a fforte in a convenient place in the same River to keep out fforraigne Invasion till better ?paracon be made. And if yor Maty: beinge ye first founder &amp; great Supporter of this Ac?on (wch will remaine a Constant Monumt of yor Glorious name for ever) wilbe pleased yt ye four hundred young &amp; able men desyred by ye Compa: &amp; not denyed butt respited may now att length be levyed in such manner as was peti?oned and sent to Virginia for ye rootinge out of those Treacherous and Barbarous Mur- derers as also for the Supply of ye Planta?on in ?ts yett defective: Wee doubt not butt in short time to yeild vnto yor Maty soe good and reall Account of the fruits of our cares endeavours and labours, as may be answerable to our Duetie and yor Princely expecta?on. [255] The1 1 The handwriting here returns to that of the copyist referred to as the "first copyist." second writing that his Lop shewed, was, A Relation of ye pro- ceedings of ye Virginia and Su?er Ilands Companies in answere of some Imputations laid vpon them, together with the discouery of the groundes of such Vniust obiections, and a Remedy propounded for auoiding the like Inconveniencies hereafter. Wch discourse his Lop said himselfe had drawne vp, for satisfac?on of some very Noble personag?, who vpon sinister informa?ons of the Companies proceedings, seemed to haue entertayned some hard conceipt of them. But vpon reading of this discourse, they remayned very well satisfied of the fairenes &amp; iustnes of the Companies proceedings in those seuerall point? the like effect he hoped they would worke in his Matie. Wherevpon the sayd Relation (being this wch followeth) was read, and euery seuerall part &amp; branch thereof being duly weighed and considered of, was by it selfe putt to ye question, and by a generall erec?on of hand? euery branch of it was confirmed &amp; approued as ye Act &amp; answere of the Company there being not aboue Three hand? against any one point of it, &amp; most of them confirmed wthout the dissenting of any one. And it was further ordered, that these Two writings, together wth the peti?on should be deliuered to his Maty; And to that end were humbly entreated the Lo: Cauendish Lo: Lawarr Sr Edw: Sackuill Sr Io: Brooke &amp; Collonell Ogle to take ye first opportunity that might be, it being left vnto them- selues to make choise of such other of the Company, as they would should attend them. A relation of ye late proceedinges of ye Virginia and Su?er Ilandes Companies, in answere to some imputa?ons laid vpon them, together with the discouery of ye groundes of such vniust obiec?ons, and a Rem- edy proposed for better auoyding the like inconveniencies hereafter; Humbly presented to ye Kinges most Excellent Matie by the said Com- panies.1 1 This document is in the Public Record Office, Manchester Papers, No. 360. The handwriting is similar to that of the first copyist of the Court Book. List of Records, No. 462, Vol. I, page 170, ante. May it please your Matie 2 2 The rest of the relation is in the handwriting of Nicholas Ferrar's assistant, referred to above as Thomas Collett. Itt is manyfest that divers misinformations have been deliuered and those pub- liquely to the most materiall wherof a true and justificable answere heere ensueth. 1 The first obiection is: That some few of the Company Lead and ouersway ye Courtes, and in the perticuler buisines of ye Contract intending their owne priuate especially in poynte of Salary, haue for yt cause perswaded &amp; mislead ye Court?. Misleadinge. Itt is true that some particuler personns to their great paines charge and trouble wth out hope or expecta?on of proffitt have imployed their time and endeauours in considera?on of what might tend to the good and benifitt of both Planta?ons and that onely wth purpose to propose and Comunicate to the Court? their faythfull advise: wch is both the duety and in the power of every ?ticuler member of these Societies: And that this diligence should be interpreted a Captivatinge or misleadinge of the Courts wherin they onely co?unicate their opinions wth out any aforehand conclusion wch is neither in their power nor intentions is a verie vniust censure and a hard requitall to those ?sons who for a generall good neglect so much time &amp; so many opportunities for their owne pryvate. [256] ffor the Supposi?on yt in respect of the Salary these men should misguide the Court? to the preiudice of the Planta?ons the meer nar- rative of ye occasionn carryage and necessitie of that buisines wee suppose will sufficiently cleer them. Answere The menaginge of the intended Contract was vppon large delibera?on by ye Counsell of Virginia and the Co?ittees designed for that buisines conceaued to be so great and troublesome an imployment as would wholly take vpp the Officers times and itt was by none conceaued reasonable (imposinge soe great a burthen) to exact mens Labours, wth out a propor?onable requitall for their paines, especially their imploymt in this case beinge for the ?ticuler raysinge &amp; advantage of seuerall ?sonns private estates by the higher sale of this Com- oditie, and ther was never example of men thus imployed wth out Salary, this beinge a buisines of meer merchandize and of distinct nature from a Plantation and the Gouerment therof. Besides itt is a guessinge vncharitable censure to say that the Salaries were aymed att by those since elected: ffor ye Salaries and Offices were first agreed vppon before ye personns were chosen. And for those yt were elected to the two great Sallaries against wch they doe most obiect itt is certaine that both in publique and pryvate att sundry times they vsed all possible endeauor and industry to keep themselvs from being chosen butt the experience the Companies had of their faythfullnes and abilli- ties made them to be chosen, and so in a manner forced them to this imploy- ment against their will?. And though in some Quarter Court? since their election they have as much as in them lay surrendred their Offices yett ye Court? would never admitt therof, and further a Proposi?on beinge offered by the first principall Obiector for the managinge of the buisines with less expence, itt was absolutely after a ?ticuler and exact examina?on refused by the iudgment of both Court? wch allsoe by question deliuered their opinion that they would trust no man in a matter of that waight that ?would? offer himselfe to vndergoe itt wth out Salary or soe little as was there proposed. And after all these obiections and clamors against them ye Last Quarter Court? vppon a longe and full debate did fully conclud and confirme ye Offices Officers and Salaries in ye same manner &amp; forme as in the Qua: Courtes before they had been agreed on. Lastly wheras they fortifie their Clamor wth the greatnes of the Salary (vizt) 2500li ? Ann? that is vntrue for to all the Officers chosenn by the Companies ther was onely allotted Seauenteen hundred pounds ? Ann? The other 800li was layd by for such necessary occasions as could not be ayoyded and this 800li was in the iudgment of the §Lord§ Treasurer a proporcon rather too little then too great: Butt out of all yor Maty by the Contract was to pay a third parte, and countinge vppon the 1700li for ?of mere? Sallary yor Mats Third is neer 600li, and the propor?on intended to be layd on the Spanish Tobacco would have saved 600li more: Soe yt the charge remayninge to the Companies would not §have§ amounted at ye most butt to 600li: and that would easily have bin defrayed by ye imposi?on of a penny the pound of Tobacco: And yett this small charge muste not be vnderstood to be laid by the Companies duringe the wholl seaven years of the Contract butt onely for one yeare beinge of all other ye moste difficult; Soe that if they had found itt too heavy they might for ye next year have altered their course, and eased their charge if they found it either possible or convenyent. 2 The Second obiection is §yt ye Court? are§ ouerswayed, and perticularly were soe in this buisines of ye Contract by informinge ye Courtes yt itt was prest vppon them by ye Kinge. [257] Ouerswayinge. Itt is a strange boldnes for any especially beinge of our Company and know- inge ye ?ceedings therof yett to be soe ouerbold as to affirme a thinge so manyfestly false for itt hath been divers times profest in Court? by sundry Cittizens that they neuer in any Society whersoeuer they had been, found that liberty of Speech and vote or the Court? carryed wth that modera?on and Temper as these of Virginia and the Su?mer Ilands. Answeare. Moreouer the Companies are soe assured of the falsitie of this scandall that itt was one of the principall causes why mr Wrote who was the first that layde yt imputation vppon the Court? was censured: Besides in the Quarter Courte the firste of ffebruary ther beinge present aboue two hundred personns, somethinge that had been spoken by Sr Henry Mild- may caused the Courte to beleive that yor Maty: had been abused by this reporte therfore itt was then putt to the question, wheither the Court? were ouerawed or had not soe much liberty of speach as they desyred itt was by a generall erec?on of hands (no one dissentinge) denyed. And after in the Courts of the 5th of March vppon occasion that by some, the day before att the Counsell Table itt was sayd yt men were ouerawed to giue their consent for the Contract, itt was againe putt to the question, and by a generall erec?on of hands no one dissentinge denyed as before, and also further affirmed that this matter was carryed fayrly, and by strength onely of reason appearinge to the Court? and not otherwise. The Contract in respect of importa?on from the Planta?ons onely was ever propounded to the Court as a matter of great grace and favour from yor Maty: And in the treaty aboute itt wth the Lord Treasurer, who was ye first proposer of itt when the retribu?on of a third was by him vrged as allso the bringinge in of 80?Thousand waight of Spanish Tobacco in two years: The Comittees by the Court? appoynted to negotiate this buisiness with the Lord Treasuror vsed all their endeavour to bringe this Third to a ffourth, and against the Importa?on of Spanish Tobacco gaue his Lop: eight reasons in writinge, but neither of these two desires were entertayned and so the Comittees returned their Labours vnto the Court?, declaringe vnto them that vppon these Termes and no otherwise they might have ye Sole importa?on wch the Courts takinge into their most serious Delibera?on, considering in what case they had been in former years, sometimes forbidden by reason of other Contractors to bringe in any Tobacco sometimes co?aunded to bring in all they conceyved that by entertayninge this bargaine thus though itt wer not soe good as they desyred, yett comparatively they should be in a better state then they have been here- tofore: And soe afterwards vppon this onely reason the Contract hath bine confirmed by ?in? Six seuerall Quarter Courtes. The third obiection is that these persons Vppon whome these intentionns are vniustly layde when they could not carry matters by pluralyty of Voyces did draw on and spynn out ye Court? till eleuen a Clock at night by wch means they that were againste some part? concerning ye Man- aginge of ye Contract beinge ouerwearied wth so longe sittinge did depart. 3 Protactinge of ye Courts Itt is true that this day here ment the Court? sate till about Tenn a Clocke butt vppon these Occasions. Ther were divers long Courts to be read, princi- pally concerninge the offences of mr Wrote who that day was to receaue the iudgment and censure of this Quarter Courte, and the very handlinge of this buisines continued till after Seaven a Clock. Answere. The same day allsee was held ?also? a Virginia Courte wth power of a Quarter Courte deryved from the Quarter Courte ittselfe wch was held the Wednesday before by reason, that ye Lo: Treasuror was not then fully resolved to give his assent to every ?ticulerr of the Contract as was before agreed on. [258] But this Day haveinge comunicated all the Articles of ye Contract wth ye Lords of the Pryuy Counsell about 5 a Clock att night hee sent itt vnto vs by Sr Arthur Ingram, signed wth his hand entire as before onely wth this intimation yt wheras before the Companies were to have had forthwith a Proclama?on for the sole Importa?on by the Companies and for restrayninge of bringinge in all other Tobacco then that of the Planta?ons, savinge that within: 2: or three years they were enioyned to bringe in 80?Thousand waight of the best Spanish Tobacco: The Companies were now desyred to be content to forbeare the pub- lishinge of this Proclamation though concluded on by the Contract for three or fower monneths: And this at that time beinge a new Proposition, butt such a one as hadd the waight to make the bargaine either fall or proceed and that beinge the last day wherin by the Patent and orders of the Companies they are enhabled to conclud buisines of that nature vnless they should have deferred them for more then a Quarter Court of a year longer, the debate of this was now necessary and beinge long was another occasion of the Court? continuance. And the Contract wth this new Proposition beinge againe confirmed the Offices, Salaries and Officers in respect of obiec?ons and new Propositions then offered and seuerally wayed were againe to be debated and putt to ye question and soe to be either confirmed (as they were) or el? altered and that of necessitie att this time because they expected instantlie the cominge in of great quantitie of Tobacco from Virginia and the Somer Iland?, and another Courte could not have the power to doe itt, And these were the onely and true causes of ye con- tinuance of these Court? this Day so longe. And yt cause wch is intimated by ye Obiec?on is vtterly vntrue, for though ?adventure some de?ted before the rysinge of ye Courte yett not one yt opposed the Conclusionns and former Act? of Courts went away and att the very last besides divers Noblemen, and knights when the question was putt ther were about a hundred personns. Itt hath bin obiected, that in ye time when this Contract was first to be concluded ye Court? were on purpose put of Seauen weekes together, by reason that some Planters that were shortly to goe away might not haue opertunyty to Complaine against itt. 4 Puttinge of of Court? Itt is strange howe any man knowinge our ?ceedings in this buisiness could wth any confidence broach such an obiection beinge so manyfestly impossible and so absolutely falce as shall appeare. Answere. Nothinge tendinge to the Conclusion of the Contract, could be ratified but in a Quarter Courte: The Companies in their last midsomer Quarter Court? did first agree to this bargaine, att wch time, all the old Planters, being aboute thirty in nomber were or might have been in the Courts for none went away till aboute eight week? after. Neither could it be then discouered they were att all discontented wth itt none makinge obiec?on butt some arguinge ernestly for itt, And then the bargaine beinge concluded and soe become vnarguable that the Courts should be afterwards putt of to avoide their Argument cannot be apprehended to agree with sence. Howsoeuer itt is vntrue yt the Courts were att all soe long putt of for all- though by the orders of the Companies in the long vacations there may be a cessation of meetings except vppon extraordinary and pressinge occasionns, yett yt year by reason of sendinge out divers Ships and wth them Direc?ons to Virginia and ye Summer Iland? ye Court? mett more frequently then ?they? vsually had done att any such times hertofore, and for any thinge could appear to the Companies though ther were divers old Virginia Planters heere and 700 new all wch were to goe thither after this conclusion of the Contract yett not one man appeared or shewed himselfe to be greived or discontented therwith. [259] Itt was confidently alledged yt ye Virginia Planters had ernestly desyred of his Matie to bringe all their Tobacco into England and that this Peti- tion was by ye Officers of ye Company supprest. 5 Suppressinge of ye Planters Petition. Noe man that ever sawe this Petition and hath not a mynde willfully to put iniuries vppon the Company could ever force or scrue this sence out of itt, and his will easily apear by the originall Peti?on itt selfe now remayninge in the hand? of ye Lord Treasuror. Answere. Butt the occasion of the Peticon of the Planters was this that by reason ?of? some Monopolizinge the wholl Trade of Tobacco those of Virginia as well as any other were by a Proclamation forbidden to bringe in Tobacco butt vppon such Condi?ons as the Patentees would enforce vppon them wch occasioned this petition onely conteyninge an humble sute to yor Matie: that they might not be restrayned from ventinge of their Comoditie in these Kingdomes and the reason why this Peti?on was not deliuered was, for that before our receivinge of the Peti?on that restrainte by the Proclamation was alredy taken of. To disgrace ye Proceedings of ye Companies they alledge yt no buisi- nes can be done in ye Court? by reason of faction and wranglinge. 6 Faction Itt ?is? an odd thinge for men to Complaine of that wherin themselvs ar prin- cipally faulty: But wth soe generall an extent the Obiection is vntrue for these fower years past the Courts haue been carryed soe peaceably and quyetlie as can hardly be parralelled in any Assembly consistinge of such an nomber. Answere But wth all itt is true yt Divers discontented ?sonns who now have ioyned together in impugninge the Contract have waited for all occasionns to worke disturbance and trouble in the Companies, whose faces for divers years together have not been seen in Courts save onely att such times as when they com to raise a tempest; Butt the causes of their seuerall discontent? and ill affections shall in their due place hereafter more att large appeare. In the meane time §in§ this answere wee will onely observe this that when they have mustered their forces together and sent for their strength out of the Country ther is att the most butt 26: Opposites to the Courts: Wheras ye Vir- ginia Company consists of neer one Thousand ?sonns wherof many times two hundred assemble att once, and the Summer Iland? Company of aboue one hundred and Twenty seuerall Adventurers and many times 70— or 80— assemble att one Courte soe that what soeuer they have alleadged as ffaction in the Companies must needs reflect on them selvs because in all Societies well gouerned the Maior ?t doth invoule the consent of the lesser: wch opposinge make themselvs therby to be the ?ty ffactions. [260] They alleadge that ye Gouerment as it now stands is Democraticall and tumultuous and therfore fitt to be altered and reduced to the hands of some few personns. 7 Vnfitt Gouerment. The Gouerment is no other then by yor Maty: in yor Letters Patent? is pre- scribed vnto vs: And itt is a bold censure thus to taxe a Gouerment ordayned and constituted by such an authority Butt besides, their Allega?on is a slaunder for ye Gouerment is not Democraticall. Answere. ffor first wee have not supreame authoritie ouer the people of the Plantations butt Gouerne them vnder yor Maty by authority deryved from you and accord- ingly to yor lawes as neer as may be, and are accomptable to yor Maty therfore &amp; yt Gouerment cannot be tearmed Democraticall wher the Kinge onely hath absolute power and where the people swear alleagiance onely to him butt is truly Monarchycall. Secondly the Companies are soe farr from havinge absolute power ouer those people that when any of them haue Comitted offences of what high nature soeuer as hath appeared lately by two notorious examples: if hee scape pun- ishmt in ye Planta?ons wher they have power by yor Mats ?res Patents to punish him hee may here out face the Companies as they doe and they have no means of redress butt by appeallinge to higher Iustice. Itt is true that accordinge to yor Mats: Institu?on in their Letters Patent? the Gouerment hath some shew of a Democraticall forme wch is in this case the most iust and most ?fitable and the moste apt means to worke the ends and effect desyred by yor Maty: for ene §for§ the benifitt encrease and wealth of these Planta?ons, by wch the proffitt of yor Maty of ye Aduenturer and Planter will rise together. Most iust because these planta?ons though furthered much by yor Mat'es grace yett beinge not made att yor Mats charge or expence but cheifly by the pryvate purses of the Adventurers they would neuer §have§ Adventured in such an Ac?on wherin they interress their owne fortunes if in the regulatinge and gouerninge of their owne buisines their owne votes had been excluded. And most profitable for ye advanceinge ?of? the Planta?on because of the great supplies wch the necessities of the people there often require and cannott be sent but by the purses of many, who [261] if a few had the managinge of the buisines would and that not wth out reason leave them vnsupplyed: And wheras they cry out against Democracicall and call for Oligarchie they make not ye Gouermt therby either of better forme or more Monarchicall. And to discerne what is the iudgment of a Company if ther be not vnanimity ther is no way but by pluralitie of voyces and if plurallytie of voyces were not ther would scarse att any time in any poynte be vnanimitie in any Assembly, that vnanimitie that is proceedinge for the most ?t from Dispaire of prevaylinge in their pryvate opinions or from shame to Discouer opposi?on to publique good. Butt this obiec?on sufficiently Discouers yt they desire to drawe all things into their owne power to wch end ther hath of late been a conspiracy plotted in the Summer Ilands and vndertaken to be ?secuted here by the Gouernor and Cap- taine Butler who is newly returned wherin hee findes correspondencie here at home by some who have openly professed, that they desire the same. ffor ye Tumultuousness obiected itt is answered vnto before in ye Obiec?on of ffac?on and appears to ?ceed onely from themselves. Hauinge thus given answers to the seeminge most materiall scandalls and impu- tacons hopinge those of lesser consequence when the greater are so manifestly Disproved as before have lefte both their waight and releife, Wee are now to Discouer the true causes though disguised by the Opposers why these 26 so much labour to disgrace ye Gou9ment and in effect to bringe to ruine both the Planta?ons by their secrett whisperings and insinuations and by their continuall vnderhand practises to putt vppon the Companyes those faults wch in the Court? they dare neuer maineteyne, butt quallyfied wth such Distinctions as amount to a Denyall of that wch they have been consious to have spoken in other places to the Companies preiudice. And this yor Maty may be pleased further to vnderstand that though itt be true that of late these 26: haue shuffled and made a great noyse in ye So?er Ilands Court? wher they are allmost a fourth parte of the Company, yett in the Virginia Court? consistinge of a greater nomber they have seldom ventured to offer any disturbance and opposi?on to the proceedings ther. The first Cause of these mens malice proceeds from the ill affection of the Old Officers of the Companies out of whose hands (ye Planta?on haveinge not well thrived vnder them) the Gouerment was necessaryly taken and the prosperitie of the same since appearinge and ye benifitt of that removall implyinge a proofe of their misgoverment hath so much offended them that now they endeavour the better the ?to? couer yt fault by publique disturbances and pryvate prac- tise and confedera?on1 1 Written over the word "considera?on." to hinder the present prosperity and hopefull encrease of ye Planta?onns In ?ticuler for the Planta?on of Virginia how itt declyned then &amp; hath prospered since; wee remitt in this place, to the Declaration of the present State of Virginia. 1 Enuy. Butt this change of the Officers and great change in the State of the Planta?ons hath stirred vpp so much envy in them, as they have not forborne by frequent imputa?ons layd on by themselvs by settinge to their hands in attesta?on of most scandalous and false peti?ons by sometimes ?curinge Complaints againste the Courts [262] and by publique encourragmt and protec?on of personns declared enimies to the Companies to bringe the present managinge of the Plantacons into confusion and disgrace. The Second cause is that the principall of those §Cittizens§ and some others that weaue themselvs into this opposi?on party wch are butt few are for the most ?t such as haue heretofore borne office in one or both of ye Companies either here or in the Planta?ons who haueinge not cleered their many Accompts some of wch are verie susspicious and beinge prest by the Companies to Accompt doe vse all the Arte that mallice cann invent to doe preiudice §to§ &amp; cause disturbance in the present Gouerment; by yt means to shroud themselvs from a due and quyett examyna?on, and soe in the storme and confusion to goe away as by this means hetherto they have donne vndiscouered. 2 Declyninge of be- inge called to an Accompt Thirdly some other of these Opponents and of other rancke have had their hand ?tlie in spoylinge the Planta?on of Virginia and settinge out a Ship called the Treasurer for robbinge into the West Indies and ?tlie in abettinge and protectinge those yt have soe done and that wth vyolence to the great offence scandall &amp; losse of the Company and their ends not fully answeringe their hopes hath caused them to abandon the Court? for Virginia save onely in poynte ?curinge their trouble by that means to keep the Company from leas- ure to call such offences into question. 3 ffeare of beinge Called into questiõ for destroyinge of ye Planta?on And itt is very apparant yt whosoeuer is an enymie or hath done wronge to ye Company hath recourse to and is ?tected by some of these Opponents. And in this manner for these causes wch may be fixed vppon most of the 26: those fewe yt remayne are either Servants or have necessary dependencie vppon some of ye rest. 5 Dependancy. Butt these ?sonns by this opposi?on have sufficiently declared their want of care for the good of the Planta?ons in yt haveinge indeauored to ouerthrowe the Contract wch by the matter of Sole importa?on must needs have been of inestimable Comforte to both the Planta?ons by ventinge of yt one Comodity of Tobacco to the value of att least one hundred Thousand pounds a year have yett to this Day insteed therof offered no new proposi?on for ye good of the Planta?ons butt rest onely content wth distroyinge of yt wch was before estab- lished. Butt if itt would please yor most sacred Maty: seeings that the principall ends of the Companies in followinge the buisines of these Planta?ons are for ye honour of yor Mats times (3) §in propagating of Christian Religiõ in those Barbarous ?ts§1 1 Inserted in the margin and referred to by a (3).

The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Company, that himselfe and the rest had deliuered the Companies peti?on, together wth ye Declara?on and Relation ordered by the Last Court vnto his Maty who referred [265] it vnto ye Lord? of the Priuy Counsell, before whome himselfe and diuers of the Company had beene that morning, and by their order caused this Court to be warned, to consider of Letters to be written to both the Planta?ons by ye seuerall Companies. Wch ?res his Lop sayd, it was the ?s pleasure should not make any manner of men?on of any dissen?on and disturbanc? here at home, whereby ye Planta?ons might be putt into any feare or discomfort; but contra- rily should be assured of not onely ye continuance, but increase of the Royall fauour of his Matie toward? them. And further his Lop acquainted them, that the Lord? comaunded him to signify and giue warninge in the Court to all perticuler members of the Companie, that none of them should vpon their alleagiance dare to write any thing to either of the Planta?ons concerninge matters of diuision or differenc? that had passed here at home, or any thing that might dishearten them or giue them discouragemt or any thing contrary to the Publi? Letters; and if they had allready written, that they should recall their ?res. Herevpon the Court after some delibera?on agreed vpon certaine generall heades of Letters; according wherevnto mr Deputy was entreated to drawe vp ye ?res against too morrowe in the afternoone, when the Court? would meete about that busines only. Sr Nathaniell Rich propounded, that accordingly as he had in ye Court of the ?second of Aprill? moued the Companies would peti?on for the Sole Importa?on of Tobacco, except only 40000 weight of Spanish Tobacco to be yearely brought in; wch he said there was hope might be obteyned. Wch Proposi?on the former Court did not agree vnto, in reguard that they conceaued, that it was ye inten?on of ye State so to stint forraigne Tobaccoes, that noe more then 40000 weight of Spanish Tobacco should be brought in yearely; and there- vpon it was not conceaued any waies preiudiciall to them, though the 40000 weight were brought in by others. But now ye Companie being giuen to vnderstand, that there was likely to be a free importa?on of all sort? of forraigne Tobacco wthout stint, and that there was a Proclama?on shortly to come forth to that pur- pose, wch formely they did not expect nor imagine; it was vnani- mously adiudged, that that would be the vtter ouerthrowe of ye Planta?ons, for that thereby the Tobacco would be brought downe to nothing. Wherevpon it was generally thought most necessary, to seeke and indeauour by all possible meanes to prevent this free importa?on; and since it could not be hoped to obtayne an absolute restreint, yet at least to peti?on his Matie and the Lo: Treasuror that it might be limited to 40000 weight, and that in lieu of this limitacoñ, they would willingly here agree and binde themselues to bring in [266] all their Tobaccoes hither, and doe their best to persuade the Colonie to doe the Like; Wherevpon the order following being propounded, was by erec?on of hand? agreed vnto; A free Importation the utter ouerthrow of the Plantations1 1 This marginal entry is in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar.

[267] The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Company, that the Comittee appointed by the last Court, hauing had some conference wth the Lo: Treasuror about that Proposition &amp; request, wch the sayd Crt was desired might be made to his Lop in ye name of ye Companies, viztt That he would be a meanes to his Matie, that they may haue the Sole Importa?on of Tobacco into England, wth ye excep?on only of 40000 weight of Spanish Tobacco. Wch Proposition and Request his Lop hauing read (being deliuered vnto him as it is sett downe in ye former Court) sayd, he would acquaynt ye king therewith, and they should receaue an answere wthin few dayes, His Lop professing he bore that Loue vnto ye Planta?ons, that although he was the Kings mats publi? Officer; yet he would be contented to decline somewhat from his Mats profitt for ye good of ye Planta?ons. And being further moued, that his Lop would vouchsafe to be a meanes for ye 400 young persons formerly ?mised to be sent to Virginia; His Lop seemed well disposed to forward that suite, whensoeuer the Company should peti?on for them. Herevpon it was moued by some, that it might now be taken into considera?on, whither it were not fitt to peti?on the Lord? for ye sayd 400 persons; But it was rather thought fitt to respite ye same awhile, vntill they may be better informed of the State of the Country and Collony in Virginia, &amp; whither ye Aire there be soe vnholesome &amp; vnhealthfull for people to liue in; as hath beene of late confidently reported to his Matie. It being now allmost ffiue a clock, it was vpon mo?on generally agreed &amp; ordered by either Company, that both Court? should be continued till businesses were ended. Mr Deputy being entreated by the Last Virginia &amp; Sumer Ilandes Court to drawe vp the publi? Letters according to those generall head?, wch were then agreed on did now present the same to be read.

[269] The Court held the Second of this moneth was now read, whereat noe man taking excep?on, it was putt to ye question, and by a gen9 all erec- ?on of hand? (noe one dissenting) confirmed to be rightly sett downe. The Court also of the Twelueth of ye same moneth was read and by a generall erec?on of hand? confirmed. The Court Likewise of ye Eighteenth of this moneth was read, &amp; by a generall erec?on of hand? approued &amp; confirmed. Vpon notice giuen of the Ann's departure from Grauesend notwith- standing the ?os of the Counsells order to Sr Iohn Wolstenholme to stay her till further direc?on. It was informed by mr Woodall and mr Dennis shee was safe at Portesmouth, and that they were assured shee went not to ye Su?er Ilandes as was supposed. Sr Iohn Brooke, mr White and mr Ditchfield were by this Court desired to goe too morrow morning to ye Lo: Treasuror in ye Companies name humbly to desire ye continuance of his Lops fauour for the attayning of the Companies suite, that there be noe more then 40000 weight of Spanish Tobacco to be brought in yearely; And further to acquaynt his Lop wth ye great damage &amp; inconvenience that ariseth to the poore Passengers that lye at the Isle of Wight by delay of ye Shipp; And humbly therefore to beseech his Lop, that the lls ?re may be expedited, that accordingly the Shipp may be dispatched. And further humbly to acquaynt his Lop, that concerning those addi?ons required in Mr Dickensons ?re; that although they doe not knowe of any diuision or distraction in the Colonies, yet in obedience to his Lops comaund they will add a clause to that effect, And for certefying them of the course appointed by his Matie for their good, and redresse of all inconven- iences, they will send their llps order, if his Lop soe please. But for the §Two§ first point? to signifie vnto them, that ye Contract is dis- solued, and that there must be a free Importa?on, they conceaue that the Last point wilbe the most discomfortable newes vnto ye Colonies, that possibly cann be; It being generally adiudged in their Court?, and confessed by them that haue most opposed the Contract, that if there be a free Importa?on of Tobacco, and yet the Colonies bound to bring in all, that their Tobacco will come to iust nothing, and that the Planta?ons wilbe vtterly ruyned. Wherefore the Companies most humbly desire, they may not be pressed to signify or say any thing concerning the breach of ye Contract, except they may giue assurance of this new fauour for wch they are Suitors. They are humbly also to desire his Lop that the order may be explayned and sett downe concerning the not sending any [270] ?res, the Com- pany conceauing that at Counsell table, the ?s did not only forbidd them to write any Letters touching any contentious busines here at home: But that they did absolutely giue them Leaue to write con- cerning their perticuler and priuate affaires, wch wth out aduise by Let- ters, would suffer much damage &amp; preiudice, and be a cause of infinite griefe and discontent to ye Colonie to receaue noe ?res from them. The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Court, that whereas a Petition was deliuered to his Maty by mr Ald?an Iohnson, as also an Imforma?on by Capt Butler termed by him The Vnmasked face of our Colonie in Virginia, wch was the occasion the Company likewise presented to his Matie their Two writings, viztt the Declaracon, &amp; Relation, together wth a Petition, Ioyning therein wth mr Alderman in ye issue of his Petition, namely yt ye examina?on &amp; rectefying of ye matters com- pleyned of might be referred to ye ?s of the Counsell. Wch peti?on of mr Ald?an and his Associat? and Informa?on of Capt Butler being now sent vnto ye Com?., his Lop propounded they might be read, and afterward? some course thought on for preparing of matters in answere therevnto against ye sitting of ye Comissionrs. Wherevpon mr Alderman ?Iohnson? peti?on was first read, being as followeth To ye Kings most excellent Maty:1 1 This petition is entered in the handwriting of Thomas Collett(?). It is referred to in List of Records, No. 445, Vol. I, page 168, ante. The humble Petition of Sundry the Aduenturers and Planters of the Virginia and Su?er Ilands Planta?ons ?Most graceous Soueraigne? Amongst the many memorable works of yor Mats: gratious Raigne those of the Planta?ons of Virginia and the So?er Ilands are not the least, The begininge of wch enterprize beinge the first fforraigne Colony planted by our nation accompanyed wth soe great a charge to furnish Ships and men and to make yearly new Supplies wthout any present hope of retribu?on, was sufficient att the first veiwe and computa?on to haue discourraged ye most resolute and for- ward Adventurers butt by Gods Assistance and yor Mats: gracious encourrag- mts wth that discreet and mylde Gouermt first nomynated and appoynted by yor Matie All sorts of men were in such kindely and frendly manner invited to engage themselves yt notwthstandinge many difficulties that great Ac?on (wch otherwise had perished in the birth) not onely tooke life and beinge butt ?ceeded in a moste hopefull and comfortable Course for many years togeather wth vnity and love amongst ourselvs, &amp; quyett enterteynmt of those Sauadg Indians by wch endeavours sundry of those Infidells and some of emynent sort were converted to Christian Religion, Staple Comodities began to be raysed and imported into this kingdome, as Iron, Sturgion, Caueary, Sope and Pott- ashes, Masts for Ships, Clapbourd Pipestaues Waynscott, Wine, Pitch, and Tarr and yt most desyred worke of Silkwormes: These were ye blessings then vppon our peaceable proceedinge. Butt wee know not howe itt is of late years com to passe that notwthstandinge yor Maties Subiects haue been in great multitude exported to the Planta?ons yett ye aforesaid Comodities and other ye fruits of yt worke doe not appear as in former times or vnitie and peace att home is turned to Civill discord and dissen?on amongst orselvs and to Massacre and Hostility between ye Natives and our Colony in Virginia, and divers of ye Antient Adventurers and Planters conceive themselvs many wayes iniured abused and oppressed In wch respect fearinge yt ye vtter ruyne and distruc?on of those great works is like to fol- lowe wthout the help of a supreame hand, and not holdinge itt fitt to trouble yor sacred ears wth ?ticularr Complaints, wee are forced for remedy to appeale to yor moste excellent maty: Humbly prayinge yt some worthy personages whom yor Maty: shall please may be nõiated and appointed by yr Co?ission vnder ye great Seale of England who by Oath or otherwise by all lawfull means and waies may enquire and examine ye true estate of ye Planta?ons att ye time when Sr Thomas Smith lefte ye Gouerment of ye said Compa: and all incidents thervnto belonginge, as allso what monneys since yt time haue been collected for ye Planta?ons and by whome how ye same haue been procured &amp; expended [271] and what after ye expence of somuch monny is ye true estate &amp; Condi?on of ye said Planta- ?ons at this time present: As allso to enquire into all abuses and greivances concerninge the former ?ticularrs And of all wrongs and iniuries done to any the Adventurers or Planters and the grounds and causes therof, and to pro- pound how the same may in time to come be reformed and howe the buisi- nesses of ye said Planta?ons may be better mannaged Soe that all Contentions and difficulties being reconciled the Authors therof condignely punished vnitie and peace resettled, and ye forme of Gouerninge and Dyrectinge these Affaires beinge better established, that worke may pros? wth a blessinge from heaven to yor Mats great honour and proffitt and to those religious and publique ends for wch they were first vndertaken. Next was read Captaine Butlers dismasking of Virginia being as fol- loweth. The Vnmasked face of or Colony in Virginia as it was in the Winter of ye yeare 16221 1 This document is in the Public Record Office, State Papers, Colonial, Vol. II, No. 20, I. For fuller citation see List of Records, No. 388, Vol. I, page 162, ante. It is inserted in the handwriting of Thomas Collett (?). I found the Planta?ons generally seated vppon meer Salt Marishes full of infectious Boggs and muddy Creeks and Lakes, and therby subiected to all those Inconvenyencies and diseases, wch are soe co?ly found in the most vnsound and most vnhealthie partes of England, wherof every Country and Clymate hath some. I found the shores and sides of those ?ts of the mayne River wher our Planta- ?ons are settled every wher soe shallow as no Boate can approach the Shores Soe that besides the difficulty daunger and spoyle of goods in ye Landinge of them, the ?poore? people are forced to a continuall wadinge and wettinge of themselvs and that in the prime of winter when the Ships commonly arrive &amp; therby gett such vyolent surfeits of Cold vppon Cold, as seldome leave them vntill they leaue to live. The new people yt are yearly sent ouer wch arrive here for the most parte verie vnseasonably in winter finde neither Guesthouse Inn nor any the like place to shroud themselvs in att their Arrivall no not so much as a stroake given towards any such charitable worke soe that many of them by want herof are not onely seen dyinge vnder hedges and in the woods, but beinge dead ly some of them for many dayes vnregarded and vnburied. The Colony was this winter in much distress of victuall soe that English meale was sould att the rate of Thirty shillings a bushell their owne native Corne called Maize att Tenn and fifteen shillings the bušhell, the wch howsoeuer itt lay heavy vppon the shoulders of the Generallytie itt may be suspected not to be vnaffected by some of the cheife; for they onely haueinge the means in these extremities to Trade for Corne wth the Natives doe hereby engrosse all into their hands and soe sell itt abroad att their owne prizes and myselfe have heard from the mouth of a prime one amongst them that hee would never wish that their owne Corne should be cheaper amongst them then eight shillings the bushell. Their howses are generally the worste that ever I sawe the meanest Cottages in England beinge every way equall (if not superiour) wth the moste of the best. And besides soe improvidently and scatteringlie are they built seated one from an other as ?tly by their distance butt especially by ye interposi?ons of Creeks and Swamps as they call them, they offer all advantages to their Sauadge enymies and are vtterly depryved of all suddaine recollec?on of them selves vppon any termes whatsoever. I found not the least peec of ffortifica?on: Three peeces of Ordinance onely mounted att Iames Citty and one att fflowerdue hundred butt never a one of them serviceable; Soe yt itt is most certaine that a Small Barke of 100 Tunn may take itts time to pass vpp the River in spite of them; &amp; co?inge to an Anchor before ye Towne may beat all their houses downe aboute their ears and soe forceinge them to retreat into the woods may Land vnder ye fauour of their Ordinance and rifle the Towne att pleasure. [272] Expectinge accordinge to their printed bookes a great forwardnes of divers and sundry Comodities att myne aryvall I found not any one of them soe much as in any towardnes of beinge for the Iron-works were vtterlie vasted and the men dead the ffurnaces for Glasse and Potts att a stay and in small hope; As for the rest they were had in a generall derision even amongst themselvs &amp; the Pamphelts yt had published their beinge sent thither by hun- dreds were laughed to scorne and every base fellow boldly gave them the lye in divers ?ticulers Soe yt Tobacco onely was ye buisines and for ought that I could here every man madded vppon that and little thought or looked for any thinge ellse. I found ye Antient Planta?ons of Henrico and Charles Citty wholly quitted and lefte to ye spoyle of the Indians who not onely burned the houses said to be once ye best of all others, butt fell vppon the Poultry, Hoggs, Cowes, Goats and Horses wherof they killed great nombers to ye great greife aswell as ruyne of ye Olde Inhabitants whoe stick not to affirme that these were not onely the best and healthiest parts of all others butt might allso by their naturall strength of scitua?on haue been the most easefully ?served of all others. Wheras accordinge to his Mats: gratious ?res Patents his people in Virginia are as neer as possibly may be to be gouerned after the excellent Lawes and Customes of England; I found in ye Gouermt there not only ignorant &amp; enforced strayings in divers ?ticularrs butt willfull &amp; intended ones In soe much as some who vrged due conformitie haue in contempt been termed men of Lawe, and were excluded from those rights wch by orderlie ?ceedinge they were elected and sworne vnto here. There haveinge been as itt is thought not fewer then Tenn thousand soules transported thether there are not through the aforenamed abuses and neglects aboue Two thousand of them att the present to be found alive many of them allso in a sickly and des?ate estate: Soe that itt may vndoubtedly be expected that vnless the confusions and pryvate ends of some of ye Company here and ye badd execu?ons in secondinge them by their Agents there be redressed wth spede by some divine and supreame hand yt in steed of a Planta?on itt will shortly gett ye name of a slaughter house and soe iustly becom both odious to our selvs &amp; contemptible to all the world. Which being read, it was thought fitt for satisfac?on of such as seemed to be much discouraged wth this his confident report touching the vnhealthines of ye Country, and ill seating of ye Colony in Virginia (it being by some persons of worth informed that vpon this Informa- ?on there was like to be a stay of many hundred? that were preparing to transporte themselues) to heare the reports of such as had beene long and often in Virginia. Wherevpon diuers being nowe present in Court, were asked perticulerly; who affirmed vpon their certen knowl- edge, that at euery Planta?on by and neere about that riuer, they may Land wth Boats drawing Three foote water from halfe floud to halfe ebbe safe &amp; dry wthout wetting their foote. And further that they finde by their owne experience, the Aire there as wholesome, and the soyle for ye most part as fertille as in any place in England, or in any Country wheresoeuer they haue trauelled. But for further preparing of the answeres aswell to this Informa?on, as also to ye peti?on of Alderman Iohnson &amp; his Associat?, and like- wise for giuing ye charge &amp; makinge [273] the remonstrance of the proceedings of ye former yeares and of those later foure yeares, wch y Company were to defend; It was resolued that since it would be too teadious, and impossible to passe these things in publi? Courts, that it should be done by way of Comittees: But because the part? of these buisinesses were very many, and therefore needed ye helpe of many head?; and considering that it was ye defence &amp; vpholding of ye whole Company, and euery man had interest therein one way or other, It was therefore ordered, by erec?on of hand?, that there should be first a great Comittee of the whole Company in generall, whence noe man (free of the Court) should be excluded, but only these who by ye deliuery of ye peti?on &amp; Informa?on, had made themselues ye Com- panies Accusers; wch since they still mayntayned, it was not any way reasonable, that they should be at ye meetings &amp; consulta?ons of the Company, when they were to prepare their owne defenc?, or giue these Opposers their charge; To wch diuers of them being present, and in perticuler Alderman Iohnson being present did agree, saying, that they did not desire to be present at any of ye meetings of the Company to this purpose; &amp; therevpon himselfe &amp; diuers others departed ye Court. It was likewise further ordered, that there should be chosen one to moderate businesses in this great Comittee, &amp; it was thought fitt, that in reguared the meetings were like to be many and Long, that he should haue an Assistant to helpe him, and to supply ?his? ye place vpon occasion of his absence. It was also ordered, that this great Comittee should haue power to substitute &amp; ordayne Sub Comittees for ye expediting of perticuler businesses, that by ye parting of things among them, they might be ye speedier and better accomplished: and that these Sub Comittees should bring their labours &amp; endeauors to the great Comittee, &amp; being by them approued should be presented vnto ye Generall Court: It was likewise ordered by erec?on of hand?, that for these businesses the Counsell might assemble themselues, excluding those from their sayd meetings, who being of ye Counsell had ioyned wth Ald?an Iohnson in accusing ye Gouernemt &amp; Proceed- ings of the Company these ffoure Last yeares.</field>

[275] The Lo: Cauendish acquainted the Company, that diuers ancient Planters, mrs of Shipps, Marriners, and sundry other persons that haue Liued Long in Virginia, and haue beene many tymes there, had presented ye great Comittee wth an answere vnto Capt Butlers Infor- ma?on, concerning the Colony in Virginia; wherein they did directly contrary the most mayne point? of his Informa?on, prouing them to be false and scandalous; wch was by erec?on of hand? ordered to be read, being this wch followeth. The Answers of diuers Planters that haue long liued in Virginia as alsoe of sundry Marriners and other persons yt haue bene often at Virginia vnto a paper intituled The Vnmasked face of our Colony in Virginia as it was in ye Winter of ye yeare—16221 1 This document is in the handwriting of Nicholas Ferrar's assistant, Thomas Collett (?). 1: I founde the Planta?ons generally seated vppon meere Salt marishes full of infectious Boggs and muddy Creekes, and Lakes, &amp; therby sub- iected to all those inconveniences and diseases which are soe co?only found in ye moste Vnsounde &amp; most Vnhealthy parts of England wherof euerie Country &amp; Clymate hath some. 1: Wee say that there is no place inhabited but is conveniently habitable. And for ye first Planta?on wch is Kiccoutan against wch (if any be) most exception may be made, itt is every way soe well disposed that in that place well gou- erned men may enioy their healths and live as plentifully as in any parte of England or other his Maties: Dominions, yett that there are Marishes in some places wee acknowledge; Butt soe as they are more Comodious for divers good respects and vses then if they were wantinge. As for Boggs wee knowe of none in all ye Country and for the rest of the Planta?ons as Newports News, Blunt poynt Wariscoyake Martins Hundred, Paspahey and all the Plantacons right ouer against Iames Citty, and all the Planta?ons aboue these wch are many they are verie fruitfull and pleasant Seates, free from Salt Marishes beinge all on the fresh River and they are all verie healthfull and high Land except Iames Citty wch is yett as high as Debtforde or Radclyffe. Answere. 2 I founde ye shores and sides of those part? of ye Mayne Riuer wher our Planta?ons are setled euery wher soe shallow as noe Boates can approach ye shores soe yt besides ye difficulty daunger and spoile of goods in ye Landinge of them, ye people are forced to a Continuall wadinge &amp; wettinge of themselues and yt in ye prime of winter when ye Shipps co?only arriue, and therby gett such vyolent surfetts of colde vppon colde as seldome leaue them vntill they leaue to liue. 2 That generally for the Planta?ons att all times from halfe ffloud to halfe ebb any Boate yt drawes betwixt three and 4 foote water may safely com in &amp; Land their Goods dry on Shore wthout wadinge &amp; for further Cleeringe of these ?this? false obieccons the Seamen there doe att all times deliuer the goods they bringe to the Owners dry on Shore, wherby itt plainely appears not any of ye Country people there inhabitinge are by this means in daunger of their lives, ?And? at a great many of Planta?ons belowe Iames Citty and allmost all aboue they may att all times Land dry. Answere. 3 The new people yt are yearly sent ouer which arriue here for ye most part very Vnseasonably in Winter, finde neither Guest house Inne, nor any ye like place to shroud themselues in at their arriuall, noe not soe much as a stroake giuen towards any such charitable worke soe yt many of them by want hereof are not onely seen dyinge vnder hedges &amp; in the woods but beinge dead ly some of them for many dayes Vnregarded &amp; Vnburied. 3 To ye first they Answere that the winter is the most healthfull time &amp; season for arrivall of new Co?ers True itt is yt as yett theris noe Guesthouse or place of interteynmt of ?for? Strangers. Butt wee averr yt itt was a late intent and had by this time been putt in practise to make a generall gatheringe for the buildinge of such a Convenient house wch by this time had been in good forwardnes had itt not pleased God to suffer this Disaster to fall out by the Indians. But although there be no publique Guesthouse yett are new Commers entertayned and lodged &amp; ?vided for by ye Gouernor in pryvate houses; And for any dyinge in the feilds (through this defecte) &amp; lyinge vnburied, wee are altogether ignorant, yett yt many dy suddenly by ye hand of God, wee often see itt to fall out euen in this flourishinge &amp; plentifull Citty in ye middest of our streets, as for dyinge vnder hedges theris noe hedge in all Virginia. [276] Answer: 4 The Colony was this winter in much distress of victuall soe that English meale was soulde at ye rate of thirtie shillings a bushell their owne natiue Corne called Maize at ten and fifteen shillings the bushell, The wch howsoeuer itt lay heauy vppon ye shoulders of ye Generallytie it may be suspected not to be vnaffected by some of ye cheife, for they only haueinge the means in these extremities to trade for Corne with ye Natiues doe herby ingrosse ?all? into their hands and soe sell yt abrode at their owne prices, &amp; my selfe haue heard from the mouth of a prime one amongst them yt hee would neuer wish yt their owne Corne should be cheaper among them then eight shillings the bushell. 4 True itt is yt English meale hath of late since the Massacre been sould for Tenn pounds of Tobacco ye bushell wch no vnderstandinge man can there value aboue fifteen shillings sterlinge and here wee finde (wthout a Massacre) by the iudgment of God for our murringe §murmuringe§ att plentie Wheat hath this yeare been sould and still is in many places at three times the rate itt hath borne wthin two or three years last past: And againe Indian Corne hath heretofore comonly been sould after the rate of five shillings the bushell, And farther meale bore so high a price this year as itt cost redy mony in Eng- land together wth the fraight &amp; other charges neer vppon twelue shilling? soe yt if itt were sould att Tenn pounds of Tobacco ther will not be gayned twenty in the hundred. Answere. 5 Ther Howses are generally the worst yt euer I sawe ye meanest Cot- tages in England beinge euery way equall (if not superior) with ye moste of the best, And besides soe improuidently and scattringly are they seated one from an other as partly by their distance but especially by the interposi?on of Creeks and Swamps as they call them they offer all aduantages to their sauadge enimys &amp; are vtterly depriued of all suddaine recollection of themselues vppon any tearmes whatsoeuer. 5. ffirst that the houses there were most built for vse and not for ornament and are soe farr from beinge soe meane as they are reported yt throughout his Mats: Dominions here, all labouringe mens houses (wch wee cheifly ?fesse our selvs to be) are in no wise generally for goodnes to be compared vnto them And for the houses of men of better Ranke and quallety they are soe much better and convenyent yt noe man of quallety wthout blushinge can make excep?on against them; Againe for the Creeks and Swamps every man ther that cannott goe by Land hath either a Boate or a Conoa for ye Conveyinge &amp; speedy passage to his neighbors house. As for Cottages ther are none in Vir- ginia that they knowe. Answere 6 I found not ye least peec of ffortification, Three Peeces of Ordinance onely mounted at Iames Citty and one at fflowerdue Hundred but neuer a one of them seruiceable Soe that itt is most certaine yt a smale Barke of one hundred Tunns may take its time to pass vp the Riuer in spite of them &amp; co?inge to an Anchor before the Towne may beate all their houses downe aboute their eares, &amp; so forceinge them to retreat into ye Woods may land vnder ye fauour of their Ordinance, &amp; rifle ye Towne at pleasure. 6 Itt is true theris as yett no other artificiall ffortifica?ons then Pallisadoes wherof allmoste everie Planta?on hath one, &amp; divers of them hath Trenches, And this last yeare Capt Eache was sent for yt purpose As for great Ordi- nance there are fower peeces mounted att Iames Citty and all serviceable, ther are six Mounted att fflowerdue hundred all of them likewise serviceable, And three mounted att Kiccoutan and all of them serviceable, there are likewise att Newporte Newes three all of them serviceable ther are likewise att Henrico seaven peeces and att Charles hundred two, and in other places, besides ffowlers and Murders att divers places. Answere 7 Expectinge accordinge to their printed Bookes a great forwardnes of diuers &amp; sundry Comodities, At myne arriuall I found not any one of them so much as in any towardnes of being ffor ye Iron workes were vtterly vasted, &amp; ye men dead, The ffurnaces for Glass and Pots at a stay, &amp; in a smale hope, As for ye rest they were had in a generall derision euen amongst themselues, and ye Pamphlets yt had published there beinge sent thither by Hundreds wer laughed to scorne, and euery base fellow boldly gaue them ye Lye in diuers perticulers, Soe that Tobacco onely was ye buisines &amp; for ought yt I coulde here euery man madded vppon yt and lyttle thought or looked for else any thinge else. 7 That ye Country yeilds divers vsefull &amp; rich Co?odities wch by reason of ye Infancie of ye Planta?on, and this vnexpected Massacre, cannot yett be brought to ?feccon, &amp; is no lesse hindred by ye emulous and envious reports of ill willers whose pryvate ends by time wilbe discoured and by God recom- penced. And wee doe further answer yt this Country is a moste fruitfull Country, &amp; doth certainly ?duce divers rich Comodities.

There was likewise read the attesta?on of one Iohn Seuerne and one Iohn Lowe, being as followeth.1 1 These attestations are entered in the handwriting of Thomas Collett (?). Iohn Seuerne Maisters mate of the Iames affirmeth, that cominge one morninge to Captaine ?Natha?

This 28 of Aprill—1623. Iohn Seuerne. Iohn Lowe Boatswaine of the Iames cominge alonge wth Iohn Seuerne to Capt: Butler sett his hand likewise to the writinge esteeminge Capt Butler to be a verie worthy gentleman and heard not but a few lines onely of ye said writinge read wthout markinge itt, butt now hee vnderstandinge yt itt was a writinge in Disgrace of the Country hee Disauoweth his said handwritinge, and protest- eth that vppon his Oath hee must say the contrary. This 28: of Aprill 1623. Iohn Lowe. It being moued that Capt Butler might haue a copie of this Answere deliuered him, the Court by erec?on of hand? denyed it, vntill such time as the Comissionrs sitting, it might be first presented vnto them. After this was read the Letter written to the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia, being the selfe same in all point? wth that wch had beene confirmed in Two former Court?, except an addi?on signifying the breach of ye Contract directly according to their Lops comaund.2 2 The Order in Council disallowing these former letters is referred to in List of Records, No. 476, Vol. I, page 171, ante. Whereas it was signifyed, that the Lo: Treasuror out of his noble respect and fauour vnto the Companies made offer, that they should haue ye farming of ye 40000 wtt of Spanish Tobacco at ye rent of Six thousand pound? ? Añu. for Two, Three or more yeares, as them- selues should thinke good: It was after Long debate adiudged impossi- ble for the Generall Companies (hauing noe Stock) to vndertake the same. Wherevpon diuers Proposi?ons were made, some supposing it might be done wth Loane mony, if men would lend the Company some mony for a yeare Gratis; And to this end the Earle of Warwick offered to Lend One hundred pound?, Sr Nathaniell Rich One hundred pound?; mr Ditchfield ffiftie pound?, &amp; mr Woodall ffiue &amp; Twenty pound?. Mr Caning likewise made a Proposition, that a Booke might be drawne wth a Preamble for men to vnderwrite what somes they will aduenture toward? a Ioint stock for bringing in the aforesayd quantity of 40000 wtt, he supposing that—8000li—would manage [280] the busines. And in reguared for ye better reputa?on of this busines, it would be neces- sary to haue ye aid and assistance of the Companies, the Vndertakers out of their cleere gaynes should giue the Company a fourth part. Wch Proposition was generally well approued of, if it could be effected, and thought fitt to be referred to a Comittee to consider thereof; as also to consider of all other wayes, how ye farming of this 40000 wtt might be soe vndertaken as ye same might beneficiall vnto ye Com- panies. Wherevpon ye Court nominated for ye Comittee these follow- ing viztt Ea: of Warwick. Ald?an Iohnson. mr Wilmer. Lo: D'Lawarr. mr Gibbs. Cap: Butler.

Vpon mo?on order was giuen for Drawing Vp Two Comissions, the one at the request of mr Bennett for his shipp called the Godsguift being to transport Passengers to Virginia, and the other Comission at ye request of mr Thomas Shiers &amp; his Associat? for the William &amp; Thomas for transporting of Passengers to their owne Planta?on. Wch Comissions were ordered to be drawne vp &amp; sealed. Mr Deputy propounded the passing of three shares from mr Scott to mr Thomas Culpepper of ye Middle Temple London Es?, that if noe excep?on be taken hereat, betweene this &amp; ye next Court he may be admitted. Vpon the humble request of Iames Dauies, the Court hath ordered that vpon proofe made, that he is ye imediate heire to his deees deceased vnckle Walter Dauies, his peti?on shalbe recomended to the Gouernour &amp; Counsell of Virginia, that he may haue the possession of that estate, that is befallen him there by the death of his said vnckle, wth this Caution that if ye Peticonr hath any Brothers or Sis- ters Liuing, they shall haue their part? in ye Good? according to lawe.</field>

The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Court, that after the dissolu?on of ye Contract, when the Companies supposed all things quiett, there was by Alderman Iohnson &amp; those others, that had opposed the Con- tract deliuered vnto his Matie a very bitter &amp; grievous peti?on against ye Gouernemt &amp; carriage of ye Company these ffoure Last yeares. And at ye same tyme Capt Butler likewise presented to his Matie a Declaracon of the State of Virginia, wch he tearmed the Vnmaskinge of ye Colony: wch Two things his Lop said, had beene ye cause of much trouble &amp; Labour in ye Company. And therevpon his Lop briefly acquaynted the Court, what had passed herevpon both wth his Matie &amp; ye LLs of ye Priuy Counsell, as also in ye Court? and Comit- tees. Wherevpon ye Court generally desired that all ye writings and answeres might be read, to the intent that things might be fully &amp; perfectly vnderstood &amp; receaue either addi?on or amendmt as cause should be. Wherevpon was read 1.The peti?on deliuered to his Matie by Ald?an Iohnson and his Associat?. 2.Then ye Informa?on deliuered to his Matie by Capt Butler termed by him ye Vnmaskinge of ye Colonie in Virginia. 3.Then the Companies peti?on to his Matie touching ye issue of Ald?an Iohnsons peti?on for a Comission of enquiry &amp; examina?on. 4.Then the Companies Declara?on of ye present State of Virginia deliuered to his Matie. [283] 5.Then the Relation of ye Companies proceedings in their Court? deliuered likewise to his Matie. 6.Then ye Companies Answere to Ald?an Iohnsons peti?on, being as followeth viztt An answere to a Petition deliuered to his Matie by Alderman Iohnson in the names of sundry Aduenturers and Planters of Virginia and Su?er Ilands Planta?ons.1 1 This answer to the petition, barring the caption, is in the autograph of Thomas Collett (?). The ground worke of ye peti?on is founded vpon a Threefould information. The ffirst that in the former Gouermt of the Companies (vizt) vnder Sr Thomas Smith as Gouernor, and mr Canning and himselfe as Deputies for soe hee intendeth the Gouermt was discreet &amp; milde, wherby all sortes of men were envyted to engage themselvs in that great and difficult Action wch therby ?ceeded in a most hopefull and comfortable course wth vnitie and love Con- trarywise they know not how itt is of late years com to pass yt vnitie and peace here att home is turned to Civill discord and Dis?ention and divers of the Antient Adventurers and Planters conceive themselvs many waies iniured abused and oppressed. Whervnto is answered that this Informa?on is §in both ?ts§ most vntrue, for although his Matie by his gracious letters Pattents hath given authorytie to the said Compa: to make Lawes and orders aswell for the well gouermt of the Companies here att home as allso for §of§ the Colonies abrode, wth direccon therin the §to§ followe the forme of Gouerment Lawes and pollycie of this Realme of England as neer as may be; Yett all those Twelue years therwas no care taken for the bringinge of the same to the intended &amp; desyred effect: ffor first of all his Maties: ?ticularr Instruc?ons for Gouermt: were cleane supprest and extinguished, and the Originall nowe not extant noe orders were made for the Gouerment of the Company here vnless now and then one, vppon present Occasion. And as for ye Gouerment abrode in the Planta?ons itt was for the most ?t lefte to the Gouernors absolute pleasure and power onely insteed of a bodie of moderate Lawes agreeable to the Gouerment in this Realme; there was printed here &amp; wth great honor Dedicated to Sr Thomas Smith &amp; after- ward? sent by him to Virginia wthout the Companies Consent a Booke of most Tyrannycall Lawes written in blood wch although they might serve for Marshall Gouermt in time of Warr beinge translated as they were most of them from the §martiall§ Lawes of ye vnited Provinces; Yett was the same farr from ye Milde Gouerment Comended here by the Peti?oners and both att home deterred all men from goinge in ?son to live there vnder such Truculent Lawes and in Virginia were the cause of the vniust and vndeserved death of sundry of his Mats: subiects, And moreouer putt such a weapon into the hand of the then Gouernor a kinseman of Sr Thomas Smith as wherby hee in a manner spoyled and destroyed the wholl Planta?on as is extant yett to be seen by the ?res of Sr Thomas Smith himselfe &amp; ye said Alderman Iohnson. The effect was yt in that Planta?on after the expenc of 80000 pounds of ye publique Stocke and vpward, The Colony was then wasted to a few hundred of ?sonns no provisions beinge made by wives for posteritie and those also wch remayned had no intent to ?ceed in the Planta?on beinge destitude of ffoode both spirituall and temporall, cryinge outt vppon the Company for iniustice and crueltie and sometimes vppon dispayre beinge all shipped [284] to returne att other times vppon revenge adoptinge to themselvs newe Patrons against their ill Gouerment. And here att home the Adventurers who att the first as to a new matter came plentifully §in§ In fine vtterly abandoninge the Courts and Ac?on refusinge to make payments of their monneys subscribed and beinge sued for the same pleaded in Chancery vppon their Oathes that the monneys wer not converted to the vse intended butt to particuler mens gaines and that ther were no Accompts kept in order, and to be seen a thinge contrary to ye express charge in his Mats said Instruc?ons, And this is the true estate of the saide milde and Discreet Gouerment. On the Contrary side what hath been done in poynt of Gouermt for these 4 last years may be apparent to all men: Books of Orders for the good Gouer- ment of the Companies heer drawne principally out of the wisdome of his Matys originall graunts have been compiled and published; The like done in greatest ?t for the Gouermt of the Plantacons for the Dividinge of the Lands and for the setlinge of Adventurers and Planters in their quyett possessions; Skore of Preachers have been sent wth Competent provisions All wch brought soe great Content vnto the Plantacons abroad that ye Colony in Virginia hath by publique Act in their gen9all Assemblie yeilded thanks to the Company here for yt their Loue, Iustice, and Care, As for the Discord and dissen?on menconed in the said Peti?on true itt is yt in the Compass of these 4 last years their have been Two great Rents made by way of opposite ffac?on, the one by Alderman Iohnson being called on for his Accompts for wch in regard of his place hee was very moderately censured. And the other by mr Wrote vppõ other pryvate discontent for wch hee hath been lately suspended from the Courts. Ther hath been allso hertofore a fac- tion raysed in the Counsell for support of a Gouernor of Virginia who had ransaked the Planta?on, Other discord or discention of note ther hath not been any, and all these raysed by the ?t now oppugninge the Companies; The great- est nomber of whome are seldome seen in ye Court?, butt vpon occasion of a Storme &amp; to nourish Discord and ffaction. As for the Allega?on that divers of the Antient Adventurers and Planters conceive them selvs to have been iniured abused &amp; oppressed itt cannott be shewne that the Iustice wch was in the power of the Court? to give, hath been denyed to any man much less by pryvate dyrec?ons and vnderhand ?res have the goods of some particuler ?sonns in ye Planta?ons been taken vyolently from them contrary to course of Lawe &amp; consigned into the possession of their Potent adversaries, As hath lately happened in the case of Capt Miles Kendall who was spoyled by Capt Butler of 14 Negroes graunted to him by a Captaine of Holland havinge Comission from the Prince of Orange vnder a bare and false pretence yt they belonged to a Ship called the Treasuror sett out from Virginia by Sr Samuell Argall then Gouernor to prey on the West Indies as shall be elswere showne. The second Information by the Peti?oners is, That vnder ye form9 Gou9mt ther was a quyett entertaynment of the Savadge Indians by wch sundry of those Infidles and some of emynent note wer couerted to Christian Religion wheras of late there hath been a Massacre and Hostillytie between the Natives and our Colony of Virginia. [285] Herevnto wee ansvere yt itt is true that Matoar the daughter of Pohatan being taken Prisoner by Capt Argall and affectinge marriage wth one mr Rolf became a Christian and soe dyed att Grauesend, Other matter of note for con version ?of? those Infidells did not happen in those first 12 years duringe wch time the English were allmost allso in §continuall§ Hostilitie wth ye Infidells, And in the last of those 12 years the Chichohonini by sudden assault murdered Tenn of our People wch Capt Argall att his co?inge away lefte vnreuenged On the other side what and how chargable prepara?ons have been made in these laste 4 years for the educatinge of the Infidells Children in Christian Religion and Civility The Planta?on for the Colledge may sufficiently declare, ffor Which notwthstandinge the late Massacre wch fell vppon them ther are yett remayninge 60 Tenants or theraboutes, and the worke by the Assistance of god shall againe §in due time§ ?ceed As for the Hostilitie wth the Infidells dur- inge 3: of these last 4 years ther hath not been any wherof yett wee boast not consideringe that itt lulled the English asleepe in too great securitie and con- sequently gaue o?tunitie to ye late bloody Massacre wch if itt had not happened these opposers must have been mute haveinge nothinge else wherwth to dis- grace the Planta?on. The Third Informa?on is yt in the Compass of those first 12 years Staple Com- odities began to be raysed and imported into this Kingdome, as Iron, Stur- gion, Caveare, Sope and Pottashes, Masts for Ships, Clapbourd, Pipestaues, Waynscott, Wyne Pitch and Tarr and that most desyred worke of Silkwormes, wheras in the latter years the foresaid Comodities doe not appeare. The answere is that this Informa?on or obieccon doth strongly reflect vppon the obiector himselfe for if itt be true wch wee deny not save onely for Iron yt some samples of these Comodities by the Industry of Sr Tho: Dale were sent home in ye 9th and tenth year of those 12 first years; how happened itt that in the last two years vnder1 1 The first evidence of erasure in the MS. is found in this place, with the words "vnder ye Gouer." ye Gouerment of Capt Argall there appeared none, The reason is apparant for the magazine beinge then on foote wherof the said Alderman Iohnson was Director, itt pleased him to sett noe price vppon any other Comoditie, saue Tobacco and Sassafras, beinge Comodities of his owne Trade, and for ye greatest ?t wherof hee became the Companies Chapman, wherby all the endeavours for those other Comodities were abandoned and the Colony possessed of yt Dotinge affection to Tobacco, wch ye Compa: in these latter years notwthstandinge their sundry Charters, Instruc?ons and generall ?res for restrayninge therof could never since extinguish; On the Contrary ?t in these last 4 years what hath been ?formed from time to time by the excess- ive charge and care of the Company, In settinge vpp of In Iron works; Vine yeards Silke and other Comodities shalbe elswhere att large declared, and would by this time have manyfestly appeared, to the world had not the late Generall Massacre given them a sore interrup?on wch notwthstandinge by the Divine Assistance shalbe shortly renued. Now forasmuch as Alderman Iohnson pretendeth ye said Informa?on &amp; ye Peti- tion ensuinge itt to ayme att noe other end butt yt after the worke of some necessary reforma?on the worke allso of the Planta?on may be renued ?ceed and pros?; Wee are forced herin to detect his vncleer ?ceedings for itt wilbe iustified against him by vndenyable proofe, that hee ?hath? laboured of late by strange and most vntrue allega?ons to discourrage some ?sonns of very good quallytie from fauoringe of this worke or ?ceedinge in itt, hee hath found fault wth such as hath co?ended the Country soe much extolled by himselfe formerly in sundry his printed treatises ?fessinge that ye world had been deluded by Virginia; Hee hath said that ther are two many of our nation there alredy, that the Staple Comodities spoken of will com to nothinge; That the Iron was a base Comodity and would not pay ?for? ye fraight That the grapes were sower and the Clymate not pro? for wine; That ye Mulberie-Trees in Virginia have a prickle in their leaves wch destroyed the Silkworms when itt grew to biggnes; And as for convertinge of the Infidells itt was an attempt impossible they being descended of ye cursed race of Cham; Now whether a ?son of this disposi?on be a fitt Instrument for ye workinge out of ye good of ye Planta?ons, wee leaue itt to all cleer &amp; vnpartiall mindes to iudge. Touchinge ye Petition itt selfe for examina?on &amp; reforma?on of all abuses ye Companies doe therin willingly concurr wth ye Petio?oners saue yt they cannot but dislike ye petitioners too great ?tiallytie who desire onely yt ye Acompts since Sr Tho: Smiths time may be examyned wch have been allwaies kept fairly accordinge to ye orders of Court? (exceptinge by one onely of ye Peti?oners society) And for ye Accompts of ye former years pass them ouer in sylence wch are 3 times as greate and thrise 3 times more questionable: Butt ye Iustice of ye Honoble: Bourd hath reformed their partiallytie.

[287] And touchinge ye last 3 Articles of §ye said§ Capt Butlers informa?on wher vnto the said 16 ?sonns say they cann make no Answere the same beinge either aboue or wthout the Compass of their knowledge, the Company for the present Returne this Answere in breife. To ye first of them beinge the 8th Article and conteyninge onely a discrip?on of Devasta?on of Two Plantacons called Henrico &amp; Charles Citty by the late Massacre by the Infidles, wch might easily indeed haue been preserved if the said Massacre had been foreseen or feared; The Company can say no more butt yt itt was the vnavoydable Calamytie of such a Treacherous Warr but ye Planta- ?ons as they hope are againe restored accordinge to express order given from hence to the Colony. To ye 9th Article conteyninge a Complainte of the new Gouermt now in Vir- ginia they haue noe cause to give any Creditt to the said Information; The same in appearance beinge grounded vppon the said Captaines Discontent, and for yt hee was not accepted there to sitt in Counsell wth them where to hee could plead neither right nor deserte. To ye last Article beinge a conclusion of all his former misinformationns wth addi?on allso of some new vntruths they say that ther were never sent aboue 6000: to Virginia wch is short 4000 of his informa?on And yt in the first 12 year? by the best Computa?on that can now be made ther haveinge been no Accompt then kept ?either? of their names or nombers ther were not sent aboue 2500: att the vtmoste wherof there dyed 500 att Sea.

After wch mr Berblock desired, that a short passage of Sr Tho Dales ?re to Sr Tho: Smith might be read wch he had found ?vsing the Bookes by order of ye Court; Wherevpon it was read, being as fol- loweth (viztt) Lett me tell you all at home this one thinge, and I pray remember it, (if you giue ouer this Country and loose it, you with your wisedomes will leape such a gugion as our state hath not done the like, since they lost ye Kingdome of ffraunce: be not gulled with the clamorous reports of base people: beleiue Caleb and Iosuah, if the glory of god hath noe power with them and the conuersion of these poore Infi- dells: yet lett ye rich Mammons desires egge them on to inhabite these Countries.

Dated Iune 1613. Wch report mr Iohn Smith affirmed to agree wth what he had heard from his owne mouth deliuered to diuers worthy persons here in England, protesting from his heart vnfaignedly, that in his iudgmt out of ffoure of the best Kingdomes in Europe, there could not be picked out soe much good ground as was in Virginia. Wch speech in effect mr Copland also affirmed Sr Tho: Dale to haue spoken to him at Iapan in ye West Indies. There was also read part of a ?re of Sr Samuell Argolls vnto ye Com- pany in Iuly 1617. comendinge very much the healthines of Iames Towne, &amp; that it was ye fittest and convenientest place for vnladinge, being in ye middest of ye Planta?ons, and there being a Bridge to Land good? at all tymes. The Lo: Cauendish further acquaynted the Companies, that the Counsell for Virginia and Principall Assistant? of ye Su?er Ilandes had vpon Large and serious considera?on of these ?sent distrac?ons in ye Company drawne by a certen Declaration, conteyning in their iudgmt One mayne roote of these troubles, wch they thought fitt to pre- sent to ye Court, wch was ordered to be read being as followeth, viztt May 7th, 1623.

Order of the Courte of the 23th of Aprill and takinge into considera?on the present Differ- ences and distrac?ons in the Company and accordinge to their duty entringe into a serious consulta?on howe to extinguish or Compose the same, that the worke of the Planta?on may as hertofore proceed and prosper. They have found in their vnderstandinge that one cheife roote of all these Diuisionns and of Sundry other Machina?ons to the great Detriment of the Planta?ons and bendinge wthall to a course for dissolu?on of the Companies, have ?ceeded from some Instrue?ons?ments? about the Right Honor?: the Earle of War- wick who by misinforma?ons and false ?tences as they conceive abusinge the facilitie and forwardnes of his disposi?on for the atchiuinge of their owne [289] exorbitant purposes, haue enforced them after longe patience now to discouer the same, while remedie is to be had; least in time the disease growe remediles. Itt is therfore first of all to be laide a true grounde that these Instrumts about his Lop: not content with that Lawfull and orderly benyfitt wch the Aduen- turers for the saide Planta?ons might in a due course and fitt time expect, butt effectinge a suddaine and extraordinarie wealth by spoylynge of the publique State of ye Colonies and oppressinge allso of the multitude of perticularr Planters in them, and beinge not able to run on in a swifte and vninterrupted current, wthout gayninge allso the Gouerment of ye Companies here att home into their owne or their assured frends hands &amp; possession wherby to be also enabled to place Gouernors from time to time in the Colonyes abroade, men of their owne creation and assured to their deuotion, have lefte noe means nor practise vnattempted duringe the space of divers years past for the bringinge to effect both of the one and the other. ffirst therfore in the begining of ye year 1617 §a§ course was taken yt Capt Argall now Sr Samuell Argall an assured follower and fauorite of his ?op: should be sent wth the power both of Gouernor and Admirall into Virginia Armed allso wth the strength and exercise of Marshall Lawe even in the time of peace, that no man ther might dare to open his mouth in any complainte against him, wherof hee sett vpp a memorable warninge by example in the case of Captaine Bruster; Whome for opposinge against his course of destroy- ing that great Planta?on begunn by the late Lo: D˜: Laware and of drawinge the whole benifitt therof to his owne pryvate advantage hee procured to be condempned moste vniustly by a Marshalls Courte to deathe. and deliuered him not from the same butt vppon taking an vniust oath ?scribed to him to this effect. That hee should not speak ill of Capt Argalls Gouermt: nor ever againe returne into the Teritories of Virginia and to ?tect Capt Argall from beinge called to an after Account for his Gouerment, vnder shew of a new Planta?on to be sett vpp in Virginia by the saide Capt: Argall and his Partners, wherof ye saide Earle [290] hath since appeared to be one (wch yet to this day hath hadd no begininge) ther was procured a Patent to ye said Captaine and his Associates for the said New Planta?on Wherby hee and his Company their heirs and Assignes (saue onely in time of necessary defence by Warr) were exempted from all power authoritie &amp; iurisdi?on to be from hence derived or there established, that soe hee might raigne there as a great and absolute Maister wthout Lawe or controlement, and wthout the fear of euer beinge called to any future reckoninge. Thus furnished wth exorbitant power and exemp?on how hee carryed himselfe ther in his two yeares Gouerment hath been elswhere att large Declared The sume is that besides a multitude of particularr wrongs and oppressions; what- soeuer was remayninge att that time in the Colony belonginge to ye publique and beinge the ffruite of ffoureskore Thousande pounds charge hee converted itt in a manner wholly to his owne pryvate vse and possession; the verie pub- lique Lands Cultivated, the Companies Tenants and Servants, their Corne, Rents and Tributes of Corne their Kine and other Cattle, their Stores and Pro- visions Wherby the Company beinge disabled in all appearance ever to sett upp the same againe or to bear the great burden of publique charge both att home and abrode (beinge thus stripped of all revennue) the said Compa: must have fayled and decayed, and the wholl Colony in time have fallen into the hands of the saide Captaine and his Association to be there established wch seemeth to have been his prime and originall desire. Neither could this Deprada?on of that Colony content but a Ship called the Treasuror sett forth by the said Earle and sent to Virginia and an olde Comission of hostility from the Duke of Sauoy against the Spanyards ?cured by some means and putt into the hands of the saide Captaine, The said Treasuror beinge manned wth the ablest men of the Colony &amp; new victualled from thence, was sett outt on Rovinge on ye Spanish Dominions in the West Indies, wher after sundry Actes of Hostilitie comitted and some purchase gotten shee Returnes to Virginia att the end of tenn monneths or theraboutes. Butt findinge Capt Argall the setter of [291] her out, De?ted from thence, shee wthdrew herselfe instantlie from the new Gou- ernors power and went to ye So?er Ilands then discharginge her booty, In wch were a certaine nomber of Negroes; All wch even those that belonged as Shares to ye Marryners (wherof they haue not long since complayned in Court) were taken and placed on the said Earles Lands, as belonginge to his Lop and soe continue. This course of Capt Argalls sendinge home a strange murmur of Complaints against him in the Summer i6i8: Sr Thomas Smith beinge then Treasurer and Alderman Iohnson Depty the Compa: were soe enflamed wth these outrages that they could hardly be conteyned from runinge to his Matie: then beinge in prog- ress to craue his supreame hand for redresse of soe great a mischeife Butt Sr Thomas Smith att that time whether in favour of the said Capt Argall his frend and kinesman or outt of his better iudgmt alledginge yt the imploringe of his Mats: aide might proue a Deroga?on to the Companies power and liberties made stay of that course, and dyrected the Company into another &amp; milder way Wch after the misprosperinge of some some other ?vision for reforma- ?on, by the vnfortunate decease of the Lord Lawarr cheife Gouernor issued finally into a resolution of sendinge a new Gouernor, to examine those Clamors and Complaints against Captaine Argall; Whervppon at the Michaellmas ensu- inge Capt Yeardley afterward Sr George Yeardley was first nominated Gouer- nor and afterwards solemly chosen att the next Quarter Courte. Before wch time in the said Summer i6i8 vppon the Clamors aforesaid Sr Thomas Smith and Alderman Iohnson wth Divers others of the Counsell addressed their ?res to ye saide Lord Lawarr lately gone for Virginia requyr- inge him to send home the saide Captaine Argall in quallety of a Mallefactor and to sequester all his goods there for restitu?on to ye Company; ther was afterwards an order resolved in Court that what goods of Capt Argalls should be returned for England should be likewise seized on for the Companies vse. Wch order att the saide Earles request was so farr forth dispensed wth as that his Lordshipp notwthstandinge might take out his owne ?t (intendinge so much as should belonge vnto him by his right of ?tnership) vppon ?mise to deliuer the rest into the Companies hands so farr forth as should be in his Lops: power to ?forme itt. The ?formance of wch ?mises is yett still expected the said Captaine haueinge returned all his goods from Virginia vnder other mens names, and consigned them [292] into other and greater mens hands, wherby the Company remayneth still defrauded of the due restitu?on wch they had so great cause to expect from Captaine Argall. Butt to come to some other partes of Captaine Argalls Gou9ment this Course of Deprada?on and Rovinge not sufficeinge as likely to receave encounter and Check from hence; New Engines were vsed, some to disharten and some to disgrace ye Company that soe as itt seemeth they might in time abandon the Plantacon and leave itt as a prey to the saide Captaine his frends and followers: ffirst therfore from the Plantacon ?res were sent by Captaine Argall &amp; directed to the Company by wch hee soe dispraysed the Country as to appear less fertile then the most barren arable Land to be found ordinarylie in this Realme. An assured way of discouragmt to all Adventurers and Planters from further ?ceedinge Butt this Engine was broken by a Comission sent into Virginia from whenc was returned by examina?on vppon oath that the soyle was most fertile &amp; that slander therof moste vntrue. Then next on the other side to Correspond from hence ye Company and their Ac?ons, and ?ticularly the Gouernors, Alderman Iohnson by name were dis- graced by letters sent into Virginia not vnknowne (as is stronglie to be ?sumed) to ye saide Earle In wch was suggested that the Marchants as they termed them who then swayed the Courts affected nothinge but their owne immoderate gaine though wth the poore Planters extreame oppression as appeared by their Magazine: By wch and other insinua?ons that the said Earle would goe and Complaine to the Kinge in their behalfe; They were drawne on by Instru- ments vsed fittly for that purpose to exclame wth great bitternes against the Company and in a manner to cast of their Gouerment adoptinge vnto them- selvs other Patrones against them accordinge to their seuerall Planta?ons the Principall wherof were Partners to the said Capt Argall amongst wch ye said Earle of Warwick was in degree farr ye cheife. All this notwthstandinge the Company proceeded on in their course against Capt Argall and by advise of the Counsell and a choyse Comittee prepared divers Comissions to be sent wth Sr George Yeardley for the proceedinge against the Captaine in Virginia. Against wch the said Earle wth other of his frends and followers haveinge made great opposi?on butt not ?vaylinge a Course was taken in fine to dispatch a Pinnace from Plymoth to fetch away Captaine Argall wth his goods &amp; booty before the Arryvall of Sr Georg Yeard- ley &amp; his Comissions. The said Sr George Yeardley by the ?swasions (as is vehemently to be ?sumed of mr Pory whom the said Earle had lately co?- ended vnto Sr Thomas Smith then Treasuror for the Secretaries place of Vir- ginia) spendinge much time vnnescesarily vppon our English Coaste. [293] Butt the saide Earle still ill1 1 Written over the word "is" by Collingwood. sattisfied with the ?ceedings against Capt: Argall in the Easter Tearme ensuinge 1619 pursued wth great ernestnes the dis- placeinge of Sr Tho: Smith and Alderman Iohnson from the Gouerment of ye Company wch succeeded accordinglie. But to stop the course of the saide Comissions in Virginia for examina?on of the Ac?ons and Gouerment of Capt Argall whose ?sonn was now escaped from thence new wayes had been &amp; were still devised: ffirst mr Pory sworne Secre- tarie of Estate there and who wrote the examina?ons taken by vertue of the said Comissions, sent Coppies of those examina?ons vnderhand to the said Earle. Wch beinge Discouered &amp; hee stopped in yt Course; a new way was taken soe to daunte Sr George Yeardley as might cleane discourrage him from ?ceedinge in the said Comissionns. ffor the said Earle haveinge published great displeasure against ye said Sr Georg Yeardley for interceptinge the Pac- quett wherin ye Coppies of the aforesaid Examina?ons were sent vnto him and threatninge a Sharpe revenge itt was soone after rumored by some of the Earles followers and spred ou9 Virginia and even to Opochancano himselfe that the Earle would com shortly ouer in ?sonn to be their Gouernor, And that Capt Argall would bee his Pylott, and then hee would call Sr George Yeardley into like question &amp; examination for his owne Gouerment: Wch Rumor con- firmed allso by letters from hence is thought to have been a principall cause of that extreame descouragmt and Deiec?on of Sr George Yeardley, wch end- inge in a long sicknes caused a generall neglect in followinge the publique businies, wch otherwise might have ?ceeded to the effect here intended. Now att the Arrivall here of Captaine Argall in ye form9 parte of the yeare 1619: when Sr Edwin Sandys was Treasuror The Counsell after some time ?ceeded to ye examina?on of the said Captaine havinge wthdrawne himselfe from due tryall in the parts wher ye ffacts were Co?itted and where the true proofs on both sides were to be readilie had. Here howe hee was patronized by ye saide Earle and by Sr Nathaniell Rich to ye hindrance of ye Course of Iustice and of due restitu?on; how the Treasuror was wronged in ?forminge his office and oath and sought to be [294] deterred even by threats of bloud from acquaintinge ye LLs of his Mats: most honobe Pryvy Counsell wth the Colonyes complainte of that Rovinge Ship the Treas- uror, shalbe here passed ouer and referred to any other place. Butt by these meanes the matter was drawne to soe extreame length and the Counsell and Company soe extreamly weryed that in fine Capt Argall goinge the Voyadge to Argier all further ?secu?on hath been since susspended and the Compa: defrauded of ye great restitu?on wch after soe great wronge they had great reason to expect. ffrom wch time the saide Earle and Sr Nathaniell Rich wth others his Lops: fol- lowers have generally absented them selves from the Courts of the Company and other meetings in Counsell, And the said Earle and Sr Nathaniell Rich to- gether wth Sr Thomas Smith haue allsoe sould awaie their Adventures in the ?ticuler Planta?on wherof they were. In the meane time the Company hath continued in a Constant Tenor of great peace and tranquillytie pursuing ye buisines of the Planta?on wth great zeale and industry and that wthout inter- rup?on by any shaddowe of ffac?on till this last great rent wherof shalbe spoken in a more proper place. ffor now to take a veiwe allso of the like ?ceedings for the Sum?er Ilands The Company therof beinge vnwillinge from the begininge that the saide Earle or any other great ?sonn should grow too greate in the saide Ilands;—(haveinge great cause to feare the same) had obteyned yt in his Mats ?res Patents, itt should be lymited that no one Adventurer might be owner ?of1 1 The word "of" written over "in" by Collingwood, the reviewer. ? aboue fifteen shares in the said Ilands amountinge vnto about the Twentieth ?t of the Land there. And that no matter of importance touchinge the state of the said Ilands should be ordered butt in one of their great Quarter Courts to be held in the ffower Tearmes when in likely hood the most principall and greatest number of the Adventurers would be present: These clauses of restrainte beinge no way pleasinge as itt seemeth to his Lop: as beinge opposite to the mayne ends ?iected by his ffollowers a course was taken in the time of Sr Thomas Smiths Gouerment to finde fault wth the ?res Patents vppon ?tence of other defect? and an order of Courte gotten for drawinge of a new Patent to be ?cured from his Maty: vppon surrender of the former, and the care of drawinge itt was co?ended to one mr Phesant a Councellor att Law belonginge to his Lop: and vppõ whome hee had bestowed either really or titularly one [295] of his Shares in the So?er Ilands. This new Patent beinge drawne and a time appoynted for readinge itt to the Company, vppon notice of some suspi?on that ther was no good meaninge in itt ther happened to be some present who seemed were not looked for as haveinge of a longe time forborne those Courts. The con- clusion was that in this new intended Patent, the Institu?on of Qu: Courtes and lymytacon of number of shares were cleane o?itted wch beinge discouered the new draught was reiected and the Company well armed against the like attempt in future times. There remayned as itt seemeth for supply to their desires that his Lop should yett be soe strengthned in ye Courtes att home and soe powerfull by his Agents in those Ilands abrode that all things might be disposed of by their absolute pleasure. ffor the Courts att home besides other his ffollowers wch did the like; His Lop: was allsoe induced to putt of divers of his ffifteene Shares to Sundry new personns amongst wch were Capt Argall and a Brother of Capt: Butlers. By wch means in that small Courte they have ingreatned their power. And as for the Colony itt selfe hee ?cured his ffollower and ffauourite Capt Butler to be chosen Gouernor duringe these last three years who strengthning himselfe by the Associa?on of a Turbulent and ill affected ?sonn, one mr Lewis Hughes a Mynister (who had preached in the Su?er Ilands that the Gouer- ment of ye Church of England by Bishops was Antichristian and that the Booke of Common prayers was butt an Old wiues tale, fitt to be read by ye fireside as was iustified to his face): What course they tooke to alienate the Inhabitants hearts from the Compa: &amp; from the Gouermt therof established here by his Maty: &amp; what oppressions were exercised ouer ?ticularr ?sons appeareth as in ?t by other good proofes, soe partly by ye multitude of per- ticular complaintes against ?the sd? Capt Butler wherof ther shalbe considera- ?on taken had elsewhere in his due place one onely example shalbe here ?duced. In the latter time that Capt Kendall was Deputy Gouernor there arryved att the Summer Ilands (vizt. in ye year 1619) A man of warr wth a Comission from ye Prince of Orange by vertue wherof hee had taken certaine Negros in the West Indies: And beinge in great extremity for want of water and Victuall and forbid by Capt Kendall to com into any of the said Harbors, hee gave him notice [296] that hee had ffourteen Negroes abourd wch if hee should be forced to cast ouer bord for want of Victuall and wather desired to bestow them vppon Capt Kendall for any small considera?on wch hee should be pleased to give him: wch was ?formed accordinglie: Captaine Kendall who had spent a long time in the Summer Ilands beinge one of ye first Inhabitants and who for his valour and other good carriadge had been in time of Vacancy twice chosen Gouernor, Now vppon ye Arrivall of Capt Butler was forcibly by him depryved of all his said Negros vppon ?tence that they belonged vnto the Earle of Warwicks Shipp called the Treasuror wth wch the said Holland man of Warre had consorted, This outrage of ?by? Captaine Butler Vppon ye Goods of his ?discessor so contrary to all Lawe and forme of Iustice and with- out any order for ought euer appeared, enforced Capt Kendall to returne into England and to exhibite his Complainte to the Company against Captaine Butler, wher itt pleased the said Earle to make claime in open Courte, that the said Negroes were his, as belonginge vnto his Ship the Treasuror afore- said, And to crosse Capt: Kendall in his iust Demaund certaine Articles of Complainte were exhibited against him wthout author to advow them, and wthout wittness to proue them wch beinge referred vnto examyna?on in the Su?er Ilands where hee that did him wronge was allso to bee his Iudge was the cause that for a longe while hee gott noe restitution About Mid sommer 1622 the Court takinge considera?on of the wrong done to Captaine Kendall; and the Earle of Warwick referringe his Claime to the Iudgment of the Courte, itt was ordered that Nyne of the same Negroes should be deliuered to Capt Kendall, and the rest to be consigned to ye Companies vse wch the new Gouernor Capt Bernard lately deceased was required by his Instruc?ons to ?see? putt in execu?on. After whose decease by a ?re ther ?duced as from the said Earle importinge that the said Negroes should not be deliuered vnto the said Kendall and vppon advantage taken of mistakinge the Hollanders name, the said restitution is still deferred and the poore gentleman still lan- guisheth vnder the effects of most vniust oppression; Soe weake are the Com- panies orders in that Planta?on if they come once to be countermaunded by any mandate from his Lop: Butt to returne to the conclusion of Capt Butlers Gouerment who ?ceivinge by the multitude of Complaintes against him that hee had incurred some Dis- pleasure wth the Company and as itt seemed vppon iust feare that a Comission would be awarded to the new Gouernor and others for the examyninge of his ?ceedings aboute the last ?late? Spanish Wrack there so much complayned of and for other misdemeanors wherwth hee stood heavilie charged [297] whether in revenge therof or in pursuite of the aforesaid ends he entred into combi- na?on wth the said mr Lewis Hughes and some other fitt Instruments for such a purpose to make a collection of certaine Greivances to be exhibited to the Inhabitants against the Company and withall for a peti?on to the ?s of ye Company first and afterward to the Kinge for alteringe the Gouerment of the Company here as beinge Antimonarchicall, and for ye reducinge itt into the hands of a few principall personns. This done and beinge laden itt seems wth wealth and mallice contrary to a solemne order by himselfe enacted, and to ye desire of the Inhabitants by the help of a small Ship provided to fetch him away from the Summer Ilands (as the same had been done vppon the like occasion for Capt Argall from Virginia) hee was conveyed thence a little before the new Gouernors Arrivall and soe deliuered from the tryall intended by the said Comission, Leavinge those Ilands wth the Inhabitants in a most myserable plight. Butt Capt Butler (as itt seemeth) not satiated wth his wrong to that Planta?on and to the Company heer for ye same goeth from thence to Virginia to be revenged allsoe on ye other Company for that other Planta?on consistinge in great part of the selfe same ?sonns. To Virginia hee came in an ill season of the yeare towardes the extremity of Winter, and in a worse time otherwise after the late Massacre where beinge refused to sitt in Counsell wth them, wherto hee could shewe no right though otherwise entertayned wth very great courtesie, hee fedd his eyes wth the mis- erable spectacle of a Country ouerrun §wth§1 1 Written over "&amp;" by the copyist. a late Treacherous warr, wch in a harte of any sence of mortall Calamytie would have wrought though not a Christian yett an humaine Compassion. Butt hee soone after returrninge into England, and findinge the Companies full of trouble by some ffactious Spirites and that enquyrie was allredie made, and some reasonable Discouery of his vnthankfull practise and conspiracie in the said Summer Ilands to deprive them of that Gouerment, by whome and by wch himselfe was made Gouernor means was found by some of the aforesaid Instru- ments that hee should be brought vnto ye Kinge and co?aunded as is said to make vnto his Maty: a true Relation of the State of Virginia, wch Relation termed by himselfe an Vnmaskinge of Virginia and consistinge of an extreame disgraceinge of that Country &amp; Planta?on together wth a moste bitter aspersion vppon [298] the Gouerment therof both there and here, how farr itt is in all materiall poyntes from truth, hath soe fully appeared by vndenyable proofe as that impudencie itt selfe cannot open mouth to excuse itt. In fine these disguised Accons beinge vnmasked they now playnly professe, Sr Nathaniell Rich in the Courte his Brotherinlawe Sr Thomas Wroth att the Counsell Board Alderman Iohnson in his Petition to his Matie, Capt Butler in his Dismaskinge and others by other means some of them in one parte and some of them in another yt they desire an altera?on of the Gouerment in both Companies; wherby as may be very stronglie presumed (comparinge their former ?ceedings wth the present) to drawe the Planta?ons into their former Estate of beinge Subiects vnto their Ambition and inexpleable avarice. In the meane time their practises and labours are infinite in disgraceinge wth all kindes of Calumnies &amp; slanders the present Gouerment of the Companies wth their Ac?ons and ?sonns The said Earle allso apparantly (to drawe (itt seemeth) vnto himselfe some showe of a partie) countenancinge and graceinge all kindes of opposites to the Companies vppon what cause ever soe ever, and though hertofore sundry of them noe less opposite allsoe to his Lop: And vnder ?tence of iustifyinge those their manyfold vntruthes they have sued for a Comission to examine those Imputa?ons wherwth they have been pleased to charge the Gouerment in these fower last years. Wch Comission by his Mats grace and the Lords noble Iustice ordayned to extend allso to ye Twelue years of the former Gouermt, and the Companies ernestly pressinge them to take out their Comission they have still delayed and doe delay the same knowinge (as itt seemeth) in their owne guilty consiencies that they are neither in any degree able to charge the latter nor yett to excuse ye former Gouer- ment. This Remonstrance of the strange and longe continued ?ceedings of the Instru- ments afore saide, ye said Counsell and principall Assistants haue thought fitt to gather into one bodie, and soe to offer itt to ye veiwe and Iudgment of the generall Court? beinge a matter of the highest importance yt ever came into their considera?ons, as concerninge not a fewe Branches, butt the very Bodies lyfe and subsistence of both the Planta?ons and Companie.

Order of the Courte of the 23th of Aprill and takinge into considera?on the present Differ- ences and distrac?ons in the Company and accordinge to their duty entringe into a serious consulta?on howe to extinguish or Compose the same, that the worke of the Planta?on may as hertofore proceed and prosper. They have found in their vnderstandinge that one cheife roote of all these Diuisionns and of Sundry other Machina?ons to the great Detriment of the Planta?ons and bendinge wthall to a course for dissolu?on of the Companies, have ?ceeded from some Instrue?ons?ments? about the Right Honor?: the Earle of War- wick who by misinforma?ons and false ?tences as they conceive abusinge the facilitie and forwardnes of his disposi?on for the atchiuinge of their owne [289] exorbitant purposes, haue enforced them after longe patience now to discouer the same, while remedie is to be had; least in time the disease growe remediles. Itt is therfore first of all to be laide a true grounde that these Instrumts about his Lop: not content with that Lawfull and orderly benyfitt wch the Aduen- turers for the saide Planta?ons might in a due course and fitt time expect, butt effectinge a suddaine and extraordinarie wealth by spoylynge of the publique State of ye Colonies and oppressinge allso of the multitude of perticularr Planters in them, and beinge not able to run on in a swifte and vninterrupted current, wthout gayninge allso the Gouerment of ye Companies here att home into their owne or their assured frends hands &amp; possession wherby to be also enabled to place Gouernors from time to time in the Colonyes abroade, men of their owne creation and assured to their deuotion, have lefte noe means nor practise vnattempted duringe the space of divers years past for the bringinge to effect both of the one and the other. ffirst therfore in the begining of ye year 1617 §a§ course was taken yt Capt Argall now Sr Samuell Argall an assured follower and fauorite of his ?op: should be sent wth the power both of Gouernor and Admirall into Virginia Armed allso wth the strength and exercise of Marshall Lawe even in the time of peace, that no man ther might dare to open his mouth in any complainte against him, wherof hee sett vpp a memorable warninge by example in the case of Captaine Bruster; Whome for opposinge against his course of destroy- ing that great Planta?on begunn by the late Lo: D˜: Laware and of drawinge the whole benifitt therof to his owne pryvate advantage hee procured to be condempned moste vniustly by a Marshalls Courte to deathe. and deliuered him not from the same butt vppon taking an vniust oath ?scribed to him to this effect. That hee should not speak ill of Capt Argalls Gouermt: nor ever againe returne into the Teritories of Virginia and to ?tect Capt Argall from beinge called to an after Account for his Gouerment, vnder shew of a new Planta?on to be sett vpp in Virginia by the saide Capt: Argall and his Partners, wherof ye saide Earle [290] hath since appeared to be one (wch yet to this day hath hadd no begininge) ther was procured a Patent to ye said Captaine and his Associates for the said New Planta?on Wherby hee and his Company their heirs and Assignes (saue onely in time of necessary defence by Warr) were exempted from all power authoritie &amp; iurisdi?on to be from hence derived or there established, that soe hee might raigne there as a great and absolute Maister wthout Lawe or controlement, and wthout the fear of euer beinge called to any future reckoninge. Thus furnished wth exorbitant power and exemp?on how hee carryed himselfe ther in his two yeares Gouerment hath been elswhere att large Declared The sume is that besides a multitude of particularr wrongs and oppressions; what- soeuer was remayninge att that time in the Colony belonginge to ye publique and beinge the ffruite of ffoureskore Thousande pounds charge hee converted itt in a manner wholly to his owne pryvate vse and possession; the verie pub- lique Lands Cultivated, the Companies Tenants and Servants, their Corne, Rents and Tributes of Corne their Kine and other Cattle, their Stores and Pro- visions Wherby the Company beinge disabled in all appearance ever to sett upp the same againe or to bear the great burden of publique charge both att home and abrode (beinge thus stripped of all revennue) the said Compa: must have fayled and decayed, and the wholl Colony in time have fallen into the hands of the saide Captaine and his Association to be there established wch seemeth to have been his prime and originall desire. Neither could this Deprada?on of that Colony content but a Ship called the Treasuror sett forth by the said Earle and sent to Virginia and an olde Comission of hostility from the Duke of Sauoy against the Spanyards ?cured by some means and putt into the hands of the saide Captaine, The said Treasuror beinge manned wth the ablest men of the Colony &amp; new victualled from thence, was sett outt on Rovinge on ye Spanish Dominions in the West Indies, wher after sundry Actes of Hostilitie comitted and some purchase gotten shee Returnes to Virginia att the end of tenn monneths or theraboutes. Butt findinge Capt Argall the setter of [291] her out, De?ted from thence, shee wthdrew herselfe instantlie from the new Gou- ernors power and went to ye So?er Ilands then discharginge her booty, In wch were a certaine nomber of Negroes; All wch even those that belonged as Shares to ye Marryners (wherof they haue not long since complayned in Court) were taken and placed on the said Earles Lands, as belonginge to his Lop and soe continue. This course of Capt Argalls sendinge home a strange murmur of Complaints against him in the Summer i6i8: Sr Thomas Smith beinge then Treasurer and Alderman Iohnson Depty the Compa: were soe enflamed wth these outrages that they could hardly be conteyned from runinge to his Matie: then beinge in prog- ress to craue his supreame hand for redresse of soe great a mischeife Butt Sr Thomas Smith att that time whether in favour of the said Capt Argall his frend and kinesman or outt of his better iudgmt alledginge yt the imploringe of his Mats: aide might proue a Deroga?on to the Companies power and liberties made stay of that course, and dyrected the Company into another &amp; milder way Wch after the misprosperinge of some some other ?vision for reforma- ?on, by the vnfortunate decease of the Lord Lawarr cheife Gouernor issued finally into a resolution of sendinge a new Gouernor, to examine those Clamors and Complaints against Captaine Argall; Whervppon at the Michaellmas ensu- inge Capt Yeardley afterward Sr George Yeardley was first nominated Gouer- nor and afterwards solemly chosen att the next Quarter Courte. Before wch time in the said Summer i6i8 vppon the Clamors aforesaid Sr Thomas Smith and Alderman Iohnson wth Divers others of the Counsell addressed their ?res to ye saide Lord Lawarr lately gone for Virginia requyr- inge him to send home the saide Captaine Argall in quallety of a Mallefactor and to sequester all his goods there for restitu?on to ye Company; ther was afterwards an order resolved in Court that what goods of Capt Argalls should be returned for England should be likewise seized on for the Companies vse. Wch order att the saide Earles request was so farr forth dispensed wth as that his Lordshipp notwthstandinge might take out his owne ?t (intendinge so much as should belonge vnto him by his right of ?tnership) vppon ?mise to deliuer the rest into the Companies hands so farr forth as should be in his Lops: power to ?forme itt. The ?formance of wch ?mises is yett still expected the said Captaine haueinge returned all his goods from Virginia vnder other mens names, and consigned them [292] into other and greater mens hands, wherby the Company remayneth still defrauded of the due restitu?on wch they had so great cause to expect from Captaine Argall. Butt to come to some other partes of Captaine Argalls Gou9ment this Course of Deprada?on and Rovinge not sufficeinge as likely to receave encounter and Check from hence; New Engines were vsed, some to disharten and some to disgrace ye Company that soe as itt seemeth they might in time abandon the Plantacon and leave itt as a prey to the saide Captaine his frends and followers: ffirst therfore from the Plantacon ?res were sent by Captaine Argall &amp; directed to the Company by wch hee soe dispraysed the Country as to appear less fertile then the most barren arable Land to be found ordinarylie in this Realme. An assured way of discouragmt to all Adventurers and Planters from further ?ceedinge Butt this Engine was broken by a Comission sent into Virginia from whenc was returned by examina?on vppon oath that the soyle was most fertile &amp; that slander therof moste vntrue. Then next on the other side to Correspond from hence ye Company and their Ac?ons, and ?ticularly the Gouernors, Alderman Iohnson by name were dis- graced by letters sent into Virginia not vnknowne (as is stronglie to be ?sumed) to ye saide Earle In wch was suggested that the Marchants as they termed them who then swayed the Courts affected nothinge but their owne immoderate gaine though wth the poore Planters extreame oppression as appeared by their Magazine: By wch and other insinua?ons that the said Earle would goe and Complaine to the Kinge in their behalfe; They were drawne on by Instru- ments vsed fittly for that purpose to exclame wth great bitternes against the Company and in a manner to cast of their Gouerment adoptinge vnto them- selvs other Patrones against them accordinge to their seuerall Planta?ons the Principall wherof were Partners to the said Capt Argall amongst wch ye said Earle of Warwick was in degree farr ye cheife. All this notwthstandinge the Company proceeded on in their course against Capt Argall and by advise of the Counsell and a choyse Comittee prepared divers Comissions to be sent wth Sr George Yeardley for the proceedinge against the Captaine in Virginia. Against wch the said Earle wth other of his frends and followers haveinge made great opposi?on butt not ?vaylinge a Course was taken in fine to dispatch a Pinnace from Plymoth to fetch away Captaine Argall wth his goods &amp; booty before the Arryvall of Sr Georg Yeard- ley &amp; his Comissions. The said Sr George Yeardley by the ?swasions (as is vehemently to be ?sumed of mr Pory whom the said Earle had lately co?- ended vnto Sr Thomas Smith then Treasuror for the Secretaries place of Vir- ginia) spendinge much time vnnescesarily vppon our English Coaste. [293] Butt the saide Earle still ill1 1 Written over the word "is" by Collingwood. sattisfied with the ?ceedings against Capt: Argall in the Easter Tearme ensuinge 1619 pursued wth great ernestnes the dis- placeinge of Sr Tho: Smith and Alderman Iohnson from the Gouerment of ye Company wch succeeded accordinglie. But to stop the course of the saide Comissions in Virginia for examina?on of the Ac?ons and Gouerment of Capt Argall whose ?sonn was now escaped from thence new wayes had been &amp; were still devised: ffirst mr Pory sworne Secre- tarie of Estate there and who wrote the examina?ons taken by vertue of the said Comissions, sent Coppies of those examina?ons vnderhand to the said Earle. Wch beinge Discouered &amp; hee stopped in yt Course; a new way was taken soe to daunte Sr George Yeardley as might cleane discourrage him from ?ceedinge in the said Comissionns. ffor the said Earle haveinge published great displeasure against ye said Sr Georg Yeardley for interceptinge the Pac- quett wherin ye Coppies of the aforesaid Examina?ons were sent vnto him and threatninge a Sharpe revenge itt was soone after rumored by some of the Earles followers and spred ou9 Virginia and even to Opochancano himselfe that the Earle would com shortly ouer in ?sonn to be their Gouernor, And that Capt Argall would bee his Pylott, and then hee would call Sr George Yeardley into like question &amp; examination for his owne Gouerment: Wch Rumor con- firmed allso by letters from hence is thought to have been a principall cause of that extreame descouragmt and Deiec?on of Sr George Yeardley, wch end- inge in a long sicknes caused a generall neglect in followinge the publique businies, wch otherwise might have ?ceeded to the effect here intended. Now att the Arrivall here of Captaine Argall in ye form9 parte of the yeare 1619: when Sr Edwin Sandys was Treasuror The Counsell after some time ?ceeded to ye examina?on of the said Captaine havinge wthdrawne himselfe from due tryall in the parts wher ye ffacts were Co?itted and where the true proofs on both sides were to be readilie had. Here howe hee was patronized by ye saide Earle and by Sr Nathaniell Rich to ye hindrance of ye Course of Iustice and of due restitu?on; how the Treasuror was wronged in ?forminge his office and oath and sought to be [294] deterred even by threats of bloud from acquaintinge ye LLs of his Mats: most honobe Pryvy Counsell wth the Colonyes complainte of that Rovinge Ship the Treas- uror, shalbe here passed ouer and referred to any other place. Butt by these meanes the matter was drawne to soe extreame length and the Counsell and Company soe extreamly weryed that in fine Capt Argall goinge the Voyadge to Argier all further ?secu?on hath been since susspended and the Compa: defrauded of ye great restitu?on wch after soe great wronge they had great reason to expect. ffrom wch time the saide Earle and Sr Nathaniell Rich wth others his Lops: fol- lowers have generally absented them selves from the Courts of the Company and other meetings in Counsell, And the said Earle and Sr Nathaniell Rich to- gether wth Sr Thomas Smith haue allsoe sould awaie their Adventures in the ?ticuler Planta?on wherof they were. In the meane time the Company hath continued in a Constant Tenor of great peace and tranquillytie pursuing ye buisines of the Planta?on wth great zeale and industry and that wthout inter- rup?on by any shaddowe of ffac?on till this last great rent wherof shalbe spoken in a more proper place. ffor now to take a veiwe allso of the like ?ceedings for the Sum?er Ilands The Company therof beinge vnwillinge from the begininge that the saide Earle or any other great ?sonn should grow too greate in the saide Ilands;—(haveinge great cause to feare the same) had obteyned yt in his Mats ?res Patents, itt should be lymited that no one Adventurer might be owner ?of1 1 The word "of" written over "in" by Collingwood, the reviewer. ? aboue fifteen shares in the said Ilands amountinge vnto about the Twentieth ?t of the Land there. And that no matter of importance touchinge the state of the said Ilands should be ordered butt in one of their great Quarter Courts to be held in the ffower Tearmes when in likely hood the most principall and greatest number of the Adventurers would be present: These clauses of restrainte beinge no way pleasinge as itt seemeth to his Lop: as beinge opposite to the mayne ends ?iected by his ffollowers a course was taken in the time of Sr Thomas Smiths Gouerment to finde fault wth the ?res Patents vppon ?tence of other defect? and an order of Courte gotten for drawinge of a new Patent to be ?cured from his Maty: vppon surrender of the former, and the care of drawinge itt was co?ended to one mr Phesant a Councellor att Law belonginge to his Lop: and vppõ whome hee had bestowed either really or titularly one [295] of his Shares in the So?er Ilands. This new Patent beinge drawne and a time appoynted for readinge itt to the Company, vppon notice of some suspi?on that ther was no good meaninge in itt ther happened to be some present who seemed were not looked for as haveinge of a longe time forborne those Courts. The con- clusion was that in this new intended Patent, the Institu?on of Qu: Courtes and lymytacon of number of shares were cleane o?itted wch beinge discouered the new draught was reiected and the Company well armed against the like attempt in future times. There remayned as itt seemeth for supply to their desires that his Lop should yett be soe strengthned in ye Courtes att home and soe powerfull by his Agents in those Ilands abrode that all things might be disposed of by their absolute pleasure. ffor the Courts att home besides other his ffollowers wch did the like; His Lop: was allsoe induced to putt of divers of his ffifteene Shares to Sundry new personns amongst wch were Capt Argall and a Brother of Capt: Butlers. By wch means in that small Courte they have ingreatned their power. And as for the Colony itt selfe hee ?cured his ffollower and ffauourite Capt Butler to be chosen Gouernor duringe these last three years who strengthning himselfe by the Associa?on of a Turbulent and ill affected ?sonn, one mr Lewis Hughes a Mynister (who had preached in the Su?er Ilands that the Gouer- ment of ye Church of England by Bishops was Antichristian and that the Booke of Common prayers was butt an Old wiues tale, fitt to be read by ye fireside as was iustified to his face): What course they tooke to alienate the Inhabitants hearts from the Compa: &amp; from the Gouermt therof established here by his Maty: &amp; what oppressions were exercised ouer ?ticularr ?sons appeareth as in ?t by other good proofes, soe partly by ye multitude of per- ticular complaintes against ?the sd? Capt Butler wherof ther shalbe considera- ?on taken had elsewhere in his due place one onely example shalbe here ?duced. In the latter time that Capt Kendall was Deputy Gouernor there arryved att the Summer Ilands (vizt. in ye year 1619) A man of warr wth a Comission from ye Prince of Orange by vertue wherof hee had taken certaine Negros in the West Indies: And beinge in great extremity for want of water and Victuall and forbid by Capt Kendall to com into any of the said Harbors, hee gave him notice [296] that hee had ffourteen Negroes abourd wch if hee should be forced to cast ouer bord for want of Victuall and wather desired to bestow them vppon Capt Kendall for any small considera?on wch hee should be pleased to give him: wch was ?formed accordinglie: Captaine Kendall who had spent a long time in the Summer Ilands beinge one of ye first Inhabitants and who for his valour and other good carriadge had been in time of Vacancy twice chosen Gouernor, Now vppon ye Arrivall of Capt Butler was forcibly by him depryved of all his said Negros vppon ?tence that they belonged vnto the Earle of Warwicks Shipp called the Treasuror wth wch the said Holland man of Warre had consorted, This outrage of ?by? Captaine Butler Vppon ye Goods of his ?discessor so contrary to all Lawe and forme of Iustice and with- out any order for ought euer appeared, enforced Capt Kendall to returne into England and to exhibite his Complainte to the Company against Captaine Butler, wher itt pleased the said Earle to make claime in open Courte, that the said Negroes were his, as belonginge vnto his Ship the Treasuror afore- said, And to crosse Capt: Kendall in his iust Demaund certaine Articles of Complainte were exhibited against him wthout author to advow them, and wthout wittness to proue them wch beinge referred vnto examyna?on in the Su?er Ilands where hee that did him wronge was allso to bee his Iudge was the cause that for a longe while hee gott noe restitution About Mid sommer 1622 the Court takinge considera?on of the wrong done to Captaine Kendall; and the Earle of Warwick referringe his Claime to the Iudgment of the Courte, itt was ordered that Nyne of the same Negroes should be deliuered to Capt Kendall, and the rest to be consigned to ye Companies vse wch the new Gouernor Capt Bernard lately deceased was required by his Instruc?ons to ?see? putt in execu?on. After whose decease by a ?re ther ?duced as from the said Earle importinge that the said Negroes should not be deliuered vnto the said Kendall and vppon advantage taken of mistakinge the Hollanders name, the said restitution is still deferred and the poore gentleman still lan- guisheth vnder the effects of most vniust oppression; Soe weake are the Com- panies orders in that Planta?on if they come once to be countermaunded by any mandate from his Lop: Butt to returne to the conclusion of Capt Butlers Gouerment who ?ceivinge by the multitude of Complaintes against him that hee had incurred some Dis- pleasure wth the Company and as itt seemed vppon iust feare that a Comission would be awarded to the new Gouernor and others for the examyninge of his ?ceedings aboute the last ?late? Spanish Wrack there so much complayned of and for other misdemeanors wherwth hee stood heavilie charged [297] whether in revenge therof or in pursuite of the aforesaid ends he entred into combi- na?on wth the said mr Lewis Hughes and some other fitt Instruments for such a purpose to make a collection of certaine Greivances to be exhibited to the Inhabitants against the Company and withall for a peti?on to the ?s of ye Company first and afterward to the Kinge for alteringe the Gouerment of the Company here as beinge Antimonarchicall, and for ye reducinge itt into the hands of a few principall personns. This done and beinge laden itt seems wth wealth and mallice contrary to a solemne order by himselfe enacted, and to ye desire of the Inhabitants by the help of a small Ship provided to fetch him away from the Summer Ilands (as the same had been done vppon the like occasion for Capt Argall from Virginia) hee was conveyed thence a little before the new Gouernors Arrivall and soe deliuered from the tryall intended by the said Comission, Leavinge those Ilands wth the Inhabitants in a most myserable plight. Butt Capt Butler (as itt seemeth) not satiated wth his wrong to that Planta?on and to the Company heer for ye same goeth from thence to Virginia to be revenged allsoe on ye other Company for that other Planta?on consistinge in great part of the selfe same ?sonns. To Virginia hee came in an ill season of the yeare towardes the extremity of Winter, and in a worse time otherwise after the late Massacre where beinge refused to sitt in Counsell wth them, wherto hee could shewe no right though otherwise entertayned wth very great courtesie, hee fedd his eyes wth the mis- erable spectacle of a Country ouerrun §wth§1 1 Written over "&amp;" by the copyist. a late Treacherous warr, wch in a harte of any sence of mortall Calamytie would have wrought though not a Christian yett an humaine Compassion. Butt hee soone after returrninge into England, and findinge the Companies full of trouble by some ffactious Spirites and that enquyrie was allredie made, and some reasonable Discouery of his vnthankfull practise and conspiracie in the said Summer Ilands to deprive them of that Gouerment, by whome and by wch himselfe was made Gouernor means was found by some of the aforesaid Instru- ments that hee should be brought vnto ye Kinge and co?aunded as is said to make vnto his Maty: a true Relation of the State of Virginia, wch Relation termed by himselfe an Vnmaskinge of Virginia and consistinge of an extreame disgraceinge of that Country &amp; Planta?on together wth a moste bitter aspersion vppon [298] the Gouerment therof both there and here, how farr itt is in all materiall poyntes from truth, hath soe fully appeared by vndenyable proofe as that impudencie itt selfe cannot open mouth to excuse itt. In fine these disguised Accons beinge vnmasked they now playnly professe, Sr Nathaniell Rich in the Courte his Brotherinlawe Sr Thomas Wroth att the Counsell Board Alderman Iohnson in his Petition to his Matie, Capt Butler in his Dismaskinge and others by other means some of them in one parte and some of them in another yt they desire an altera?on of the Gouerment in both Companies; wherby as may be very stronglie presumed (comparinge their former ?ceedings wth the present) to drawe the Planta?ons into their former Estate of beinge Subiects vnto their Ambition and inexpleable avarice. In the meane time their practises and labours are infinite in disgraceinge wth all kindes of Calumnies &amp; slanders the present Gouerment of the Companies wth their Ac?ons and ?sonns The said Earle allso apparantly (to drawe (itt seemeth) vnto himselfe some showe of a partie) countenancinge and graceinge all kindes of opposites to the Companies vppon what cause ever soe ever, and though hertofore sundry of them noe less opposite allsoe to his Lop: And vnder ?tence of iustifyinge those their manyfold vntruthes they have sued for a Comission to examine those Imputa?ons wherwth they have been pleased to charge the Gouerment in these fower last years. Wch Comission by his Mats grace and the Lords noble Iustice ordayned to extend allso to ye Twelue years of the former Gouermt, and the Companies ernestly pressinge them to take out their Comission they have still delayed and doe delay the same knowinge (as itt seemeth) in their owne guilty consiencies that they are neither in any degree able to charge the latter nor yett to excuse ye former Gouer- ment. This Remonstrance of the strange and longe continued ?ceedings of the Instru- ments afore saide, ye said Counsell and principall Assistants haue thought fitt to gather into one bodie, and soe to offer itt to ye veiwe and Iudgment of the generall Court? beinge a matter of the highest importance yt ever came into their considera?ons, as concerninge not a fewe Branches, butt the very Bodies lyfe and subsistence of both the Planta?ons and Companie.

Where- vpon the Court being putt to ye question, It was by a generall erec?on of hand? (saue ffiue only) approued to be rightly sett downe. The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Company, that whereas ye Court held ye Nyneteenth of ffebruary Last, did recomend to a select Comittee the drawing vp into the ?a? forme of lawes certaine orders then made touchings Mens admission to haue Voic? in the Court?, as also concerning the nomina?on of Comittees for perticuler businesses; the Comittees hauing mett, had drawne vp ye said Lawes &amp; presented them to the Counsell; who approuing of them, desired they might be brought to this Court according to the Lawe; Wherevpon was read this Lawe following, An order touching ye admitting of men to haue Voice in Court. To auoid the bringing in hereafter of disorderly and vnworthy [303] persons to haue Voice in Court, It is ordered, that noe man shalbe admitted into the Courts, but in this manner, first his name shalbe openly proposed in some Court, that ye Company may take notice or consider of him or make such enquiry as they shall thinke fitt; Then afterward in ye next or any other Court (if be noe iust excep?on be taken to him, other orders of ye Company being also obserued, he may be admitted; If excep?on be taken, the same shalbe tryed by the same or some other Court; If ye party appeale it shalbe tryed in a Quarter Court.

(onely ffiue hand? excepted) approued of and ordered to be reco?ended to the Quarter Court for a full confirma?on to stand as a Lawe and order of the Company. And whereas it was moued herevpon, that the like caution might be taken of those, that were admitted to be of ye Counsell; It was held to be a most necessary Proposition, and fitt to be hereafter taken into considera?on, though now it could not be passed by reason of ye neere approach of ye Quarter Court. Next were read the orders touching the naming of Extraordinary Comittees, viztt. Orders touching the naming of extraord: Comittees. To auoid all confusion in naming of Comittees extraordinary, It is ordered that noe one man may name aboue one Comittee, except the Treasuror who may name two and ye Deputy in his absence; yet noe man shalbe permitted to name any Comittee, if ye matter comitted concerne himselfe. If exception be taken to any person soe named, it shalbe decided by question in ye Court. But if ye matter comitted be of great importance, the Court shall pro- ceed in this manner; The nomber of Comittees shalbe first agreed on by ye one Court, the one halfe shalbe first named by the Treasuror, Deputy and Counsell, and the other halfe by the Gennerality, obseru- ing ye order last before.

As for the security and indempnity of mr Iohn fferrar for the mony for wch he stood bound, the Auditors presented the draft of a security. Wch being read was well approued, and ordered to be engrossed &amp; passed in ye Quarter Court, being as followeth (viztt)1 1 This security is in the autograph of Thomas Collett. (?) Whereas itt appeareth by the testimony of the Auditors and Comittes of ye Com- pany for Virginia vnder their hand writinge bearinge date the twelfth of May 1623 that Iohn fferrar hath payd into the hand? of ye Right Honoble: Henry Earle of Southampton Treasuror of ye Company ye some of Three hundred and Twenty pounds taken vpp by him ye said Iohn fferrar of the Lady Rumny and mr Thomas Mellinge in May last past in the year 1622 wherof Two hun- dred pounds was by order and entreaty of ye Quarter Court for to make pro- visions for the buildinge of the fforte intended by Captaine Each and other was for discharge and payment of divers due and lawfull Debts from ye Com- pany approved by the Auditors and Comittees the interest of wch monneys haveinge been payd vntill this present twelth of May 1623 out of the Compa- nies Cash ye principall yett remaynes vnsattisfied and mr Iohn fferrar still engaged vnto ye said ?seuerall? ?ties aforenamed for the said sume of 320li: Now for ye Securitie and indempnyty of ye said Iohn fferrar and for the pay- ment and sattisfac?on of ye said sume of 320li together wth all ye interest and damages that shall arise therby; Itt is ordered and agreed that all such goods &amp; Comodities as shalbe returned from Virginia belonginge to ye generall body of the Company shalbe from time to time consigned and deliuered into the hands of the said Iohn fferrar to be by him sold and disposed of vntill the said some of 320li shalbe fully payd and discharged together wth all the Interest and damages yt shall arise therby, And for the farther securitie of ye said Iohn fferrar, It is ?likewise? farther ordered and agreed yt it shalbe lawfull for the said Iohn fferrar to receaue and take to his owne vse all such monneys and Debts as are and shalbe due vnto ye Compa: from any whomsoeuer &amp; hee ye said Io: fferrar can ?cure vntill such time as hee be fully sattisfied and dis- charged of ye said ?some of? 320li: together wth all the Interest and damages yt shall arise therby: And it is ordered &amp; agreed yt ye Acquittances and Releases of ye said Io: fferrar shalbe a sufficient discharge vnto all such as shall pay him any monnys vntill the aforesaid Debt be fully paid &amp; discharged: And in con- firma?on of ye ?mises ye Compa: for Virginia beinge assembled in a great and generall Qu: Court held for Virginia ye fourteenth day of May 1623 have hervnto caused their legall Seall to be affixed. ?Sealed in the ?senc of me Ed. Collingwood Secre? Sr Edwin Sandis signifyed, that at the end of his yeare ?of? being Treasuror, he presented his Account for that yeare, audited and approued of. And whereas he continued afterward still their Treas- uror, till the end of Midsomer terme following, he had likewise per- fected the remayne of his Account for that tyme, and being allowed by the Auditors; he presented the same heretofore vnto ye Court, wch hath since Layen open at euery Court and noe excep?on taken thereat; He therefore moued that according to ye orders of ye Company, he might haue his Quietus est this next Quarter Court. Which the Court generally held fitt should be graunted, and ordered the same to be giuen him accordingly. It was Likewise thought fitt &amp; ordered, that for ye Two yeares formerly past, the Earle of Southampton should haue his Quietus est; [306] but for this Last yeare, it should be respited till the next terme, because the Account was to lye open at each Court, betweene this and then, by the orders of the Company, for any man to pervse and take excep- ?on if any error could be found. Vpon mo?on it was Likewise thought fitt &amp; ordered, that mr Iohn fferrar according to order should haue his Quietus est this next Quarter Court, his Account? being long since audited &amp; approued of, &amp; often brought vnto ye Court to be pervsed. Sr Iohn Dãuers moued, that whereas one mr Okely Secr? to ye Lo: Keeper hath taken much paynes in dispatching diuers ?res, that his Lord was pleased to write at the Companies request vnto certen per- sons indebted to ye Company, being ready still to doe the Company that seruice; that therefore some gratifica?on might be giuen him for his paynes. Which mo?on the Court thought very fitting &amp; promised considera?on should be had thereof, assoone as mony came into ye Companies Cashe. The Lord Cauendish moued, that whereas mr Newton hath taken much paynes in warning the Court? euer since mr Carter Left the place, he might therefore be proposed at this next Quarter Court for ye Beadles place for this yeare ensuing; wch the Court generally agreed vnto. Mr Deputy acquaynted the Court, that Wedensday next was the vsuall day of elec?on, and in reguard the Earle of Sout?tons three yeares were expired, they should doe well to take to their considera?on the choice of some Noble &amp; worthy person to succeed him; wherevpon diuers named the Lo: Cauendish, and diuers others named ye Lo: Pagett. The Court taking into their considera?on the offer of ye Lord Treas- uror touching the ffarming of the Spanish Tobacco (about wch they were now to come to some speedy resolu?on) &amp; finding the same could not otherwise be vndertaken, but by priuate Aduenturers (the Com- pany hauing noe Stock) After a serious debate and consulta?on herevpon, it was at length1 1 Written over "lenght." agreed &amp; ordered, that to giue a begining to this busines, a Preamble should be forthwith drawne by a Comittee appointed by this Court, whereby to invite men to an vnderwriting toward? a Ioint stock, vpon such condi?ons as ye said Comittee should thinke fitt. And touching the yearely rent of 6000li demaunded for this farme of Spanish Tobacco, it was thought fitt to respite the con- cluding hereof, vntill they had tryed to what some they could bring the Roll Vnto, and then the Vndertakers to treat wth ye Lo: Treasuror [307] about it, &amp; driue their owne bargaine as good cheape as they cann; ffor drawing vp the aforesayd Preamble, the Court appointed mr Gibbs mr Wolstenholme mr Bennett mr Bland mr Withers mr Scott mr Barbor mr Ditchfield mr Caning mr Palmer mr Moorer to meete too morrow morning about it. The Lo: Cauendish acquaynted the Company, that whereas at their being before ye ?s on ffriday last, they were appointed to attend their Lops vpon ye next ffriday; he had this day receaued another warning, that they are to attend them too morrowe in ye Afternoone: Where- fore he wished the Company to take notice hereof, and not to faile to be there about Two of ye Clock &amp; to meete together in ye Stone Gallery. Mr Iohn Newport moued, that whereas his father Capt Christopher Newport had vnder the seale of ye Counsell ffoure hundred pounds allowed him for his Aduenture in Shares of Land to ye nomber of Thirty two shares, that the said shares might be confirmed vnto him, being his only sonne and heire, as also such Personall shares as are due vnto him for ye transport of men heretofore, or that hereafter he shall transport at his owne charge. Wch request the Court hath graunted vnto him: and to this purpose there being a draft of a Pat- tent presented &amp; read; the same was approued and ordered to be engrossed against the Quarter Court. Sr Iohn Dauers propounded the admission of ye Lo: Bruice into the Company and Counsell, who had of late shewed a great good affec?on to ye busines of ye Planta?on &amp; Company. Wch ye Court very willingly consented vnto, &amp; ordered to be recomended to ye Quarter Court. It was Likewise moued that mr Tomlins &amp; mr White, being Gentle- men that had with Long &amp; continuall dilligence attended the Court? might then also be proposed to be admitted of ye Counsell. Mr Deputy propounded ye passing of Ten shares to one mr Iohn Burgh from Peter Humble the sonne &amp; heire of Richard Humble deceased, who had Eight shares by his owne Aduenture &amp; two others as Execu- tor to his Sister the wife of Raple Harrison deceased, whose Executrix shee was, they bothe dying issueles, &amp; ye said Richard Humble being ye imediate heire. Mr Deputy likewise propounded ye passing of One share from mr Bland to mr Robert Edward?. [308]</field>

The Preparative Courte of ye 12th of §this§ Month was read and by a generall erec?on of hands (no one dissentinge) approved to be right- lie sett downe. In reguard the Earle of Southampton had not as yett fully ended his three years Gouerment before the next Quarter Court: the Courte humbly besought his Lop: to continue the place of Treasuror vntill the next Quarter Courte: Wch his Lop yeilded vnto itt was by a gen9all erec?on of handes ordered yt the elec?on for this day should be sus- pended and his §lp§ continued till ye next Quarter Courte.

This mo?on was well approved &amp; held to be verie waightie and important, butt the Court not conceivinge how such an Order could generally be observed in respect divers Ships sett outt some from the West partes others outt of Ireland, have referred itt to the considera?on of a Co?ittee. (vizt) mr Deputy. mr Robert?. mr Kirby. mr Cuffe. mr Bynge. mr Procter. mr Webb. mr Rider. Who are appoynted to meet at mr Deputies to morrow being Thursday about 4: in the after noone to Consider what good order or ?vision might be made therin and how itt might be putt in execution that such as goe in ?sonn or shall otherwise transport anie Passengers thither doe ?vide and carry with them such a due proporcon of Victuall and other necessaries as are ?ticularly sett downe in the printed Bill Wch the Company haue heretofore published. The Owners of the Abigall made request they might be paide the monneys due vnto them for fraight accordinge to their Charter party in regard they were ernestly called vppon by the marriners to dis- charge their wages: Whervppon mr Deputy informed the Court howe vnexpectedlie the Companies Designes had been frustrated and a great damage com vppon them, of payinge a great Sum of mony in regard that ther was not as hee vnderstood aboue 6000 waight of Tobacco returned wheras ther should haue been att the least 30000 by the Companies Contract att 3d the pound: Whervppõ the Company is to make vpp the rest Wch although by ye Generall letter the Gouernor and Counsell doe promise [322] the next year to see paide and dis- charged and the Company reimbursed, yett itt came now most vnfortunately and greiuously. As for the Demaunds of the Owners hee signified that they required as much as if the fforte had been builded pretendinge they were deteyned soe longe as if they should have been to doe itt. The Court seeinge two questionns first what was due, Secondlie how itt should be sattisfied did appoynt the Comittees followinge together wth two of the Auditors to take the seuerall poynt? into their Consid- era?on and to make report therof to the Preparatiue Courte that such course might be taken therin as may be agreeable to right and equitie. The Owners of the Abigall further Acquainted the Court that wheras they vnderstood a great part of the beer, was bad and such as had likelie much endamaged the peoples health that, that Beer was bought of mr Dupper, who had received of them a great price for itt: Wher- fore as well for the Cleeringe of their Inocencie as allso for the iust sattisfac?on of the world they purposed to Complaine either to the Comissioners or the ?s of the Counsell in cause the Company had not sufficient authorytie of themselvs to ?ceed against mr Dupper desyringe yt the Company would be pleased to take the matter into their serious Considera?on and to ioyne Wth them as well for the pre- ventinge of the like hereafter as allso that as the Company had the greatest ?t in the Damage so they might iustly expect in the restitu- ?on: The Court conceivinge the matter very waightie and by no means to be passed ouer did referr itt to the Counsell to advise what course were fittest to be held and to ?ceed theron accordinglie either before the ?s: of the Counsell or the Comissionors. Mr Deputie moved yt wheras the Somer Iland? Court att their last Court appoynted a Co?ittee to advise and consider about the manner of entringe the orders of Court? (vizt) whether itt be necessarie to men?on their names that shall make any mo?on or proposi?on in Court. Hee moved the like considera?on might be hadd touchinge ye Orders of Court? for this Company whervppon the Court recomended itt to the care of the former Comittee addinge some few others vnto them viz. Ea: of Warwick. Sr Lawrence Hide. Lo: Cauendish. mr Gibbes. Lo: De Lawarr. mr Nicho: fferrar. Sr Sam: Sandys. mr Rider or any 4: Sr Io: Dauers. Who are desired to meet abou att mr Deputies ?about it? to morrow beinge Thursday aboute 5 in the Afternoone. [323] And wheras itt was likewise informed yt divers mrs in Virginia doe much neglect and abuse their servant? there with intollerable oppres- sion and hard vsage the former Comittee are desyred to advise and consider of the best course they cann how theise greevances and abuses may be redressed and reformed. The widdow Smalleys peti?on was read and a draught of ye Companies answere ther vnto wch the Court approved and by a generall erec?on of hands ordered to be deliuered to the Comissioners on Satterday next. The Right Honõble the Lord De Lawarr signified yt Capt Brewster haueinge by chance broken the Seale yt was affixed to his acquittall from ye vniust sentence of condempnation by Capt Argall in the Mar- shalls Court in Virginia and beinge to ?sent the same to his Maty: did make request itt might be sealled wth a new Seale Wch request the Court takinge into consideration did rather thinke fitt to graunt him a Duplycate therof itt beinge vsuall (and denyed to no man) to take Duplycates of Patents vnder ye great Seale of England. Edward Downes peticoned that his sonne Richard Downes haveinge continued in Virginia these 4 years, who ?and? beinge bred a scholler went ouer in hope of preferment in the Colledge there; might now be sett free to live there of himselfe ?and haue shares of land to plant vpon? The Court conceivinge this Court §Suite§ to be verie reasonable haue recomended the graunt therof to the next Quarter Courte. Mr Withers haveinge a share passed vnto him att the last Court &amp; ?nowe againe? ?pounded (wherat no excep?on beinge taken) was admitted.</field>

Whervppon the Quarter Court held the 14th of May last was Read wherat no excep?on beinge taken itt was putt to the question and by a generall erec?on of hand? approved to be rightlie sett downe. Next was Read the Court held the 17th of May wch in like manner was by a generall erec?on of hand? approved to be rightly sett downe. Next the Court held the 24th of May was read and by a generall erec- ?on of hands approved to be rightly sett downe. Lastly the Court held the 18 of Ivne was read and by a gennerall erec?on of hands approved to be rightlie sett downe. The Comittee concerninge Passengers haveinge brought their opynions to this Court in writinge the same was read: Butt the Courte vppon further debate fyndinge many difficulties to arise aboute the execu?on therof (wherin they desyred to be better sattisfied) haue reco?itted the same againe to the former Co?ittee addinge vnto them mr Morer mr Whitley and mr Withers to take itt into farther considera?on to see if they cann ?pose some feazible way how such a course may be taken as to cause all Passengers that goe to Virginia be well furnished Wth Provisions accordinge to the published Declaration: The said Comittee are likewise to Consider how the abuses complayned of toward? servants in Virginia may be reformed. Sr Edward Sackuill moved yt the Earle of Southampton might haue his Quietus est for his three years Accompt? accordinge to order and as was ordered att the last Quarter Courte, his saide Accompt? for the two former years haveinge duly layen open in Courte audited and approved of Wth out excep?on; And this latter years Accompt allsoe haveinge layen in ye Co?issioners hands for any man to ?vse that will &amp; noe excep?on taken thervnto. Touchinge wch the Court beinge well sattisfied and conceivinge itt was most due and fitt his Lop: should haue his Quietus est ordered ther- vppon the same to be drawne vpp against the Quarter Courte. [325] Itt was likewise moved yt in regard mr Deputy fferrars Accompt for ye year past was presented att the last Court Audited and approved both by the Auditors and Comittees and beinge since that time deliu- ered vpp to his Mats: Co?issioners hath there layen open for any man that pleased to ?vse And seeinge no excepcon hath been taken there- vnto in all this time that therfore hee might allsoe haue his Quietus est accordinge to order and as was ?mised att the last Quarter Court, Wch the Court accordingly graunted vnto him, orderinge the same to be drawne vpp againste the Quarter Courte. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that the Auditors and Comittee appoynted to treat wth the Owners of the Abigall had mett beinge assisted with divers others of the Company and especially by Sr Edward Sackvill and haveinge taken into ?their? Considera?on the two point? referred vnto them by the last Court namely what was due to the said Owners, &amp; Secondly how itt should be payd; Doe finde yt by the Charter party theris Due vnto them for fraight of goods outward belonginge to the Generall Compa: after the rate of 3li ? Tunn—16 102li: And they finde likewise by the plaine and express words of the Charter party the Company was bound to make their ffraight home- ward 400li although the fforte were not built by them: Wch the Compa: did adventure to doe vppon assurance of ladinge 30000: waight of Tobacco att 3d ? pound wch was never once doubted there could be any faylinge in, consideringe that divers Years heretofore the Colony hath vppon the Companies order laden farr greater quantities abourd the Ships appoynted from hence: Butt what by the Calamities of the year and what by the negligence and defaut of the people who brought not in the quantities of Sassa- phras ?Wch? they were enioyned to doe, to haue therby made supply of ye former defect the Ship was returned home with out ?only? about 5000: waight of Sassaphras and betwixt 6: and seaven thousand waight of Tobacco wch att 3d ? pound would not com to aboue 80li sterlinge: Soe yt the fraight would fall short of what the Comp was bound to pay them homeward 320li or ther about? toward? all which ther was nothinge sent butt a Small quantytie of Saxafras, And although by the generall letter the Gouernor and Counsell doe ?mise &amp; binde themselvs to make full sattisfac?on and reimburse this charge to the Company yett the Co?ittee did conceaue the Company not a little wronged in the not ?formance therof especially consideringe the great quantitie wch was sent to Holland wherout they conceived there should haue been made a good allowance toward? the Defrayinge of this Charge. Butt howsoeuer the Colony had broken wth the Company, ye Company might not doe soe wth those wth whome they had contracted vnder their seall To whome there appeared due wth out contradiction or denyall 420li presupposinge allwaies that the Tobacco returned home was but 6500: waight as the Purser had deliuered and offereth to maynteyne by oath, ffor §if§ there shalbe found any more to be brought home the Owners are to receaue 3d for every pound and so much is to be Deducted from the Companies Debt. [326] As for the farther Demaund of the Owners of the Abigall who say yt by the authority and power of the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia they were deteyned vntill the last day yt they were bound to stay in case they had gone forward wth the Forte and thervppon Demaunded sattisfaccon of 160li: ? monneth accordinge as their Charter ?ty express- eth they should haue in case they were deteyned longer then Aprill: The Comittee conceaved that in case itt shalbe sufficiently proved that the said Ship and Marriners were deteyned as they ?tended that then theris sattisfaction to be made them from the Colony accordingly as was Covenanted in the Charter ?ty: Butt in regard that the Marriners to whose benifitt the ?tractinge of Voyadges cheifly conduceth are not sufficient wittness and yt the Company haue no reason to thinke that the Gouernor &amp; Counsell would soe vnadvisedlie deteyne a Ship of such charge to no purpose butt doe rather conceive that itt was the Marriners negligence or other default that kept them there so longe— They therfore thinke fitt to Referr this matter vnto examination in Virginia especially consideringe that the payment is to be raysed from them there. The Court after much Dispute and Debate vppon those pointes in the end agreed and consented vnto the Report of ye Comittees and their iudgment (vizt) that vppon the premises theris due vnto the Owners 420li: And yt if vppon examination in Virginia itt be found yt they were deteyned longer then they ought to haue been by the Colony that then further sattisfac?on should be made them by the Colony ?porconably to the time wch they were detayned more. As for the payment of the Debt of 420li wch appeared due itt was ordered that the Saxaphras should be sould by mr Webb and mr Cuffe and the ?ceed therof paid vnto the Owners in ?t of Discharge of this Debt and yt the rest should be payd vnto them assoone as monneys came in and for their further sattisfac?on that they should haue such securitie given vnto them as was vnto mr Iohn fferrar, (vizt) yt itt should be lawfull for them, to receaue such Debts Due vnto the Com- pany as they could procure in till they were sattisfied and yt after the Discharge of the Companies bond to mr Iohn fferrar all such goods should be returned from Virginia belonginge to the Generall Company should be consigned vnto them for payment of what should be due vnto them. Lastly itt was ordered yt by the next dispatch into Virginia their should be letters addressed vnto the Colony in the Companies name requyringe sattisfac?on to be made this next yeare [327] of the former su?e together wth all the rest of the charge the Company were att concerninge the fforte and yt itt should be signified that the Compa: conceaue itt iust that those who are §for§ a greater advantage vnto themselves did send their Tobacco to Holland, should bear a large propor?on consideringe they vndergoe much less charges then they that sent theirs home. The Owners of ye Abigall earnestly moved that some speedy course might be taken against Dupper ye Bruer for his bad condi?oned Beer soe much complayned of: wch the Court takinge into Considera?on itt was att length thought fitt that before they ?ceeded against him hee be first spoken wthall that they may know what answere hee cann make to this his charge Wch Course beinge well approved the Court entreated mr Deputy mr Withers and mr Widdowes to goe to mr Dupper and talke wth him about itt and bringe his answer to the Quarter Courte yt accordingly the Company may resolue how to ?ceed against him. Sr Iohn Dauers signified that the Counsell haveinge taken into their considera?on that although there be many worthy Cittizens of the Counsell, yett either through busines or otherwise they doe not give that diligent attendance as the Actions of the Planta?ons requires And since the Nobillytie and gentry are most of them absent in the Vaca- tion when yett divers waighty and vrgent busisnesses happen The Counsell therfore in Supply therof haue thought fitt that fower should be Chosen of the Counsell such as their continuall lyvinge in Towne doth ?mise they wilbe verie carefull of the buisiness wch they haue as pryvate members Dilligently followed and thervppon ?pounded mr George Scott, mr Iohn Bland } Cittizens mr Tho: Whitley mr Berblock gen? Whervppon itt was by erec?on of hands ordered yt they should be reco?ended to the Quarter Courte to be chosen of his Mats: Counsell. A mo?on was made in the behalfe of Capt Bargraue that aswell in regaurd of his longe attendance and sufficiencie as allso for that hee had spent a good ?t of his estate to advance the Planta?on in Virginia hee might therfore haue that favour afforded him as to succeed Sr William Nuce de?eased in the place of Marshall of Virginia, wch mo?on and request the Courte thought fitt to referr to the further Considera?on of the Counsell. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that hee hadd receaued from his Mats: Comissioners a Peti?on of mr Wrotes concerninge his standinge bound for the Companies sute against Wye: wch beinge read mr Dep- uty acquainted the Court wth the State of the buisines how that ther was liberty for a yeare and a day to sue out the Appeall that itt was thertofore ?hitherto? Deferred in reguard that Wye himselfe is absent and the five Suerties [328] that hee putt in, all come behinde hand, soe yt as itt would be a certaine charge to sue out the Appeale soe itt could be to no purpose ye ?tie beinge absent: Wherfore since ther was yett 6 monneths time to doe itt in, the Advocates and Proctor did advise ye Company not to sturr therin butt to expect Wyes returne wch if itt did not happen duringe that terme they were of opynion that vppõ soe iust ground the benifitt of the Appeale could not be taken from the Company. Last of all hee said that their opinion was that howsoeuer itt should happen that no Damadge could arise aboue 20 nobles att ye moste for the Iudge had onely dismissed the sute without any damadge saveinge the charges wch hee reserved to himselfe, to tax his answere the Courte ordered shall be drawne vpp and ?sented to the Comissioners and wth all yt itt should be signified that ther on mr Bearblock yt stood bound §together§ wth him, and that there should be sufficient provi- sion made to save them harmeless. Vppon mo?on order was given for drawinge vpp two Patents the one for mr Iohn Zouch and his Associates the other for mr Iohn Prynn of London Marchant. Vppon the like mo?on order was given for Drawinge vpp a Comission for the Trueloue of 50 Tunn wherof Iames Carter is ordeyned mr for Transporta?on of Passengers to Virginia and after for a fishinge Voyadge.</field>

[329] Iames R.˜ Right Trustie and welbeloued: Wee greet you well: forasmuch as wee haue appointed a Co?ission to examine the present estate of the Virginia Plantation with sundrie other things and matters appertayninge therevnto and that wee expect within these fewe dayes to haue some Accompt made vs of their laboures in that seruice: Vnderstandinge that to morrowe beinge the 25th of this moneth; yo intend to hold a Court for the said Company: Our will and pleasure is that you do forbeare the elec?on of any Officers vntill to morrowe fortnight at the soonest, but to let those that be already remayne as they are, in the meane time Giuen at our Court at Greenwitch the fower &amp; Twentith day of Iune in the one &amp; twentith yeare of our Raigne of great Brittaine Fraunce and Ireland. ?Directed To ye right trusty and welbeloued the T?er Counsell and Company of virginia?1 1 A copy of this letter is in the Public Record Office, Manchester Papers, No. 380. The manuscript is similar to one of the copyists of the Court Book. See List of Records, No. 525, Vol. I, page 177, ante. Wch Letter beinge read after a longe and generall silence in the Court, it was at length taken into considera?on, whither by the Kings Let- ters Patents the Companie had power to make their elec?on in any other but a Quarter Court: Wherevpon the Patent beinge pervsed and that pointe therein duly waighed and examined: It plainely appeared by the verie expresse words of the Patent that the choise of Counsellors and Officers were restrained and lymited to Quarter Court? onely and that although it were without negatiue or exclusiue word?, yet it was conceaued it was imployed in the verie sense thereof in reguard there is sett downe perticulerly what shalbe donne in Inferior Court? and what in Quarter Court?: wch manner of distin?on was con- ceaued could amount to no lesse then a plaine exclusiue: And it was further added that the Custome and vsage of the Companie in their yearely elec?ons haue bin suitable therevnto havinge alwayes chosen their Officers in Quarter Court? onely and not in other Court?.2 2 This phrase reads in the draft among the Ferrar Papers as follows: "and in noe other courts." And it was further taken into considera?on that whereas by the last Quarter Court the Treasuror, Deputie, and other Officers of this Com- panie were to continue in their places but vntill this present Court whereby after this Day if they should not be continued by order of this Court, the Gouerment would become voide and the Companie destitute of Officers to followe and keepe Court? and the Patent also forfeited: It was therefore held fitt, the old Officers should be still continued vntill a newe choise were made. The Court havinge thus declared their opinion and diuers beinge desirous that it might be put to the question, the Secretary was caused by the Court first to sett the question downe in writinge wch was dic- tated vnto him in manner followinge vizt. The Companie of Virginia in obedience to his Maties Letter do this day forbeare their election, and do continue all their Officers till their next Quarter Court, his Matie havinge giuen them power by his Letters Patents to make election in Quarter Courtes only: Wch beinge read and ?so? put to the question the whole Court with one generall and vnanimous consent agreed therevnto noe one dissentinge. Sr Samuell Sandys acquainted the Court that he had receaued a Letter from Sr ffrauncis Wyatt (the present Gouernor) wherein he made request, that he would moue the Companie that aswell in reguard of his great losse since he went to Virginia (beinge out of his estate well neare 1000li) as also in discharge of their owne promise to him (that he should haue his iust number of men belonginge to his office as Gou- ernor) that accordingly therevnto they would please to supplie him very speedily beinge not able otherwise well to subsist wch mo?on and request the Court thought fitt to referre to the considera?on of the Counsell. The Preparatiue Court was nowe read and by a generall erec?on of hand? approued to be rightly sett downe. [330] Next the matters propounded in the said Court were againe moued and passed in manner followinge ffirst the Earle of Southamptons Quietus est for his three yeares Accompt? audited and approued of, extendinge from 28th of Ianuary ?Iune 1620? vntill 25th Iunij 1623 beinge ordered at the last Quarter Court as also in the last Preparatiue Court ?to be drawne vp and brought to this Court? the same was accordinglie donne and nowe presented the Coppie whereof doth here ensue.

Afterward their llps propounded vnto him some other verie waightie proposi?ons: wch his humble request vnto their llps was, might be drawne up into an order of that Bourd that so he might present it vnto the Companie wch their llps were pleased fauourably to condiscend vnto, and havinge sent him the order, he said he need not himselfe speake anythinge, since they should heare most fully from the order it selfe wch was read beinge as followeth. This Day the Deputie and diuers of the Aduenturers and Companie of Virginia were called to the Board, vnto whome their llps declared that his Matie havinge taken into his Princely considera?on the distressed estate of that Colonie and Planta?on occasioned as it seemeth by miscarriage of the Gouermt in that Companie, wch cannot well be remeadied but by reduceinge the Gouermt into the hand? of a fewer number of Gouernors neare to those that were in the first Patents of the1 1 Written over the word "that." said Planta?on, but especially to be prouided that the interest of all Aduenturers and priuate persons whatsoeuer shalbe preserued &amp; continued as they are, hath therefore resolued by a newe Charter to appointe a Gouernor twelue Assistant? resident here in England vnto whome should be co?itted the Gouerment of that Companie and Colonie, wch Gouernor and Assistants his Matie wilbe pleased to nominate and make choise of the first time, and afterward? the elec?on of the Gouernor to be in this manner vizt: The Assistant? to present the names of three to his Matie of whom his Matie wilbe pleased to nominate one to be Gouernor and the Assistant? to be chosen by the greater part of the Gouernors Assistant? for the time being the names of them to be chosen beinge first presented to his Matie or to this Bourd to be allowed or disallowed by his Matie And the Gouernor and six of the Assistant? to be changed thus once in two yeares: And his Matie is pleased that there shalbe resident in Virginia a Gouernor and Twelue Assistant? to be nominated by the Gouernor and Assistant? here resident they pre- sentinge their names to his Matie or this Board that his Matie may allowe or disallowe of the same: And as the Gouernor and Assistant? resident in Virginia shall haue Dependance and rela?on to the Gouernor and Assistants resident here: So the Gouernor and Assistant? here shall haue rela?on and Dependance on this Bourd, whereby all matters of importance may be Directed by his matie at this Bourd: And that in the same Charter his Matie purposeth to make the like graunt? as well of land? as of fraunchises and other benifitt? and thing? as were graunted in the former Charters wth Declara?on that for the setlinge and establishinge of priuate interest? of all men this newe Companie shall confirme or newly graunt vnto them the like interest as they enioy by Graunt order or allowance of the former Companie: And therefore the said Deputy and other of the said Companie were by their [339] Lops required to assemble a Court on Wedensday next therein to resolue whither the Companie wilbe content to submitt and surrender their former Charters and accept of a newe Charter wth the altera?ons aboue men?oned and to returne their Aunsweare wth all expedi?on to this Bourd his Matie beinge Determined in Default of such submission to proceed for the recallinge of the said former Charters in such sort as shalbe iust.

Wch order beinge read three seuerall times the Companie seemed greatly amazed at the Proposition, so as no man spake therevnto for a longe time, At length mr Deputy desired them to bethinke themselues in so waightie a buissines what aunsweare they would giue him to returne with to their Lops wch their Lops would expect vpon ?the? ffriday followinge; Wherevpon it was by diuers one after another aunsweared that the matter was of such consequence and waight as they had noe power to giue aunsweare vnto in this Court beinge but an ordinary Court wch by his Mats Letters Patents are onely enhabled to handle and order casuall and perticuler occurrences and accidentall matters of lesse consequence and waight, but all waightie affaires and perticulerly all things concerning the manner of Gouerment were restrained by precise words in the Letters Patents to the Quarter Court?, wherefore duringe the Patent was in force they might not in this ordinary Court take vpon them any such authority to determine such a matter as this beinge of the highest nature that euer was pro- pounded to them: And herevpon the Letters Patents were called for and found to agree exactly wth what had bin alledged: It was also further alledged howe inviolably and exactly they had alwayes made their practise aunsweareable herevnto not takinge liberty to them- selues so much as to giue a share of land but in a Quarter Court: And further it was alledged that whereas besid? the newe Aduenturers (wch cannot be thought to be lesse then fower or fiue hundred) and all the Planters in Virginia wch are equally enteressed in his Mats graceous Letters Patents there were neare 1000 ?sons named in the Letters Patents themselues to whome the Graunt was made whereof there was not iudged to be thirty present in Court: Wherefore the Companie conceaued themselues euen in conscience bound not so sodainely to passe awaye all their interest? but rather to be humble peti?oners to their Lops vpon these iust ground? that their Aunsweare might be respited vntill the Quarter Court wch was not verie farr of; Against wch time they should haue leasure to con- sider well of so waightie a buissines, And a verie large and generall So?ons might be giuen to all men to appeare then wth perticuler inti- ma?on of the buissines to be Determined to the intent that they might be the rather induced to affoord their presence wch if they did not they should be wthout excuse for euer after complayninge. But some fewe moued that they would rather in conformity to their Lops order presently surrender their Charters and professed themselues very willinge to surrender it: Wherevpon the Court desired mr Deputie to make two Proposi?ons questions according to the two seuerall Proposi?ons.

Mr Deputie acquainted the Court with two thing?, first with the good newes that was come from Virginia by the Shipps lately returned from New-England (where a Pynnace from Virginia arriued before they came away,) and brought diuers perticuler Letters that do import thus much; namely that the Colonie in Virginia haue recouered health, that they were in hope to haue a plentifull haruest of Cane and Tobacco that Opachankano is slaine and as some affirme 150 of his great men and that or English were then goeinge out againe to pursue the rest of them: and to distroy their Corne: wch newes is also confirmed by diuers that came home in the said Shipps and that there was hope they should receaue a more perticuler rela?on hereof by the generall Letter to the Companie that came in the Pacquett that was nowe in the Co?issioners hand?: Yet in the meane time hauinge by so many and vndoubted wayes vnderstood the same confirmed he said he thought it fitt to impart it to the Court that wth him they might all praise God. Hee further acquainted the Court that since monday last himselfe and diuers members of the Companie had bin serued wth processe out of the Kings Bench by vertue of a Quo warranto prosecuted by mr Atturney against the Companie, the Tenor of wch Quo warranto was to knowe by what authority they claime to be a Companie and to haue and vse those liberties and priuiledges as are related in the said Quo waranto, and most of them taken for those wch are contayned in his Maties Letters Patents vnto the Companie: Of wch Quo warranto he presented two Copies in Court the one in latin and the other in Eng- lish;1 1 A copy of the English version of the Quo Warranto is among the Ferrar Papers, Magdalene Col- lege, Cambridge. The writ, together with the pleadings and the judgment, is recorded in the Coram Rege Roll of the Kings Bench, James I, 21st yr. Michaelmas Term, Roll, No. 1528, Membranes 39–63. See List of Records, No. 585, Vol. I, page 184, ante. wherevpon the Companie desired that in English might be read wch being Donne the Companie conceauinge and acknowledginge this legall manner of proceedinge to be faire and with much fauor from his Matie desired the Defendants to take espeaciall care of the buissines as beinge the Companies cause although prosecuted by perticuler names, their Patent beinge called in question wch they conceaue was therefore to be pleaded. And further as touchinge the charge of this suite (wch was conceaued would be verie great) it was generally thought fitt it should be borne by the Companies generall Stocke, and therevpon vnanimously agreed and ordered by a generall erec?on of hand? (not one dissentinge) that what Disbursements should be made by the Defendants and others in this suite (prouided it were for the Companies cause and Defence and not for matters that vpon the issue shall fall vpon perticuler ?sons and their Ac?ons) should be ?duely? repaid vnto them by the Companie. And it was likewise ordered that the entertayninge of Counsell Atturneyes Cr in this buissines should be left to the choise and care of the Defendant?. Sr Iohn Dãuers and mr Tomlins were entreated by the Court to speake with Sr Henry Martin Iudge of the Admiralty to desire that fauor of him as to respite his ?the? further proceeding in the cause between Wye and the Companie (nowe Dependinge before him) vntill the said Wye returne into England from beyond the Seas. Mr Deputie informed the Court that his Maties Co?issioners intendinge to meete on ffriday next to consider of such References as came from the Lord? vnto them; Amongst wch the case of the Polander and that of the Widdowe Smalley were nowe come to their hand? to be exam- ined: Had therefore warned him and such others as the Companie should thinke fitt to attend them that day (they havinge nowe the Companies book? returned vnto them from the Lord?:) The Court herevpon praid mr Deputie to attend them accordingly as being best acquainted wth the passages of their Court? concerninge them. [345] Mr Hackett desired in the behalfe of mr Morgan that whereas there was a Debt longe due vnto him from the Companie since there was no ready money to discharge it, he might haue the Companies Seale for security. Mr Deputie likewise moued in the behalfe of his Brother and himselfe that havinge engaged themselues diuers wayes for the Companie and laide out much money since the last Accompt it would please the Court to thinke of some course for their discharges as soone as might be and that in the meane space they might haue the Companies Seale §to§ secure them for such moneys as they had disbursed since the last Audite and likewise to saue them harmeles from all engagemt wher- into they had ruñ for the Companies cause onely and by their order as namely for the ffrenchmen Cr. The Officers likewise to whome there are much wages due desired the like considera?on and care as namely the Secretary, Husband, Bookeeper, and Beadle: And mr Deputie acquainted them with a peti?on of ffrancis Carter in this kinde who claimeth 60li, but it beinge late the Court would not heare it read but it was conceaued most fitt and requisite to giue the seuerall ?ties satisfac?on in this kinde till the Companie could make them payment: And therevpon it was by a generall erec?on of hands ordered that vpon due examina?on and proofe of the ?ticulers alledged the Seales should be giuen the next Quarter Court and in the meane space the Auditors were entreated to meete concerning these matters and to sett them straite and ?to?Drawe vp such Draught? for the seuerall securities as were fitt to be passed in the Quarter Court. Mr Iohn ffarrar moued that whereas the Companie had out of their loue &amp; approba?on of his seruice bestowed vpon him 20 shares great shares It would nowe please the Court to confirme them vnto him in the next Quarter Court vnder their Seale. And that whereas likewise there was due vnto him 1 1 A blank space in the manuscript. shares of land for about 40: ?sons sent, those ?sonall shares might be reduced vnto great shares vizt euery two ?sons to make one great share of old Aduenture: The Court condiscended to both these mo?ons and the Auditors were intreated to consider of fitt Drafts thereof against the next Quarter Court and such as might serue for others in the like cases. A ?re from an vnknowne ?son beinge presented to the Court and read wherein was enclosed two peeces of gold of 40s for a Sermon to be preached this yeare (as was the last) before the Companie: It beinge taken into considera?on it was thought fitt (and so agreed) the Sermon should be respited for a time in reguard of the present troubles of the Companie. Mr Caswell prayinge allowance for the money he disbursed ouer aboue that he receaued of the Companie for their last Sermon feast at Mar- chantaylors Hall beinge then their Steward was referred to the Auditors to be farther considered of.</field>

The Cort held on Wedensday the 12th of Nouember was read and by a generall erec?on of hands approued to be rightly sett downe. Mr Deputie acquainted the Court if it pleased the Commissioners on ffriday last to ?mitt the readinge ouer of the generall Letter to the Companie from the Gouernor and Counsell of Virginia wch did beare Date the 5° of Iune last wch havinge diligently obserued and since also hauinge conferred wth some others then ?sent he said he would the deliuer the contents thereof vnto them The ?re was from Sr ffrancis Wyatt Rogr Smith Geo: Yeardley Io: Pountys Io: Pott Raph Hamer Geo: Sandys Christo: Dauison And directed to t[he] [346] Ea of Southampton and the rest of the Lord? of the Counsell for Virginia: And began thus That by a succesfull Stratagem they had not only regained their people but cutt of diuers of the Indian Kinges and great Comaunders: Amongst whome they are confident that Opachankano was one it beinge impossible for him to escape, beinge the designe was chiefely on his person and that exposed to the prin- cipall danger: That hauinge held them in a longe hope of Peace they had gained the knowledge of their places of residence and that their Corne was nowe so forward as it was to late for them vpon this fresh occasion to remoue so that they doubted not to giue them shortley a blowe that shall neare or altogether ruinate them: That the ffort goeth on cheerefully (consideringe the number of their people and the many imploymts they haue besid?:) And two thousand acres of land ?of inheritance? should be sett out for such as shalbe willinge to plant about it there beinge land enough: And the like respects for all part? where Citties and fortified Townes are to be built: They wish also that Martins Hundred might be taken into reguard because it greatly importeth the security and plentie of the Planta?on and wthall the distruc?on of the Sauadges in that they shall haue thereby a neare passage to their principall Seates and the better co?and both of that and the other Riuer wch they wish might be supplied and that speedily with great numbers to make good their nowe inhabited Seate and that also §of§ Chescack, And that if a Pale were sett to ruñ between, it would gaine the whole fforest and make it inaccessable to the Sau- adges, And they aduise that the Comanders be agreed with, for a yearely rent by the Pole: They desire likewise to knowe the Com- panies pleasure (because it is not mentioned in their Instruc?ons) whither they may make prise of such Dutch and ffrench as they shall finde to trade with the Sauadges within our Limitts. Lastly they certifie that the whole Collony God be thanked haue recouered health and that nothinge wants more then sodaine and great Supplies of People well furnished to giue perfec?on to this noble Ac?on And so ended their letter, whereat the Companie did much reioyce praisinge God for soe good newes. And one mr Raymond likewise beinge nowe present in Court acquainted the Companie that he was in Virginia in May last when I?otan the great Kinge sent to Sr ffrauncis Wyatt word that if he would send vp some ten or twelue Englishmen vnto him he would deliuer all the rest of the Captiue English he had and would also deliuer his Brother Opachankano who was the Author of the Massacre into the hands of the English either aliue or dead: And some fower dayes before that, he the said Raymond came from Virginia, Captaine Tucker with some Twelue more was gonne to do this exploite wch nowe it seemed by the Report of this Letter was performed. The Companie beinge informed that the foresaid generall letter was still in the Co?issioners hands desired mr Tomlins and mr Copland to repaire vnto them sometime to morrowe and to entreat them that the Companie may haue the originall or at least a Coppie thereof to be read at their Quarter Court for the generall satisfac?on of all men. Whereas the Companie heretofore in a thankfull acknowledgemt of the great &amp; extraordinary care and paines that the Right Honoble the Ea: of Southampton and Sr Edwin Sandys haue taken for the good of the Companie and aduancement of the Planta?on did giue vnto each of them 20 shares of land of old Aduenture: It was nowe moued that the said shares might be confirmed vnto them vnder the Compa Seale wch mo?on the Court generally condiscended vnto and therevpon desired mr Tomlins mr Bromfeild mr Copland mr ffelgate mr Seaward or any two of them to meete at mr Deputies to [347] morrowe about 10 of the Clocke to ioyne wth the Auditors and Co?ittees about ye preparing of some fitt Draft? against the Quarter Court for that purpose as also for drawinge vpp of those seu9all Securities that were appointed to be donne at the last Court wch seuerall thing? were ordered to be passed at the Quarter Court. And whereas it was also moued by some of the Aduenturers of the Blomery worke that they might haue a Patent wth a full propor?on of land due for their Aduenture and for the number of persons that they haue already or shall hereafter transport for aduancement of that worke: The Court generally agreed therevnto recomending it to the care of the former Co?ittee to conceaue the forme of a Patent and to make it ready against the Quarter Court: And also to thinke what further benifitt or priuiledge the Companie might graunt vnto them wch they were willinge to doe, so much they prized and esteemed this Supplie. Mr Berkley presented his peti?on to the Court wch beinge read the Court thought fitt to referre it to the considera?on of the former Co?ittee who are to certifie their opinions what they shall thinke fitt to be donne therein. The Court havinge considered also of ffrauncis Carters peti?on are pleased this offer be made vnto him. vizt that for the 60li remayninge due for his wages he shall haue fiue shares of 12li 10g ? share and shall likewise haue giuen him eight shares more in reward of his good seruice wherewith the Co?ittee are to make him acquainted and if he shalbe contented therewth the Com? doth promise they shalbe con- firmed vnto him at their next Quarter Court.</field>

Right Honoble Cr. Wee haue by a succesfull stratagem not onely regayned our people but cutt off some kings and divers of the greatest Comaunders of the Enemie, amonge whome wee are assured Opachankano is one, itt beinge impossible for him to escape the designe beinge cheifly vppon his ?son and yt happilie exposed to the greatest daunger. By holdinge them in a long hope of peace, wee haue come to knowledge of their places of residence and their Corne is now soe for- ward that itt is to late for them vppon this fresh occasion to remoue soe that wee doubt not to giue them shortlie a blowe, that shall neer or altogether ruinate them. The fforte goeth cheerfully on for the nomber of our people and ye many serv- ices they are to be imployed in, and wee conceave itt would be of speciall Consequence if you would be pleased to graunt a Commission for 2000 Acres of land of inheritance to such as shalbe willinge to plant about itt, wch the Societie may well spare, there beinge Land enough besides, and better then that for Ten Thousand Planters. Wee desire you wee may haue yor Peremptory answere to this poynte for the faylinge of the like to divers of our letters, hath been a great hinderance to our ?ceeding?. The like respect must be had to all ?ts wher Citties &amp; ffortified Townes are to be built, there beinge many fitt places for yt purpose in this River, and many forward Planters already want roome to seate on. Martins Hundred also would be taken into yor regard wch greatly importeth the secur- itie and plenty of this Planta?on and wth all the Destruc?on of ye Sauages in yt wee shall haue herby a swifte passage to their principall Seates &amp; the better comaund both of this and the other River; Wch must be supplyed, and yt speedilie, wth greater nombers yt may make good this their now inhabited seate &amp; yt of Chescack a pale beinge runn between, wins the wholl fforrest and makes itt inaccessable to the Salvages. An excellent place and not fitt to be lefte vnpeopled any longer. And to thend their badd returnes may no longer dis- courage them wee thinke itt the best course, both for themselvs their Officers, and servants, that ye Comaunders be agreed wth for a certaine rent yearly, for everie on by the Poll, yt shall live vndertakinge allso for all publi? charges and advancemt of Staple Comodities.

Wch beinge read the Court approved and by a generall erection of hands (one onely dissentinge) ordered itt to be sealed. Mr Casewell likewise acquainted the Court, that wheras hee wth on other were appoynted Stewards for ?vidinge the Sup? kept att Marchant Taylors Hall the last yeare for the Company, and for defray- inge the charge of the said Sup? haveinge Disbursed all the monneys hee receaved from the Adventurers (as appeared by a ?ticuler Accompt therof long agoe ?sented) hee had been lately arrested by a Poulterrer for certaine monney due to him vppon that Acc° and therby forced to pay to him and others to the Su?e of 14li: 17s. 00 more then hee receaved, for repayment wherof for soe much as the former Court had Audited ordered hee should haue securitie vnder the Companies Seale, hee prayd itt might be expedited and passed accordinglie by Order of this Court Wch request the Court takinge into Considera?on and thinkinge itt a most vniust and vnworthie thinge that hee beinge specially requested to vndergoe that troublesome Office, and haueinge ?formed itt soe well to their good Content should be soe much Dampni- fied, did therevppon Order and agree by a generall erection of hands (except three that dissented) that his securitie should be forthwth Drawne vpp and passed vnder the Companies Seale for repayment of the said su?e of 14li: 17s 00d out of such monneys as should com into the generall bodie of ye Company. And further that the Companies good acceptance of his care and paines in that service was such as deserved a ?ticuler acknowledgment of thank? from them. The next thinge taken into Considera?on was that waightie Proposi- ?on lately made by the Lords of the Councell vnto the Company touchinge the surrendringe vpp of their Charters: [354] Concern- inge wch and that itt might be the better vnderstood what had former- lie passed these severall Court? of the 15th, 20th and 22th of October were read as allso that of the 12th of this ?sent moneth Wherby itt appeared that although the Company in their answere would haue referred their resolu?on touchinge the said Proposi?on till the Deter- mina?on of this Quarter Court yett their said Answere was not accepted by their LLps: and since that time another course was now taken to bringe that buisines to a Legall tryall as appeared by the Quo warranto prosecuted by mr Atturney against the Company. Soe that itt was conceaved that itt was too late and out of season to take that Propsi?on againe into a fresh Dispute as was desyred by some; butt rather to consider whither this Court would confirme the pro- ceedings of the former Courts touchinge the aforesaid Proposi?on, and soe holde to the Plea of their Charters wch were now questioned. Whervppon after mature Delibera?on mr Deputie att the desire of the Court putt itt to the question, and by a generall erection of hands (seaven onely dissentinge) the Court vnanimously agreed and ordered that the ?ceedings of the aforesaid Courts touchinge the not sur- rendringe vp of their Charters should hereby be ratified and con- firmed. Itt was allsoe propounded, that for the better prosecution of soe waightie a buisines (wch would require often and serious Consulta?on,) that a large Committee might be appoynted to Consult and giue Direc- ?on as often as Occasion should be offered. Wch Proposi?on the Court conceavinge to be verie important and of great necessitie did ther- vppon agree and order by a generall erec?on of hands (five onely dis- sentinge) that the Grand Co?ittee formerly appoynted should take care to dyrect all matters requisite &amp; ap?teyninge to that buisines. And that thervppon the Deputie should haue authoritie to su?on them att all times or such parte of them as hee should thinke meete. A mo?on was likewise made yt the Lords of the Counsell might be humbly peti?oned by the Company for restoringe their Books and writings wherby they might be the better enhabled to prepare their proofs and make their Defence in that waightie cause now in hand, wch Mo?on the Court well approved of, and thervppon ordered by a generall erec?on of hands a Peti?on to be drawne vpp accordinglie. Mr Binge hearinge this mo?on of Peti?oninge the Lords for ye Com- panies Books, said (as hee was goinge out of the Court) that lett them make as many Peti?ons as they will, they shall [355] assoone haue a Haulter as haue them: Wherof present Complainte beinge made, and the words iustified by three that over heard him namely by mr Gilbert Morewood, mr Wiseman, and mr Spruson, the Court were much troubled therat, and held itt fitt to be complayned of to the Lords of the Counsell. The Quarter Courte of the 15th of Ivne last was read: Wherin for so- much as itt appeared, that the Company did then in obedyence to his Maties Letter forbeare the Election of their Officers, and continue their old till this present Quarter Coort. Mr Deputy moved the Coort would now ?ceed to a new Choyce: wch buisines beinge taken into considera?on, Itt was att length for many important reasons thought fitt and ordered by a generall erec?on of hands (two onely dissentinge) that all the present Officers of the Company should be continued in their places vntill a new Elec?on in a Quarter Court. Mr Deputie made knowne to the Court that since May last there haue gone to Virginia ffourteen Saile of Shipps most of them laden wth Provisions wherin there haue been transported about the number of 340 ?sonns, as more ?ticularlie appeares by the note hee then pre- sented and read wch is here inserted.

The Court beinge made acquainted by mr Deputie that for sattisfiinge the monney issued out of the Stocke given for buildinge of the East India Schoole intended in Virginia and employed vppõ the publique buisines of the Company, the Co?ittee vppõ a Treaty wth mr Copeland thought fitt an allowance be made either in Cattle or by turninge ouer some of the Companies Tenants for the vse [356] of the saide Schoole; Did thervppon agree that accordinglie sattisfac?on should be made by the Company to the full for the monney soe borrowed and employed. Itt was allsoe agreed accordinge to a Treatie had wth mr Maurice Berkley by the said Co?ittee that hee should haue his Three requests wch hee made in his Peti?on to the former Court: (vizt) that hee should be released and sett free from the Companies service. Sec- ondlie that for makinge of Salt hee should haue the vse of the Com- panies Panns in Virginia. Thirdly that hee shall haue the propor?on of Land sett out and assured to him and his heirs forever wch was formerlie ?mised to him and his ffather Cr. Mr Tomlyns passed one Share of Land to mr Edward Olliuer, wch beinge propounded in the Preparatiue Coorte and now againe and noe excep?on taken theratt, was confirmed vnto the said Edward Olliver and hee thervppon admitted. Vppon mo?on order was given for a Comission to be drawne vpp and sealed for William Peirce mr: of the good Shipp called the Returne of 100 Tunns bound for transporta?on of Passengers to Virginia.</field>

Mr Wrote likewise signified of Three things o?itted in ye aforesaid Quarter Court wch hee then offered to the Considera?on of ye Com- pany when they came to the Proposi?on touchinge the surrendringe vpp of the Patent Companies Charters.

And lastlie whither if they should stand out in Sute wth the Kinge they were able wthout his gracious fauour and assistance to subsist and make good that great Action of vpholdinge and advance- inge the Plantation, wch things were acknowledged to be spoken by mr Wrote as likewise the answere to them (vizt) That the Company did not Doubt butt on a full and right informa?on of their ?ceeding? his Matie: would be pleased to lett them haue his gracious fauour in more ample manner then ever. [358] Butt the omittinge of these things was by the Court adiudged to be no defect in entringe of the former Court beinge not arguments of that nature as those yt did conduce to the Conclusion: Yett vppõ mr Wrotes Desire itt was ordered they should be now in this Court inserted.

Wherein they nothinge Doubt of theire redy willingnes as the importance of this buisiness (equally concerninge the good of both Planta?ons) doth necessarilie require. Edw: Waterhouse Secre?. Vppon the readinge wherof mr Withers tooke excep?ons att the pa? beinge intituled as an Act of the So?er Ilands Company, wch hee conceived had not mett since their last beinge att ffounders Hall As for the Assemblies att Sr Thomas Smithes hee did doubt for his ?t whither they were Vsurpations vppon the Gouermt rather then the Lawfull Courts of the Company; In wch Proposicon itt seemed hee was by divers others seconded, and on the Contrarie some alleadged that Sr Thomas Smith was Confirmed Gouernor by the Kings letter: Wch mr Withers answered hee was ignorant of. Butt the Virginia Company desyred this question might be silenced now in their Court and lefte to the tryall of themselvs att the next So?er Ilands Quarter Courte. Butt for the matter in hand the Court desyred that the Proposi?ons of the So?er Ilands Adventurers might be ?duced, wch mr Edwards acknowledged to haue in writinge Butt desyred that the Company would first appoynte a Co?ittee before they heard the Proposi?on: Wch kinde of course seemed verie strange to the Court and contrarie to all former presidents, that they should appoynt a Co?ittee wthout some light of ye ?ticularities and therevppon much Dispute arysinge on each partie, itt was by divers held vnfitt to meddle wth any new Proposi?on, butt to reserve all to the Parliament now att hand; who haueinge att their last sittinge out of their love to Virginia butt much more out of their care of the wellfaire of this kingdome, sett a verie good course concerninge the Tobaccoes of the Planta?ons, itt was to be hoped vppon the same ground itt might be now fully effected wch was then lefte vn?fect; besides consyderinge the vncer- taine State the Company stood in, itt Did not seeme either saffe or reasonable to begin a new treatie. [360] Yett never the lesse that there might be noe shaddowe of Scandall vppon the Company as if out of willfullnes they would neglect any thinge that might tend to the good of the Planta?ons although the strangness of mr Edward? Demaunds wch hee and some others reso- lutely made to haue a Co?ittee named before hee produced his Propo- si?ons, was the more increased by the speeches of mr Edward? and mr Wrote, who affirmed that the So?er Ilands Companies Proposi?ons were soe vncertaine &amp; onely in Imagina?on as theris as much expecta- ?on to haue some Proposi?on from ye Virginia Co?ittee as from themselvs: and mr Edward? affirmed that the Co?ittee should vnder- stand that pryvately wch is not fitt to be publiquely made knowne: Yett nevertheless to gayne knowledge of their Proposicons, the Court did by erec?on of hands order that without Preiudiceinge the Question whether they from whome these Proposi?ons came were the lawfull Company of ye Su?er Ilands, there should be a Co?ittee appoynted by this Court to giue them a meetinge, and if they thinke fitt to debate the matters propounded: butt not to conclude any thinge, butt to reserve all entire to the Preparatiue Courte: Whervppon mr Edward? produced a pa? beinge as followeth. At a Su?er Iland? Coort ye 13: Ianuarij 1623. The grounds or reasons wch induce ye So?er Iland? Company to desire a meetinge wth ye Virginia Company They Conceive and vppon full Debate haue by erec?on of hands resolved. ffirst That the Planta?on cannott subsist butt by a better vent of their Tobacco then formerlie they haue had. Secondly. That noe ease of Custome or any other course that wee can devise will serve to vent the saide Tobacco as aforesaide, butt onely by prohibit- inge all fforraigne Tobacco and forbiddinge ye planting of itt at home, Soe as there may no other Tobacco he vented in England butt such as shalbe of the groweth of Virginia and the Su?er Islands— Edw: Waterhouse Secr?: Wch beinge read there was some exception taken att the first that itt was too absolutely sett downe: for they did not doubt [361] butt Vir- ginia would shortlie subsiste vppon farr better Co?odities then Tobacco: And for the Second they were of opinion that wthoutt exclu- sion of fforraigne that of the Planta?ons could never be well vented: And the Court nõiated for their Comittee, Sr Iohn Dauers, mr Deputie, mr Wither, mr White or mr Iohn Smith, and mr Casewell who were desyred to giue the So?er Ilands Aduenturers a meetinge att Grocers Hall att such time as Sr Thomas Smith should appoynte vppõ a dayes warninge before to the intent formerlie expressed.

There was this Daie read att the Board a Peti?on in the name of sundry Adventurers &amp; Planters of ye Virginia Plantations Complayninge that wheras sundry of them are willinge to surrender vpp their Patent for poynt of Gouerment, his Matie takinge care to preserve everie mans ?ticular Interest as hath been requyred by his Matie: and that divers others of the said Company refusinge to conforme themselvs to his Maties pleasure are ?ceeded against by mr Atturney Generall by a writt of Quo war- ranto that they yett haue made an Order in Court that the charge of their Defence shalbe borne by the publi? Stocke to the preiudice as is conceived of those others who are willinge to surrender ?vp? the Patent: Itt was this day Ordered that all they who are questioned in ye said Quo warranto shall make their Defence att their owne ?ticuler charge wthout any help or dispendinge any ?t of the publi? Stock in that case; And that such as are willinge to surrender shalbe discharged from all contribu?on towards the expence of the saide sute both in their ?sons and their goods. Ext Williã Beecher [362] Weh beinge Read mr Deputie signified that this Order as appears was grounded vppon a Peti?on presented to the ?s of the Counsell by Alderman Iohnson and others, att the same time himselfe and §some§ others of the Company were Comaunded to attend their ?ps att Whitehall and were present: of Wch Peti?on haueinge obteyned a Coppie hee prayed might be read, the Coppie wherof doth here ensue.

Stocke of the Company. Against whose contempt mr Atturney Generall doth now ?ceed by writt of Quo warranto, in his Maties: Court of the Kings Bench. They humbly pray that itt may be ordered by yor ?ps that all the charge &amp; expence occasioned by these sutes may be borne and expended by themselvs that are defendts and opposites in the cause, and no ?t therof by the Companies publique Stocke nor by the goods of any the Adven- turers and Planters yt shew themselvs conformable.

And they shall ever pray for yor ?ps Cr. Wch beinge read mr Deputie signified further that although ye Peti- ?oners did earnestly labour and presse that all the Companies goods that should com from Virginia might be sequestred and deposited in his Maties: Custome house, yett their Lps noble favour &amp; Iustice was such as not to thinke itt equall or reasonable soe to doe. Whervppon itt pleased their Lops to order no otherwise vppõ their Peti?on then as they had heard by the Order now presented &amp; read and to leaue the goods of the generall Company free wch the [363] Peticoners Desyred to haue sequestered (as hee conceaved) purposelie to deprive himselfe and his Brother and those other to whome ye Company had made over such goods for securitie of ye great Su?s due vnto them. A mo?on was made and generally thought fitt to be referred to the Considera?on of the Grand Co?ittee to thinke on some course for movinge his Maties: Co?issioners that they would please to certifie and make some reporte to ye ?s: of the Counsell what they haue done in the severall buisinesses brought before them by the Company of Virginia and their Opposers that itt may appear to what heads and issue they haue brought the same, assuringe themselvs that therby the Iustnes &amp; fayrnes of the Companies ?ceedings would be manyfest to all the world.

Dyott the sonne of mr Anthony Dyott desired to be admitted into the Company as his ffathers heire of Two shares wch hee had paid for long agoe. Mr Deputie acquainted them that the Auditors haueinge ?vsed the Accompts found the said mr Anthony Dyott indebted vppõ subscrip- ?on 12li: 10s: wch the Court adiudged to be a barr that his heir could not alienate the Land to a stranger butt not to hinder his admittance into the Company in that right: Wherfore the Court were willinge hee should be admitted the next Court in regard they vnderstood him to be a gentleman of good worth and learned in the Lawe.

And was further Desyrous to haue some more of them. Whervppõ the Court beinge willinge to pleasure Capt Martin in any thing they could wth convenyencie did generally agree [367] to giue him the said 12 Peeces and head Peeces as allso 8 more Peeces to make them vpp Twentie. Butt wheras hee further Peti?oned yt the Company would be pleased in his behalfe to giue their securitie vnto ?one? mr Tatem for Certaine Notts hee should take vpp of him att a years day of payment: The Company findinge themselvs divers wayes allready much engaged and doubtinge besides wither their Securitie wilbe accepted as nowe things stand did not thinke fitt to make any such offer. Molasco the Polander Peti?oninge for such monney hee said his Maties: Co?issioners found due vnto him from the Company, was answered yt the Company had made itt appeare by their answere to ye said Com- issioners that hee was not to be sattisfied from them butt from such as haue receaved great allowances from the Company for sattisfac?on of him and the rest of the Polanders as appeared vppõ the Companies Accompts, And namely from mr Woodall whom the Comissioners ?mised to examyne vppõ Oath touching the said monneys, vnto whome the Peti?oer was to repayre to know what they had done therin.

Whervppõ ye generall letter from the Gouernor and Counsell of Virginia vnto the Company here was read: bearinge date at Iames Citty the 29: of Ianuary—1623.1 1 This letter is cited in List of Records, No. 620, Vol. I, page 188, ante. This series of letters may be in No. 627, on the same page.

Middlesex. Rich: Weston. Mr Deputie acquainted the Court that vppon the first Deliverie of this Peti?on to him on ffryday sennight by some of the Planters, hee desyred them that they would sett downe in writinge those greivances and oppressions wch they men?oned in generall that soe they might haue a ready and full answere Whervppon they ?mised to doe itt, butt the next morninge they came to him and tolde him they had thought vppon the matter and would not deliver the ?ticulars of their greivances and oppressions butt before the Lo: Treasuror to wch mr Deputy made answere that hee would acquainte my Lord and the Counsell therwith, and if itt caused any delay in their buisiness it was their owne fault, yett afterwards they brought him a certaine writinge (Article wise) conteyninge divers matters butt without any hand vnto itt although in the end they say wee who haue vnderwritt itt will maynteyne itt on our oaths, whervppon hee desyred them to sett their hands to the said writinge that itt was their Complainte: wch they promised to doe butt afterwards they sent him word, they would not sett their hands to itt: Whervppon the Company not conceivinge itt fitt that a writinge of such a nature should be openly read without a certaine Author to avowe itt, desyred mr Deputy and some other of the Counsell to ?vse itt, and deliver their opynions whether itt were fitt to be read: wch beinge done ye Counsells opynion was that itt ought not to be read for that itt conteyned Cryminall charges of a verie high Nature and some of them Capitall against the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia; Soe as some very worthy Lawyers affirmed that the ?sons that had presented itt except they would maynteyne it had incurred the penalty of Lybellers. The Counsell further delivered that of all the Articles (beinge Nyne) there was onely one that gaue any charge to ye Company [375] here at home all the rest being dyrected solely against the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia wheras their peti?on to his Matie: was penned against the Companies greivous oppressions, wherof beinge desyred to deliver the ?ticulers they had onelie instanced one: By wch manner of proceedinge the Court con- ceived this to be a malicious practize of some of their enemies to Defame and disgrace them with his Royall Maty: and although some would haue gone about to excuse itt through simplycetie of the Planters that did not soe exactly distinguish ye Gou9ment here and there, butt ?haps thought that because the Company hath the Com- maund and authoritie of the Gouernor there, that therefore the default by them in Virginia might be imputed to the Company here: This excuse gaue noe manner of sattisfac?on att all; for itt was answered that the Company here was not any way guilty of their misgover- ment, except vppon knowledge therof they had neglected or denyed to reforme itt, butt these things were never complayned of. Butt because itt was reported that there was one of these Articles that touched the Company the Court desyred itt might be read being ye 8 in number as followeth. 8: Eightly Wheras vppon Complainte made to his Matie: of the miserable estate and Condi?on of the Planters in Virginia for want of Corne the last year: It then pleased his Maty: in Comiseration of their distressed estate to cause the Company of Virginia to send ouer prouision of Meale for their releife, the saide Company to receaue of them in Virginia for the saide Meale the monny they laide out for the same togeather with the charge of transpor- ta?on wth out any further gaine. Notwithstandinge the saide Order, when the said Prouision came into Virginia in a Ship called the Hopewell the Cape Marchant mr Harte appoynted thervnto by the saide Company sould the said Meale Vnto ye saide ffreemen in Virginia at excessive and vnreasonable rates as Seauenty, or eighty Pounds waight of Tobacco a Hogsheade. Mr Casewell herevppon (beinge appoynted heretofore by the Aduen- turers to buy the Meale) declared that at the time the said Meale was bought it cost 9s ? bushell, wch with Custome petty charges, and freight made itt i3s ? bushell Soe that a Hogshead Conteyninge 9 bushells came to 5: 17: 00 wch beinge sould for 80 weight of Tobacco valued now here in London by the Customers themselvs att 18d ? pound one with another as by the Customers Certificate vnto the Lord Treasuror appears: after the Deduction of the Charge of Custome Impost and freight with allowance of shrinkadge there will scarce remayne vjd cleare vppon each pound to the owner: But though itt should be solde to cleer js wch was more then any man could hope the 80 pound waight would com to butt 4li: wheras itt cost 5li: 17s.00d Soe that a Third of the principall would be lost besides the time and Adventure. Butt mr Casewell himselfe and divers other principall Adventurers in yt Magazine did openly make offer to sell their whole Adventures for halfe ye principall if any man would buy it. The vniustnes and absurditie of this Complainte of ye Planters did much greive the Company, that where they deserved thank? for their Charitie they should be Complayned of for Oppressors, and the falsi- tie of itt did make them suspect that those against the Gouernor and Counsell in Virginia were of noe greater trueth for what would they feare to say of them beinge absent and not able to answere for them- selvs, when they durst complaine of the Company to the Lo: Treas- uror of a thinge soe evydently false: Besides those planters present in Court togeather with all others giveinge ample testimoney of ye worthie proceedings of Sr ffraunces Wyat whome in their Consciencies they ?fessed to esteeme a most iust and sincere gentleman, and free from all manner [376] of Corruption or pryvate ends: itt was dyrectly Contradictory that hee should be guilty of such oppressions or misdemeanors. Whervppon the Court demaundinge againe of some of the Planters who had brought these greivances beinge then in Court, whether they would avowe and maynteyne them, and itt beinge denyed by them and namely by one Perie who likewise further confessed that although the last clause was in these words. Lastly the greiuances aboue mentioned, and other abuses offered to particular Planters by the Gouernors &amp; Counsell in Virginia, hath caused the Parties whose names are subscribed to these greiuances (and an infinite number of others soe resolued) to quit Virginia and betake themselues to a more pryuate life, wch wilbe a means to ouerthrowe the Planta?on there, &amp; abate the bene- fitt of his Mats: Customs here: All wch greiuances wee or some of Vs can iustifie vppon oath, and haue likewise been desired by our frends in Virginia to prefeer these greiuances to his Roya?. Matie. Yett they had noe Comission noe authoritie from the Planters in Vir- ginia to Complaine, butt the Peti?on and greiuances were framed here at home In these regaurds the Company thought to pass itt ouer in favour of the Planters who they ?ceived had been abused and drawne to this Course by some others. Butt for the Peti?on ittselfe to his Maty: the Court thought fitt that sume Answere should §be§ returned to the Lo: Treasuror and mr Chauncellor: Whervppõ entringe into an examina?on of the parts therof: They enquyred of the said Perry and others, what Imposi?ons they had ever paid to the supporte of the Company, wherof they were not able to alleadge one. Next the said Perry and others beinge Demaunded touchinge the Clause of their Peti?on in these words: Haue perticularly been more neerly pressed then euer, not onely with the now vrginge, and Continuall assault? and surprises of the incensed enimie, whereby they are inforced by one halfe of their men, to secure and guard the Labours of the other, butt allsoe by the many Imposi?ons and Leuies laid ?and made? vppon them towards the support of the Company from whence heretofore they were wont to receive releife. Mr Iohn fferrar informed the Court that Richard Brewster one of the Peti?oners had told him that this last yeare, wth noe more then three men and himselfe hee had made 2800 waight of Tobacco §besides§ :100: bushells of Corne. Butt mr William Capps openly delivered on the fayth of an honest man that with Three boyes onely, wch hee said were not a man and a halfe hee had made Three Thousand weight of Tobacco and had sould 50 barrells of Corne heaped measure to Capt: Whittakers and kept besides that 60: barrells for his owne store, and all this hee had ?formed by the labour of those three boyes onely him- selfe haveing never done (as hee termed itt) one stroake of worke: Vppõ wch Reports and divers other the like, the Company conceived that insinua?on of soe much daunger and disquyett from ye Salvadges was extended farr beyound trueth. Next they tooke into their Considera?on an other clause in the said Peticon in these words. But now for it is that as well the generall state of the Planta?on as the per- ticular of euery Planter beinge fallen into a farr worse and poorer estate than they were in former times, when yor Matie spared to demaund those duties: [377] Wch the Courte Conceived to be one of the most vntrue and iniurious suggestions in all poynt? that could be devysed, the Collony notwith- standinge all these Calamities of late in number of people multitude of houses and Plantations aboundance of Cattle and provisions, tenn times exceedinge the generall estate of those former times wch they spake of, and aboue five times better, then itt was lefte by Sr Thomas Smith, and Sr Samuell Argall, and for the estate of ?ticuler Planters itt was by many ?ticulars instanced, that divers pryvate Planters had this yeare for themselvs brought home more goods and to a greater value then the wholl Collony and Planta?on did then returne. Mr Deputy moved yt for as much as Sr ffrauncis Wyat? Comission of beinge Gouernor of Virginia would shortly expire, and that hee was willinge as appeared by his owne letter to resigne that place to some more able man. The Company would therfore please to bethinke themselvs against the next Quarter Court, either of Contynuinge the present Gouernor, or of choosinge a new to succeed in his place. Touchinge wch the Court conceived they had time ennough to resolve between this and the Quarter Court. This present Court by a generall erec?on of hands is ordered to con- tinue after 6: of the Clocke duringe pleasure. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that the Counsell of Virginia vppon ye Companies earnest and importunate sollycita?ons had drawne vpp a Peti?on to be presented to the Parlyament, wch beinge read was as followeth. To the Honoble house of Co?ons assembled in Parlyament The humble Peti?on of the Treasuror, Counsell &amp; Company of Virginia. Shewinge: That after divers Discoveries had confirmed an opyneon, that ye Country (now Virginia) was scituate in a temperate wholsome Clymate, and that the Soyle was exceedinge fertell, the Parts watred with fruitfull, and Nauigable Riuers, wherby our men and Shippinge through a fair Sea might haue a Comfortable fallinge on a saffe Choast; It pleased God to affect the myndes of many worthily disposed Noblemen and Gentlemen and others to vnderstand itt a matter of great Religion and honour to endeavour the propa- gatinge of Christianytie amongst those Barbarous People and gaine such a hopefull addi?on of Dominion to his Matie: most deservinge the highest honour of such an Enterprize: who beinge informed therof and apprehendinge the great honour and Comoditie might arrise to this State, by ?fectinge a Christian Planta?on in those partes. Itt pleased his Matie: by his most gracious Letters Patents of Incorporation (from tyme to time renued &amp; enlarged) to conferr as ample pryviledges and immunities both for their Assistance, who should becom Directors, or Gouernors in the buissines, and for their comforte, who should be willinge to settle and inhabite in Virginia as could then be foreseen or desyred: wch gaue so generall an encourragement, that Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen Cittizens and others in great numbers, originally named in the seuerall Letters Patents became Aduenturors, who besides their monneys gaue many folde helpes with Industry to advance the ?fec?on of this glorious worke. And notwthstandinge a multitude of Accident? and disasters incydent to a new Planta?on in a remote and Sauadge Country: It pleased God to refresh their hopes by such an vndoubted probabillitie of attayninge (at least for the pub- lique of their Country and Posteritie) a most beneficall Retribu?on for all their expence and paynes, as in the end might Crowne their endeavors with as much Glorie, Honour, &amp; Proffitt to this Kingdome as could be wished or expected haueinge in their Contempla?on the ground? followinge. [378] 1The Conversion of Saluages to Christianytie and establishinge the first Planta?on of the reformed Religion. 2The removeinge of the Surcharge of necessitous people, the matter or fewell of daungerous insurrections, and therby leavinge the greater plentie to susteyne those remayninge within this Land. 3The lardgnes of Territory knowne greate, may prove much greater, the fertilitie of the Soyle and temperature of the Clyme chearishinge our people and produceinge by nature and industrie, what soever vsefull Co?odities are found in any knowne Country. 4The beneficiall ffishings discouered wch togeather wth the continuall enter- course betweene People of one and the same Nation is an exceedinge encrease of Nauiga?on. 5The multitudes and quantities of materiall? for the buildinge &amp; settinge forth of Shippinge beinge there in ?fec?on especially excellent Timber wherof great scarcitie is found throughout Christendome. 6The assurance of many rich Trades that by a Planta?on setled in those ?ts might be found out and dryven to the incredible benefitt of this Kingdome, besides noe small hopes of an easy and short passadge to the South Sea, either by Land or Sea. 7An inestimable advantadge, that would be gayned to this state of England in case of Warr both for the easie assaultinge of the Spanyards West Indies, from those parts, and for the relievinge and succouringe of all Shipps and men of Warr that should goe on Reprysalls, there beinge none of those daungers or disco?odities whatsoever that in former times ouerthrew soe many Voyadges butt wilbe by the Planta?ons of Virginia and Summer Islands supplyed and prevented; Soe that our benefitt and the enemies harme and loss wilbe certaine. Butt soe itt is that now when the naturall difficulties incydent to all new Plan- ta?ons are by tract of time and good dilligence, &amp; especially by the blessinge of Almighty God in great part overcom: Yett on the other side the vnnaturall and faultie impedyment? arysinge by ffaction and discord, runinge courses and practizes of some tendinge wholly to pryvate proffitt, misimployment of the Stocke, false Accompt? and the like diversions from the faire hopes in the Action are soe encreased and vpheld by strong hand as doth threaten speedy ruyne and destruc?on to this excellent worke of God and his Maty: if remedies be not timely applyed. Wee therfore the Counsell and Company (not a little differinge from other Companies both in our Composi?on consistinge of principall Noblemen, Gentle- men, merchants and others, and in the ends for wch it is established beinge not simply matter of Trade, butt of a higher Nature, yett findinge nevertheless our selvs in our body as itt is now distempered vnable to be our owne Phisi?ans without higher Assistance) doe thinke our selvs tyed in Conscience, Duty &amp; reputa?on and for the deliverance of our owne soules, and for dischardg of the trust reposed in vs to represent to this present Parlyament, this Childe of the Kingdome exposed as in the Wilderness to extreame daunger and as itt were fayntinge and labouringe for life. Humbly entreatinge this Honoble house to take into yor Comissera?on this Distressed Collony and oppressed Company and to be pleased to receive from such of his Maties Councell for Virginia (beinge members of yor Honoble house) as haue been appoynted by vs the Company a full rela?on of those oppressions and greivances wch though in sundry kindes (haue as they doubt not to make evydent) had either their originall [379] or strength from the now Lord Treasuror out of his pryvate and most vniust ends, not onely to allmost the vtter ouerthrow of this noble worke butt allsoe to the Deceipt of his Maty: in his proffitt and to the great preiudice of the wholl kingdome in matter of Trade, and daungerous consequence to the liberty of their ?sons. And thervppon accordinge to yor most graue wisedomes to devise some remedy for removeing of the impediment?, repressinge of the abuses encourradginge Adventurers and fynally for the establishment of the Collony. Wch beinge twice read after some pause the Company were desyred to speake freely to itt, and declare their opyneons whether they did approve therof as itt was, or would haue itt amended in any parte, or any thinge added therevnto: Whervppon allthough some tooke excep- ?ons to some ?ticulers therin, yett after great ?exact? Debate and Considera?on it was agreed and concluded by a generall erection of hands (onely one dissenting) that the Peti?on should stand as itt was drawen. And the Court entreated mr Deputy and those other of the Counsell that are allsoe members of the Honoble House of Parlyament would please in the Companies name to ?sent the said Peti?on to the house of Commons and to prosecute the matters therin conteyned with all expedi?on.1 1 The letter of the King to the Speaker of the House of Commons on this petition is mentioned in List of Records, No. 665, Vol. I, page 193, ante.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A Preparatiue Courte helde for Virginia on Munday in the afternoone ye: 26: of Aprill—1624. Present Sr Iohn Dauers. mr Ryder. mr Norwood. Sr Roger Twisden. mr Newporte. mr Sparrowe. mr Deputie. mr Boothbie. mr Cranmer. mr Iohn fferrar. mr Sheldone. mr Huddlestone. mr Shepparde. mr Barbor. mr Taylor. mr Bland. mr Casewell. mr Perrie. mr Palivicine.

Wheras Vrsula ffrench Peti?oned the Company for the freedome of one Elias Longe her Apprentize in regaurd hee had served out 4 years of his time and was noe waies able (as shee was informed) to pay her out of his wages that Propor?on of Tobacco towards her mayntenance as was formerly ordered, nor likely duringe his service to give her any releife: The Court in Considera?on of her povertie orders her case should be recommended to the Gouernor and Counsell of Virginia soe as some means might be found to give her releife speedilie. The Court vppoñ Mo?on ordered a Comission to be drawen vpp for Marmaduke Reyner for his Shipp the Sampson of about 100: Tunn for transport of good? and Passengers to Virginia. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that Wheras mr Iames Bagg of Plymouth had 5 shares given him by a Quarter Court the 25th of Ivne— 1620 as a gratifica?on for that good service hee had done for the Com- pany as appeares [380] in that Court: hee desyred hee might haue the said Shares confirmed vnto him vnder the Companies Seale. Wch request the Court held very reasonable and ordered a draught therof to be made against the Quarter Corte as had been §for§ others in the like kinde. Mr Deputy moved that wheras Sr ffraunces Wyat? Comission of Gouer- norpp of Virginia expired verie shortly, and that himselfe as appeared by his owne letter was willinge to resigne his place to some more wor- thie person The Company would therfore take a bethinkinge against the next Quarter Court for proposinge some other fitt man to succeed him: Whervppon divers of the Company declared their opynions that seeings Sr ffrauncis Wyatt had carryed himselfe soe worthylie in the place of Gouernor as appeared by the Report of the Planters themselves now present in Court much commendinge him for his Ius- tice and æquanimitie toward? all men. And consideringe allso how much the Company are in his Debt and noe means lefte to make good their promise vnto him, much lesse able to furnish out a new Gou- ernor, they could not therfore doe better then continue him still; whervppon the Court generally agreed to reco?end itt to the further Considera?on of the Quarter Court. Mr Deputy signified that beinge desired by the former Court to ?sent the Companys Peti?on to the Lower house of Parlyament, hee had this morninge (for before hee could not) preferred itt. Wherat there was at first some opposi?on made; but the house was pleased notwth standing to entertaine itt verie acceptably, and haue appoynted a select Co?ittee to hear itt, who are to meet in the Starr Chamber vppon the next Wednesday in the afternoone, wher all of the Com- pany that are members of the Parlyament are admitted freely to com and heare butt not to haue voyce. And now for soe much as this meetinge fell out vppon the Quarter Court day in the afternoone wher the Lord Cavendish himselfe and divers others of the Company were there to give their attendance vppon the said Co?ittee. And for that allsoe the Earle of Southamp- tõ their Treasuror was himselfe out of Towne, they were of neces- sitie to alter and transferr the vsuall time of keepinge their Court that day, from the afternoone to the forenoone Whervppon the Let- ters Patents beinge ?vsed itt playnly appeared itt was free for them soe to doe, and although by their owne Lawe they had appoynted their Court? to begin at two in the afternoone yett vppon soe greate and vnavoydable necessitie as now fell out itt was conceived the Com- pany had power to dispence wth that Law. [381] And itt was further offered to the Considera?on of the Court that wheras the Earle of Southampton had been Treasuror now allmost 4 years, itt was against the Lawe of the Company to choose him againe, and yett the necessitie and occasion of the Company were such as noe other fitt choyse could be made; Whervppon ye Court thought fitt to be humble suters to his Lop: that out of that extraordinary Noble Zeale wch hee had with soe much trouble and paynes Demonstrated, hee would be pleased be pleased once againe to accept of the place of Treasuror and for removeinge the Obstacle that was by the Com- panies Lawe, itt was thought fitt to suspend the force of that Lawe for this time; Whervppon ye Courte beinge acquainted that for the abrogatinge or suspension of a Lawe itt was to be done by the same stepps and ?degrees? as itt was made, did first appoynt a Co?ittee to advise about the suspen?on of those Lawes for the present, for wch purpose these were nominated. (vizt) mr Iohn fferrar mr Cranmer mr Whitley mr Ryder mr Pallavicine mr Copeland mr Casewell mr Cuffe mr Barbor who withdrawinge themselvs out of the Court and haueinge deliberated theron came and declared their opynions to those of the Counsell that were present who concurringe with them, and afterward the Court likewise, Itt was generally conceived very necessary and expedient (rebus sic stantibus) that those Lawes for begininge Court? att. 2. of the Clock in the afternoone and for lymittinge the Treasuror but for 3 years att once should be suspended for the present. Sr Thomas Hamon brought to the Court one Sydrac Soan, and Martha his sister who made claime vnto 3 shares due vnto their Brother Ioseph Soan deceased by a bill of Aduenture of 37li: 10: 00 paid vnto Sr Thomas Smith wch they say Ioseph Soane did devize by his will vnto one Ganesford Soane and the ?sd? Sydrack and Martha: wch Gainsford they certefie to be dead: So that the right now did wholly belong to them two. They allso presented the Coppie of the said Will wch Sr Thomas Hamon testified to be a true Coppie, Butt the Court beinge desyrous to see the bill of Aduenture, because there appeared butt 25li of itt acknowledged in the printed booke: Sydrack made answere hee had pawned the said bill for 30s to mr ffotherby. The Court at length ordered that the said Three shares should be ioyntly passed vnto the said Sydrack and Martha as beinge ioynt and Coheirs to ye said Inheritance. Mr Webb haueinge testefyed to the Court that mr Garrett Weston transported to Virginia att his owne charge his brother * * * * §ffrauncis§ Weston and three servants (vizt) William Dansey, Robert Miller, and Iames Bradford, The Court ordered that hee should haue the propor?on of 200 Acres allowed him for their ?sonall shares. There was brought to the Court an Indian Boy by one William Perry lately come ouer from Virginia, for whome a mo?on was made for some Contribu?on toward? his mayntenance, wherby to bring him vp in Christianitie and some good course to live by. Whervppon itt was thought fitt a Role be drawne for men to vnderwrite what they please freely to contribute that way. [382] Mr Richard Casewell made knowne to the Court that wheras Capt Iohn Bernard deceased had sould to mr Georg ffurzman three old Shares of 12li: 10s: 00 ? share and likewise supplyed them in Martins Hundred to the value of tenn pounds ? share Itt appeared afterwards to the Auditors that two of the said Shares were ye Inheritance of the heirs of mr Iohn Iames deceased, whose wife although Captaine Ber- nard had marryed yett hee could not therby alyenate those two shares from the aforesaid heirs: Wherfore to supply and make good againe, the full number of Shares that Captaine Bernard had assigned vnto the said George ffurzman mr Casewell declared that att the request of Capt: Bernard? Executors hee had assigned and past ouer to the said George ffurzman and his heirs for ever two Shares old Adventure of 12li: 10s ? share, And therfore desyred the Court to ratifie and confirme vnto the said George ffurzman as well the two shares hee had assigned and passed ouer vnto him as that other Share wch Captaine Bernard had sold him formerlie, and the Thirty pound? supplyed by Captaine Bernarde as aforesaid. So the Court takinge itt into their Considera- ?on haue accordinglie ratified and confirmed the said Three shares vnto mr George ffurzman and admitted him to be a ffreeman of the Company: And haue allso agreed and ordered that the said three shares shalbe the same, wch Captaine Io: Bernard in his life time drewe by lott in Martins Hundred as they are laid out and figured vnder his name in the Generall Mapp of ye said Society.</field>

[383] Mr Deputy made knowne to the Company what reasons moved the last Court vppon Consulta?on first had by a Co?ittee then appoynted, and after wth ye Counsell then allso present to order and appoynt the keepinge of the Quarter Court this day in the forenoone: wch course and altera?on was well approved of by this present Court. And in regard the Court was now accordinge to the dyrec?on of ye Letters Patents to proceed to elec?on of new Officers. mr Deputy breifley related the reasons yt had formerly moved them to continew their old Officers ever since the Quarter Court in May—1622. And for their better sattisfac?on read vnto them the seu9all passages in the seuerall Quarter Court? since touchinge that matter. And further signified that wheras the Company had made a Lawe for lymittinge the Treasuror and Deputy to continue in their places but for 3 years at once the said Law had allso been taken into considera- ?on by the former Co?ittee Counsell and Court, who conceavinge noe detryment could ensue to the Company by dispenceinge with that Lawe for the present, but rather a singuler benefitt and advantadge vnto them as things now stood, did therfore thinke fitt to suspend ye Lawe allsoe for the present by leavinge itt free for the Company to make choise of any former Officers although their times were determyned. Whervppon itt beinge taken into Considera?on by this present Court, after all reasons heard and debated, itt was at length agreed and ordered by a generall erection of hands that the Lawe concerninge the lymittinge of the Office of Treasuror and Deputy to the terme of 3 years should be suspended and accordingly resolvinge to goe to Elec- ?on, the Earle of Southampton was generally and vnanimously nomi- nated and beinge putt in Election with the Right Honoble the Lord Cauendish, the place fell to the Earle of Southampton by haueinge 69 balls, the Lord Cauendish: fiue and the Negatiue box. 2. whervppon ye Court besought the Lo: Cauendish and the rest of the Counsell present to acquainte his Lop: with this choyce and how humbly and instantly the Court besought his Lop: to accept therof. ffor Deputy mr Alderman Iohnson and mr Nicholas fferrar beinge proposed and ballated, the place fell to mr fferrar by haueinge 64 balls mr Alderman 10. and the negative box: 1. Whervppon mr fferrar beinge brought to his place tooke his Oath. Proceedinge next to the choyse of the Auditors, the Court by a generall rection of hands continued of the old, Sr Edwin Sandis, and Sr Iohn Dauers in respect of their sufficiencie and long experience in matters of Accompts with promise allso (vppon their request) that they should be no other wayes tyed herevnto then as their owne occasions would permitt. The Court likewise contynued mr Iohn fferrar and mr Keight- ley, and in regard mr Gibbes and mr Iohn Wroth had long discontinued from cominge to Court?, there were chosen in their steed mr Bland and mr Scott. Proceedinge next to the choyse of Co?ittees these five of the old were dismissed namely mr Bearblock. mr Darnelly mr Bland. mr Wheatley mr Mellinge [384] and in their steeds these five new were chosen (vizt) 1. mr Roberts. 6. mr Bull. 11. mr Boothbie. 2. mr Morris. 7. mr Casewell. 12. mr Bennett. 3. mr Ryder. vnto whome were added 8. mr Georg Smith. 13. mr Biddolph. 4. mr ffelgate. 9. mr Wiseman. 14. mr Seaward. 5. mr Kirbie. 10. mr Meuerell. 15. mr Barbor. 16. mr Covell. ffor Secretary—Edward Collingwood ffor Husband—mr Wm Webb were chosen by a generall erec?on of hands. ffor Beadle—Thomas Newton The last Court beinge made acquainted by mr Deputy wth that notice that Sr ffrauncis Wyatt had given by his owne letter of the time of the determina?on of his Co?ission of Gouernorship of Virginia and of his willinge desire to leaue that waightie burthen to some other more able person if the Company soe pleased. And beinge further informed allsoe by the Planters then present in Court howe much hee was Co?ended for his Iustice and æquanimitie towards all men who generally professed his Noble carriage was such as hee well deserued to be contynued in the place of Gouernor and to haue a iust recompence for those great losses hee had susteyned through want of his due number of Tenant? and otherwise since his goinge over. The Company beinge thus confirmed in their good opynion of him and withall consideringe they had no Stocke att all lefte to furnish out a new Gouernor conceived they were of necessity inforced to continue him still, and therfore thought fitt to propound him at this Quarter Court to stand in Elec?on for the said place. Whervppon Sr ffraunces Wyat beinge proposed by the Court, and some earnestlie moveinge that Sr Samuell Argall (in regard of his worth and desire therevnto) might stand in Elec?on with him they were both ballated and the place fell to Sr ffrauncis Wyat by haueinge 69 Balls, Sr Samuell Argall 8 and ye Negative box 2. And itt was likewise further ordered that a ?re should be writt vnto him to pray his acceptance of the said place for 3 years longer, and further to assure him that the Company would be verie carefull to giue him a due Supply of Tenant? in discharge of their promise and Covenant? wth him att his first goinge ouer. The Court was moved that wheras in the generall narra?on that was this afternoone to be made before the Co?ittee of the lower house of Parlyament there would fall out divers passages touchinge Sr Nathaniell Rich who beinge a member of that house itt was not fitt to charge him without leave first obteyned. Therfore that the Company would please to peti?on the house, that hee might be ordered to be present at the said Co?ittee and here such charges as should be given him. wch course beinge well liked of by the Court and a peti?on to that effect presented: itt was twise read and maturelie considered of: and beinge approved was by a generall erec?on of hands (two onely dis- sentinge) ordered to be presented to the house in the name of the Company: And that if itt should com there too late, then to present itt to the Co?ittee in the afternoone. [385] Request beinge made by some that Sr Nathaniell Rich might haue a Coppie of ye said Peti?on Itt was by a generall erection of hands (saue two) denyed itt beinge the Custome of noe Court whatsoever. The Court takinge into Considera?on that the matters to be delivered to the Parlyament did fall vnder fower generall heads (vizt) the Matter of Tobacco and all the greivances therin: The buisines of the Contract, The proceedings of the Comissioners and the passadges since, and conceivinge that neither Counsell att Lawe could be soe fully informed as were requisite, and ?happs would not be soe well heard, did therefore thinke fitt to beseech the Lord Cauendish Sr Edwin Sandis and Sr Iohn Dauers to take vppon them the delivery of the three last part?, (vizt) The Lord Cauendish the buissines of the Comission, Sr Edwin Sandys that of the Contract, and Sr Iohn Dauers the last: And for ye matter of Tobacco they imposed itt vppon mr Deputy. His Lop: very Nobly vouchsaffed to promise his ?formance of their desires, and the like did the other of their part?. The Court beinge moved that some course might be taken for the Educa?on and bringinge vpp of the Indian boy that was lately brought ouer from Virginia by one William Perry, did thervppon entreate mr Copeland a Mynister to take him into his care and charge: And did promise hee should haue allowance for his entertaynement. The Graunt of fiue shares vnto mr Iames Bagg of Plymouth beinge ordered by the last Court to be drawen vpp was now presented and read and beinge approved was ordered to be sealled. Mr Casewell moved the Court that the two shares wch hee had passed to mr ffurzman att the last Court as likewise one other share sold him by Capt Bernard, might be the same Three shares that Captaine Bernard drew in his life time in Martins Hundred as they are figured out in the generall Mapp of yt Societie wch request the Court condi- scended vnto and ratified and confirmed the said 3 shares in Martins Hundred accordingly vnto mr ffurzman.</field>

The Court of the 21th of Aprill was now read and after some pause and noe [386] exception taken therto, beinge putt to the Question itt was by a generall erec?on of hands approved to be rightly sett downe. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that although the generall buisiness of the Company preferred in their Peti?on had not ?ceeded in Par- lyament, yett the ?ticuler of Tobacco by the exceedinge greate care and wisedome of Sr Edwin Sandys assisted with the Lord Cauendish and other worthy members of the Company had a verie happie issue. The Importa?on of fforraigne Tobacco wherin Spanish was included beinge presented to his Matie: as one of the nyne greivances of the Realme in the matter of Trade wherin the House humbly besought releife and that for the good of England without any Men?on or rela- tion to Virginia in their Peti?on,—although hee said hee Doubted not but in their heart? the wholl House had a very speciall regaurd to the advancement of the Planta?ons. And as this course was in itt selfe as effectuall as if itt had been done by bill to obteyne ye excluding of Spanish Tobacco, soe itt was much better then if itt had been done by the bill wch was Drawen the last Parlyament, since wch time the state &amp; price of Tobacco was soe much altered as itt could noe way now beare that charge of 12d ? pound wch that bill laide on itt butt therby the Comoditie would haue been as certainely ruyned and ouerthrowen as any otherwise. In wch reguard mr Deputy professed that neither himselfe nor divers others could with any good courrage sett forward? that course of the bill. But this second way bringinge with itt all the good of the bill, and leavinge out the evill therof hee thought it could not bee too much commended nor Sr Edwin Sandis (to whome the Company was behold- inge therfore) sufficiently thanked.1 1 Among the Ferrar Papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, are several drafts of acts and petitions on trade in the writing of Nicholas Ferrar, and nearly of this date. See also List of Records, Nos. 667–670, 672, 676, and 677, Vol. I, pages 193, 194, ante. The Court rested much sattisfied in this matter, and full of good hope that itt would com to a good end. Butt beinge informed that those seuerall parties who in other kindes were to receave benefitt from the redress of the other head? of greivances had seconded the House wth their ?ticuler Peti?ons to his Matie: The Court thought itt very neces- sary and fitt that the Company should doe the like and soe much the rather in regard that the House of Commons haveinge onelie Peti- ?oned for the generall good of Trade wth out refferrence to Virginia the addi?on ?of? so weightie, and mayne, a considera?on as the vphold- inge &amp; advauncemt of the Planta?ons would in all probabillitie much sett forward the Execution and ?formance therof: Whervppon itt was ordered that a Peticon should be drawen to his Matie: to be presented from the Quarter Court, pursuinge the effect of that wch the House of Commons had delivered with the Addi?on of what ?ticularly con- cerned the Planta?ons. And further itt was ordered that their Lops: promise vppon dissolu?on of the Contract (that the Planta?ons onely should haue the Importa?on of Tobacco) should be men?oned: wch their Lops by their order bearinge date the 28 of Aprill 1623 did com- maund should be signified to the Colony §as§ haveing been most graciously graunted by his Maty: vppon their Lops Mo?on. ffor the drawinge vpp of this Peti?on the Court appoynted mr Deputy, mr Casewell, mr George Smith, and further intreated Sr Edwin Sandys to give them his help therin. Mr Deputy acquainted the Company hee received late notice of Three Shipps newly arryved from Virginia wch had made a very speedy pas- sage and hadd brought good news from thence (viz) that the people were all in health and the Colloney well stored with Corne and other provisions. Hee likewise made knowne how much Sr ffraunces Wyat was Co?- ended for [387] his good service and noble Carriage of himselfe in his Government. And moved that seeings the Company had againe chosen him for Gouernor for 3 years longer they would also consider how to supply him for the time to com with his iust number of Ten- ant? and to recompence him for the losse hee hath susteyned therby. Wch beinge taken into Considera?on itt was held both iust &amp; reason- able that the Company should make good their Contract with him. And thervppõ by a generall erec?on of hands agreed and ordered that signification should be given vnto him of his reelection. And in respect the Company wanted means to send over more men vnto him hee should be supplyed with his full number out of the Compa- nies Tenants there; And for to recompence his former losses itt was referred to the Considera?on of the Quarter Courte. Vppon the like mo?on and request in the behalfe of mr George Sandis Treasuror, It was agreed and ordered by a generall erec?on of hands (onely one dissentinge) that those men wch the Company had promised to send him, but wanted means to make itt good, should be now like- wise supplyed out of the Companies Tenants. Mr Bull Treasuror for the old Magazine moved that wheras mr Alder- man Iohnson hath ffower Hundred and odd pound? remayninge in his hands long since due to the Magazine Adventurers whose Accompt in respect of some differrences was referred to mr Alderman Ham- mersley and mr Wither to examine and arbytrate: that for soe much as mr Withers was gone beyound Sea they would now therfore appoynt some other in his steed: and the rather for that mr Alder- man Iohnson is tyed to give an Accompt before August next. This was referred to the Quarter Court to consider of. Memorand.
