      <field name="fulltext">James Alexander The author of these sketches was born in Boston, Massachusetts, March 4, 1804, the eldest son of James Alexander and Elizabeth Williston, his wife. In Memoirs which he prepared for his descendants he states that he came of early colonial stock. His maternal greatgrandmother was Ann Brown McMillan, a direct descendant of John(?) Brown who came over in the Mayflower in 1620. This early ancestor served as town crier for the village of Boston and his descendants are buried in the old Copps Hill Cemetery, "from the first settlement of that place." According to the Memoirs, "My father James Alexander was a member of the Antient and Honorable Artillery Company. Its original designation was The Military Company of Massachusetts. It was also styled at different periods The Great Artillery and The Artillery Company. The name Antient and Honorable Artillery was not applied until 1720. No military organization can dispute its title to be the oldest band of citizen-soldiery in America, the company was formed in 1637. A charter was granted in 1638. The first commander Capt. Keayne. I also became a member and did escort duty when Lafayette visited Boston in 1824. I was first Corporal. The reception of General Lafayette was one of the most brilliant occasions that ever took place in Boston. William Alexander the elder brother of my father was captain of this company in 1805. . . . My father's ancestors were attendants at the New North Church." James Alexander learned printing in Boston and completed his four-year apprenticeship in 1825. He came to Charlottesville in December, 1828, to assist in printing the Memoir, Correspondence and Miscellanies . . . of Thomas Jefferson, edited by Thomas Jefferson Randolph of Edgehill. In December, 1832, Alexander married Rebecca Ann Wills at old Rose Hill near Charlottesville. After a few years of newspaper editing in Abingdon, where he published the Virginia Republican in the early 1830's, he returned to Charlottesville. This was his home until his death, October 20, 1887. In addition to editing the Jeffersonian Republican, which he founded in 1835, Alexander did considerable publishing for the University of Virginia, including the early magazine The Museum. Having always strong antiquarian tastes, he wrote a history of the Albemarle County court house, of which only one copy is known to survive and that with many pages gone. During the War between the States he served as treasurer for the City of Charlottesville and a record exists of his handling of Monies for Soldiers in 1861. In the 1870's he was local editor of his old paper, the Jeffersonian Republican. Suspended in the spring of 1862 because of war conditions, it did not resume publication until 1873. It was during 1873-74 that he wrote his Recollections of Charlottesville, now reprinted. He was a man of strong religious interests, brought up in the Episcopal communion, but having joined the Baptist church before coming to Virginia. Although a native of New England, Alexander became a thorough southerner and in 1860-61 his newspaper was ardently pro-secessionist. He retained connections, however, with his northern kin and in 1877 he was visited by his cousin and school-boy chum, Francis Smith, author of our national hymn, "America." This poet, upon his return to Massachusetts, wrote: "I shall always think of Virginia as the land of November roses." Alexander had two sons and three daughters. Both sons gave their lives in the service of the Confederacy. The elder, James Butler Sigourney Alexander, was graduated from West Point in 1856 in the class with Fitzhugh Lee, with the signature of Jefferson Davis— then Secretary of War—on his lieutenant's commission. He was on duty in Washington Territory at the outbreak of the war and resigned at once to enter the Army of Northern Virginia as Captain. Contracting typhoid fever, he died in West Virginia in 1861. The second son, W. W. Alexander, was educated at Colonel Strange's Military Academy in Charlottesville. He had just entered business as a druggist with his shop "across from the Post Office at the University," when the war began, but he volunteered at once and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. He was killed in the last battle of the Confederacy. The male line of the family thus became extinct, but through the marriage of the daughters a number of descendants survive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recollections of James Alexander As Printed in The Jeffersonian Republican charlottesville, virginia December 17, 1873 Forty-Five Years Ago.—The Local of the Jeffersonian is disposed to tell some yarns of former times in this Virginia town, named after her majesty, Queen Charlotte, who bore George the Third, King of Great Britain, thirteen children. The Square.—The land on which the courthouse is erected, and the vacant plat in front of it was the gift1 1. There is no record of this gift. Though it is mentioned in an article by Natalie Disbrow, "Thomas Walker of Albemarle County," published in Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, Vol. I (1940-41), p. 14, examination of the three citations shows there is no reference in them to a gift, and those most familiar with the subject discredit the idea. For the site of the town the county purchased one thousand acres, stretching from Cochran's Pond on the north to Moore's Creek, and from what is now E. Seventh Street to Preston Heights. Dr. Walker was largely instrumental in this step, and was appointed Trustee to handle the buying of land and laying off of lots. The original town contained four tiers of lots upon the eastern edge of the tract, extending east and west, and from Jefferson to South Streets. Each tier comprised seven one-acre squares, and each square was divided into two lots. The court house, as county property, was located outside the town on the immediate northern edge, and at first its lot was not bordered by streets, it being intended to reproduce an English green, with houses facing directly upon it. This proving impracticable, the county later laid off from its grounds a street on each side of the building. It is believed still to retain rights to this land to the further curb, but has never assumed jurisdiction, not even of the side-walks adjoining its grounds. The Jackson Park Tract, also, is controlled by the city. Edgar Woods, Albemarle County in Virginia . . . [Charlottesville, Va., 1901], p. 27; data from W. L. Maupin and Judge Lemuel F. Smith. of Dr. Thomas Walker, the grandfather of Mrs. W. C. Rives, who had the town laid off in lots in 1761-'62, and which was incorporated by the House of Burgesses, November, 1762. In 1828, when we first saw the Square, there was on the west side of it a row of locust trees, in front of the stores [McKee block], which had been set out fifteen or twenty years previously, only one of which is now standing, in front of Dr. McKee's residence. These trees had been planted by a man by the name of Shadrach Battles, who was half Indian, half mulatto; his pay for the work was to be a quart of whisky for every tree that lived. He watched them carefully and watered them to aid in their growth, and when any of them gave evidence of life by putting forth leaves he would clap his hands and shout, "Another quart saved." The persons who did business on that side paid the contractor as per agreement. All the stores in town sold ardent spirits, and kept open doors on Sunday mornings till 10 o'clock, except John Cochran, to traffic and trade with the slaves, who came to town with written permits from their masters to dispose of their garden truck, &amp;c. When the late Benjamin Ficklin, a magistrate, settled in town, he was the means of breaking up this Sunday traffic and to the plea that humanity required that the slaves should be allowed to buy and sell on Sunday, because they had no other time to do it in, he said it was against the laws of the State to labor or do business on the Sabbath, and if masters wished their servants to sell what little products they had, they should give them time enough to do so on Saturday afternoon, and not on the Sabbath. Mr. Ficklin enforced the laws and fined those who violated them; on one occasion, when his manager drove his team to town on Sunday, he went before another magistrate and had a fine entered against himself, and he made a lawyer pay a fine of $5 on admitting that he wrote business letters on Sunday. Twyman Wayt did business on the south-west corner, now the tobacco factory2 2. This was the first of a row of houses which ran north and south on what is now Jackson Park. They faced east towards the court house on a lane with trees and hitching posts and were once buildings of importance. They became known as the McKee block, and the north end gradually declined into a forlorn rookery. (Here "Colonel Crack," a demented but harmless Negro, whose passion was uniforms, decorations and the unauthorized leading of all public parades, long lived.) These buildings were razed to make way for Mr. Paul G. McIntire's gift in 1921 of the Stonewall Jackson statue. The Wayt house was for a while occupied by the academy of Col. John Bowie Strange before the school's removal to Ridge Street. of Captain C. C. Wertenbaker. Mr. Wayt many years afterwards was Post Master, and lived to be upwards of 80 years of age. No man was more highly respected than he for purity, fairdealing and integrity. Next door to him lived and carried on business, Andrew McKee, the hatter, the father of Dr. A. R. McKee, who resides in the same house. Both the above houses are brick. The next house is wood,3 3. This building was brought from Milton, and possessed the "sway" characteristic of these transplanted dwellings. It was later called the Central Hotel. (Authority: W. L. Maupin.) with a porch and veranda above it, and for many years previously had been kept as a hotel, and was built by Thos. Wells, the father of Fountain Wells, and by way of distinction was called the "Yellow House." It was then occupied, one room of it, next to Mr. McKee, by George Toole, the tailor, an Irishman with a warm heart, generous feelings, an enthusiastic Democrat in politics, and one of the best of citizens. The next store was occupied by Bramham &amp; Bibb, dry goods merchants and grocers. Colonel Nimrod Bramham, one of the partners, had been a member of the Virginia Legislature, was a popular man, and one of Virginia's hospitable noblemen. His residence was on the farm now owned by Rev. James Fife, near the University of Virginia. He was a christian by word and deed, a Baptist, and baptized by the celebrated John Leland,4 4. John Leland (1754-1838) was born in Grafton, Mass. He was an active and eloquent minister, a writer of political and religious pamphlets. He lived for about fifteen years as a young man in Culpeper and Orange counties, Virginia. He calculated in his old age that he had baptized 1524 persons. James B. Taylor, Virginia Baptist Ministers . . . (2 vols., Richmond, Va., [etc.] 1837-59), Vol. II, pp. 30-41. the zealous advocate of the election of Thomas Jefferson as President in 1800. Colonel B. was one of the constituent members of the Baptist Church in this place and its elder deacon. Mr. Wm. A. Bibb, the other partner, resided in the house over the store and carried on business there for many years. He was the first cashier of the Farmers' Bank in this place, to the time of his death, September, 1865, and was as honest and worthy a man as ever resided in our town. His wife was Sarah Bramham, the eldest daughter of his partner. The next store and house, brick,5 5. This house was built of 9-inch brick in Flemish bond, and its construction was so sound that upon its demolition the contractor found it impossible to "throw" the walls and they were taken down brick by brick. A number of gold coins were found in the debris. (Authority: W. L. Maupin.) were occupied by John Simpson, and afterwards by Christopher Hornsey and John W. Goss, dry goods merchants; the latter gentleman is now the clerk of the county court; in later years it was occupied by the Farmers' Bank. Mr. Simpson married Lucy Bramham, a daughter of Col. Bramham. He was a worthy and good man, was a deacon in the Baptist Church. The next house, a wooden building, was occupied by Samuel Leitch, Sr., usually called Uncle Sam. He was by birth an Irishman, kind, hospitable, sociable and a good citizen. He was a zealous Mason, and in his latter days became a member of the Presbyterian church. He was the father of Dr. James A. Leitch, and grandfather of J. S. Leitch, one of the proprietors of the Jeffersonian. He had for clerk and business manager Andrew Sample, one of the most genial and pleasant men that it was ever our happiness to know. Every boy and girl in the town and vicinity knew "Cousin Andy," and he loved them all, and ever greeted them with smiles and cheerfulness. Next to Mr. S. Leitch, was the house where the life6 6. Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies, from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson. Edited by Thomas Jefferson Randolph. 4 vols. Charlottesville, published by F. Carr and Co., 1829. and correspondence of Thomas Jefferson was printed; there were four iron presses at work in the printing, on the first floor, and the compositors room was above. Ten thousand copies of four volumes each were completed within a few months, and we aided in the work. The late Ebenezer Watts was the bookbinder. The Virginia Advocate, and successor to the Central Gazette, was published on the ground-floor, or cellar, of the same building. Dr. Frank Carr, a gentleman of fine literary taste and classic erudition, was the editor of the Advocate. The gentlemen associated with him as proprietors were J. A. G. Davis, afterwards professor of law in the University of Virginia, and Nicholas P. Trist, Esq. who married a sister of Colonel Thomas Randolph, and was United States Peace Commissioner to Mexico, after General Scott had captured the city of Mexico, when peace was made between the United States and this country. The editors who succeeded Dr. Carr, were, E. M. Reinhart, a native of Massachusetts, who had established in Haverhill, in that state, in 1824, the first paper to advocate the election of General Jackson to the presidency. He married a daughter of Dabney Minor, of this county, and afterwards removed to Louisville, Kentucky, and was connected with the Press in that place. In the latter part of General Jackson's term as President he gave Mr. Reinhart a clerkship. Mr. Reinhart had often solicited an appointment from the President, who assured him that he should fill the first vacancy that occurred in the War Department, but none occurring, Mr. R. told the President to put in writing, directing the head of the Department to give him an office if there was a vacant clerkship. This had the desired effect, and Mr. Reinhart got the office immediately upon presenting the letter, with the well known signature of Andrew Jackson. Mr. Reinhart sold the Advocate to W. M. Cary, J. W. C. Watson, now living in Mississippi, and was a member of the Confederate Senate during the late war, and E. Watson, who served several years in the Virginia Legislature, and in later years elected Judge of the Circuit Court. Then Alexander Moseley succeeded as editor. Mr. M. has been since then proprietor and editor of the Richmond Whig. William Tompkins followed, then Allen B. Magruder, then Lucian Minor, in 1840, when the Advocate undertook to give one-half of the paper to the Democratic side and the other to the Whig side, but this not succeeding, Thomas Wood became editor; after him, James C. Halsall and Wm. Shelton, became editors and proprietors; both these gentlemen were afterwards instructors of youths. John L. Cochran, now Judge of the county court, and O. S. Allen became proprietors. Mr. Cochran was the editor. The office was sold to Green Peyton, now Proctor of the University, and James C. Southall, since editor of the Richmond Enquirer, who changed the paper's name to the Review. The war breaking out, the Review ceased to be published, and the printing materials were sold and conveyed to Richmond. In 1864, Marshall J. Hughes brought his office from Knoxville, Tennessee, and established the Chronicle. It was for awhile edited by Rev. J. C. Hiden, then hospital chaplain in this place, and afterwards by J. C. Southall, who purchased the office of Mr. Hughes after the war ended, and continued to edit it till June, 1868. While Mr. Southall was a member of the State Convention the Chronicle was edited by Bennett Taylor, who in conjunction with John H. Foster, purchased it. Mr. Taylor in April, 1871, sold out his interest to his partner, Mr. Foster, who became sole proprietor and editor. The paper was published tri-weekly and weekly after the war, and for a short time daily, but the daily not proving successful, the paper was enlarged and in February, 1873, was sold to the present proprietors, Messrs. C. D. Fishburne, James D. Jones, Micajah Woods, James B. Gilmer and C. R. C. Ackerley, Mr. Fishburne assuming the editorial control of the paper. December 24, 1873 Forty-Five Years Ago.—On the north side of the Public Square was situated the stone jail; at that time no high walls, as at the present day, enclosed any part of it. The jailor was William Watson, who carried on the business of saddler and harness making in one of the rooms on the lower floor. He owned and had for his residence the house1 1. 415 Park Street. on Park Street,2 2. This street received its name from the fact that it led to the Park Mill, north of the town and owned by Dr. George Gilmer of Pen Park. Later, it was Cochran's Mill, and Cochran's Pond was a favorite skating place for two generations. The miller's old stone house still stands. now the property of Thomas Wood, Esq. Next to the jail was the Court House,3 3. Following the removal of the county seat from Scottsville to Charlottesville, 1762, a courthouse of slight and temporary construction, but with a portico, was erected, probably near the site of the present Clerk's Office. In The Court House of Albemarle County, by W. Sam Burnley, ([n. p.], 1939), pp. 6-7, we learn that a paper, discovered in 1938 in a closet of the Clerk's Office, proved to be the bond of William Cabell, dated Nov. 13, 1762, with John Harvie his security in the sum of one thousand pounds, for the building of this courthouse. It was to reproduce the Henrico courthouse, with the exception of a certain floor laid in eight-inch tile where its model used flagstone. The cost was to be three hundred and seventy-five pounds, ten shillings. The courthouse at Scottsville had been a copy of that of Goochland, and was "thirty-six feet long and twenty feet wide, from outside to outside" (Mary Rawlings, Ante-Bellum Albemarle [Charlottesville, Va., 1935], p. 32), so we may assume that this new one was no smaller. In 1803 the north or rear wing of the present building was erected. Geo. Divers, Wm. D. Meriwether and Isaac Miller were appointed to draw the plan, the cost not to exceed five thousand dollars. The committee was also directed, when the new house was finished, to remove the old one, with the rubbish incident to the work. This north wing long served as the town's public building, and the churches of the community used it in rotation. The Court Square was first enclosed in 1792, Pillory, stocks and whipping post stood here, and as late as 1857 the whipping post was restored. In 1825 a commission, consisting of Joseph Coffman, John M. Perry, John Winn, Alexander Garrett, Micajah Woods and Opie Norris was directed to have two offices erected on the northeast corner of the Square for the commonwealth's attorney and the sheriff, and in 1855 an engine house was built on the west side of the Square and two offices in line with it on the east side. A front, much ornamented with towers and gables, was built in 1859, and after the War between the States this was altered by George W. Spooner into the present front with columns. See Woods, Albemarle County, p. 83. not then enclosed with iron railings. Archibald Stuart,4 4. Judge Stuart was educated at the College of William and Mary and fought in the Revolutionary army. During his entire army service he carried with him the official seal of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, of which he was vice-president. Years after his death, this was found in a secret drawer of his desk. When the Society was revived in 1849, his son transferred the seal to the officers, but since the Civil War days it has been lost sight of. Judge Stuart served in the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate, as a presidential elector, and as member of the Convention of 1788. Lyon G. Tyler, ed., Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography (5 vols., New York, 1915), Vol. II, pp. 153-54. of Augusta county, was the judge of the Superior Court, till the new constitution of 1829-30 went into effect. Since then5 5. In 1885—a decade after the original publication of these Recollections—John M. White was appointed to this office, which he filled with distinction until his death in 1913. Judge White was born in Norfolk County, Va. As a boy he ran away from the Virginia Military Institute to join Mosby's command, with which he fought through the remainder of the war. In addition to his legal work he was a successful business man, having been president of the Peoples National Bank for nearly twenty years. Exofficio, he was head of the Miller Manual School, to which he gave much time, and he was also active in the affairs of the Episcopal Church. Philip Alexander Bruce et al., History of Virginia, (6 vols., Chicago and New York, 1924), Vol. IV, p. 181. the judges have been Lucas P. Thompson, of Augusta, Richard Field, of Culpeper, Egbert R. Watson,6 6. Egbert R. Watson was the son of John Watson of "Forest Hill," near Milton. He studied law under Judge Hay, President Monroe's son-in-law, while serving as Mr. Monroe's secretary at Oak Hill in Loudoun County. He was admitted to the Charlottesville bar in 1830, represented the county in both Houses of the Virginia legislature, and served as Judge of the Circuit Court following the War between the States. He was an elder in the Presbyterian Church. of this county, and the present incumbent, Henry Shackelford, of Culpeper county. The clerk of this and the County Court was Alexander Garrett,7 7. John M. Carr, grandson of Major Thomas Carr, preceded Alexander Garrett as Clerk of the Circuit Court. He served nine years, resigning in 1818. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 79. who had for his deputy, many years, his brother, Ira Garrett, who entered the Clerk's office as far back as 1807 or 1808, and in 1830 was appointed clerk of the County Court and after the adoption of the revised constitution of the State, which went into effect in 1852, and which gave the election to the people, was elected clerk of both the Circuit and County Courts. He held these offices till displaced by Gen. Canby,8 8. Gen. Edward R. S. Canby was Military Commander of "District No. I," as Virginia was designated during the reconstruction period. Mr. Garrett, however, was removed from office (for refusal of the iron-clad test oath) under Gen. George Stoneman, Canby's predecessor. Ibid., pp. 121-122. and afterwards served as assistant to Dr. Points, the clerk. Mr. Garrett lived till he was nearly eighty years of age, and we believe, for the sixty odd years that he was in the Clerk's office, never was absent more than once or twice from any session of the Courts, during all that time; and his office was never closed during office hours. Mr. Garrett was not only attentive to business but accurate, gentlemanly, polite and courteous. The County Court, in 1828, and onwards, numbered among its justices some of the most substantial and best citizens in the county. We call to mind the following: Dr. Charles Brown, now living, in his 91st year, and at the present time in England, prosecuting his claims as heir to the Jennings estate of several millions of pounds sterling; Col. Samuel Carr9 9. Col. Samuel Carr of the Dunlora family was an officer of cavalry in the War of 1812 and nephew of Jefferson. His brother owned Carrsbrook. Col. Carr served in the State Senate for the terms 1837-1839, succeeding Dr. Charles Cocke, who served 1831-35, and also 1840-1843. elected State Senator in 1835, Col. William Woods, James Jarman, Garrett White, John Watson, father of Judge E. R. Watson, Micajah Woods, John Rodes, Opie Norris, William D. Meriwether, Col. John R. Jones, Dr. Frank Carr, Col. Th. J. Randolph, Benjamin Ficklin, and Dr. Charles Cocke, for several years State Senator. The lawyers then practising at the bar were, Philip P. Barbour,10 10. Of Orange County.

William F. Gordon, member of both Houses of the Virginia Legislature, and also of the United States House of Representatives. He first proposed the subtreasury system, or management of its finances by the separate instrumentalities of the Government, without the aid of Banks. And when this policy was afterwards urged by the Gov't the honor of having originated it was universally accorded him; Cha's Downing, in later years a member of Congress from Florida. He was a fluent speaker and gifted writer. He wrote the account of the visit of Gen. Lafayette to Mr. Jefferson, and his reception by the people of this county, and the dinner given to him at the University in 1824; Thos. W. Gilmer,13 13. Thomas Walker Gilmer must have been a colorful individualist. Upon his election as Governor he toured the State to examine all public works, defraying all expenses from private funds. In one year he resigned, following the failure of the legislature to support him in a dispute with New York State. He was at once elected to Congress. Died at age of forty-one. Ibid., Vol. II, p. 53. elected in 1829, and for years afterwards, to the Virginia House of Delegates, Governor of Virginia in 1840, and elected to the United States House of Representatives next year, then appointed by President Tyler, Secretary of Navy, and lost his life on board of the Princeton, by the bursting of the monster gun. Valentine W. Southall, for many years Commonwealth's Attorney, member of the Virginia Legislature, and of the Convention, which passed the act of Secession from United States in 1861; Rice W. Wood, elected to the house of Delegates in 1829, he died a few years thereafter, greatly lamented by the whole community; Boucher Carr, Commonwealth's attorney, he was a man so conscientious in the discharge of his duty, that he refused to engage in the prosecution of a person whom he believed not guilty, or to defend one that he felt satisfied was guilty; Henry T. Harris, Francis B. Dyer, John M. Martin, Wm. H. Meriwether, J. A. G. Davis, afterwards Professor of Law in the University of Virginia, and was shot by a student in November, 1840, from the effects of which he died. Alexander Rives, now United States District Judge, was, we think, in 1829, the junior member of the Albemarle bar; Maj. James Garland, member of the Legislature for Nelson County, and of the U. S. House of Representatives from this district, and at the present time judge of the court in Lynchburg and is in the 82d year of his age. Thomas J. Michie,14 14. This eminent jurist studied law in the office of his uncle, Chapman Johnson. He was the father of five sons, four of whom lost their lives in the Confederate army. His surviving son, Henry Bowyer Michie, in his later years lived here and edited the Charlottesville Chronicle. He was the father of Armistead Rust Michie and the late Thomas J. Michie of the law publishing firm, The Michie Company of Charlottesville, and of the late George R. B. Michie of the Peoples National Bank. Descendants of the Staunton lawyer to the fourth generation are among our citizens. of Staunton, also practised in the courts here for many years, and was prosecuting attorney in the Superior Court. In 1826 John Watson, Esq. was high sheriff, Nelson Barksdale farmed the office, and with Col. J. J. Bowcock and J. Frank Fry, were the deputy sheriffs for the two years. In 1828 Wm. D. Meriwether was high sheriff, and William Garland and Meredith Jones farmed the office, and were the deputy sheriffs for the term of two years. The senior Magistrate, in those days, was the high sheriff for the term of two years, who generally farmed out the office for a money consideration, but could, if he desired, perform the duties himself. In 1852, the people, for the first time, elected the sheriffs. The first election that we witnessed was in April, 1829. W. C. Rives was elected to Congress, Th. W. Gilmer and Rice W. Wood to the House of Delegates and Gen. Wm. F. Gordon to the State Senate; Hugh Nelson,15 15. Born at Yorktown, 1768, son of Governor Nelson. Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, Judge of the General Court, in Congress, 1811-1823, Minister to Spain, 1823-1824. Made his home at Belvoir, Albemarle County. Died, 1836.

Now the Red Land Club, corner of Park Street and East Jefferson. Of the Jouetts, Woods' Albemarle County, pp. 240-41, tells us: "Among the earliest entries on the Court records in 1745, is a notice of the death of Matthew Jouett, and the appointment of John Moore as his executor. It can scarcely be doubted that John Jouett, who was for many years a prominent citizen of Charlottesville, was a son of this Matthew. In 1773 John purchased from John Moore one hundred acres adjoining the town on the east and north, and at that time most likely erected the Swan Tavern of famous memory. . . . In 1790 he laid out High Street, with the row of lots on either side. . . . He kept the Swan until his death in 1802. . . . At the time of his death, and for many years after, no public place of burial in the town existed. According to the custom of that day, he was most probably buried in the yard in the rear of his house, and his remains lie somewhere in the square on which the old Town Hall is situated. . . . The general tradition about Charlottesville has always been, that it was John Jouett, Sr., who performed the exploit of outstripping Tarleton. . . . As to the grave of the elder Jouett, there is a cluster of fine old box in the rear of the Matacia home, 610 East High Street (to the rear of the Town Hall), which is believed to mark the site of the burial plot, the grave, according to belief, being within ten feet of a spot now marked by a cherry tree. there stood an old dilapidated building that had, prior to the Revolution, and down to almost the year 1828, been occupied as a tavern, and was known as the Swan Tavern. The landlord of this house was John Jouette, whose son in 1781, had been down the country, and was returning, when he had a sight of General Tarleton and his troop of cavalry, on their way to this town to capture Mr. Jefferson, whom they believed to be Governor of Virginia,17 17. Jefferson was Governor at this time. The raid occurred June 3-4, 1781; in the excitement which followed, criticism of Mr. Jefferson arose, and on June 12 a resolution was introduced in the House of Delegates that "an inquiry be made into the conduct of the Executive of this State for the last twelve months". It was made, and the Governor was unanimously exonerated of all blame, the chief mover, George Nicholas, becoming from this time one of his close friends and supporters. Mr. Jefferson, however, refused to stand for re-election. Lyon G. Tyler et al., History of Virginia (6 vols., Chicago and New York, 1924), Vol. II, pp. 212-13. and the members of the legislature, then in session in Charlottesville. Young Jouette rode a fleet horse, and by taking a route shorter than the main road, reached Charlottesville in time to give warning of the approach of the enemy, thus enabling Mr. Jefferson and family, and all the members of the Legislature, except two or three, to make their escape, and saving them from being captured by the British troops. This Mr. Jouette, years afterward, emigrated to the State of Kentucky, and was made a Judge at Law. In 1808, a man by the name of John (called Jack) M'Coy, was barkeeper in this Swan tavern; he was murdered and thrown into the well on the premises. The landlord, who was absent on the night that the murder occurred, was accused of being concerned in it, but he was acquitted. The late Ira Garrett was a boarder in the house at the time, and was a witness in the case when it was investigated by the court. No clue as to who committed the murder was ever afterwards obtained. On the vacant lot adjoining the hotel there was a battery; where men and boys played ball; quoits were pitched and marbles played. It was not unusual to see men of fifty and boys of ten or twelve playing together. This was a general resort for recreation, especially two or three hours before sunset. On a square or two north of this, on Sunday evenings, young men and boys sometimes resorted to exercise their limbs in jumping. December 31, 1873 It would be highly interesting, entertaining and instructive, if some of our older citizens, natives of the place, were to write for publication their recollections of what they had seen, or what they had learned from their parents and predecessors, respecting persons, places and events—traditions from the earlier settlements down to the present period. We have tried and urged several persons, well versed on these subjects, to enter upon the work, and hope they may yet do so. The Historical Society in the State of Wisconsin, once a part of Virginia, through its secretary, Lyman C. Draper, Esq., has been, and is now, engaged in collecting facts and incidents in the lives of men who lived here over one hundred years ago down to a third of a century since. If Wisconsin feels so great an interest in the men of past days, who lived among us, ought not we, who tread the soil these worthies cultivated, foster their memories, and leave to those who come after us, a record of their deeds, virtues and toils? In the last two numbers of the Jeffersonian, we stated some of our recollections forty-five years ago, and propose to give others; but what we are able to give will only be a drop in the bucket to the wells from which others might draw for the public good. In our last number we spoke of the lawyers who practised in the courts of this county in 1828. We omitted the name of James W. Saunders who, in later years, and until his death, was clerk of the District Court of Appeals. Jno. B. Spiece was also a practising lawyer in 1828, and he is the only survivor of all the lawyers belonging to the Albemarle Bar of that day. The old Swan Tavern, that we spoke of, in its latter days was called the old War Office, and for a time was used for Thespian entertainments; Judge E. R. Watson, we believe, was a member of that Thespian Club. In the summer of 1832, the old Swan tumbled down, or was pulled down. At the time of its fall, there was a ball at the Eagle Hotel; the noise of the crash startled the belles and beaux, and caused them to think it the rumbling of an earthquake—it was only the exit of the old Swan, singing its dying notes. On the east side of the Public Square, stands the brick building known as No. Nothing;1 1. Still standing, 240-242 Court Square. This lot was bought, June 15, 1820, by Opie Norris and John C. Ragland, from Edmund Anderson of Richmond, Albemarle County Deed Book 22, p. 334. There were at that time no improvements thereon, and a memorandum states that the ground between it and the Swan Tavern was to remain a public street or road, and not to be stopped up without the consent of both parties. In 1823, Dr. Ragland having died, Mr. Norris purchased his rights. It is supposed that the present building was then standing. Strangely enough, its northern and southern halves have continued to be separately owned. The origin of its name seems to be as follows: On the plat of 1818 (Albemarle County Surveyor's Book, Vol. 2, p. 147), the lots surrounding the Square are numbered and the open space between the Swan and Eagle taverns is distinctly marked with a cipher. Two years later, when this lot was sold from this space, it had no numeral and none in sequence could be allotted, so that the "nothing" or nought was used. In confirmation, we find on the 1818 plat that this lot, bought in 1820, has been sketched in with a different ink and the owners' names attached—the only lot so treated—which shows that it was not considered subject to sale when the map was originally drawn. At some later period, traditions of the slave trade gathered about this house. Some hold that the lot to the rear was used for this purpose. Mr. Homan W. Walsh, whose offices—formerly those of Mr. Dan Harmon—occupy the southern half, informs us: "I have, of course, heard that the building was used as a slave auction room. . . . I have never heard of a sign on the wall, relating to its use as a slave market. When I commenced practicing law in Mr. Harmon's office in 1906 and for several years afterwards there was at the side of the office at the curb a large stone, perhaps 18 inches high by 15 inches wide and 30 inches long, which it was said was the auction block for selling slaves. . . . It was taken away years ago by some employees of the city, when cleaning the streets or paving this section. . . . When we improved this building in 1925 we made no change in the exterior of the original building but merely tore down a cheaply built extension which had apparently in recent years been added at the rear." To this he adds that since writing, a southern snow brought out for an hour some black lettering through the paint on the southern side of his office, facing the Monticello Hotel, as follows: "—BENSON AND BRO. AUCTION ROOMS." As the Bensons were for years the town auctioneers, and this sign was just over the auction block, we may infer that all auctions were conducted here, and thus when slaves were brought in, their dealers made use of these facilities. in it the late Samuel Leitch, Jr., (usually called Young Sam), and Col. John R. Jones, carried on mercantile business. Mr. L. was by birth an Irishman, and came to Charlottesville about the year 1819, and became clerk to his brother, James Leitch, a merchant who did quite a large business in the store-house next to No. Nothing, and accumulated a large estate. Young Mr. Leitch was sociable, friendly, hospitable and enthusiastic in whatever he engaged in. In after years he built, and carried on business in, the house which stands where the Swan did. He served a number of years as alderman in Charlottesville, and died four years since, aged 79. Col. John R. Jones occupied the southern half of No. Nothing; he had previously been a co-partner and associated in business with Col. Bramham; he was, we think, also interested in a mercantile firm at Louisa Court House. He did quite an extensive business here, and acted as the financial agent of several of the most substantial planters and farmers of the county. About that time he erected the fine mansion on Jefferson st., now owned and occupied by John H. Bibb, Esq.2 2. 109 East Jefferson Street, facing Lee Park. John H. was nephew to William A. Bibb, mentioned above. A Louisa County family. When the Farmers Bank was established in this place, he became its President. Col. Jones reared a large family of ten children, and all lived to be men and women; one of his sons, John M. Jones, received his education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and rose to be a General in the Confederate Army; he lost his life while rallying his troops at the great battle of Chancellorsville, and was interred in the cemetery here in 1864. Col. Jones was a hospitable man, and entertained hosts of friends and relations, at his sumptuous board. For years before his death he was a member of the Baptist church and died in its communion. In front of No. Nothing, on court-day, could often be witnessed a scene worthy of beholding. Three of Virginia's patriotic and noble sons, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe, had frequently, in former years been seen standing together conversing. All three of these worthies had filled the highest post of honor within the gift of the free people of the Union. Each honored, respected and confided in the other. It may not be improper to state a fact here that is not generally known. When Mr. Madison was a candidate for the Presidency, the Federalists had used the name of his personal friend, James Monroe, against him, which, for a time, caused a coolness on the part of the Republicans towards the latter. Mr. Jefferson, who knew Mr. Monroe well, and placed a high estimate of his worth and statesmanship, was exceedingly anxious to have him again restored in the affections of the then dominant party. For this purpose, on election day, in April, 1810, he came to town, and insisted upon Mr. Monroe's becoming a candidate for the House of Delegates for this county. He succeeded in inducing some of those who had announced themselves candidates to withdraw; Mr. Monroe then went upon the hustings and was elected. At that time the Court House was the only voting place in the county, and freeholders alone were entitled to vote. The democrats in the legislature knowing that Mr. Monroe had the confidence of Mr. Jefferson, and came endorsed by the great county of Albemarle, elected him Governor of the State. The Governor was then elected annually by the legislature but could be elected for three years in succession. In 1812 Mr. Madison appointed Mr. Monroe his Secretary of State, and afterwards Secretary of War. The taking of an office with a smaller salary, in order to aid the government in those trying times of war, and his efficiency in the discharge of his duties, rendered Mr. Monroe very popular with the people. In 1816 he was elected President of the United States to succeed his friend and neighbor, Mr. Madison. John Adams, the second President of the United States, voted for Mr. Monroe in the electoral college of Massachusetts. The brick building next to No. Nothing was [adjoined by?] a small wooden building where the Charlottesville Library3 3. Founded by Charles Harper of Spring Hill, near Ivy, and Valentine W. Southall, whose home occupied the block now the site of Lee Park. In later years his daughter, Mrs. Col. Charles S. Venable, resided there, and the chief kindergarten of the community was conducted in an office in the yard by Miss Charlie Petrie, sister of Dr. George L. Petrie, pastor for fifty years (18781928) of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church. was kept, which, for many years was a source of great benefit to the citizens. Mr. Jefferson aided this library, and his extensive acquaintances with eminent persons, enabled him to procure valuable works for it. Rev. Andrew Eliot, an eminent congregational minister in Boston, Massachusetts, contributed works to this library. What remains of this old library, we think is in the possession of the Young Men's Christian Association of Charlottesville. The late Andrew Leitch was a merchant, and did business in the brick building4 4. That is, next towards the north—the building previously mentioned as next to No. Nothing. It still stands, 223 Court Square. This lot, without building, was bought in 1815 from Edmund Anderson (Albemarle County Deed Book 19, p. 410), by James Leitch, who in 1825 made gift of it to his son Andrew, being "the lot on which my storehouse now stands", ibid., Book 56, p. 381. The quiet little Sixth Street upon which it faces is described as "the main road leading from Charlottesville to Moore's ford." next to the old library building, now the office of Wm. T. Early, Register in bankruptcy. Next to this [library] building stood two wooden tenements; the first was occupied by Lewis Leschot,5 5. The home of E. L. Bailey, 222 Court Square, covers the sites of the Library and Leschot's shop. This brick building was erected by Richard Matthews, who bought the lot in 1836 from Andrew Leitch (ibid., Book 33, p. 395). At that time the property was listed as in the county, "adjoining the East line of the Town." In 1879 it was purchased from the Matthews heirs by Thomas Wood (ibid., Book 74, p. 515). a watchmaker and jeweler, from Switzerland, who had settled here by the advice of Mr. Jefferson and was quite extensively patronized by the people far and wide. Sophia Leschot afterwards carried on the dry goods business; she had a fine taste and pleased the ladies in her selections. In after years she was a partner of the firm of B. C. Flannagan &amp; Company in the large Warehouse on Main street, next to I. Leterman, in which for many years an extensive dry goods business was conducted, until Mr. B. C. Flannagan entered into the business of banking. Mr. Richard Matthews, was the successor to Mr. Lewis Leschot, and till his decease, conducted the business of a watchmaker and jeweler; he had watches manufactured in Geneva for his sales here. In the next building to Mr. Leschot, where the law office of Judge W. J. Robertson6 6. Judge William J. Robertson was a distinguished jurist, having been elected in 1859 to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia by popular election over John B. Baldwin. He was attorney for the State in a number of cases, one being the famous suit affecting the Arlington property, belonging to the Lee family and confiscated by the United States. He was the first president of the Virginia Bar Association. Died, 1898. Tyler, Encyc. of Va. Biography, Vol. II, p. 67. now is, stood a plain, one and a half story wooden tenement7 7. Now the site of the law office of Long and Sadler, 218-220 Court House Square. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 358, states that Yeargain was a citizen of Charlottesville in 1796, in which year he took out a license for an ordinary. In Albemarle County Deed Book 14, p. 213, is recorded his purchase in 1803 from Thomas W. Lewis and John T. Hawkins, for $1,000 cash, of "the lot, messuage and tenement" on the east side of the Square which became his home until his death in 1837. Reference is made to "old" and "new" parts of the dwelling, and at that time it was bounded on the south by another tenement (small house or cottage). and in it lived, and sold liquors, the hermit and miser John Yeargain. He came to Charlottesville in 1811, and carried on the business of saddle maker in the house now occupied by Mr. Wm. T. Early as a law office. He is said to have been a very sociable, genteel and agreeable man, fond of ladies company, and attended all the balls given in the place, ladies of rank, fashion and of the best of families becoming partners in the dance with him. On one occasion while at a ball some lady pinned the skirts of his coat up, and in the next set he cut a somewhat ridiculous figure, that caused a titter among the assembled party. This so mortified his feelings, that he never afterwards went to a party or ball. How long he conducted his saddle making business we do not know; he engaged in the purchase and sale of liquors and the Yeargain whiskey had a reputation that brought him extensive custom. At first his doors, like other stores, were open, and he stood behind his counter to wait on his customers but a party of young gentlemen, who had been to a wine party, entered his store to get drinks and one of them jumped over the counter and aided the old man to make change. From that date he closed his store doors, and put a ball and chain to the upper half of it, and when any person wanted anything he would open his door only a few inches. He left his house once a year to go to the Court House to obtain his license, and to make a few purchases of necessary articles of food. He would, occasionally, admit a few personal friends into his home, but he was a recluse for many years, and to the end of his life. He wore short buckskin breeches, drab colored cloth swallow-tail coat, and a knit cap on his head. On a few occasions we have seen him stand with the upper half of his store door open, conversing with a crowd drawn together by the novelty of the sight. It was known that he hoarded and buried his money. He never received anything but silver coin. He died suddenly, some 35 years since.—It is believed that in a fit of apoplexy he fell into the fireplace, where he was found dead with a slight bruise on his forehead. In his cellar under his fire wood, was found his buried treasure, amounting to six thousand dollars, which we saw placed in tubs in the public room at the Eagle hotel. Many persons believed that he had secreted a much larger amount of money than was found in his cellar. A large excavation was seen in the stalls of the adjoining stable, from which it was said, at the time, some of Yeargain's treasures had been buried, and taken away at the time of his death. A plaster bust was taken of Mr. Yeargain after his death, and the late John Toole, artist, painted a striking likeness of him, which is now in the possession of Col. Th: J. Randolph. Some years ere his death, a nephew of his visited him; and the old man boarded him at the Eagle hotel, and at the end of a week told him he must stay no longer. Mr. Yeargain had a sister living in Elizabeth city, and other relatives who inherited his property. January 14, 1874 On the southside of the Public Square, where the Farish Hotel1 1. This site is now occupied by the east wing of the Monticello Hotel, Court Square. It is marked on the early survey as Lot I, and was bought, Oct. 1765, by Benjamin Brown and David Ross, from Thomas Walker, Commissioner for the town of Charlottesville (Albemarle County Deed Book 4, p. 205). When Ross sold to Isaac Miller, 1791, the tavern is mentioned, and from that time to the present it has been the site of a place of public entertainment. There have been many changes of ownership: John T. Hawkins bought, 1801; John M. Sheppard, 1804; Thomas Welles, 1813; William D. Fitch, 1833; John T. Barksdale, 1842; Nelson Barksdale, 1847; George W. Turpin, 1849; George L. Peyton, 1849. When William T. Early and William P. Farish bought in 1863 the name was still Eagle Tavern, but in 1869, when they sold to N. H. Massie (ibid., Book 63, p. 485), the description reads "formerly called the Eagle Tavern, but now known as the Farish House." William P. Farish came to the county from Carolina about 1820. He was an active man of affairs, and later became a Baptist minister. During Sheridan's raid, Captain Thomas L. Farish, his son, underwent the following harrowing experience: he was at that time acting as Adjutant-General of General H. H. Walker's command in southside Virginia. Learning that the Federal troops were approaching Albemarle, he obtained a three-days' leave of absence in order to return and protect his family. An engine brought him to Colonel Randolph's at Shadwell (Edgehill). Here he found that the Colonel was in hiding in the mountains, so leaving a note detailing his plans, to be carried by a colored boy who regularly transmitted food, he crossed the river to Milton. Here he concealed his uniform by hanging it down an old well, and, donning a shabby work-suit provided by his friend Mr. Benjamin Pace, he pushed on across Monticello Mountain. Unfortunately, the boy was captured by scouts and the note taken. For some reason it was believed to be from General Early, and Sheridan sent bloodhounds to aid the hunt. The Captain was at length found on the town side of the mountain, hidden between two fallen trees. He was taken to the headquarters of a Colonel Wells, which chanced to be at Belmont, near Verdant Lawn, the home of the prisoner's father. Here he was of course recognized, but the Federals suspecting a ruse, and still thinking him to be Early, he was taken quickly to the headquarters of General Custer. This proved to be his own home, The Farm, now the residence of Mrs. George R. B. Michie. From the roof of this mansion "signal flags were floating in all directions." Here a small daughter cried out, "Oh, Mamma, they've got Papa!" and this established his identity. General Custer showed much concern and compassion. Receiving him he said, "Captain Farish, under these unusual circumstances I don't know whether it is my duty to ask you to take a seat or yours to ask me." He granted him time to change his dress, and then entered upon efforts for the prisoner's protection, but as Captain Farish was in civilian dress Sheridan ordered him hanged as a spy, and workmen hastily constructed a scaffold beneath one of the giant white oaks upon the lawn. Custer made repeated and persistent remonstrances and at length, at twilight, persuaded Sheridan to hear the condemned man in his own behalf. This commanding officer had headquarters on Park Street, "in a residence which in 1876 was occupied by S. V. Southall" (Miss Betsy Coles' home, now the Haden place, 522 Park Street. This clashes with the claims of the John R. Wood place, 408 Park Street, and of the Mrs. Julia Coles place —now the Valentine home—303 High Street, to have served as Sheridan's headquarters). The discussion lasted until midnight, and a General Forsythe "so far exceeded his duties as a soldier and the courtesies of a gentleman" that he was freely condemned by others of the staff. The verdict was at length changed to parole. (Captain T. L. Farish's own narrative in the Weekly Chronicle, Charlottesville, Aug. 4, 1876, copy in Alderman Library, University of Va.) Tradition states that Custer's command entered town displaying captured Confederate flags, and the unpublished Memoirs of the late Judge R. T. W. Duke confirm the local tradition that during this raid the Woolen Mills and the railroad bridge across the Rivanna were burned by Federal troops. is located, once stood a two-and-a-halfstory wooden building, then known as the Eagle Hotel. A verandah, or porch, extended along the whole front of this building, which, on court-days, was used for the sale of dry goods, saddles, boots, shoes, &amp;c., by traveling pedlars. On Saturday and Sunday evenings, the boys of half a century since resorted to the river to have a little fun, in seeing the pedlars cross over with their vehicles, laden with dry goods, tin ware and notions. Pedlars in that day, to a considerable extent, supplied the country with many necessary articles, and some of these pedlars, in after years, settled and became a part of the people, owning lands, slaves, &amp;c. We recollect some of these pedlars coming here down to 1835-36. The proprietor of the hotel was Mr. William D. Fitch; in 1833 he was succeeded by Mr. John Vowles. The price of board, room and lodging was then but $10 per month, and travelers paid $1.25 for a day's entertainment and horse feed, which was the usual price throughout the State. For 62½ cents a traveller, at country taverns and houses of private entertainment, could have supper, lodging, breakfast and horse feed, and usually the decanter with whiskey and other ardent spirits was set before the guest on his arrival at night and ere he commenced his journey next day. The public room of the Eagle Hotel was a spacious hall, having in it a large open fireplace, which, in winter time, sent forth a blazing and roaring hot fire. In one corner of this public room was situated the bar, having shelves on which were ranged in order, decanters and bottles of the ardent—elixir of life. The front of the bar was composed of a kind of lattice-work, which opened on hinges like a window, and when opened was fastened up to the ceiling. In those days, imbibers of the ardent took their drams publicly, the refinements of the present day of exclusiveness and darkened windows not having come into use. In after years, when G. L. Peyton was proprietor of this hotel, two hundred persons or more dined there on court-days, and in the stable and lot 250 horses were fed and cared for—that was before railroads came into vogue, and when our farmers sat down to a superb dinner, and cheerfully paid the landlord fifty cents for it— not as in the present times, when many bring snacks in their pockets and eat them while sitting at a fire kept up by the landlord for the guests of the hotel. In 1828, the time occupied in reaching this place in the stage coaches from Richmond was about 28 hours. Porter, Belden &amp; Co. we think, were the mail contractors, and they made only three trips per week. In Charlottesville the stopping place was then the Stone Tavern,2 2. See post, p. 53, n. 12. kept by Joel W. Brown. In after years the late John N. C. Stockton had their coaches stop at the Eagle Hotel and when the Monticello Hotel was built, adjoining the Stone Tavern, that was headquarters for the stage coaches. In the summer, when the travel to the Virginia springs was at its height, eight or ten coaches per day, filled with passengers, stopped here to dinner. The proprietors of this hotel were Messrs. Hill &amp; Terrell who came here from Orange county. Farish, Ficklin &amp; Co. were the mail contractors. Landlords, in those days, took in and dispensed a large amount of hard money, and our young friend, S. W. F.,3 3. Slaughter W. Ficklin. was in his glory and at the commencement of his full tide of prosperity. Passengers were each allowed 50 pounds of baggage; all over was extra and had to be paid for; scales then decided the weight. Next to the Eagle Hotel was a handsome block of buildings, erected about 1826, by the late John Winn, who owned and resided at Belmont,4 4. This prosperous farm has become Charlottesville's southern suburb. The transformed old house is at 759 Belmont Avenue. It was originally the home of John M. Carr, nephew of Dabney Carr, the boyhood friend of Jefferson. John M. Carr was Clerk of the District Court of Charlottesville and first Clerk of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County. He died in 1823. Belmont was later the home of Slaughter W. Ficklin, who died in 1886. now the property of Mr. S. W. Ficklin. Mr. Winn was the postmaster, and for many years a successful merchant. He had been a co-partner with Twyman Wayt, with Hardin Davis, who was postmaster when Th. Jefferson became President of the United States, and also with John W. Davis, the son of Hardin Davis; the latter gentleman resided in the house now owned and occupied by John T. Antrim,5 5. This old place was on West High Street, opposite Christ Church, set far back in a sloping lawn with apple trees. In 1836 it was purchased from J. W. Davis by Gov. Thomas Walker Gilmer and was his home until his death in 1844. Later, it was for many years the home of Mr. John T. Antrim, Sr. It is now the site of the Altamont Development. and emigrated, after 1825, to Missouri, where he died. The post office was kept in a room now occupied by Drury Wood as a law office. The next store was occupied by Mr. Marshall, who made boots and shoes, and sold books and fancy articles. Afterwards drugs, medicines, &amp;c., were sold here for many years. Dr. J. T. Barclay, who purchased Monticello, and afterwards went to Jerusalem as a Missionary, and wrote an interesting volume about that city, entitled, "The City of the Great King; or Jerusalem as it was, as it is, and as it is to be," was engaged in the drug business here for a few years. Dr. Barclay was succeeded by Field &amp; Goss, George M. McIntire, Wm. A. Watson and Wm. Poindexter. This store is now vacant. All the other parts of this building except the upper room in the western and southern end of it (which was the lodge room of the Widow's Son Lodge of Masons) were used for a hotel, and known as the Jefferson Hotel. The proprietor was a Mr. Garrett, the Chronicle building was also then occupied as a part of this hotel. At the present day all but the store-rooms6 6. One of these was later a prosperous grocery run by a Negro named Edmunds and much patronized by the neighboring lawyers. in the Winn block are attached to the Farish House, of which Mr. A. D. Almond is proprietor. The store-room on the corner of Court [Fifth] street, now occupied by Allen Bacon, was once occupied by Mr. Henry Price, merchant tailor, who afterwards, and till the day of his death, in 1835, conducted his business in the vicinity of the University. Mr. Price7 7. Price came to Charlottesville about 1823 and lived in the white frame house, later the home of J. J. Conner, which long stood on the corner of 4th and High (312 East High Street), but which has been moved a short distance and is now the home of the Misses Wright, 409 4th Street, N. E. Now modernized, it is one of our oldest buildings. Dr. Thomas Jameson lived here in 1806 and sold in 1815 to John Kelly. High Street in one of these deeds is called "the upper street leading out to Jameson's Gap". The building shows the good workmanship of the period, and the use of wooden pins for nails. was by birth an Englishman, a sociable, intelligent and whole-souled man; he had been in the English army, and served in the memorable battle of Waterloo, and would often recite graphic and interesting descriptions of that great battle, which dethroned and made Napoleon a prisoner to the end of his days. Mr. Price was sometimes absent-minded. It is related of him that once, in making out an account, and previous to signing his name to it, he hesitated, passing his fingers several times through the hair on his head, and then, rushing out of his store, looked up to his sign, saying: "Ah, yes! Henry Price! Henry Price!" and returned into his store and put his name to the account before him. On the opposite corner of Court street, where John Mannoni,8 8. Now the site of the Court Square Building, Corner East Jefferson and 5th Streets. confectioner, now keeps, was the dry goods store of Col. J. Richard Watson. Mr. Watson in after years, was a magistrate, and removed his place of business to the corner of the lot on which the Piedmont Female Institute9 9. Post, see p. 48, n. 4. now is. He afterwards became a tiller of the soil and resided on his farm near Milton. He was as pleasant and agreeable a gentleman as ever Albemarle produced. His house and table were the dispensers of his unbounded hospitality. He died since the war. His only son lost his life in the late war for Independence. The next store was occupied by Mr. John Cochran,10 10. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 168, states that John Cochran came to Charlottesville from Augusta County about 1825. The early history of this residence, 414 East Jefferson Street, is not certain, but as the lot was a part of the John Kelly square, as lots three and four of the early survey were known, and the lot with the brick dwelling on it was sold by Mr. Kelly's heirs in 1879, it is supposed that Kelly built the property and rented to Cochran. The building date could not be ascertained. The place was purchased, 1879, by William T. Jones from Mrs. Eliza Bragg (Albemarle County Deed Book 82, p. 469), and sold by Jones in 1893 to Mrs. Richard Knight Flannagan (Charlottesville Corporation Court, Deed Book 3, p. 480). It remained the home of this family for about twenty-six years. who is the only survivor of the business men in this place when the Local first knew it. He did a large mercantile business for twenty years. He imported from England the gray cloths which the students of the University wore when a gray uniform was the prescribed dress of that institution. His residence, up to 1846, was in the brick building west of his store. In 1846 he built the large and beautiful mansion on Park street, in which he now resides. These stores were erected in 1826 by the late John Kelly and their first occupants were Col. Watson and Mr. Cochran. On the place previous to that time a large wooden building stood, which was removed to the lower end of the lot opposite to the old Stone Tavern, on Market street, and which still remains there. Mr. John Kelly, previous to the year 1826 was engaged in the mercantile business, and amassed a fitting competence. He was a man of sterling integrity and a decided christian gentleman. He was a Presbyterian, and the chief contributor to the erection of the Presbyterian church, which was first opened for worship in this town in the summer of 1829. In person, he was tall and graceful, and one of the neatest men in dress and appearance of his day. Regular and systematic in all things, he never waited even for his guests beyond the regular hour for meals or prayer. He was sociable, friendly and charitable, and was fond of having the young people of the place at his hospitable and bountiful board. He died, we think, at the White Sulphur Springs in August, 1830. Opie Norris, Esq., the son-in-law of John Kelly, had also been a merchant, and resided in the house on the Square11 11. Still standing, 410 East Jefferson Street. Mr. Norris built this house, having received the half-acre lot—No. 4—in gift from his father-in-law John Kelly, Feb. 1816 (Albemarle County Deed Book 20, p. 85). The land deed traces back through Edward Butler to Samuel Woods, 1779. It remained the home of Norris until his death in 1839, and of his widow until hers in 1868. His obituary states that he was the tallest and thinnest man in Charlottesville. He was for years a Town Trustee, frequently serving as President, and through his ownership of the present Rugby Road section be became a county magistrate. In 1806 (ibid., Book 15, p. 465), we find Opie Norris and Cynthia his wife manumitting a female slave named Joyce. Between the Cochran and Norris homes there was later built a brick building which made use of their side walls on either end. It was erected on Norris land and sold in 1874 by the Norris estate to B. L. Powell (ibid., Book 69, p. 217). See this deed for the plat of these buildings which marks the recently sold Norris home, No. 410, with the name of Dr. R. W. Nelson. The intermediate house, No. 412, is now known as the E. O. McCue, Jr. Building. recently purchased from his estate by Dr. R. W. Nelson.12 12. Dr. Robert W. Nelson of the Belvoir family lived here in the 1870's, having succeeded in practice his relative, Dr. Robert Burrell Nelson. He was successively followed in practice by his son, Dr. Hugh T. Nelson, and by Dr. Hugh T., Jr. Later, Dr. Robert W. Nelson for a while lived at 205 East High Street, where the other three also lived and had their offices, and which is still in possession of the family, making four generations of physicians of this name in that dwelling. He was a man of mark, an upright magistrate, a citizen of sterling worth, and as useful and beneficial to this community as any man that ever lived here. In his late years, he was an invalid and greatly troubled with the gout. Between the above houses and the one now occupied by Lewellen Wood, Mrs. Sophia Leschot, built a twostory brick house, and for several years carried on the mercantile dry goods business. The Square till about 1840 was the principal business mart, but from that time the old merchants one by one removed to the Main street, which has since grown up and extended its whole length with stores and other places of business. On court days the Square is now usually thronged with crowds of people, and since the war large crowds are also to be seen on Main Street, congregated in front of the National Bank. January 28, 1874 Park Street—This street, in 1828-9, had but few dwellings compared with what can be seen on it at the present day. On the right, or eastern side, stood the old Swan Tavern, and where the Town Hall1 1. Now the Park View Apartment, 350 Park Street. On July 9, 1851, a committee consisting of Valentine W. Southall, John Cochran, Thos. Wood, S. W. Ficklin, James W. Saunders, John R. Jones and others bought this lot from Samuel Leitch, Jr., and Isabella his wife "for the purpose of building a town hall." Albemarle County Deed Book 50, p. 143. It was long used for public occasions of all kinds. Later, it was purchased by J. M. Levy of Monticello and became known as the Levy Opera House. now is was the battery. The next lot where the beautiful mansion of John Wood, Jr.,2 2. 408 Park St. This is one of the three houses in which varying traditions place Sheridan's headquarters during the raid of March 3-6, 1865. According to the memories of this family, during Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's residence here the ladies of the household remained in seclusion on the second floor, and Mr. Snowden Wood of Ivy in later life often related how—he having been a small boy in the family at that time—his pony was taken by the soldiers, but his lamentations reaching the General's ears, its return was promptly ordered. Mrs. Julia Coles's home, now the Valentine house on High Street, and Miss Betsy Coles's place on Park Street are the other two claimants. The last is based on an article in The Weekly Chronicle, Aug. 4, 1876 (eleven years after the event), which says: "the commanding officer of the Federal troops had his headquarters on Park Street in a residence which in 1876 was occupied by S. V. Southall." This confusion probably arises from the fact that Sheridan's staff officers were also quartered in the town, including General Wesley Merritt, Colonel James W. Forsythe, and, according to the unpublished diary of the late John B. Minor of the University of Virginia, a Captain Sheridan, nephew to the general. now stands, was a vacant lot; next to it, the small one-story brick tenement was occupied by Mrs. Milly Jones, a widow lady, and sister to William Watson, where, on Saturday evenings, prayer-meetings were usually holden, conducted by Mr. John Kelly and others. Next house, brick, is the property of Mrs. James W. Saunders,3 3. Still standing at 416 Part Street. Mr. Saunders was the father of a family of handsome daughters. It was his habit in the evening, at a fixed hour, to place his open watch on a silver tray and send it into the parlor by the butler, to be presented to each gentleman in turn. was at one time occupied by the Rev. Francis Bowman, then pastor of the Presbyterian church at South Plains and this town. He afterwards removed to Georgia, and now in his old age resides with his son in Harrisonburg, who is the pastor of the Presbyterian church in that town. His other son, pastor of the Presbyterian church in Memphis, fell a victim to the pestilence that raged in that city last summer. The wife and children of this latter minister returned to this place last week to reside with her adopted parents, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Wood. The large mansion next to Mrs. Saunders was erected by the late John Kelly, Esq.,4 4. 506 Park Street. Later, this was long the residence of the Misses Howard, daughters of Dr. Henry Howard of the University faculty, they having conducted here a successful school for girls. who resided on it from the time he quit business on the Square till his death in 1830. The house is now in the occupancy of Mrs. Moise. The next residence is now owned by Drury Wood, Esq.5 5. 516 Park Street. This was one of the lots laid out in 1813 by Edmund Anderson and known as the Anderson Addition. In 1819 (Deed Book 22, p. 56), Edmund Anderson deeded it to — Pollock, who, a little later (Book 26, p. 227) sold to J. A. Leitch and John Timberlake. These, in 1849, deeded it to Drury Wood and — Carr (Book 47, p. 455). The history of the original house which was on this lot, and in which Mr. Wood lived, cannot be traced, but Woods, Albemarle County, p. 207, states that Governor Gilmer lived here in 1826, and that Francis B. Dyer occupied it prior to his death in 1838. Mr. Wood, son of Drury Wood the elder of "Park Hill" near Stony Point, died in 1901. In the same year his son, the late Mr. James B. Wood, built the present brick dwelling, now the home of a member of the third generation of this family. Tradition states that at the time of Tarleton's raid a contingent of his troops were camped in the fields north of High Street, from about 4th Street, N. E., to Park Street and as far north as this place, relics having been uncovered in this vicinity. An anecdote of the Yankee looting of this old place also survives. Having broken open a meat house and taken what they wanted, the soldiers then engaged in a mock battle with the remaining stores of meal and peas. A small son of the household, outraged by this destruction of sorely-needed food, at length approached the group and said firmly, "You fellows better mind out. If my mother catches you, you'll be sorry!" These were all the houses that were erected at that time on the east side of Park street. The residences of S. V. Southall,6 6. 522 Park Street, now the home of Dr. W. Dan Haden. Tradition states that this site was the original "hanging lot", and the late Mr. Lyt Macon of Tufton related that as a child he was brought to town by someone—probably a servant—to witness an execution here. The house was built by Miss Betsy Coles of Enniscorthy, who bought the lot March 4, 1844 (Albemarle County Deed Book 41, p. 442). Her death occurred in May, 1865, (see Will Book 27, p. 350) and was caused by alarm and agitation over Sheridan's raid. (See note 1, pp. 26-28, for Sheridan in connection with this house.) The property was purchased from her estate by Mr. Southall, June 2, 1875 (see Deed Book 69, p. 614), he having been a tenant since about 1869. S. F. Leake,7 7. 532 Park Street. Woods, Albemarle County, pp. 249-50, tells us: "The career of Shelton F. Leake is well known, not only in the county, but in the State. His natural gifts were unusually brilliant. He . . . was admitted to the bar in 1838, easily attained a place in its front rank, was a member of the House of Delegates, was Lieutenant Governor of the State, and for a term [1845-47] represented the district in Congress." He died in 1884. Henry Benson,8 8. 544 Park Street. The home of the late Mr. William J. Rucker is upon this site. Allen Dawson, early educator, in his later years moved his Boys' School from Main Street to a building on this lot. C. S. Waltham,9 9. This possibly refers to the dwelling between the Benson and Flannagan houses, 554 Park Street, now known as the Hanckel place. The old part of this house was built about 1840-45, probably by John H. Timberlake. It changed hands frequently, and was rented for a time by the late Mason Gordon. The north wing was added by Louis T. Hanckel, who bought the property from Geo. R. Crigler of Orange County, May 11, 1876, being already its occupant. Mr. Hanckel was the son of Dr. James Stuart Hanckel of Charleston, S. C., who in 1868 was called to the rectorship of Christ Church in Charlottesville, where he served for twenty-four years—until death—being an outstanding member of the community. Mr. L. T. Hanckel was a lawyer, a bank president and a successful business man. As mayor, he was responsible for the introduction of our modern sewerage system. This residence is still the home of descendants. Bruce, History of Virginia, Vol. IV, pp. 58, 59. B. C. Flannagan,10 10. 598 Park Street, now the home of Mr. A. G. Carter. It is believed that the house was built by John H. Timberlake for his aunt, Mrs. B. C. Flannagan. This property, consisting of 32 acres, was bought in 1901 from the Trustees of Mrs. M. M. and Mrs. M. S. Durrette by the late Judge Thomas Barton Lyons of Birmingham, Ala. (Albemarle County Deed Book 94, p. 459). Its grounds have been converted into building sites and Lyons Avenue commemorates this family's association with the estate. Jno. Wood, Jr., and R. K. Flannagan, have been erected in later years. On the west side of Park street was the brick house of William Watson11 11. 415 Park Street. the jailor, now the property of Thomas Wood, Esq., and on the corner of the lot where the mansion of John Cochran now is, stood a one-a-half wooden tenement where the widow and family of Dr. Ragland resided. Mrs. Ragland was the daughter of Mr. John Kelly, and afterwards married Mr. T. Bragg, a merchant, who removed to Missouri, where Mrs. Bragg now resides. There also stood a small wooden tenement and wagon shop occupied by John A. Williams on the lot where Mrs. Gen. Long has a female seminary; and from there to Rock Hill,12 12. Rugby Avenue. Now the home of Dr. H. A. Porter. It was bought from Meriwether Anderson by James Fife in 1839, and has changed hands a number of times since, having been more recently the home of Major Eugene Bradbury. the residence of W. W. Flannagan, there were no other dwellings. The house next to Th. Wood, with the Mansard roof,13 13. Still standing at 427 Park Street. This was the home of Robert Poore. In the 'fifties Miss Lizzie Poore conducted here a successful school for small children, music being a feature of the curriculum and the pupils numbering about twenty. It was later the home of Miss Virginia Carrington, who, following a visit to France at the close of the War between the States, erected the Mansard roof, then a novelty in this section. Still later, this was long the home of the Misses Ross. John Cochran's mansion,14 14. The Cochran house has been pulled down. It was a large brick dwelling with a noted box walk, and was built by John Cochran of Augusta County, who bought the lot in 1829 but built in 1846. It remained his home until his death in 1883. The site covered several of our modern lots and the house stood about at 563 Park Street, now the home of Mr. Robert A. Watson. the female seminary of Mrs. Gen. Long,15 15. "Northwood", now 551 Park Street. This old house was built by Mr. John B. Minor, prior to his appointment to the Professorship of Law at the University in 1845. The Geo. E. McIntires were living here in 1848, while their High Street home was building. Then Mrs. Julia Minor Holladay of Spotsylvania County bought it and made it her home until about 1869. She sold the north part of her lawn for the Robertson lawn, and the Sinclair place, 547 Park Street, was built in her flower garden. Mr. Dabney C. Davis lived here a short while, preceding Mrs. Long. Of Mrs. Long's "Northwood School", Miss C. E. Wills, now of Fairfield, Penn., writes: "It had become quite well established by the 1870's. Several small boys were pupils—Mrs. Long's sons, Sumner and Mac, Dallas Flannagan and Muscoe Shackelford. The Misses Lucy and Annie Shackelford were among the young lady pupils, Stella and Leta Reierson and Lottie Benson among the smaller girls. The French teacher was Mademoiselle Cataldi." In 1884 Mrs. Holladay sold "Northwood" to Mrs. Charles P. Benson (Albemarle County Deed Book 83, p. 414). It was later long the home of Mr. William H. Wood, whose family remain the owners. the residences of Judge Wm. J. Robertson,16 16. 595 Park Street. This home was long a landmark in the social life of the state. The great oaks upon the lawn were lost in the drought of 1930, and the house has been modernized. Judge E. R. Watson,17 17. Now the Christ Church rectory, 599 Park Street. Built by Judge Egbert R. Watson about 1856, and the family's home until his death in 1887. During the occupancy of the town by Union troops a northern colonel and his orderly were quartered here. Both conducted themselves with much consideration, and the officer, at Judge Watson's request, stationed guards at a number of houses occupied by unprotected women. A handsome Newfoundland dog, which had been the Colonel's companion throughout the war, strayed back to this home about a week after the troops had left. Judge Watson sent a letter through the lines to the Colonel telling of its whereabouts, and immediately after the surrender at Appomattox the orderly came for it. and Capt. Adair18 18. 1035 Park Street. Originally named "Meadlands". In 1847 Mr. Richard K. Meade, rector of Christ Church, bought the tract from John W. Davis of Missouri and made it his home (Albemarle County Deed Book 45, p. 193). He sold in 1868 to B. A. Shepherd of Texas (ibid., Book 63, p. 542), and he, in 1883, sold to Dr. Charles Hardenburg Hedges of Somerville, New Jersey. It remains the home of a son, Dr. Halstead Shipman Hedges. have been erected in later years. The residences on this street are built in good taste, and their situations are lovely and picturesque, and are well calculated for persons of means and leisure. Doubtless, in time to come, the lands attached to these dwellings will be divided and subdivided, to make room for other households. In the eastern part of Jefferson street, on the right side, is the large brick dwelling house19 19. 704 E. Jefferson Street. Captain Eugene Davis had lived here with his wife's widowed mother, Mrs. James Maury Morris of the Green Springs family, before building and removing to his home "Willoughby" on the old Lynchburg road. Later, this house was long the home of Major Horace Jones, who conducted one of the most successful preparatory schools of this region. erected by the late Francis B. Dyer, Esq., where Rice Wood, brother of Th. and Drury Wood, lived. In after years, Mr. Wm. D. Fitch kept a public house, where the Richmond and Staunton stage coaches put up. The property in late years was owned by Eugene Davis, Esq., who sold it to Mr. Young, a gentleman from Louisiana, who now occupies it. The next house was the residence of Dr. Charles Carter,20 20. 802 East Jefferson Street. Still standing. Built by Dr. Carter in 1820, the third story was added at a later date. Still the home of a descendant. who practiced medicine in this place for many years. Dr. Carter represented this county for several years in the House of Delegates. He was a gentleman of kind, generous and social qualities and highly respected by the entire community. He was a member of Widows Son Lodge, also of the Episcopal Church in this place. He was a lineal descendent of Col. Carter the Colonial Secretary under George the Second, King of Great Britain; he owned vast possessions in this part of Virginia. It was from Secretary Carter that the range of mountains trending south from Charlottesville derived their name. Secretary's Ford21 21. The ford used on the Three Notched Road, where Tarleton crossed, and where the Woolen Mills now stand. had the same derivation as well as the Secretary Road.22 22. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 68, tells us: "the Secretary's Road has frequent mention in the early records. It set out from Carter's Mill on the north fork of Hardware, shortly above its union with the south fork, ran on the north side of that river to Woodridge, and thence pursued the watershed between it and the Rivanna to Bremo on the James. From its lower terminus it was sometimes called the Bremo, corrupted to Brimmer, Road." It was a current opinion hereabouts that Secretary Ford and Secretary Road obtained their designations from Thomas Jefferson when he was Secretary of State, under the administration of President George Washington, but the records of the County Court of Albemarle will show an order of the court in 1745 which says the late "Secretary's Ford." The one-and-half story brick residence23 23. Now 901 East Jefferson-Street. Before the addition of the modern front it faced west, towards the Square. In later years it was known as the Morgan house. Further to the east stood the Albemarle Female Institute, a successful school founded by the Albemarle Baptist Association in 1857. It was purchased in 1860 by Professor John Hart, who conducted it until 1874. Under his control, the faculty was undenominational. In 1875 it became the property of Professors R. H. Rawlings and W. P. Dickinson; they conducted it at first jointly, then Mr. Dickinson directed it alone until his death. In 1895, Rev. L. H. Shuck of Wake Forest College and the University of North Carolina became the Principal. He was succeeded in 1897 by the Rev. H. W. Tribble with the title of President of Rawlings Institute, Mr. Rawlings having donated his three-fourths interest in the property to the Baptist denomination at that time. The school closed in 1909. Shortly afterwards, the property was bought by the Episcopal Church, and St. Anne's, a Church School for Girls, was opened there in 1910. This school has removed to the University suburbs. The old building, at present unused, is still standing at the junction of East Jefferson and Tenth Street. (Taken from "A History of Private Schools in Charlottesville," by Harold Mopsik, M.S. Thesis—University of Virginia, 1936.) next to the late Dr. Carter's mansion was probably erected by James Leitch a merchant with whom Th. Jefferson traded very largely. The late Gov. Thomas W. Gilmer once occupied this house in 1829-'30. The widow of James Leitch married David Anderson, Esq., and resided at Pantops. There is a large open space in front of the Leitch house, where for years past military parades have been held, and in late years the base-ballers have played their exhilarating games. The brick residences on the south-side of this open park, erected by Geo. M. McIntire,24 24. The handsome old McIntire house, built about 1848, was pulled down to make way for the Hughes Esso Filling Station, corner of E. High and 9th Streets. This is one of the houses which was thoroughly searched for food during the occupation of the town by northern troops in the spring of 1865, even a school girl's trunk being emptied. A superb black oak in the yard, long known as the McIntire Oak, has now become erroneously associated with Tarleton's raid. Micajah Woods25 25. 809 East High Street. Mr. Woods served for thirty-three years as Commonwealth's Attorney for the county. He was the son of Dr. John R. Woods of "Holkham", near Ivy, and a descendant of the original Michael. As captain of The Monticello Guard, he commanded that company at the Yorktown celebration, October, 1881. and C. D. Fishburne,26 26. 803 East High Street. Still the home of a descendant. Mr. C. D. Fishburne—"Old Clem" to his many friends—was born in Staunton, Va., but spent his childhood in Waynesboro. In early life he was for five years Professor of Latin at Davidson College. Having served with the Rockbridge Artillery during the War between the States, he later studied law at the University of Virginia, practiced for a short while, edited the Chronicle for a year, and then became cashier of the Albemarle Bank, a position which he held until his death in 1937. He was groomsman at the second marriage of Stonewall Jackson. A son of this household was the late John W. Fishburne, Judge of the Circuit Court for seventeen years and later member of Congress from this district. have been erected since 1830. February 11, 1874 Market Street.—The house1 1. Now the residence of Dr. W. D. Macon, 200 East 7th Street. Diagonally across from this house stands a frame cottage, 213 East 7th Street. This is one of the transplanted Milton houses, of which we have the following record: The lot, No. 9, was surveyed in Anderson's Addition, April 2, 1819 (Albemarle County Surveyor's Book 2, p. 149). In the same year Edmund Anderson purchased the lot from John Waymann. Anderson sold the lot, May 13, 1829, to Charles Everett (Deed Book 28, p. 312), and in 1848 Richard Matthews bought from Everett the "house and lot" at this location (Deed Book 48, p. 278). This shows that Everett put the house there. Dr. Everett had lived on High Street and practised his profession for a short while at the beginning of the century; he then removed to his county estate, Belmont, adjoining Edgehill near Milton. Persistent tradition has held that the house was brought from Milton, and Mr. J. S. Fitch, who a few years ago restored it, states that it had evidently undergone that experience, being built of re-used material such as is distinctive of those houses. It is now owned by Miss Therese Molyneaux. on the corner of Market and First [East 7th] streets, now the residence of A. R. Blakey, Esq., was, in 1828, occupied by the Rev. Frederick W. Hatch, rector of Christ church2 2. This building was of brick in colonial style, with deeply recessed porch, and pillars. Turning its back on High Street, it faced into its own churchyard, brick-walled and ivied, and containing a few graves. It was erected 1824-25, and was the first denominational building in the village. The plan was furnished, though not designed, by Mr. Jefferson, and the church owns the prayer book used and autographed by him and containing the whole of a hymn which he copied. Being outgrown by its congregation, this church, which stood on the present site, was demolished in 1895. in this place, and also of Walker's church,3 3. Grace Church, Cismont. fifteen miles east of Charlottesville, officiating two Sundays in the month in each of these churches. He was a good classical scholar, and taught quite a large number of the youth of that day. Although not popular with the masses, he was a sterling Christian man, generous, benevolent and plain spoken, and he had in him a vein of dry humor. On one occasion a stranger preached in the Courthouse on a week day evening, who was, we think, an Englishman. In his discourse he had much to say respecting clergymen, and used some severe criticisms respecting their lives and luxurious living, rolling about in costly fourwheeled chariots and coaches. "If," said he, "the vail [sic] that covers the bottomless pit could be lifted, the audience would see these robed clergy, in company with the devil and his angels, enveloped in the flames of hell." A person who was present repeated these remarks to Mr. H., who in the dryest humor said the preacher could not possibly have meant to describe him, as he had never owned any other carriage than a wheelbarrow, and he also remarked that he had told his brother, the Presbyterian minister, Rev. F. Bowman, that possibly he might be meant, as he owned and rode about in a one-horse two-wheeled buggy. It is reported that a man having a basket with chickens on his arm stopped in front of the residence of Mr. H., and hailed him thus: "Can you marry me?" "Yes sir," said the parson. "Will you take chickens for the marriage fee?" "Certainly," was the answer. The chickens were handed over to a servant and the man hailed a woman who was standing a short distance off, "Come on, Sukey, he says he'll take chickens for his pay." The marriage ceremony was performed, the bride and groom standing in the yard, and the parson on the door steps. Another story about this clergyman is, that he rode some distance from town to perform the marriage ceremony, and the groom said, after it was over, "Look-ahere, Parson, I've got no money; won't you take gourds for pay?" The gourds were tied together and thrown across the horse of the minister, and he rode to town with them dangling on either side of his saddle, to the no small amusement of the people along the route. Rev. Mr. Hatch had good vegetable gardens in which he was fond of working in the early morn and at evenings, and here he might be seen using his carriage, the wheelbarrow. The first fig tree we ever saw which bore fruit was reared by Mr. H. The ministrations of Mr. Hatch continued for about five years, when he removed to the State of New York, where he died several years since. On the opposite side of the street was a small brick house in which Mrs. Davenport, sister to Alexander and Ira Garrett, Esqs., resided. This house was afterwards enlarged, and is now the Piedmont Female Institute.4 4. Now the Children's Home, 710 East Market Street. We do not now know the name of the school conducted by Mr. Mirick. Under Mrs. Meade, and later the Misses Meade, an Episcopal school named the Piedmont Female Institute was conducted successfully here for two generations. It closed in 1905. See Mrs. Jennie Thornley Grayson, "Piedmont Institute Catalogue, 18571858," Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, Vol. II (1941-42), pp. 9-[16]. About the year 1835, the late Col. J. R. Watson resided here and built a two-story wooden tenement for his mercantile business. This building was in later years used for a female academy by Rev. S. H. Mirick, a Baptist clergyman, now in Washington city; and when he enlarged the brick house to its present dimensions, the wooden building was removed down the turnpike road, and is at this time the residence of Mr. C. L. Thompson. Rev. Mr. Mirick had a large and flourishing school here for several years when he was succeeded by Col. Richard Wyatt, and he by Miss Annie Leaton, now Mrs. R. K. Meade, who is the principal at this time of the Institute. The Blue Ridge Turnpike Company,5 5. The Blue Ridge and Rivanna Turnpike, built by a local corporation of which Opie Norris was Secretary and Treasurer. It ran from the Woolen Mills west, varying from the old Three Notched (stage) Road in its course through town, but joining and largely co-inciding with it to its destination at Brooksville, near the foot of Afton Mountain. Tolls were taken. The east end of this turnpike is the present East Market Street. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 70. in 1828-29, opened the road to the Meriwether bridge, a short distance from the Secretary ford. The old stage road up to that time was through Carlton,6 6. On March 12, 1812, Richard Overton conveyed 800 acres lying on a spur of Monticello and on both sides of Moore's Creek (Deed Book 18, p. 27), to Charles L. Bankhead and wife. Overton had bought the land a few years earlier, a part from Edward Carter, the larger portion from Nicholas M. Lewis of The Farm. Its eastern line joined Monticello "near a remarkable hole in the ground." Young Bankhead was the son of Dr. John Bankhead of Caroline County, Virginia, and in 1808 had married Anne Cary Randolph, daughter of Gov. Thomas Mann Randolph of Edgehill and granddaughter of Jefferson. They built Carlton, the name presumably being formed from that of the owner. Charles Bankhead was not a successful manager, and in 1815 Dr. Bankhead was appointed trustee and resided with his son. In 1833 Carlton was purchased by Judge Alexander Rives of the Castle Hill family. He was a prominent lawyer, serving in both houses of the State Legislature, as member of Congress, and as Judge of the United States Court for the Western District of Virginia, following the War between the States. Under his care this was a beautiful place. In 1874 (Deed Book 68, p. 486), he sold to B. H. Brennan of Buffalo, New York, who for a short time conducted a private bank in Charlottesville. Mr. Brennan at his own expense made a $75,000 private macadam road from Market Street to Carlton, one of the first examples of this method of road-building in the county. This is now Carlton Ave. Later, Carlton was the home of R. H. Rawlings. The house was burned, 1894-95; a second house was built but is no longer standing, and the site has become a cemetery, the Monticello Memorial Park. the farm of Col. Bankhead, now the property of B. H. Brennan, Esq., and came out a little below the residence of S. W. Ficklin. A former resident of the little brick house was Mr. Jacob Wimer, a blacksmith, an industrious, hard-working mechanic; he was the owner of no real estate, but by his business acquired a sufficiency to rear and educate his family, and lived in comfortable circumstances. He was respected and trusted by his neighbors. He had a son by the name of John, who had been reared by his father to habits of industry and hard work in his shop. John Wimer was bright, intelligent and of quick parts. His education was of the kind usually to be acquired in the private schools of that day in this vicinity. In the year 1829-30, Mr. Jacob Wimer and family emigrated to the West, to better their condition, and made St. Louis, Mo., their home. There the old business was pursued by both father and son, and prosperity attended their labors. The son improved his mind by study, and conducted himself in a way to secure the respect and confidence of his neighbors and the citizens of St. Louis; he became popular, was elected Mayor of that city, in which capacity he served several years, was judge of one of the courts and President of the Pacific railroad. In the late war he was Colonel of a regiment in the Confederate Army and was killed at Hartsville, Ky. The next lot is the Old Stage Yard7 7. 610-616 East Market Street, now the site of the Home Laundry. of the late J. N. C. Stockton, Esq. West of this, where Dr. John Thornley resides in his beautiful house,8 8. This was one of the earliest building sites, Joel Terrell, who died in 1773, having had his home here. The Mr. Butler mentioned was an Irish political refugee. Dr. John Thornley, Surgeon in the U. S. Navy, brought his family to this home in 1867, where they resided until his death in 1887. He was born in King George County, Virginia, commissioned in 1841, and saw service, in the old sailing vessels, through the Mexican War and in many seas. He was a vestryman of Christ Church for nearly twenty years, and a warden at the time of his death. He is remembered as having appeared before the Town Council to protest the building of a livery stable in the heart of the town, stating that long observation had led him to believe the fly to be one of the greatest enemies of the human race. Being well ahead of his day, his warning was disregarded and the stable erected. once the Farmers' Bank of Virginia, stood a two-story wooden building, 40 by 20 feet, which connected with a mansion in the centre of the lot which, in the early days of the town, was kept as a hotel. This property for 50 years belonged to the family of Mr. Butler, a cabinetmaker, whose widow married Mr. Fowler, father of our townsman, Mr. C. L. Fowler,9 9. A story survives of Mr. C. L. Fowler's childhood which should be of general interest. As a small boy it was his custom to sit on a gate post at this home, and he would frequently speak to Mr. Jefferson as he rode past. A friendship developed and it was a common sight to meet the old statesman on his way around town, with the child "riding behind." After some years he obtained for his protege a berth on a ship of the navy, but as the boy was only twelve years old, his mother refused her consent. and who, with his half-brothers, Alexander and James Butler, sold it to the Farmers' Bank and to the late John B. Dodd. In the year 1781, the Legislature of Virginia held its sessions in these buildings, when Tarleton with his cavalry made their raid into the town to capture Mr. Thomas Jefferson, the members of the Legislature and the 6,00010 10. An error. See post, p. 54. British and Hessian prisoners of Gen. Burgoyne's army, who were encamped on the farm now belonging to George Carr, Esq., six miles northwest from Charlottesville. Tarleton failed in his expedition to capture Mr. Jefferson and the Legislature,11 11. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 46, says: ". . . It is a question of some interest where the Legislature held its sessions. . . . No authentic tradition in regard to it has been handed down. It has been claimed, that they convened in the tavern which stood on the corner of Market and Fifth Streets, where the City Hall now stands. The same claim has been made respecting the old Swan Tavern. The house [no longer standing], which is situated in the rear of the late Thomas Wood's, and which is said to have been removed from the public square in front of the court house as a cottage of the Eagle Tavern, has also been pointed out as the building; but it is not likely that the Eagle Tavern was built as early as the Revolutionary War. The strong possibility is that the courthouse was the place of their meeting. It may have been this circumstance that brought Tarleton's vengeance on its contents; and for nearly fifty years subsequent to that date, it afforded accommodation to almost all the public assemblies of the town, both civil and ecclesiastical." and the prisoners were too well guarded by patriotic troops for the British colonel to make the attempt, with the force he then had under him, to capture them. By the way, the negroes at Monticello still deceive visitors by showing them the marks on the floor of the hall in that building which they say were made by the hoofs of the horse Tarleton rode into the dwelling of Mr. Jefferson. Col. Tarleton never was at Monticello; he stayed in town, and his lieutenant-colonel, McCloud, had charge of the squad sent up there, and he would not permit any of his men to enter the house of Mr. Jefferson or destroy the property. The old Stone Tavern, or, as it was called, the Central Hotel,12 12. Its site is now occupied by the Market Street Motors, 402-414 East Market Street. It was at this hotel that an address and public reception were tendered Lafayette upon his visit to Mr. Jefferson in November 1824. There have been at least three Central Hotels in Charlottesville. built in 1806 by the late James Monroe, the 5th President of the United States, occupied the lot opposite the Fowler residence, and in 1858 was kept by Mr. Joel W. Brown. At that time he boarded his guests and furnished them with lodging rooms at eight dollars per month. The late Mr. Thomas Grady was his bar-keeper and chief manager. In after years the fourstory brick building now known as the Monticello house was built and attached to the Stone Tavern, which attracted a large traveling custom till the advent of railroads, when the property was sold to the Baptists for a female Seminary. During the late war the Monticello House was used as a hospital for the sick and wounded of the Confederate army. In 1852 [1862?] the stone building was destroyed by fire, while occupied by the sick soldiers, and since the war the stone materials were used in the erection of the Charlottesville Milling and Manufacturing Company's building. The wooden house that for several years stood on the lot on the corner of Market and Union streets was brought up from Milton, when that place ceased to be a business mart, and this was the house that the late Martin Dawson, Esq., made his fortune in a large part of which he bequeathed to the University of Va., and the counties of Albemarle and Nelson, for educational purposes. Last year the house was again taken down and put up near town on the Scottsville Road, on land that was part of the farm of Alexander Garrett, Esq. March 4, 1874 In a former paper, we stated that one of the objects of the raid made by Col. Tarleton in 1781 in this place, was to capture the 6,000 English and Hessian prisoners encamped in this vicinity, Such has been the generally received opinion among our citizens, but is a mistake; these prisoners were removed from here for safekeeping, some time previous to the visit of Tarleton, and no more than 2,8001 1. Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Governor Henry, Mar. 27, 1779, estimates the number of Barracks prisoners as four thousand. Memoir, Correspondence and Miscellanies of Thomas Jefferson, edited by T. J. Randolph, Vol. I, p. 157. were ever captured during the Revolution. On the corner of Market and Union [East 4th] streets, where Mr. Joseph Bowman resides, was the residence of Mr. Peter Lott. He is represented to have been a fine looking man, sensible, friendly and charitable. He was a Mason in good standing and of good repute. He owned the whole lot on which the houses of Mr. Bowman, Dr. Dabney,2 2. 307 East Market Street. Recently occupied by the Blue Ridge Club. It was built by Dr. Hughes, and later the home of Dr. Wm. Cecil Dabney of the Dunlora family, who became Professor of the Practice of Medicine at the University of Virginia in 1886. This house was at one time the home of Dr. W. C. N. Randolph, whose later home was razed to make way for the Charlottesville Public Library. F. M. Wills'3 3. Now 211 4th Street, N. E. residence, and adjoining buildings, and the old Baptist church building4 4. This stood on the southwest corner of East Jefferson and North Fourth Streets, facing on Fourth Street. Later it was made into apartments and at length razed. now stand. Mr. Lott was never married, and by his will gave this property to the heirs of Peter Schenck. This Mr. Schenck was the owner of the lot west of the Episcopal church, on which the fine Mansard mansion5 5. 315 2nd Street, N. W. The first builder upon this site was Cornelius Schenk, who bought the lot in 1792. Mr. Massie erected the present dwelling soon after the War between the States; it is believed that four rooms of the original building were retained. Later, this was known as the Harrison Robertson place. of N. H. Massie, Esq., now stands; and he also owned the hill adjoining it, down to, and perhaps included, the stream called Schenck's (Skank's) branch. The Schenck family removed to Ohio, and Gen. Schenck, now United States Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, is a descendant of this family. (Gen. Schenck, in 1861 captured our friend, S. W. Ficklin, and kept him a prisoner for ten days, taking good care of him all the time, feasting him, furnishing him with newspapers, cigars, &amp;c., but failed to convince him that secession was wrong. In 1847 when S. W. Ficklin was travelling in Europe, he made an Austrian General get out of bed and give him a passport, which prevented his passing three lonesome days in Austria. Gen. Schenck was not quite so accommodating to the Belmont farmer.) Mr. Lott, we have been informed, died in 1801, and was buried in the square of land that he owned. Up to 1840, and perhaps later, a handsome gravestone, with Masonic emblems on it, could be seen there. Mr. T. W. Savage, who occupied the Lott house from 1828 to 1840, informs us that the remains of Peter Lott were never removed; the tombstone is not standing there now; it may have been removed when the late Dr. Hughes built the fine brick residence now owned by Dr. Dabney. The late Hardin Massie and Mr. John Cochran, in 1826, purchased this lot, the latter soon afterwards selling his half of it to Dr. Massie. In 1831 the newly constituted Baptist church purchased the north-east corner of this lot and erected a house of worship thereon which they occupied till 1855, when they built their present large and commodious church on the corner of Church [2nd N. E.] and Jefferson streets. The houses on Jefferson street where Mr. Heller and Mr. L. Waddell6 6. Error. Upon his arrival in Charlottesville in 1874 Mr. Lyttelton Waddell resided on the south side of Market Street near 3rd. The building still stands, having been moved to face on 3rd, 112 3rd St., N. E. Mr. Waddell afterwards occupied the old house on Green Street, now 511 N. First Street, the home of Mrs. J. Webb Fry. This building was burned on the night of Dec. 21, 1880, the Waddell family's narrow and sensational escape creating great excitement in the little community. (W. W. Waddell, "Charlottesville in 1875," Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, Vol. II (1941-42), p. 5.) Earlier, this had been a Gilmer home, and after being rebuilt within the original walls it was for long the home of Mrs. Bayard Randolph. To the south of this house, at No. 509, was the home of Mr. George Perkins, son of Judge William Allen Perkins of Cumberland County. He was one of the outstanding members of the strong bar of that period, and practised law in partnership with his father-in-law, Judge Egbert R. Watson, the firm being for years Watson and Perkins. Later, it became Perkins and Perkins, then Perkins, Perkins and Walker, and is now Perkins, Battle and Minor. The large brick dwelling farther north, No. 521, was built before 1876 by Alexander P. Abel, a teller in the Monticello Bank. It was long the home of Mr. Carter H. Page of the Keswick family, and then of Mr. Frank A. Massie, whose family are still its owners. On the east side of this street, No. 436, is the dwelling built in 1873 by Mrs. Virginia Hancock, widow of Dr. Francis Hancock of Richmond. It remains the home of members of this family. reside were erected some dozen years since. In the middle of Market street, west of Dr. Dabney, stood the market house, which was used as such for several years, and was then demolished; another market house was afterwards erected on the same street, two squares west, and this has also been demolished, and now we have five butchers' stalls in the town, two of them flanking the Jeffersonian office, north and south. The brick house on the corner of Market and School [East 3rd] streets, by the first market house, was the property of, and occupied by, Daniel Keith, an Irishman, who acted in the capacity of constable; we knew him as an enthusiastic Democrat. The late Dr. James Leitch, soon after he commenced the practice of medicine, resided in this house, previous to the one he purchased on High Street,7 7. Now the home of Dr. J. O. Mundy, 115 East High Street. Dr. James A. Leitch purchased this lot, Nov., 1848, from Dr. William S. White, pastor of the Presbyterian Church and head of the Presbyterian Female Seminary, which he conducted at his home on 2nd Street, now the Presbyterian Manse. No improvements are listed in the sale, so it is inferred that Dr. Leitch built the house. Following his death, it became the home of his daughter, Mrs. A. P. Bibb, and was long the home of this family. A block to the east, 215 East High Street, is one of the old houses of the town. J. A. G. Davis is believed to have built it, and to have made it his home during the building of his permanent home, The Farm, as in 1825 he bought this lot from Charles Brown, "with all appurtenances," but no house specifically mentioned. In 1827 he sold to his sister-in-law, Martha Jane Minor, widow of Dabney Minor, the house being mentioned, and rights to use of the pump being granted to neighbors living on that block, they paying their pro rata share towards its upkeep. The street is called "North Street, or Maiden Lane." Following the death at the University of J. A. G. Davis, his family returned to their old home at The Farm, later coming to live in this house, presumably with Mrs. Davis's sister, Mrs. Minor. In 1864 (Albemarle County Deed Book 61, p. 140), Robert N. Trice and Lucy Jane his wife (daughter of Mrs. Minor, d. 1860) sold to Benjamin Wood, who in 1876 sold to Jennie L. Burnley, wife of Horace B. Burnley, (ibid., Book 70, p. 97). It remained their home until the 1890's. Horace B. Burnley served as Clerk of the County Court, being succeeded in office by Snowden Wood of Ivy, and in turn by William L. Maupin, Sr., and Drury Burnley, brother of the above. The next house to the east, 303 East High Street, was built, prior to the War Between the States, by Mrs. Julia Stricker Coles, widow of Isaac A. Coles of Enniscorthy, who made it her home. It was afterwards the home of Henry Shackelford of Culpeper, Judge of the Circuit Court, who died in 1880. Mrs. Gen. Long next lived and taught here for a few years, and it was later bought by Trustees of the Presbyterian Church and used for a Presbyterian Girls' School, under Dr. Young. In 1897, Mr. R. P. Valentine bought the property from the Trustees (Charlottesville Corporation Court Deed Book 8, p. 206), and made it his home. It is still the home of a descendant. (Maiden Lane) where he died June 5th, 1862. The old Presbyterian church,8 8. This stood at 200 East Market Street. Upon the building of the present Charlottesville Presbyterian Church in 1897 the "Gothic" building became for a while the Y. M. C. A. Business buildings now occupy the spot. The pastor of this church from 1866 to 1877 was Dr. Edgar Woods, author of the [History of] Albemarle County, to whom all succeeding local antiquarians must feel indebted. Born in 1827, he was a scion of the Albemarle family and a descendant of the original Michael Woods. In 1877 he purchased Pantops and founded the well-known Academy there. For many years his stalwart figure was a familiar sight at the Clerk's Office, where his leisure hours were spent in scanning the then unindexed county records. His death occurred in 1908. Anne Eliza Sampson, Kith and Kin . . . (Richmond, Va., 1922), pp. 114, 121-23. on the corner of Church and Market streets, was erected in 1828, and opened for public worship in the Summer of 1829. This building was a plain brick structure which stood till 1856, when it was taken down and the present Gothic church erected. One of the doors of this old church is now the door to the tobacco factory of Richard Flannagan, on Random Row. All the houses west of this church, on Market street have been erected in late years. The Disciples' (Christian) Church was built in 1836. The corporation limits in 1828 did not extend farther west than the square on which the second market house was erected. The lane passing along the tannery9 9. This tannery in part was upon the present site of the A. and P. Super Market, W. Market Street. The C. L. Fowler lot was the one on Vinegar Hill now used by the Fowler's Valet Cleaners, 228 W. Main Street. It originally had a frontage of sixty-five feet. of James Bishop, and the east end of the lot now owned by Mr. C. L. Fowler, was the line west, and the line east10 10. Now the site of the eastern end of the Monticello Hotel on the Square. The small wooden Collier house no longer stands, but it was on the south side of East Main, between Fifth and Seventh Streets. was along the Eagle Tavern, (Farish House) and the chimney of the house occupied by T. P. Collier, on Main street. The lots on the north-side of High street were added to the corporation several years after the town was incorporated, we believe by Mr. Jouett, and as they did not correspond in width with those of the other lots laid off in 1762, all our cross streets are irregular, as any person can see by looking. The Episcopal church projects some distance out into the street, according to the old plan, but, perhaps, correct according to Jouett's addition. On the square of Peter Lott, quite a number of persons were buried, and on one of the lots of the late Alexander Garrett, Esq., adjoining his residence, now the property of Rev. T. W. Ware,11 11. T. A. Ware was a Methodist minister. His wife was Jeannie Pretlow, grand-daughter of Alexander Garrett. Garrett Street was originally named Pretlow Street. many persons were interred, and gravestones are still to be seen there. A Presbyterian minister by the name of Lumpkin, Dr. Jameson and other prominent citizens of that day, are interred there. The lot where Drury Wood, Esq., now resides, the Methodist church lots, and the adjacent lots were burial places for many persons. It seems to us that the relatives and friends of those who are thus interred in private town lots ought to have their remains removed ere the necessity occurs to erect dwellings on them and the bones of many a good person scattered about and trampled under the feet of the present generation. March 11, 1874 One day last week we stood in the cemetery of the late Col. Nimrod Bramham, while the remains of his greatgrand-daughter were interred, and the voice of prayer ascended to heaven from the lips of Rev. J. C. Long, the Baptist pastor. The cemetery is a large enclosed square of ground, and the dead for five or more generations repose there. It is a quiet, sunny spot, and the periwinkle which creeps around the tombs of the silent dead was in full bloom, its bright blue flowers contrasting with the dark chocolate of the soil. Col. Nimrod Bramham and his wife, Margaret, were the parents of a large family; on all sides of their graves, their descendants also sleep. They were good people, followers of Him who gave His life a ransom for the lost. An obelisk of white marble stands nearly in the centre, on which is engraved "Our Parents"; on one side of the shaft, Wm. A. Bibb, and on the other side Sarah R. Bibb. Mrs. Bibb was the oldest daughter of Col. Nimrod and Margaret Bramham, and W. A. Bibb was her husband. Then there is the grave of Dr. Horace Bramham, cut off in the springtime of life and usefulness. A white tablet records the decease of John Simpson, the son-in-law of Col. Bramham. Here repose also, the remains of Dr. Wyatt W. Hamner, another son-in-law of Col. Bramham, and here are the remains of Edward J. Timberlake, the son-inlaw of W. A. Bibb, and now his daughter, Mrs. Nellie T. Smith finds a resting place among her kindred, who have preceded her to the grave. Other persons, the friends of Col. Bramham's family, also rest here. The children of Wm. and Nancy Garland, Mr. John and Martha Smithson. Immediately next to the grave of Wm. and Sarah Bibb are three large tombs, on the top of each rest marble tops; one reads, Elizabeth Garland, born 1767, died Nov., 1840. Erected by her children. On one side of her is her grandson, Robert Slaughter, died July, 1840, aged 15 years 4 months. On the other side lies Elizabeth Slaughter. Mrs. Garland and Mrs. Smithson, previous to marriage, were named Hamner. In another enclosure near this cemetery lies the body of Mr. William J. Fife. It is well to sit around the tombs of those whom we once knew; it brings to remembrance the happiness enjoyed in their company while living, and the good which has resulted from their example of piety and trust in God, and of the further necessity of being, like them, prepared for death. The fine brick mansion on the farm now occupied [by] Rev. James Fife, was erected by Col. Bramham about 1824.1 1. This property was conveyed to Nimrod Bramham by Jesse Winston Garth, April 11, 1818. Colonel Bramham built the present house in the same year. Rawlings, Ante-Bellum Albemarle, p. 53. The place was formerly owned by Gen. Winston Garth, who removed to Alabama. Both Gen. Garth and Col. Bramham, had been members of the House of Delegates in the Virginia Legislature, from Albemarle County. April 8, 1874 Main Street as It Was in 1828 and as It Is at This Time.—This street, when we first knew it, had few houses, and only two or three business places on it, now it has from one end to the other, fine houses and substantial business stores; then it was rough, and in winter season with mud enough to stall wagons passing over it; now it is macadamized and is well graded; then there were only patches of paved sidewalks, now there are wide sidewalks laid with brick or slate its entire length; the width of the street is 66 feet, which is, we believe, the width of all the streets in the corporation running east and west, and the cross streets running north and south are 33 feet wide. Opposite the eastern end of Main street stands a twostory double wooden house,1 1. Recently demolished. The site, still marked by one fine magnolia, is now the East End Merchants' Association Parking Lot. This house was bought about 1873 by Mr. S. M. Keller, and remained the Keller home for two generations. with a garden in front of it of beautiful flowers, shrubs, &amp;c., belonging to the estate of the late Ira Garrett. This house appears to be swaying through its centre; the southern half was brought up from Milton, and attached to the other half, which has a portico on the northern side. Dabney Carr, one of the Judges of the Court of Appeals, and nephew of Th. Jefferson, resided here. The entrance to Main street from the vicinity of the railroad depot is narrow and crooked; the original boundary of the town extended only to a straight line with the chimney of the small wooden house on the south side of the street, now occupied by T. Collier; as you come up from the depot, the brick house2 2. Still standing, 611 East Main Street. on the right hand side, faces the centre of Main street; it had, when built, but one room, and report says was once occupied by William Wirt as a law office. Rev. F. W. Hatch and Thomas Walker Maury taught school in this house. Judge Watson and Henry Benson were pupils of the former gentleman. Mr. Hatch was an Episcopal minister, who settled in this town in 1819, and preached here until 1831; he first resided in the house where Dr. Rogers3 3. This old wooden house, which stood on the north side of East High Street, between 3rd and 4th, was one of those brought to Charlottesville from Milton, upon the decline of that town. It was moved, and is now at 411 4th Street, N. E. now lives on High street; and in 1821, built the house4 4. 200 East Seventh Street. See p. 46, n. 1. where our editor, A. R. Blakey, resides. On that occasion Mr. Hatch received the following letter from Mr. Jefferson, which deserves imitation from the friends of the resident clergymen of this town: "Monticello, Dec. 8, '21. "Dear Sir:—In the antient feudal times of our good old forefathers, when the Seigneur married his daughter or knighted his son, it was the usage for his vassals to give him a year's rent extra, in the name of an aid. I think it as reasonable, when our pastor builds a house, that each of his flock should give him an aid of a year's contribution. I enclose mine, as a tribute of justice, which of itself, indeed, is nothing, but as an example, if followed, may become something. In any event, be pleased to accept it as an offering of duty, and a testimony of my friendly attachment and high respect. "Th. Jefferson. "Rev. Mr. Hatch." By the way, it is said that Rev. Mr. Hatch was one of the most successful of gardeners, and one of his productions was the rearing cucumbers seven feet in length. This brick house [611 East Main] was afterwards the property of Abram Zigler, the pump maker, who added to its dimensions. Mr. Zigler was a good and honest citizen, whom we well remember; he and his wife and children have all passed away to the better land. The town in 1761-2 was laid out in squares of one acre, each square embracing two lots. Commencing on the left hand [south] side of Main Street, we come to lots No. 29, 30; the first house, brick, was built by Mrs. Tacy Zigler, and is now the property of her grand-daughter, Mrs. Maria Payne, and at present in the occupancy of J. A. Peck; the next house, also brick, was built by Mrs. Zigler, who sold it to Miss Ann Logan, for many years a ladies' dress-maker; now it belongs to Dr. Hart, and A. W. Tinsley occupies it as a residence. On lot 30, (where once stood a blacksmith shop belonging to Opie Norris,) a large, double three-story building5 5. Now 500 East Main Street, the site of the Stop and Shop Super Market. was erected by John Mannoni, the confectioner, some 15 years since. The Citizens National Bank is in one of the basement rooms, and the other James Goodman occupies as a grocery store. The Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias orders have lodges in the third story, and the second story is rented out for chambers. On the opposite [north] side of the street, lots No. 15 and 16, on the corner of the first cross street [E. 5th], stood a one-story wooden house6 6. Now the site of the Monticello Drug Company, 501 East Main Street. where David Fowler carried on the cabinet and furniture business. The door of this house was solid and massive, and regularly laid off into small squares with wrought iron nails, and was made to last for centuries. This house was probably among the first built when the town was established. A man by the name of David Spradling, who walked upon his hands and feet lived here for several years, and the place was designated as the Cockroach Hotel. Where this old house once stood, Addison Maupin erected the brick house now occupied by Geo. T. Johnson as a store; he also erected the large three-story stuccoed house north of it, on Court [5th] street, now owned and occupied by William T. Early. The Farmer's and Merchants Bank, adjoining the store of Johnson on Main Street, is also a recent brick structure. The Brick mansion east of this was built by the late John B. Dodd, and is now the property and residence of Luther Sneed. Crossing to the other side of Court [5th] street are lots 17 and 18,7 7. On these once vacant lots, Nos. 425-429 E. Main Street, now stand the Dixie Cigar &amp; News Company, the Leather Shop, and Robertson's Shoe Repairing Shop. and the whole square was once the property of James Monroe, and known as the Central Hotel property (the Central Hotel having occupied the Market St. end); the portions on Main street were divided into six house lots and have been sold to various parties; the three divisions of lot 17 are still vacant; and on lot 18 are two small wooden structures, one of which is occupied by W. J. Smith as a gunsmith store, and the other by J. N. Pierce as a tin manufactory; adjoining these is a large, double, three-story brick dwelling, occupied by Payne and Thomasson, and by J. J. Gleason8 8. 401 East Main Street. This site has been occupied by the Gleason firm since 1873. About 1870 John J. Gleason of Gleason's Gap, near Shipman, Nelson County, Virginia, entered business on the present site of Brown's Gift Shop, the firm being then known as Gleason and Bibb. Three years later Mr. Gleason bought control and moved to the present site. Upon his sale to his son, Henry Morris Gleason, in 1875, the firm became Gleason and Bailey, and so continued until this partnership was dissolved in 1903. Mr. H. M. Gleason continued in business until 1925, and was succeeded by his son, J. Emmett Gleason, thus making three generations of this family in this company and upon this site. as grocery stores. The second story over Gleason is the photograph gallery of Tyson and Perry, and the rooms of Dr. J. W. Scribner, the dentist; the other chambers are used for a private dwelling. The part of this property on the corner of Union [E. 4th] street is now owned by Rev. J. C. Long, and the other part by B. Oberdorfer. On the opposite [south] side of Main street are lots 31 and 32; on the corner of Court street is a large wooden building,9 9. Now the site of Thomas' Furniture Company, 420 East Main Street. which, when we first recollect it, was occupied as a carriage manufactory by Mr. John Tompkins, and afterwards by Mr. Pinkard as cabinet manufactory; at one time this property was occupied as a store where liquors were sold by a rare genius, named Samuel Toms, who had a sign, on which was painted a heart; on the occasions of the militia officers' muster he would treat the whole batallion; he was of a litigious temperament, and almost always had some suit at law; he was a noted character in all this region. In the time of Nat Turner's rebellion10 10. Nat Turner's Insurrection took place in Southampton County, Virginia, south of the James, in the summer of 1831. It was the result of abolitionist propaganda. Turner, a Negro, killed his master, mistress and their children with an axe, and gathered a band which murdered sixty-one persons, almost all of whom were women and children. Governor Floyd took prompt action, called out the militia, and the ringleaders were captured. Turner and some others were tried for murder and executed on the gallows, some death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, and some of the Negroes were pardoned. As a result of this upheaval, many petitions were sent to the next Legislature, 1831-32. These were referred to a select committee. In this, Thomas J. Randolph of Edgehill, Albemarle County, son of Governor Thomas Mann Randolph and grandson of Thomas Jefferson, moved Jefferson's postnatal scheme of 1779 for the gradual abolition of slavery. After three days' discussion the committee reported "that it is inexpedient for the present to make any legislative enactment for the abolition of slavery." This was contested in the House, and at length Archibald Bryce of Goochland County proposed a compromise amendment which was adopted: "Profoundly sensible of the great evils arising from the colored population of the Commonwealth, induced by humanity as well as policy," that there be an immediate effort for the removal of the State's free Negroes, "and that a further action for the removal of the slaves should await a more definite development of public opinion." Tyler, Hist. of Va., Vol. II, pp. 463-64. the town authorities of Charlottesville had patrols out every night, and on one occasion, Toms was on duty on horseback in the outskirts of the town; he had a tin trumpet, a blast from which was the signal of danger, on hearing of which a gun was to be fired off at headquarters. Sometime about midnight Toms heard a heavy rumbling, (which proved to be a wagon rolling over a hard road,) and thinking the enemy coming, rode, Gilpin-like to town, giving loud blasts from his trumpet; opposite headquarters were encamped several mountain wagoners with their horses; on hearing Toms' signal the gun was fired off, causing a stampede of the wagoners' horses, which, with the screaming of the owners and the hurried assembling of the citizens made quite an exciting and amusing scene. One of the habitues of Toms' establishment was a man by the name of Jesse Burroughs, whom some of our older citizens may remember, as a jovial kind fellow. This property is now owned by James M. Smith, and has been since the war remodeled; the lower half is occupied by Geo. M. McIntire, druggist and by Mrs. Omohundro as a millinery store. The upper stories are used for private families. The next structure is the fanciful wooden building with circular headings, also the property of Mr. Smith, and is the large dry goods, grocery and provision establishment of Smith &amp; Norman, who keep six or more clerks employed day and night. Additions and alterations have been made to the original house, and the store is probably 100 feet in depth. It is to be hoped when our bachelor friend Smith gets to be a rich man, (do men ever get rich?) he will imitate his next door neighbors and erect an elegant and substantial stone or brick block of buildings to take the place of his inflammable tinderbox; the deformities of which are hid by the handsome stores on his west side. The two large and commodious stores next to Smith &amp; Norman, built by S. M. Keller and J. W. Lipop occupy the place of a one and half wooden house, once the property, we believe, of the father of Jno. L. O'Neal. These stores are 80 feet in depth, the first occupied by A. Brunn &amp; Co. for dry goods, and the other by Th. J. Wertenbaker, merchant tailor and clothier. The next store11 11. 400 East Main Street, the site of Brown's Gift Shop. on the corner of Union [East 4th] street was built by the late William S. Johnson and was sold to J. W. Lipop in 1872, who remodeled it and has the store room for his extensive watch and jewelry establishment. The upper part and the chambers over the two adjoining new stores are occupied by John M. Godwin as the residence of his family. The second cross street, (Union) the lots 19 and 20 [north side] had on it two small wooden buildings in 1828, the one on the corner, erected doubtless 60 years previous, was a type or style of the other original houses; it was old &amp; dilapidated when we first knew it; this was the one store which the Miltonians sarcastically alluded to when comparing it with their great importing emporium, which now is non est. When Col. Tarleton made his raid here in 1781, he seized the goods found in this store and had them burned on the street in front of it, and the liquors were poured into the gutters. This was done probably to prevent his troops from imbibing the fiery liquids. The Charlottesville Advocate was printed in this house when Mr. Reinhart was its editor, and his family resided in a part of the house. Mr. Ebenezer Watts, the bookbinder once lived here, and afterwards John B. Dodd had his cabinet shop here. There is a daguerrean picture of this old building extant as it existed in 1845, taken by Mr. Retzer. The large three-story stuccoed building12 12. This building, with its high steps on 4th Street, N. E., still stands. now occupying this spot, was built for the Monticello Bank, now the National Bank, and the Albemarle Insurance Company. This building is about 40 feet in height. There are two stores on the Main street, one of them extending perhaps 125 feet on Union street, which is occupied by F. M. Wills, druggist and pharmaceutist; the other store by Spooner &amp; Keller, hardware merchants. The Bank occupies the front part of the second story, the Albemarle Insurance Company and the Charlottesville Milling Company have their offices in the other rooms on this floor. The third story has a large hall extending the whole length of this building, which is the Friends of Temperance hall, and is also used by the Mendelssohn Musical Society. The Young Men's Christian Association has its library and lecture room on this floor. The handsome stuccoed one-story building north of this building on Union street is the Post office.13 13. 105 4th Street, N. E. On Main street, west of Spooner &amp; Keller, is a twostory stuccoed building with high pitched rooms, owned by George &amp; Watson, who have an extensive grocery store in the lower part. This lot 19, was in old times the property of Hays Isaacs, a German Jew, whose family emigrated West. The next lot, 18 [20] was the property of Charles Day, the tailor, who owned it up to 1831-'32. On it was a one-and-half story wooden house, which was afterwards elevated with a brick basement under it, and was used as a dry goods and grocery store, first by Benjamin Ficklin and then by B. &amp; J. Mosby. This was taken down and the stores now occupied by A. Hartnagle, confectioner, and Pace &amp; Marshall, grocers, was built by the late E. J. Timberlake. On the corner of the third cross (School) [East 3rd] street, Wm. B. Phillips built the store and dwelling, now the property and occupied by B. Oberdorfer,14 14. Mr. Oberdorfer settled in Charlottesville before the War between the States. Though a native of Germany, he was southern in sympathies and promptly volunteered, making an excellent record as a soldier. His store (later that of his son, Philip B. Oberdorfer), on the corner of 3rd Street, where Grant's now stands, was for two generations one of the best-known in this section. dry goods merchant, who has added another story to its height.—When the late Wm. Keblinger resided in this house, his son, Caddis, then a child in his nurse's arms, fell from the third story window on School street, and wonderful to say, without injuring him. Now Cad. is a man with a growing family and has the promise of long life. On the opposite [south] side of Main, between Union and School streets, lots No. 33 and 34, in 1828 were only two buildings; one a wooden structure,15 15. Now the site of Timberlake's Drug Company, 322 East Main Street. occupied by Mr. Schroff, tinner, and afterwards by the Chronicle newspaper office; (not the present Chronicle,) this was a quasi democratic sheet, owned, we believe, by Frederick Isaacs, a son of David Isaacs, a Jew, and Nancy West, a mulatto woman, who at one time owned several town lots on Main street. Fred was well educated, and, we think, went to school with the white boys; he loved to frolic and drink; one night when he quit work he left a lighted candle on his case, which set fire to it and to the building, and the office was entirely destroyed. At the other end of the square, lot No. 34, on the corner of School [3rd S. E.] stood a modest brick house16 16. Now the site of the Peoples National Bank, 300 East Main Street. The Peoples Bank was organized as a state bank in 1875; President, A. R. Blakey; Directors: R. G. Crank, H. Clay Marchant, C. H. Harman, Simon Leterman, L. T. Hanckel, A. J. Farish, Jas. T. Durrette, Edw. Coles, Benj. R. Pace, J. Augustus Michie, Jesse W. Jones, Charles Goodyear. It occupied for twenty years the building on the corner of Market and Fourth Streets, now the J. A. Burgess shop, the rental being $150 per annum. Its second location, 1895, was on the corner of Main and Fourth, now Timberlake's drug store, and in 1917 it moved to the present site. In January, 1895, Judge John M. White became President, continuing until his death in 1913. He was succeeded by Geo. R. B. Michie, who served until shortly before his death in 1938. owned by John B. Benson, the father of Henry Benson, a merchant who conducted business, and with his family resided there. Now this whole square has on it substantial and elegant stores and dwellings. The block of three stores, two-thirds of lot 33, is the property of James Alexander, who purchased it from Th. Grady's Executor, in 1844; there were on it then a small two-story brick house and a small wood shop on the corner of Union street, used for a paint shop, this he pulled down, and erected a brick building from Union street to the above house, and afterwards it was altered and additions made in the rear as it now appears. The Jeffersonian office was in the second story over the store room now occupied by Mrs. I. T. Winston for millinery and fancy goods. The middle store room is occupied by M. B. Heller as a dry goods and clothing establishment. The third store is in the occupancy of Balz &amp; Hartman, confectioners. On the other third of lot No. 33 is a brick store and dwelling, and was built by Jane West, sister to Fred Isaacs; she was a neat and tasty milliner, who received the patronage of the ladies in all this vicinity; at one time she was deranged and was sent to the Williamsburg lunatic hospital, and returned cured of her insanity; she owned several slaves, and by will gave freedom to them at her death, but ere that time they became free by President Lincoln's Proclamation; she owned and lived in the house on Church street, now owned by M. M. DuPre, till a few years past, and by will gave her property to the heirs of her former slaves. The house and store on Main street now belongs to Mrs. T. B. Brockman; the store is occupied by Lew Wood, hardware merchant, and the dwelling above by M. B. Heller. Lot No. 34 has four large stores on it; in 1871 onehalf of this lot, one-fourth acre, was sold for upwards of $5,000 to J. H. Bibb and F. T. Andrew who have erected stores extending 80 or 90 feet in depth. A. P. Bibb &amp; Co., merchants, occupy one for the sale of dry goods, and F. T. Andrew the other for boots, shoes and leather. In the rear of Bibb &amp; Co., extending to Water street, is a large warehouse now occupied by Geo. Johnson, commission merchant. Next to the store of F. T. Andrew is a large brick house, with two stores; one is the dry goods store of Patterson &amp; Cochran, and the other the clothing emporium of A. Myers, whose dwelling is over these stores. John B. Benson was the owner of all of lot 34; it was afterwards purchased by James Johnson, who sold it to Christopher Hornsey, who enlarged the house, and for thirty years conducted a large and lucrative mercantile business here; in the latter part of the war he sold this property to Edward Benner, jeweler, who made large amounts by the purchase of cotton, and he further extended the stores and improved the house, spending thereon $5,000. He also bought the Monticello Hotel and other property in town, and several years since became a banker in Alexandria, Egypt, and now resides in his native land, France. April 15, 1874 Main Street, 1828-1874.—In the paper of last week we gave some account of Main street from its eastern end to the third cross (School) [East 3rd] street. We will now commence at the corner of that and Main street, [north side], lots No. 21 and 22. There were four small houses on this square in 1828; the first, now F. Hartnagle's,1 1. Now the site of the Standard Cut Rate Company, 225 East Main Street. was a small two-story brick store and dwelling, and was formerly the mercantile house of Col. Jno. R. Jones, who owned it, and he had also a store on the Public Square. There was a platform in front of the store, an ascent of several steps led to the store room; these steps were afterwards removed and the floor of the store lowered about four feet. Mr. Martin, a merchant who sold hats and shoes, and who married a daughter of Joseph Harper, had this store till he emigrated to the West. Thomas Grady afterwards kept for several years a grocery store in it. Mr. G. was of a tall, lank and ungainly appearance, his clothes fitting loosely about his person; he was full of jokes, very free spoken and often using, like many of the older residents, profane language; he was, however, friendly, sociable and kindly disposed. He had been a soldier in the war of 1812, and entertained a strong feeling of love and respect for General Andrew Jackson, and a stronger, more determined Democrat did not live in these parts. At the other end of the lot, on Market Street, lived Dr. James A. Leitch, then a young practitioner, full of humor; he kept chained up a tame bear, that often got loose and troubled the neighbors. Bears are very fond of sugar; Bruin one day made a visit to the store of Mr. Grady and took possession of the hogshead of sugar, while the proprietor, afraid to meddle with him, stood aghast hallooing at and berating the beast, but this did not disturb the equanimity of Dr. Leitch's pet, and he ate his fill of the saccharine sweets. Francis Mannoni, confectioner, had this store room for twelve years. The present owner, F. Hartnagle, has enlarged and improved both the store and the house as it now stands; he also built the brick store room adjoining, now occupied by J. M. Daniel &amp; Bro., booksellers, and French A. Balthis, jeweler,2 2. This firm soon after became Balthis and Keller, jewelers and engravers, and later the present Keller and George, which stands across the street from its early site. as well as the tenements north on School [3rd] street. Adjoining the bookstore is an old wooden house with modernized front; J. C. Kelley, tinner, and W. R. Cogbill, barber, are the tenants. The next house is an ancient one, old as the town, perhaps; it has also a modern front; the porch formerly stood several feet on the sidewalk; it belonged to James Leitch, a very successful merchant, an Irishman, who was largely patronized by Mr. Jefferson; he gave it to his sister, Miss Rebecca Leitch, fifty years since, and she is still the owner of it as well as the one occupied by Kelley and Cogbill. In this house a Mr. Dawson taught school. Mrs. Logan and daughters, milliners, once lived here, and then Mr. Joseph Martin, bookbinder, who published the Virginia Gazetteer [in 1835], a large octavo volume, and other works. Mr. A. C. Brechin is now the occupant and deals in fancy goods, picture-frames, prints and wallpaper. The next, west, is a small wooden tenement, belonging to T. W. Savage; Peter Diggs, the barber, occupies it. The next building, a two-and-a-half story dwelling, is the residence of Mr. Savage; the store under it is occupied by L. W. Cox, the gunsmith; it at one time was used for the Post-office, when Wickliffe Hutchinson was post master. There formerly stood on this place a small, one-and-a-half story brick dwelling, where Lyman Peck, deputy sheriff in 1828, and town Sergeant of the corporation, lived; his horse, on one occasion, ran away with him in a buggy, when he jumped out and broke his leg, which had to be amputated, and he died under the operation. His widow and children now reside in Mississippi. Mr. T. W. Savage and E. Watts purchased their property of Andrew Leitch, executor of James Dinsmore, who owned it for several years. Mr. D. lived on the place now owned by Peter Harman,3 3. Now 843 West Main Street, the home of Judge Archibald Douglas Dabney. This property was bought in 1818 by James Dinsmore from Henry W. Alberty, alias Henry Chiles (Albemarle County Deed Book 21, p. 222). It is not certain if the house was then standing or if Dinsmore built it, but he was residing there at the time of his death, 1830 (ibid., Book 29, p. 87). The lot then comprised 7½ acres. Following litigation, it was deeded to William Wertenbaker in 1838 by Andrew Leitch, executor for the Dinsmore estate (ibid., Book 36, p. 319). Mr. Wertenbaker sold in 1842 to Mrs. Nancy Garland (ibid., Book 40, p. 14), and she in 1848 to Richard Duke, who retained it only a few months, selling June 10, 1848, to John Schaaf (ibid., Book 45, p. 535). In 1866 Peter Harman bought from Schaaf (ibid., Book 61, p. 438), and it remains the home of a descendant of this family. It cannot now be determined who planted the long box walk, there being among the various descendants varying legends. near the University. Mr. James Dinsmore and his brother William were by birth Irishmen, and were carpenters, the former, with Mr. Nelson, was a contractor in building the University, and acquired a handsome estate. He lost his life by falling into a stream that flowed through the Orangedale farm.4 4. This farm, comprising 185 acres, was sold in 1832 by John Dinsmore, Sr., heir of James Dinsmore, (ibid., Book 30, p. 128), the purchaser being Joseph Watson, an Irish immigrant who made it his home for many years. Later, Orange Dale was long the home of Mr. James Payne. The house is now in the city limits, being the residence of Morris S. Clark, 7½ Street, S. W. The name indicates the political sympathies of James Dinsmore. Mr. D. left the bulk of his estate to a brother who lived in Louisiana. Mr. Wm. Dinsmore died and was buried at Orangedale. The next building is a one-and-a-half story wooden structure5 5. Now the site of Fitzhugh Bros., 201 East Main Street. extending for some distance up Church [East 2nd] street; it is perhaps one of the old settlers, and we learn, was a mercantile store previous to 1828. Mr. E. Watts, bookbinder, had a small store here for many years; it is now owned by Fred Hartnagle; Meade &amp; Co. keep cigars and tobacco for sale in this store room. Mr. Hartnagle, in 1872, built the handsome brick building on Church street, extending to the Presbyterian church.6 6. That is, extending to the former Presbyterian Church, which stood on the east side of 2nd Street. Crossing over to the opposite [south] side of Main street are lots 35 and 36, extending from the third cross (School) [3rd] street, to the fourth cross (Church) [2nd] street. These lots were owned by Nancy West, a free mulatto woman, and the wife (not lawfully) of David Isaacs, a German Jew. On these two lots, at our first recollection, was a two story wooden house with wings east and west adjoining; David Isaacs did business here, and Nancy West sold cakes, &amp;c. One of the sons of the above couple, Tucker Isaacs, was a painter, and was a good citizen and much respected; he is now a resident of Chillicothe, Ohio, and a man of large property. His brother Frederick was a printer, and both were educated with the whites in this town. Fred. had a natural talent for drawing, and could imitate with accuracy every signature in the Declaration of Independence, even to the palsied, shaking one of Steph. Hopkins, of R. Island. On these lots there are now eight large and commodious brick stores and dwellings. The first7 7. Now the site of M. Kaufman's Sons, 222 East Main Street. This firm, founded by Mr. M. Kaufman, Sr., in 1870, has occupied its present location since about 1885. on the corner of School [3rd] street, was built by Tucker Isaacs, and was sold to F. Potentini, Corsican, who had a confectionery in the old wooden house for several years; he removed to Washington city, and during the late war accumulated a large fortune and returned to France with $100,000. T. and S. M. Keller had a confectionery here. James Lobban afterwards purchased this house, and sold it to Mrs. Mary Keblinger; it is now the property of her children, and the store is occupied by Mrs. Bachrach, milliner; the next two buildings were erected by James Lobban, one store is occupied by J. Bachrach, dry goods merchants, and the other by Henry Benson, auctioneer. The next store room is the hardware establishment of Lobban &amp; Sinclair, and the upper part is the residence of Mr. Lobban. The house was built by Tucker Isaacs. From this store to Church [East 2nd] street, Rev. James Fife purchased, who built the store occupied by A. B. Heller, dry goods and clothing merchant; G. M. McIntire, druggist and apothecary, occupied the store for many years. The next two stores are stuccoed work; the land was sold by Mr. Fife to John Wood, Jr. and John T. Antrim, who erected them. Ed. M. Antrim occupies one for dry goods and S. Bass, clothier, the other. The next building west,8 8. 200 East Main Street, now the site of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company. A. C. Brechin for many years conducted a book store here. on the corner of Church street, is a large three story house, built by Rev. J. Fife; the store Main Street looking East from foot of Vinegar Hill, about 1880 is a deep one and occupied by E. Hechheimer as a clothing house, the upper story Dr. E. S. H. Wise has for a boarding house. The one story L to the old house which stood on this place, Dr. J. Staige Davis had for his office previous to his becoming professor at the University; it was removed down the lot on Church street and is at present occupied by Rev. C. R. Ross as the Depository of the Albemarle Colportage and Sunday School Society, where bibles, tracts and religious publications are sold. A. H. Cleveland is now the owner of this property. The house below the Depository is occupied by C. H. Wingfield, carriage maker, and was the property and residence of Jane West, and not as we stated last week, the place south of it owned by M. M. DuPre. We also stated that the house on the corner of Main and Court streets was built by John Mannoni fifteen years since—it was built in 1866. We next come to lots Nos. 37 and 38 [on south side], once the property of David Isaacs. It was known as the old barracks; by some it is said the name was derived from the fact that Tarleton quartered his troops here in 1781, and others say Gen. Bankhead9 9. Major (Adj. Gen., August 15, 1813) James Bankhead of the 7th Infantry, disbanded June 15, 1815. He was a West Pointer and a first cousin of Charles L. Bankhead of "Carlton." Thomas H. S. Hamersly Complete Regular Army Register of the United States for One Hundred Years (1779-1879) . . . (Washington, D. C., 1880), pp. 97, 110. had his headquarters here in the war of 1812, from which it took its name, which we believe to be the true version. As we first recollect it in 1828, there were only two wooden buildings on these lots, the one now standing and owned by R. S. Jones, and a small one-story tenement which stood a few feet back, where the late J. P. Halbach's house stands. The house on the corner of Church [East 2nd] street is one of the original houses of the place, but the solid timbers are good for a century or more yet. A Mr. Grant, in 1828-29 had a drygoods store here. Bragg &amp; Kelly, Joseph Merrell and Joseph Bishop also occupied it later, then Jesse W. Jones in 1842 purchased it from David Isaacs, and afterwards sold it to his brother, Ro. S. Jones, who is the present owner. He has been altering, adding and building to it on every side, and changing it till it has become almost a light house in the sky. For several years Mr. Retzer had a photograph gallery there, then Jones himself carried on the same business and afterwards Tyson &amp; Perry10 10. Now the site of Pence and Sterling's drug store, 122 East Main Street. had it for the same business. George &amp; Co. occupy the corner store for the drug and apothecary business; J. Tyler Jackson sells confectioneries and has an insurance agency in the next store, and in the next room Charles Thompson has a news agency and a tobacco and cigar store. The large three-story brick building, next to Thompson, was built by R. S. Jones in 1843, in the second story of which Rev. Stephen H. Mirick, a Baptist minister, once had a female seminary. Sterling &amp; Wood occupy one of the stores for Jewelry, watches, etc., and in the other E. Oppenheim has a liquor establishment. On lot No. 36, Peter U. Ware, tinner, did business here forty odd years ago; he was robbed and murdered by two negro men, who followed him from Charlottesville to where the Mount Eagle Baptist church11 11. Near Buck Island. stands, in this county; they had seen him obtain money which they thought was a large amount, but it was only a dollar or two. The negroes were apprehended, tried, convicted and hung. Mr. Ware was a good man, and highly respected, his wife, the daughter of the late Claudius Mayo, still lives in this county; he was a member of the Episcopal church in this town. The next store to Oppenheim was built by John J. Pace, where he once carried on mercantile business, and afterwards in the firm of Pace &amp; Keblinger; Mrs. N. A. Terrell now occupies the store for the millinery business. The next store is the place where for years J. P. Halbach had a merchant tailoring establishment, and of late years a news depot; he built all three of the stores on this lot, to the corner of Green [First] street; next to his place of business Edward Benner, jeweller, did business for several years, and Bear &amp; Conrad also conducted the jewelry business here; recently it was occupied by Jesse W. Jones jr. as a hardware and fancy store. The next store, corner of Green, the 6th cross street, is the place of business of M. Kaufman, grocer.12 12. 100 East Main, now the site of the Style Shoppe. We again cross over to the northern side of Main street, on lots 23 and 24; on these two lots there was only one house erected till of late years, and that house is now standing,13 13. Now the site of the Charlottesville National Bank Building, 123 East Main Street. This was for years the site of the City Post Office. and was, perhaps, built in the town's first days, ere the Revolution; we have been told that it was occupied by Col. Taliaferro, as a public house; this Col. Taliaferro was sheriff of the county, and owned the lots below on the same side of the street, and also the farm belonging to John Fry, near town, on the old Lynchburg road. The house afterwards was the property of Col. Bell, also of the revolutionary army, which had a store in it, and he built an addition on the western end of the house. This house is now as it was when first built, with its thick, heavy doors, and all the timbers are in a good state of preservation; the shingles on the house, after serving for 60 years were taken off, turned over and put on again; it is one and a half stories high, and, like the original buildings, the first floor is elevated several feet above the ground. Jesse Scott, the celebrated fiddler—half Indian, half white—married the daughter of Col. Bell and became the owner of the house and the acre of land attached; his sons, Robert, aged 71, and James, aged 63, are now the owners of the house; both of them play the fiddle every year at one of the watering places in Virginia, and at weddings and parties elsewhere. The Scotts, father and sons, have always stood well in this place, and were respected by every one. On Main street, next to this old house, is a small wooden building in which James Ferguson, the barber and hairdresser, carries on his business; the next is a one-story brick store, occupied by Robertson &amp; Dodd, grocers; the next is a two-story brick building occupied by D. H. Stern,14 14. This shop was later located at 306 East Main Street, now the site of the J. N. Waddell Shoe Co. Mr. Stern's home was on the corner of First and Market Streets, afterwards the residence of his father-in-law, S. Leterman. Later, it became the Old Ladies' Home, and now is the Hill &amp; Irving Funeral Home. boot, shoe and leather dealer; adjoining this is a butcher's stall, kept by colored men. In the next house, F. D. Brockman,15 15. Now the site of the Harris-Norge Sales Co., 105 East Main Street. The late well-known colored barber, John West, used to tell this anecdote: As a partly grown boy he was standing, in March, 1865, in front of Brockman's shop when two strangers on fine horses rode up, gave him their reins and went inside. A little later Mr. Ad. Keblinger came running down Fourth Street, calling had anyone seen Colonel Mosby and Captain Hardy (name not certain). The Yankees were entering Charlottesville by Park Street and these soldiers must be warned. West ran into the shop calling them. Mosby tossed him a silver dollar as they dashed out and, disregarding Keblinger's warning shout to take another way, turned north into Fifth Street on a dead run. (As the main body of Union troops was expected from the west, this was a natural blunder.) West ran at full speed up a side street, saw that the Yankees had already poured into Fifth, and reached High Street in time to see the two Confederates "clear High Street at one jump with mud flying to heaven" and escape down Park Street. That they could thus escape, counterwise to the foe, may possibly be explained by the soldiers having already broken ranks for the usual looting. Forty years later when Colonel Mosby was here on a visit, West showed him the identical dollar and asked if he recalled the incident. Mosby replied that he had some such recollection, but added that "he was seeing so many Yankees about that time, his memories were a bit confused." merchant tailor, has been doing business for near 40 years, and C. C. Ashford, sign painter, has rooms above the store. The next house is a large double brick dwelling;16 16. 101 East Main Street. Now the site of the Metropolitan Restaurant. in one of the stores A. Moser, boot and shoe maker, occupies, and C. H. Wingfield, confectioner, the other. John A. Marchant built this house and for several years did a mercantile business in it. In the rear there was a lager beer manufactory, but at this time it is occupied [by] B. F. Hawkins, painter and glazier. At the other end of this lot, on Market street, is the brick mansion of Wm. A. Watson,17 17. No. 100 East Market Street, now the Annex of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church. This was long the home of Mr. W. C. Payne. and adjoining it the residence of Capt. C. C. Wertenbaker.18 18. No longer standing. April 29, 1874 Main Street.—In the paper of the 15th inst. we gave account of Main street from School [East 3rd] to Green [First] streets; we will in this number begin at the corner of Green street on the south-side of Main street, with lots 37 and 38 [actually lots 39 and 40]. The large brick dwelling and store1 1. This building, with changed front, is now the Spotless Company, 100 West Main Street. The chairs on the sidewalk in front of Perley's were for long the daily gathering place of some of the older men of the town, who here re-fought the campaigns of the War between the States. now occupied by James Perley for a furniture wareroom, was for many years, one of the principal dry goods stores in the place. Mr. Isaac Raphael, we have been informed, built it, and carried on a large business up to 1836, when he removed to Louisville, Ky. He was a Hebrew, and his wife was a lady of very refined taste and culture, and one of the best performers on the piano and organ in this part of the State. Her brother, Nathaniel Wolfe, practised law here, afterwards became one of the most distinguished lawyers in Kentucky. After the removal of Mr. Raphael, the store was occupied by the late Th. J. Valentine and others. The next store was built by J. J. Fry, of Richmond, and was at first occupied by the firm of Abell, Bibb &amp; Fry, for dry goods, and afterwards by Jno. H. Bibb. The next house was built and occupied by the late Elijah Dunkum, for dry goods, and at one time, the Monticello Bank occupied it. All of the above stores are brick and have family residences over them. The next house is brick for the basement, and the upper part is wood. It formerly had a small platform in front, without the basement. Mr. Marshall, a native of Connecticut, a boot and shoe maker was its occupant; in after years Marshall &amp; Bailey (late Th. R. B.), carried on the same business here, and then Mr. Bailey himself. The late John B. Dodd, purchased the property and to the time of his death carried on the business of cabinet making. James Perley now occupies the house for his family residence, and manufactures and repairs furniture in the lower part. The next two buildings were here in 1828, the one of wood has been elevated by having a brick basement beneath it, and adjoins the two story brick house2 2. This was long kept by Mr. Jim Gleason. The brick house may be located in the illustration of early Main Street, p. 80. and store on the corner of Hill [West 2nd] street. The brick store in the lower story was once used for a blacksmith shop, and afterwards by William Summerson for a carpenter shop. Mr. S. still resides among us, verging on to his 90th year. E. M. Wolfe, afterwards had the store for many years and sold groceries and dry goods. It is now a butcher's stall. This house, we learn, was among the first brick buildings in the town. Mr. I. Raphael, previous to the erection of his store on the corner of Green [First] street kept a dry goods store here. Crossing Main St. [to north side], the lots 25 and 26, were owned by Nancy West, and a brick store and house, part of the property now owned by J. Bachrach, and a small blacksmith shop, were the only buildings standing upon them when we first knew the town. A dry goods store was kept in the brick building by Grinstead &amp; Binford, and afterwards a furniture warehouse was kept here by John B. Dodd, and also by Joseph Bishop, and while occupied by the latter, a fire destroyed the wood work, leaving the walls standing. The house and store have been remodelled. Solomon3 3. This first name should be Simon. Mr. Leterman entered business in Charlottesville about 1850, at this site, 101 West Main Street, from which his store was never moved. Later, he associated his sons with him. In 1905, following Mr. Leterman's death in 1904, the firm became the Leterman Company's Department Store and continued for about a decade. Mrs. S. Leterman was largely associated with the earlier charities of the town. With Mrs. Charles S. Venable, Miss H. Hay Watson, and others she was one of the founders of the Ladies Aid Society of Charlottesville, and one of its most active officers. It was said of her that her interests knew no difference of race, creed, or color, and in her old age she was generally called Mother Leterman by the poor of the town. With Mrs. Judge John L. Cochran, Mrs. J. Tyler Jackson, and Mrs. T. Wood she was one of the founders of the local White Ribbon Temperance Society. Leterman owns and occupies one of the stores for dry goods, and his son the other for clothing, boots, shoes, &amp;c. the next large three story building with its deep store room was built by the late Sophia Leschot, who was a partner with B. C. Flannagan and A. P. Abell, under the firm of Flannagan, Abell &amp; Co., who for many years did a very great and lucrative business in the dry goods and grocery line. The room west of this was once used by the Monticello Bank. The Brick store4 4. Now the site of Edwards' Piggly Wiggly, 119 West Main Street. and house on the corner of Hill [West 2nd] street, now occupied by Theo. Hoppe, Grocer, were built by Raphe Dudley, who sold to William Tompkins, and he sold to John C. Patterson, who built the store and house adjoining occupying the house for his residence, and the store for the sale of Dry Goods. These stores and houses are now the property of Mrs. Thompson Brown. The corner store on Hill street is at present a grocery store and occupied by Theo. Hoppe. It was on this lot Joshua Grady had, till after 1836, a blacksmith shop. On the lot, which was low, were quite a number of springs, that always kept the place wet and sluggish. On the upper end of the lot from Leterman's store and house, the Disciples' church, which separated from the Baptist, was built in 1836. Crossing Hill [W. 2nd] street [still on north side] the lots No. 27 and 28, were in earlier days almost a bog and swamp. There was a small brick house on the corner, and west of it a double one-and-half wooden tenement. They were the property of Mathew Casey, an Irishman, whose family afterwards removed to St. Louis, Missouri; one of the sons of Casey carried on the cabinet making business, and was a skillful and neat workman. The large three story house and drug store of C. P. Benson5 5. Now the site of the Safeway Grocery Company, 201 West Main Street. occupies the place of Casey's one-story brick house. C. T. Paterson, now of Memphis, Tennessee, for several years carried on the drug business and was also telegraph operator; his lady, Mrs. Lizzie Paterson, was an accomplished singer, and taught vocal and instrumental music. The next house, kept as a bakery by Voight, with modern front, is the old Casey building. The next house, brick, is a modern structure, and occupied by W. B. Franks, boot and shoemaker. The next house and store is occupied by J. W. B. McAllister, grocer, was built by J. and W. Perry, who were butchers, and afterwards kept here a grocery store; the adjacent buildings are all of recent date, and are occupied by small dealers. This lot was the western boundary of the town as laid off in 1761-'62. Crossing over Main street, on the corner of Hill [West 2nd] street, once stood a small wooden tenement, in which David Wolfe had a small grocery store, where now is the brick store and house occupied for the office of the gas company, and T. J. Williams gas fitter6 6. Now the site of Leggett's Store, 200 West Main Street. and repairer. The other brick building erected on these lots was built by the father of the late Wm. B. Thomas, and afterwards owned by John Lee, the butcher. Some thirty years ago it was set on fire, and the wooden work destroyed. Julius Munday for several years carried on the cabinet making business in this house. The two wooden buildings next were put up since 1865, one of them R. L. Dobbins occupies for shoe making, and the other by J. Smith, grocer. The next two wooden tenements were built in 1865, and the next one-and-halfstory wooden building was owned by the late Mrs. Nancy Wayman; with this lot the boundary of the old town ended at the upper end of these lots. Opposite the Methodist church,7 7. The first Methodist Church of Charlottesville has occupied three buildings. The earliest, built 1834-35, was situated on a half-acre lot bounded by Water, First, and South Streets. The second, begun in 1859, but due to war conditions not completed until 1866-67, is the one mentioned in the text. It was situated on a lot a block to the west, on the corner of West 2nd and Water Streets. Upon the erection of the third building on East Jefferson Street in 1924, the second building was converted to commercial use, and has recently been razed. on Hill street, Geo. W. Sinclair has recently erected a brick dwelling8 8. Still standing at 113 2nd Street, S. W. This was long the home of Mr. A. D. Payne. and is also constructing a wooden dwelling. Opposite the Methodist church, on the corner of Water and Hill streets, the two story brick building, painted white was built by James M. Word for the late Mrs. Nancy Price, now occupied by Mrs. Purvis.9 9. Not standing. It was replaced by the dwelling of Mr. Ben Pace. The brick residence10 10. No longer standing. The late Mrs. Emma W. Williams, a daughter of Mr. Jones, told that as a child of ten she witnessed the searching of this house by a northern soldier. Her mother was wearing beneath her skirts two bags containing silver, and she, child-like, wore in imitation two small ones holding salt-cellars and their spoons. This concealment was successful. The searcher was rough and abusive, threatened Mr. Jones's life, and caused considerable alarm until the arrival of another Union soldier who ordered him from the premises and remained in the home as protector. He advised Mr. Jones not to allow his daughters upon the streets next day, even to attend church. When the troops left, two maids belonging to this household were carried off, each behind a soldier's saddle. By the passage of cannon and other heavy transport the mud of Main Street was churned to the depth of the wagon-hubs, so that it was soon dragged into holes and high ridges which remained for many days. south of it, on the corner of Hill and South streets was also built by James M. Word, and is now owned by Jesse W. Jones. The fine and stately mansion11 11. Still standing, 200 West South Street. on South street at the head of Hill street was built by James M. Word, who resided in it for several years, now it is the property of T. J. Wertenbaker. Random Row12 12. For notes concerning Random Row, see post, pp. 93-103. commences at the end of the old town boundary, and once was a part of the farm of Joseph Bishop, who built the brick house now occupied by J. J. Utz, which house is said to be the oldest brick structure in the town; there were in 1828 several fine brick edifices in this row or street, and are standing at this day. This portion of our town was not added to the corporation till after 1835. The house on the south-side of this, (which is a continuation of Main street to the University), is the property of C. L. Fowler, and was built by Charles Spencer, afterwards occupied by a Mr. Patton; in 1836 Henry Benson had a store in this house. Charles Spencer also built the house on the street known since as the Farmer's Hotel, which his widow occupied as a house of private entertainment. Mr. Spencer, in his lifetime kept a coach or carriage for hire, and had one of his slaves to manage the business for him; Mr. Spencer suspecting that his servant did not make full and fair returns of receipts concluded to watch him; on one occasion concealing himself in the stable where the negro fellow put up his horses, he saw him take out the money for the week's work from his pocket, and placing it before him, he began to divide it as follows: One quarter for master, one quarter for me, and continued till all the quarters but one were assigned to their respective piles. The odd quarter of a dollar he decided the ownership by the following method: Throwing it up, and saying, "head for master, tail for me;" it turned up head, but the negro said that wasn't a fair throw, so again the quarter went up, head for master, tail for me, again head won, but the "nig" decided that throw to be unfair, and again it went up head for master, tail for me, this time tail won, and the quarter went into the negro's pile. May 6, 1874 Random Row, North Side.—At the foot of Random Row now West Main street, when we first recollect it, stood two small wooden buildings, the property of Joseph Bishop's heirs. It was on this lot that Gen. Parsons, of the Confederate army was born. Between the years 1830 and 1834, the present brick store and dwellings,1 1. These old buildings no longer stand. Upon the eastern end, facing Preston Avenue, was a balcony from which members of the Cox connection in 1824 waved to Lafayette upon the occasion of his historic visit. The dwelling of Dr. William Cox was one of those looted by Union troops. Mrs. Cox was shut in her room and the house sacked, the soldiers being followed by some of the rabble of the town. After the departure of the troops, Dr. Cox visited certain suspected families and recovered some of his property. (Authority: Mrs. E. H. McPherson.) with the exception of the one east, which was added to the others since Wm. Cox purchased the property, were erected by John D. Craven and Henry B. Fry, who, also owned and carried on the tannery2 2. In digging the foundations of the Super Market, 216 West Market Street, old tanning vats in good condition were unearthed which evidently were adjuncts of this tannery. James Monroe Bishop was nephew to the Joseph Bishop whose farm furnished the site for this section of the town. (Authority: Mrs. E. H. McPherson.) in the rear, where for many years the late James Bishop conducted the same business. The first store room, now occupied by A. D. Cox, grocer, was for several years occupied by Thos. Draffin, who did a large trading business in country produce brought from west of the Blue Ridge by mountain wagons, six horse teams; the animals were often decorated with ribbons, and having bells around their necks or under the bellies. We often saw the premises around the store crowded with these mountain wagons. This thriving trade after a few years came to an end, by the failure of Draffin &amp; Co. The next store, now occupied by Samuel Comer, for groceries, and dry goods, was from October 1835 to September 1844, the place where the Jeffersonian was published, established October 1835, by the present Local, and his family residence was over the office. In 1844 he built the house on the corner of Union [4th] and Main streets, where the Jeffersonian office continued till sold to its present proprietors in April, 1873, when it was removed to its present location on Union street, opposite the Post Office. The next house west to the property of William Cox, is a brick dwelling, occupied by J. A. Frazier,3 3. This old building still stands and is now occupied by the Washington Post, 239 West Main Street. tailor, and the next brick structure is occupied by Wingfield &amp; Utz,4 4. Where Witkins Furniture Store, No. 241 West Main Street, now stands, was an opening which led into a courtyard where these buildings stood. carriage makers; in the lower story are the finished vehicles, and the upper story is used for their manufacture. This building was erected by John L'Tellier. Stephen R. Sullivan and John L'Tellier, carriage makers, carried on business on this lot for many years, but their workshops were on the west side of the lot, in range with the present blacksmith shop of Wingfield &amp; Utz. The two-story brick dwelling house5 5. This white-pillared old farmhouse, which stood back in the courtyard, has been razed. Joseph Bishop purchased the farm in 1803 and died in 1825. His wife was Jane, a daughter of Edmund Terrell, and thus a descendant of Henry Willis, founder of Fredericksburg, and his wife, who was a sister of General Washington's father. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 144. with portico in the centre, is said to be the first brick building erected in the town, and was built by William Dunkum for Joseph Bishop, who owned all the land adjacent, as his farm. As Mr. Dunkum is said to have built the Wayt house, and the one occupied by Lewellen Wood on the Public Square, perhaps these houses were put up about the same time, either at the end of the last or early in this century. John L'Tellier, after the dissolution of the firm of Sullivan &amp; L'Tellier, carried on business by himself for several years. He had three sons in the Confederate army, William, a lieutenant in the 19th Va. Reg't, was killed at Gettysburg; Joseph, of the 49th Va. Reg't, was mortally wounded near Petersburg, at the close of the war, and died in that city after the surrender; Capt. John H. was also very severely wounded, but recovered; he was before the war, and is now, a very successful teacher of languages and mathematics, and resides in Texas. On the Cox lot adjoining, three persons, who were born there, a general, a captain, and a lieutenant, also lost their lives in the Confederate army. The next brick store and house, and the adjoining one, as well as the one on the opposite side of the street, were erected by George Toole,6 6. Site, 259 West Main Street. who carried on the business of tailoring on the Public Square many years, and afterwards, in connection with his nephew, Jeremiah Toole, now of Petersburg, did a grocery business in the house J. B. Andrews, grocer, now occupies. Mr. Toole in the later years did business in his dwelling, on the south side of the street. Jerry Toole was a printer, and acquired the business in the old Advocate office in this town; he was a great reader and well versed in European history, and especially of Ireland, his native land. We have often listened by the hour to hear him talk about the Irish patriots, Thomas Addis Emmett and Daniel O'Connell. Another nephew of George Toole, brought up &amp; educated by him, who was a very intelligent man, became an artist of considerable merit; some of his portraits are excellent likenesses and finished with a master hand. He was a distinguished Mason, and after his death a handsome marble obelisk was erected by our citizens over his remains, commemorating his virtues. The house next to Andrews' store, for many years was the residence of the family of George Toole, and for many years the late Mrs. C. Y. Benson resided there. The wooden tenement west, has been occupied for, perhaps, thirty years, by a colored woman, Susan Kennedy, who has sold ginger horse cakes from that time to this. The brick building now occupied and owned by F. D. Brockman,7 7. The late Mr. W. W. Waddell identified this as No. 267. was built by John Neilson, an Irishman, who with Wm. Dinsmore, were contractors in the erection of the University. Mr. Neilson resided till his death in this house. It was, when we first knew it, occupied by Fleming Boyd, of the firm of Fleming &amp; John Boyd, who did business in the store on the corner of Court and Market streets,8 8. Site now occupied by the Walker Tire Company, 501 East Market Street. recently remodelled by John McKennie. Fleming Boyd afterwards occupied the "Midway" at the head of Random Row for a public hotel; his wife died there; she is interred in the old cemetery, and an iron railing surrounds the tomb, and marble tablet. Mr. Boyd soon after removed to the West. The next house was built by Clement P. M'Kennie for his residence; he was at first editor and proprietor of the Central Gazette [18201827] the predecessor of the Virginia Advocate, edited by the late Geo. [omission] Th. W. Gilmer, Prof. J. A. G. Davis, Nicholas P. Twist [Trist] and Dr. Frank Carr. Mr. M'Kennie afterwards opened a bookstore near the University, east of the present University Bookstore, now owned by his son, Dr. Marcellus M'Kennie. The residence of Mr. M'Kennie was the one now occupied by Dr. M'Kennie. The widow of C. P. M'Kennie is still living, who has always been fond of rearing and cultivating beautiful flowers, shrubs and exotic plants, and having fine gardens; she is a noble hearted, kind, charitable and hospitable Virginia lady. Long may she live and enjoy health and the association of her descendants and friends. The M'Kennie house9 9. About No. 275. This was the birthplace of Charlie Ferguson, the great National League pitcher. Of this famous athlete, Leo Riordan, Sports Editor of the Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger, furnishes the following information. We quote: "On Feb. 8, 1925, the late Bill Shettsline, veteran Phillies official, wrote: `Ferguson was the greatest ball player who ever lived. That goes, too, despite Ty Cobb. I'll tell you why. Ferguson could play every position on the team. One year he started to pitch for us and wound up on second, playing as well as Ed Collins. As an outfielder he ranked with the very best. No better base runner ever lived. To top his wonderful performances he led our league in hitting one year.' " The Editor of The Sporting News, St. Louis, states: "Charlie Ferguson had a brief but brilliant career. He died in April, 1888, after being a member of the Philadelphia Nationals since 1883. He attended the University of Virginia in Richmond [sic] and was recognized as one of the greatest of allround players, being able to play the infield, outfield and catch. He was also the first pitcher to twirl a double header." Local tradition holds that he was the first exponent of the curved ball. on Random Row is now the property of J. M. Ferguson, the baker, who erected an addition on the east end of it, which Mr. M. Goldsmith occupied for the sale of dry goods. The wood tenement at the west end of the house is the grocery and dry goods store of G. W. Clark. The next house, brick, was built by William Garner, and since 1845 has been occupied by George Moose, for the sale of groceries and liquors. The adjoining building, now occupied by George Booth &amp; Bro., boot and shoe makers, was built by Allen Hawkins for Dr. Rice G. Bailey, who kept the Farmers' Hotel10 10. About the site of the Midway Drug Company, 297 West Main Street. There was a rival tavern or hotel across where the City Fire Department now stands on Water Street, and fracases frequently arose between the two. Under the stimulus of sufficient conviviality, one party would sally forth to "clean out" the other. The old Irish fighting song of "Vinegar Hill" would be raised and adherents would flock to both standards. Where the Lewis and Clark monument now is situated was an open space with town pump and trough which furnished the battle ground, the vanquished being finally ducked in the trough and rolled in the mud. There was a saying that the O'Tooles, the O'Tracys and the O'Donovans ruled Vinegar Hill. Where Saxton's Cleaning and Dye Works now stand, adjoining the Fire Department, was a one-story cottage with a hogshead spring and a lofty willow tree. The owner was a Mrs. Thompson, who is said to have been the widow of an English officer, one of the Barracks prisoners. At this time Water Street did not connect with Main, but ended at 2nd Street, W. The grounds of Mrs. Thompson thus extended to Vinegar Hill and the stream from her spring flowed down in the rear of Vinegar Hill's southside houses, being augmented by the overflow from several backyard pumps. Coming forward under what is now Carter's Music Store, 218 West Main, it was joined by the water from a large pump where the west wall of Sears, Roebuck and Company now stands. It then crossed Main Street as an open branch and ran down Barracks Road (now Preston Avenue) to flow into Wills's Ice Pond, which about covered the block upon which the Piedmont Candy Company, 209 Preston Avenue, now stands. This pond was chiefly fed by Schenck's Branch. It was dammed, and the outlet flowed unbridged across the Avenue and into its present channel. The ice was cut and sold for storage purposes, though not for table use. The more substantial homes all had ice-houses on the premises, and stored ice in winter, cutting from many country sources. Later, Mrs. Thompson's branch was sunk under Main Street, and covered on its further route by a plank walk. A superb sycamore tree long stood on the northeast corner of the Barracks Road and Main Street. (Authorities: Mr. Walter E. Fowler; the late Mr. W. W. Waddell.) there for several years; he sold to Peter Harman, the butcher, who also kept a hotel in it, and had a livery stable. F. M. Paoli during the war kept this as a public house. It is now owned by F. Hartnagle, as well as the next brick house, which house was erected ere 1828, and was occupied as a residence by Albert Chewning, and not as we stated last week, the one Booth &amp; Co. occupy. It was built, we learn, for Mrs. Burnley. The next stores, were, we believe, built since the war by Wesley Cox &amp; Bro., one is occupied by N. B. Lillienfeld for the sale of groceries, &amp;c. The bar room adjoining is the place of business of John Houchens. An alley way, about eight feet wide, leading to Commerce street, north, occurs here. Here properly ends Random Row, called by many "Vinegar Hill." The first name was probably obtained from the random way the houses were put up, without reference to the old town lines; at the head of the hill the street is much narrower than at its foot. Mr. J. Frank Fry tells us that the name "Vinegar Hill" was given to it on account of the illicit trade carried on in the sale of distilled liquors11 11. Error. See post, p. 110, n. 13. We are told that the older dwellers on this street insisted that the proper name was "The Hill," and considered the later name a nickname. by persons doing business as grocers; they labelled the casks containing spirits, "Vinegar." We have often heard this street called purgatory, as it was a very bad road to travel, rough, rocky and steep; accidents to carriages and vehicles often occurring. Since the street became a part of the town, the authorities have graded and macadamised it, and now it is in as good condition as the rest of our streets. The small wooden tenement west of the alley is occupied for a grocery by A. Weil, and here begins University street; between this and R. F. Harris' warehouse, for agricultural implements, are nine or ten houses, the most of them have been put up since 1828. The stuccoed building was, we are informed, put up in part, by a Mr. Huntington, a merchant who came from Connecticut, and who kept a dry goods store where R. L. Meade &amp; Co. now have a cigar and tobacco store, on the corner of Church and Main streets. This stuccoed house, William Garland once kept as a grocery and liquor store. He is said to have opened the street at the eastern end of the house to the county road, north of the present gas house. Mr. Garland removed to Mississippi, and all his family, except Dr. William P. Garland, of Jackson, Mississippi, are dead. Lewis Sowell, carriage maker, in later years owned this house, and resided here till his death, a year ago. One of his sons, Benajah, and Wm. J. Duke, teacher in the public schools in this town, reside here at this time. The handsome brick residence owned and occupied by John C. Wood,12 12. Now the home of Mrs. Virginia L. Shisler, 503 West Main Street. Mr. Wood was a northerner, but married here. He was for a while an officer in the Farmers' National Bank. with the beautiful flower garden around it, was, we learn, built by a Presbyterian clergyman, when the University was being erected, by the name of Paxton, who married a daughter of Major Garland Carr. This gentleman, in after years, travelled in the East, and published a work on Palestine. On his return he settled and became pastor of a Presbyterian church in Shelbyville, Kentucky, and afterwards resided in the State of Indiana. In our next article we shall have to commence at "Mudwall" and return to the foot of Random Row. May 13, 1874 Random Row.—The present boundary of Charlottesville, west, is on the lot of John C. Wood, where we concluded our last number. From the "Delavan" formerly "Mudwall" house to the "Midway," at our first recollections, there were no dwellings; a small brick blacksmith shop stood on the corner of the old Lynchburg road, and a few years afterwards farther west, there was put up another brick blacksmith shop, now transformed into a dwelling house. At the present day between these two points, Delavan and Midway, there are eight wood dwellings and eight brick ones. Mudwall took its name1 1. Woods, Albemarle County, p. 170, states that General John H. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia, a member of the first Board of Visitors of the University, in an effort to guard students against dissipation purchased nearly fifty acres on the south side of University Street, extending from the corner near the Dry Bridge to the Junction Depot, and built a large hotel where no liquor was allowed. He named it The Delavan after the eminent reformer of Albany, N. Y. "The hotel had a wall in front, flanked with heavy pillars, and covered with stucco stained with the tawny hue of the Albemarle clay; and from this peculiarity it acquired the popular soubriquet of Mudwall." (Philip A. Bruce, History of the University of Virginia, 1819-1919 (5 vols., New York, [1920]-22), Vol. II, pp. 328-29, confirms this.) The hotel failed, and later the building was used for a private classical school and for a Confederate Hospital. from the adobe walls that surrounded the entire lot of an acre or two, which were made of a mixture of clay, lime and straw. One of the posts of this material was standing in a good state of preservation till within a year or so past, nearly fifty years. Dr. John H. Cocke, of Fluvanna County, an associate with Mr. Jefferson, in the erection of the University of Virginia, and for many years one of the Board of Visitors of this Institution, had this building erected soon after the opening of the University, and intended it to be used for a classical boarding school, expecting to put at its head a distinguished teacher from New Jersey, but being disappointed in obtaining him, the house was vacant for a time. H. A. Garland, afterwards a distinguished man, had a very successful school here. William B. Napton, afterwards a distinguished lawyer and judge of the courts in the State of Missouri, also was principal of the classical school taught here. Dr. Charles Minor, for many years afterwards, a successful physician in this county and town, was also the principal of a large boarding school in this house, Mrs. Spencer being the matron. Dr. James L. Cabell, Professor at the University, was also, we believe engaged in this school. At the breaking out of the late war, this building was used as barracks for troops, and then as a hospital to the end of the conflict; on either side of it were erected long wooden houses for the sick and wounded. Since the war the colored Baptists, 800 of whom had been members of the old Baptist church in this town, were dismissed in 1864 to form a new church; and the church now occupies the building as their house of worship, and is known as the Delavan Baptist church. Rev. M. Lewis is at this time pastor. On the lot on the corner of the street of the old Lynchburg road, for the past twenty years or more, is the iron foundry and agricultural machine manufactory2 2. This property, long a landmark, consisted of a foundry and residence, and covered the sites now occupied by the Whiting Oil Co. and the MacGregor Motors, Inc., 416-420, West Main Street. Mr. R. Frank Harris was succeeded by his son, the late Mr. Charles P. Harris, their combined period of business covering seventy-eight years. The residence was built by Nimrod Sowell, about 1839, and purchased from John J. Pace by R. F. Harris and H. Taylor, Oct. 4, 1858. When the house was razed, it was found that the timbers were hand-hewn and the corners mortised, without the use of nails. of R. F. Harris. In good times 35 persons have been in his employ; at the present depressed state of business in the country, he has not more than half that number employed. Mr. Harris is a native of Albemarle county, and has great mechanical genius and skill, and has built up for himself and our community quite a lucrative and extensive business. His foundry turns out castings three times a week, and what any other man is capable of making or moulding, Mr. Harris can do or have done. His mowers, rakes, drills, corn shellers, ploughs and plough castings, cutters, mill machinery, cider and wine presses, harvesters, threshing machines, grain fans and innumerable others of his works are known all over the State and Southern country. We consider Mr. Harris one of our best citizens and greatest public benefactors as well as an invaluable acquisition to any country, and he should receive from our community, and especially the farming community, a steady generous and hearty support and encouragement. A few more similar establishments, and such men as R. F. Harris, would add materially to the business of the town, as well as enhance the value of the property of its owners. Support your own mechanics and they will support you. Ridge street in 1828 to 1835, was without dwellings, and scrub oaks and chincapin bushes grew, where now are to be found numerous, substantial and beautiful private residences. This street is becoming quite a prominent drive for belles and beaux, as well as for pedestrian promenades. The Zion Baptist (colored) congregation have quite a large and flourishing church on the north side of the bridge that spans the railroad track. Dr. Dice has a large and beautiful brick mansion3 3. 301 Ridge Street, now the residence of Albert S. Yancey. This was long the home of Dr. R. B. Dice, a well-known Methodist minister and editor. At the turn of the century it became for some years the home of the family of General Fitzhugh Lee. General Lee was a nephew of Robert E. Lee and had been a MajorGeneral in the Confederate army. As Consul-General at Havana he was present at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, and was given command of the Artillery forces in Cuba. He thus wore the Union blue, and threw his considerable influence toward healing the remaining scars of the War between the States. It was, however, too early for complete acceptance, and one old Confederate Colonel, standing on the curb to watch him drive by in full uniform upon the occasion of Theodore Roosevelt's address to the University Alumni in June, 1903, voiced the minority emotion by saying "he had been taught in childhood to regard heaven as the natural destination of a Virginian and had always hoped to go there, but now he felt he had rather watch the devil burn the Yankee pants off of Fitz Lee." General Lee removed to Norfolk shortly before his death in 1905. west of the bridge; this house was erected by the late Elijah Dunkum, and has been the residence of Th. J. Wertenbaker, and the late Jacob R. Stevens. The brick Methodist parsonage house4 4. 401 Ridge Street. Still used as the home of the presiding elder. is south of the above house; next is the residence5 5. 409 Ridge Street, now the home of Mr. Jury Y. Brown. of G. Wallace Spooner, for several years the property and residence of the late Reese Jurey and his family. The next fine house6 6. Now the home of W. F. Souder, 505 Ridge Street. and beautiful garden is the property of E. M. Wolfe, and was, we believe, built for and once occupied by John H. Bibb. There are a few small wood dwellings south of this house. Crossing over the street are three large brick houses,7 7. The chief of these, a four-story house no longer standing, was later known as the Barksdale place, and gave its name to Barksdale Street. The local organization of Confederate Veterans was named the Col. John B. Strange Camp in honor of this officer. built for, and occupied previous to the war, by the late Col. John B. Strange, who for many years was principal of the large and flourishing "Albemarle Military Institute." Artillery, as well as infantry, tactics were taught in it, and several of the pupils became officers in the Confederate army, some of whom lost limbs, and others were killed in the battles. Col. Strange himself, a brave and patriotic officer was killed in the battle of Antietam in Maryland. His remains now repose in the Charlottesville cemetery. It was in one8 8. 632 Ridge Street, long the home of E. F. Markwood. A glimpse of this street during Sheridan's raid is given in A. B. Warwick's Reminiscences of Charlottesville [Charlottesville, 1929?], pp. 4-5. He tells us that his family at that time were living in the house later the home of Mr. J. E. Gleason, Sr., now occupied by H. Cooper Gleason, No. 510. He recalls that many of the plunderers were foreigners, unable to speak English intelligibly. One of them said frankly, "I care not, which side wins; for I am fighting only for my bounty." When the troops departed the guard at the Warwick home and another in the neighborhood remained a day or two to protect the families from stragglers. Later, news came back that while attempting to rejoin their command they were captured and shot by the mountain population at some point between Charlottesville and Lynchburg. of the houses of this institute that the tragic death of Dr. Oliver occurred some three years since. Mr. William Darrow has a pretty residence north of the institute, which he bought of Wm. Morris, now of Mississippi. This property was at one time owned by John H. Bibb, and was built by Wm. Hodges. Mr. A. C. Brechin has, within the past two years, erected adjoining Mr. Darrow's lot, a tasteful and neat brick residence. Wm. Brown, colored, has a residence here. East of this the Lutheran church has been erected with a parsonage attached. Mr. Balz, the confectioner, has also on Ridge street, a new, fine brick residence, and the handsome cottage next, with variegated slate roof, is the property of Wm. J. Parrott. We cross over the bridge and come to the "Midway," a large, substantial and elegant three-story house, the residence of Dr. J. E. Chancellor. This house was built by Albert Chewning for the late Alexander Garrett, the former clerk of the courts in Albemarle county, and whose residence,9 9. This dwelling has been converted into a warehouse. It is on Garrett Street, facing the end of 2nd Street, E., and may be seen by looking south from Main Street. At the time of Mr. Garrett's death in 1860 it was named "Oak Hill" and was upon a farm of 117 acres, bounded by South Street, Ridge Street, and the old Farish's Mill Road (Albemarle County Deed Book 67, p. 730). Mr. Garrett came to the county from Louisa in 1794. He served as county clerk and was an active man of affairs, a large dealer in real estate, and financial adviser to Jefferson during the building of the University. He was first bursar of that institution. now the property of his grand-son-in-law, Rev. Mr. Ware, stands east of it on South street. The house was built expressly for a hotel, with the belief that Southern families having students at the University would make their Summer residences here. Fleming Boyd, Louis Xanpi, the dancing master, and John Keller for years occupied this hotel, but the travelling custom did not come up to the expectations of its owner, and it was used for a classical boarding school. Pike Powers and Alexander Duke, the sonin-law of A. Garrett, first commenced a school for boys and young men, which was quite successful, Mr. Strother having the management of the boarding department. Mr. Powers was for a session, after the death of Professor Bonnycastle, Professor of Mathematics in the University, at the end of which he settled in Staunton and had a very large and flourishing male classical academy there. Mr. Duke was afterwards associated with Charles Slaughter in the continuance of this school at Midway, Mrs. Mary Slaughter, now of Lynchburg having charge of the boarding department. Charles Slaughter shortly afterwards attended the law classes of the University, and Dr. A. R. M'Kee assisted Mr. Duke in the school until its discontinuance. Mr. Williamson had in 1850 and 1851 a school in this house. During the war the house and grounds were used for hospitals for the sick and wounded of the Confederate army. East of Midway, on Main street, was a one-and-half story brick dwelling,10 10. Replaced by Amoco Gas Station. built by the late William Booth, pump maker and occupied by his family; since his death Thomas Farrar, a colored man, also a pump maker, owns this property, and has raised and enlarged the house, and has also built the adjoining house east of it. The next house was built by Charles Spencer an Englishman, and for years his widow kept a house of private entertainment here. Mrs. S. was a lady of refined taste and education, the daughter of a surgeon of the Revolutionary Army, and she, at one time, was the owner of many sections of public lands in Ohio, which her father received for his services in the army; but, unfortunately for her and children, her husband sold them for trifling sums; the possessors of these lands realized fortunes from the sale thereof. The next house was the property of George Toole, for whom it was built; when we first knew it, in 1828, the late John Keller kept a confectionery establishment here; afterwards a Mr. Weidemyer had a store in this house. Mr. Toole himself kept store here, and died in the house. It is now a private dwelling. The next building, lately occupied by Mr. Mangum,11 11. A part of this building still stands at No. 234 West Main (now occupied by the Washington Times), and is believed to be one of the oldest remaining buildings on Main Street. The larger portion has been razed. (Authority: Mrs. E. H. McPherson.) carriage-maker, was also used for the same purpose by the late T. R. Sullivan. The late B. Ficklin once had a tobacco factory in this building, in connection with Geo. Slaughter and Mr. Goodloe, now of the Goshen Hotel. The family of Mr. Ficklin lived in the brick dwelling east of the factory. This latter house William P. Farish, William L. Dunkum, James T. Poindexter and William W. Tompkins occupied for dry goods and grocery stores. The next house, now the property of C. L. Fowler,12 12. Still owned by the third generation of this family, it is now Fowler's Valet Cleaners, 228 West Main Street. was built by Charles Spencer as we stated last week; and this brings us back to the foot of the hill, and the beginning of Random Row, or "Vinegar Hill." The latter name we have since been informed, was given to it by George Toole, and he named it in honor of the Vinegar Hill in Ireland,13 13. Vinegar Hill was near Enniscorthy, in Wexford, Ireland. It was here that the brief and desperate agrarian revolt of 1798 was crushed. The Catholic "Defenders" or "United Irishmen" in this campaign were led by Father John Murphy against the Protestant "Peep-o'-day Boys" or "Orange-men." After severe cruelties and torture on both sides the "Defender" insurgents encamped, fourteen thousand strong, on Vinegar Hill. English troops under General Lake attacked them there, June 21, and were completely successful. Father Murphy was captured in Wexford, and hanged June 26. This uprising was followed in 1800 by the Act of Union. Vinegar Hill was thus for long a "fighting word" for both Irish parties. See J. R. Green, A Short History of the English People (4 vols., New York, 1895), Vol. IV, pp. 1784-85; Sir Sidney J. M. Low and F. S. Pulling, Dictionary of English History (London, New York [etc., 1928]), p. 1078. where the O'Toole's lived, an account of which can be seen in Lever's novel of Charles O'Malley, The Irish Dragoon.</field>
