The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted primarily for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, nor the more popular and inspirational summer school, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional and life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. There were 1,144 regularly registered students in the session of 1909, besides a large number of visitors. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. LIBRARY.âIn addition to the departmental libraries the general university library is common to all departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present upwards of fifty thousand volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for eight hours daily to attend to their wants. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at the cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on some interesting topic, and a brief prayer and song service, under the leadership of some clergyman or member of the Faculty. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday Chapel service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Further advantage of holding this service at this hour is, that it enables all the Faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used in this service is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director, who will give daily systematic instruction in physical culture. No fee will be charged for these courses nor for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball grounds and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Cavern; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On all clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick astronomical observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.â The pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. Professor Paul de Launay, whose reputation is well established in this country, has been secured to give seven performances, beginning July 5th. Three outdoor performances of Shakespearean plays will be given July 22d and 23d by the Coburn Shakespeare Players, who have given their delightful performances before most of the large Universities, Country Clubs, and Summer Schools in this country. Dr. L. H. Hamner of the Russell Sage Foundation will lecture on School Playgrounds, June 28th. Other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 13th and 16th will be devoted to the problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication, improved methods of co-operation; the improvement of sanitary conditions, good roads, etc. As far as the subjects have been selected, they will be as follows: "Diseases Spread by Soil Pollution," by Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the Hook-Worm Commission; "Public School Agriculture and Farming," by Mr. Dick Crosby, of the United States Department of Agriculture; "Agriculture in the One-Teacher Rural School," by Professor B. H. Cocheron; "Profitable Farming, The Basis of Rural Progress," by Professor S. W. Fletcher, Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Other speakers will be Mr. T. O. Sandy, of Virginia; Dr. K. C. Davis, of the Rutgers Agricultural College and the University of Virginia Summer School; Miss Charlton, of the Iowa Agriculture College; and probably Professor L. H. Bailey, of Cornell University; Hon. J. D. Eggleston, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Virginia; Dr. S. A. Knapp, of the United States Agricultural Department; Dr. Ennion G. Williams, Virginia Commissioner of Health. There has been no more helpful, interesting, and vital enterprise connected with the Summer School than this conference. It is of interest not only to the students attending the Summer School, but to county superintendents, progressive farmers, and citizens' improvement leagues. The proceedings of the Conference for last year were published and distributed and proved so popular that the supply was exhausted long before the demand for copies ceased. CREDIT.âCertificates will be granted in each course in the University Department (courses outlined from page 20 to 42 inclusive) to those students who attain a grade of 75%. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No student will be allowed to take more than three courses without the permission of the Director. This regulation does not apply to the School of Methods. As a rule, students wishing University credit should not attempt more than two courses in one summer: they must receive in all cases permission to take more than three. In registering, students should state what credits they desire, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the course. After each course in this catalogue is stated its credit value in case University credit is allowed for it. Any course outlined from page 20 to page 42 inclusive, may be counted toward the Virginia Teachers' Professional Certificate. No credit is allowed either toward this certificate or toward University courses, for work done in the School of Methods, except in certain special courses where permission has been granted by the Director and Registrar; in all such cases additional work is assigned and an additional fee is charged. 1. Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to credits towards the Professional Teaching Certificate in Virginia have been passed by the Board of Examiners: "Resolved, That those teachers holding first grade or high school certificates, who attend the Summer School of the University of Virginia for two sessions of six weeks each, and who make an average of 75% on class work and examinations, in six courses, other than elementary school subjects, shall be entitled to the Professional Certificate which shall continue in vogue for seven years, subject to renewals from time to time." These six courses would necessitate the work of at least two sessions and must include at least four different subjects. The term courses as used in this paragraph refers with few exceptions to those courses outlined under the various subjects in this catalogue from page 20 to page 42. No course may be counted toward a professional certificate without the sanction of the Director or Registrar. No course may be counted toward the professional certificate unless the student has previously registered for that course and paid the fee of five dollars due for such course, receiving a card of admission signed by the Registrar and by the Bursar. 2. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In some other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. 3. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75%) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REGISTRATION.âFriday, June 17th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day. The Registrar's office will be in the southeast rooms in the Rotunda. The entire Faculty of the Summer School will be in the adjoining rooms from 8:30 to 1:30 for counsel, on June 17th. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Monday, June 27th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificate held at this place, June 28th, 29th, and 30th may enter at any time during the session. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive a card with space for name, and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be presented to the Registrar for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive a card for each course desired, each one signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, Mr. Moran, together with the fee for each course. Mr. Moran will sign and return each card to the student, who should present it to the professor of the course prescribed by the card. No student will be admitted to any course without the card of registration for that class, properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. A single registration card will admit to all the courses in the School of Methods. In the University School not more than three courses may be taken in any one summer, except by special permission of the Director. In this department each course requires a separate registration card. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. The tuition fee will consist of $5.00 for each course taken, except in the School of Methods, where a fee of $5.00 admits the applicant to all courses. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by donation that Virginia teachers shall be charged only $3.00 for the School of Methods. Further exception is made to the $5.00 fee in certain other courses where a special fee has been mentioned in connection with the outline in this catalogue. Before being enrolled in a class each student is required to register and to pay all fees. No reduction of fee will be allowed for late entrance or withdrawal. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â On Friday, June 17th, at 8 p. m. the Summer School will assemble in Cabell Hall to hear the address of welcome by Dr. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia. Recitations will begin in all courses Saturday, June 18th, at 8:30 a. m. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required textbooks and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday unless arranged for by individual instructors, except on Saturday, June 18th, and Saturday, June 25th, when classes will meet at the usual hour. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which may be allowed for transfer from one class room to another. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, July 28th, 29th and 30th, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. Individual professors, may, upon consultation with the Director change the hours scheduled, in order to avoid conflicts. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to four buildingsâ Cabell Hall, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Engineering Building, and the Rotunda. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points south and west of Virginia should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the applicant should write promptly to the Director of the Summer School. It is expected that all railways south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi rivers will co-operate in these reduced rates. All persons intending to start from points along other railways than the Southern or Chesapeake and Ohio should write to the Director for information several weeks in advance. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $3.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred and seventy-five single rooms and fifty double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $4.50 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $7.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 6th. No room will be open for occupancy before June 17th. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed-clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of an experienced matron and chaperone. Some member of the Faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought for. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, is now fully completed and equipped and is being operated successfully this session. It will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.50 a week. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee, to Mr. P. M. Chichester, University, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 51. FACULTY AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The attempt is made, and it is believed to be attended with unusual success, to procure as instructors the most able specialists in their respective subjects. Few American summer schools will show a larger percentage of men of full professorial rank in their Faculties. Especial attention is called to the strong Faculties in the standard studies usually pursued in high schools and the first few years of college instruction. The following courses are offered: Agriculture (Four Courses). Archaeology. Astronomy (Four Courses). Biology (Four Courses). Field Botany. Chemistry (Four Courses). Civil Government (Two Courses). Drawing (Seven Courses). Domestic Economy (Three Courses). Education (Ten Courses). English (Nine Courses). French (Two Courses). Games. Geography (Five Courses). German (Two Courses). Greek (Three Courses). History (Seven Courses). Latin (Seven Courses). Logic. Manual Training (Three Courses). Mathematics (Thirteen Courses). Music (Three Courses). Nature Study. Philosophy. Physics (Six Courses). Physiology. Physical Training (Two Courses). Primary School Methods (Two Courses). Psychology. School Gardening. Story Telling (Two Courses). Teachers' Training Class (Five Courses). Writing. AGRICULTURE. Professor Davis. Professor Duggar. 1. Elementary Agriculture.âThis course is intended for new students and any who attended agricultural classes in the Summer School of 1909. It will be of a very practical nature, planned to fit directly into schoolroom needs. The newest and most useful methods will be discussed. Experiments suitable for schools will be carried on in class room and garden. Lessons will be made real by objects and materials. Teaching will be done by demonstrations and experimental proofs of principles. The following topics will be treated: Corn selection; production of good seed corn; testing seeds for vitality; butt, middle and tip kernels of seed corn; conditions for germination; testing soils for acidity; soils and their characteristics; the office of root-hairs on plants; saving soil moisture; rotation of crops; study of nodules on legume roots; renovation of worn-out soils; clover and alfalfa seeds; alfalfa in the eastern states; roots of corn plants; curing clover hay; weeds and how to kill them: cotton seed and its products; use of soiling crops; catch crops and cover crops; cuttings for house plants; layering and plant division; budding peach trees; pruning a fruit tree; the home garden; the school garden. Lessons are subject to change. A simple manual will be used. Text-Book.âDuggar's Agriculture for Southern Schools. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Chemical Laboratory. 2. Elementary Agriculture.âThis course is similar to the above, with more attention given to soils and fertilizers. The subjects outlined in Course 1 will be reviewed and new work taken up daily. New students will be admitted as well as those who have studied some elementary agriculture. A simple manual will be required. Text-Book.âDuggar's Agriculture for Southern Schools. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Chemical Laboratory. 3. Advanced Agriculture.âThis course is intended for those who have completed a course in elementary agriculture in this Summer School or elsewhere, or who have completed a course in botany, biology, physics or chemistry. There will be outlines and experimental courses in the following topics: Soils and fertilizers; agricultural botany and crop production; insects and plant diseases. These subjects will be taken up in a practical way and adapted to use in upper grades and high schools. Many of the experiments will be in the garden. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Chemical Laboratory. 4. Advanced Agriculture.âThis course is offered for those wishing to fit themselves as special teachers of agriculture, and who fulfill the requirements for Course 3. The subject matter will be considered from the teacher's standpoint. There will be outlines and experimental courses in the following topics: Types and breeds of farm animals; principles of nutrition and animal feeding; common diseases of animals. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Chemical Laboratory. ASTRONOMY. Professor Simpson. Astronomy will be taught by text-book, lectures, problems, and observational exercises. A knowledge of plane trigonometry is prerequisite. Any one electing the four courses will be required to devote entire attention to the one subject. 1. Practical Astronomy.âThe topics treated will be co-ordinates of position and their transformations, astronomical instruments, the fundamental problems, observations and their correction. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Medical Building 1. 2.

Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Medical Building 1. Text-Book.âoung's General Astronomy will be used in all courses. Credit.âAny student who fulfills the conditions set forth on pages 16 and 17 and who completes successfully the four courses outlined above will be credited with Astronomy 1 B. BIOLOGY. Professor Kepner. Professor Tuttle. The summer work in Biology at present offered makes provision for the study of each of the great divisions of the organic world: separate courses being offered in Botany and in Zoology. The object in either case is, first of all, to familiarize the student with the methods involved in the systematic study of the organization of plants or of animals; and to give such opportunity for individual work by such methods on the part of each student, under the guidance of the teacher, as will enable him or her to carry on similar work elsewhere independently with confidence and accuracy. A second object of equal importance is to give the student a clear conception of the vegetable or the animal kingdom (as the case may be) as a whole, in such manner as to impart a clear idea of the relations and significance of any particular group that may be at any time the subject of special interest. These ends are sought in each case by the presentation in the laboratory of a series of representative forms, each of which is in turn made the subject of careful study as to its organization, activities, and life-history: and by accompanying lectures, in which the results of the work in the laboratory are explained and supplemented, and the relations of the organism in question to the other forms studied and discussed. Two courses will be offered in both zoology and botany, a lecture course and a laboratory course, which may be taken separately but which in each case will be more profitably taken together. The examinations at the close of the session in either botany or zoology will cover both the lectures and the laboratory work. The Biological Laboratory is admirably equipped with simple and compound microscopes, microtomes, and other appliances for cutting, staining, and mounting sections for microscopic study, etc.; and while the prime object of the courses given will be to teach students to observe accurately, to record their observations with precision, and to make correct inferences therefrom, care will be taken to make them familiar in large measure with the principles of microscopal and other biological technic. 1. Systematic Botany.âThis course is intended to afford to teachers and others an opportunity to become familiar with the forms of plant life least generally understood, or most likely to offer discouraging difficulties to the beginner who undertakes them independently and unaided. It will consist of synoptical lectures upon the vegetable kingdom and will be devoted chiefly to the study of seedless (or "flowerless") plants, supplemented by a brief study of the organization and life-history of representatives of the seed (or "flowering") plants. It should be taken in connection with the laboratory course in botany. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Structural Botany.âThis course will be a laboratory course parallel with the lecture course above outlined. The following topics will be studied: Use of the microscope and simple microscopic technic; fern-like plantsâa fern, an equisetum, a clubmoss; moss-like plantsâa liverwort, a true moss; plant-cellsâstructure, growth, modification, the methods of cell-division; algÃ¦âa representative brown alga, a red alga, green algÃ¦, especially the more abundant water forms; fungiâa mushroom, a cupfungus, the more abundant parasitic fungi, moulds and mildews, yeast; lichens; fission plantsâ the fission algÃ¦, the bacteria. Daily, from 9:30 to 12:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 3. Systematic Zoology.âThe object of this course is first, to indicate the relationships that exist between the various types that compose the animal kingdom; and second, to furnish teachers and others such a knowledge of the chief types of invertebrates and of certain types of vertebrates as is necessary to form a basis for nature study and the teaching of elementary physiology. The laboratory course in zoology should be taken in connection with this lecture course. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 4. Structural Zoology.âThis course is a laboratory course parallel with the course above outlined. The following topics will be studied: Use of the microscope and simple microscopical technic; protozoaâ amÅba, paramecium; coelenteratesâhydra and others; flatworms; threadworms, animal parasitism; annelidsâearthworm, nereis; mollusksâmussel or clam; echinodermsâstarfish, sea urchin; crustaceaâ "water fleas," shrimps, crayfish, crabs; insectsâgrasshopper, beetle, bee; vertebratesâamphioxus, dogfish, frog; fundamental tissues of animalsâthe animal cell, cell-division, maturation of the ovum, segmentation and development. Daily, from 3:30 to 6:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Credit.âA student who passes the examinations on the two courses in Botany and the two courses in Zoology (either in the same or in consecutive sessions of the Summer Session) will, on complying with the requirements for admission to the University of Virginia, be entitled to credit for Course 1 B in General Biology, or for the requirements in that subject for admission to the Department of Medicine. A student who passes the examination on the two courses in Botany will, under similar conditions, be entitled to credit for an equivalent portion of Course 1 B in Botany. Subject to the same conditions, a student who passes the examination on the two courses in Zoology only will be entitled to credit for a corresponding portion of Course 1 B in Zoology. FIELD BOTANY. Professor Lambeth. The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated would be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's Flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily excursions will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Rotunda, Room 3. Text-Book.âDana's Manual of Botany. CHEMISTRY. Professor Bird. Mr. Merz. Instruction in chemistry is offered to high school teachers and such others as are indicated below. The ample facilities of the School of Chemistry of the University are available and its laboratory and library will be used. 1. General Chemistry for High School Teachers.âThis course is designed to meet the needs of those who may have to give instruction in chemistry in high schools. A daily discussion of the elementary principles of the science will be held and simple lecture-table demonstrations made. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Bird. Wst Range Laboratory. 2. Laboratory Course for High School Teachers.âThe sole object of this course is to train each member of the class to give laboratory instruction in secondary schools; the situation that is likely to confront each one will be considered individually. The following topics will be discussed: The particular branches of the subject which should be taught high school students; the apparatus and chemicals necessary and their cost; how to equip a laboratory and how to make the best use of facilities likely to be found in a high school. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that the pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changes, especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, from 9:30 to 11:30. Professor Bird. West Range Laboratory. 3. The Principles of General Chemistry.âThis course is offered especially for those desiring University credit in general chemistry or who are preparing to enter some medical school requiring chemistry for entrance. It is essentially a quiz class and will deal mainly with the more important phenomena of inorganic chemistry and the fundamental laws of chemical science. Daily, hours to be arranged. Professor Bird and Mr. Merz. West Range Laboratory. 4. Laboratory Course.âThe facilities of the laboratory and library are offered to those who wish to do special work in general or analytical chemistry. The instruction in this course will be such as to meet the needs of the following groups of students: Those who desire experience in the analytical methods used in a particular line they may seek to enter; those who contemplate taking a civil service examination in chemistry and who wish additional laboratory instruction; those who need additional laboratory experience in order to meet the entrance requirements of professional schools; those who desire to apply for University credit. Daily, hours to be arranged. Professor Bird and Mr. Merz. West Range Laboratory. Note.âIn addition to the regular fee for Course 2 all except high school teachers will be charged a laboratory fee of three dollars, and everyone must deposit three dollars to cover breakage. Such portion as is not consumed will be refunded. In Course 4 a laboratory fee of ten dollars and a breakage deposit of five dollars will be required. Credit.âCredit for Course 1 B of the regular session in general chemistry will be given to any one who complies with the following requirements: The conditions set forth on pages 16 and 17 must be fulfilled; Courses 3 and 4 above must be completed satisfactorily and not less than one hundred and fifty hours devoted to these two courses; an examination equivalent to that of the regular session must be passed. Credit for one or two terms of chemistry 1 B outlined in the University catalogue may be attained. The entrance requirements in chemistry of the Medical School may be fulfilled. CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY. Professor Fitzhugh. Professor Montgomery. Mr. McLemore. It will be the aim of the courses in Classical Philology to open to all teachers and students the advantages of University instruction in that subject. Courses 1-4 are especially intended to illustrate the teaching of Latin in the secondary schools. Courses 5-7 are intended to open to teachers and summer students the more important fields of college Latin. The desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is specially commended to all who wish to reap the full cultural and scientific benefit of the college courses in Latin. Greece is the fountain head of European culture, and Rome its universalizer and transmitter to the modern world. The instruction will aim to exhibit these relations and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. Course 1 is preparatory. Thereafter the work is organized in all courses as follows: The Latin languageâsystematic study of Latin grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition; Latin literatureâsystematic study of the Latin authors, as nearly as possible in culture-historical sequence; Roman lifeâsystematic study of Roman culture-history in English, in conjunction with the reading of the authors. 1. Beginners' Latin.âThis course is intended for teachers in high schools and academies, for college preparation and for students of Latin at large.

English Grammar and Composition.âThis course is designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods of teaching it. An attempt will be made to suggest standards of instruction in grammar and composition. Text-Books.âMeiklejohn's English Grammar; Joyne's Studies in English Syntax. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Wauchope. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 2. Rhetoric and Composition.âThe purpose of this course will be three-fold: First, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the text-book, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools, so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage among teachers and pupils alike good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. There will be daily original exercises. Text-Books.âThomas and Howe's Composition and Rhetoric (Longman's Green and Co.) and Woodley's Handbook of Composition (Heath). Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor McBryde. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 3. English Literature.âThis course is a general survey of the history of English literature from Milton and Tennyson. Special emphasis will be laid upon the writings that are adapted to high school work and more specifically college entrance requirements. An attempt will be made to give suggestions for future work in all the periods. Text-Books.âAny edition of the classics mentioned above; any good history of English literature (preferably Pancoast's) and Manly's English Poetry. Daily, from 3:30 to 4:30. Professor Charles Alphonso Smith and Professor William Cunningham Smith. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 4. American Literature.âThis course is a study of the lives and writings of the principal authors from Washington Irving to Sidney Lanier.

Text-Books.âPancoast's Introduction to American Literature and Page's Chief American Poets (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.). Daily, from 4:30 to 5:30. Professor Charles Alphonso Smith and Professor William Cunningham Smith. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 5. Southern Literature.âThis course is intended for those who have graduated at some standard college. It will be a general survey of intellectual and social conditions in the South before and since the Civil War, as these have hindered or promoted Southern literature. Stress will be laid on the poetry of Poe and Lanier and on the fiction of the writers since the War. Students will be required to do research work in neglected fields of literary history, such as the history of Southern magazines, the development of short stories, and dialect as an element in literature. Text-Books.âTrent's Southern Writers; Baskerville's Southern Writers, Vol. 1. Daily, 10:30 to 11:30. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 6. Shakespeare.âThis course is intended for graduate students and is a short critical study of the development of Shakespeare's mind and art. Lectures will be given on the following four plays representing his work at different periods: King Henry IV, Part 1; As You Like It; Hamlet; Winter's Tale. About ten other plays will be read rapidly as parallel. Text-Book.âArden Edition of plays given above (D. C. Heath). Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Wauchope. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 7. Expression.âIn view of the larger requirements of the English course of study of today, the need of thorough training in the Art of Expression becomes a matter of vital interest to teachers of literature, for it is only through a knowledge of this art that the best results can be obtained. Two things should be required of teachers of English: That they should be free from the common faults of speech; that they should possess the power of sympathetic interpretation. To these two ends the work of this department is addressed. Instruction in Elocution is twofold in its nature; on its negative side, it aims to correct faults which would detract from an otherwise good rendition of the masterpieces of literature; while on its positive side it endeavors to bring out individual talent and to inspire such sympathy with the text as may result in a simple, natural and effective reading. Above all things, the aim of any course in public speaking should be to develop the personality of the student, not to make him a mere imitator. The hour's lesson will be divided into two parts. There will be first a lecture on some phase of the subject (with illustrative readings), which will be followed by individual and class exercises bearing upon the matter under discussion. Assignments will be made each day of selections to be studied which will be read or recited by members of the class. This will be followed by criticism from the instructor. In the course proposed it is the intention of the instructor to give the students such things as may be of practical value to them, not to burden them with mere rules and theory. It need hardly be pointed out that this course is not intended for teachers of literature only. Anyone who expects in his life work to make large use of the voice will find the course helpful. Students who intend to take the work in American and English Literature are especially urged to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by this course. The lectures will deal with such subjects as thought-reading, emphasis, breaking, articulation, phonetics, expression, reading of poetry, quality, pitch, force, time, the tunes of speech, gesture, dialogue, dramatic reading, and impersonation. Members of the class are requested to provide themselves with note-books. Text-Book.âShoemaker's Practical Elocution. The following are recommended for reference: Murdoch-Russell's Vocal Culture; Kofler's Art of Breathing; Lanier's Science of English Verse. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Reade. Rotunda, Room 4. Credit.âAny student who fulfills the conditions set forth on pages 16 and 17 and who completes successfully the first four courses in English outlined above, will be credited with Course A in English Literature in the regular session. Those who have completed the first six courses may arrange for relative credit with the professor of English at the University of Virginia. Due credit will be given to regularly registered students in the M. A. course for all plays successfully completed in class work and examination in Course 6, the Shakespeare Course. FRENCH. 1.

GEOGRAPHY. Professor Carney. Professor Scheffel. 1. Physical Geography.âRecitations from the text will be supplemented by lectures and class discussion. After a consideration of the more widely accepted theories of earth-origin, attention will be given to the planetary relations of the earth, particularly with reference to an understanding of the general circulation of the atmosphere and the consequent data of climate. Weathering, stream work, relief as influences by rock texture and structure, and their relations to man's activities, will be studied as far as possible in the local vicinity.
