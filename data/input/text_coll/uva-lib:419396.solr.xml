Murder of Mrs. Fannie McCue, Wife of Ex-Mayor McCue—Beaten with Bludgeon, Choked and Shot—Description of Wounds—The First to Arrive on Scene—A Profound Mystery—Husband Offers $1,000 Reward—Sketch of the McCue Family. On Sunday, September 4, 1904, J. Samuel McCue, for twenty years a member of the Charlottesville Bar, just retired from his third term as Mayor of that city, reputed rich man, and officer in the Presbyterian Church, arrived about 6 o'clock from Washington, where he had been for several days, on what business does not appear, although Mrs. McCue had been informed by him that he was in the National Capital taking depositions in a murder case. An hour before he reached the city Mrs. Fannie M. McCue, his wife, had come in from Red Hill, a small station on the Southern railway, some seven miles south of Charlottesville, and was at home when her husband entered the house. Without going into the parlor, where she was with a visitor, he went upstairs to the bath-room to rid himself of the stains of travel. When he met her, the manner of his greeting, and all other details of that evening until the supper hour, are lacking. The occurrences at the evening meal come into the story at a later period. The McCues were a church-going people. Deacon McCue invariably sat well to the front in the sacred auditorium, and Mrs. McCue, always looking trim, sat primly at his side. There was no lack of the conventional courtesies and observances, and few suspected a want of affectionate agreement. There was an air of dignity about the couple. On the evening in question, Mrs. McCue entered the church unaccompanied, which was an unusual thing, and went to her accustomed place. Some time later, her husband took a seat near her. When the services were at an end she left the church somewhat in advance of her husband, who paused to shake hands with one or two of the worshippers. McCue overtook his wife before she had proceeded far, and the two exchanged greetings with others as they passed along the streets. It was not long before they reached their own home, walking with Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Dinwiddie, whom they overtook, or by whom they were overtaken, and from whom they parted at the McCue gate at five minutes after 9 o'clock. Did the coming event cast a shadow over Mrs. McCue during the last evening of her life? There are some who have said as much, and many who believe that she was terribly depressed by some foreboding. On her way to church she failed to respond to a courteous salutation, evidently being too distraught to observe it, and, returning homeward, she was silent in the company of those to whom she was in the habit of conversing freely. Whatever the truth may be, husband and wife crossed the threshold of their home, and the door closed at once. Before it opened again, a tragedy had run its red course in mystery—a mystery not yet entirely cleared up. When the door closed, and all seemed dark in the McCue home, Mrs. Frank A. Massie, sitting on her porch across the street, said to her husband, "How soon they retire!" But they had not retired, and it was not long until Dr. McCue, with his emergency grip in his hand, rushed into the McCue grounds and was admitted to the house. Sometime afterwards Policeman Daniel C. Grady followed in the same hurried way, and in a few minutes a piece of news—startling, horrifying news— spread with the rapidity with which bad news alone seems to travel. As it reached the public, the intelligence was that Mrs. Fannie M. McCue had been shot to death in her bath-room by a burglar, while her husband had been murderously assaulted and left for dead on the floor of their bedroom. Crowds hurried to the McCue home to learn the worst, and how it had happened. News-gathering is an instinct. The many who could not or would not go constructed conjectural narratives of a terrible encounter, for that sort of thing is instinctive, too, giving the husband a heroic part, because he was known to be every inch a man physically, and was credited with moral courage to match his physique. When Dr. McCue, the first outsider to arrive, entered the house, he found his brother on the stairway in gauze shirt and pants, and, as the Doctor afterwards testified, in a dazed condition. The only other person in the house was John Perry, a stable boy. Sam McCue pushed his brother "in the back" and said, "Go, find Fannie." It was not a long search. She was soon found in the bath-tub, on the second floor, dead, and submerged to her neck in water drawn from the hot-water spigot, which was still turned and the water still running. The body was removed to a bed-chamber. It was now seen that, in addition to the wound from the load of shot, a huge hole in the breast, there were evidences of MRS. FANNIE CRAWFORD McCUE. three blows. One was on the right ear, made with some instrument that cut it nearly in two, and a slight one on the nose. A small transverse wound was found on the back of the head, above the mass of hair, which was up and held in place by combs. Up to this time no alarm had emanated from the McCue home. Dr. McCue said he received information from his brother by 'phone, a statement afterwards contradicted by the 'phone operators on his "board," and certainly he gave no alarm on his way to the house. The police were notified from a private residence—the only one to which Samuel McCue is admitted to have 'phoned that night. After the body of the murdered wife and mother had been removed to a bed, Policeman Grady began a search of the premises. He found no signs of a struggle in any room, and no evidence of a crime anywhere except in the bath-room. A blood-stained base-ball bat was standing in a corner of the bed-room. The shotgun—McCue's Winchester, of the "pump" style—was beside the bath-room door. It contained only an empty No. 6 shell, which Perry threw out. Steps were immediately taken to discover the assassin. The burglar and revenge theories were ascendant in the official mind. The belief in intended burglary and resulting murder soon had its run. Nothing was missing, and, besides, the method was not that of the house-breaking fraternity. Later hours and more secret ways characterize their enterprizes. It was thought, however, that there might be something in the revenge theory. Samuel McCue had been a hard man. He had sent scores to jail, and had seldom tempered justice with mercy. He had been threatened, and possibly somebody had made a bold attempt to carry his threat into execution. Telegrams were flashed about the State in a search for available bloodhounds, but without formidable results. The Baldwins, noted detectives at Roanoke and Bluefield, were summoned, and reached the city the next day. The people were indignant and public sentiment was so exigent that the City Council met and offered a reward for the detection of the criminal, although their action was without warrant of lawful authority. At a hint from some one, a few hours after the murder, Lester Marshall, a young painter, who lives near Proffiitts, north of Charlottesville, was brought under suspicion, and two persons were sent in search of him. McCue participated in encouraging a search for the burglar or avenger, and in due time the following advertisement appeared in the Daily Progress and in handbills: $1,000 REWARD.—A reward of one thousand ($1,000) dollars will be paid for the arrest and conviction of the person who made an attempt on my life, and murdered my wife at my house in Charlottesville on the night of September 4, 1904. J. SAMUEL McCUE. Much of the time that people were thronging his house on the night of the murder, McCue was lying on a sofa in his bed-room. Many sought him to learn particulars of the assault upon himself. The accounts he gave varied in important particulars, but did not contribute to a clear comprehension of any phase of the tragedy. Before the night was over, the story was a composite of McCue's narrations and of the conclusions and conjectures drawn from fragmentary data. According to McCue's statement, he and his wife had returned from church, and were preparing to retire. The gaslight in the bed-chamber was turned low, Mrs. McCue had donned her night dress, and McCue was just drawing his shirt over his head, when a man rushed in the room from the one adjoining and made for the husband, supposing that the shirt would allow him to deal a fatal blow with the base-ball bat he carried. McCue, however, had gotten the garment off sufficiently to see his assailant, and ran to a corner of the room for his shotgun. The man followed, and struck his victim a blow on the right cheek, as he turned to level the weapon, knocking him unconscious. Mrs. McCue had screamed when she saw the man, and supposing that she would arouse the neighbors before he could escape, the man seized the weapon and shot her. The wound resulting from the blow which was said to have rendered McCue unconscious was very slight—so slight as to cause comment. A little blood came from it, and there was practically no swelling or discoloration. So far as McCue's story goes, the reason for and the details of Mrs. McCue's death were all missing. That she was dead as the result of a terrible gunshot wound, was known to all who looked at her. John Perry contributed something to the story of her last moments—a contribution which more than hinted at the horrible physical and mental terror of her taking off. He was in his room— a rear one on the second floor of the McCue home, and separated by a locked door from the hall, at the end of which the bath-room is situated. He afterwards told—and then denied telling—that he heard Mrs. McCue in awful distress, begging some one not to kill her, that she was going to die anyhow—and then a shot! After that there was silence, except for the noise of some one going down stairs. Scrap by scrap the seekers after the truth pieced the story together under the guiding of reason, and it is beyond dispute that many who were that night much about the home where murder had worked its awful purpose upon a faithful wife and tender mother, saw and heard enough to make them shake their heads, if not enough to talk about except in whispers to confidants tried and found true. There was a terrible suspicion in the minds of more than one. There were questions that pressed for answers. Was Mrs. McCue in the room where her husband was assaulted, and did she receive there the injuries that showed only too plainly on her nose and ear; or did she run in terror to the bath-room, followed by the assassin? Was she shot in the bedroom and carried to the tub? If murdered in the bed-room, why was she conveyed to the bath-room at all, and how was it accomplished without blood stains on the floor? In that case, why was the gun by the bath-room door? If the assaults were the premeditated acts of a revengeful spirit, why was the more terrible vengeance wreaked upon the woman? By dawn the morning after the murder there were hundreds who took no stock in either the burglar or revenge theories. They had another theory. The McCues have always been prominent in Albemarle, exhibiting on all occasions positive and masterful dispositions in the conduct of their affairs. J. Samuel is a grandson of the late Samuel O. Moon, of Albemarle, and son of the late James C. and Sallie J. McCue, of the same county. He was reared on a farm, and engaged in assisting his father in a large farming and cattle business. He attended private school at home, later entering Pantops Academy, preparatory to an academic and law course at the University of Virginia. It is not likely that he took to books from a love of letters, but with the well-defined purpose to make use of his attainments as an asset in getting along in the world. The sparkling of the cadmean waters did not tempt him to deep and frequent draughts, and when he hung out his shingle as a young lawyer in 1884, his academic achievements and legal attainments were probably unattested by parchments. For a time he was a partner in the law business with Samuel B. Woods, the style of the firm being Woods &amp; McCue, but the connection was soon dissolved, and McCue opened an office for himself. He was diligent and successful in the special branch of practice to which he devoted himself—that of collections—and accumulated and saved with great prudence. In the meantime his reputation grew among business men, who turned over to him accounts they had failed to collect, however urgently they had sought payment, with the almost invariable result that "Sam McCue" got the money. There was growth of reputation in another way—those who were in debt soon knew him, as they said, "for an hard man." The attorney said in his own praise that his mission on earth seemed to be to make people pay their honest debts, while the impecunious debtor was haunted by a feeling of terror that was finally epitomized in the lines which are a characteristic fragment of local history— Maunfra, maunfra, what'll I do To keep out o' the hands of Sam McCue. It would be easy to tell many a story illustrative of this energy looked upon by the hard-ups as little short of diabolical. He went into politics, and in the end was successful, in spite of alleged unpopularity. His success was explained to the satisfaction of some by the belief that McCue had on file in his office claims against a large number of suffragans who were afarid to vote against him, in view of his ability to press them to extremity, and by the additional conviction that he had plenty of means to "finance" his campaigns, and was unrestrained by any hair-splitting theories on the subject. Whether or not injustice was done him, it is now too late to inquire, but there is often a flippant injustice in gossip and rumor which it is well to guard against. THE McCUE RESIDENCE. His first candidacy for Alderman was before the Council when that body was engaged in filling a vacancy from the First Ward. Another citizen—not a candidate—was elected. He was afterwards chosen by the voters and held the office six years. In 1894 he was a candidate for Mayor, but was defeated, running third in the race. He was successful two years later, and served two successive terms—1896-1900. His third term was from 1902 to 1904, closing four days before the murder of his wife. During his first and second terms the Mayor's duties included the trial of police cases, and whether his reputation was justly earned or not, many who were the recipients of his justice insisted that the quality of his mercy was badly strained. In 1900, by a charter enactment, a Police Court was constituted. Mayor McCue was a candidate for Police Justice, but after a brisk fight his brother, Edward O. McCue, defeated him decisively. J. Samuel McCue and Fannie M. Crawford were married November 4, 1885, and four children are the result of this union—J. William, Samuel, Ruby and Harry. Mrs. McCue was a daughter of the late Dr. William Crawford, of Mt. Sidney, Augusta county. Her entire married life was spent in Charlottesville, where she was recognized as a woman of fine character. The home of the McCues, on Park street, is one of the most attractive residences in this city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE FIRST SUSPECT. "Conspiracy" to Murder the Ex-Mayor and His Brother—Leslie Marshall Under Suspicion—Officers Go on Midnight Search for Murderer—Saved By An Alibi—Marshall Charges His Wife With Knowledge of Crime. The house in which J. Samuel McCue resided on the night of the tragedy is on Park Street, about half way from the court-house to the home of the late Judge William J. Robertson, and the premises adjoin on one side, "Comyn Hall," then the home of Mr. F. Berger Moran, now the residence of President E. A. Alderman of the University of Virginia, and on the other the home of the late Hon. John E. Massey, known widely as "Parson Massey." Dr. Frank C. McCue's home is on the corner of Park Street, almost facing the court-house, two squares from the residence of Samuel McCue, while Police Justice Edward O. McCue's is midway between the houses of his brothers. Before the fact that Mrs. McCue had been murdered was known to the public—indeed, but a few minutes after the shot that had put an eternal end to her piteous pleading for life—someone carrying a small grip ran down Park Street from the direction of the court-house, dashed up on the porch of E. O. McCue's residence and knocked violently on the door. Mr. Thomas F. Randolph, on his porch nearly opposite, started across the street to say to the man that he should ring the bell, when the fellow rushed away in the same manner as he had come. "I thought he wanted a warrant" said Mr. Randolph. "When he saw me he ran. He was a white man, but I do not know him." Mr. Burnley Sinclair, who lives in the next house to Mr. Edward O. McCue, was reading in an upstairs room when he heard a person run down the walk in front of his residence and up Mr. McCue's front steps. He knocked violently, awaited probably a half-minute and then ran across the grass lawn in the direction of Mr. J. Samuel McCue's residence. A few minutes later he heard of the tragedy. The few minutes which elapsed between this incident and the announcement of the crime at Sam. McCue's may have been sufficient for the accomplishment of the tragedy. Edward O. McCue was confident that the man who went on his porch desired his life and was responsible for all that occurred at his brother's. He had in mind a man whom he and his brother had caused to be punished more than once for misdemeanors, and it was understood that this man was very resentful toward them. His brother's description of the man who assaulted him fitted this one as well as any other. The scheme attributed to Leslie Marshall—for this was the name of the suspect—was wholesale. It involved the "removal," to use Guilean's euphemism, of Edward and Samuel McCue in one grand performance. Edward was to have been killed as he appeared at the door—but he foiled that part of the plan by a sort of balcony appearance at an upper window. Having dispatched the justice who had fined him for drunkenness, he was to proceed to the residence of Samuel and send to his final account the man who had had him put under bonds to be of good behavior—the man he afterwards accused of robbing him of his wife. It was suggested that Dr. McCue, on the way to his brother's, stopped to tell Edward of the gruesome occurrence, but that gentleman declared then, and afterwards swore, that he did not pause anywhere. The premises of Edward McCue were searched until a late hour, because that gentleman believed the assassin was after him too. But that was not all. Assuming that if the criminal was Marshall he had returned post-haste to his home at Earleysville, a town about ten miles from Charlottesville, Mr. Percy Payne was directed to go thither and investigate the whereabouts of the young painter at the hour of the murder. Later in the night Policeman Emmett E. Stratton was sent on the same errand, provided, perhaps, with full authority to apprehend the suspected man if he thought the developments justified it. But whatever may be said in general of the conduct of Leslie Marshall on this particular occasion he was full panoplied with innocence. That night he had gone to church with his mother at Earleysville, which was by no means usual, and returned home after the services and gone virtuously to bed. Well for him that he had an alibi so easily and perfectly established, for if he had been arrested and brought to Charlottesville charged with the murder of Mrs. McCue he would have been in grave danger, even if he had not been lynched. Such was the clue, and such the end of it as a working theory through which this murder mystery was to be cleared up. But the story of the Marshalls—for the wife. Hattie Marshall, an attractive brunette of twenty-two, becomes one of the personal dramatis—is serial, and many of its details became known after this night. The story had a brisk run in the newspapers, and may be referred to hereafter in this narrative. Lester Marshall met the insinuation of possible guilt with an intimation that the goaded accuser might well be the accused. He did not hesitate to charge that there was a conspiracy in which the wife was involved, to connect himself with the crime—and that the conspiracy antedated the murder by at least two days. A few brief sentences will give all the details necessary for a comprehension of the alleged conspiracy. In August, less than thirty days before the violent death of Mrs. McCue, Mrs. Hattie Marshall began a suit for divorce, her attorneys MRS. LESTER MARSHALL. being J. Samuel McCue and Daniel Harmon. On the second day of September, two days before the murder of Mrs. McCue, Mrs. Marshall— then in Charlottesville—wrote a long gossipy and affectionate letter to her husband in Earleysville, in which she strongly urges him to come to Charlottesville on Monday morning—the morning after the murder— to see her, for which purpose does not appear. "I wish you could arrange it so you could come to town Monday"—so her letter ran—"and I will give you money to pay your way to Proffitt's (the nearest railway station at Earleysville). If you could come early Monday morning and go back Monday eve, that would be the very thing." Further on in the letter she recurs to this request. Marshall received this letter on the 3d day of September, the day before the death of Mrs. McCue, and says he was very much surprised by it, in view of the fact that she was seeking a divorce. However, he did not go to Charlottesville on Monday, but did Tuesday. His wife received him coldly, he said, and refused to make up, and he inquired "then why did you send for me?" Her reply was that for a few hours after the murder he was under suspicion and she wanted him to come and clear himself. "How was it, then, that you wrote to me before the crime?" was his next question, the answer to which was not reported. "There is a conspiracy against me," said Marshall. "Sam. McCue cheated me out of my wife and ruined my house. Now he wants to put a rope around my neck. My wife and McCue wanted me to come back from Earleysville in time to get my head into the noose after the murder had been committed. It was a trap for me. The first thing McCue said after the murder was that I had committed it. Only a few days before the crime, his brother, Police-Justice E. O. McCue, had put me under a heavy bond for drinking and for disorderly conduct. "Sam McCue was on hand that day—the court was held in my house, too—and he urged his brother to put it to me. "Sam McCue wouldn't even let me speak to my wife on that occasion. He had long had improper relations with her. She always had plently of money and she craved fine clothes. I have heard her talk of what she would do if she were Mrs. McCue. I have heard her say she would wear different clothes from those Mrs. McCue wore—that she would travel around and have a good time instead of staying at home. We lived in one of McCue's houses for six months. He let my wife have the rent free—at least, I never gave her any money to pay it. What could I do to prevent all this? He was rich and influential, I was a poor working man. * * * "And right here," added the husband, "I want to deny another thing Hattie, my wife, said. She told you I was not making any defense to the divorce suit; that she would claim the custody of the two children. Above all things, correct this. I shall file a cross bill and will ask the court to give me the oldest child. It is mine by rights. I have no desire for the younger child. I claim no kinship to it. The woman has told me it is not mine." Marshall on this occasion certainly spoke more in anger than in sorrow, and too much reliance should not be put in his story, which his wife denies. There are some reasons for taking her statements— and she has made some very warm ones about her husband—with a proper allowance of salt. There is much uncertainty about the grain of truth in the chaff the papers have been winnowing, but there is one sure thing—if Marshall had reached Charlottesville "early Monday morning" his chances of being summarily dealt with would have been very strong. There was a popular desire for revenge just then, which might have proved deaf to explanations however reasonable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A TANGLED WEB. The Husband's Conflicting Stories—The Burglary and Revenge Theories Discredited. Suspicion Points Strongly to J. Samuel McCue as Murderer of His Wife. A coroner's jury was constituted, composed of Dr. W. D. Macon, Coroner, William H. Wood, C. W. Hulfish, Charles G. Sinclair, J. A. Gilmore, and W. G. Saltsman. Four of these gentlemen live on Park Street, almost in a stone's throw of the McCue home. The first sessions were held in secret in a room on the first floor while the victim of the murder that was being investigated lay in her casket in an upper room. Later sessions were held elsewhere, and, in response to a very strong public sentiment, the taking of testimony was done with open doors. It was while the inquest was proceeding at his home that J. Samuel McCue was called before it to tell what he knew. Previous to the meeting of the jury McCue had given several different versions of the affair to persons who had talked with him about the affair. They are interesting. Perhaps his first statement was made to his neighbor Mrs. Frank A. Massie, whose residence is across the street, and who was among the first to reach the house. "A burglar has shot and killed Fannie," he said, "and has escaped." Mrs. Massie: "What is that on your face?" referring to what she describes as "a little scraped place." McCue replied: "The rascal must have shot me, too." Mrs. Massie said McCue walked up and down the hall holding his head, and that, when his seventeen-year-old son, William, came in, he said "your mother is dead. A burglar has killed her." William became hysterical, and his father said to Mrs. Massie, "Yes, she is dead." D. C. Grady, a policeman of the city, who was possibly the first person to arrive on the scene of the murder, after Dr. F. C. McCue, testified that McCue told him some one had nearly killed him and had probably killed Fannie; complained of his head and chest hurting, and said he did not know who had done the deed. "I began a search of the house," said Grady, "I went later to the bathroom. The body of Mrs. McCue was on the rug. Mr. McCue came to the bathroom door, and Dr. McCue said, `She is dead.' " "Sam McCue said: `My God, my Maker, who could have had enough against me to do me this way and to kill my wife.' "As I entered the house Mr. McCue was standing near the 'phone. I stayed in the house until I searched it completely. I was in the room when Willie came in and his father told him his mother was dead. Both cried a great deal. "The accused said he was undressing when he heard a rattling and looked around. He saw a dirty, greasy man as if a railroad man. He reached for his gun, but the man got hold of him before he got the gun or got it in position. They had a tussle before he (McCue) was knocked out. "Mr. McCue said his wife was in the room when the man came in." Judge R. T. W. Duke saw the husband a short time after the death of Mrs. McCue; probably only a few minutes had elapsed. The Judge told of the interview: "I reside diagonally across the street from the residence of Mr. McCue. I had gone to my brother's house in the country that afternoon and arrived home about 9 o'clock at night. Soon after reaching home, I went to my library and read about five minutes when the 'phone rang and I heard of the tragedy. "I grabbed my pistol and ran to the McCue house, rushed up stairs into a room and saw Mr. McCue lying on the sofa. Willie was kneeling by him and was very hysterical. "I asked Mr. McCue what had happened. He said he and his wife had been to church and incidentally referred to the sermon. On arriving home he said he heard a noise in the hall and went out and grappled with a man. He broke away from the man and went and got his gun. As he returned with the gun the man knocked him down and got the gun. I advised that Mr. McCue take some morphia. He emphatically refused to take it and told us to go and look after his poor wife. I went to see his wife and found her body on the bed. One glance was sufficient. "I then returned to where Mr. McCue was. He was lying on a sofa. He rolled off the sofa and as he did so, I noticed blood on the sleeve of his undershirt. I got to the house between 9:30 and 10 o'clock. Mr. McCue was perfectly rational. His pulse was beating rapidly, but he was rational. He was not as excited as I was. He was not very excited. "I was very much surprised that Mr. McCue should have referred to a portion of Dr. G. L. Petrie's sermon that night." Mr. Marshall Dinwiddie, who lives on Park Street, a little farther out than Judge Duke, reached the McCue house at 11:30—about two hours after the murder—accompanied by Mrs. Dinwiddie. Samuel McCue was, according to the Dinwiddie's statement, lying on a sofa suffering from a lick on the head. He said some one had come into his room, knocked him senseless, and shot his wife. He said he was in front of a chiffonier and his wife near a bureau; that he tried to get his gun out of the case, when the man knocked him senseless and took the gun. To Mr. George L. Mason he gave another account. "When I was talking with Mr. McCue," said Mr. Mason, "he told me that his wife was prepared for bed, and he had on his under shirt. The lights were turned low and he heard a sound like a click, and turned and saw a man; he went to his chiffonier where he kept his pistol, the same place where he kept his collars and cuffs. His pistol had been removed. Then he reached for the gun which was in the corner. When he got the gun he was struck with a bat or some object, and he knew nothing after that." Mr. F. Berger Moran was his nearest neighbor—a narrow alley separating their premises. He had known McCue for twenty years, and when he was told something had happened at his home, he went over at once. "I asked him how it had occurred," said Mr. Moran. "He was lying on a sofa and said he did not wish to be disturbed. He was morose and in a bad humor." The following morning Mr. George Perkins, City Counsel and a distinguished member of the Charlottesville bar, called to see McCue. Mr. Mason, whose story of his interview with Mr. McCue has been given, was present, and from his report of what took place—a report made on oath—McCue told Mr. Perkins little more than he communicated to Mr. Moran. "Mr. Perkins asked him about the thing," said Mr. Mason, "and shook hands with him. He asked him if he knew much about it, and he did not seem to know much. He asked him if he was struck with a bat, and he said he did not know, he could not remember. He then asked him if he was struck with a gun, he said he could not remember." McCue was more communicative later, when talking to William Hurley, a colored man whom he had frequently employed to care for his stock. "I saw Mr. McCue in the afternoon," said the witness. "He said some one had come in his house and killed his wife, and nearly killed him. He said he saw a man in the mirror as he (McCue) was standing in front taking the buttons out of his shirt—that his wife was then in the bath-room. He then went and got his gun, put two shells in it and started to the door; when he got to the door he was struck and knocked senseless. The man was a dirty, greasy looking white man, he said." It will be interesting to compare these statements with the history McCue gave the coroner's jury of what took place between the closing of his door as he and his wife crossed the threshold of their home, after they had been to church, and the arrival of his brother, Dr. Frank C. McCue. This was the only statement made by McCue under oath, as he did not go on the stand in the trial: "Mrs. McCue and I went to the Presbyterian Church last night; got out about 9 o'clock, I suppose. We came on back and walked along with several people. We saw Uncle Marshall Dinwiddie standing a short distance beyond our front gate and I remember he stopped near our gate or a little beyond it. "I asked him to come in, and he said he would have to go on, that his wife was not well, I think. We came on up; I think I found the front door unlocked. When we went to church we left William here; he was reading at the bureau. I asked him if he did not want to go to church. He said that he was going to pay a call. He said when he left he would turn down the gas. It was turned down when we came back. "I picked up a paper, reading the last Council proceedings, and I think Mrs. McCue was undressing in the meantime, and talking about the affair. She laid her clothes on a chair. I had gone over to my chiffonier and took my coat off and my collar and my negligee shirt. "I was standing at my buffet and I noticed some figure moving toward me, I think I rushed over towards the gun which stands in the corner— we keep it there—and that is about all I remember. I think I must have been unconscious after that. He and I had a scuffle. I am pretty positive he was a white man, a kind of dirty white man. I think his beard was out a little." In answer to questions Mr. McCue said: "He probably had a mustache. My recollection is that his clothes were rather of a dark hue. I could not say which door he came through for my back must have been to the door. It seems to me I heard a sound, when he came in, some sound of a click like. I do not know how long after this sound before he came in. Do not know if he had anything in his hand but possibly he did. I am sure the base-ball bat was not in the room when I left for church." Q. When you last remember what was Mrs. McCue doing? A. She was over here at the bureau, and I was undressing at my chiffonier. Q. Was she standing or sitting down when the man came in? A. I could not say. Q. You don't remember when she was attacked? A. No; I must have been unconscious. Q. When you came too, what did you do? A. I looked around and I could not see good, I was dazed; everything misty before me; I do not know how I got down stairs; whether I walked or fell down the stairs, I don't know which, and I think I called Frank the first thing; called him up over the 'phone. I did not see Fannie. Afterwards I 'phoned for Mr. T. J. Williams, Miss Lacy Williams and her mother, and told them to come down here; that some one had knocked me down and probably killed Mrs. McCue. I did not see her (Fannie) anywhere. It looked smoky in the hall. Then I went and called the boy, John Perry. The public was watching developments, taking note of these variations in McCue's narratives, and growing more and more restless at the deliberate methods—very proper ones though they were—which characterized the investigation of the coroner's jury. The doctors had been busy studying the wounds on the body of the little woman who lay dead in the McCue home, and it was not long before the people in the street knew that the mute lips of these traces of a brutal frenzy were accusing somebody of heinous things. Dr. Charles S. Venable made a complete examination of the body in company with Dr. J. E. Early, in the presence of Dr. McCue. He described the gunshot wound which entered slightly to the left of the collar bone and ranged downward to the right, fracturing the fourth, fifth and sixth ribs, some of the shot penetrating the backbone. There were five distinct prints of fingers on the throat of the deceased—one on one side and four on the other—as if she had been choked with the left hand. I noticed also that a nail on one of the fingers of the deceased was bent back and broken. (Evidently the poor woman had desperately clutched the assailant when he was choking her to death!) Above the hole made by the shot, the gown was torn and the lace around the neck was torn nearly off. The body of the ear was cut in two, and there was much discoloration. The nose wound bled, but no bones were broken. The wound at the back of her head was slight and may have been produced after death, when she fell or was thrown into the bath tub. Dr. Early's statement was of facts identical with the information given by Dr. Venable. These gentlemen and Dr. Hugh T. Nelson concurred in saying that the wounds on the person of Samuel McCue were insignificant and resulted from blows that would not produce unconsciousness. "When I first saw McCue on the floor I saw no wound on him," Dr. Early said. "Later I saw a slight abrasion on the right cheek bone and he was wiping it with a handkerchief. I examined it the next day. It was just as if some one had fallen and skinned his knee on a rock. I examined his head and found no evidence of injury whatever. This was Monday. There was comparatively no swelling." Suspicion once aroused, even trifles bore terrible significance. It was inevitable, therefore, that the cruel handling to which Mrs. McCue had been subjected before she was shot to death, taken into consideration with the wounds sustained by her husband—wounds which three out of four physicians pronounced slight and trifling—should have produced a profound impression and one strongly adverse to belief in either the theory of burglary with resulting murder or murder in revenge. A strange feature in the behavior of J. Samuel McCue on that night was noted. It will be remembered that when his son, William McCue, entered the hall-way, Samuel McCue said to him in the presence of Mrs. Massie, "Your mother is dead. A burglar has killed her." And turning to Mrs. Massie he repeated, "Yes, she is dead." This was but a few minutes after the enactment of the tragedy. Later in the night, when Dr. Venable was with him, he asked the doctor if she was dead and Dr. McCue in a whisper said, "Yes, Sam, she is dead." The husband said, "Oh, my God," without the slightest change of expression, according to Dr. Venable, indicating no grief, excitement or surprise. There was no tremor of his hand. This was the second time Dr. McCue had told his brother his wife was dead! Immediately after this gentleman had reached the bathroom and found the body, "Sam McCue," according to his testimony, "came to the bath-room door and asked if she was dead, and when I told him that she was he said "My God, my darling wife." More than one of those who took note of things at the McCue house that night went home putting this story and that, this circumstance and another together, and drawing their own conclusions. Public feeling was constantly growing more and more hostile to the husband, and the investigation of the coroner's jury proceeded with a deliberation that exasperated a great many who were not charged with the grave responsibility imposed upon the excellent gentlemen of that body. Responsibility is sobering to good men, and the conservative behavior of the jury merits commendation. There was talk of popular discontent going to violent lengths, but on Monday evening the jury adjourned until Wednesday to give way to the funeral on Tuesday. It was said this action was taken at the request of the detectives. The funeral services took place at the Presbyterian Church, in which, some forty hours before, the victim had sat, for the last time, under the ministrations of her pastor. The pavements around the sacred edifice were covered with a quiet gathering of the people who were holding their indignation with a tight rein and awaiting developments. The husband was the chief mourner and he and his children and the several members of the Crawford family who were present, together with family connections, descended from their carriages under the scruitiny of many hundreds of eyes, all, or nearly all, casting suspicious glances when they arrested on J. Samuel McCue. He had in his hand the handkerchief that was an ever-present feature of his long and trying days in court, and frequently pressed it to his right cheek, where appeared a small discolored spot, outlining the wound resulting from the blow which he claimed knocked him insensible. The church was crowded, and the attendance overflowed into the Sunday School room. The services were conducted by the Rev. Dr. George L. Petrie, and were extremely impressive. It was a time of tense feeling. The husband wept convulsively, and others more quietly. The interment was in Riverview Cemetery. The pall bearers were: Daniel Harmon, George Perkins, Judge J. M. White, James B. Wood, T. J. Williams, Captain Micajah Woods, George Mason and Charles H. Moore. Among the relatives of the two families from a distance who attended the funeral of Mrs. McCue were her brothers—William C., of Fort Worth, Tex.; Dr. Frank, of Mount Sidney, Va.; Ernest B., an attorney-atlaw, Harrisonburg, Va.; James, of Mount Sidney, Va.; and Edgar Crawford, of Covington, Va.; and two sisters—Mrs. Sallie Grisby, of Atlanta, Ga., and Miss Bertie Crawford, of Mount Sidney, Va., and the following brothers of Mr. McCue: John L., of Richmond, Va.; Charles, of Greenwood, and William, of Greenwood, Va. During the funeral the detectives were busy—at the McCue residence. J. SAMUEL McCue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. ARRESTED AND ARRAIGNED. J. Samuel McCue Charged with the Crime—His Arrest Follows—Verdicts of Coroner's Inquest and Grand Jury—First Appearance in Court—Jury Obtained from Petersburg, Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Warrenton—Pathetic Incidents. J. Samuel McCue was arrested at 5:20 P. M. Wednesday, September 7th, on a warrant charging that he "did wilfully, deliberately and premeditately kill and murder Fannie C. McCue, his wife, in violation of a statute of Virginia." The arrest was made by officers Dan C. Grady and A. N. Eubank. These officers served the warrant sworn out by Commonwealth's Attorney Frank Gilmer, and issued by Acting Police Justice Archibald D. Dabney, who was sworn in by Police Justice Edward O. McCue, who naturally desired to avoid the performance of the unpleasant duty of issuing a writ for the arrest of his own brother. At the time of the arrest the Coroner's inquest was proceeding in the Council Chamber at the City Hall, and an impatient crowd was gathered there. There was no expectation of an arrest before the jury's verdict was rendered, and McCue was in jail some time before the news spread over the city. The occurrence was not a surprise to the public, for suspicion pointed to McCue so positively that the wonder was that he escaped arrest so long. The truth is, he was practically, if unconsciously, under restraint for twenty-four hours before Officers Eubank and Grady took him into custody. McCue was in his bedchamber—the room in which the tragedy occurred. Officers Grady and Eubank entered the room unaccompanied. Mr. Grady handed the innocently-looking paper to the accused without a word. McCue read the warrant calmly. He then turned to the officers and said: "Do your duty, gentlemen; I do not blame you." Officer Grady then advanced to him and said: "I must search you, sir." "Of course," he answered, and extended his arms and permitted the officer to make an examination. No weapon was found on his person. The accused then said: "By the grace of God I will come out all right. Do your duty, gentlemen." McCue descended the steps to the sitting room on the second floor and said to his children, who were grouped in that room: "Do not be uneasy. I am not afraid of the consequences if I get justice. I have committed no crime." When he kissed his four little ones good-bye, he cried with them in a frenzy of grief. McCue stepped into a carriage with Alderman A. D. Payne. He was also accompanied by his brothers and C. H. Moore in another carriage, the police officers walking on the pavement opposite the accused. McCue was driven to the city jail, to whose cells he had committed many prisoners during his service as Police Justice. Few knew of the arrest, but the procession attracted the attention of the loiterers on the streets, and by the time it reached the jail a small crowd was following the carriages. The prisoner paid no attention to the small crowd that had assembled at the jail entrance. When Deputy Jailer Nat. Martin opened the great gates the accused entered and the police dispersed the idlers. The arrest of McCue was followed by preparations for his protection, and even by suggestions to remove him to another city, not that there were any very significant evidences of a purpose to resort to mob methods, but out of abundant caution. The absence of the Monticello Guard, which was at the Manassas encampment, was looked upon as a possible encouragement to the lawless, but a guard of twenty-five men was placed within the jail inclosure with instructions to shoot to kill if any attempt at violence was made. These men were under City Sergeant C. W. Rogers. Governor Montague kept in touch with the situation. For probably as much as a week after the arrest there was talk of lynching. At one time it was said many men gathered in the neighborhood of the Monticello Wine Company's cellar, on the northern boundary of Charlottesville, some three hundred yards from the home of the accused, and about the same distance from the jail in which he was confined. Nothing was done, it was said, because there was no one willing to lead—and well it was so, for the people of the town were opposed to any unlawful acts, and their sentiment was behind the orders given the guards at the jail not to trifle with lynchers, but to use their muskets with effect. On one occasion the streets were suspiciously full of people to a late hour of the evening, and there were incendiary remarks by some who realized quite well the seriousness of doing more than talk, but the sturdy common sense of the people prevented any foolishness. The newspapers kept the public informed of the movements of the accused, his attorneys, the detectives, and all others who afforded interesting copy. Thus it was known that McCue was comfortable in his cell; that he enjoyed fare from his own table; that curtains screened him from the scrutiny of other prisoners; that he had a Bible on his table and his wife's picture above it; that he had expressed poignant grief and a willingness to give every cent he possessed to know his wife was alive or had died a natural death, and a hundred other things, the publication of which was demanded by the curiosity and craving of the people who buy and read newspapers. In due season the coroner's jury returned a verdict charging the prisoner with the murder of his wife, and then there was a quieting down of the excited feeling which had given some occasion for uneasiness. Many regarded the accused as doomed from that day, feeling confident that if his neighbors who conducted the inquest were convinced, after slow and deliberate gathering and weighing of the evidence, there could be no reasonable doubt of his guilt. The Corporation Court for September convened, and McCue was duly indicted. The members of the jury were James F. Harlan (foreman), Colonel T. S. Keller, M. C. Thomas, Henry M. Gleason, B. F. Dickerson, H. L. Lyman, Adolph Russow, G. B. Goodyear and W. T. Martin. On the 20th of September the prisoner was brought into court to be arraigned. It was his first appearance after his arrest on the 7th. If any one looked for a defiant man, the spectacle was not realized. The ex-Mayor entered in the custody of his jailers, and walked to a seat at the bar, into which he sank, having cast but a fleeting glance at the hundreds who crowded the room and fixed their gaze on him in absolute silence. The ordeal was terrible, and the unhappy man buried his face in his handkerchief and gave way to weeping that was piteous to see. His brother, Edward O. McCue, sat silently by his side, his young son, J. Samuel McCue, stood outside the railing near a post in the crowd, and the counsel for the defense, Messrs. Daniel Harmon, John L. Lee and G. B. Sinclair, were ranged in front at the trial table. Next to them sat the two prosecuting attorneys, Frank Gilmer and Richard S. Ker. For a few minutes there was no sound in the court room except the audible sobbing of McCue, and every eye in the building witnessed his complete surrender to his emotions. Commonwealth's Attorney Frank Gilmer rose and requested that McCue be arraigned, stating that he hoped a speedy date would be set for the trial, as the Commonwealth was now ready to go on with the case. There was an interval of waiting during which the counsel for the defense consulted over a typewritten document produced by Mr. Harmon. After a few minutes of discussion, McCue was touched on the arm by Mr. Lee. He at once took his handkerchief from his face, pulled forward his chair, and in a business-like way began an examination of the paper. After carefully reading it over and exchanging a few words with his lawyers, McCue, with perfect coolness and a firm hand, signed his name to the document. The paper was a plea to quash the indictment of the grand jury against McCue on the ground that Mr. Henry L. Lyman, one of its members, was not a bona fide resident of the city. Mr. Gilmer at once objected, and moved that the paper be excluded. Mr. Harmon asked for a jury to try the question of fact as to whether Mr. Lyman was a citizen of Charlottesville, and the court took the motion under advisement until 10 o'clock the following morning. The motion was granted and the case submitted to a jury consisting of Oscar Hawkins (foreman), L. A. King, J. J. Leterman, S. F. Florence, E. F. Markwood, E. T. Jessup, W. T. Tyson, Jr., Mayanadier Mason, Quintus Tinder, M. E. Norris, and J. P. Ellington. The room was crowded, as on the two preceding days, and the utmost interest was manifested in the proceedings. McCue came in attended by his jailers and took his customary seat near his counsel, with his brother, Edward O. McCue, at his side. The decision of the jury was that Mr. Lyman was eligible, and court adjourned to the following Monday, September 26th. On that day Captain Micajah Woods made his first appearance in the case. When McCue engaged as his counsel Daniel Harmon and Walker &amp; Sinclair, of Charlottesville, and John L. Lee, of Lynchburg, it was conceded that he had as strong an array of legal defense as it was possible to bring together in Virginia. The Crawford family had employed Captain Richard S. Ker, of Staunton, to aid Commonwealth's Attorney Frank Gilmer, upon whom had devolved the difficult undertaking of collecting evidence and shaping the prosecution. With all his energy, skill and experience to aid him, the task was too much for Mr. Gilmer, or any one man. That he did his share with conspicuous fidelity, everybody knows, and he came out of the case with augmented reputation. That Captain Woods was asked to take up this disagreeable position and duty, is no reflection on the Commonwealth's Attorney; nor was there any reflection on Captain Ker, one of the brightest lawyers of Virginia. Captain Ker's recognized ability was fully sustained in his able conduct of the case against Kennedy and his associates for train-wrecking and murder in Augusta county some few months ago. He is held in high respect by the State attorneys, and will add to his high record in the present case. But with Captain Ker at Mr. Gilmer's side, it was still two to one. This the people of Charlottesville felt was not quite right, and they brought to bear upon Captain Micajah Woods, the distinguished Charlottesville lawyer (thirty years Commonwealth's Attorney of Albemarle county), who had already refused to enter the case for a fee, a pressure which has, probably, no parallel in the legal history of the State. The following petition, signed by hundreds representing all walks of life, was presented to him: "We, the undersigned citizens of Charlottesville, believing that the good name of our city and State may be compromised if the Commonwealth's Attorney is left without adequate aid in the prosecution of the person responsible for the recent terrible crime, appeal to you to afford to law and order the support of your talent, learning and experience. We believe that your entrance upon the case will afford a measure of security against popular resentment." After a careful investigation of the evidence against the accused, which convinced him of his guilty connection with the death of his wife, Captain Woods responded to the popular wish in the following card, printed in the Charlottesville Daily Progress, September 26th: "In response to petitions signed by nearly a thousand citizens of the city of Charlottesville, and the county of Albemarle, and in deference to appeals made to me personally by scores of men and women of the community, I have decided to aid Mr. Gilmer and Mr. Ker in the management of the case of the Commonwealth vs. McCue. "No one would be more delighted than I to see the defendant in this case honorably relieved and cleared of the terrible crime with which he is charged, and I assume this responsibility with the sole purpose of seeking fearlessly for the truth, regardless of the personal inconvenience and sacrifice which will result to me, and in spite of the very disagreeable duties which will devolve upon me. "The brutal murderer of Mrs. McCue, whoever he may be, deserves no sympathy, and should be executed under the law. I think the case could be safely left in the hands of the able attorneys who represent the Commonwealth, yet I feel it to be my duty to a people who have honored and trusted me since my youth, to yield to their solicitations, and to do all I can to see that the ends of justice are reached and that the majesty of the law may be maintained." At 10 o'clock, on the morning of September 26th, when hundreds of spectators crowded the ancient court-room, from whose walls looked down the portraits of dead legal celebrities, Commonwealth's Atu ney Gilmer arose and said: "If your Honor please, I now ask that the prisoner be arraigned." McCue arose, and with head bowed and handkerchief held to his face, heard the indictment read without visible emotion. Not once during the reading of the paper which accused him of the murder of his wife, did he raise his eyes from the floor. He stood with his right arm across his breast, his left hand and the handkerchief it held ranging back and forth between chin and eyes. At the conclusion of the reading, McCue looked up at Clerk Duke, and in a quiet tone said, "Not guilty." The reply to the question of the court, "How will you be tried?" was in such a subdued voice as not to be heard beyond the narrow circle of those within the railing. After the arraignment and pleading of the accused, Mr. Harmon, for the defense, arose and addressed the court. He denied that it was the purpose of McCue or his attorneys to delay the trial one day beyond the time when an impartial jury could be obtained. He was very hopeful of the result, provided such a jury could be obtained. He had intended to ask for a change of venue, but upon consultation with the counsel for the Commonwealth, had decided to ask only that a jury be summoned from a remote part of the State. Repeating that he desired a speedy trial by an impartial jury, he asked that the trial be set for the second day of the next term of court. The lawyers for the Commonwealth concurred in this request, and his Honor very promptly ordered a continuance until Tuesday, October 18th. Judge Morris directed City Sergeant C. W. Rogers to summon from Petersburg a venire of fifty men. When court convened on the 18th of October, the veniremen from Petersburg were present. So, too, was the prisoner, attired neatly, as has always been his wont, and apparently pleased to have his children about him. His only daughter, Ruby, probably thirteen, nestled in his lap and wept. Seven jurors were selected from the talismen present. Sergeant Rogers was sent to Richmond, and out of the twoscore and more rounded up there, one eventually sat on the jury. Fredericksburg, where the third draught was made, yielded two, and Warrenton two. The following is a list of the jury, as finally empanelled and sworn, and their occupations: Shelton Chieves, Petersburg; peanut factory. James B. Prentis, Petersburg; manager tobacco factory. John Y. Stockdell, Petersburg; hardware merchant. A. S. Johnson, Petersburg; merchant. A. J. Saunders, Petersburg; merchant. W. B. Spiers, Petersburg; engineman. T. F. Parsons, Petersburg; wholesale feed dealer. W. G. Fewell, Warrenton; book-keeper. L. E. Holmes, Warrenton; farmer. Nelson C. Decker, Fredericksburg; agricultural implements. S. B. Quinn, Fredericksburg; book-keeper. John A. Traylor, Richmond, not in business now. Soon after the jury was completed it looked very much as if there would be a delay, due to the fact that Daniel Harmon, the leading counsel for the defense, was found to be too unwell to engage in the trial at the time, or for at least thirty days. Mr. Lee, his colleague, said that all of them depended much upon Mr. Harmon for both law and fact, as much had been left to him, and he had done a great deal of work. The prisoner, he said, was anxious to get the trial behind him, and the lawyers had business reasons for desiring a speedy termination, but they felt that they should ask for a postponement. The matter was not concluded when court adjourned for the day. On reassembling Mr. Lee withdrew his motion for a continuance, as it was definitely decided by Mr. Harmon's physician that he could not go into the case now, or at any time in the near future. In his place Mr. J. Tinsley Coleman, of Lynchburg, had been engaged. The trial had now in its progress reached the point desired by the eager visitors to the court-room. There had not been lack of spectacular circumstances. The tears of the accused man, the pathetic hovering near him of little Ruby, the worst bereaved of the four motherless children, had touched the hearts of all who saw, and men and women, whatever they may say, find a kind of pleasure in pathos. To the ladies in the galleries there had been a novelty in their first view of the court of justice in the transaction of its solemn business; something piquant in the occasional evidences of the survival of obsolete poems, as in the sing song "Oh yes, oh yes." (The hardly recognizable oh yez, coming down from the days of the Normans in England) with which the tipstaff of the court, Mr. Rogers, opened the proceedings of each session. But this had been going on for some time, and the spectators who hustled each other in the crowded court-room wanted a change of program. There was a story to be told to the jurors by half a hundred witnesses, and they wanted to hear it. They anticipated tilts between the lawyers, and they expected these would be worth while, since the gentlemen were giants in their fields. A new thing under the sun in Charlottesville was the crowding of ladies of the best classes of society into the stuffy, dusty galleries of the old court-house, which, built by Virginians of the olden day, was not made for ladies. True, guided by Judge Morris, wise and skilful jurist as he is, there was little if any danger that anything would occur to offend even the most sensitive of our good women.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. BEGINNING OF EVIDENCE. A Brother's Testimony. The Physicians on the Stand—Was McCue Insensible? Hears That Wife Was Dead Without Emotion, Says Dr. C. S. Venable. The Bloody Undershirt. Dr. Frank C. McCue, the prisoner's brother, was the first witness put on the stand by the prosecution. Like most of the McCues he is a handsome man. There is nothing sinister or unpleasant in his face; his manners are quiet as become a gentleman, and he is much liked by all who know him. He is thirty-one years old, and his residence is less than three squares from the house in which the crime was committed. The first information he had of the murder was about 9:15 o'clock, September 4th. His wife and he had retired, when the 'phone bell rang. Sam McCue said over the wire: "Come down here. Some one has knocked me senseless and I think has murdered Fannie." Witness got his pistol and his emergency grip. He went down Park Street and went into Sam McCue's house, where he first saw the negro Perry and the ex-mayor. Lights in the house were dim. The accused had on trousers and undershirt and his cheek was bleeding. He appeared dazed and could not give a good account of himself. He said: "Go on and hunt for Fannie." Witness smelt the odor of powder and heard water running in the bath-room. Thither he went and struck a light. Then he saw the corpse of Fannie McCue lying in the tub with the water running. Water was running so her gown was floating above her knees. She was pulseless, her mouth partly open. Some one asked if she was dead. Sam did the same thing. I said, "Yes." Then my brother said, "Oh, my God; my darling wife!" The picture thus drawn by Dr. McCue of the terrible scene in the bath-room so moved the prisoner that he wept convulsively for a time. Dr. McCue continued his evidence, describing the wounds and telling of finding a window open in the room behind McCue's bed-room. The parlor window was also open. Meanwhile several others including a policeman, had arrived. Not until Mrs. McCue was laid on the bed did Dr. McCue observe the gunshot wound. John Perry told him the gun found was McCue's. The water running into the tub was warm. Sam McCue seemed to be suffering greatly and the wound on his face was bleeding. "When I went in the room, once or twice I heard some one say, `What's that'; then I observed the discolored bat." Mrs. McCue was between 45 and 48 years old. (She was 42.) She had four children. Her weight was from 100 to 110 pounds. Her body was warm when it was found. Mrs. McCue's head, said witness, was above the water, which was up to her shoulders. There was no flow of blood from the gunshot wound and no discoloration from blood. The gown was also free of blood. There was no manifestation of hemorrhage, no blood on the outside; merely a little discoloration on the gown where the load entered. The witness said Drs. Early and Venable made the examination, and also searched portions of the house. "I was merely a spectator," said he, "though I held a light for the examiners. Nothing was done with the body until they came." "When you found the gun and asked whose gun was it, where was the accused?" "I couldn't say. I think he was in his room." In answer to a question, witness said: "Just before we removed the body from the bath-room, he (Sam) came into the room." "But at the inquest you said he didn't go into the bath-room," remarked Captain Woods. "At that time it didn't come to my mind," explained the witness. The witness was shown the base-ball bat found in the house. When he first saw it Sam was lying down and the bat was leaning up against the fireplace at the head of the sofa. "Some one said, `What's that bat doing there?" I observed some discoloration near the end of the bat. The bat was handed at once to some one representing the Commonwealth. I think it was Cliff Rogers. "When I first saw the gun I observed it to the right of the hall door leading into the bath-room. The colored boy, John Perry, jerked back the magazine and the shell dropped out." "How long had John Perry been employed there?" "I couldn't say; some time." "I presume his room was the end room from the bath-room; a distance of two or three feet. Perry was going towards the staircase when I first saw him. Sam was coming towards me." People quickly began to assemble at the house. Witness could not say definitely how soon they got there. "Where was the sofa on which your brother lay?" "It was across the fireplace in the chamber." "When you discovered the body and removed it to the rug of the bath-room floor, and when you remarked that your brother was near, did your brother come in?" "He could see the body from where he was. He did not, to my knowledge, touch it." Questioned by Mr. Lee, for defense, witness said his brother 'phoned: "Come down, Frank, right quick. Somebody has knocked me down, and, I think, has shot Fannie. "I stopped at no intervening house going to his house. "I spoke to nobody. I went direct without pause. Arriving, I found the front door ajar and went directly up stairs. Sam was on the stairway near its head. I first saw John Perry between the front door and the stairsteps. Saw brother's wound when I got in the hall, blood was dripping to his undershirt. One hand was pressed to his head. He never gave me any clear explanations. "Sam came down the hall as we removed the body from the tub and stood by the window facing the bath-room door. He said, on seeing what we were doing, `Oh, my God! My darling wife.' Then he dropped down helpless. "Drs. Early, Venable and myself were down on our knees looking for evidence. We were striking matches. The gas jet was lit, too. "We saw no sign of any undershirt or piece of cloth," said witness in response to Mr. Lee's questions. "None of the three discovered any such thing. I was making a very careful examination, as were the other doctors. Yes; I was on my knees, too." "The wound on Mrs. McCue's nose was a small contused wound; not severe. Wound on side of right ear was only contused. It would have produced insensibility, but how long a time I can't say." Dr. McCue emphasized quite positively his statement first made before the coroner's jury that his brother, Sam, was in a dazed condition when he arrived at his house that Sunday night, and remained so for two or three days. "My brother," he said, "seemed to be suffering from general pain in his head. Willie McCue was given some medicine to produce sleep. Sam doesn't take medicine, but that night I offered to give him what I thought was proper—a hypodermic of strychnine and morphia. He refused. I wanted to quiet his nerves. Dr. Early was preparing his hypodermic; I also took out mine. Sam said he thought he could stand things without medical aid." "When you reached the home of the accused what did he say?" "He appeared to be dazed. I never was able to get any definite history from him. He was dazed for several days afterwards. He just hit me in the back and said, `Go hunt for Fannie.' He didn't indicate whether she was alive or dead." Dr. McCue testified to a bleeding wound on his brother's cheek, which he saw when he entered the house. "When I was called back by some one looking after Sam, I saw his nose was bleeding. Blood was oozing from his nose; I saw it. After any injury to the head we often look for bleeding from the nose. It is one of the symptoms we carefully observe." "My brother's wound showed a broken skin, considerable swelling, discoloration and laceration of the flesh. I think it was made by a blunt instrument, possibly a sandbag." Mr. Lee asked what sort of a wound a sandbag blow would produce. "It would knock one senseless, but it would have to be a right good blow to produce that wound." Dr. Hugh T. Nelson testified as follows: "I have been a practising physician twenty-seven years and reside on High street. At ten minutes after 10 o'clock Sunday night I heard that Sam McCue's house had been burglarized and that both Mr. McCue and wife had been killed. I went at once to the McCue house and saw Mr. McCue lying on a sofa. "I asked him about the tragedy. He said, `It began in here.' "Later I went to see the body of Mrs. McCue and soon after left the house. "I saw what seemed to be a scratch on Mr. McCue's right cheek bone. The wound seemed to be very slight. It was like a child had scraped his knee on the ground. "My opinion is that a blow on the cheek to have produced unconsciousness would have produced discoloration and a `puffing up.' Unless done with the first, it would almost certainly have fractured the jaw bone. "McCue seemed to be worried, but perfectly rational." The witness had seen a sandbag. He thought a blow with a sandbag on the back of the head, if sufficient to cause unconsciousness, must necessarily leave some evidence of the blow. It would probably have caused some vomiting and would have a tendency to make the pulse slow. There was nothing in Mr. McCue's manner or condition which suggested to Dr. Nelson's mind that he had been knocked unconscious. There was cross-questioning by Mr. Lee on the subject of sandbags, sandbag wounds, etc., but without important results. Dr. Charles S. Venable, son of the late distinguished professor of mathematics in the University of Virginia, saw McCue about an hour after the murder. He went with Dr. McCue to the bath-room. Much blood was on the head of the tub. The little rug was saturated. Dr. Venable said: "Dr. McCue, when I asked about the accused, said he was doing pretty well. Dr. Browning, who also went in, spoke to Mr. McCue and expressed his sympathy. I did the same thing. He said he did not know how it happened; somebody had run in from Ruby's room and grappled with him. Mr. Sam McCue asked the question, `Is she dead?' Dr. McCue replied: `Yes, Sam, she is dead.' The accused said, `My God.' I was surprised at the question and also that Mr. McCue didn't know his wife was dead. I was also surprised at his expression—no Diagram of 2nd floor of McCue's residence. sign of emotion, grief or sorrow. There was no tremor of his hand which I held. I saw a wound on his face. He was wiping it with a handkerchief. It was oozing a little. It was in the form of an abrasion—no bruise or swelling like that caused by a child skinning its knee on bricks by falling down. It seemed to be the result of a glancing blow. I examined the wound the next day—Monday—about noon. I then made a careful examination. Then there was no swelling or suffused blood. He had a pain at the back of the head. I couldn't locate it." Witness was asked if wound might have been caused by a sand-bag blow. He said such a wound might be made without abrasion, but swelling would have set in the next day. "How could that cheek wound have been made?" "I have most frequently seen it on foot-ball players who have been scraped on the ground. The epidermis was scraped." "Were there other injuries about the mouth or teeth?" "We found none. A sandbag on the part of the face where Mr. McCue was struck would have produced an enormous swelling by the next day. "I don't think the wound on McCue's face was such a one as would indicate an injury sufficient to cause unconsciousness. "J. Samuel McCue, on the day after the crime, was perfectly rational. I saw no difference in his condition that night or next day—no bleeding of the nose." Dr. J. Emmett Early, who lives on Park street, a short distance from the residence of J. Samuel McCue, has practiced medicine in Charlottesville for ten years. He went to McCue's house, walked into the chamber, saw the accused lying on the floor weeping with his face down. He wanted to give McCue medicine. Then Dr. McCue came in and said: "You take charge of William. I will take charge of Sam." Witness gave William a hypodermic. Dr. McCue came up and said: "Give this to Sam; he won't let me administer it." Accused meanwhile had gotten on the sofa. "Prisoner said: "Emmett Early, you or Frank can't give me a hypodermic. I don't want it. I have never taken any morphine." Witness added: "McCue's tone was commanding. Then I desisted. I had no conversation with the accused that night. I saw Judge Duke, among others, and was asked to serve on the coroner's jury. When I said I would rather not, I was asked to examine the body. "When I first saw McCue I didn't notice any wound. Later I saw him wiping his cheek. There was a slight abrasion on the right cheek. I examined the wound the next day. There was a slight abrasion, like a foot-ball man, like a boy falling and hurting his knee in the sand. No contusion on his head. I opened the hair and examined the scalp. I made this examination Monday. Can't say whether it was morning or afternoon. There was very little swelling; no bruise, no discoloration whatever. The prisoner's wound could not have produced insensibility." Next day Dr. Early saw no signs of a blow on the head. A sand-bag blow, according to witness, would have left some mark, some contusion, no matter what the instrument used. Witness did not see McCue's nose bleeding when he reached the house on the night of the murder. Wound on Sam McCue's face could not have been produced by the base-ball bat. Witness said a cheek blow, which would have produced insensibility, would have left discoloration, swelling, and contusion. The accused had the least little swelling on the cheek the day after the murder. By Captain Woods: "If a man were struck on the hairy part of the head with a sand-bag, would a blow causing insensibility leave evidence of itself on the head?" "It would produce some evidence—swelling and discoloration of the blood." Questioned by a juror, witness said the accused looked as usual, mentally, on the night of the crime and the day after. His mind was clear. He was in great grief when witness first arrived; recovered himself later, however. The physicians described quite fully the wounds on the body of Mrs. McCue, and their statements are similar, except that Dr. Early saw slight evidences, on Sunday night, that the victim had been choked, while Dr. McCue observed no finger marks about the throat. Dr. Venable said the lace on the gown had been torn off. The right ear had been struck a downward blow by a blunt instrument. The ear was very much discolored; had bled very freely. The next wound was a small lacerated wound on the nose; no bones broken, much blood. The third wound was a small transverse wound on the back of the head, but it gave out little blood. "I concluded," said the doctor, "that that wound happened afterwards. I believe it would be produced by falling with her head back and hitting the bath tub. We also examined the rest of the body. Then we came to the gunshot wound. There were powder marks right in the wound; it was black. The shot had gone downward and backward and tore all to pieces several ribs. Leather wad was taken from the spinal column. There was a great deal of disorganized blood in the cavity. We turned the corpse over, which caused blood to pour out. Next day I found a finger nail broken; also finger marks on her neck. Think they were produced before death." Captain Woods here asked the witness' opinion as to when the gunshot wound was inflicted. The defense's objection was sustained. Captain Woods then asked would it have been possible for Mrs. McCue, after having been shot, to go into the tub herself and place herself in the position described. "I don't think so." Dr. Early examined the body casually Sunday night, and more carefully the next day. Monday's examination plainly revealed finger marks on the neck—a left-hand grip—impressions of four fingers, which seemed to have slipped. "I noticed the same thing Sunday night," added witness, "but the marks were slight then. Next day they were very noticeable." The physician said that death from a gunshot wound like Mrs. McCue's would result almost instantaneously. The person would drop in his tracks after receiving such an injury. The gun must have been two feet from the body when fired. The wound on the ear might have been produced by an instrument like the base-ball bat in evidence. The bloody gown worn by Mrs. McCue on the night of the fatal 4th of September was frequently exhibited in court and identified by various witnesses. It had an important part in the gruesomely spectacular part of the trial, but it was not so much a key to any mystery of that night's tragedy as the bloody undershirt worn by the accused. That it was bloody was beyond denial, but whence came the blood—and at what crisis—was very much in question. Dr. McCue was asked how his brother was dressed when he reached the house. "Sam McCue," said the witness, "wore an undershirt, pants and slippers when he first saw him." "What became of that undershirt?" asked Captain Woods. "It was taken from my brother during the time the last examination was being made." Here witness was shown the shirt. He thought it was the one Sam McCue wore. Mr. Gilmer, Commonwealth's Attorney, had asked witness to get the shirt that night. Witness found the shirt in a clothes basket. Couldn't remember whether he asked accused where it was, but certainly asked somebody. Witness got the shirt from the prisoner's room, as well as he remembered; gave it to Undertaker Biery with other bloody garments. There was some evidence of hemorrhage on the shirt. Witness didn't observe the garment closely. "The blood, I presume," he said, "was coming from my brother's face. I actually saw it bleeding." "The undertaker came into the room after the examining physician had made their examination. "The shirt was taken off the last thing at night, just as the undertakers were getting ready to leave the house," added the witness. "When I found the shirt it was mixed in with the clothes in the regular clothes basket. Some one certainly told me it was there. There was no effort to conceal it; absolutely nothing of the kind." "Was the shirt so torn as to render it improper for him to go before the ladies?" "If he had been in his natural condition he would not have done it, and later he put on another shirt, a neglige shirt." Dr. Venable took the undershirt, and at Mr. Lee's request described each of the "washed" spots separately. He did this so the court stenographers could record his testimony with absolute accuracy. Next he gave the location and number of the "unwashed" spots. The accused, during the taking of this evidence, watched the witness intently, though his gaze frequently shifted towards the galleries. It seems to this writer that the prisoner has changed remarkably since this morning; that his face now shows intense anxiety. His eyes, though they have lost none of their steely glitter, are red around their rims and begin to grow hollow. Dr. Venable found eight "washed" spots and eleven spots which had not come in contact with water. He and Mr. Lee together held the undershirt up before the jury. Mr. Lee called the attention of witness to the fact that some of the "washed" spots were in close proximity to those which he said were "unwashed." Witness admitted this. One spot Dr. Venable could not speak definitely about; that is to say, he could not tell whether it had been washed or not. Dr. Venable said that certain bloody portions of the shirt evidently had been wet. They looked as if they had been washed out. One or two spots seemed not to have been washed. Certain faded stains, however, evidently had been wet. In answer to a question from the defense, the Doctor said he did not mean that the undershirt had been scrubbed, simply that it had come in contact with water. Dr. Early, while on the stand, was shown the bloody undershirt worn by McCue on the night of the crime. He had first seen the garment at the coroner's inquest. Dr. Early said that the stains were due to blood. He was here asked to point out the discolorations which had been moistened by water. Both sleeves seem to have been wet at the wristbands, said the physician. The dampness from water seems to have extended all around the stains. Witness here took the shirt and pointed out the various stains to the jury. He thought very few had been discolored by water. The theory of the defense was that the shirt was stained as a result of being handled by persons whose hands were bloody, and also of being wrapped with other garments and cloths that had been saturated with blood and bloody water. Mr. Marshall Dinwiddie testified that he had received the shirt from Dr. McCue just after he had been helping the embalmer. "We had not then washed our hands," he said. "I handed the shirt to Undertaker Biery. He rolled it up. He had not then washed his hands." Mr. Biery testified that he had finished embalming the body when the shirt was handed him, but was not through with moving it around. The stenographer who took his testimony before the coroner's inquest said Mr. Biery had said he had not finished embalming when the shirt was handed to him. Mr. Biery was positive that he wrapped up the shirt entirely separate from other garments. There was one distinct mark on the back of the shirt which seemed to have been made by the fall of a drop of blood, and which could not have been made by coming into contact either with bloody hands or other bloody clothing. One of the links in the chain of evidence was a piece of goods found under the bath-tub, behind the door, on Monday while the coroner's inquest was being held in the McCue residence. It was stained with blood, and was alleged to have been torn from the undershirt worn by the accused that night. Mr. Durrette took the fragment to the coroner and told how and where it had been found. To the court he stated, in answer to questions by Mr. Lee, that the position of the scrap was such that he certainly would have seen it in the room had he gone there on the night of the crime. But his deposition before the coroner's inquest said otherwise, and indicated that the cloth was in an obscure part of the room. All of the physicians testified that they had examined the bath-room that Sunday night for evidence, but they did not find the cloth. This fact the defense regarded as significant. Dr. Early went into the bath-room with Dr. Venable. Does not remember whether door was closed or not. They had candles and matches. Witness didn't examine thoroughly under the tub, and didn't see a "little piece of cloth on the floor." Didn't know whether he would have seen it or not had it been there. His examination was not thorough. Dr. Early said the candle was held over the tub. Witness wouldn't say the room door was shut, though Mr. Lee pressed him hard on this point. He did say, however, that if any one had knelt down in the bath-room Sunday night after the crime his trousers would have been dampened by the water on the floor. Dr. Venable was of opinion that matches were struck while the examination was being made in the second examination of the bath-room. The examination was made for the purpose of getting evidence. Witness personally did not look under the tub. He couldn't say that Dr. McCue did not. Witness saw no piece of undershirt in the room. He didn't know whether he would have seen such a thing or not had he been there. Mr. Lee sought to induce witness to admit that had a bloody piece of cloth been in the room he (Dr. Venable) would have seen it. Witness said his search was not a scrutinizing one. In some places he and his companions glanced around but casually. Before allowing Drs. Venable and Early to stand aside, Mr. Lee, of the defense, drew their attention to discrepancies between the testimony they had given at the coroner's inquest and that now submitted to the jury. Mr. Lee: "Didn't you say at the inquest that Mrs. McCue might have stepped over into the tub?" "I don't think I did," replied Dr. Venable. "If I did it is against my judgment at present." Mr. Lee here read part of Dr. Venable's evidence at the inquest, which showed that the physician in court had a slightly different recollection of the matter from what he formerly had. Dr. Venable was of opinion that a sand-bag blow would produce a swelling, though he admitted he had never seen a sand-bag wound. He said he didn't think a sand-bag blow would leave much sign of external injury. He thought, however, it would leave a swelling. The Doctor said the nail on the left hand of Mrs. McCue—the tip of it—was broken and turned back. Mr. Lee read some of Dr. Early's evidence at the inquest, wherein the Doctor had expressed the opinion that the accused must have been hit with a sand-bag. Witness admitted that he used the language quoted and the word "sand-bag." Dr. Early here said he had reconsidered the matter. Whatever he testified to at the inquest, Dr. Early said, he was of a different opinion now.</field>

Brutal and Inconsiderate Treatment of Wife by Accused—"His Life a Hell on Earth," says McCue. "That Woman" the Most Jealous He Had Ever Known. Witnesses Testify to Loving Relations—Letters Introduced to Prove the Same. The home life of the McCues was described by several witnesses, especially by Ernest Crawford, a brother of Mrs. McCue. According to his story there was little happiness under the roof of the ex-Mayor. The lawyers regarded the testimony of Mr. Crawford of sufficient importance to call forth their best efforts for its impeachment; and he was assailed with a vigor not shown elsewhere unless in the attempt to discredit the physicians who testified as experts. Mr. Crawford is a practising attorney of Harrisonburg, Va., of winning appearance and ingratiating manners. He was entirely self-possessed throughout a rather rasping cross-examination by Mr. Lee. "I went to board at the McCue home in 1899," said Mr. Crawford, "and remained there until 1901. I stayed in the room known as the boy's room, on same floor as that of Mrs. McCue. The house being heated by a furnace, the doors were often open. Soon after I got there I saw that the relations between Mr. and Mrs. McCue were very strained. "It was the most unhappy couple I ever saw. I would have left if it had not been that I thought I could be of some help to my sister. The quarrels were always about other women. Once I heard a violent quarrel between Mr. and Mrs. McCue. I never saw him kick or strike her, but have heard him curse her in the most violent manner repeatedly. "I did not interfere. I was younger then, very delicate, and did not want any notoriety. I thought they did not. I tried to pacify them. "This particular quarrel arose over Mr. McCue going into the lot back of his house with another woman of this city. Mrs. McCue said to him, `This is not the only time I have caught you in a compromising position,' and continued that she had gone to his office and had found him locked up in his office with women and that he looked `sheepish.' "I saw Willie McCue at 3 o'clock Monday afternoon after the murder. He said to me then that on one occasion his father ran his mother in his (Willie's) room, and that when he sought to interfere his father threatened to kill him; also said that his father and mother lived like cats and dogs. My brother Edgar was present at the time. Willie repeated this statement later, and said that they had had frequent quarrels; that on Sunday night of the murder, while he was on the porch, his father came out and said he had stood this thing as long as he intended, and be damned if he would stand it any longer. He told me that he believed his father had killed his mother." Mr. Crawford testified to making arrangements with young McCue to produce John Perry at the Monticello wine cellar for an interview with Detective Baldwin, and to some other matters which need not be considered in this place. Mr. Lee, in the way of cross-examination, insinuated the fact that Mr. Crawford stood by and saw his sister abused and cursed, and that he was telling tales after accepting the hospitality of the accused. "I did not accept the hospitality of the accused," replied Mr. Crawford. "I paid my board regularly. I did not interfere. I was very frail at the time; was suffering from appendicitis. No operation was performed. My health was delicate until a year or two after I left Charlottesville. I have only been at the McCue house once since I left. It was no pleasure to visit them. I attended the University with Mr. Webb Raines. He may have been at my room occasionally. "Did you not tell Raines that if you could do as well as McCue— marry and have as happy a home as he—you would be delighted?" "I did not. I may have said that he was prosperous, and that I would be satisfied if I could do as well as he. "I did tell Mr. Burks that Mr. McCue was a man that I admired from a business standpoint. I did not say that he was a model man." "Did you not try to-day to induce Mr. Burks and Mr. Decker to change their statements so as to make it conform to yours?" "I have no recollection of doing anything of the kind." "While here at the University I did ride the horse of the accused and drove his horses. I also carried his watch while here. I never wore his clothes, but did use his gun." "Did not you and Baldwin have a conversation with Perry in Willie McCue's presence, in which you said: `Now, Baldwin, here is where you have got to use some money?' " "I did not." Miss Bertie Crawford, an older sister of the late Mrs. McCue, next took the stand. She was in deep mourning. She said: "I lived in Staunton; my home is at Mt. Sidney, Augusta county. I had various opportunities of observing the treatment of the accused towards his wife. It was very inconsiderate. "I was at their house a week before my sister's death. The first evening I got there my sister was in a highly nervous state. Fannie was lying down at supper time. I took the supper up to her. Later we both went down-stairs together. "The accused had not seen her for several days. He had been absent in Washington. When we came down-stairs, although my sister was sick, Mr. McCue did not speak to her, and when my sister complained about his absence and inquired where he had been, he replied that it was not necessary for her to know anything about his trips. He took another trip from home later. Mrs. McCue got one letter from the accused while he was absent, and was indignant at its contents. I don't know what was in the letter. "I was also at the McCue house last March. Mr. McCue was as indifferent and inconsiderate as at other times. He did not treat her as a husband should treat a wife." W. W. Brand was next. "I have lived in Charlottesville all my life— seventy-five years. I was at the McCue home last summer fixing up some tiling. Mrs. McCue was showing me about it when the accused passed through the room. He spoke very bitterly to her. He spoke very roughly—as if he could have killed her in a second. He must have been mad before he came into the room. I don't remember the words used, but he was very angry." George Thomas (colored) is sixty years old. He works at the City Hall. He has seen Mr. and Mrs. McCue pass frequently in and out of the City Hall. Last May Mr. McCue went away for about a week. His wife came and asked the witness about her husband. When the accused came up, satchel in hand, his wife was sitting in a buggy, and said, "Mr. McCue." "I didn't hear him reply. Mr. McCue didn't go where she was. Later she said, `Are you going home?' He promptly said, `No.' Mr. McCue didn't shake hands with his wife." Answering Mr. Lee, the witness said he did not know how often the accused had been with his wife that day, or what time he got in on the train. Answering Captain Woods, Thomas said: "Mr. McCue's manner was not as pleasant as I thought it should be to a `nice, affectionate wife.' I generally kisses my old lady sometimes at night when I have just been away one day." Several witnesses were put on the stand to contradict Ernest Crawford. Preparing for this, the defence recalled that gentleman, who, in answer to questions, said he was at University with S. G. Waller; visited at Mrs. Moore's house; knew Miss Addie Moore; once went there with Mr. Waller. Knew nothing of discussing honeymoons there and saying "Mr. and Mrs. McCue have been married fifteen years and their honeymoon is not yet over." Witness admitted that again and again he spoke of McCue's prosperity and fine home. He absolutely denied he ever discussed his domestic relation. Answering Captain Woods: Hasn't been in Moore home since June, 1901. S. G. Waller, called by the defence: Is 23 years old; lives at Front Royal, Va.; at University with Ernest Crawford. Had paid a visit to the Moores with Ernest Crawford. Had heard Crawford make a statement about the McCue's long "honeymoon." Used language to that effect. Overheard Crawford, in discussion about pleasant married life, say Mr. and Mrs. McCue had an ideal home; although they had been married many years their honeymoon was not yet over. Doesn't know how lawyers discovered his information. Has no connection with the case, but was several times a guest at the McCue's. Has no bias in the case. Answering Captain Woods: The incident occurred about 1899 or 1900, in Mr. Waller's first year at college; probably Crawford's first year, too. Can't recall the language used, only the impression made on witness' mind. Understood, however, that Crawford made the statement. Doesn't remember whether it was addressed to him or to somebody else. Several there; talk was free and easy. Can't recall other subjects discussed. Answering Mr. Lee: Had tried to be very careful in this matter; was talking with friend of the case. In reading account of preliminary examination his attention was called to Crawford's statement about McCue family and the unhappiness which had prevailed there. Answering Captain Ker: Hadn't thought of incident a single time until the McCue case came up. Miss Willie R. Moore, lives in Rappahannock county; is a teacher; once lived in Charlottesville for three years. Knew Ernest Crawford then; also Mr. Waller; they visited her. Asked if she had ever heard Crawford speak of the long "honeymoon" in the McCue household, she said: "Yes, he did. He was speaking of matrimony, and said if he ever married he would like to lead the life his brother and sister lived; that their honeymoon was not then over." Witness remembered the remark distinctly. Has no interest in the case; had just reached Charlottesville. Answering Captain Woods: Several were present during the conversation, "running on in a pleasant way." Miss Crawford and Waller and witness' mother and sister were there. Waller said matrimony was "an all right thing." (Laughter.) Captain Woods smilingly asked witness whose views she liked best on the subject. Witness blushed deeply. Mr. Lee objected to question as embarrassing. Captain Woods gladly withdrew the question. Witness said Crawford frequently spoke of the McCues' happy life. Usual topics of conversation were discussed during these visits. Webb Raines, Chesapeake and Ohio yard master's stenographer in Richmond. He was a student at the University of Virginia with Ernest Crawford. Mr. Lee asked about Crawford's references to happiness in McCue's family. Witness said he had heard Crawford make several such statements. Seemed to have reference to domestic happiness of the McCues. Witness never had any talk with relatives or lawyers of the accused until he got here to-day. Answering Captain Woods: Uncertain when he had these talks with Crawford, probably during his second session. He took Sunday walks with Crawford. He referred to McCue's success in business. Witness had been to prisoner's house once or twice. Crawford said if he could be as happy as accused and his wife he would be contented. Walked with Crawford frequently. Nothing particularly to impress talks on witness' mind. Crawford spoke of McCue's being a happy man. Witness was positive Crawford had said the domestic relations of prisoner and wife most happy. Nothing could shake him in this. Thomas H. Burke, next witness, lives in Harrisonburg, Va. Has joint office with Ernest Crawford; adjoining rooms. Knows Crawford well. Witness said Crawford told him he "admired McCue greatly"; that accused was a person whom young men "engaged in business" should pattern after. Made no reference to the "happy home" of accused. Answering Mr. Lee: "I have never heard of the domestic relations of Mr. and Mrs. McCue." Mr. Lee announced, upon hearing this, that his side also had been taken by surprise; that he would treat Mr. Burke as an adverse witness. Answering Mr. Lee: C. N. Conrad, Commonwealth's Attorney of Rockingham county, Va., had copy of paper containing Crawford's statement at inquest. Witness was not looking over Conrad's shoulder, but heard Crawford's statement aloud. Witness did then remark: "It is little contrary to what I have been given to understand. I have always heard Crawford speak pleasantly of McCue." Witness said news "was a kind of surprise," coming as it did, as Crawford hadn't confided in him about the McCues. Witness met Crawford in Charlottesville since trial. Crawford asked witness what witness knew—if he (Crawford) had ever mentioned "domestic relations." "Crawford asked what I was doing here; I approached him." Here counsel had a lively "spat" over the admissibility of witness' testimony. Mr. Burke was asked if he had heard Mr. Deckert say: "Look here, Crawford, you can't mould my testimony in this case. You may mould Burke's, but if you do he is not the man I take him to be." Witness said he had heard no such colloquy; that if he had he would have resented it. The defense did not neglect evidence to prove that the abode of the McCues was a happy home. Mrs. Martha Hanger, who lives in Staunton, visited Mr. and Mrs. McCue three years ago, and spent three days there. Relations of couple very cordial. Was guest during the Daughters of the American Revolution meeting. "I never visited a happier home," said the witness. Answering Captain Ker: Their relations were—"Oh! very cordial." Mrs. M. H. Crawford also lives at Staunton; knew Mrs. McCue since latter's girlhood. Also knew Mr. McCue; connected with Mrs. McCue. Had visited the couple; last visit four or five years ago. "I had every reason to believe Mr. McCue was a kind and very loving husband. If anybody had told me to point out a kinder and more loving husband I couldn't have done it, and that is the truth," solemnly said the matronly old lady. Mrs. E. O. McCue, a sister-in-law of the murdered woman, "went to Sam's very frequently, often went driving with Mrs. Sam McCue. The relations of the couple were most kindly; never observed anything else." Answering Captain Woods: Had been at the McCue home week before tragedy; visited in last year frequently, both day and evening. Mrs. M. J. Taylor; lives in Charlottesville, and is a seamstress. Has sewed at the McCue's frequently. Often saw husband and wife together; took meals at the house. "Never seen anything between them but what was right." Accused would kiss children goodbye; wife would go to the door with him; everything was congenial. Policeman Dan C. Grady deposed that he had often seen McCues at public places together; often out driving; at races, shows, etc. Conduct of accused exemplary, very attentive to wife; "waited on her as nice as any man I ever seen," added witness. They were together frequently. She was often at their office; he always went to trains for her. Answering Captain Ker's sarcastic question: Never saw them fuss in public or in the theatre. Frank Minor (colored) lives in West Virginia; left Charlottesville two and a half months ago. Lived at Sam McCue's nine and a half years; was butler. The husband and wife got along "as nicely as any married people could get along far as he knew of"; no quarrels, didn't hear of any. Was there all day. Was "dar at meal times," said ebon witness with a grin and the crowd roared. Worked with accused up to two and a half months ago. In the testimony of Mr. John S. White, a Charlottesville lawyer, the prosecution succeeded in getting before the jury McCue's remark that his home was not a happy one; that, indeed, it was a hell on earth. "I called to see the prisoner at the county jail on a matter of business," said Mr. White, "and told him I was sorry to bother him. He said it was all right, that he was being persecuted, and that he would come out of it all right. He said he was innocent. Later on he said, `My life here on earth for the past four or five years has been a perfect hell; that woman was the most jealous woman I have ever known.' He said he had scuffled hard to build up a practice and to make his home a happy one. In speaking of `that woman' he referred to his wife." On cross-examination by Mr. Lee the witness said he was in jail about thirty minutes. The accused seemed greatly distressed, but Mr. White did not recall that he spoke kindly of his wife. He did not tell the counsel for the defense, so far as he could recall, that he spoke kindly of his wife. He did speak of her in a very respectful manner. Mr. Crawford was called to the witness chair, and identified a large bundle of letters written by his sister to her husband. The prosecution had on the previous day, when the letters were under discussion, urged that their introduction would be misleading, as they would only cover a few periods of the married life of the accused. Judge Morris inclined to the belief that the letters could be read, but indulged the prosecution to the extent of giving the lawyers till the following day to decide whether to resist or consent to their going to the jury. The result was that Captain Woods, speaking for the prosecution, said the letters of Mr. and Mrs. McCue were admissible. They were then read. The following summary gives all that is significant, and will prove more interesting than the epistles entire. The letters were dated in 1899, 1900, and 1901. The first one began "My Darling Sweetheart," and described a visit to Raleigh Springs. Mrs. McCue tells her husband that she loves him more than ever before. The letter ends with the words, "With a heart full of love." Postal July 31, 1900: "My Darling Sweetheart" it begins, describes her illness while at springs.

Fisherville, January, 1899: "My Dear Sam," she begins. Anxious to hear from him; with love and a kiss, etc. The prisoner's tears were flowing freely long before this point was reached. Here his grief seemed especially bitter. Batesville, July, 1899: "Dear Sam," received letter and box of powder; motherly references to children. Don't keep Willie closely confined at the office; let him run about. Charlottesville, May 17, 1900: "My Dear Sam," describes sickness of children. Has missed him terribly.

They are matched in tenderness and solicitude by the husband's missives, written apparently with no thought of any woman on earth but the mother of the little ones to whom he refers more than once.

Dear little boys so fond of canteloupes, and of Jack, the mule. Here writer refers to money matters; says, "God has been so good to us." God bless you and return you in good health." July 30, 1900: "My Dear Little Darling"; heard most excellent sermon by Dr. Petrie; children have been riding in the lot; Jack, the mule, source of pleasure to Harry. "Do hope we can get off to Atlantic City, for I must have a little rest. Good-bye, darling; wish I could see you this morning. Devotedly, Your Old Sweetheart." July 26, 1900: "My Darling Little Wife: Your sweet little letter repeatedly read. Why so depressed? I was depressed, too, last night." Letter full of confidence in the Lord and affectionate in terms; describes the children's doings. "Darling, I send you last week's Sentinel. Little Harry said love to all up there. He is the sweetest thing on earth. Cheer up, darling; don't worry over William's trip; he can have a nice time here. I don't expect to confine him as I once did. He has had a far nicer trip than I ever had. I am at heavy expense. Will arrange to see my old sweetheart if possible. Remember me kindly to Ernest. Do you want to see your old sweetheart as badly as he wants to see you?" One who heard the letters read and observed the demeanor of the prisoner during their perusal, wrote: "That his sorrow was genuine none who saw him to-day can dispute. He was almost pitiful. One thing in particular struck this listener about the letters in evidence—their absolute purity and freedom from double entendre. Not a questionable word did any of them contain, not an expression, not a sentence, not a paragraph which could not have been read before a Sunday-school class and held up as a criterion in the way of epistolary art."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE QUICK OR THE DEAD. The Prisoner's Son Fights the "Battle of His Life"—Believed His Father Guilty—Put His Mother Before His God—Takes the Prosecution by Surprise—The Testimony in Impeachment—One of the Sad Features of the Trial. THE BATTLE OF HIS LIFE. One of the pathetic and regretable features of the trial was the connection with it of William McCue, the seventeen-year-old son of the accused. He was relied upon to some extent to confirm the testimony of Ernest Crawford, a brother of his mother, and that of Miss Bertie Crawford, a sister of his mother, that the McCues were latterly not a happy couple, but lived "like cats and dogs," and to prove that a violent quarrel took place at the supper table two hours and a half before the murder. Young McCue in physical appearance is a blend of the two families whose blood is mingled in his veins, and in face has the winning expression of a woman. One would say he is more Crawford than McCue, although in self-possession he has the almost stoic nerve of his father. He has written that he loved his mother better than his God, but those who watched him in court and out could not decide whether he had a similar strong affection for his father. The writer of this sat within two feet of young McCue as the boy stood just outside of the bar when his father stood for the first time to hear the reading of the awful charge contained in the indictment, and if any strong emotion struggled for expression it was repressed masterfully. There was not a movement of lip or eyelid or change of color to say what the heart felt. For a time it looked as if his testimony would be adverse to his father, and so well satisfied were the lawyers for the prosecution that he was summoned as a witness for the Commonwealth. According to sworn testimony he had made to at least four witnesses statements that indicated belief in his father's responsibility for the crime of September 4th. Detective Alfred Baldwin, of Bluefield, W. Va., testified that he arrived in Charlottesville on the day after the murder and went to work to discover the criminal. He met Willie McCue that night, but the first interview occurred the following morning. Ernest Crawford was with them at McCue's home. They talked half an hour on the porch. Willie McCue said he thought he was in a bad position, but added: "I can't help it. I am going to come right out with the truth. I have seen and heard so much I can't help thinking my father killed my mother." He couldn't help it. They had had a quarrel one night, and his mother ran into his room; father was following her with revolver; when Will interfered his father threatened to kill him. His mother was jealous; suspected intimacy with other women. McCue threatened Will about carrying news of these incidents to his mother. That Sunday evening Willie's father and mother were "mad." Willie judged this from their appearance when Willie couldn't find his father's paper just after supper. His father seemed very incensed, and said: "I am d—d tired of this thing. I'll not put up with it another day." Witness did not know to what the remark quoted had reference. The prisoner's son told the detective that when he carried his mother to the station she was crying on the way. He had to buy the ticket. Will wanted his mother to go to Red Hill, as she had something on her mind and was worrying about the behavior of his father. He thought the trip would afford her relief. (This was the visit to Red Hill from which Mrs. McCue returned, probably unexpectedly to her husband, a few hours before her death.) To continue the quotation from Mr. Baldwin's testimony: The witness (Albert Baldwin) said young McCue interviewed him three distinct times, possibly more than that, within the first week he was at the Gleason Hotel. "Monday Crawford asked Willie to meet us Tuesday; that is, after the funeral. Willie came at 4 o'clock, and said his delay was because he had to slip out of the house." On this occasion at the Gleason all three talked "in general" on the case. Willie was asked if he could get John Perry away from the house. (Perry is the stable boy who was in the room in the rear of the bath-room at the time the murder occurred, and is generally believed to have been the only person, except husband and wife, in the house when Mrs. McCue received her death wound.) "We arranged the wine-cellar meeting." Willie agreed to it. (The wine cellar is immediately back of McCue's residence, about 300 yards.) Crawford and Witness Baldwin went to the wine cellar; Willie and John Perry, the negro, came up. Willie said he would get a statement from Perry the following morning. He also said: "John, that is not what you told me this morning." Willie told witness he would talk to Perry next morning and bring it to Baldwin at the Gleason Hotel. He brought a written statement next day of what he said Perry told him. (Here witness identified paper shown him by Capt. Woods, for prosecution.) Witness said paper was handed him in presence of Ernest Crawford. McCue, in handing over the paper, said: "Here is that statement I got from John Perry." "I asked what was the meaning of the writing on the back. Willie said the words `My dear' were written at the head of the paper so that if any of the family came in he could say he was writing to a friend." "In the presence of Mr. Crawford and my brother he said three or four times that he believed his father had killed his mother." Detective W. G. Baldwin deposed that Willie McCue said in his presence and that of his brother that he believed his father killed his mother. It was hard for him to go against his father, but he couldn't help believe it. Mr. N. R. Martin, the jailer, said that he was present at a conversation between the prisoner and his son Willie. It was on the Sunday evening before the accused was indicted by the grand jury. Several of the brothers of the accused were present. The accused turned to his son and said: "You know what Crawford said about my drawing a pistol on your mother is not true?" Willie said: "Yes it is; you know she ran and got in my bed and asked me to defend her." Mr. McCue said: "Didn't Mrs. McCue have the pistol?" Willie replied: "How could she have had the pistol when she ran and got in bed with me?" The prisoner then asked: "What was the fuss about?" Willie said that it was about "that woman," but Willie did not know which woman was meant. The witness said that three brothers of the accused were in the jail at the time. (These afterwards contradicted his evidence.) Mr. Edgar A. Crawford testified: "I heard Willie say that on a certain occasion his father had drawn a pistol on his mother, she had run to him, and that when he started to protect his mother his father had pointed the pistol at him. I said: `Willie, your home was not then a happy one?' "He said: `No; for the past three or four years it has been a perfect hell on earth. My father and mothed lived like cats and dogs.' " Miss Gertrude Irving, who lives near the University of Virginia, testified that Willie McCue went home with her from church on the Sunday after the tragedy, and told her he dreaded the witness stand, as he would rather die than tell some things he would have to disclose. His family, he said, had always been very reticent as to certain things. C. Julian Paoli, druggist, with Charles R. Link &amp; Co., next witness: Has known Willie McCue since 1899; knows him very well. Willie cameto Link's store Tuesday after his mother's funeral, about 5 P. M. Willie came in behind counter. Witness expressed sympathy. Will said: "Do you know what position I have taken?" Witness said, "No." Will said: "Well, I have sided with my mother, against my father." Witness advised Willie to tell the truth, as a witness, regardless of consequences. Will said: "Then people will say that my evidence hung my father." Witness urged Willie not to perjure himself, remarking that possibly his father would not be convicted. A letter written by Willie McCue certainly seems in direct line with his alleged utterances to the persons whose testimony is set out above. The admission of the letter was strongly resisted by the defense. Captain Micajah Woods, of the prosecution, insisted that it was relevant to show the influences under which Willie had been. The Court admitted the letter, after it had been identified by its author as one he had written to a sister of his mother, Mrs. E. L. Greaves, of Athens, Ga. The letter follows: Charlottesville, Va., Sept. 17, 1904. Dear Aunt Sallie,—I received your kind and affectionate letter a few minutes ago, and will answer now, as I am afarid I will forget it. We are now at home with Aunt Sammie and Uncle Marshall Dinwiddie, who are very kind and good to us, but I come home and miss my dear mother, whom I put before my God, and who I miss many times in the day. Aunt Sallie, I am fighting one of the greatest battles now. I am among all my father's people, and they, of course, wonder why I took such a step in this case, but I am going to do what I think is right, in God's care, in spite of any human being living. I never will be in worse trouble than this. I cannot sleep, and when I go to bed and wake up with the same trouble I feel as though I cannot stand it. I have got only one thing to live for now, my little sister, who is dearer to me than ever before. Your affectionate nephew, William. The evidence of William McCue is given quite fully, as it contributes something to the story, and especially as that course is a measure of fairness which is gladly accorded him: "I am the oldest son of the accused. I was on Main street on the night of the tragedy. Mother went to Red Hill Friday and father went on the C. &amp; O. train east Saturday morning. Mother returned Sunday evening at 5 o'clock. I met her. "At 6 o'clock, an hour later, my father returned. Father went in the house from the rear. I was at home all the time my parents were absent. My brothers were at Mr. Browning's. My sister Ruby left with my mother, but remained at Red Hill. Father wrote me that he would return home Saturday or Sunday. "John Perry occupied the room over the kitchen. The door between his room and the main house was always locked. It was locked that night. Father had three guns. Generally he kept two in his room, by the side of the wardrobe." Here the witness identified the gun shown him. THE WEAPONS USED BY MURDERER. "The guns were sometimes loaded and sometimes unloaded. I can't say whether that gun was loaded that night or not. (Here he examined the base-ball bat.) "The base-ball bat generally stayed in the yard. I can't say where it was that night. The last time I saw it, it was in the garden. It belonged to my little brother. Cartridges laid all around the house. We had no special place for them. Some were in the wardrobe, some were in the hall, and some in my room. "Mother was in the library when father came home. Mrs. C. G. Maphis was with her. At the supper table, we talked over matters generally. Mother reprimanded me for letting negroes drive our horses to Keswick. We all left supper table together. Here the Commonwealth laid ground for an impeachment of the witness. Did you not tell Ernest Crawford and Mr. Albert Baldwin that your mother and father had frequently quarreled and that they quarreled on the night of the tragedy at the supper table?" inquired Captain Woods. "I did not," replied the witness. "Did you not repeat this in the presence of Mr. Ernest Crawford and of Mr. W. G. Baldwin and Mr. Albert Baldwin at the Gleason Hotel?" "I did not." "Did you not repeat this at the wine cellar before the same men, and did you not bring John Perry to the wine cellar?" "I did not." "Did you no longer than yesterday tell Ernest Crawford you would tell the jury exactly what you had told him all along?" "I told him I would tell the truth." "Did you not say to the Baldwins at the Gleason Hotel that you knew your father killed your mother?" "I did not. I went there twice at their request." "Did you not get this statement (showing him a letter) from Perry and did he not say to you in the presence of Mr. Crawford that he had not told the truth before the coroner's jury; that he was afraid the accused would kill him?" "I did not. This statement of Perry is in my handwriting. I gave it to Mr. Baldwin. Perry said he had told the truth before the coroner's jury." "Did you not tell Mr. Julian Paoli that you were in a terrible fix; that if you told the truth you would hang your father, and people would always point to you as having hung your father?" "I did not. I talked to Mr. Paoli and he advised me to tell the truth." The witness said that John Perry took meals daily to the jail for the accused. He works at the McCue house. "On Sunday evening, father and mother were at the door going to church. In about five minutes, father came back to the house and asked where mother was. I told him she had gone to church. He then followed her. I was near the City Hall when I heard of the tragedy and went home at once." "I did take letters from father's office after his arrest and give them to Detective Baldwin. They were purely business letters." "Didn't you tell the Crawfords and Baldwins that your mother was very jealous?" "No, sir." "Didn't you tell them that your mother told you to watch women going to your father's office; that she had reason to suspect meetings there?" "I deny it emphatically." Defense objected to this question and answer, but the Court overruled the objection, saying the question was designed to impeach the witness. "Do you remember going from church, the Sunday after your mother was killed, with Miss Gertrude Irvine and taking dinner there?" "Yes." "Do you remember telling her, in speaking of the tragedy, that your people were very reticent about speaking of what happened in the family, that you dreaded going on the witness stand." "No, sir, I did not, I told her people were worrying me with questions." "Didn't you say that on hearing of the tragedy you thought of killing yourself but you remembered your mother's telling you to look after the children in case anything happened." The objection to this question by the defence was sustained. "In a talk at Gleason Hotel with W. G. and Albert Baldwin did you tell them that on hearing of the killing you knew your father had murdered your mother?" "I deny that emphatically." The witness here was excused. The witness was then recalled: "Do you remember going with Mr. Baldwin into the room where the body of your mother was?" "I did not." "Do you remember stating to him then that this was the first peaceful look you had seen on her face for years?" "I never said it." A correspondent describes the scene during young McCue's ordeal: William McCue, the 17-year-old son of the accused, was the central figure in the drama. Lawyers, judge, jury, and even the prisoner, dwindled into utter insignificance in comparison with the lad's mighty effort to save his father from the gallows. With eyes moistened by excess of emotion and his whole frame in a quiver, the usually sturdy boy sat in the witness chair like a hunted animal at bay, and, despite a cannonade of embarrassing questions, swore that his poor, dead mother had received naught but kindness at the hands of the stoical prisoner at the bar. In vain did Captain Micajah Woods, the prosecution's great engine of strength and aggressiveness, seek to daunt the lad with a maze of almost bewildering questions broadly hinting at a sudden somersaulting of the young witness's opinions. In vain did the stern attorney, grown gray in the wiles and subtleties of the law, strive to make William McCue break down and indirectly declare his father a murderer. Verily, it was a case of the quick or the dead! And the quick was the winner. Mayhap the memory of the unhappy woman, upon whose grave the flowers hardly yet have withered, still touched the heart of the son, who was wildly hysterical on the night she perished by an assassin's hand. And mayhap he will never forget the wretched but tender little woman who once ran to him, then a mere stripling, for protection from her husband. But the living are ever stronger than the dead; the present than the absent. Not ten feet from the witness chair where young William sat gleamed the metallic blue eyes of his father, boring into the very heart of the son like an augur of steel. Those cold blue eyes have subdued others. Yesterday they subdued young William McCue. There was at least one surprised man in the court-room when the boy witness, summoned by the prosecution in confidence and almost in triumph, veered quickly around as a witness for the defense. That one surprised individual was Captain Micajah Woods. Almost at the very outset the lawyer openly admitted his amazement and announced that he would avail himself of the privilege of questioning the son as a witness for the accused. To this the lawyers for the defense agreed. Then came the interrogatory bombardment, charged with the lyddite of sarcasm and the dynamite of unbelief. Captain Woods, in a word, hurled at the witness a rapid series of questions based on alleged statements William McCue had made to his mother's brother, Ernest Crawford. These statements all put the witness in the position of suspecting the guilt of his father, and of openly seeking to work the destruction of the accused. Indeed the witness, though he doggedly denied almost everything, unhesitatingly admitted that he had talked with his uncle and with detectives about the case; that shortly after the murder he attempted to get McCue's negro stable boy to confess that he had lied at the coroner's inquest. But the witness firmly, emphatically, almost indignantly denied that he had ever hinted at unpleasant relations existing between his father and mother. Nothing could shake him on this point; nothing could jolt his memory into recollecting a single instance where the bitter waters of domestic discord had muddled the fountains of Mr. and Mrs. J. Samuel McCue's matrimonial bliss. The one predominating, oft-repeated, crescendo note of young McCue's testimony was the expression: "No, I deny it emphatically."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIIII. THINGS THAT WERE HEARD. The Two Witnesses Who Heard the Fatal Shot—The Importance of One Little Word—Perry Was in Few Feet of the Murder—His Stories of What Happened on That Fateful Sunday Night—Which One is True? Of all the people in the community in which the McCue's lived, only two persons heard anything in the movement of the terrible drama. These were Charles A. Skinner, Mr. F. B. Moran's colored coachman, who, from his room across the lane from the McCue residence, heard things to which he testified very frankly; the other, John Perry, McCue's colored house boy, heard more, but seemed unwilling to tell as much. Skinner, while lying on his bed, heard crying and screaming. After a while he went to his window. Then he heard more piercing screams, which came from McCue's house. It looked as if somebody was in distress, just as if "somebody were dead over there." Witness then went back to bed, then heard the shot, and again hurried to the window. The screams were those of a woman. They lasted three or five minutes before the shot, probably longer. He didn't hear a man's voice. Witness thought somebody might have died from natural causes over at the McCue's house and that the family were in distress. Witness heard running footsteps on the pavement in front of Mr. Moran's. They seemed going towards Sam McCue's. This was after the shooting. The negro saw a dim light in the McCue house upstairs. He could only see one light towards the street. Several minutes later, witness heard "coarse crying." This was probably after Willie McCue had reached the house and given way to hysterical grief. The boy Perry, sixteen or seventeen years old, was employed by J. Samuel McCue at the time of the murder, and on the night of the crime heard, from his room on the second floor in the rear of the bathroom, the assault on Mrs. McCue, her last words, and the gunshot that put an end to her life. The prosecution believed that his evidence was of the greatest importance, and had him subpœnaed. But confidence in Perry, after the testimony of Willie McCue, was not strong, and the prosecution let him alone. So did the defense. Possibly both expected the court to put him on the stand, as in the end it did, complying with the request of a juror, Mr. Traylor. Judge Morris sent for the negro. He was questioned by Judge Morris and answered that he was working at McCue's the night of the murder. He did not hear them when they first came but afterwards heard wife say. "Sam, Sam, come and help me; he is killing me." The witness then tried to get in the house and get the gun. Mrs. McCue said, "Sam, Sam he is killing me" or "he is going to kill me." The witness heard the gun go off. Mr. McCue said, "Come in. Oh, John, I am in the wrost trouble I ever had in my life. A burglar has knocked me senseless and probably killed my wife." The witness said he was sleeping in the room over the kitchen and shut up the house before the couple went to church. He locked the dining door, but the door leading from the kitchen to the house was not locked. After Mr. and Mrs. McCue left, he went to his room and fell asleep. Mrs. McCue's screams awoke him. She was then in her chamber. Then she ran towards the bath-room. Perry heard her say, "Sam, Sam, he is killing me," while she was in her chamber. He heard a man go in the bath-room twice and then down the steps. He had on heavy shoes. It was four or five minutes after McCue opened the door leading from house hall into the witness' room. McCue then had on his slippers. The witness did not see the man who went into the bath-room but could hear him. Questioned by juror, the witness said the windows were up. The bathroom window was not up. He heard water running in the bath-room but could not get out of his room until he was let out—that is, he could not get into the McCue house proper. Three or four minutes after the gun went off Mr. McCue opened the door to let the witness in. The latter saw no blood on his shirt and none running from his person. There was no blood on McCue's undershirt and it was not torn. Answering Captain Woods, Perry said he occupied the room back of the bath-room. There is a little passage back of the bath-room and steps going down to the kitchen. He had been living at McCue's at the time of the crime over a month and has been living there ever since. He took meals to the prisoner and was sometimes in his cell. He is still employed at McCue's. "Did you see Mr. Baldwin Tuesday before the funeral?" The witness was here confronted by the detective. "Yes, sir." and Crawford." "Didn't he just before the funeral call you out of the room into your room? Didn't the other Baldwin come in also?" "Yes, sir." "Didn't W. G. Baldwin talk with you about the murder?" "Yes, he asked me the same questions as you are asking." "Did you explain it to him?" "I told him the same thing as at the inquest." "Did you say Mrs. McCue `gargled and gurgled?' " "No, sir." "Did you tell him you saw the bath-room full of smoke and that you and the accused went in?" "I told him about the smoke. We didn't go in." "Did Baldwin say, `All I want is the truth?' " "Yes, sir." "Did you tell him you heard Mrs. McCue say, `Sam, why do you treat me so. I'll never do so any more?' " "No, sir," doggedly said the witness. "Did you clean the gun Saturday?" "No, sir." "Didn't you say you cleaned it?" "No, sir. The gun was certainly not loaded," said the witness, "but I never took it out of the case." "After the funeral Tuesday didn't you take the meals to McCue's children at Mr. Dinwiddie's?" "No, sir. I didn't go at all." "Didn't you see Judge Lyons' two servants at the gate on the Tuesday afternoon after the murder—Susan Austin and Carry Perry, both colored women?" "Don't remember," first said the witness. A minute later he remembered going to Dinwiddie's. "Did you talk with them?" "Yes, sir." "Didn't you tell them you were in your room during the killing; that you heard a considerable fuss and that you heard Mrs. McCue say, `Oh Sam, Sam, don't kill me, I am going to die anyhow?' " "No, sir, not a word of it," emphatically said the stubborn witness. "And that then you ran your head out of a window to listen?" "No, sir, I didn't put my head out of no window." "That you heard a gun fired?" "Yes, sir." "That McCue then called you and that you two went down stairs." "No, sir, I didn't tole 'em that." "Do you remember going to wine cellar and seeing Messrs. Baldwin "No, sir. I went to Charlie Brown's. I went to the gas light. I saw them there and had a talk with them." "Did you have a talk the next morning with William McCue?" "Yes, sir." "Did he write your statement down on paper." "No, sir, he didn't have no paper in his hand." Capt. Woods here produced the paper written for witness by Willie McCue: "I said `John, now I want you to tell me just what you heard.' The first thing he said was, `You know last night I was afraid to tell those gentlemen on Mr. McCue. I heard him slap her first because I got up and put my head out of the window. Then it sounded like he was hitting her and thumping. Then I heard him choke her and heard ALBEMARLE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, WHERE THE TRIAL WAS HELD. her like she was strangled. She said, Sam, you ought not to treat me like this. I will promise not to do it again.' " Perry said young McCue must have put in some of the things himself. He didn't say them. "I didn't tole him that," was Perry's every answer. He didn't see Willie write down a line. If he wrote it he wrote what was not true." Answering Mr. Lee, John Perry said he had first been summoned as a witness for the Commonwealth. The jailor always went with him into McCue's cell when he took the meals. He had a conversation with the Baldwins on the Tuesday after the crime. He went to the wine cellar that night but had previously talked with the Baldwins. He could not tell when he last handled Mr. McCue's gun. He saw the gun about a week before the crime. Answering Capt. Ker, the negro said, "There were no children save William at home on the night of the crime. The little boys had been away a month; all except Sam. He was away three weeks. He last observed the gun when little Sam was at home. The witness was excused at this point. W. G. Baldwin, detective, in answer to Capt. Woods, said he saw John Perry on the Tuesday before the funeral at about noon. He was in his own room by appointment of William McCue. He said he had had a conversation with Willie; and warned him not to talk with outsiders. Perry told the witness he heard Mrs. McCue say: "Sam, why are you treating me so; what have I done? What have I done to you?" Then the boy heard a gurgling sound and subsequently a gunshot. The wife's cries aroused Perry. After the gunshot Perry arose and tried to get into the house. There were no questions by Mr. Lee. Detective Albert Baldwin was again recalled. He saw Perry the Tuesday before the funeral, about 12 o'clock, in a room at the back of the McCue home. It was his room. W. G. Baldwin went in with Perry and the witness followed behind him. Perry said he heard some one crying in the hall—near the bath-room. Perry tried to get in but could not do it. He heard Mrs. McCue say: "Sam, Sam, why do you treat me so. I will never do so any more." At this juncture William Hurley, colored, came in the room and that wound up the conversation with Perry. During the talk, Perry made a statement about the gun. Perry said he heard the lick struck, heard the cry and this appeal, "Sam, Sam, why do you treat me so? I shan't do so any more." He told W. G. Baldwin it was four or five minutes before McCue let him get into the hall. The prosecution proceeded to impeach Perry, calling for that purpose Susan Austin and Carrie Perry. Susan Austin, colored, lived at Judge Lyons at the time of killing, and had been there for three years. Mrs. Lyons home is just beyond the McCue's. She saw John Perry Tuesday night, after the funeral while she was standing at Judge Lyons' gate with Carrie Perry. Perry was coming from the Dinwiddie's. He said he heard the wife of Mr. McCue scream. He dressed but could not get out of the room. Then he heard McCue's wife say, "Sam, Oh Sam, you are killing of me. I am going to die anyhow." There were no questions by Mr. Lee. Carrie Perry, colored, lives at Judge Lyons and has been there one year. She is a "waitress." She saw John Perry the night of the funeral at the gate. Susan Austin also was there. C. W. ROGERS, City Sergeant of Charlottesville. Perry was coming from the Dinwiddie's. The woman had a talk with him. Perry told the witness he was in his room and heard Mrs. McCue's screams. He couldn't get out. He then heard Mrs. McCue say, "Oh, Sam you are killing me, I am going to die anyhow." A little later McCue let him out and told him that he was in terrible distress. The woman remembers Perry's words distinctly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. ODDS AND ENDS OF THE CASE. The Telephone Messages—Theories of the Prosecution and of the Defense—McCue's Insurance—Unconfirmed Story of Why Prisoner Did Not Testify Except for the few pages in regard to Lester Marshall, who was, for several hours, under suspicion, and who charges conspiracy to have him sacrificed to secure McCue's safety, this narrative has been confined to what transpired before the coroner's jury and later before the petit jury. The Commonwealth's theory was that when Mr. and Mrs. McCue met at the tea table on the evening of the murder a quarrel ensued and the husband was so exasperated that he walked the porch afterwards and, with an oath, declared that he was not going to stand it any longer; that Mrs. McCue went to and returned from church depressed by the feeling that the quarrel was only suspended, and that it would be renewed with results she feared to contemplate; that it was resumed as soon as husband and wife were at home, before they had gone to their bed-chamber, and continued while they were preparing to retire; that a fight occurred, during which Mrs. McCue was bludgeoned and choked, a gurgling sound accompanying her maltreatment; that fleeing to the bath-room the poor little woman, in piteous helplessness, begged for her life, and that a gun-shot, delivered within a foot of her breast, preceded by a despairing scream, ended all for her in this world. How, to a certain extent, the proof depended on the eldest son of the accused, and to a larger degree, upon his stable boy, the reader knows. It is a part of the story of the case in court that these witnesses did not meet the anticipations of the prosecution, and left the narrative without the expected symmetry. The evidence on the subject of the alleged jealousy of Mrs. McCue and the insinuated immoral life of her husband has been given, and those who read must judge how far it goes to proving the presence of an adequate motive for the commission of the crime by the husband. This was not, however, held by the prosecution as the real motive or reason for the crime, but only the cause whose effect—the beating, choking, and disfiguring of the wife by her natural protector—provided the motive; that is, the necessity for the concealment of his conduct if he was to maintain his place in the esteem of his neighbors. McCue, in his statement to the coroner's jury, thinks he called up his brother, Dr. McCue, first, and that he next 'phoned to the residence of Mr. T. J. Williams, requesting him, his wife, and his daughter, Mrs. Munson, to come to his house at once. He said he 'phoned also to the police. The prosecution contended that he never telephoned to anyone that night except to those at the residence of Mr. Williams. The two telephone operators who had charge that night of the board on which was Samuel McCue's number gave their testimony, the following report which affords a fair opportunity to understand its importance. Miss Virginia Bragg was the first of the operators to testify. She said the accused rang for the Williams' residence, and witness at first said "Busy," whereupon accused said, "Oh, don't tell me that; I think some one has shot and killed Fannie and is in my house now." Miss Bragg afterwards rang for police; told them to go to McCue house. This was the first message from the McCue house. Witness was on duty from 6 o'clock until morning. No 'phone message from Sam McCue for his brother, Dr. McCue. Positive about that; would remember it, certainly ten minutes back. Knows Mr. McCue's voice. He called for the Williams. Miss Bragg explained her "board" and said she would have received any call for Dr. McCue's residence that night. McCue's first remark was "Give me some one"—rather an unusual request. Then he said, Mrs. T. J. Williams' residence. Informed that 'phone was in use, he said, "Oh, don't tell me; some one is in the house, etc." Miss Bragg admitted she was excited on that night, but said she was not confused. "We are used to excitement. I knew what I was about." Witness left room after calling the police. Miss Bragg's testimony was more positive before the petit than it had been before the coroner's jury. On the former occasion she said, in answer to a question of Dr. McCue, that she "might have transmitted the message without noticing it particularly." Miss Bragg left her board for a few minutes that night, and Miss Lilian Busic took her place. She said there was no call from Sam McCue to Dr. McCue. "I am certain," said the witness, positively. Dr. McCue testified that he had received the message over the 'phone; his wife and another swore that they had heard the 'phone bell ring and saw the physician go toward it and heard him answer "All right." The defense's theory of the crime was that the murderer was an outsider, moved to the deed by desire for revenge, or by the hope of booty. Accordingly, it was shown by evidence that two or more windows were open, presumably left so by the culprit to facilitate his escape. McCue's own declaration that he had seen his assailant, and that he looked like a dirty white man, was given to the jury, not by the accused, but by those to whom he had told his story. It was partly to investigate this theory that the jury visited the McCue house to satisfy itself that it was possible for a fugitive to escape from the house through Ruby McCue's room across the porch roof to a tree that stands on that side of the house, and thence to the ground. The prosecution showed that a pot of ferns had stood for some time and was still in this window on the morning following the murder, and that at that time there were cobwebs for the space of some twelve inches on one side of the opening. Witness also deposed that, while it was possible for a man to reach this tree, neither the porch roof nor the tree afforded any evidence that any one had escaped that way. Among the unusual incidents of this sensational trial was the holding of court, twice during its progress, in private residences; once in the house in which the tragedy occurred, and later in the home of Dr. F. C. McCue. None of the accessories of a complete court were lacking. There were present in each instance, judge, jury, counsel, clerk, sergeant, prisoner, and court stenographers. These, with the reporters, constituted the full-fledged "residential tribunals." It was six weeks after J. Samuel McCue had left his home under arrest that he saw it again for the first time. He was the chief figure in the little court assemblage that met in the McCue residence on the afternoon of October 25th, for the purpose of viewing the scenes of the tragedy. For hours before he had been sitting in a dusty, densely packed court-room, listening to the evidence of the two physicians as they related the gruesome story of his wife's murder and told of the wounds and of the blood which had flowed from them. There had lain, almost within his grasp, the bloody base-ball bat, the gun, the bathroom rug, his own blood-stained and torn undershirt, and, most terrible of all, the nightgown of his dead wife, a garment stiff with blood, and so stained that it looked as if it had been dyed in maroon. And yet, when the prisoner came face to face with a hundred and one reminders of the wife whom he claims to have loved with a tender devotion, witnessed the home in which as father and husband he must have spent many happy hours, and heard the voices of the loved ones from whom a cruel fate, or a just decree, was separating him, he stood entirely unmoved. Not a single tear was shed and not a shade of a shadow of emotion was evinced. For the most of the time, as he went from room to room, when all others had removed their hats, he stood with hands folded across his breast and his hat tilted back on his head to the very verge of falling. He was jaunty, defiant— quietly indifferent—but not emotioned. He saw again the bed-chamber in which Fannie McCue received her first wounds, and heard unmoved Captain Woods' invitation to the jury to look into the chiffonier mirror and decide whether it was possible for the accused to have seen through it the approach of "a dirty-looking white man." Down the narrow hall—the pathway of the fleeing wife—he walked with steady step and head erect, and looked again into the bathroom where the body of the murdered woman a few short weeks before had lain, but gave no sign of nervousness, of grief, or of regret. He viewed more calmly than did the jurors from distant parts of the State, the old-fashioned bed on which the body had been placed, and when he had reluctantly gone to look upon it, preferring to remember "her as when alive." This was the McCue of iron. Another day, possibly the last on which he will look upon his home, he went again with judge and jury to examine the avenues of escape for the supposed burglar. Two trees—a locust by the kitchen porch and a giant oak that stands north of the parlor—were the mute, unsworn witnesses examined. The locust tree testified that a burglar could have escaped by way of the back porch roof and its branches; the oak stood out strong for the prosecution. On this occasion, although the accused simply walked around the house, and heard the rustle of the dead leaves under the great oak tree, he wiped a tear from each eye. And, later, when the "movable court" stopped at the residence of Dr. F. C. McCue to take the testimony of the latter's wife, there was something in the scenes and incidents of the occasion, which caused the prisoner to give way to grief. This was the McCue of tears and tenderness. Among the odds and ends of testimony which have not fitted into the narrative previously must be listed some of McCue's life insurance policies, which the defense introduced because Mrs. McCue was the beneficiary of most of them. The prosecution took occasion to say that the policies were useful as collateral. First policy is for $15,000, dated March 15, 1904, payable to McCue's estate. Northwestern Mutual Life, Milwaukee. Second, Equitable Life, dated March 2, 1903, for $10,000; payable to his wife. After three years the company will "make loans" on policy. Third, New York Life Company, $10,000. October 16, 1893, payable to Mrs. McCue. Fourth, accident and health policy, Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company, $5,000, in favor of Mrs. McCue. This policy was good for $10,000 if death occurred on a railroad. All these policies were payable to the heirs, assigns, etc., of Mr. McCue in the event of Mrs. McCue's death prior to that of the accused. Travelers Insurance Company, Hartford, Conn., February 2, 1903, for $20,000. Name of prisoner in this contract is written James S. McCue. This policy has a loan value, and at any time assured could change beneficiary. Sixth, for $5,000, Life Insurance Company of Virginia, dated February 21, 1903. This policy also has a loan surrender value. It was payable to wife of accused. Seventh, Royal Arcanum benefit certificate, $3,000, dated April 10, 1896, in favor of Mrs. McCue. This policy could not be made payable to any person but the assured's wife. Eighth, Fidelity Mutual Life, Philadelphia, dated June 8, 1897, $10,000, in favor of Mrs. McCue. Mr. Lee here stated that there were one or two other policies, but that he would not delay the court to consider them. Whether the defense would put their client on the witness stand to testify in his own behalf was a matter of uncertainty until his lawyers announced that they had no more evidence to submit. An interesting story got into circulation in some way, but has never been confirmed. According to this rumor the prisoner was very anxious to testify. His leading attorney, Mr. Lee, was opposed to his doing so, while his colleagues sided with the accused. It was agreed among the lawyers that they would privately hear McCue's version of the matter, and that after he had finished his statement, Mr. Lee should cross-question him for five minutes. The end of it all was that the prisoner was not given the opportunity to contradict the damaging evidence of John S. White, Ernest Crawford, and some others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. INSTRUCTIONS. The evidence all in, there was nothing between the jury and its entire control of the case, except the instructions of the court and the argument of counsel. The instructions are given here, and the argument in succeeding chapters. After a few hours' conference between counsel for prisoner and those representing Commonwealth and Judge Morris, the following instructions were given for the guidance of the jury: "The court instructs the jury that in all criminal prosecutions a man has a right to be confronted with his accuser and the witnesses against him, and no statement made by any witness or other person, elsewhere than in the court and in the presence of the accused, constitutes evidence against him. The sole purpose for which evidence, if any such statement is admitted, or for which it can be used, is to enable the jury to judge whether or not the witness is entitled to credit. The court instructs the jury that the law presumes every person charged with crime to be innocent until his guilt is established by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt, and this presumption of innocence goes with the accused through the entire case and applies at every stage thereof; and if, after having heard all of the evidence in this case, the jury have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused upon the whole case, or as to any fact, essential to prove the charge made against him in the indictment, it is their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty. The court further instructs the jury that upon the trial of this case, if a reasonable doubt of any fact necessary to establish the guilt of accused as charged in the indictment be raised by the evidence or lack of evidence, such doubt is decisive and the jury must acquit the accused since a verdict of "not guilty" means no more than that the guilt of the accused has not been established in the precise, specific and narrow form prescribed by law. The court instructs the jury that when upon a charge of murder, the evidence is wholly circumstantial, as is the case here, the absence of all evidence of an inducing cause or motive to commit the offence charged affords of itself a strong presumption of innocence. The court instructs the jury that murder by poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, or any wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or in the commission of, or attempt to commit arson, rape, robbery, or burglary is murder of the first degree. All other murder is murder of the second degree. The court instructs the jury that in the application of circumstantial evidence to the determination of the case, the utmost caution and vigilance should be used. Such evidence is always insufficient where assuming all to be true, which the evidence tends to prove, some other reasonable hypothesis may still be true, for it is the actual exclusion ALBEMARLE COUNTY COURT-ROOM. of every other reasonable hypothesis which invests mere circumstances with the force of truth. Where the evidence leaves it indifferent, which is several hypothesis is true, or establishes only same finite probability of one hypothesis, such cannot amount to proof, however great the probability may be. And the court further instructs the jury that all the evidence in this case which tends to establish that the accused is guilty of the crime which he is charged, is circumstantial and not positive evidence. Therefore, although the jury may believe from the evidence in this case that there is a strong probability that the accused is guilty of the offence charged in the indictment, still, if upon the whole evidence, there is any other reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence they cannot find the accused guilty, and this is true, although it may appear from the evidence that the probabilities of his guilt are greater than the probabilities of his innocence. The court instructs the jury, even if they are satisfied from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused took the life of the deceased, then the jury are instructed that the law presumes prima facie that such killing was murder of the second degree, and the burden rests upon the Commonwealth to elevate the offense to murder in the first degree, by proving beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of that crime as defined by another instruction. The court instructs the jury that even though they may believe from the evidence that the witnesses, William McCue and John Perry, may have made statements in conflict with or in contradiction of the evidence given by them on the witness stand, in considering the guilt or innocence of the accused, of the crime with which he is charged, the jury are not at liberty to take into consideration any such contradictory or conflicting statements of the said witnesses, or either of them, but must consider the case of the accused as if such statements had never been made, except that they may consider such statements for the sole purpose of determining whether said witnesses, or either of them, are worthy of belief. "Offered by the Commonwealth:" The court instructs the jury that a reasonable doubt is such a doubt as may be honestly and reasonably entertained as to any substantial and material fact essential to prove the offense charged. Reasonable doubt must be based upon the evidence, or that suggested by the evidence, or grows out of the evidence itself. It must not be arbitrary doubt, without evidence to sustain it. It must be serious and substantial in order to warrant an acquittal. It must be a doubt of material fact or facts necessary for the jury to believe to find a verdict of conviction, and not of immaterial and nonessential circumstances. The court further instructs the jury that circumstantial evidence is legal and competent in criminal cases, and if it is of such a character as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that the defendant is guilty, is entitled to the same weight as direct testimony. The court further instructs the jury that a mortal wound, given with a deadly weapon, in the previous possession of the slayer, without any provocation, or even with slight provocation, is prima facie wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, and throws upon the prisoner the necessity of showing extenuating circumstances. The court further instructs the jury that to constitute a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, it is not necessary the intention to kill should exist any particular length of time prior to the actual killing. It is only necessary that such intention should come into existence for the first time at the time of killing, or any time previously. The court further instructs the jury that the rule of law is that a man shall be taken to intend that which he does, or which is the necessary consequence of his act. The court further instructs the jury, as a matter of law, that in considering the case the jury are not to go beyond the evidence to hunt up doubts, nor must they entertain such doubts as are merely chimerical or conjectural. A doubt, to justify an acquittal, must be reasonable doubt, and it must arise from a candid and impartial investigation of all the evidence in the case; and unless it is such that the same kind of doubt in the reposed in the graver transaction of life, it would cause a reasonable and prudent man to hesitate and pause, it is insufficient to authorize a verdict of not guilty. If, after considering all the evidence, you can say that you have an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the other hand, the jury must not go beyond the evidence to hunt up inferences of guilt. The court instructs the jury that whoever kills a human being with malice aforethought is guilty of murder; that a murder which is perpetrated by a person lying in wait, or any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, is murder in the first degree. The court instructs the jury that on a charge of murder, malice is presumed from the fact of killing. When the killing is proved and is unaccompanied with circumstances of palliation, the burden of disproving malice is thrown upon the accused. The court instructs the jury that murder is distinguished by the law of Virginia as murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. The court further instructs the jury that every homicide in Virginia is presumed in law to be murder in the second degree. In order to elevate the offense to murder in the first degree, the burden of proof is upon the Commonwealth, and to reduce the offense to manslaughter, the burden of proof is upon the prisoner. The court further instructs the jury that whenever the killing is wilful, deliberate and premeditated, the law infers malice from this fact. The court instructs the jury that the credulity of witnesses is a question exclusively for the jury, and the law is that where a number of witnesses testify directly opposite to each other, the jury is not bound to regard the weight of the evidence as equally balanced; the jury have the right to determine from the appearance of the witnesses on the stand, their manner of testifying and their apparent candor and fairness, their apparent intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and from all the other surrounding circumstances appearing on the trial which witnesses are more worthy of credit and to give credit accordingly. The court further instructs the jury that in determining the weight to be given the testimony of different witnesses in any case, the jury are authorized to consider the relationship of the witnesses to the parties, if the same is proved; their interests of any in the result of this case; their temper, feeling or bias, if any has been shown; their demeanor whilst testifying; their apparent intelligence and their means of information, and to give such credit to the testimony of such witnesses as under all the circumstances such witness seem to be entitled. The jury are finally instructed that the instructions given are all the instructions of the court, and must be considered as a whole. The court instructs the jury that all the statements made by John Perry and J. William McCue to other persons, not in the presence of the accused, can only be considered by the jury for the purpose of discrediting the said William McCue and the said John Perry, and the jury are instructed that such statement should not be considered by them as evidence against the accused, but only for the purpose above stated, and said statements should be considering the question of guilt or innocence of the accused, and be wholly disregarded by the jury and treated as if they had never been made. The court instructs the jury that where evidence is adduced of any statement of the accused, such statement must be considered as a whole. A part of it cannot be considered and a part rejected. The jury must consider all or none; and if the prosecutor uses the declaration of the prisoner, he must take the whole together, and cannot select one part and leave another. The court instructs the jury that if, upon the whole evidence in the case, there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused, they must find him not guilty. The court instructs the jury that the failure of the evidence to disclose any other criminal agent than the accused, is not a circumstance, which may be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he was guilty of the crime wherewith he is charged. The prisoner is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established, and he is not to be prejudiced by the inability of the Commonwealth to point any other criminal agent, nor is he called upon to vindicate his own innocence by naming the guilty person. The court instructs the jury that, upon the trial of a criminal case by a jury, the law contemplates the concurrence of twelve minds in the conclusion of guilt before a conviction can be had. Each individual juror must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt before he can, under his oath, consent to a verdict of guilty. Each juror should feel the responsibility resting upon him as a member of the jury, and should realize that his own mind must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt before he can consent to a verdict of guilty. Therefore, if any individual member of the jury, after having duly considered all of the evidence in this case, and after consultation with his fellow-jurors, should entertain such reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt, as set forth in certain instructions in this case, it is his duty not to surrender his own convictions, simply because the balance of the jury entertain different convictions. The court instructs the jury that upon the trial of a criminal case by a jury, the law contemplates a concurrence of twelve minds in the conclusion of guilt before a conviction can be had. Not only is this true with respect to the guilt of the accused, but it is likewise true with respect to the degree of the crime. Therefore, although the jury may believe from the evidence that the accused is guilty of the killing of the deceased, still if any individual member of the jury, after having duly considered all of the evidence in this case, and after a consultation with his fellow-jurors should entertain a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused, it is his duty not to surrender his own convictions as to such degree of guilt simply because the balance of the jury entertain convictions with respect to such degree. CAPT. MICAJAH WOODS, Associated with Commonwealth's Attorney in Prosecution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. CAPT. WOODS' SPEECH FOR PROSECUTION. Certainly no more remarkable murder trial has ever taken place in the ancient court-room at Charlottesville. It was a remarkably foul and revolting crime, it matters not who committed it. If the husband, instead of being the model citizen, thoughtful, and affectionate husband and tender father, was in reality a degenerate capable of brutally mangling and murdering the wife of his bosom, the case gains in its marked difference from any other ever submitted to a jury in Virginia. The prisoner while on trial constantly vibrated from one extreme state of mind to another. At one moment he gave way freely and frankly to tears, making no effort to restrain them; at the next he was indifferent, stolid and apparently unfeeling. He had tender kisses for his little girl and other children, and seemed deeply concerned for their welfare and happiness; he allowed, if he did not require them, to sit through the most harrowing scenes in court. In another respect he fixed a practice that became a daily spectacle. He kissed his brothers on meeting them, and when his lady relatives came into court to lend him the comfort and support of their presence, he invariably embraced and kissed them twice or thrice. The next moment he would look on coldly while the blood-stained garments of his wife were displayed as accusing exhibits in the effort to send him to the gallows. On the morning of Wednesday, November 2d, a vast crowd assembled at the court-house, even before the doors had been opened. By the use of tact, and taking advantage of the courtesy which never fails the Virginia gentleman in his conduct towards them, the ladies all got comfortable seats in the galleries. The lower floor was speedily crowded with men of all professions and in all stations of life, but a large number were unable to gain entrance. It was a quiet audience, as all the gatherings had been, for two reasons—first, a desire to hear with respectful demeanor all that was said; and, second, because Judge Morris' dignity dominated. For all his thirty years of experience, Captain Woods had never before faced a responsibility so grave and delicate, or with such high expectations on the part of the public. His success was probably the greatest triumph of his whole professional career. Every demand of good feeling and good taste was met in a manner so successful that many will remember his speech as the most powerful they have ever heard. "May it please the court," said Captain Woods, "and you gentlemen, I come before you this morning to perform the most important and the most delicate and the most responsible function that has ever confronted me in my life. "I feel that the responsibility that has been put upon my shoulders this morning is almost equal to that which rests upon each one of you. You may well conceive that, having known this accused ever since he came to this bar long years ago, between whom and myself the relations have always been agreeable and pleasant, between whose people and mine there has been no difference—you may well conceive that the burden upon my heart is a heavy one. "I came here in no spirit of persecution. Would to God that the evidence in this case had allowed a reasonable doubt for the escape of the prisoner at the bar. Had this evidence relieved him, there is none who would have more warmly congratulated him than I. "I come here under the compulsion of the people of this section of the Commonwealth, not to deal harshly for the purpose of victory, but to so conduct this case that the ends of justice may be served. I hope that these gentlemen who represent the accused will give him the benefit of every reasonable doubt that this evidence can possibly raise. The people of this grand old Commonwealth desire no innocent man to be punished. However damnable the crime may be, the man accused of it is entitled to all the safeguards of the law. I would rather have my tongue cleave to my mouth, or my right arm wither in its socket than think that anything I had said unjustly or unfairly resulted in the conviction of this prisoner. With the distinguished gentlemen who represent the other side, I beg you to give to him the full benefit of any doubt. But, after all, gentlemen, the responsibility is with you. To-day, under this clear sky, you are the twelve pillars in the temple of justice." Here the speaker in thrilling language described the crime. Then he added: "Ever since that the one cry has been, `Discover who it is that is guilty of this foul and unnatural murder. Discover who it is that has slaughtered this noble and loyal wife.' "There is not a man or woman in this land who is not interested in the result of this case. "You know as well as I do that the position of this accused is a terrible one—an awful one. While I personally have a regard for the accused which is the result of long friendship, yet I say in the presence of my God that I shall do my duty, even though he were the richest and most powerful man in the Commonwealth. I have no sympathy for the fiendish and brutal murderer of Fannie Crawford McCue." At this point, as there was some tendency to applaud the speaker, the judge warned the audience that he would promptly check any attempt to make a demonstration. "The man who hit the deceased with a bat and put his murderous fingers on her throat, and later pointed a gun at her pure bosom, is as guilty as any dastardly murderer that ever dangled from a rope. There can be but two issues—it is either life or death." Referring to the circumstances of the crime, the speaker added: "It was a warm evening and at an hour when there should have been thoughts of heaven and higher things; it was immediately after the ministers of the land had uttered the most sacred truths." He ridiculed the possibility that a burglar seeking booty should await in a house until the master and mistress returned; should then, all unarmed, walk into a lighted room and attack the man and woman; should finally have killed the wife and injured the husband, and then have left without touching a thing in the house. "When you come to reason about this matter," added Captain Woods, "you have to apply common sense—the same reason as you apply to any personal matter of great concern. Don't you know that if any man had any grudge against the accused, he never would have gone unarmed to the house—entered unarmed at such an hour. No outsider who hated Mr. or Mrs. McCue would have dared to go to a lighted house, as people walked the streets. The assassin goes stealthily at the midnight hour. He goes with the bludgeon in his hand. You can't get around that fact; remember, the murder was committed about 9:30 o'clock, and that he who killed carried no weapon with him, but found them all ready to hand. If he had come with such a fiendish purpose, he would never have arrived at such a time, in the presence of such a strong, vigorous man as the accused, and at a time when he was so liable to be aroused. No assassin draws out such a crime with `linked cruelty.' It would have been quick and sudden. It was after the assault with the weapon and the beating that the shot was fired. It was to conceal the early work of anger. `Murder, though it has no tongue, speaks with most miraculous voice.' A person may lie, but circumstances all linked together will establish a fact as strong as proof of holy writ. The law presumes all murder as prompted by malice. You heard the account given by Ernest Crawford of the domestic conditions in the McCue household, of the quarrels and threats and accusations. To refute his statements of an unhappy home there were brought in letters, but one of which was written in the year 1901. Not one of you gentlemen could have failed to have been touched by the tender sentiments of the letters of the deceased. Those letters, for tenderness and purity and love, could not have been surpassed. "If I perform my duty to the womanhood of this State, to the manhood of the State and to my conscience, I must deal with this case fearlessly. But, gentlemen of the jury," cried Captain Woods, "you must not fail to recall one thing. Those letters were written several years ago. There were a number of them in 1899 and 1900, and but one—gentlemen, observe this, but one—in 1901. Not a letter after this date has been introduced. Were there any to introduce? I do not know. If there were any, they offered the best opportunity for showing to you gentlemen what were the relations between this man and wife. Gentlemen, where are they? Not a letter has been introduced since 1901. They were proper as evidence. If there were letters, why were they kept back?" With great politeness, Mr. Lee regretted to interrupt Mr. Woods. "We did not think it would be necessary to bring in any more letters,' Mr. Lee said. "We have a stack of them feet high. We will read them all to this jury if you wish. Please go out after the letters, Mr. Walker.' "Just a minute, if you please," said Captain Woods, in effect. "The injection of evidence at this time has been expressly forestalled by the court. You know all along that the letters were proper as evidence. Why did you not introduce them before?" After a brief absence, Mr. Walker returned with a packet of letters. Captain Woods proceeded with his speech. "Fortunately, there is evidence in this case which throws a flood of light upon the relations between the prisoner and his wife. Outside the testimony of Ernest Crawford, there is abundant evidence to show an unhappy home. What did Miss Berta Crawford say? She was a younger sister of the deceased, had various opportunities of seeing the relations between husband and wife, was at the home a week before the murder. Prisoner treated his wife most unkindly; told of absence of husband for a week, and his indifference to her and to her illness upon his return. When she asked the prisoner where he had been, he said she `had nothing to do with his trip.' The actions of the prisoner were not what they should have been. They were cold and indifferent. No greeting to the wife, the mother of his children, after an absence of a week; only harshness and indifference. This was just one week before the tragedy. Let us see what Ernest Crawford heard between these persons when he was living in the house. `It was the most unhappy home I ever saw,' said he; `the quarrels between them were always "about other women." One of the most violent quarrels was because of a trip down in the pasture lot with another woman.' His wife called his attention to other compromising situations; once when she went to his office and found him locked in with another woman, and when he came to the door he looked `sheepish.' " Captain Woods here referred in terms of scathing sarcasm to the effort of the defense to picture the "happy relations" existing between Mr. and Mrs. McCue. He said that people of respectable station do not quarrel in public places and on the public streets. Domestic discord is kept strictly secret; is kept within the sacred precincts of the home, where the outside world cannot see or hear. In this connection, Captain Woods quoted the testimony of W. W. Brand, a respected Charlottesville citizen, who swore he had heard the accused address his wife in the roughest language—"like he would have killed her in a second." "If you are gentle and kind to women," added the speaker, "you will have little trouble, but if you are rough, their hearts are wrung. Tell me this man had any love in his heart for that frail little woman, his wife, when he spoke to her `as if he would have killed her in a minute.' "Gentlemen, this loving wife, this mother of his children and mistress of his home, had gone to the bourne from which no traveller returns. Her spirit had winged its way to a celestial home. Her body was cold and still in death. And what did he do? Did he strike down the one that spoke slightingly of her? Did he refer to her with tenderness and love? No, gentlemen of the jury, he called her `that woman,' and he called her jealous. Gentlemen, he said, that four or five years his life had been a `perfect hell'!" McCue was straining forward in his chair. His eyes were fixed intently upon Captain Woods. He moved uneasily from place to place on the chair. When Captain Woods had finished this picture of the relations of the couple, he proceeded to vindicate what he called straws that pointed to other phases of the relations between McCue and his wife. Looked upon as isolated facts, they meant little; reckoned in connection with what had gone before and what came after, they meant much. Among these straws were a half-dozen little incidents—the failure of McCue to walk to church that night with his wife; their attitude toward each other afterwards; the depression of Mrs. McCue while on her way back home, and other things. "Mr. McCue had been away from home from Thursday or Friday before and reached home in the afternoon of that Sunday. His wife, with her little daughter Ruby, had also been on a visit to Mrs. Anderson, near Red Hill, in this county, and had reached home an hour or so ahead of her husband. Mark you, they had been absent, and he had before been on one of his trips (sarcastic tone here). "Living on this earth there is no one who knows what happened but husband and wife in that interval—up to the time of the supper— but we have had testimony in this case as to what happened just after that supper. Here was this man, who has since stated that his life was a hell on earth with `this woman,' as he called her. Here was dark night, and it was nearly 8 o'clock. What do you find at that house then? The evidence has indicated that this husband permitted his wife to leave that home all by herself to walk up the street in the dark. She was seen alone. She wandered along alone and without the protecting arm of her husband. They had been separated for days, and yet that lady went from that house alone on that street—a dark night and nearly 8 o'clock—without her natural protector and her guardian. I care not what may have happened. It is one of the elements in this case that have to be considered. Think of it, this frail woman leaving her home by herself ahead of her husband. There must have been something wrong there at that time. I know not how it may be at the McCue home, but I know how it is in other homes in this Commonwealth. Women are not permitted to go alone squares and squares in the dark to worship their God." After this Captain Woods went on to picture the happenings of the night of the homicide. He pointed to the husband and the wife entering the house together. It was the last time she was seen alive. He called attention to the significance of this interval between the time McCue and his wife entered the house and the time his brother, the physician, was seen to enter. What did it not mean to the woman? It meant life itself. And what of her husband? "There under the roof with his wife he was her sole protector and guardian. He must be held responsible for her safety. Gentlemen, unless he was senseless from a blow, unless his physical condition was such that he could not go to her aid; gentlemen, unless body and mind were alike insensible, then he murdered her himself as certain as the sun rose or God created the earth." Captain Woods read the testimony of Charles Skinner, the negro in the Moran lot, who heard the screams and later the shot. This, he contended, proves that Mrs. McCue did not come to a sudden death; that she begged and pleaded for her life. "Is it conceivable that a burglar would linger over his victim in this way—torture her, and risk detection and the recovery of the man said to have been insensible upon the floor? No; a husband, in the privacy of his own home, was inflamed by wrath. To him had come the thought that he could now rid himself of this woman, who had by her jealousy made his `life a hell.' He had struck her—cruelly struck her. His murderous fingers had closed about her tender throat. Leisurely he went about his task. She pleaded for mercy, but in vain. With a full purpose still unsubdued, he followed her to her hiding-place and then shot her down. The gun was his own. Loaded or unloaded, when he picked it up it was his, and he had fired it. The man who killed Mrs. McCue that night had gone to a point from which he could not retreat, and shot her to conceal the evidence of his brutality, since no man would believe him, a person of the standing and respectability of the accused, guilty. "Suppose he had been knocked temporarily senseless? There was necessarily but a few minutes which could have elapsed before he recovered. The first impulse of every true man would have been to raise an alarm. Why was there no hue and outcry? Why this secrecy, if those in the house were guiltless of any crime? The neighbors were upon their porches. The night was warm and the windows were open. "A single outcry for help would have brought a dozen strong arms to the rescue. The first instinct of human nature, if innocence were there, would have been to cry down the felon, to summon the friends, who would gladly have come to their aid. "Was it done?" asked Captain Woods, in effect. "No! I tell you, gentlemen, that to me this is the strongest and most remarkable feature of this case if the accused is not guilty. I tell you—it is my duty to tell you, and I do not care where the blow will fall—that if he had been innocent that night the threat of cannon or the stare of death itself could not have stopped him from crying aloud to those who would help him find the murderer of his wife. "If his brother had found the conditions testified to—his brother struck and his sister killed—unless he had found that the brother had stained his hands in his wife's blood, you couldn't have stopped him from raising a hue and cry—from seeking to catch the infernal felon who had slaughtered a noble woman." After the recess for dinner, Captain Woods resumed. Every inch of space in the court-house was again filled by eager listeners. "I must remind you that I was talking of the conditions at that house immediately after the tragedy. "You will remember in that connection that soon after the first person reached the house after Mr. Grady had arrived and the hue and cry had been raised, Willie McCue arrived. You will remember that Mrs. Massie came about this time, and also others, and that Willie McCue, on hearing that the mother who had nurtured him was dead, gave way to grief. I do not intend—I would not if I could—do my conscience the injustice to stand here before this public and make any attack on that boy. "On fourteen important matters he has been contradicted by independent witnesses. I do not count the detectives. He, indeed, was `fighting the battle of his life,' as he has well said. By a stronger one than I—by a mind perhaps more quick, by one with a greater sense of the dramatic than I—he perhaps was told that his father was standing on the scaffold near the trap-door, and that if he were to repeat what he told the Baldwins and Ernest Crawford, he would spring the trap and would send the father to his death. "It was a dark and terrible and an awful position for Willie McCue. His mother was gone beyond recall. No human power could vitalize her body. The one dearest to him in life, the mother who loved him better than she loved her own life, had been taken away by a foul and felonious hand. "I think that what he may have done in this case should provoke sorrow and pity rather than abuse and vituperation. I believe that in that final hour, when he shall be judged at the bar of the Creator, the recording angel will drop a tear upon this incident of his life, and I trust he may be forgiven. He wrote what came from his heart to that aunt in Atlanta. Surrounded by his uncles, he was fighting the battle of his life, for he loved his mother better than his life, and when, according to the testimony of Jailer Nat Martin, he was in the prison with his father, and the latter sought to induce him to deny that he (Willie) had seen the accused pursue his wife with pistol, then, too, the battle of his life was upon him. "His father's life was involved in the answer, and yet at that time he was under the control of the influence of a better spirit, and stuck to the truth." Willie McCue heard Captain Woods as nonchalantly as his father; indeed, he was the more untouched of the two. "Now, gentlemen, there is the fact testified to by an independent witness, Jailer Martin. I make no comment on what the brothers of the accused said about this colloquy. "If I had been there I would have tried to hear so vital a statement. It seems to me that I would have prayed to the great God who resides above to arouse the memory of that conversation. I make no attack upon them, but it is my duty to bring your attention to this condition of things. I will say that this accused behind the bar has as respectable, as honorable kinsmen as any that walk the soil of the Commonwealth of Virginia. They are friends of mine. But I must do my duty, and do it regardless of consequences, and look to my people and my God to vindicate men. "If the accused was in his senses, he was charged with the responsibility of his wife's protection," said Captain Woods. "Let us see if he was insensible. Dr. McCue says he was dazed when he got there. Yet the accused had sense enough to `'phone to his brother' instead of giving a public alarm, and Dr. McCue went to the house of the accused that night without telling any one of what had happened. The accused had sense enough to call his brother, and not the police, and to call an old man, half a mile away, over the 'phone. "But wait. Through a telephone girl the police had been notified. Grady at the head of his men burst into the house and took them by surprise. `The cat was out of the bag.' The scheming and preparation was stopped half-finished. In his confusion the murderer told a half dozen different tales. His brother tried to make him go upstairs before he talked too much." Captain Woods read seven different accounts given by the prisoner of the occurrences in the house on the night of the murder. "An innocent man," declared the speaker, "would at once have stated the truth—the plain, unvarnished tale—and this would have been his story from first to last. He would have needed no preparations." He held up the bloody shirt and pointed to the blood spots on the back. He drew a vivid picture of the wife fighting for her life and leaving on the shirt the tell-tale marks of blood. He called attention to the broken finger-nail and the incident of the scrap torn from the shirt. He also remarked upon the fact that the accused did not go near the body of his wife until she was in her coffin. He read from the testimony of Mrs. Massie that when she saw McCue on the night of the murder the sleeves of his shirt were rolled above his elbows. The speaker declared that the blood of his wife stained those hidden wristbands; that the murderer had even then just come from the bath-tub, where he had tried to wash them away. "You might say, if in the transport of grief, he had taken the body of his murdered wife in his arms, that in this way the blood got on his shirt; but the evidence is unanimous on the point that not once did he go to where the body was until it was in the casket. Cruel and indifferent when in life, he was equally indifferent after her death." In concluding, Captain Woods made a strong, earnest, noble appeal to the jury. He said: "Now, gentlemen of the jury, I think in justice to the accused and taxing your patience, also, that I have given this case a fair opening. The issues of life and death are involved here. Here was one of the noble women of the Commonwealth, entitled to the shield of every honest hand and every gallant heart; she had been taken rudely and foully by practically an assassin's hand—not only taken with a sudden blow, which would have sent her to her God, without any of those horrible features of suffering and the horrid anticipation, but as a feline catches and nurses the poor helpless mouse in its claws; she was played with about the throat, she was struck about the head; she was then, after an interval, shot with her husband's gun. Murder, at best, is bad, is foul; but this was most foul, strange and unnatural, and I but voice the feeling that must stir in every honest bosom; I but voice the feeling of every citizen of this Commonwealth when I say that with such circumstances as these— pointing with all the concentrated rage towards the prisoner at the bar—that you cannot escape your duty. "The great public of Virginia ask for nothing but justice—they ask that you take this case and conscientiously consider every question and every point pertaining to it. It is the highest function and the gravest duty of your life. The great Commonwealth that we love, with our brave people, ask in no spirit of vengeance for one of its citizen's blood, but it asks that murder shall be punished. The great King of Kings upon the tablets, which have come to us from remote ages, from Mt. Sinai, wrote in living words, "Thou shalt not murder; thou shalt do no murder," and all that is asked of you, gentlemen, is, without prejudice against the accused, without bias, one way or the other, to hold in your consciences and in your minds, the scales of justice. "Figure and think, and as sensible men passing upon one, perhaps the gravest of all subjects that your mind was ever drawn to, if you shall reach a conclusion in your minds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this accused is guilty, I say to you in behalf of the women of this Commonwealth, one of whom has been stricken and murdered; I say to you in behalf of the men of this State, who shiver with horror at such an outrage; I say to you in behalf of humanity itself, that he deserves the highest and most condign punishment that human hands can inflict. "I am about to leave this case in your hands, and I feel deeply the responsibility—I feel for each one of you. I have felt this strain beyond measure; I feel almost that something has gone out of my very life in the management of this case, and yet I have been taught, and I have tried to act in my life that when a duty was imposed upon me, and that when I undertook to perform it, I did so fearlessly, and boldly, and broadly, and freely in the presence of man and God. Gentlemen, all that we ask is justice in behalf of the people, and I trust that, when you retire and have given consideration to all the eloquence and all the views that will be presented to you, that you will remember that facts are stronger than theories, that justice is stronger than mercy, and that, though the heavens fall, you should do your duty. I trust that you may be blessed by God in your deliberations, and that when you bring in your verdict, your conscience will say, `Faithful,' and that when you all go to meet your God and give a last account of your works, that God will say, `Well done, faithful and true.' Gentlemen, I thank you." At one time in the course of his argument Captain Woods, under the guise of paying a handsome compliment to the rhetorical ability of Mr. Coleman and the persuasiveness of Mr. Lee, found opportunity to anticipate the supposed arguments of the defense, and then, with a merry twinkle in his eye, Captain Woods slyly added that Mr. Lee could swim in the blood of all the innocent people whose deaths had gone unavenged through his eloquence. G. BURNLEY SINCLAIR, Of Counsel for Defense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. MR. SINCLAIR SPEAKS FOR DEFENSE. One of the largest crowds which assembled in the court-room during the trial was that of the first night session, held on the evening of November 2d, when Mr. G. B. Sinclair made the opening speech for the defense. After complimenting the jury on the patient consideration it had given the case, Mr. Sinclair proceeded at once to the discussion of the points involved. Arguing from the viewpoint of the instructions, Mr. Sinclair pointed out the law governing circumstantial evidence. He closely followed the line laid down by the court, declaring that all circumstantial evidence is insufficient when assuming all to be true, while the evidence tends to prove some other reasonable hypothesis may still be true. It is the actual exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis which interests men—circumstances with the face of truth. Although the jury may believe from the evidence in the case that there is a strong probability that the accused is guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, still, if upon the whole evidence there is any other reasonable hypothesis, consistent with his innocence, they cannot find the accused guilty. And this is true, although it may appear from the evidence that the probabilities of his guilt are greater than the probabilities of his innocence. Diverging from this line of argument, Mr. Sinclair declared that the defense was prepared to prove that the Commonwealth, with all its effort and all the money it has spent, has succeeded in establishing but one indisputable fact—that on the night of September 4th Fannie Crawford McCue, wife of the prisoner, was brutally murdered in her own home. Beyond this, the Commonwealth had not gone. "We are willing to admit," said Mr. Sinclair, "that there are circumstances which point to Mr. McCue, but at the same time these circumstances are entirely consistent with his innocence." Proceeding, the attorney for the defense outlined the case of the prosecution, declaring that it based its contention mainly upon three points—the bad relations existing between the man and wife, the conditions at the house pointing to the husband, and the contradictory statements of the accused. The motive was found in the alleged bad relations. Whether or not the Commonwealth had established this motive, the jury would have to decide. Mr. Sinclair said, in passing, that even bad relations did not presuppose murder, and that even a blow was not always followed by a homicide. The testimony of the Commonwealth was then taken up and discussed, point by point, by Mr. Sinclair. The speaker ridiculed what Captain Woods had called "straws"—the little incidents in the recent life of McCue and his wife held to indicate the strained character of the relations between the two. Brand, Thomas, Stevens and many others came in for a few flings. It was Ernest Crawford, however, that Mr. Sinclair gave the lion's share of his attention. He made a terrific assault upon the young man, and laughed at his testimony as a whole, laying particular emphasis upon what he considered the absurdity of the statement that a man of McCue's standing should "go down in the pasture lot," or that a woman of Mrs. McCue's standing would in the presence of a third person charge her husband with doing such a thing; in fact, Mr. Sinclair said that the Commonwealth had utterly and ignominously failed to besmirch the character of the accused. "Not a breath nor a word has been brought against him," he declared. "In spite of the announcement of the Commonwealth that all ladies should stay away from a recent session, nothing was done, and Mr. McCue's character stands here to-day immaculate and spotless as ever. This investigation has served only to show how spotless and immaculate it is. We must be fair, gentlemen—fair and honest." For the next ten or fifteen minutes Mr. Sinclair devoted his attention to the alleged bad relations existing between the accused and his dead wife. He declared that here again the Commonwealth had failed. The speaker cited first the letters of the man and wife, and then the testimony of a half dozen or more witnesses, all of whom had declared that they had never observed anything but the utmost cordiality between the two. The attorney laid strong emphasis upon the life insurance carried by the defendant for the benefit of his wife. This insurance amounted to $70,000 or more, and Mr. Sinclair figured roughly that it cost the money-loving McCue $2,500 a year or possibly as much as $10 a day to maintain this insurance, "and yet," cried Mr. Sinclair, "this is the man the Commonwealth claims was on bad terms with his wife and actually killed her." Reference was next made by Mr. Sinclair to the alleged conversation in the jail between the prisoner and Mr. John S. White, in the course of which Mr. McCue is said to have declared that for the past four or five years his life had been a perfect hell; that "that woman is the most jealous woman I have ever known." The speaker analyzed this alleged conversation, and after calling attention to the possibility of a misunderstanding, he quoted the instruction of the court, declaring "that where evidence is adduced of any statement of the accused, such statement must be considered as a whole; a part of it cannot be considered and a part rejected; the jury must consider all or none." This quotation was given in connection with the statement of Mr. White that throughout the conversation Mr. McCue had spoken respectfully of his wife. After declaring again that the Commonwealth had utterly failed to establish a motive, Mr. Sinclair began to touch upon other features of the case. He referred to the happenings in the McCue house on the night of the murder, and declared that nothing there pointed to the prisoner as the murderer of his wife. The Commonwealth, the attorney understood, was laying great stress upon the varying statements of the accused in reference to the murder. Mr. Sinclair admitted that their statements did vary or rather that a series of witnesses have declared that the accounts were different, but in all of these statements the defense lawyer saw the one prominent distinguishing feature in that he (McCue) had been attacked, and that his wife had probably been killed. The variations were minor in their character, and might be accounted for by the fallibility of human understanding. No two people looked at the same thing with the same eyes; no two heard with the same ears. What one took to mean one thing, another took to mean something else. But suppose the prisoner, nervous and excited though he was, had given to each the same story, what would have been the effect? Would not the Commonwealth have declared at once that he had a stereotyped lie ready for everybody? Would not every action of McCue, whatever it was, be distorted and twisted entirely beyond recognition. "Gentlemen,"—said Mr. Sinclair, solemnly—"Gentlemen, there is something behind this case—some mystery that we do not understand." A rapid survey of the remaining points in the case was given by Mr. Sinclair. He referred to the effort of the Commonwealth to discredit the testimony of its own witness, Dr. Frank C. McCue, by declaring that contrary to what he had said, he had reached the residence several minutes before Grady and the police officers. The prosecution in substantiating this point had referred to the written testimony of Mr. Massie, who it was assured had said that he saw Dr. McCue enter the house, and five or ten minutes later saw Grady go in. Mr. Sinclair picked up the record and read from the testimony of Mr. Massie. The witness did say that he saw Mr. McCue enter the house, but here is what followed: "Five or ten minutes later, I saw a boy or lad run fast out of the lane." Grady is anything but a boy or a lad, and he wasn't running out the lane. The bloody shirt received its full mead of attention. A rather dramatic incident developed in this connection. "The Commonwealth has spoken of fairness," said Mr. Sinclair. "Let us have fairness then. I have nothing to say against Mr. Massie, but the Commonwealth has laid great stress upon these statements of Mrs. Massie, that when she first saw Mr. McCue on the night of the murder, he had the sleeves of his shirt rolled above his elbows. The Commonwealth, in other words, has tried to hint that it was a bloody butcher who stood there, or that the sleeves had been rolled up to conceal the blood and water on them, but what the Commonwealth has failed to do is to indicate to the jury the length of the sleeves of the shirt. Now look. Mr. Sinclair moved quickly forward and picked up the shirt. He held the sleeve against his own. It came an inch or two below the elbow. Allowing for the greatest muscularity of McCue and for the loss of length in stretching, the sleeve would probably have come to the elbow on the prisoner. With reference to the scrap of gauze found in the bath-room, Mr. Sinclair said it might or might not have been a piece of the shirt worn by the accused. The gentlemen who had searched the room on the night of the murder had failed to see it. The next day it had been found lying upon the floor. But what of it? Suppose it had been there, and suppose it was in reality a portion of the garment worn by McCue? It was in evidence that the prisoner had visited the bath-room on the night of the murder; that he had seen his dead wife lying upon the floor; that inexpressibly shocked, he had exclaimed, "Oh, my God, my darling wife!" and had then been led away by a lady. At this time, according to the witness Grady, his shirt was torn, and, in fact, a piece of it was hanging on by a mere shred. In conclusion Mr. Sinclair touched upon other points, including the socalled mysterious telephone message. Then he drifted into a lengthy discussion of the nature of circumstantial evidence. He related cases in which innocent men had been imprisoned and even hanged on such evidence. He quoted the instructions of the court. He referred to the argument of Captain Woods against the theory of a burglary. He admitted that it sounded unusual, but crime, he said, is never logical. It was certainly no less unreasonable to say that on Sunday night, when his neighbors were passing his door, J. Samuel McCue slew his own wife. The attorney also recalled the statement of Dr. Nelson, that a man knocked senseless from a blow with a soft weapon would probably produce nausea and nose-bleeding, and then laid stress upon the fact that when the accused was first seen on the stair he had one hand on his head and one to his breast. With reference to John Perry, he said that whatever the boy had said to others, one word of positive evidence from him as one actually present in the house at the time of the murder, was worth a ton of circumstances. Then Mr. Sinclair invited the jury to a contemplation of the positive statement of the negro boy. The last words of Mr. Sinclair were a warning to the jury of the responsibility resting upon them. He pictured the accused, surrounded by his children—his boy, his pretty innocent girl—and pleaded in their name that no mistake be made; that the jury move cautiously, carefully, deliberately. He declared that if McCue had killed his wife, the only thing that would have been left for him would have been a bullet for his own brain. The attorney called attention to the fact that there had been no effort to escape, and also to the fact that McCue had worn the bloody shirt in the presence of this entire crowd, and had then carelessly tossed it in a clothes basket; that he had made no effort to conceal it before the people came in. During the appeal tears streamed down the cheeks of the accused, who held in his arms his sleeping boy. It was nearly 11 o'clock when the session came to an end, and about two-thirds of the original crowd was still in the room. CAPT. RICHARD S. KER, Who Assisted Commonwealth's Attorney in the Prosecution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. CAPT. KER FOR PROSECUTION. Captain Richard S. Ker's searching and incisive questions when he took part in the cross-examination of witnesses, created a favorable impression of him as an astute lawyer. There was a general desire to hear him speak, and there was a large crowd present on Wednesday morning, when he arose to address the jury. He said, in part: "In endeavoring, gentlemen of the jury, to be of assistance to you in arriving at a true and just determination of the issue between the Commonwealth and this prisoner at the bar, I shall seek to consume as little of your time as possible, at the same time directing your attention to such points in the evidence in this case and the law applicable to it, as I feel may be of assistance to you in the discharge of your duty. "The full and able and convincing argument of my associate who has preceded me has lessened the burden of my duty very materially. Notwithstanding that, gentlemen, of the jury, I feel it my duty, as far as in me lies, to assist you, not by any charm of rhetoric, not by any spell of oratory, were it in my power to charm you thus, but by reason of the fact that you are endeavoring to direct your attention to evidence in this case, for by that evidence and that alone you are to determine what your verdict shall be. "You are selected, gentlemen, as the triers of this case, not because you are learned in the gift of law or gifted in any special metaphysical powers to discriminate between `hypotheses and reasonable doubts,' but because you are men of experience in the affairs of humankind; because you belong to the great body politic of this Commonwealth; because you, as citizens, are endowed with that same reason, that same common sense, that same human experience which leads you to judge the affairs and actions of your fellow-men. And in considering this case, gentlemen, it is not what I may say to you of our opinions or our beliefs. It is not what my learned friends on the other side may say as to their opinions and beliefs that you are to weigh determining this case, but what you have heard from the mouths of witnesses. By that, and that alone, you are to determine to guilt or the innocence of the prisoner at the bar. By that, and that alone, you are to say whether you have the abiding conviction or not of his guilt, and by that, and that alone, you are to put your finger upon and give a reason for any doubt that may exist in your minds. It is easy, by beautiful theories and castles in the air, for the eloquent tongues of counsel on the other side to suggest doubts to the jury. But the doubts you are to consider, the only doubts you are to consider, are not those suggested by counsel in argument, are not those things that might been, but those things that are detailed to you by the witnesses and not by the counsel. "The able counsel for the prisoner who already said to you, in considering this case you are expected to apply to it not any special metaphysical learning, but simply the common sense and every-day experience and reason, based upon that common sense and every-day experience, that will lead you gentlemen to determine in your minds whether this prisoner is guilty or whether he is innocent. It may be that after certain trials you, like myself, have heard jurors who sat in the cases say, `we all believe that man guilty, we are all satisfied about it, but we didn't think the evidence showed it.' "Gentlemen of the jury, if a juror after his examination by a court, goes into the jury box with a mind free and clear of all feeling as to whether the accused be guilty or innocent, and he hears only the evidence as detailed to him by witnesses and legitimate argument of counsel and the instructions of court, and then he feels and is satisfied that the accused is guilty, that is all the law requires." "The law does not ask and demand of you any infallibility. It doesn't require of you that you should be transported, because you happen to be trying a case, to some high plane away above your fellow-mortals and that you exercise the acumen not common to everyday man. Captain Ker declared that it is idle for any jury to say that it believes a prisoner guilty but that the evidence did not prove it. "I ask you if the evidence in this case does not satisfy you beyond any doubt that the prisoner here is responsible for the foul murder of Fannie McCue," said the lawyer. "Let us see what this evidence does show. It is true that the accused occupied a prominent place in this community, that his family was one of social prominence, and that it could not afford to drag the skeleton out of the closet and exhibit it on the streets and in public places. Pride and business considerations would have prevented this. I challenge your every-day common sense to say if it is not the `little straws,' in cases like this, which show the way the wind blows. It would not be proper to convict the accused upon the evidence of a single witness, but it is impossible that all of the witnesses could have been mistaken when they testified to the strained relations between the accused and his wife. Was not that boy right, when, looking upon his dead mother, he said, `this is the most peaceful look I have seen on her face for years.' The evidence shows that for years this man had been caring less and less for the tender, true and loving woman who was his wife, and that he had become less and less concerned about the marriage relations. Leading such a life a man becomes more and more indifferent. It is not a sudden wrenching apart of the ties which bind their hearts together. It is gradual, it takes some time for either the man or the woman to reach the point when he or she is ready to declare that his or her life is a `hell on earth.' This was the case in this unhappy home." "I take issue with the counsel on the other side when they say that there must be a motive for every crime before it can be punished. It is not necessary—it is not law and not common sense—to prove a motive before you can punish a man known to be guilty. "Let us see if the statement of the accused that his life was a `hell on earth' was meant to refer to his early struggles. It was during the last few years that his life had been filled with misery. Unless you think that John S. White, his friend and fellow-practicioner, was manufacturing evidence, you are bound to believe that the accused referred to his wife as `that woman' and then added that she was the most jealous creature he had ever known.' I do not pretend to say that at times the tender clinging love of the wife did not bring to the memory of the husband a recollection of his marriage vows and awake in his breast feelings of tenderness; I do not pretend to say that there was always wrangling and dissension. The love of the woman was bound to awake at times, but the returns are clearly proven to have been strained and unhappy. It is a little significant that the only people who passed Mrs. McCue as she went to church that fateful night noticed her sadness. "Let us see what happened at that house on the night of the tragedy. The accused says he was knocked senseless by a little scratch on the face, by some nameless instrument, introduced by the ingenuity of the counsel, which produced a concussion of the brain, but no contusion on the surface. What witness tells you that this could be done? Dr. C. S. Venable says it can't be done, Dr. H. T. Nelson says it is impossible, and Dr. J. E. Early says the same thing. Who says it was possible? Only the counsel for the defense. Take the statements of the accused. Counsel for the defense say that varying statements show the truth. This is correct as to different witnesses testifying about the same matter, but not as to one witness same matter, but not as to one witness speaking of the same transaction. That is the only thing he sticks to. He knows that he must not know what had happened if he is to escape the responsibility. "Seven different statements, only consistent as to the one point of unconsciousness have been made by the accussed. You are asked to believe that a time when people were all astir and when the neighbors were all up, a burglar went to the house and committed the crime, that he placed the baseball bat in the corner of the room, that he stood the gun in place, and that he did the deed when, by waiting a few minutes longer, the inmates would have been in bed and he could have burglarized at his will. "Was it burglary? What strange character of robber was this who considerately refused to allow his victims to go quietly to sleep and then burgle at his leisure, but rushed into a lighted room and attacked the woman and the man. Gentlemen, can you believe it? A few moments later the man and the woman would have been asleep and the night prowler would have had the house for his own. Yet, he did not wait. And then after he had knocked the man senseless and killed the woman—when the latter was dead and out of the way and he might have killed the former if he had wished—after he had done all of this, gentlemen, he quietly left the house disturbing nothing and the only effect of his visit was the death of this poor woman! Gentlemen, is it reasonable; do you believe it? "Was it a man seeking revenge? Would such a man if he sought the life of the woman attack her in the presence of her husband? Would he go to the house relying upon weapons he expected to find on the premises? If he sought the blood of the man himself would he rush at him unarmed, would he knock him senseless and then when, with a gun in his hands, he had his enemy at his mercy, leave him to live while he slew his unoffending wife? Is it reasonable, gentlemen, do you believe it? "Was he a burglar scared off before he could gather his booty or a murderer who had not time to complete his crime? If this had been true, the weapons would have been flung hastily aside. But were they? No! The bat that bruised the tender flesh of the woman was standing carefully placed near the mantel; the gun that had torn her breast, was even as carefully stood in a corner of the hall. It is reasonable, gentlemen, do you believe it? Next he referred to the considerate way in which his associate, Captain Woods, had handled Willie McCue in yesterday's argument, and then he added: "It is not in my heart to remove that veil. But I cannot help feeling that however great the battle William McCue was fighting, however much his father's people may have wondered at the step he was taking, I cannot help feeling that in God's own providence there was some way for that boy, fighting though he was, to have yet told you the truth and been justified in his own conscience, in the opinions of his fellow-men, and in the smiling approval of his God. It may be that the ties of family; it may be that there was his father's life in his hands, justified that boy in going upon that stand and swearing to you that the relations of his parents had been pleasant, when you know from the statements he repeatedly made to others that that was not the truth. I say these things may have justified him. I admit it is hard for us to tell, but I cannot help feeling that in the long run, in the final wind up, truth, wherever it falls, and whoever it hurts, is the best course for us. Willie McCue is the only witness of this immediate family who attempts to speak to you of the relations existing in that family. I say that whatever you may think of his misfortune, however disposed you are to draw the veil of charity over his conduct, however much disposed you may be to look with sorrow and pity upon that poor boy, and regret that he lost the battle instead of winning, still you cannot fail to believe that the statements he made to you upon the witness-stand was untrue, and that the statements he made repeatedly to others in regard to the relations between his father and mother were correct. "Were actions of the accused on the night of the murder consistent with his innocence?" asked the speaker. "No outcry for help; simply a cool call for a 'phone number? The negro who was afraid to tell the truth on the stand was also afraid to make an outcry. There they were, both of them, as dumb and mute as oysters. There was the brother, also, who goes down one of the principal streets without once giving the alarm. He must have been at the house from five to ten minutes before the news began to spread. In all that time these people give out no alarm, and the neighbors pace the street in front of their houses in ignorance of the crime. We cannot tell when the public ever would have heard of it had it not been for the young lady at the telephone office." In ending, Captain Ker said: "Gentlemen, the Commonwealth requires that where any man, be he prince or pauper, does an offense against her law, he shall receive the punishment of the law, and it makes no difference to the great body of people, to the ultimate good of the Commonwealth, whether you are now trying a man who is able, as my friend says the accused is, to pay out $2,500 or $3,000 in life insurance, or whether you are passing upon the case of the veriest pauper or beggar. The law requires that the same even-minded justice be meted out to one as to the other. "My friend who has preceded me has held up to you your awful responsibility. It seemed to me—I don't want to do him an injustice— that he was attempting to scare you, gentlemen, with ghosts. I don't think it is necessary for me to tell you twelve men, who have been tested and found competent to sit on this case, of your responsibility. I am certain from the earnest, honest, careful, painstaking attention paid by you to every detail of this case that you realize your responsibility. I am also certain that as true men of Virginia you cannot be frightened by the nursery scare that `the goblins will git you if you don't look out.' The holding up of the fact that this man's ghost may haunt you in after life is not enough to deter Virginians from doing their duty in any emergency when they are called upon to perform it. J. TINSLEY COLEMAN, Of Counsel for Defense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. MR. COLEMAN FOR THE DEFENSE. Mr. J. Tinsley Coleman of Lynchburg, who came into the case after the beginning of the trial and after the retirement of Mr. Harmon, made a very able and forcible presentation of the facts bearing upon the innocence of the prisoner. His speech was a severe arraignment of the witnesses for the prosecution and a careful dissection of the evidence they gave. "If your honor please, and gentlemen of the jury," said he in commencing, "there is no occasion that you should be warned against eloquence and rhetoric from me. If I have any talent whatsoever, I trust and believe in reasoning with you without the aid of either of these mediums. I shall attempt now in a plain, unvarnished way to reason with you in respect to this evidence and in respect to the law—to see if I can assist you in coming to what I conceive to be a just and proper conclusion. Of course, gentlemen of the jury, you cannot argue with me in the sense of asking questions, but I invite you, as I proceed, to debate within your minds to see if my conclusions are not supported by law and the evidence in the case. "The first thing I want to call your attention to is this—there is an unusual feature in this case. You know enough of judicial trials to understand that ordinarily the jurors who sit in the boxes are from the community and the vicinage wherein arises the case they are investigating. In this case that is not true. Every man of you was brought here from somewhere else—some from Richmond, some from Petersburg, some from Fredericksburg, and some from Warrenton. Now, gentlemen, what does that mean? It means that the community in which this occurrence took place is satisfied that it cannot fairly try the case, and the community speaking through the judge of this court, has asked your assistance in reaching the justice of this case upon its own confession that it is disqualified from doing so. "The community frankly comes forward and says to you gentlemen, `We are disqualified to try this case, and we ask you to come here in order that there may be no miscarriage of justice.' "It was that fear of a miscarriage of justice that brings you here in order that you, who are not prejudiced, may judge honestly, uprightly and fairly. But, notwithstanding this confession upon the part of the community, the community has, nevertheless, appeared in this trial by proxy in the person of my good friend, Captain Woods. All right; we have no objection. I have nothing to say about it, but the thing which makes me wonder is how my friend who, he himself says, is the mouthpiece of the public at this trial—how he can conceive the idea that he is in a judicial frame of mind and can compare himself to a juror—is beyond my mind." Then the speaker added with an exclamatory touch of sarcasm: "Swept into the forefront of this trial of a man who, he tells you, is his friend, and between whom and himself the relations were always friendly and cordial. It passes my understanding. How can he think that he is possessed of any judicial frame of mind and can deal with the case as you are expected to deal with it? The issue propounded to you by the lawyers on the other side is life or death. If that be true, it behooves you to cast aside all other considerations. It is your duty to hear every detail of the defense and to give the accused a fair trial— not simply an honest trial—I know he will get that—but a trial in which the scales of justice shall be so evenly held that the dust of injustice shall have been blown away." The speaker here paid a very pretty tribute to the legal profession and asked the jury not to steel their hearts against him because he was a lawyer, but to follow his arguments and see if they were not reasonable. "The Commonwealth has failed to establish a motive, but even if it had established a motive," said Mr. Coleman, "I am prepared to show you that it was insufficient. You must try this case upon the law and the evidence and you are bound by the law which you have sworn to regard. "The statements of Crawford could not have been true, because, he himself has denied it, as proven by two or three witnesses. You can't doubt that he said that Mr. and Mrs. McCue, after fourteen years of married life, were still on their honeymoon. It is not worth while for me to comment on the letters that have been introduced into court. You know they could not have passed between people who were unfriendly." At this point accused weeps, as he does whenever reference is made to these letters. "Let us see," continued Mr. Coleman, "if there is evidence to show that these relations ever changed." Here the attorney reviewed the evidence of Miss Bertie Crawford, and said that it was a fair inference that McCue told his wife that his trip was no affair of hers, because he did not want Miss Bertie Crawford to know about the trip. Mr. Coleman referred to Mr. Brand as "a man without a memory," who could not tell a word to what the accused had said to his wife, although McCue was "ready to kill her in a second." The speaker was caustic in his reference to the evidence of the colored janitor, upon whom the Commonwealth relied as an exemplar of how a husband should treat his wife. The lawyer facetiously alluded to the negro as the "Arbiter Elegantiarum of Charlottesville." In referring to Minor, the colored butler, Mr. Coleman said: "He is a negro, it is true, but the other side was the first to introduce Africa into this war." This witness, though he be as black as the ace of spades, was the best witness to testify to the relations of these two people. He could not have lived in this house nine years without knowing if there were unpleasant relations and without speaking of these relations. "Grady's evidence was to show that the accused took his wife to the theatre, to church and to public places. "The fact cannot be whistled down by the wind that the accused taxed himself to carry insurance policies to the amount of $60,000 for the benefit of his wife. (Here the prisoner again weeps.) Suppose he was guilty of a forgetfulness of the marital vows. May not your virtue and mine be but the insufficiency of temptation. That does not afford a proper motive. Men do not murder their wives simply because they do not love them." After quoting from the instructions and making further reference to the motive as defined in the law of the court, Mr. Coleman went on to discuss the occurrences in the house on the night of the murder. Like Mr. Sinclair, he declared that the charge of murder against the husband, was no less improbable than the theory of attempted burglary. "We claim, gentlemen," he said, "that if the theory of burglary is improbable, the theory that this man McCue selected that hour and that time to shoot his own wife in his own house, in a populous part of the town, where the streets were lighted and the house itself was lighted, when people were passing along the sidewalk; we claim that this is more wildly improbable than the theory of burglary or any other theory that the ingenuity of the human mind can devise. "Now let us see about this theory of burglary, cried down by the other side. The house was open. This is admitted. McCue had been out of town and he came back unexpectedly. The family went to church. It was Sunday night. The house was left entirely alone. Suppose a man had set out that night to commit a robbery. No house in Charlottesville would have been more inviting. It was the house of a well-to-do man. There would be no difficulty of getting into it. We all know that. The owner of the house was supposed to be away. The wife and children had gone out. What was easier? "Suppose a man had gone into that house, and while he was there, McCue and his wife came in through the front door. In a residence of that size, he could easily have concealed himself. It is in evidence that the plug was in the bath tub and the hot water was running. The couple went to the bed chamber and began to disrobe. Mrs. McCue had been away. What was more natural than that she would wish to take a bath, that she turned on the hot water. Now suppose a man in that house had seen her in the bath tub or in the room. What infernal and unmentionable scheme might not have entered his head? "Gentlemen, this is no idle vagary; in my city a short while ago, a white woman was assaulted, not at night, in some obscure section, but in the broad open light of day, and in one of the most populous sections of the town." The speaker went on to elaborate upon the probability or the improbability of the theory of burglary. He supposed the burglar sneaking through the house, coming suddenly upon the man and wife in the lighted bed chamber; observing the start of the husband as the strange face peering through the door showed in the looking-glass. Thinking himself recognized, he had done that which would have come naturally to any marauder, who, caught in another's bed chamber, would have met a just fate, had he been shot down—he had attacked the man and "put him out of commission." Then with his work unfinished, he turned upon the woman, who had seen him, and forever closed her lips. "Whether this is true or not, gentlemen," declared Mr. Coleman, "I do not know. It is the statement that has been consistently made by this accused. I repeat that I do not know whether this supposition is true to the facts or not, but neither, gentlemen, do you; I have seen no evidence to discredit it; neither have you. If it sounds improbable, it is certainly not less improbable to think that McCue killed his own wife. Do you think it is more probable that McCue killed his own wife, than that a burglar killed her? If you do, why? According to the testimony of Mr. Dinwiddie, they were on the best of terms that night. There was no reason for it. It is impossible to conceive it. We have heard much of the varying statements of the accused. It is impossible that some of these variations sprang up in the minds of those who testified here? But suppose it had been said here that he told throughout a straight story, would it not at once have been declared a stereotyped untruth?" "We have also heard that there was no outcry, and the inference has been made that this man McCue killed his wife and then tried to conceal his crime. And yet, what have we in the evidence? Miss Bragg, telephone operator, says here that McCue broke in suddenly and asked her for `somebody.' When she asked him whom he wanted he gave the first name that flashed into his head, `Mr. Williams.' "She told him the 'phone of Mr. Williams was busy. Now, mark you, gentlemen, what he said: `Oh, central, do not tell me it is busy; somebody is in my house, has shot me and probably killed my wife!' Gentlemen, of the jury, was that the way to conceal a crime? It has been said that the police learned by accident and arrived in time to `let the cat out of the bag.' But did this accused not himself tell the girl, who in turn notified the police? It is true he did not rush into the streets and cry for help. He had another way. He used the telephone. "A great deal has been said here," continued Mr. Coleman, in effect, "about the bloody shirt. Gentlemen, it is in evidence that the wound of Mrs. McCue was almost bloodless until she was turned over and the cavity was opened. It has been also said by my friend Ker that she could not, from the nature of the would, have been shot while she was in the bath tub. Then, where was she shot? "They do not know, but this we do know. There was no blood in the chamber and none in the hall. While Mrs. McCue lay upon her back no blood came from the wound. If she had been picked up and carried to the bath tub after she was shot, the clothes of the man who carried her would have been saturated with blood. Upon this shirt you see only a few spots. Where did they come from? They came, gentlemen of the jury, from the bloody fingers of the undertaker, Biery, who admitted that the shirt was handed to him." Emphasis was also laid by Mr. Coleman upon the fact that there had been no effort to conceal the shirt. He referred to the scrape of gauze and declared that nobody could say positively that it was part of the shirt; that it could not have been in the bath room on the night of the murder since none of the searchers had found it; that nobody knew how it got there the next day or would ever know. He then proceeded to attack the Commonwealth for bringing into its arguments references to testimony that the court had expressly declared should be used only for the purpose of impeaching witnesses, and should not be considered as evidence against the accused. He said he had endeavored to point out what the Commonwealth had undertaken to prove and what it had ignominiously failed to prove. He would now touch lightly upon a few other matters and would then attempt to apply the law, to which, as he said before, the Commonwealth had paid but slight attention. He referred with amazement to the statement of Captain Woods that unless he was senseless McCue must be held responsible for the murder of his wife, because he was in the house on the night of the tragedy. This, the speaker declared, was not the law. Before he proceeded farther in this connection, Mr. Coleman referred to a matter he had overlooked in the afternoon. This was the conversation in the jail between John S. White and the a cused. After calling attention to the fallibility of human nature and the inability of the most careful always to report accurately, he analyzed the conversation itself. As for the "hell on earth," he declared that the conviction was in the mind of the witness that there was nothing to indicate and no reason to believe that McCue referred to the domestic affairs of his own home. The speaker also combatted the supposition that any odium was attached to the epithet, "that woman," with which McCue is said to have referred to his wife. During the next three-quarters of an hour Mr. Coleman discussed and elucidated the instructions of the court. He took them up one by one and went over each carefully and thoroughly, dwelling upon those dealing with circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt. When he had gotten through he went back to the evidence and declared that the arguments of the prosecution applied with equal force in favor of the accused. He thought that a man like McCue, of high social standing and no inconsiderable business position, should, in his own house, surrounded by his neighbors, murder his own wife, was inconceivable. In conclusion, Mr. Coleman made a brief but earnest appeal for his client, declaring that the jury would not seek its decision in the headlong passions of an infuriated crowd, but would determine the case according to the law and the evidence. JOHN L. LEE. Leading Counsel for Defense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. MR. LEE FOR DEFENSE. What was thought to be the last day of the argument had arrived. Mr. John L. Lee, the noted criminal lawyer of Lynchburg, was to close for the defense, and he was to be followed by Mr. Frank Gilmer, the popular Commonwealth's Attorney for the city of Charlottesville. The storming of the court-house began early. The greatest crowd yet assembled gathered on the green and rushed for the doors as soon as they were opened. Within five minutes every seat in the building was taken, and every available inch of additional space was in the hands of two hundred men and women well content to stand for hours, if they were only permitted to see and hear. Still they came. By the time the court bell rang not another man could squeeze in, and the stream still pouring in had to be turned back. The court-room was a perfect babel of chattering voices. Three times as many women as usual were present. A perfect cloud of negroes darkened the right gallery. On the outskirts of the black crowd was a line of white faces, who, regardless of the proximity of the negroes, had pressed in on the rear. Within the bar twice as many people as it could hold had packed themselves. Officers of the court, and some of the attorneys, could find no seats. The court finally had to take a hand. "The administration of justice," declared Judge Morris, "is more important than the curiosity of people." He ordered the crowd back, but suffered some relaxation of his rules for the benefit of the throng. In return he demanded the most perfect order from the people, and warned them against demonstration of any sort. This statement he repeated later. McCue came in about 10 o'clock, accompanied by the officers. As he forced his way through the bar he bent and kissed his sister and his children. Then he sat down, lifted his little girl to his knee and placed one arm across the shoulders of his youngest son. The preliminary proceedings of the court were dispatched with great celerity, and then the crowd sat back in expectation. The court rapped vigorously for order, and then called upon Mr. Lee. The great Lynchburg lawyer, the leader of the defense side, arose from his seat, where he had been pouring over a bundle of papers. Every eye was fixed upon him. He stood straight and tall as he faced the jury. His powerful, resonant voice penetrated to every corner of the court-room. "If your Honor please, and gentlemen of the jury," said he, "the longer I live and the more nearly I approach the last stage of human existence, the more I feel myself impelled to believe in a destiny over which we poor mortals have but little, if any, control. It sometimes seems to me that the moving finger of destiny writes, and having writ, moves on, and that all our power cannot lure it back. As we move through the serious ways of life, how uncertain, gentlemen, are our footsteps. As we come to the cross-roads, without sign-board to indicate whither they lead, what is it but fatality or destiny that makes us choose the one or the other way. Between vice and misfortune there is a difference, but it is an underlying difference in many cases. It does not always appear upon the surface, to be read of all men. The results of the two are frequently identical, and it is extremely difficult to determine in many cases which has led to a given result. Now, gentlemen, when I say that to you, men of maturity and judgment, I feel confident that you cannot fail to apprehend my meaning. "How many men on this jury, in the days that you have put behind you forever, and which you can never recall, have found yourselves placed in the most embarrassing and awkward positions—positions repulsive to every fibre of your mind and your being—and yet you couldn't help it. You had done no wrong, your conscience spoke to you in no disapproving voice, but you felt that in the eyes of society you had been condemned. Isn't that true, gentlemen? Isn't it true? "And haven't you found this to follow upon the heels of that condition: The very instant that evil is spoken of you, the very instant that some malignant tongue sends forth a rumor, whether true or untrue, of your misconduct, haven't you found more people ready to believe it than disbelieve it? "Honor bright, hasn't that been the experience of every man on this jury? And so far as you have been able to determine, has it not been the experience of every man whom you have had opportunities of observing in that respect? The greatest of all writers of the English language has epitomized that truth. He has told you that `the evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.' Why the Almighty, in His infinite wisdom, created us, as we are told, in His own image; why He should have so constructed the human heart and human mind that it is ever ready to believe evil, only God himself in His wisdom knows. "You may live a long life, dotted here and there and all along the line with noble deeds, but unless that life has been lived in the full glare of the public like that of a statesman, or a mighty general, or a great orator, you die and only your immediate circle of friends know of the beauty of your life. But as you struggle and totter along that road that leads from the cradle to the grave, if you slip but once, if you once stain your good name, generations to come after you will remember it and speak of it. "And strange to say—sad to say—when the voice of calumny has touched you, when the scandalous tongue has blackened your fair name, it is not only your enemies who profess to believe it, but frequently it is the friend whom you have nurtured in prosperity, gentlemen, in the day of our prosperity. "But happy is the man who, in the hour of adversity, in the hour of public condemnation, undeserved, let it be, who can reach outside of his own family and put his hand on one man who believes in him and who loves him and who stands by him. And it is that position, gentlemen, it is that condition, that makes the position of my client here pitiable in my eyes. And if you are honest men—as I believe you are, as I know you want to be—it will make it pitiable in your eyes and will appeal to your sense of honor and your sense of right. "Gentlemen of the jury, this is no ordinary case. It is an indictment to which I am now addressing myself—a man charged with wife murder—but it is extraordinary in this, that from the very time when that charge was made public the men who should have been the prisoner's friends, and some of whom have told you they were his friends for twenty long years, unwilling to await the developments of a fair trial, to harbor in their hearts one instant that charity which is commended to us by God above, deserted him. "Put your hand on your hearts, gentlemen, and tell me, you who read the newspapers, is there likeness of any sort between publications of the public press and the evidence you have heard in this case. "Gentlemen of the jury, yours is a hard task—harder than that which has been imposed upon me and my colleagues. Ordinarily a man comes into court presumed to be innocent, but this man, before trial, before the testimony was heard in his case, was led into this court before you already condemned, and you knew it. Many of you on that jury, in your integrity and candor, were fair enough when you took the oath to say that you had read newspaper articles; that you had read accounts of this transaction, and that to a great extent your minds had been interested, and you had formed opinions based upon these accounts. And yet you stated, and I have no doubt truthfully, that you could put these reports out of your mind and give this accused a fair and impartial trial. But, gentlemen of the jury, guard yourselves. If ever there was a time in the lives of you men when you needed God Almighty's guidance and divine protection, it is to-day. I know that you know that the people of this State, never having heard the testimony which you have heard, and deciding upon scandalous publicity, from one end of the land to the other, and expecting a conviction at your hands. I am not here to deal in milk and cider talk. You know as well as I know, that if you acquit this man you will receive at the hands of those who haven't heard the evidence the fiercest criticism, and I have no doubt you very properly fear and dread it. But think of your responsibility, gentlemen. A man's life, his reputation, his character, the lives of his little children, are being weighed in the balance here. You know what it means. "Ordinarily," continued Mr. Lee, "a man comes into court presumed to be innocent. But this man, before he was heard, was brought into this court already condemned. Some of the jurymen themselves, in their integrity and honesty, had admitted that they had read newspapers and formed opinions before they had ever come into court. These opinions they hoped to lay aside. "The attorney for the defense had no doubt that the gentlemen spoke honestly when they said they would put these opinions aside, but he warned them that they must be careful; that if ever they needed the guidance of a divine providence, it was to-day, in this case. He declared in all candor that for himself, were he on trial for his life, he would prefer a verdict at the hands of twelve men who had absolutely no previously-formed opinion of the case." Proceeding along this line, Mr. Lee referred to the contagion of public rage against the accused. He would mince no words, he said. He pictured a public fired by false newspaper reports; a public ready almost to rise up and strike down the man who claims for McCue anything but a hangman's rope. The gentlemen of the jury were aware of the sentiment throughout the State. "A man's brain is after all nothing but a piece of machinery, built along certain principles and designed to move along given lines. It is like a phonograph. Breathe into it a note—it may be a false note— but years after it sounds itself again and becomes a living thing once more. And so the accounts given by the newspapers can never be effaced from your memory. They are in your good skulls at this minute—mixed up with what you have heard on this witness stand. You have got to convert your minds into a fan and winnow out the chaff of newspaper notices from the truth as learned. "In this day of enlightened civilization, we have adopted the motto, `It is better that ninety and nine guilty men escape than one innocent man be punished.' "Let's be honest with each other. Suppose you, Mr. Traylor, were in my place and your son was in the place of the accused. Would you not feel that he might, under the circumstances, get a fair trial, but you would doubt it. "This is a remarkable case. It is not only important to my client, but it is likely to form an epoch in the legal history of this State. Acquit this man, and the time will come when you will be regarded as having laid down another golden rule—that men shall be tried by the evidence and not by the scandals circulated. "Let us see what are some of the results of this supposed evidence. We examined one hundred and forty men. Nearly all were disqualified because they had read all the idle rumors that any scandal mongers may have seen fit to set afloat in the public prints. If it does nothing more, your verdict of acquittal will put your seal of disapproval on prejudging the case before the evidence is heard. "The Commonwealth is ably represented. The Commonwealth's Attorney occupies the best position of any lawyer in the case. He will tell you he is not biased—he believes it is true—but he is mistaken. I am biased, and I know it. I am outraged by the wrongs that have been done my client. "Mr. Ker occupies the same position in this case that I do—he is a paid attorney, and strictly within his rights. My good friend Captain Woods, I am sorry to say, occupies no enviable position. "I protest against the use of this friendship for the accused to creep into your hearts and to prejudice them against him—the very mouthpiece of the sentiment which disqualified this community from trying this case. He pictured his opponent as a Bacon, appearing against his friend Essex; a man who under the guise of friendship for the accused, crept in and attempted to poison the minds of the jury; a man who mistook vituperation for argument and abuse for reason; a man who constantly sought but should not receive the commendation of his fellow-men. "Some day," said Lee, "the same public that, for months unenlightened as to the facts in this case, have been clamoring for conviction, may, like the fickle winds of heaven, veer around. My friend will then find that over rough swamps and meadows he has been chasing the everlasting will-o'-the-wisp—public sentiment and public approval. At times you may think you have got it and can keep it, but, gentlemen of the jury, it has got to come to you; you cannot run it down. Having, as he said, prepared the jury for the argument of the case itself, Mr. Lee proceeded to take up the law, as set forth in the instructions, and the evidence, as included in the testimony of the witnesses. He referred to circumstantial evidence as a chain which was as strong as its weakest link, and which is utterly destroyed when a single link is shattered. The defense he claimed to have broken, not the weakest link, but the strongest. There was one link so fragile that it broke of its own weight. This link the attorney declared to be the puerile effort of the Commonwealth to establish bad relations between the man and wife. The gentlemen of the prosecution had introduced evidence that was ridiculous; that could not even be called decent "straws." And yet these gentlemen thought that this evidence was terrific and convincing. "It simply shows, gentlemen of the jury," declared the speaker, "how the spiders of venom have woven cobwebs about their usually strong and clear intellects." The testimony of the various Commonwealth witnesses bearing upon the alleged bad relations existing between the accused and his wife was taken up by Mr. Lee and dissected. He gathered the bits on his fingers and blew them away; declared that they were the veriest chaff. Like those of his associates who had preceded him, he called the attention of the jury to the oaths by which they had sworn to try the accused, according, not only to the evidence, but also the law. The law he declared to be embodied in the instructions. Under the heat of argument, the gentlemen of the prosecution had done a thing absolutely contrary to this law. They had dragged in the evidence used to impeach Willie McCue and John Perry—evidence that the court had distinctly stated should not be used against the accused. The alleged statements of the two witnesses had been detailed to the jury. How many of these statements had in reality been made, Mr. Lee declared that God in heaven only knew. But whether they were true or not, they had nothing to do with the case. "For God's sake, gentlemen, when you retire to your room, give us a square deal. The only possible effect of this evidence would be to put Willie McCue and John Perry out of the case entirely. "It can be used for no other purpose. And, gentlemen, when these two witnesses are put out of the case, does not the Commonwealth find itself with nothing left? His Honor has told you that you must not consider this testimony as affecting the decision for or against this accused. Can you do it? Have you the sense and the brains to keep them separate? It will not be easy, gentlemen. Could I do it myself? Thank God I am not called upon to do it. It is you, gentlemen, upon whom the responsibility lies. Be careful, gentlemen, for God's sake, be careful." Somewhere in the beginning Mr. Lee had asserted that the defense could shatter the strongest link in the chain of circumstantial evidence, on which the Commonwealth hung its case. The speaker now went back to this point and resumed the argument from this direction. The "lifelong friend of the accused," the leader of the prosecution, pausing significantly in his speech, had declared that if nothing else had been established by the Commonwealth, one thing alone would be sufficient to convict the prisoner—the varying accounts he gave of what had occurred in the house on the night of the murder. What followed developed into one of the most dramatic incidents of the entire trial. Mr. Lee referred to the likelihood that there was as much variation in the impression gathered by the witnesses as there was in what the prisoner said. He discussed the alleged variations, and declared that they were so slight as to amount to nothing. But what he said here was preliminary to what the speaker was holding in reserve. He suddenly reached for a Bible and held it in his hand. He leaned forward and looked into the faces of the jurymen. "Gentlemen," he asked in effect, "What was the most important event in all the history of the world? Was it not the scene enacted upon Calvary, when Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, gave up His life for humanity. I speak reverently, gentlemen; I trust that you will receive what I say with reverence for this Holy Book upon which you have already taken your oath. The life or the liberty of a man is at stake, and only in this crisis do I venture to use the inspired words themselves to save him." Not a sound disturbed the silence in the court-room while Mr. Lee began to turn from place to place in the Bible he held. Speculation was rife as to what he would do. Finally he began to speak again, and then it became clear to the audience what was coming. The attorney for the defense was about to show that the inspired servants of the Christ himself had given varying accounts, not of an ordinary occurrence, not upon which nothing depended, but of the greatest, the grandest, the most significant event the world was ever to see—the crucifixion of their Lord and Master. Upon these writers lay the responsibility of transmitting to posterity the record of this glorious scene. They were there in the shadow of the cross; they saw and then they wrote. Each saw what the other did; each read the inscription on the cross written in three languages; before the eyes of each passed the incidents of that marvelous day. And yet, what had they written? No two of them agreed. The differences were radical. Not even the inscription above the head of the Saviour had been read alike by these inspired men. It was a bold stroke, and it was powerful in its effect. Mr. Lee read the sacred words aloud to the jury. As he went along he pointed out the variance in the accounts given. "And now, gentlemen of the jury," was all the comment the attorney made when he was through, "are you prepared to say that the main fact of the crucifixion did not occur because four different accounts of it, written by the saints themselves, differ—and differ radically? Again, gentlemen, I speak with deep reverence; but, gentlemen, I ask you, Are you prepared to say this thing?" A moment later Mr. Lee had left this point, and was delving again into the evidence itself. He referred now to the occurrences in the house on the night of the murder. "I promised you to be truthful to you, and I say to you that McCue's account of what happened at the house don't seem reasonable. Does what the prosecution say happened there sound any more reasonable? If the accused had said he had been knocked senseless, and had stopped there, it would have been all right. "I have no doubt upon the point that he could have been knocked senseless without leaving any mark of violence. Dr. Early said so at the coroner's inquest, before there was clamor against the accused; but at the trial, without having had any experience and without having read any further upon the subject, he believes that any lick which could have knocked the accused senseless, would have left some marks of such violence. Are you not bound to believe that he is influenced by public sentiment? "Of the millions of men that `God has poured from his bowl,' as Oma Kayam expresses it, no two of them are alike. And to the extent that they are unlike physically, to that extent they are unlike mentally, and so I cannot say that Mr. McCue's conduct on that night was unreasonable. It would have been unreasonable in me, but in a man of McCue's mental calibre, it may have been perfectly reasonable. He acted possibly as best he could. For you, gentlemen, to sit quietly in the jury box and to decide what is reasonable is like the gentle doe deciding what would be reasonable in the fierce tiger. "God knows, gentlemen, what I should have done myself, had I found my house full of gunpowder and my dear wife missing. I am told that one of you gentlemen is an engineer. He knows, and you all know, that in moments of frightful mental excitement a man does not act rationally. He does not stop to reason, gentlemen. He does not stop to consider whether or not he is doing what another would do under the circumstances. He acts at once, and acts impulsively. "It will not do, with life the issue, for you in your calm deliberation to decide that the man's action was reasonable. I might have acted differently—you probably would have acted differently. "We are not always the same men. We do to-day what we would not design to do to-morrow. A philosopher has said that what we do a given day is frequently dependent upon what we had for breakfast." Mr. Lee went on to discuss the question of probability and improbability along the line already covered by his associates. He referred to the argument of the prosecution concerning the lack of hue and cry. He declared that the accused had acted naturally in going at once to his telephone and calling for help. The office was connected with a hundred homes; had McCue gotten into his yard and squalled until his lungs gave way, he could not have published more broadly to the world the fact that a man had entered his home and stricken down his wife. The speaker thanked God that the innocent telephone girls had not allowed themselves to be swept away on the wave of public sentiment that had submerged the counsel for the prosecution. The Commonwealth had claimed that by utter lack of hue and outcry they had tried by insinuation to say that the police had learned of the murder by accident, and that they arrived unexpectedly upon the scene which the accused was trying to cover up the tracks of his crime. And yet what were the facts. The man had gone to his telephone and had done the most natural thing he could have done— called in his brother, who was a physician. But he had done more; he had broken in on the central office and had cried desperately, "Give me somebody; a burglar is in my house; he has knocked me senseless and probably killed my wife." Did he whisper this over the 'phone to some accessory? No; he cried aloud. He told the girl who could at once alarm the entire town, and it was this girl who had been told by McCue himself, who informed the police. Yet it had been argued that the police learned by accident that this man was seeking to cover up his guilt. "I don't know what your verdict may be—I can't tell how the evidence may have impressed you—but I have the right to beg that you will not place this man beyond the opportunity to clear himself—by consigning him to the gallows. I cannot see how, upon the evidence, you can fail to acquit; but even if you believe that the contention of the Commonwealth is true, you are bound to say that the deed was not due to deliberation. In urging the jury to be careful in its judgment and not to convict the accused, Mr. Lee said: "These newspaper reports that you have heard on the outside, the pressure brought to bear on your mind by the ripples of approbation or condemnation you have heard from the galleries, may have moulded your minds and your intelligence, but if you act as free, intelligent human beings, you cannot and will not do this thing." A little later, he added: "They haven't brought a living, respectable resident of Charlottesville, the people among whom the accused has lived, to speak of any unkind relations between McCue and his wife." Then, straightening himself up like a Roman gladiator, and with eyes ablaze and cheeks aflame, the speaker dramatically hurled a great bundle of letters on the desk before Captain Woods. Almost before the latter could make a retort, Judge Morris said: "Counsel on both sides finally assured me, before these arguments began, that they agreed to offer no more evidence. Gentlemen, the incident is closed." And so it was, for Mr. Lee submitted with the utmost grace. A moment later he resumed his speech. At this juncture, the speaker said: "And now, if your Honor please, I make it a rule never to do anything that the court has forbidden me to do, but while Captain Woods was addressing himself to the jury he referred to the business of these letters (producing correspondence between McCue and his wife, and during the progress of this very trial, he arose in the presence of this court and said that it was proper, even after the evidence had been closed and the arguments concluded, to offer additional evidence. I take him at his word. I tender you these additional letters, and I challenge you (turning to Captain Woods) to show them to that jury. "And now, gentlemen of the jury, let me say this to you: I have always made it a rule in cases of this character to make absolutely no appeal to the emotions of the gentlemen who do me the honor of listening. I am not here to deal with your emotions, but with your reason and your intellect, and in closing this case I do want to say this: You have been in this town and at this court-house long enough to realize that you are under pressure. The pressure of the population of this town, strange to say, is being brought to bear upon you. "You can feel it in the very atmosphere. You know full well that there exists that which we call public sentiment. Why, it is the most subtle thing on earth—as subtle as electricity. You cannot see it in the atmosphere, but it is there. You cannot touch it and you cannot hear it, but it is in the atmosphere. You breathe it just as electricity. "You are going to be controlled by that to some extent, I know. All of us are. If I were on that jury, I believe I would be controlled by it to some extent; but I am afraid it may have some effect upon you. All I want to do is this—to offer you against that public sentiment the sweet face of that little girl." Here Mr. Lee turned and pointed to tearful little Ruby McCue. "There is," added the speaker, "nothing on earth that can get all the good out of the heart of a man like the hand of a little girl. I offer it as an offset to this public sentiment. "And now, gentlemen of the jury, all we want you to do is to give us a fair and honest trial, to treat us justly, and to treat us fairly. Let love and kindness be coupled with right and justice, and so shall you become channels of the divine seal of God's eternal love." The speaker now resumed his seat amidst profound silence. FRANK GILMER, Commonwealth's Attorney for the City of Charlottesville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. MR. GILMER CLOSES FOR PROSECUTION. When court reconvened on the afternoon of November 4th to hear the closing speech for the prosecution by Mr. Gilmer, the same large crowd which had heard Mr. Lee was present. After Judge Morris had delivered his usual warning against demonstrations, there occurred an incident which for a minute caused a great flutter of excitement. Captain Woods arose, and with great dignity said: "I would like to make one statement, in view of the attack on me, which may have been so intended, and which sounded like an unjust attack. I desire to say that I refused a large fee in this case to prosecute —." At this point Messrs. Lee and Coleman both sprang to their feet, and quick as lightning said: "We object, and we ask that this jury be now discharged. We ask that an exception be noted to Captain Woods' statement, and that now in view of it the jury be forthwith discharged." Here Judge Morris promptly interposed, and turning to Captain Woods said: "I don't think explanations are right in this case." And here Messrs. Coleman and Lee were upon their feet again and saying: "We make a motion that in view of the statement of Captain Woods in the presence of this jury, that the jury and this prisoner be discharged." Captain Woods, who by now had recovered his composure, here said, "And let it be entered that Mr. Woods does not desire to make any further statement." The stenographer had all the trouble he wanted in noting the colloquy, the motion and the exceptions. Before the incident finally closed Judge Morriss said to Messrs. Lee and Coleman, "I don't find any trouble in overruling your motion for the discharge of the jury." There can be no denying the fact that Mr. Lee's references earlier in the day to Captain Woods were caustic, and that the latter must have felt an irresistible impulse to make a stinging retort. Just what he intended saying, nobody quite knows. Captain Woods was halted almost before his auditors caught the drift of his remarks. At the conclusion of this exciting incident, Commonwealth's Attorney Gilmer arose and addressed the jury. He said: "The same God that invested you with the power to decide this case has made it my duty to say to you how the law and the evidence should be considered. I say that the man who advises a wrong is worse than he who commits it. You have been here nearly three weeks giving to this case a most patient and careful consideration. The State is to be congratulated upon having such a jury. "I have known this man (the accused) for the past twenty years, and I say to you that this is the most unpleasant duty of my life. "I have never stood at this bar and asked the conviction of any man I thought to be innocent, and I would scorn to withhold from any jury any evidence that might be helpful to the accused. "Practicing law is a plain business proposition, and there is no occasion for any differences between attorneys. Before Captain Woods or Captain Ker came into this case, they observed the amenities of the profession. When Mr. Lee jumped into my associates in this case, it was evident that he had a very weak case. The accused can rest content that all that could be done in his behalf has been done. "The life of the accused is dear to me as any life in this State, but dearer than any one life is the peace and dignity of this Commonwealth. "You must construe this evidence according to law. It is hard to prove family dissensions. There is not that man living, no matter how poor and humble, or how rich and influential, who does not have sufficient pride to cancel, as far as possible, all evidences of family disagreement. Each parent hopes that his children will do better than he has done, and is too proud to cast obstacles in the way of their promotion. "If you see a family which is so secretive when a member is dead, what must have been their policy as to family disagreements? There cannot be happiness in a home when a man comes back and finds his wife ill, and who never inquires about her. Tell me that love dwells there. I'd rather see my children grow up in rags than to see them grow up in a household where the mother is allowed to suffer illness without recognition from the husband. "Deliver me from a dress parade love—from a love that shows itself only at the theatre and in public places. I want no stronger evidence of lack of love in the household than the fact that Sam McCue returned to find his wife ill and did not greet her, but treated her with scorn, when she asked where he had been. "You can't put jealousy and love in the same heart. There must be confidence and respect. The defense can't do what God himself has not been able to accomplish. When a husband promises to protect the woman who takes his name, he is responsible for her life when it is taken in his presence. There is a wide difference between vice and misfortune. God prints differences on each man's face. "Mr. Lee has said that the evil that man does lives after him, and the Bible says the sins of the father are visited upon the third and fourth generations. Tell me that the good deeds of the dead are buried with them? Tell me that in the great struggle for life you have never touched elbows with another; that your father's good deeds are buried with him. "My God, how horrible would be that thought—how horrible would be death. Where would you and I be to-day, but for the righteousness of our mother? Tell me that the dead woman's life is buried with her; that those little children will not be influenced by that mother? God have mercy on that household where the love and good of the mother is buried with her. "I tell you that the greatest evil that man ever did to those children was when he struck that blow to their mother. There is nothing on earth which so makes my heart revolt. There is nothing which can restore to those children the injury that their father has done them. "Now, my friend, Mr. Lee said that if ever there was a time you should watch yourselves, it is now. Gentlemen, you know that you have to watch yourselves all the time. And he said there was a rule of law that ninety-nine guilty had better escape than that one innocent man should suffer. That is not the rule of law. "Although the lawyers consumed nine hours in the delivery of their speeches, not once did they mention the word `justice.' All I ask at your hands is justice." Great emphasis was laid by Mr. Gilmer upon this question of the relations existing between the accused and his wife. He went over the evidence of the Commonwealth, tending to show that the relations were strained. By incident and illustration, he endeavored to lay before the court and the jury the picture of a home swept by discord; of a wife starving for the love she did not receive. He did not pretend to say that there were not times when the two were on friendly terms. On the contrary, he believed there were. In this connection, he referred to the letters introduced in court, he called attention to the fact that there were in the batch twenty-one letters from the wife and only fourteen from the husband. He repeatedly referred to the fact that the wife had to write one and one-half letters to get one from her husband. The testimony of the defense on this point was then taken up by Mr. Gilmer. He declared that it amounted to nothing. The negro butler evidently had eyes that did not want to see. The "handsome lady from Staunton," Mrs. Hanger, had said that she saw nothing. "Is it likely that the prisoner and his wife would have a fuss before her? Probably the poor, dead woman, when she heard the Staunton lady was coming, hunted up her pretty tidies, got out her handsome china and cut-glass, and put the best foot forward. The witness, he declared, was a woman who had never done wrong herself, and could see no wrong in others." "Take these letters," declared Mr. Gilmer in effect; "take these witnesses. Admitting all they say, they prove only that at these specific times these two people were on good terms; they cannot say anything more. As for the letters, look at them; the woman writes about love and the man about money. The tone of the latter is different; moreover, every one, except one, was written in July, 1900. They referred only to that particular time." Mr. Gilmer said it was good law and good reason to hold the man responsible for the safety of his wife. "When she married him he took her from her father's house, and it was his duty to protect her. If he did not, he had perpetrated a fraud upon her and upon her father, and had lied to his God. For such a sin he should be punished. "The jury," declared the speaker, "is not a `bump on a log.' It can decide for itself. The handwriting of Almighty God upon the face of McCue proclaimed him the murderer of his wife. He should be judged not only for this, but for robbing his children of a mother's love and guidance. Mercy is a different thing from justice. It was the province of a court to hand out justice; the Governor alone was the dispenser of mercy, where mercy was due. "The learned counsel of the other side," continued the Commonwealth's Attorney, "has told you that you will be criticised if you acquit this prisoner. I know, gentlemen, you will do your duty, despite the insinuating eloquence of lawyers. It is my duty to advise you and instruct you in the law. I want justice. I get the same fee, whether this man is acquitted or convicted. "I have known the prisoner for years, gentlemen. He has been my friend. I am here to protect him as much as I am to prosecute. I have worked for months to find some extenuating circumstances, but I have not been able to do so. I have prayed that his able and eloquent representatives produce here something to establish his innocence beyond a doubt. They have not done so; circumstances do not lie. I am going to show you that it was this man who chased his wife to the bath-room and then shot her down. He never had time to be unconscious. The bloody marks upon his shirt and the various stories he has given, prove his guilt. From Cain to Sam McCue, no murderer has been able to hide his act. God wrote it there on the bloody shirt, in the lack of time to be unconscious, and in the confused explanations he made." Before he concluded, Mr. Gilmer had something to say about the effort of Mr. Lee to prove by the Bible that any number of men are likely to draw different conclusions from the same thing. He recalled to the jury the fact that only two of the apostles were present at the crucifixion, and that their accounts of it were not written until thirty years later; while some of the stories were fuller than others, he said there was no contradiction, when they referred to the same things. Mr. Gilmer discussed the question of motive, and also from the viewpoint of the Commonwealth, reviewed the testimony of Martin and White concerning conversations in the jail. He declared that there was proof positive that the husband and wife were on bad terms, and proof positive that McCue had shot her down. He took up the instructions and went through the entire list, discussing the more important at length. Shortly before five o'clock, Mr. Gilmer announced that he could not complete his speech in less than an hour. The court thereupon ordered a recess until the following morning at 10 o'clock. Mr. Gilmer, in resuming his argument the next morning, said: "I am prepared to say at the outset that within an hour this case will be with you. It has been said that the accused is a man of influence, but that has nothing to do with the case. All men are equal before the law. "I lay down three propositions as to why you should bring in a verdict of murder in the first degree: "First—If he was not unconscious, he murdered his wife. "Second—The bloody shirt. "Third—The seven varying statements of the accused. "At 9:13 o'clock Sunday night, September 4th, Mr. and Mrs. McCue were at the gate of their residence. Later Mrs. McCue undressed, put on her night robe. This must have taken at least ten minutes. This would have put the time at about 9:23. No man could have choked and beaten and murdered that woman in less than ten minutes. And yet Dr. McCue had to be called on the 'phone, dress and walk to Sam McCue's house all within the seven minutes. The accused could not possibly have been unconscious. He did not have time to be unconscious. "It is a mathematical impossibility for Sam McCue to have been unconscious. Not only that—it is a medical impossibility. The evidence of Dr. C. S. Venable, Dr. J. E. Early and Dr. H. T. Nelson agree upon this. It is backed up by the testimony of Judge Duke and every witness who saw him that night. "If it had been a robber, why did he go in where the husband was when the light was burning; why take the time to set away the bat after he had used it; why did he take time to place the gun so carefully away unless it was to him a thing of value? Why did he leave without taking one thing of value? "It is absurd and ridiculous. But in addition, the burglar that you hear so much about goes down stairs, raises several windows without displacing the curtains, raises the windows without removing any bolts or breaking any fastenings. You can't believe it—it is too unreasonable. "The shirt is torn. Would the robber, think you, have had a tussle with so strong a man as the accused. The torn shirt shows a woman's hand." Here Mr. Gilmer demonstrated that the statement of Mrs. Massie about the sleeves of the accused being rolled up was true. He illustrated it by measuring the sleeve on the arm of Deputy Sergeant Wood. Mr. Gilmer knocked out the argument made by Mr. Sinclair on this point. Mr. Gilmer used the bloody gown and bloody shirt in a dramatic way to show that they pointed unmistakably to the guilt of the accused. "Just think of it, gentlemen," continued the lawyer; "the defense contends that the injury was done with a sandbag. If that be true, the robber would have been compelled to have used three different kind of weapons in less than seven minutes. He has a bat, a sandbag, both in his hand at the same time, and yet, not content with these weapons, he must needs get the third—a gun. "Although the neighbors are on the street, and the windows are all raised, yet the only cry heard that night was the cry of a woman in distress—a cry of a wife being brutally treated by him from whom she had every right to expect help. "When he saw the work of his hand, and saw the door of the penitentiary staring him in the face, he then completed his dastardly work. There is the motive. "Although Dan Grady was armed with club and pistol, he called for other help as he went to the house. Dr. F. C. McCue goes quietly to the scene of the crime without once raising an alarm. "If Sam McCue had not killed his wife, he would have gone to hunt her body, not sent another. He would not have waited two days before consenting to look upon her dead face." Mr. Gilmer closed the case with a beautiful and touching peroration. It was a pathetic appeal for justice. He said it was the saddest duty of his life. He did not thank the jury for their attentive consideration to what he had said. It was their duty, just as it was his duty to ask conviction at their hands. No man needed any other reward than the consciousness of duty well performed. "There are," said he, "two million people in Virginia to-day awaiting your verdict as a vindication of the law of this land." His last words of appeal for conviction were spoken in a tremulous, almost a tearful, whisper. The case was given to the jury at exactly 11:10 o'clock Saturday morning, November 5th, and five minutes later, after the gallery had been cleared, the jury filed into their room and the door closed behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. VERDICT—SENTENCE. Two Days of Painful and Pathetic Incidents—A Little Girl's Pitiful Situation—Tears and Pity—Back in Jail, with No Hope but in the Supreme Court. When J. Samuel McCue reached the court green on the morning of November 5th, the day on which his doom was pronounced by the unanimous vote of twelve of his peers, he was met by a number of ladies and gentlemen, who shook hands with him quite cordially. He kissed one of the ladies twice or thrice. His manner was calm, as it was on most occasions. It mattered not what his frame of mind—whether that of the religious enthusiast or the hunted man facing his pursuers—he was always deliberate, and made upon others the impression of nervous force and calm. In spite of the fact that this was to be probably the last day of the trial, the seats behind the bar were not so crowded as on the previous day, when even the lawyers interested in the case were inconvenienced. Perhaps many of the prisoner's relatives and friends felt unable to bear the strain. But faithful Mrs. Dinwiddie was prompt to arrive, as were also Mrs. R. D. Anderson and the ex-Mayor's sister-in-law, Mrs. E. O. McCue. Grimly hovering always on the fringe of the crowd or sitting in the rear seats of the space reserved for the bar, were Ernest Crawford and another brother of the murdered woman. A stern but orderly pair were these two young men. They wanted the law to hang McCue, but there was naught but calm determination on the faces of the Crawfords. They were biding their time. When Mr. Gilmer had ended his speech and the jury had retired to the little front room on the second floor of the courthouse to deliberate, the eyes of all were drawn to the pathetic group—the prisoner and his little family—over whom there was a terrible cloud, growing darker and darker as the slow moments went by. Willie McCue, who had done so much to save his father, was the oldest of the children, and he scarcely seventeen, but wonderfully mature for such tender years. Ruby McCue, not more than thirteen, a slight-figured, sensitive-looking girl, sat near her father, terribly conscious of the awful significance of the scene, and in racking, nervous suspense. Samuel O. gave no sign. The tender years of little Harry shielded him from very deep suffering. He probably did not know what it was all about. As the moments went by not a few, if not most, of those who in tense suspense awaited the announcement of doom, wondered if somebody— father, aunt, lawyer, somebody—would not see that the children were sent out of the court-room to escape a most painful and trying experience. McCue seemed utterly oblivious to the agony that would possibly be inflicted on his offsprings, especially on his sensitive little daughter. He fingered his testament, from which he read a verse to the constable who sat at his elbow; he spoke to his aunt or moved restlessly in his chair—but still the children remained. It is said he was the man of iron, unmoved, full of nerve and fight, while the jurors were framing their verdict, and, as it transpired, praying in the jury room, but those who looked closely saw more than one evidence of agony of suspense. The man who had said he wanted to be convicted or fully vindicated was hoping against despair that the jury would bring in a verdict of less than the first degree. The less than twenty minutes which the jury required to take its one ballot and to write out the formal announcement of the prisoner's doom seemed a much longer period to those who sat in silence in the crowded room. Court, lawyers, and spectators felt that they were awaiting something as serious as death—a decree as merciless as justice, as certain in its results as natural law. Ruby McCue was in tears, as were others of those who sat near the doomed man. Father and eldest son were outwardly almost calm. The jury filed in, while the nervous and intense suspense of the people grew more and more apparent, although no one spoke. During a tense three minutes the usual formalities were observed, and the foreman announced the verdict: "We, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, of murder in the first degree." A paper on which this terrible sentence was written was passed to the clerk, Richard W. Duke, grayer than his years warrant, and was read by him in a low voice, affected by his sense of the awfulness of it all—read to the ex-Mayor, ex-lawyer, ex-deacon, standing as straight as an Indian. He did not become hysterical or show any violent emotions, but he was not unmoved, whatever descriptive writers may say in their vivid way. He was not conscious of the bright sunshine which filtered through the dusty panes of the windows; it was all cloud. The winds were still, but there was a storm within, unseen but felt. He sat down with the same appearance of calm and indifference, while his female relatives bowed their heads and wept in their handkerchiefs, but when the little girl, whose very presence was the result of a cruel thoughtlessness, put her delicate little face against his and stained his GEORGE WATTS MORRIS, Judge Corporation Court of Charlottesville. cheek with the hot tears that wet her own, the iron restraint gave way, and the eyes that the jury had in effect declared had looked unrelentingly into the pleading ones of his wife filled with tears. Willie McCue, who has fought the battle of his life to save his father from the gallows and lost, trembled for a moment like a leaf shaken by the wind and then the pent-up grief burst its bounds and he buried his face in his hands and sobbed. Mrs. Dinwiddie, Mrs. Durrette, and Mrs. Edward O. McCue cried in sympathy. The brothers of the prisoner stood silently and with strained faces and tearless eyes, gazing at vacancy. Nearly every man on the jury was weeping. There was no longer suspense, but an awful certainty, if the verdict of the jury was followed by the sentence of the court. Mr. Lee at last got to his feet and asked permission for the lawyers for the defense to retire for a consultation of half an hour. This was granted, and these gentlemen, together with E. O. McCue, a brother of the accused, withdrew from the court-room. Judge Morris considerately gave the jury permission to retire from the building, but requested them to remain within call. It was a half hour of untold misery for all who remained; and, strange to say, in spite of the painful situation, few withdrew. It was a fascinating, if painful, scene, and if there was more of the drama to come no one seemed willing to miss even the smallest detail. The silence was awful and unbroken, except for the weeping of the prisoner's relatives within the bar, who awaited the return of the lawyers and the next move of the actors. The prisoner read his Bible occasionally and often caressed his children. A few minutes past noon the lawyers returned to court and moved to set aside the verdict on various grounds, and asked the court to set a time to hear argument on the motion. The 9th day of November was agreed upon, and court adjourned to that day. Then McCue arose to leave the room for his quarters in the city jail. The parting with his relatives had the appearance of a final farewell. They wept, and throughout the crowded room there were others whose tears flowed, not in sympathy for the criminal, but as a manifestation of the divine emotion of pity. Only one man, however, expressed his pity in another way. This was John A. Traylor, a Richmond juror, who went forward, shook hands with the relatives, and then offered his hand to the man whom he had just voted to hang. McCue took it and said: "You have done me a great injustice." "That rested with you," answered Mr. Traylor. "I did my duty as I saw it." On the outside in the court yard a large throng lined up on each side of the way to the jail to see the little procession pass. There was no sound or sign of approval or disapproval; simply silence and alert attention. The sad procession was led by the Rev. Dr. George L. Petrie, the prisoner's pastor, who had awaited him at the side door of the courtroom. With the condemned man were Sergeant C. W. Rogers, several policemen, three of the McCue brothers, W. O. Durrette, a cousin, and William and Harry McCue. They passed through the crowd of thoroughly awed people, McCue moving with a lagging step. It was a pitiful request the condemned man made of the City Sergeant when he asked that his little boy Harry might be allowed to go into his cell with him. "Would to God I could grant your request," said the City Sergeant, "but I cannot. I must refuse you." The prisoner's eyes moistened; that was all. He shook hands with his friends and over and over kissed little Harry and William. A minute later he passed through the door of the stone bastile and was alone in his cell. The prisoner again emerged from the jail on the 9th day of November, the day on which the motion of his counsel for a new trial was considered by the court. The courthouse was packed as usual. The lawyers for the prisoner came in early, bearing files of newspapers and many law books. The lawyers for the State were promptly on hand. The ex-Mayor entered in the custody of Jailor J. J. Thomas and several policemen. He looked serious, and did not kiss his relatives and friends as he had done during the long days of his trial. After the court had been in session some time, Mrs. Marshall Dinwiddie, Mrs. E. O. McCue, Mrs. R. D. Anderson, and little Ruby McCue arrived and took their seats behind the bar near the prisoner. The little girl kissed her father. This was the first kiss the ex-Mayor had received that day. The defense put two of the deputies who had been in charge of the jury on the stand to testify as to the reading of newspapers, submitted files of the newspapers the jurors were said to have access to, and asked that a new trial be awarded. The court refused the application. The decision to refuse another trial put an end to all hope of a judicial interference with the verdict unless the Supreme Court shall grant a writ of error. The ladies, knowing what was inevitable, withdrew, and one of the counsel for the defense, prompted by merciful and pitying sentiment, arranged for the withdrawal of the children before the painful scene soon to be enacted. A profound silence settled over the mise-en-scene—a silence that was awful. "J. Samuel McCue, stand up," said Judge Morris in a voice that trembled. "Have you anything to say why the court should not now proceed to pass sentence upon you." The prisoner stood up, very pale. His eyes filled with tears. "Yes, sir." His voice quivered or trembled, and it was low. "I have to say that I am as thoroughly innocent of this offence as any other man in this courthouse, and that I hope some day I will have an opportunity to vindicate my innocence." Judge Morris continued: "The point of your guilt or innocence is a matter that was left to the jury. This court, thank God, did not have to pass upon it. The jury have decided after fair and impartial trial that you are guilty of the offence, and it only remains for me to pass the sentence of the law, which is that you be taken to the county jail of Albemarle county, which is also used as the city jail of Charlottesville, and therein remain in solitary confinement until the 20th day of January next; that on that day, between the hours of sunrise and sunset, you be taken from your place of confinement to some place within the enclosure of the said jail and there be hanged by your neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy on your soul." It was about 12:45 when sentence was passed, and court adjourned a few minutes later. When Judge Morris descended from the bench the prisoner accosted him and petitionel for more liberty at the jail, saying that it was an awful place, and that he had not been used to that sort of thing. He wanted to be permitted to take more exercise in the jail yard. The Judge said that he would be as lenient as the law allowed. "But," he added, "you know the law." Then, extending his hand, he said: "I want to shake hands with you for the first time and say how deeply I regret this whole thing." The prisoner was then returned to jail to await, in the harrowing suspense with which he has now become familiar, the result of the efforts of his lawyers before the Supreme Court of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. AFTER THE VERDICT. Will Neither Be Hanged Nor Commit Suicide—New Trial Expected by Lawyers for Accused—Bill of Exception—Life in the Jail. "I shall not be hanged, and I shall not commit suicide." Such were the words spoken by J. Samuel McCue a few hours after he had been convicted of murder in the first degree. And thus it appears that the ex-Mayor, after all he has undergone, and despite the tears he shed on the day the jury brought in its verdict, was soon himself again. Indeed, if a certain town official's statements are accurate, it did not take the prisoner long to recover his equanimity. This authority says that shortly after the trial was over, McCue began whistling, as of yore, and that he soon seemed as cheerful as a cricket. The supposed wife-murderer confidently expects to get a new trial, and he declares that if the Supreme Court decides his way, he does not intend to try his chances again in Charlottesville. The next time he will ask for a change of venue. He, as well as his counsel, appear to think that the jury trying the case breathed an atmosphere tainted with prejudice, and that however conscientious the twelve men might be, they could not prevent themselves from becoming affected by their environments. J. L. Lee, one of the prisoner's lawyers, said as much in his argument. He told the jurors to watch themselves carefully, and appeared to think it altogether improbable that they could hold themselves aloof from local influences. This warning, however well intended it may have been, surprised the jurors. One of them said, a short while after the verdict had been handed in, that it was not until Mr. Lee made this remark that he and his associates knew there was any feeling about the murder of Mrs. McCue in this city. They had seen no signs of animosity on the part of the crowds in the court-room, and from the demeanor of the spectators, could not tell whether they were for or against the accused. Once, and only once, there occurred what Judge Morris severely designated as a "demonstration." Captain Woods and Mr. Lee were having a little "spat," and the former made a sharp retort. For just about two seconds there was a mild effort on the part of some to applaud Captain Woods. This, however, seemed to be designed not as a scheme to show feeling against McCue, but merely to express admiration for the Charlottesville lawyer. McCue's counsel, nevertheless, appeared to be shocked by the incident, and forthwith demanded that a note of the matter be put in the stenographic record. The court agreed to this, but told the stenographer to use the words "slight applause." And that just about expressed it. Great stress seems to be laid by the defense upon the fact that certain jurors during the trial were permitted to read the newspapers, although the evidence shows that none of them went beyond the headlines ALBEMARLE COUNTY JAIL. Window of McCue's Cell to Left. of the case as reported, and although each juror testified that he had observed to the letter his oath upon the subject. Judge Morris, at the beginning of the trial, gave the members of the jury permission to read newspapers, provided they would avoid the report of the trial as far as possible—i. e., all except the headlines. This they did. It is interesting to note that this permission was granted in open court, in the presence of the accused and his counsel, and without objection or exception by them at the time. It is the opinion now of certainly two of the ablest lawyers at the Charlottesville Bar, who had no connection with the case, that a failure to except at the time cures any error, if error there really was, in the liberty granted by the Judge. One of the professors of law at the University of Virginia is strongly of the opinion that the Supreme Court will find no error in the instructions allowed by Judge Morris. "They were," said he, "extremely fair and liberal to the accused. Apparently every doubt was solved in favor of the prisoner, as it should have been, and the wisest precaution seemed to have been taken to give the defense no excuse for an appeal on the grounds of unfair or improper instructions." Any other treatment of Willie McCue than that which he received at the hands of Captain Woods and Captain Ker, would have been unfortunate. Several members of the jury expressed themselves in terms of sympathy for the unfortunate boy, who found himself placed in such an awkward position. They all agreed, however, that if he really knew, and had told to others, damaging things against his father, he would have appeared in a much better light to have refused to testify on the stand upon those points, and to have gone to jail, if necessary, for contempt of court. "Was your opinion of the guilt of the prisoner shaken at all by the affectionate letters from the accused to his wife in the years 1900 and 1901," inquired a reporter of a juror who had frankly confessed, after the trial, that he had completely lost his heart to an attractive widow who had been a daily occupant of the bar. "Not in the least," he replied. "One of the meanest and most unfaithful men I ever knew—one who was, at times, brutal in his treatment of his wife—never failed to write her in terms of endearment whenever they were separated. You can't tell much about what a husband is from the letters he writes his wife when absent. That may be the only time he does love her." Whatever may be the feeling in this community as to the guilt of the accused, and as to the justice of the verdict, there is deep and profound sympathy for the loved ones—especially for the innocent children affected by it. Mr. John L. Lee was seen at the clerk's desk, after adjournment of court Friday evening, crying as if his heart would break. Little Ruby McCue had gone to him and pressed his hand in grateful appreciation of his speech and it had completely unnerved the Lynchburg lawyer. No one who saw the jurors, after they had rendered their verdict, with the tears streaming down their faces, could doubt that they had performed one of the most disagreeable duties of their lives. There could not have been found in Virginia twelve men who would have been more conscientious. One of the jurors said that the explanation of instructions by Commonwealth's Attorney Gilmer and his summing up of the evidence in the case made his speech, in the opinion of the juror, the most effective that was delivered for the prosecution. Another juror said that the "bloody shirt" did more to convict McCue than any other one thing. "The verdict," said a prominent citizen of Virginia, "is a tribute to the courage and conscience of the jury, and a remarkable vindication of the law. It shows that wealth, social position and political influence cannot sway a jury in Virginia from the path of duty." While the lawyers for the defense did not, of course, express an opinion, it is generally believed that they were fully prepared for the verdict. After the verdict, and the lawyers for the defense had held a conference, Mr. Coleman arose and said: "If your Honor please, on behalf of the accused, we submit these motions to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial upon the following grounds: 1. Because the verdict is contrary to law and evidence. 2. Errors of court during progress of the trial as to evidence and questions. 3. Misdirection of the court in the matter of instructions. 4. Refusal of court to give certain instructions asked for by the accused. 5. Because of amendments made to instructions asked for by the accused. "There is one other ground," said Mr. Coleman, "upon which I will ask the court to set aside the verdict. We are, however, not prepared just at this time to argue the matter, nor is our proof in hand. Indeed, we are not quite sure whether we can establish this point. "We shall also ask that the verdict be set aside because the jury was permitted to read newspapers; also because the court refused to discharge the jury in view of the statement made by Captain Woods with respect to his refusing a retainer. "I don't know whether he said a retainer from the defense or not. He was stopped before he got that far. The stenographer recorded the incident—his report will show." "Is that your motion?" asked Judge Morris, when Mr. Coleman had finished. "It is," said Mr. Coleman. "If your Honor please, we want to argue these motions." "I will give you all the time you want," replied the Judge. Commonwealth's Attorney Gilmer said that he was anxious for McCue's counsel to have their charges fully investigated, whereupon the Judge began the examination of the jurors as to whether they had read the papers. The jurors all declared that they were not influenced by what they had seen in the newspapers, and that the few who had read any newspapers had confined themselves strictly to the parts which did not relate to the trial. One or two had seen the headlines of the trial reports, and one had read a part of Mr. Lee's speech for the prisoner. It was agreed that the motion for a new trial should be argued on Wednesday, November 9th. On that date counsel for the defense submitted a motion for a new trial without argument, after Mr. Lee had offered in support of his motion copies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Richmond News-Leader and Charlottesville Progress, between the dates of October 18th and November 5th. Policeman O. M. Wood, a deputy in charge of the jury, was sworn and testified. He had seen several of the jurors read the newspapers. Could not recall who they were. The principal paper read was the Richmond Times-Dispatch. They bought copies of the Progress containing photographs of the jury, but did not read them; sent them to friends. Witness recalled that Mr. Parsons bought a few copies of the Richmond News-Leader on one occasion. He read about a reservoir bursting at Winston, N. C. Mr. Wood warned the jurors not to read anything about the trial. "So far as I know, none of the jurors read anything about the case," said he. L. W. Noel, another deputy, said in reply to a question by Judge Morris, that the principal paper read by the jury was the Petersburg Index-Appeal. They did not read anything about the trial. Judge Morris took up each objection, one at a time, reviewed them carefully and overruled them in each instance. Mr. Coleman for the defense then moved an arrest of judgment for error apparent on face of the record. Mr. Coleman argued, in support of his motion in arrest of judgment, that the jury had brought in a verdict of "guilty as charged," and since the indictment did not state whether it was murder in the first degree or not, the court could not sentence him to be hanged. The court promptly overruled the motion, stating that the verdict was perfectly plain as to its intent, by saying "guilty of murder in the first degree." Judge Morris then told the prisoner to stand up and hear the sentence. Sentence was then passed upon him. No prisoner in the Albemarle county jail has ever been so carefully and systematically guarded as J. Samuel McCue. In addition to the jailer and his assistant, Policeman O. M. Wood and Constable B. E. Jeffries were employed as extra guards to patrol the jail yard each night. There is no regular death watch at McCue's cell door at this time, and it is true that a curtain shuts out the view from the corridor into the cell. But the cell itself is said to be the safest in the jail, and some time prior to the date fixed for execution, the custom of having a death watch will be complied with. Judge Morris' orders were that no one be permitted to see the prisoner without being first duly searched, and that every one see him in the presence of the jailer except his attorneys, who have the right, under the law, his three youngest children and the Rev. H. B. Lee and the Rev. Dr. G. L. Petrie, the prisoner's pastor. The Judge issued orders, further, that McCue be allowed regular exercise, under proper guard, in the jail enclosure. His meals are furnished him from his former home on Park street. The above constitute the sum total of the liberties allowed the prisoner. "I shall do everything," said Judge Morris, "for the health and comfort of the condemned man that the law allows. I have no idea or purpose of making his lot at the jail any harder than is necessary in order to secure his absolute safety. He is guarded strictly by the best men that could be employed, and to deny him the comforts of proper furnishings of his cell and the healthfulness of exercise would be unnecessary cruelty. Certainly, I have no idea of varying my rules in these particulars." City Sergeant Rogers, while having no authority over the county jail, has been ready and willing at all times to give any assistance to the proper authorities. He says that no prisoner was ever more securely guarded than McCue; that his escape, under the circumstances, would be practically an impossibility. It is not thought that McCue has any desire to escape; that he is hopeful of a new trial, and, ultimately, of his acquittal. Still, the authorities will take no chances, and the public may rest assured that the guards have a full appreciation of their responsible duties. Judge Morris signed the bill of exceptions for the defense on November 10th. They numbered forty-six. The appeal, if granted, will come before the Court of Appeals in Richmond January 5th. The Corporation Clerk, in making transcripts of the record, had to copy all orders in his office from the time of the return of the indictment by the grand jury to the court to the final order sentencing the prisoner. Included in these orders are those of adjournment from day to day, including the swearing of sergeants to take control of the jurymen and to see that they did not talk with any one about the case, and showing the fact that the prisoner was in court when each order was entered, and also that at the adjournment of court he was remanded to jail. The orders also show what exceptions the defense made and their reasons therefor. The evidence includes nine hundred pages, and it is estimated that the record will reach fifteen hundred pages. The counsel for the defense will have to present their petition to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, setting forth what they claim are errors in the records, and their reasons and the law therefor.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. SOME PICKED-UP STITCHES. Mrs. Marshall Again—Cost of the Trial—Alleged Forgery and Other Financial Matters—Mortgages—Fees of Attorneys—The McCue-Burnley Letter. Reference has already been made to an indirect connection between Mrs. Hattie Marshall, wife of Lester Marshall, and the McCue case. This grew out of publications in several newspapers which referred to a letter addressed to J. Samuel McCue and entrusted to a jail guard for delivery. The papers seemed to have some authority for intimating that the contents almost put the missive into the class of love letters. Mrs. Marshall indignantly denied the impeachment, and gave out the following for publication over her own signature: "I wish to correct the mistake that was printed in yesterday's papers. As for my writing Mr. J. Samuel McCue a love letter or being a warm friend of his that is false. I think I can give good account of who started this rumor, and I certainly did send Mr. McCue a business letter concerning some business matters. I tried to get to see him, but could not get in, and I am ashamed to think my name was so badly used. Thanking you for your kindness, Resp." To the newspaper men she explained that it was a brief note inquiring the amount she still owed him on a sum borrowed to pay a police court fine for her husband, and for which she had hypothecated her gold watch. Mrs. Marshall seemed glad to explain things. "I have been done a great injustice by all this talk," said she, "and I know who is at the bottom of it. The offender is my husband. He is seeking to ruin my reputation. So far from my being in love with Mr. McCue, I have never written to him but once in my life. That is the letter referred to in the papers. I gave it to one of the jail officials for delivery. It had reference to a watch of mine which the prisoner has. "How absurd and unjust it is to injure my reputation by cruel reports," added Mrs. Marshall, when "I have just been in Charlottesville one week after a three weeks' visit to Orange county. "And the idea of my being in love with Mr. McCue! I hardly know him except in a business way. He collected some rents on property belonging to my mother and was our lawyer. Indeed, he was to have represented me in my suit against my husband, but his arrest prevented his acting." The following is a copy of the letter which the jail guard says was handed him for delivery to J. Samuel McCue by Mrs. Hattie Marshall, and which is now published for the first time: "Dear Friend: "I do not wish to worry you, as I know you have worries enough, but I do think you ought to send me my watch, as it is all I have to pay Mr. Harmon to get me free from the treacherous man I have. Now, if you won't send it to me send me word how much you want me to pay you. "I have the little picture of you, and it is all the comfort I can get is to look at it and something else, you understand, that is so much like you. "Oh! If I could see you just 10 minutes, what a pleasure it would be to me. Send me an answer by —, as I will get it all right. Just write to me and no one will see it but me, and I will burn it up as soon as I read it. "God bless you, my dear. I will live in the hopes of seeing you some day. I pray for you every night, and shall do so. L— (probably Lester) has left town. I have been away over a month. Answer please and let me know. Just always remember I am your true friend until death. H. "P. S.—Can't half write. Answer to-morrow." * * * C. L. DeMott, City Engineer of Charlottesville, prepared several diagrams showing the McCue premises and their relation to other localities involved in the case. The plan of the second floor of the McCue residence as made by Mr. DeMott is printed in this volume. There is only one error in this plan. The blood-stained bat is indicated as found in the bath-room, when in fact it was in the bed chamber. The Engineer's drawings show that Skinner, in his room on the lot of F. B. Moran, where, he testified, he heard some one crying at the McCue residence, was 100 feet from the bath-room where the murder was committed, and that the residences of F. A. Massie, W. J. Keller, C. G. Maphis, Judge R. T. W. Duke, and others were in hailing distance on the same street. The residence of T. J. Williams, the only person outside of the family notified, was shown to be one-half mile from the scene of the murder. While on the stand Mr. DeMott, after identifying his drawings, testified as follows: "I went to the bath-room in the McCue residence at the request of Commonwealth's Attorney Gilmer and turned on the hot-water spigot. It took twenty-five minutes and fifteen seconds to fill the tub. There was a stoppage of about forty seconds during this time. I infer that it would require nearly twenty-five minutes to fill the tub if nothing was in it. Measurement on the tub shows that it contains about forty-five gallons of water, up to the overflow point. With a body weighing about 115 pounds in the water the same quantity of water would be displaced. "This would make about twelve gallons less in the tub, provided it was up to the point of overflow. It would therefore take about sixteen minutes to fill the tub if the whole body was immersed. It overflows when about two-thirds full. "There was no difference in time to fill the bath tub whether the spigot was turned up or down. In the week days the steam pump is running, and the pressure is about the same then as at night. It would therefore probably be about the same on the Sunday night of the murder as at this time." The following was published in several papers as a probable explanation of some things which the evidence did not make entirely clear: There never has been a satisfactory explanation of why the water was turned on in the bath tub, and why it was that the tub, which requires fifteen or twenty minutes to fill from the spigot, was full in so much shorter time than that, assuming, as has been done, that the spigot was turned on after the shot. A theory which was not examined before or during the trial, it seems, is now based upon the testimony of Mr. Frank A. Massie, a part of which was to the effect that while walking in his yard across the street from the McCue residence and a short time before the news of the crime spread abroad, he saw some one rush out of the lane which runs down beside the McCue residence and up the street in the direction of Dr. Frank McCue's home. The theory referred to is to this effect: That if the murderer was J. Samuel McCue, as the jury and the people believe, he had beaten his wife and choked her until he thought her dead, and put her in the bath tub and turned on the water to make either the impression that she had committed suicide or to drown her, should a spark of life remain, after which he rushed up Park street a square and a half, and, reaching the Doctor's, then ensued the conversation which was heard by Dr. McCue's wife while she was undressing to go to bed. This conversation, she said, took place at the 'phone. It is believed that what she took for the telephone bell was the door bell, and that Dr. McCue's brief answer, "All right," was made to his brother at the door. Returning home, so runs the hypothesis, McCue found his wife not dead, but outside of the tub, which helps to account for the wet condition of the bath-room floor, as to which all agree. Then followed the appeal, which Charles Perry heard, not to kill her, as she would die anyhow; and then, too, followed the gunshot which put an end to all. If this story be true it was during the brief time that McCue required to go to his brother's home for pretended aid—or for whatever purpose— that Charles Skinner heard the crying for from three to five minutes. It is held to be entirely improbable that a man in a murderous frenzy would have permitted the crying of his victim for a period of even so long as this. * * * The following are the principal items of cost attending the McCue trial: Fauquier venire, $212.28; Fredericksburg venire, $401.60; Richmond venire, $438.44; Petersburg venire, $497.20; jury, mileage and attendance, $321.20; witnesses for Commonwealth (estimated), $100; guards at jail, $150; Commonwealth's Attorney fee, $10; Clerk Corporation Court, $2.50; board bill for jurors, $150. Total, $2,283.22. In addition to the above, the city of Charlottesville undertook to assist the jurors in paying their board bills, and to foot the bills for extra policemen. The cost of the stenographers was borne jointly by the prosecution and the defense, and amounted to several hundred dollars. The pay of the jurors was inadequate to meet their legitimate expenses. * * * On the 14th of September, 1904, ten days after the murder, a deed of trust was recorded in the corporation clerk's office from J. Samuel McCue for $12,500 in favor of the attorneys employed in his defense, naming the amount each was to receive for his service; that is to say, Daniel Harmon $5,000, John L. Lee $5,000, Walker &amp; Sinclair $2,500. (It has already been stated that on account of illness Daniel Harmon was compelled to withdraw from the case when the prosecution was ready to put on its first witness, and that J. Tinsley Coleman of Lynchburg became one of the counsel for the defense.) These mortgages covered nearly all the real estate of the ex-Mayor in Charlottesville and Albemarle save the dwelling and lot on Park street formerly occupied by the accused and his late wife as a residence. This was deeded to Mrs. McCue by her husband on June 20th, 1903, with the following proviso: "If I survive my said wife then, at her death, the whole of the property hereby conveyed, whatever may be its form at that time, shall revert to and thereafter belong to me just as though this deed had never been made." The property thus reverts to Mr. McCue at this time. By a deed filed in the corporation Clerk's office and recorded later McCue conveyed to his brother, Police Justice E. O. McCue, certain lots in Charlottesville to secure payment of a bond for $2,500. Mr. McCue also conveyed to his brother his law library, valued at $500 and three bookcases. The original deed of trust is in the prisoner's handwriting. * * * A few days after his arrest, when speculation as to the nature of his defense was indulged in, it was believed that the plea of insanity would be entered. It was a fact published in the newspapers that his attorneys visited the Western State Hospital at Staunton and investigated the records to learn to what extent, if any, the antecedents of the accused had undergone treatment at that institution. While the people on the street corners in Charlottesville were discussing this phase of the case the accused lawyer was examining papers and running off letters on his typewriter. There seemed to no sort of pretense on his part that he was not responsible. It seems that there was quite a run on the clerk's office of this city for information by clients of the accused attorney. They were searching the records to see how he had disposed of business intrusted to him. McCue in the last five years, it is said, did the largest loan business of any lawyer at the Charlottesville bar, as well as the largest business in collections. McCue had been regarded as a wealthy man. What the present status of his financial condition is, may be inferred from the mortgages he has given. A prominent young lawyer of Charlottesville declared soon after the arrest that he owed him a good deal of money and that suits involving about $10,000 will be instituted against him at the next term of the court. The ex-Mayor, he believed, owed a total approximating, or perhaps, exceeding $50,000. Somewhat related to the above story, is the one to the effect that the accused admits signing his wife's name to negotiable notes due the banks of Charlottesville to the amount of $12,000, and without her authority. It is said that the lawyers, representing the claims of the bank, called at the jail about a week after the trial, and inquired of the prisoner if the signature of his wife was genuine or authorized, and that he replied that he had endeavored to secure the endorsement of his wife; that she had refused to sign, and that he had personally signed her name. These notes were presented to the administrator of the murdered woman who informed the holders that, in his opinion, the signatures were not made by Mrs. McCue. * * * Some time before the trial the accused addressed the following letter to W. Sam Burnley, a Charlottesville attorney and justice of the peace: "Your letter of several days since was received, and I should have answered ere this, but my poor heart has been too severely crushed and my spirits too severely depressed. In fact, I have been dazed. My irreparable loss in the death of my darling wife was sorrow sufficient, much less this awful persecution that is being heaped upon me. "If God be for us, who can be against us?" I must desist, however, lest I murmur. `For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.' `If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as sons; for what son is he whom the Lord chasteneth not?' `I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.' `And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God—and He knows that I love Him better than I do my uneventful existence. My dear boy, can it be that we have been striving too much for the perishable and not sufficiently for the imperishable? If so, let us each see that we make no mistake in the future. " `What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul, or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?' "You and I, old fellow, have had some serious moments and talks together, for all of which I am truly thankful. I would they had been more frequent. "God be with you till we meet again." Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom; Lead, thou, me on; The night is dark, and I am far from home; Lead, thou, me on; Keep thou my feet, I do not ask to see the distant scene; One step enough for me. So long Thy power hath blessed me, Sure it still, will lead me on O'er moor and fen; o'er crag and torrent, Till the night is gone, And with the morn those angel faces smile. Which I have loved long since and lost awhile. These I infer are the dear ones who have preceded us, and are interceding for, and beckoning us on, and somehow in faith's sweet vision I can discern "the silver lining," and when I am released and my innocence vindicated, how dearly I shall praise Him, so pray for me and my dear little motherless ones, my brother in Christ, as I shall pray for you. I had one of the purest and best mothers that ever existed, and so was my dear and darling wife. They are pleading right earnestly for me now; how faithfully I must strive to meet and dwell with them again; I do so dearly love and cherish their sacred memories. Improve the present, dear boy, do your very best for your faithful, dutiful wife. She is a good, honest woman, I have seen it plainly written on her face, and she is the mother of your darling children, which means so much. I enclose you the statement as requested. I remain your sincere friend and brother in Christ. * * * Clerk R. W. Duke, in his official capacity, has to keep the weapon and also the bloody shirt and gown which figured in the case. Until all hope of new trials has been abandoned and the ex-Mayor finds himself face to face with the gallows, he must preserve these ghastly souvenirs of the killing, which have now assumed the dignity of legal "exhibits." Mr. Duke declares that he will burn the gown and shirt as soon as he can. As for the gun, he does not know what will become of it. The weapon under a certain statute now becomes the property of the Commonwealth. Judge Morris, perhaps, would have the authority to return the weapon, which is an expensive magazine gun, to the McCue family. GEORGE E.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. OPINIONS OF STATE PRESS. The following are the comments of some of the Virginia press on the verdict of murder in the first degree in the McCue murder case: Norfolk Virginia-Pilot:. We are persuaded that the verdict is one that will appeal to the common sense of every citizen who has followed the evidence in the case. Clifton Forge Review: J. Samuel McCue says: "I shall not be hanged and I shall not commit suicide." He must have an idea of imitating John Kennedy, the train-wrecker. Petersburg Index-Appeal: Well, the McCue jury did the job with neatness and dispatch, much to the discomfiture, if not the disgust, of the fifty-year-old dame who had represented the Petersburg contingent and Petersburg men generally as being a weak, nerveless, and bad lot. Portsmouth Star: At present Samuel McCue lies convicted of the foulest and most despicably cowardly crime which a man can commit. There are few worst than that of killing a wife. No matter if he should get new trials and delays and finally escape hanging, he still bears the mark of the murderer. He cannot recover from the stain of his wife's blood. He convicted himself. He could not avoid it; he's guilty. Norfolk Landmark: While the prompt conviction of ex-Mayor McCue, of Charlottesville, on the charge of murder in the first degree was expected by a good many lawyers who had followed the case, it was a surprise, we think, to most persons. The general belief is that McCue killed his wife, but many do not feel satisfied that the evidence established guilt. The jury, however, was composed of Virginians free from the local bias, and the quick verdict is an indication that the circumstantial evidence was very strong. It is proverbially hard to secure a verdict of murder in the first degree. Richmond Times-Dispatch: For our part, as a Virginia newspaper, we deeply regret that McCue was not able to establish his innocence beyond the peradventure of a doubt, for it is a blot upon the history of Virginia that one of her citizens, a man of education and standing, a man who had held public office, a man who was surrounded by the best and most inspiring influences of home and church and refined society, should have been convicted by a jury of twelve men, coming from different parts of the State, and who could not have been swayed by local prejudices, of a crime so unnatural, so unmanly, so brutal, and so cowardly. Danville Register: It seems that the court is asked to set aside the verdict in the McCue case because the jurors read newspapers and saw the head-lines of the reports of the trial. So far as we have observed, the press of the State has handled this case in a fair, conservative manner. There has been no attempt on the part of the newspapers to convict the accused, although now that a verdict has been rendered the jury's finding is generally commended as righteous. This shows that McCue has been regarded as a guilty man, deserving the fate which seems to await him, but no attempt has been made to prejudice the case. Fredericksburg Star: The crime of which he has been convicted is so unspeakable in its horrible details, and is so seldom heard of within the confines and borders of the South, where chivalry and reverence for women, absence of divorce scandals and happy homes have been the distinguishing traits of our people and the prevailing conditions in our midst, that we stood appalled when the charge was made in this case, and we bow our heads in sorrow that a fair minded and intelligent jury, representing the citizenship of various sections of the State, should have found the evidence against the accused man, in spite of all the presumptions of innocence in his favor, so strong that they felt it their bounden duty under their oath to find him guilty. Richmond News Leader: Now that the man is doomed public feeling has turned from fierce resentment and demand for vengeance for one of the most cruel and shocking crimes in our annals to profound pity for the man himself and sympathy for those who must suffer for him and with him. There is no relenting. The feeling is that the man has been convicted justly and should die for his crime but it is tempered by that decorous awe with which the uncalloused mind always is impressed in the presence of impending death. Virginians are the kindliest and best behaved people in the world. From one end of the State to the other men and women alike are inexorably stern in their demand that this man shall die for the dreadful crime he has done, shall pay with his life for his violation of the laws of God and man. But he has not and will not be insulted and nowhere is there any tendency to gloating or exultation. Roanoke Times: Pity is the most catholic of human emotions. It strains the realms of its vast jurisdiction to almost infinite and divine proportions—but not far enough to cover a criminal so black in heart as the man who killed Mistress Fannie McCue. It cannot enter his cell without a feeling of repulsion. It cannot look upon the felon, and keep a stranger with loathing. It cannot throw its heavenly angeis about him when knowing that he it is who, in the full plentitude of his strength, permitted not one spark or ray or scintilla of mercy to enter his murderous purpose, when like human devil and to the accompaniment of most hideous brutality, he ushered the soul of a loving wife from the home circle, from the care of her offspring, and from station of earthly respect into the grim portals of eternity. Thoughts of this man's children may bring the tear of unutterable sympathy to the eye of the public, but it is in no way related to the individuality of Samuel McCue, nor in any sense for him. College Topics: And lastly, the State of Virginia has something to be thankful for. It is not everywhere that such a tragedy could be followed by such a restraint and respect for law; it is not everywhere that a court could sit in such a session with no thought of violence, that a community calling for justice could stop to feel and express its sympathy for those whose hearts have been torn by the awful horror of it all. Out of this turmoil of evidence and argument, of tears and crushed heart, we emerge with a clearer view and a larger sense of the dignity of the law and the sterness of justice. Green County Register: The verdict, which puts J. Samuel McCue in the death cell to await his death hanging for the murder of his wife, throws a new light on the criminal proceedings of Virginia courts and sets aside any apprehension that there may be in the minds of the police as to the courts of our Commonwealth being biased in favor of wealth or social position. Suffolk Herald: That the horrible, dastardly deed was actually committed by the prisoner the evidence strongly points and hardly admits of a doubt, and whatever quibbling there may be as to the technical differences of opinion as to the Commonwealth establishing a case of sufficient merit as to warrant a verdict of murder in the first degree, we are of the opinion that McCue is responsible for the death of Fannie Crawford McCue—his wife—and ought to suffer the penalty of death, as an expiation of his foul deed. Culpeper Enterprise: This was one of the most sensational trials Virginia has witnessed in many years—and a more brutal murder was never perpetrated within the borders of the Commonwealth. The verdict met with universal approval, as he is generally believed to be guilty, and that justice demands that he pay the penalty of the heinous crime. While there is but little sympathy expressed for him, the people of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, and throughout the State shed tears of sympathy for the sadly afflicted children, upon whom the sins of the father rest so heavily. Newport News Daily Press: McCue was given the benefit of all the technicalities of the law. His counsel could not build up in the mind of a single one of the twelve jurors a doubt sufficient to make a second ballot necessary. It is unfortunate for the children of the condemned man, but he should have thought of the influence of his mad deed upon them before committing it, instead of parading their innocence in the court-room in a vain endeavor to escape the just punishment of a heinous crime. Staunton Dispatch-News: We have no doubt the statement of the McCue juror to the effect that the jury had no idea whatever of the strong local feeling against McCue until Mr. Lee, one of McCue's lawyers, stated the fact and dwelt strongly on it in his speech, will bring relief to the people of this State. There has been a feeling that the earnest desire of the people of Charlottesville to see McCue convicted may have its effect on the jury and if there is one thing above another that characterizes the people of this State, it is their desire that every accused man shall have a fair trial. There seems no room now for the slightest doubt that McCue has had a fair trial, and that being the case, there is a feeling that he ought to suffer the penalty. Farmville Herald: When this heinous crime was first made known to the public we gave the simple fact to our readers without comment but now that a jury of the poor man's peers has pronounced him guilty of murder in the first degree we are free to say that we do not know how twelve honest and intelligent men could have reached any other conclusion. The simple statement of the transactions of that fatal evening in that, let us hope, once happy home carried conviction to every honest mind. No one we have met with has reached any other conclusion, and as the twelve jurors were nothing more nor less than twelve citizens selected from the great mass of citizenship it would have been monstrous if their verdict had been otherwise. Alexandria Gazette: It is hard to understand how a man can be so bloodthirsty as to deliberately plan to murder the mother of his four children, and there is every reason to believe that McCue committed the deed in a fit of frenzy and not as a result of deliberation. What caused the setting on fire of the course of nature remains to be discovered. These observations must in no sense be taken as any excuse for or extenuation of McCue's terrible crime. He is wholly responsible for his deed and will doubtless receive the full penalty of the law. No matter what may have caused the foul deed, the unfortunate wife had committed no offense to cause him to raise his hand against her. The turning of the searchlight upon McCue's private life after he was arraigned for uxoricide has placed him in a position to receive but little sympathy from his fellow-creatures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. An Interesting Legal Question Involving Nearly $100,000—The Lawyers Divided in Opinion as to Liability in Event of Execution—Points of Law Upon the Subject. The question of the liability of the life insurance companies for the payment of the policies issued upon the life of J. Samuel McCue, ex-Mayor of Charlottesville, who is now under sentence of death for the murder of his wife, is one of great consequence and of considerable interest to all. Diligent search of all authorities on life insurance and of all adjudicated cases fail to reveal a case of a similar nature in Virginia or in any other State. In all of the works of authority on life insurance it is laid down as certain that no policy can be enforced where the insured was put to death by due process of law, and this conclusion is based upon very sound reasoning. May on Insurance, Sec. 326, p. 696. Death by the hands of justice.— "Usually associated with the exception of liability by suicide is that of `death by the hands of justice.' This is defined by Tindal, C. J., as dying in consequence of a felony previously committed.' It is death under and by virtue of a judicial sentence for some crime, and not merely a rightful killing. An exception of liability in case of `death by the hands of justice' has been held to be unnecessary, as it is against public policy to insure against the consequences of a capital felony; and such risk could not be covered by the policy even if expressly agreed upon. As the law will not permit an express stipulation that a man shall derive pecuniary benefit upon his dying by the hands of public justice, as against public policy, it will not imply any such stipulation. Death, therefore, at the hands of public justice works a forfeiture of all right to indemnity under a policy, whether it does or does not contain such stipulation." In Vance on Insurance, p. 524, one of the latest authorities upon the subject, is found much the same doctrine as in May on Insurance. As stated before, there can be found no case exactly similar to the McCue case as to particulars, both as to the murder and as to the issuance of the policies, their beneficiaries, &amp;c., but the great principle involved, as to whether or not these policies are enforceable, remains in the McCue case the same, as in the adjudicated cases to be given below, which are the only ones bearing at all directly upon the question involved. In 1830 a case was decided in the House of Lords in England, (reported in 4 Bligh N. S., 194, 211) in which a man was convicted and hanged for forgery. Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, "It appears to me that this resolves itself into a very plain and simple consideration. Suppose that in the policy itself this risk has been insured against; that is, that the party insuring had agreed to pay a sum of money year by year, upon condition, that in the event of his committing a capital felony, and being tried, convicted and executed for that felony, his assignees shall receive a certain sum of money—is it impossible that such a contract could be sustained? Is it not void upon the plainest principle of public policy? Would not such a contract (if available) take away one of those restraints operating on the minds of men against the commission of crimes—namely, the interest we have in the welfare and prosperity of our connexions? Now, if a policy of that description with such a form of conditions inserted in it in express terms, cannot on grounds of public policy, be sustained, how is it to be contended that in a policy expressed in such terms as the present, and after the events which have happened, that we can sustain such a claim? Can we, in considering this policy, give to it the effect of that insertion, which if expressed in terms would have rendered the policy, as far as that condition went, at least, altogether void." The only case which can be found in any of the American reports which bears anywise directly upon the one which is now before the public mind, is the one reported in a recent report of the United States Supreme Court. It is the case of Burt v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., reported in 187 U. S. 362, 23 Sup. Ct. 139. This was an action to recover on a policy of life insurance, and was commenced in the District Court of Travis County, Texas, and removed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Texas. The policy was issued August 1st, 1894, and Wm. E. Burt was the insured. The policy, in case of death, was payable to Anna M. Burt, wife of the insured, if living, otherwise to his executors, administrators or assigns. On September 10, 1895, the beneficiary Anna M. Burt, and her husband, assigned one-half interest to the plaintiffs to secure them as creditors of the assignors. On July 24, 1896, the beneficiary, Anna M. Burt, died intestate, as did also the only children of the beneficiary and the insured. On February 4, 1897, the insured, Wm. E. Burt, conveyed to the plaintiffs the remaining interest in the policy, making them the sole owners of it. They are also his sole heirs, and as such are entitled to the full benefits of the policy, there being no administrator on his estate and no necessity for one. On November 7, 1896, the insured, having been indicted for the murder of his wife, the beneficiary, was tried and convicted in the District Court of Travis County, Texas, was sentenced to be put to death, and on May 27, 1898, was hanged pursuant to such sentence. The petition in this case alleged that, notwithstanding such conviction, sentence and execution, the insured, Wm. E. Burt, did not in fact commit the crime of murder, nor participate therein, but that if he did the policy was not avoided thereby, because he was at the time insane. Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court, which is in part as follows: "There is nothing in the policy which in terms covers the contingency here presented, the extracts therefrom given in the preceding statement being all that even remotely, by suggestion or inference can have any bearing." The question therefore is whether an ordinary life policy, containing no applicable special provisions, is a binding contract to insure again legal execution for crime. The petitioners, would distinguish between cases in which the insured is justly convicted and executed and those in which he is unjustly convicted. The allegation here is that, notwithstanding his conviction and execution, he was not in fact guilty, that he did not participate in the killing of his wife and that if he did he was insane at the time and therefore not responsible for his actions. Accepting the division made by counsel as one facilitating a just conclusion concerning the rights of the parties hereto, it is asked: First—whether a policy of life insurance is a contract, binding the insurer to pay to the beneficiary the amount of the policy in case the insured is legally and justly executed for crime. In other words, do insurance companies insure against crime? Is that a risk which enters into and becomes a part of the contract? Mr. Justice Brewer here refers to the English case quoted above quite fully, and he incorporates part of that opinion in his own. He then says, "Public policy forbids the insertion in a contract of a condition which would tend to induce crime, and as it forbids the introduction of such a stipulation it also forbids the enforcement of a contract under circumstances which cannot be lawfully stipulated for." He refers again to Supreme Commandery &amp;c. v. Ainsworth, 71 Ala., 436-446, in which the court says, "Death, the risk of life insurance, the event upon which the insurance money is payable, is certain of occurence; the uncertainty of the time of its occurrence is the material element and consideration of the contract. It cannot be in contemplation of the parties, that the assured, by his own criminal act, shall deprive the contract of its material element; shall vary and enlarge the risk, and hasten the day of payment of the insurance money. The fair and just interpretation of a contract of life insurance, made with the assured, is that the risk of death proceeding from other causes than the voluntary act of the assured, producing or intended to produce." It seems immaterial to the question involved whether or not the policies are assigned to any one other than the original beneficiary, or whether they are payable to the insured's estate. Assignment of the policies as in the case of Burt vs. Union Central Ins. Co. cannot, it seems, alter the principle laid down in these two decisions. That principle is that it is contrary to public policy to pay the life insurance of a man who is executed by due process of law. The fact of any benefit accruing to the insured by an assignment of his policies seems never to have been dwelt upon by the courts in either of the decisions mentioned; and the fact that McCue had made no assignment of his policies and could not have secured any pecuniary benefit therefrom, seems to fail to alter the sound conclusion based upon these decisions that the courts will not enforce the payment of these policies upon the life of the accused. What the companies will do in another matter. The settlement of the policies seems to be entirely with them. It looks as if the companies will certainly have to pay the "cash surrender value" of the policies up to the time of execution. Another view seems to be that the companies may return the premiums paid in, together with six per cent. interest. Whatever the legal status of the question may be, it is remarkable then, that of all legal executions in America, none have carried life insurance but Burt, in the case referred to, and if any have carried insurance then what have the companies done?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. PERSONAL SKETCHES. Those Who Figured in the Trial—The Lawyers and Court Officers— Condensed Biographies of the Most Prominent Persons Connected with the Case. Judge George Watts Morris was born in the city of New York on December 13, 1857, his early education was obtained at the well known school of this city conducted by the late Major Horace W. Jones, who was assisted at that time by William R. Abbott. Judge Morris entered the University of Virginia in the fall of 1874 and for three years was an academic student, concluding each course with honor. The succeeding two years he was a student in the law school under the famous John B. Minor, and in 1879 he took the degree of Bachelor of Law from the University. In the same year Judge Morris began the practice of law in Charlottesville, Va., and immediately met with success. He was for a number of years interested in politics, being chairman of both the city and county democratic committees. In the fall of 1893 Judge Morris was elected to the State Senate and re-elected in 1897. In both cases he was elected unanimously and by all political parties. He was elected by the General Assembly of Virginia Judge of the Corporation Court of Charlottesville and qualified for the office in March, 1901. Since that time he has served as judge with a dignity and fairness which has made him esteemed by the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle county. A number of the best citizens and lawyers of the State have united in commendation of Judge Morris for the maner in which he conducted the McCue case. His fairness, impartiality and strict regard for the law won him a foremost place in the legal fraternity of Virginia, and among its judiciary. * * * CAPT. MICAJAH WOODS: Capt. Micajah Woods, who is one of the best known members of the legal profession in the State of Virginia, is a native of this State, having been born in Albemarle county, at "Holkham," the 17th of May, 1844. His father, Dr. John Rhodes Woods, was for many years considered the leading authority upon stock raising in Virginia, and his mother was Miss Sabina Lewis Stuart Creigh. On both sides of his family he is descended from Scotch-Irish ancestry. His early education was obtained at the Lewisburg Academy, the Military School of Charlottesville, taught by Col. John Bowie Strange, and at the Bloomfield Academy, taught by Messrs Brown and Tebbs. In 1861 he entered the University of Virginia, and like many of the other young men of the South, was soon a member of the Confederate army. He first served when barely 17 years of age as volunteer aide on the staff of General John B. Floyd, in the West Virginia campaign of 1861, and then in 1862 as a private in the Albemarle Light Horse Company, in the Second Regiment, Virginia Cavalry, and afterwards was first lieutenant in the Virginia State line. At the close of the war he returned to the University, where he studied in the academic department for one year and then studied law, being graduated in 1868 with the degree of Bachelor of Law. He immediately opened an office for the practice of his profession in Charlottesville, and in 1870 was elected Commonwealth Attorney for that county, which position he has filled for thirty-four years, without having had opposition for the nomination since 1873; and at the November, 1903, election he was chosen to the said office for another term of four years, commencing January 1st, 1904. In 1872 Captain Woods was made a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, a position which he held for four years, having been at the time of his appointment, the youngest member of that Board ever selected. In politics he is a Democrat. He has been chairman of the Democratic party of Albemarle county for several years, and as elector represented the Seventh Congressional District of Virginia; and also was a member of the Presidential Electoral Board in 1888, which cast the vote of Virginia for Cleveland for president. Captain Woods is known all over Virginia as the peer of any lawyer in the State. * * * DANIEL HARMON: Daniel Harmon of counsel for defense was born in 1859 at Alexandria, Va., and was brought by his parents, Mr. Daniel Harmon and Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Harmon, nee Wood, to this city about a year later. He attended the school then conducted in this city by Major Horace Jones and Armistead Gordon, now of Staunton. He then went to the University of Virginia and entered the law school, graduating in 1882. Mr. Harmon went west, and not until 1884 did he begin the practice of his profession. Since that time he has been an honor to the bar of Charlottesville and Albemarle. Three times Mr. Harmon has been appointed a member of the Board of Visitors of the University—once each by Governor O'Ferrall, Governor Tyler and Governor Montague. He is a man of splendid mental ability, strong in debate, quick at repartee, and of undoubted strength of character. He is, in short, a man whom all love and respect. Mr. Harmon has been connected with many important cases since entering the legal profession, the most famous of which was that about a year ago when Mrs. Nannie Langhorne-Shaw of Albemarle, sued and obtained a divorce from her husband, Robert Shaw of Boston. * * * FRANK GILMER: Frank Gilmer, Commonwealth's Attorney of Charlottesville, was born January 29, 1857, at Buckeyeland, Albemarle county. He is a great-grandson of Dr. George Gilmer of Penn Park, who was family physician of Thomas Jefferson. Mr. Gilmer has a medical account book showing the account of Thomas Jefferson with his family physician. Dr. Gilmer's eldest daughter married William Wirt, Attorney General of the United States. One of his sons, a great uncle of Mr. Frank Gilmer, Mr. Francis Walker Gilmer, was the first law professor at the University of Virginia, and was sent abroad by Mr. Jefferson to select the first corps of professors at the University. He died soon after taking the University law chair. Governor Thomas Walker Gilmer of Virginia was an uncle of the chief prosecuting attorney. The latter's parents were George C. and Mildred Wirt Gilmer, the mother, nee Duke, being a sister of the late Col. R. T. W. Duke, who was for a number of years attorney for the Albemarle commonwealth. Mr. Gilmer was educated in private schools at his birthplace, at Major Jones' School, this city, and at Richmond College. From 1871 to 1872 he was at Hampden-Sidney. He studied law at the University of Virginia one session after leaving Hampden-Sidney and took the summer course for one term. During this time he was clerk in the University postoffice to obtain funds to pay his way through college. In 1881 Mr. Gilmer began the practice of law. He has been Commonwealth's Attorney of Charlottesville since 1888 and his present term does not expire until January 1st, 1906. Never since Mr. Gilmer has been Commonwealth's Attorney has a case he conducted and prepared in the Corporation Court, upon which an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Appeals, in which the judgment was in favor of the Commonwealth that has not been affirmed. This includes the celebrated Muscoe case. No case in which the Commonwealth was the appellant has been reversed. Mr. Gilmer married March 17, 1886, Miss Rebecca Singleton Haskel, of Columbia, S. C. He is the father of two boys. * * * JOHN L. LEE: John L. Lee, chief counsel for J. Samuel McCue since the withdrawal of Daniel Harmon on account of illness, was born in 1861 in New Orleans, La. His early education was secured at Sewanee when he was ten years old. When thirteen he went to Germany and spent three years abroad. When Mr. Lee returned to this country he went to Amherst county. After studying at the Kennon High School at Amherst, he studied law in a private office. He began the practice of law in Amherst when only twenty-two years old. Then at the tender age of twenty-three he became Commonwealth's Attorney of Amherst county and held the office eight years, resigning before the expiration of his second term to practice law in Lynchburg. He formed a partnership nine years ago with Mr. Howard, the firm's style being Lee and Howard. It has enjoyed an unusually lucrative practice. Twenty years ago Mr. Lee married Miss Mary Walker of Amherst county. He has one son and one daughter. Among the number of important cases with which Mr. Lee has been connected was the contest of Mrs. Ann Fletcher Williams' will involving a half million of dollars. Another was the recent George M. Jones will case in Lynchburg, involving $200,000. Mr. Lee succeeded with his associate, Mr. J. Tinsley Coleman, also associated with the subject of this sketch in the McCue case, in getting $50,000 for a public library for the city of Lynchburg and the payment of counsel's fees and costs. Mr. Lee was counsel for Aylett Ashby, charged with the murder of Mr. Mayre in Newport News and won his case. He is, at this writing, counsel for Charles S. Forbes of Buckingham county, charged with the burning of his father's house, and secured the continuance of the latter case so he might defend J. Samuel McCue. * * * G. BURNLEY SINCLAIR: G. Burnley Sinclair, associate counsel for the defense, was born at Meadow Creek, Albemarle county, in April, 1870. His parent moved to Charlottesville in 1875. Mr. Sinclair received his early education at the Charlottesville High School Academy of this city. After graduating in 1889, he studied at the University of Virginia one year and then decided to enter upon a business career and went to Princeton, W. Va. He became in turn stenographer, court reporter and bank cashier. In 1899 Mr. Sinclair determined to study law and entered the Southwestern University in Tennessee and completed the course, taking the Bachelor of Law degree. He then returned to Charlottesville and took the summer law course at the University under Professors Lile and Graves, and began the practice of his profession in partnership with Mr. George Walker, whose sketch and photograph have previously appeared in The Progress. While living in Princeton Mr. Sinclair married Miss Nita McNutt, daughter of Dr. Robert B. McNutt. They have no children. Mr. Sinclair is an officer of the local B. P. O. Elks and a director in several corporations in which he is interested. Since he began the practice of law in this city his progress in his chosen life work has been rapid. He is eagerly sought, especially as a criminal lawyer. He has been connected with several important cases and has never failed to display legal ability and oratorical powers. His address to a jury is always convincing, his earnestness supplementing his other powers. He is one of the most popular men of the town and of prepossessing appearance and manners. * * * CAPT. RICHARD S. KER: Capt. Richard S. Ker of Staunton, Commonwealth's Attorney of Augusta county and associate counsel for the prosecution, was born in Staunton in 1866. His early education was obtained at the Staunton Public Schools and at the Staunton Military Academy. Afterward Mr. Ker entered Washington &amp; Lee University, and after completing his academic course at that institution, taught school in Botetourt county, Va., and at Humboldt, Tenn. He was a law student of the University of Virginia for two sessions, completing his course in 1888. He has been in active practice in Staunton since his graduation. Captain Ker is serving his second term as prosecuting attorney of Augusta county. He was elected in 1898 and re-elected in 1903. Captain Ker has been a member of the law firm of Ker and Ker since January, 1897. In May, 1889, Captain Ker married Miss Jessie S. McNeill of Staunton. He is the father of three boys. Of all the famous attorneys connected with the McCue case, Captain Ker is one of the very best. He has a fine reputation in Staunton, Augusta county and the State. One of the most noted cases in Virginia—that against Kennedy for train wrecking—was conducted by him for the Commonwealth, and the accused was convicted. He is a man of very fine address, handsome and of prepossessing appearance, unusually genial in manner and a thorough gentleman. He is an orator of no mean ability, very quiet but shrewd and has a convincing manner in his presentation of a case to the jury. * * * GEORGE E. WALKER: George Edward Walker, one of the attorneys for the defense, whose likeness is given above, is thirty years old. He was born in Charlottesville on October 20, 1874. His parents are Mr. J. Frost Walker and Mrs. Nannie V. Walker, both of whom are now living at Columbia, S. C. Mr. Walker was raised in Columbia and attended the schools of that city. He came to Charlottesville in 1889 to attend Major Horace Jones' School. After three sessions at that fine institution, he entered the University of Virginia Academic department in the fall of 1892 and continued his course for two years. He then took a year's course in the University Law School. After leaving the University Mr. Walker studied law in Mr. John B. Moons' office until 1897 when he began practice. In 1901 he entered partnership with Mr. G. Burnley Sinclair, and has, with his partner, enjoyed a very lucrative practice. He was a member of the City Council which went out of office last September and did good and faithful work for the people of the First Ward, declining renomination. He is chairman of the City Democratic Committee. In November, 1897 Mr. Walker married Miss Annie Watson of this city. He had one child—George E. Walker, Jr. Mr. Walker is a member of several secret societies, notably the Elks, of which he is treasurer. He is a man of great popularity, of excellent talents and a decided credit to the Albemarle and Charlottesville bar. * * * EDWARD O. M'CUE: Edward O. McCue, brother of the accused and associate counsel for the defense, was born in Albemarle county in 1876. His early education was received from his uncle, John W. McCue, of Greenwood. Later he attended the public schools, the University High School, conducted by Boaz and Levett; and the Greenwood Academy for four sessions. Mr. McCue entered the University of Virginia and for two and one-half years he studied law. He obtained his license in 1897 and began practice in the spring of 1898 in this city. He was elected justice of Charlottesville in 1902 and re-elected in 1904. It is no exaggeration to say that there has never been a better administrator of justice in any petty court than Justice McCue. Even the people whom he convicts love him for his moderation and just findings. During the trial of J. S. McCue for wife-murder, his brother was untiring in his fidelity, brotherly love and earnest effort on the accused's behalf. No man could have done more than Edward O. McCue has done and the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle honor and respect him for his loyalty to his blood relative. * * * J. TINSLEY COLEMAN: J. Tinsley Coleman, counsel for defense, was born in Nelson county about 45 years ago. He was educated at Norwood High School, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the University of Virginia. After leaving the University he began the practice of law at Nelson and soon afterwards formed a partnership with G. E. Caskie. About ten years ago the firm of Caskie &amp; Coleman moved to Lynchburg. The subject of this sketch has been engaged in one side or the other of most of the more important cases in and around Lynchburg since moving there. Among them the Bedford City Bank cases; the cases growing out of the failure of the Traders' Bank in Lynchburg; the cases in which the estate of Indiana Fletcher Williams and Sweetbriar Institute were involved; and the Jones will case. He has also appeared more than once before the Inter-State Commerce Commission. Mr. Coleman's professional career, and that of J. L. Lee, one of his associates in the McCue case, have progressed along lines singularly parallel. They both moved to Lynchburg from nearby county seats at the same time and in all the cases mentioned and many others have been associated together. C. W. ROGERS: City Sergeant, C. W. Rogers, who gained the nickname of "Foxy" during his efforts to secure a venire of sixteen men from four cities of the State, was born in Halifax county on July 17, 1852. He moved with his parents to North Carolina in 1866 and returned to Virginia (Albemarle county) in 1873. Mr. Rogers came to Charlottesville in 1888 as deputy county treasurer and remained in that position until the death of the treasurer, Captain A. J. Farish, in January, 1892. He was also in the treasurer's office with J. R. Wingfield, who succeeded Captain Farish. He was the first auditor elected in the city of Charlottesville. Mr. Rogers was elected to his present office in 1894, and has been elected to that office at each succeeding election. The popularity of the genial sergeant is partly shown by the fact that he is a Past Master of No. 60, A. F. &amp; A. M., Past High Priest of Keystone Royal Arch Chapter, No. 58, and Past Eminent Commander of the Charlottesville Commandery No. 3, Knights Templars. He is also a member of Mystic Shrine, Acca Temple, Richmond, and a member of B. P. O. Elks, No. 389, Charlottesville. There is no man who made a better impression on outside citizens during the noted McCue case than Mr. Rogers. His method of summoning venire-men gained him friends even from those who desired to be excused. His courtesy to newspaper men, to two of whom he surrendered his desk in the courtroom, endeared him to them. His hospitality to the attorneys on both sides and to the court stenographers was unexcelled, and his faithful performance of duty gained him a warmer place in the hearts of Charlottesville voters. * * * The other officers of the court were R. W. Duke, clerk; W. L. Maupin, deputy clerk; Nathaniel Martin, jailor; O. M. Wood, L. W. Noel, B. E. Jeffries and A. H. Dudley, deputy sergeants. The following newspaper men reported the trial: H. J. Mock, of the Associated Press; R. D. Stewart, of Baltimore Sun; B. L. Hawkins, of Washington Post; Evan R. Chesterman, of Richmond News Leader; Joseph F. Geisinger, of Richmond Times-Dispatch; J. H. Lindsay and W. C. Scott, Jr., of the Charlottesville Progress. Both the Western Union and the Postal Telegraph Companies kept bicycle runners at the courthouse throughout the trial to handle the mass of telegraphic matter sent off to the various newspapers of the country. Messrs. George L. Hart and J. H. Morris, well known court stenographers of Roanoke, Va., took down each day's evidence, furnishing to the counsel on both sides a complete typewritten copy of the same on the following morning. E. O.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. FAMOUS MURDER TRIALS IN VIRGINIA. Cases of Conviction Upon Circumstantial Evidence—The Trials of Charles Young, Dandridge Eppes, Jeter Phillips and Thomas J. Cluverius. The most notable case of conviction upon circumstantial evidence that ever occurred in the United States was that of Webster who killed Parkman in the city of Boston, about the year 1850. There have occurred four notable cases of like character in Virginia within the last sixty years. They are, in the order of their occurrence, the case of Charles Young, of Caroline County, about the year 1840; the case of Dandridge Eppes, of Nottoway County, about the year 1845; the case of Jeter Phillips, of Caroline County, about the year 1867; and the Cluverius case, in Richmond, in the year 1885. The Webster-Parkman case aroused a deep and almost thrilling interest from one end of the land to the other. Webster was a professor in a medical college in Boston. Parkman had lent him some seven or eight hundred dollars, and was beginning to be importunate for the repayment of the money. Webster wrote a note to Parkman asking him to come to his office in the medical college. Parkman was seen to go there, and was never seen afterwards. Among the ashes taken from the stove in Webster's labratory was a set of false teeth which were identified by a Boston dentist as a set which he had made for Parkman. This was the principal incriminating circumstance which led to the conviction and execution of Webster. Before his execution Webster made a confession, claiming that he did not premeditatedly kill Parkman, but that being angered in a quarrel with the latter, he seized a poker and dealt him a blow on his forehead from which he fell dead; and that fearing the suspicion that might arise against him, he cut the body up and cremated it. The first in order of time of the four Virginia cases mentioned above was that of Charles Young, of Caroline, who somewhere about the year 1840 was convicted and hung for the killing of one Thornton, sheriff, or deputy-sheriff, of Caroline County, of a highly respectable family. On the afternoon of a dismal, rainy day, a Saturday in November, the body of Thornton was found in the road, from the effects of a wound by buck-shot. A piece of cotton cloth, about two inches square, was found near the body which from its signed and blackened appearance had apparently been used as gun wadding. This piece of cotton cloth fitted in exactly to a torn, or cut, corner of a cotton sheet in Young's house. The shot extracted from Thorton's body corresponded with shot found in Young's house. On these two circumstances namely, Young was found guilty and hung. Distinguished counsel took part, on the one side or the other, in this case. Among them was Mr. Stevenson of Fredericksburg, brother of the Hon. Andrew Stevenson of Albemarle; and John L. Marye the leading lawyer at that time in Tidewater Virginia. Some ten years after the execution of Young a verbal report came from some Western State that a man who had gone out West from the neighborhood in Caroline county, where this tragedy occurred, on his death bed, confessed that he shot Thornton, and that he had possessed himself of the piece of cotton, torn from a sheet in Young's house, in order to fasten suspicion on the latter. While some believed this story it did not receive very general credence. Young denied to the last that he was the guilty party. The next in chronological order of the cases of conviction upon circumstantial evidence comes that of Dandridge Eppes, of Nottoway County, who about the year 1845 killed Adolphus Muir. The circumstances of this case might well afford the material for a most romantic and sensational publication, surpassing in actual and thrilling incidents the imaginary creations of the modern sensational novel. Eppes had borrowed a few hundred dollars from Muir, and Muir was asking for the return of the money. Eppes and Muir lived but a few miles apart, and were, apparently, fast friends. On a wintry evening in the early part of December Muir went to Eppes' house to ask for his money. Eppes received him cordially. Snow was on the ground. Eppes remarked that deer had been seen in the neighborhood, and proposed that they should go out and kill one. To this Muir assented, and they started out, each with a loaded gun. Muir was in advance, and as he was climbing a fence, Eppes discharged his gun against him, and laid him prostrate. Eppes left him in a dying condition, and next morning when Eppes, who may be presumed to have passed a sleepless night, went to the scene, it was found that Muir had crawled fifty or sixty yards before he expired. Suspicion gradually pointed to Eppes, and parties from the neighborhood visited the farm. But Eppes was so cordial in his reception as to disarm suspicion. Presently a statement appeared in a Petersburg paper to the effect that a watch which had been pawned or sold by Eppes to a Petersburg firm had been identified, by the numbers preserved by the original watch-maker who sold it, as the watch which had been sold to Muir. Immediately upon seeing this statement in the Petersburg paper Eppes mounted a thoroughbred horse and rode seventy miles in one day to Lynchburg where he exchanged, or sold, this wearied horse for a fresh one, and started for the far West. The next note of his adventures was at New Orleans. There he caused a straw hat, marked Dandridge Eppes, to be thrown in the Mississippi River, and to be picked up. Upon this, a notice was sent to the Virginia papers that one Dandridge Eppes had been drowned in the Mississippi, and that his hat had been picked up. A year afterwards, a Virginian who had gone to Texas from Nottoway County recognized Eppes in a Texas town. A requisition from the Governor of Virginia was sent out for his apprehension and return to Virginia, and he was arrested while playing on the fiddle for the participants in a rapturous dance. He was a fine violinist. He was brought back to Virginia, tried and hung. The main testimony against him was the dumb evidence of a negro man. In an improvident hour, Eppes had given himself into the power of a negro slave. He employed this trusted slave to assist in carrying the dead body of Muir to a sequestered spot in the woods, and there burying it in a shallow grave, and covering the remains with leaves. The negro, being a slave, could not under the then existing laws, testify in the case. But there were witnesses who testified that the negro took the body to the spot where Muir was buried. Muir, who was a prepossessing young man of good family, was soon to be married to a charming young lady of Cumberland county, belonging to one of the influential families whose residences were on Willis' river. There was a story current at the time that Muir was engaged to a daughter of Eppes'; but such was not the case. The next in sequence, and in importance, in the way of convictions and executions upon circumstantial evidence are the Jeter Phillips and the Cluverius cases. These being of comparatively recent occurrence, and surviving in the memory of many readers of this pamphlet, do not need to be elaborated, as in the Charles Young and the Dandridge Eppes cases. The Jeter Phillips case was a startling one in the quiet homes of Virginia. The corpse of a murdered woman was on the last day of February, 1867, found on the farm of a Mr. Drinker, in Henrico County. James Jeter Phillips, a Confederate soldier, was arrested on June 13, 1867. The preliminary examination began June 1st, and the court sent the prisoner on for trial to the next term of the Circuit Court of Henrico. Then began the arduous labor of selecting a jury. Three days were thus spent. "On the nineteenth day," says the Phillips pamphlet, "the jury were discharged, they having found it utterly impossible to agree upon a verdict." The second trial of Phillips began June 15, 1868. "It was found impossible to procure a jury from the county of Henrico, and the sheriff, by order of the court, summoned twenty-five talesman each from Alexandria and Charlottesville." From these, on June 3, the jury was selected. The case went to the jury on the seventeenth day of the trial, and on July 10, 1868—a Friday—Phillips was sentenced to die. The point made by some one in the McCue trial, that there was possible error in allowing the jury to divide up, each division in charge of a deputy, was made in the Phillips case, but was ignored by the Court of Appeals. Judge Alexander Rives, of Albemarle County, delivered the opinion. On March 14, 1885, about 7 o'clock in the morning, Superintendent Rose of the Old Reservoir, Richmond, Va., found emersed in the water a body which proved to be that of Fannie Lilian Madison. She had left Bath County, where she was employed as a teacher, on March 12, to visit Richmond, where she registered at the American Hotel about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 13th under the assumed name of "Miss F. L. Merton." At breakfast she received a letter which she answered at once by writing "I will be there as soon as possible, so do wait for me," and the letter she addressed to "T. J. Cluverius." Afterwards she was seen with Cluverius, and the following morning she was found dead, as related. About the reservoir were evidences of a scuffle, and a watch key of peculiar pattern was found. This key was the circumstance upon which the case hinged. The accused denied that it was his property, while others swore that on March 13 he wore a key much like it and that the following day it was missing from his watch chain. The key and the fact that Cluverius was shown to have a motive for getting rid of the girl—she was enceinte—encompassed his conviction, and in due time he suffered on the scaffold.</field>
