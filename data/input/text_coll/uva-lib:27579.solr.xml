      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF PRINTING IN AMERICA. HISTORY OF NEWSPAPERS, FROM THE PERIOD WHEN THEY WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH COLONIES, TO THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THOSE PUBLISHED IN EUROPE. To an observer of the great utility of the kind of publications called newspapers, it may appear strange that they should have arisen to the present almost incredible number, from a comparatively late beginning. I would not be understood to intimate that ancient nations had no institutions which answered the purposes of our public journals, because I believe the contrary is the fact. The Chinese gazettes may have been published from a very remote period of time. The kings of Persia had their scribes who copied the public despatches, which were carried into the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the Persian empire "by posts;" and, it is probable, they transmitted accounts of remarkable occurrences in the same manner. The Romans also adopted the custom of sending into their distant provinces written accounts of victories gained, and other remarkable events, which took place in that empire.1 1 Newspapers were foreshadowed among the ancients by the Acta Diurna of the Romans—daily official reports of public occurrences.—H. It has already been mentioned,2 2 Vol. i. p. 19. that the Mexicans were very expert at engraving and painting. It has been represented as probable that they likewise executed hieroglyphical gazettes; for when the Spaniards first arrived on the Mexican coast, some of the subjects of Montezuma II sent to him such a description of the Spanish ships, men, etc., as not only terrified him with the strangeness of the sight, but also astonished the Spaniards themselves, by the accuracy of it, when the paintings were afterward shown to them. These kinds of hieroglyphical gazettes were not unknown, it is said, among the natives of the more northern parts of America. Annexed is an engraving of a copy of an Indian gazette, taken many years since by a French officer from the American original, with an explanation of the same. It relates to an expedition of a body of Canadian warriors, who, soon after the settlement of this part of America, took up the hatchet in favor of the French against a hostile tribe that adhered to the English. It was communicated to me many years ago, and, soon after, I had it engraved for the Royal American Magazine. It had previously appeared in several works published in Europe. In the year 1531, a newspaper was printed at Venice, for which the price charged was a Venetian coin called gazetta; and hence is derived our word gazette; the name of the coin having been transferred to the paper.1 1 I will here take leave to remark, that the statement of facts respecting the origin of newspapers, as published in the introduction to the History of Newspapers in the first edition of this work, was taken from writers whose authority I considered unquestionable. Among the works I consulted was the British Encyclopedia; but farther researches convince me that the encyclopedists made some erroneous statements on this subject. These errors I discovered, and corrected at the close of the volume which contained them, before it came from the press. In this edition the corrections are made in their proper place. The first newspaper produced by the English press, was entitled The English Mercurie, printed and published on the 28th day of July, 1588, in London, by Christopher Barker, who was printer to Queen Elizabeth. A copy of this paper is preserved in the British Museum.1 1 Mr Thomas Watt, the distinguished bibliographer, ascertained that the copies of this alleged newspaper, in the British Museum, were forgeries, executed about the year 1766.—Letter to Antonio Panizzi.—H. Another paper was printed in London, anno 1622, the title of which was The Weekly Courant. In 1639, a paper was printed at Newcastle upon Tyne, by Robert Baker. The Mercuries succeeded, being first published August 22, 1642, and continued occasionally through the protectorate of Cromwell, and after his death. One was entitled The Mercurius Rusticus, or "the Countrie's Complaint of the Barbarous Outrage began in the year 1642, by the Sectaries of this once Flourishing Kingdome;" edited by Bruno Ryves. These papers were generally in quarto, and sometimes contained two sheets; but neither of them obtained a permanent establishment. The oldest English newspaper I have seen, is one now in my possession, which was published weekly on Thursdays, anno 1660. The title of it is Mercurius Publicus, "Comprising the Sum of Forraign Intelligence: With the afiairs now in agitation in England, Scotland, and Ireland, For Information of the People. Published by Order." This publication was begun that year; it contained two small quarto sheets. A number of books and medicines for sale, by various people, are advertised in that paper, which was printed in London "by J. Macock and Tho. Newcomb." I cannot determine if any other periodical work was published in England at that time; but Sir Roger L'Estrange published a paper called The Public Intelligencer, in 1663.2 2 After all that has been written about early newspapers, it is not usual to find perfect accuracy in any one account. The paper which our author refers to as the The Weekly Courant, anno 1622, was The Courant or Weekly Newes from Foreign Parts, established by Nathaniel Butter. Alexander Andrews, author of History of British Journalism, in a communication to Notes and Queries, 1st series, XI, 285, expresses the opinion that it appeared first in 1621. He says also that Butter published Sept. 9, 1622, a paper entitled News from most Parts of Christendom. It was probably the same paper as the first named, as may have been that entitled The Weekly News from Italy, Germanie, &amp;c. Butter is regarded as the father of the regular newspapers press. It is stated in Appleton's New American Cyclopedia, that the first attempt at parliamentary reporting was in 1641. But we have before us a fac simile of the 1st No. of ? Perfect Occurrences ? of ? Every Daies iournall ? In ? Parliament ? Of England. ? And other Moderate Intelligence ? From Tuesday Novemb. 3, to Friday Decemb. 4, 1640. ? Collected by Hon. Walkar Cleric.—H. See Appendix A. The British Encyclopedia, and other works, state, that "the first gazette in England was published at Oxford," the court being there on account of the prevalence of the plague in London. It was "in a folio half sheet, Nov. 7, 1665. On the removal of the court to London, the title was changed to The London Gazette." The publication of newspapers and pamphlets was prohibited by proclamation in England, anno 1680, but although this was done away during the revolution in that country, newspapers were afterwards made objects of taxation. In 1696, The Athenian Gazette was published in London, by John Dunton, whom I have had frequent occasion to mention. In that work Dunton states, that only nine newspapers, the Athenian Gazette included, were then published in England. Newspapers were not published in Scotland till after the accession of William and Mary to the throne of England. In the year 1808, the newspaper establishments in England amounted to one hundred and forty-five. Of this number forty-seven were published in London, viz: nine morning, and seven evening, daily papers; nine were printed three times, and one twice a week; and there were nineteen weekly, including eleven Sunday papers. Ninety-eight were printed in all other parts of England. The same year, nineteen were printed in Scotland, and thirty-five in Ireland, making the whole number published in the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, one hundred and ninety-seven. The celebrated Horace Walpole observes, that a Gazette was published in France, anno 1631, by Renaudot, a physician at Paris.1 1 It was called the Gazette de France.—H. This was prior to the appearance of the Journal des Savans. That kind of literary journals, called reviews and magazines, appears to have originated in France. The first production, of this description, was the Journal des Savans, which, according to D'Israeli, made its début on the 30th of May, 1665, and was contemporaneous with the London Gazette. It was published by Dennis de Sallo, an ecclesiastical counsellor in the parliament of Paris, in the name of the Sieur de Hedouville, his lacquey. Some suppose de Sallo adopted this method of sending it abroad in the world because he thought so humble an author as his servant would disarm criticism of its severity; or, that the scurrility of the critics would produce less effect than if directed against himself. The Journal des Savans comprehended a variety of subjects. It contained an account of all books published in Europe; panegyrics on deceased persons of celebrity; it announced all useful inventions, and such discoveries as were beneficial to the arts, or curious in science; chemical experiments, celestial and meteorological observations, discoveries in anatomy, and in the practice of physic; decisions of the ecclesiastical and secular tribunals; and the author intended to publish an account of the censures of the Sorbonne, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the course of a few years many imitations of this journal were published in different parts of Europe. Dr. Miller, of New York, in his valuable work entitled, A Brief Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century, mentions that "in 1671, appeared the Acta Medica Hafnensia, published by M. Bartholin. To which succeeded, in 1672, Mémoires des Arts et des Sciences, established in France, by M. Dennis; in 1682, the Acta Eruditorum, of Leipsic, by Menkenius; in 1684, Les Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres, by M. Bayle, and the Bibliotheque Universelle Choisie, et Ancienne et Moderne, by Le Clerc; in 1689, the Monathlichen Unterredungen, of Germany; in 1692, the Boekzaal van Europa, by P. Rabbus, in Holland; and in 1698, the Nova Literaria Maris Balthici; together with several others in Germany, France and Italy." These were all of that class of periodical works which are called reviews. The first publication of this kind in England, was The History of the Works of the Learned, printed in London, in 1699; which was soon followed by Memoirs of Literature, The Present State of the Republick of Letters, The Censura Temporum, and the Bibliotheca Curiosa. These were published in England the beginning of the eighteenth century, but they were soon discontinued.1 1 Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century, II, 235–6. The first English literary work, bearing the name of a magazine, was published in London in the year 1731, by Edward Cave,2 2 Edward Cave, the founder and editor of The Gentleman's Magazine, which has been "The fruitful mother of a thousand more," was the son of a shoemaker at Rugby, in Warwickshire, England; at which place he received his education in the free school. His apprenticeship he served with Collins, a printer and an alderman's deputy, in London. When he was of age, he wrote for Mist's Journal, and became the editor of a country newspaper. Through the interest of his wife, he obtained a small place in the postoffice; and some time after was promoted to the office of clerk of the franks. At length, he was enabled to purchase a small printing apparatus, with which he commenced the publication of a magazine; and, to this undertaking, he was indebted for the affluence which attended the last twenty years of his life, and the large fortune he left behind him. and is continued under the title of The Gentleman's Magazine at this time. It has acquired credit not only from its long establishment, but from its usefulness, and a considerable addition was made to its reputation by the labors of the learned doctor Samuel Johnson. The second performance of this description, was The London Magazine, a valuable publication, which was continued fifty years. The Scot's Magazine, is said to have been the third magazine published in Great Britain. The European Magazine was established in 1782. There are, at this time (1810), upwards of forty periodical works, denominated reviews and magazines, published in Great Britain and Ireland. Some of these reviews are regularly reprinted and republished in the United States. A list of the works of this description, which are published in the United States, will be found in the appendix. The British Encyclopedia, with large additions, in twenty volumes, quarto, was reprinted by Thomas Dobson, of Philadelphia. It was published in half volumes, two of which came from the press annually. The first public journals, printed in British America, made their appearance in 1704. In April of that year, the first Anglo American newspaper was printed at Boston, in Massachusetts Bay, by the postmaster, whose office was then regulated by the colonial government. At that period, I believe, there were only four or five postmasters in all the colonies. It was not until after the expiration of fifteen years, that another publication of the kind issued from any press in this part of the world. On the 21st day of December, 1719, the second Anglo-American newspaper was published in Boston; and, on the following day, December 22, the third paper appeared, which was printed in the city of Philadelphia. In 1725, a newspaper was first printed in New York; and after that time, gazettes were gradually introduced into the other colonies on the continent, and into the West Indies. There are now, 1810, more newspapers published in the United States, than in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.1 1 See further on, a calculation of the newspapers printed in the United States, and those published in Great Britain and Ireland. See also Appendix. In 1754,1 1 In 1748, five newspapers were printed in Boston, but one of them was discontinued in 1750; a provisional stamp act closed the publication of two more in 1755; but they were afterwards replaced by others. four newspapers only were printed in New England, these were all published in Boston, and, usually, on a small sheet; they were published weekly, and the average number of copies did not exceed six hundred from each press. No paper had then been issued in Connecticut, or New Hampshire. Some years before, one was printed for a short time in Rhode Island, but had been discontinued for want of encouragement. Vermont as a state did not exist, and the country which now composes it was then a wilderness. In 1775, a period of only twenty-one years, more copies of a newspaper were issued weekly from the village press at Worcester, Massachusetts, than were printed in all New England, in 1754; and one paper now published contains as much matter as did all the four published in Boston, in the year last mentioned. At the beginning of 1775, there were five newspapers published in Boston, one at Salem, and one at Newburyport, making seven in Massachusetts. There was, at that time, one published at Portsmouth; and no other in New Hampshire. One was printed at Newport, and one at Providence, making two in Rhode Island. At New London there was one, at New Haven one, one at Hartford and one in Norwich; in all four in Connecticut; and fourteen in New England. In the province of New York, four papers were then published; three in the city, and one in Albany.2 2 With all deference to Mr. Thomas's knowledge of what was done in his own time, it still seems hardly probable that the paper begun in Albany in 1771, could have been continued longer than 1773. No copies of it have been discovered here later than the early part of 1772.—M. In Pennsylvania there were, on the first of January, 1775, six; three in English and one in German, in Philadelphia, one in German, at Germantown; and one in English and German, at Lancaster. Before the end of January, 1775, three newspapers, in English, were added to the number from the presses in Philadelphia, making nine in Pennsylvania. In Maryland, two; one at Annapolis, and one at Baltimore. In Virginia, there were but two, and both of these at Williamsburg. One was printed at Wilmington, and one in Newbern, in North Carolina; three at Charleston, South Carolina; and one at Savannah, in Georgia. Making thirty-seven newspapers in all the British colonies, which are now comprised in the United States. To these may be added one at Halifax, in Nova Scotia; and one in Canada, at Quebec. In 1800,1 1 In 1796, a small paper, half a sheet medium, 4to, entitled The New World, was published at Philadelphia every morning and evening, Sunday excepted, by the ingenious Samuel H. Smith, afterwards the able editor of The National Intelligencer, published at Washington. The novelty of two papers a day, from the same press, soon ceased; it continued but a few months. This paper was printed from two forms, on the same sheet, each form having a title; one for the morning, and the other for the evening; the sheet was then divided, and one half of it given to the customers in the forenoon, and the other in the afternoon. there were at least one hundred and fifty publications of this kind printed in the United States of America, and since that time, the number has increased to three hundred and sixty.2 2 It may be remarked that this number of newspapers, which seemed to be worthy of notice at the time Mr. Thomas wrote, in 1810, is only about one-third as great as that which ceased to exist in the year 1872; so rapidly do newspapers now come forth, and soon after disappear from want of adequate support.—M. Those published before 1775 were weekly papers. Soon after the close of the Revolutionary war, daily papers were printed at Philadelphia, New York, &amp;c., and there are now, 1810, more than twenty published, daily, in the United States. It was common for printers of newspapers to subjoin to their titles "Containing the freshest Advices both Foreign and Domestic;" but gazettes and journals are now chiefly filled with political essays. News do not appear to be always the first object of editors, and, of course, "containing the freshest advices," &amp;c., is too often out of the question. For many years after the establishment of newspapers on this continent, very few advertisements appeared in them. This was the case with those that were early printed in Europe. In the first newspapers, advertisements were not separated by lines from the news, &amp;c., and were not even begun with a two line letter; when two line letters were introduced, it was some time before one advertisement was separated from another by a line, or rule as it is termed by printers. After it became usual to separate advertisements, some printers used lines of metal rules: others lines of flowers irregularly placed. I have seen in some New York papers, great primer flowers between advertisements. At length, it became customary to "set off advertisements," and from using types not larger than those with which the news were printed, types of the size of French canon have often been used for names, especially of those who advertised English goods. In the troublesome times, occasioned by the stamp act in 1765, some of the more opulent and cautious printers, when the act was to take place, put their papers in mourning, and, for a few weeks, omitted to publish them; others not so timid, but doubtful of the consequence of publishing newspapers without stamps, omitted the titles, or altered them, as an evasion; for instance the Pennsylvania Gazette, and some other papers, were headed "Remarkable Occurrences, &amp;c."—other printers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration in title or imprint. INDIAN GAZETTE. EXPLANATION OF THE INDIAN GAZETTE, GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THEIR EXPEDITIONS. The following divisions explain those on the plate referred to by the numbers. 1. Each of these figures represents the number ten. They all signify, that 18 times 10, or 180 American Indians took up the hatchet, or declared war, in favor of the French; which is represented by the hatchet placed over the arms of France. 2. They departed from Montreal —represented by the bird, just taking wing from the top of a mountain. The moon, and the buck, show the time to have been in the first quarter of the buckmoon, answering to July. 3. They went by water—signified by the canoe. The number of huts, such as they raise to pass the night in, shows they were 21 days on their passage. 4. Then they came on shore, and traveled seven days by land—represented by the foot, and the seven huts. 5. When they arrived near the habitations of their enemies, at sunrise —shewn by the sun being to the eastward of them, beginning, as they think, its daily course; there they lay in wait three days—represented by the hand pointing and the three huts. 6. After which, they surprised their enemies, in number 12 times 10, or 120. The man asleep shows how they surprised them, and the hole in the top of the building is supposed to signify that they broke into some of their habitations in that manner. 7. They killed with the club eleven of their enemies, and took five prisoners—the former represented by the club, and the eleven heads; the latter by the figures on the little pedestals. 8. They lost nine of their own men in the action—represented by the nine heads within the bow, which is the emblem of honor among the Americans; but had none taken prisoners—a circumstance they lay great weight on, shown by all the pedestals being empty. 9. The heads of the arrows, pointing opposite ways, represent the battle. 10. The heads of the arrows, all pointing the same way, signify the flight of the enemy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MASSACHUSETTS. BOSTON. There was not a newspaper published in the English colonies, throughout the extensive continent of North America, until the 24th of April, 1704. John Campbell, a Scotchman, who was a bookseller and postmaster in Boston, was the first1 1 "The first attempt to set up a newspaper in North America, so far as can be ascertained, was made at Boston in 1690. Only one copy of this sheet is known to be in existence, that being in the state paper office in London." See an entire copy of this, by Samuel A. Green, M.D., in the Historical Magazine for August, 1857. The authorities objected to it. They called it a pamphlet. Felt's Annals of Salem (1849), vol. II, p. 14. If this can be claimed as a newspaper, may also the sheet printed by Samuel Green in 1689, the placard mentioned in the New Hamp. Hist. Soc. Coll., I, 252? This was issued at the time Dr. Increase Mather was in England, endeavoring to procure a new charter for the colony of Massachusetts. It was entitled The Present State of the New English Affairs, and was published to prevent false reports. Among the notes to a reprint of the first number of the Boston News Letter, we are informed that Campbell was accustomed to write news letters. Nine of these dated 1703, have been published by the Massachusetts Historical Society, in their Proceedings, 1867, p. 485.—M. who began and established a publication of this kind. It was entitled, N. E.    Numb. 1. The Boston News-Letter. Published by Authority.2 2 At the time this paper was first published, and for many years afterwards, there were licensers of the press. "Published by Authority," I presume means nothing more than this; what appeared in the publication was not disapproved by the licensers. From Monday April 17, to Monday April 24, 1704. It is printed on half a sheet of pot paper, with a small pica type, folio. The first page is filled with an extract from The London Flying Post, respecting the pretender, who styled himself James VIII of Scotland, sending popish missionaries from France into Scotland, &amp;c., by which the kingdoms of England and Scotland were endangered. The queen's speech to both houses of parliament on that occasion, a few articles under the Boston head, four short paragraphs of marine intelligence from New York, Philadelphia, and New London, and one advertisement, form its whole contents. The advertisement is from Campbell, the proprietor of the paper, and is as follows: "This News Letter is to be continued Weekly; and all Persons who have any Houses, Lands, Tenements, Farmes, Ships, Vessels, Goods, Wares or Merchandizes, &amp;c., to be Sold or Lett; or Servants Runaway; or Goods Stoll or Lost, may have the same Inserted at a Reasonable Rate; from Twelve Pence to Five Shillings, and not to exceed: Who may agree with Nicholas Boone for the same at his Shop next door to Major Davis's, Apothecary in Boston near the Old Meeting House. "All Persons in Town and Country may have said News-Letter Weekly upon reasonable tearms, agreeing with John Campbell Post Master for the same." The imprint is "Boston: Printed by B. Green. Sold by Nicholas Boone at his Shop near the Old Meeting-House." Green was Campbell's printer, and Boone was for some weeks his publisher. No. 2, is a whole sheet of pot, folio, three pages of which are printed, and one is blank. Campbell's advertisement is again inserted, and a single new one is added. In No. 4, Campbell desires those who wish to have advertisements inserted in the News-Letter, to apply to him. Boone's name is left out of the imprint of No. 5, and "Sold at the Post Office" is inserted. From No. 2, to No. 6, the News-Letter is contained on half of a pot sheet; and very few advertisements appear, some weeks not any. From No. 6 to No. 192, it is printed on a half sheet of foolscap. No. 192 contains only two short advertisements; and for years after it was but seldom supplied with more than two, and, often, with not one new advertisement in the week. In No. 71, Campbell inserted the following notice. "At the Desire of several Gentlemen, Merchants and others, who are willing to Contribute towards supporting this Publick Print of Intelligence, the Undertaker has begun where it was left off, in hopes of others following their good Example, whereby it may be carryed on at least another year: And therefore all Persons in Town and Country, who have a mind to encourage the same, may have said News Letters every week by the year upon reasonable Terms, agreeing with John Campbell Postmaster of Boston for the same." It does not appear that Campbell had discontinued the paper, and his real meaning where he says he "has begun where he left off," cannot now be well understood. No. 71, is dated August 24, 1705. It is evident from his advertisements in the course of this publication, that he "labored hard to get it along," that he had but very few subscribers, and that he did not receive much encouragement from advertising customers. Bartholomew Green printed the News-Letter for Campbell until November 3, 1707. No. 176, November 10, 1707, is "printed by John Allen, in Pudding Lane near the Post Office, and there to be Sold." In No. 190, Campbell informs "all who have a mind to encourage this Letter of Intelligence," to agree with him, "Post Master of New England, at Boston." In No. 210, four years after the first publication, Campbell inserted the following advertisement. "This being the last day of the fourth Quarter of this Letter of Intelligence: All persons in Town and Country, who have not already paid for this fourth Year are hereby desired now to pay or send it in; with their resolution if they would have it continued and proceeded on for a fifth year (Life permitted); which is only to be known by the number that take it weekly throughout the year; though there has not as yet a competent number appeared to take it annually so as to enable the Undertaker to carry it on effectually; yet he is still willing to proceed with it, if those Gentlemen that have this last year lent their helping hand to support it, continue still of the same mind another year, in hopes that those who have hitherto been backward to promote such a Publick Good will at last set in with it." No. 390, completed four years printing of the News-Letter by John Allen in Pudding lane. On the evening following the day on which No. 390 was published, namely, October 2, 1711, happened what, from that time until 1760, was called the great fire in Boston. The postoffice and Allen's printing house were consumed in that conflagration. The following week the News-Letter was again printed at Green's printing house in Newbury street, with this imprint, "Boston: Printed in Newbury Street, for John Campbell Post Master," which remained unaltered until October 1715. No. 391 contains an account of the fire. See Appendix B. In October, 1715, B. Green added his name to the imprint, as the printer. No. 664 begins the year 1717 with January—the News-Letter had previously begun the year with March. Although this paper had at that time been published thirteen years it still languished for the want of due support, as appears by an address from Campbell to the public. It was the design of Campbell that the News-Letter should give a selected, regular succession of foreign events; but the smallness of his paper rendered it impossible for him to publish occurrences seasonably; and at the close of the year he found himself greatly in arrears with his foreign intelligence. In Nos. 769 and 799, he proposes a remedy for this difficulty, which will, perhaps, be best understood in his own words, and may give a correct idea of the state of the News-Letter at that period. "After near upon Fourteen Years experience, The Undertaker knows that it's Impossible with half a Sheet in the Week to carry on all the Publick News of Europe, (tho' hitherto all those of Great Britian, Ireland, our own and our Neighbour Provinces has been Yearly Inserted). He now intends to make up that Deficiency by Printing a Sheet every other Week for Tryal, by which in a little time, all will become new that us'd formerly to be Old. Jan'y. 12, 1719." "The Undertaker of this News-Letter, the 12th January last being the Second Week of this Currant Years Intelligence, gave then Intimation that after 14 (now upwards of 15) years experience, it was impossible with half a Sheet a Week to carry on all the Public Occurrences of Europe, with those of this, our Neighbouring Provinces, and the West Indies. To make up which Deficiency, and the News Newer and more acceptable, he has since Printed every other Week a Sheet, whereby that which seem'd Old in the former half Sheets, becomes New now by the Sheet, which is easy to be seen by any one who will be at the pains to trace back former years; and even this time 12 Months, we were then 13 Months behind with the Foreign News beyond Great Britain, and now less than Five Months, so that by the Sheet we have retrieved about 8 months since January last, and any One that has the News Letter since that time, to January next (life permitted) will be accommodated with all the News of Europe &amp;c., contained in the Publick Prints of London that are needful for to be known in these parts. And in regard the Undertaker had not suitable encouragement, even to Print half a Sheet Weekly, seeing that he cannot vend 300 at an Impression, tho' some ignorantly concludes he Sells upwards of a Thousand: far less is he able to Print a Sheet every other week, without an Addition of 4, 6 or 8 Shillings a Year, as every one thinks fit to give payable Quarterly, which will only help to pay for Press and Paper, giving his Labour for nothing. And considering the great Charge he is at for several Setts of Public Prints, by sundry Vessels from London, with the price of Press, Paper, Labour, carrying out the News Papers, and his own Trouble, in collecting and composing, &amp;c. It is afforded by the Year, or by the Piece or Paper, including the difference of Money far cheaper than in England, where they Sell several Hundreds nay Thousands of Copies to a very small number vended here. Such therefore as have not already paid for the half Year past the last Monday of June, are hereby desired to send or pay in the same to John Campbell at his House in Cornhill, Boston. August 10, 1719." Campbell's difficulties increased. A new postmaster had just been appointed, and in the December following the publication of the foregoing advertisements, that postmaster began publishing another newspaper. Campbell appeared to be displeased; a "paper war" of short duration ensued. (See Appendix C.) Both papers were continued; and advertising customers began to increase. In No. 821, January 11, 1721, Campbell again addressed his customers, and informed them, "This Publick Letter of Intelligence was begun here at Boston by John Campbell the 24th of April 1704, near upon Sixteen Years ago, and ever since continued Weekly with Universal Approbation and General Satisfaction, giving a true Account of all the Publick Affairs of Europe, with those of this and the Neighbouring Provinces, for the Interest and Advantage of the Post Office, Gentlemen, Merchants and others, both in Town and Country; and preventing a great many false Reports. And the Author being still desired and encouraged to carry on the same by the Gentlemen, Merchants and others, his usual Customers, he intends (Life Permitted) to answer their expectation, and to forward still as regular Account of Affairs as our part of the World will admit of; If he does not Print a Sheet every other Week this Winter Time, he designs to make it up in the Spring, when Ships do arrive from Great Britain. Such Others as have a mind to promote and encourage the said Intelligence may agree with John Campbell in Cornhill, Boston, and have it on reasonable Terms left at any House in the Town, Seal'd or Unsealed; and for the advantage of the Post Office an Intire Sheet of Paper, one half with the News, and the other half good writing Paper to write their Letter on, may also be had there for any one that pleases to have it every Monday." By the latter part of this advertisement we are to understand, that some copies of the News Letter would every Monday be printed on a whole sheet of writing paper, one half of which would be blank, on which letters might be written and sent abroad through the medium of the post office; the accommodation was the saving of postage, as a letter and a newspaper might be forwarded in the same sheet; and newspapers thus printed, were sold by Campbell at his house in Cornhill. In No. 876, December 26, 1720, Campbell, in an address to the public, mentioned, that he had published the News-Letter "near upon Seventeen Years," and that it was "the first and only intelligence on the Continent of America, till about a Year past, one was set up at Philadelphia and another here, and how well either the one or the other has answered the said Design, and People's great Expectation, is left with every one to Determine." He informs his readers that, "he designs (God willing) to carry it on another year," with the usual proviso, that "he is Encouraged by a competant Numbers taking it by the Year, to enable him to defray the necessary charges of Press, Paper, the Publick Prints, and Writing of the same." On the 7th of August, 1721, a third newspaper in Boston was published, entitled The New England Courant.1 1 Printed by James Franklin. The publisher of that paper, in an address to the public, hinted that the News Letter was "a dull vehicle of intelligence," &amp;c. This appears to have nettled Campbell, who in his next News-Letter of Monday, August 14, made the following defence. "?N. B. On Monday last, the 7th Currant, came forth a Third Newspaper in this Town, Entituled, The New England Courant, by Homo non unius Negotii,2 2 The motto of Franklin's address to the public. Or, Jack of all Trades, and it would seem Good at none, giving some very, very frothy fulsome Account of himself; but lest the continuance of that stile should offend his readers, wherein with submission, (I speak for the Publisher of this Intelligence, whose endeavours has always been to give no offence, not meddling with things out of his Province) the said Jack promises in pretence of Friendship to the other News-Publishers to amend, like soure Ale in Summer, Reflecting too too much, that my performances are now and then very, very Dull, Misrepresenting my candid endeavours (according to the Talent of my Capacity and Education, not soaring above my Sphere) in giving a true and genuine account of all Matters of Fact, both Foreign and Domestick, as comes any way well Attested, for these Seventeen Years &amp; an half past. It is often observed, a bright Morning is succeeded by a dark Rainy Day, and so much Mercury in the beginning may end in Album Grœcum. And seeing our New Gentleman seems to be a Scholer of Accademical Learning, (which I pretend not to, the more my unhappiness, and too late to say, O mihi prœteritos referat si Jupiter Annos) and better qualified to perform a work of this Nature, for want whereof out of a design for publick good made me at first at the Sollicitation of several Gentlemen, Merchants and Others, come into it, according to the Proverb, thinking that half a Loafe was better than no Bread; often wishing and desiring in Print that such a one would undertake it, and then no one should sooner come into it and pay more Yearly to carry it on than this Publisher, and none appearing then, nor since, (others being judges) to excell him in their performances, made him to continue. And our New Publisher being a Scholler and Master, he should (me thinks) have given us (whom he terms low, flat and dull) Admonition and told one and the other wherein our Dulness lay, (that we might be better Proficients for the future, Whither in reading, hearing, or pains taking, to write, gather, collect and insert the Publick Occurrences) before publick Censure, and a good example to copy and write after, and not tell us and the World at his first setting out, that he'l be like us in doing as we have done, Turpe est Doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum. And now all my Latin being spent excepting what I design always to remember, Nemo sine crimine vivit, I promise for my part so soon as he or any Scholler will Undertake my hitherto Task, and Endeavours, giving proof that he will not be very, very Dull, I shall not only desist for his advantage, but also so far as capable Assist such a good Scribe." I have a file of the New England Courant for the first two years of its publication, with the exception of the first sixteen numbers, which are wanting. I cannot, therefore, give Franklin's reply to Campbell; but the spirit of it is to be discovered from Campbell's rejoinder, published in the News Letter, August 28, 1721, viz.: ?"J. C. to Jack Dullman1 1 This nickname appears to have been given to Franklin by Campbell, as a retort for calling the News-Letter "dull, very dull." sendeth, Greeting. "Sir, What you call a Satyrical Advertisement was a just Vindication of my News Letter, from some unfair Reflections, in your introduction to your first Courant. Your reply in hobling Verse, had they more Reason and less Railing might possibly have inclined me to think you was some Man of great Learning, or as you please to Word it, a Meikle Man; but Railery is the talent of a mean Spirit, and not to be returned by me. In honour to the Muses I dare not acknowledge your Poem to be from Parnassus; but as a little before the Composure you had been Rakeing in the Dunghill, its more probable the corrupt Steams got into your Brains, and your Dullcold Skul precipitate them into Ribaldry.

I do not envy your skill in Anatomy, and your accurate discovery of the Gall Bladder, nor your Geography of the Dunghill (natale solum.)

"Since like the Indian Natives, you Delight, to murder in the dark, eshun and fly the light, Farewel." This rivalship produced a whole sheet weekly from Campbell for about two months, after which the News-Letter, like the Gazette and Courant, was reduced to a half sheet weekly. In January, 1722, Campbell announced in his usual manner his intention to continue the News-Letter another year; but before the close of it, he resigned his right to his printer, Bartholomew Green. Campbell had published this paper eighteen years; and, during that period, had met with many difficulties, and received but little encouragement. The undertaking could not have been attended with profit; for the expense of paper, printing, and European publications from which he selected information, must have swallowed up the proceeds from his small number of subscribers. "Published by Authority," had been omitted in the title of the News-Letter for two years before Campbell resigned it, but was resumed when Green began to print it on his own account; and the day of its publication was changed from Monday to Thursday. When Green became the proprietor of the News-Letter, great difference of opinion existed in the colony respecting the concerns of church and state, as well as concerning matters of a more local nature, and the spirit of party ran high. A writer of that day observes, "The press has long groaned in bringing forth an hateful but numerous brood of party pamphlets, malicious scribbles, and Billingsgate ribaldry, which have produced rancor and bitterness, and unhappily soured and leavened the tempers of persons formerly esteemed some of the most sweet and amiable.1 1 Courant. No. 30, February 11, 1723. Green appeared to possess a disposition to publish an impartial and chaste paper, and in conformity to this inclination, he inserted in the News-Letter March 7, 1723, the following address to the public. ?"The Design of this Paper is not merely to amuse the Reader; much less to Gratify any Ill Tempers by Reproach or Redicule, to Promote Contention, or Espouse any Party among us. The Publisher on the contrary, laments our Dangerous and unhappy Divisions; and he would always approve himself as a Peaceable Friend and Servant to all, and unkind to none; nor would he ever render Evil for Evil, either by action, speaking or writing. He longs for the Blissful Times when Wars shall cease to the Ends of the Earth. He would rather Endeavour his utmost to advance an universal Concord and Harmony; were it not for fear of adding Oyl to the Flames, and he Remembers the Fable which shows him the Danger of Interceding between Fierce and Contending Enemies. The Publisher would therefore strive to oblige all his Readers by Publishing those Transactions only, that have no Relation to any of our Quarrels, and may be equally entertaining to the greatest Adversaries. For this end, he Proposes to extend his Paper to the History of Nature among us, as well as of Political and Foreign Affairs. And agreeable to this Design, he Desires of all Ingenious Gentlemen, in every part of the Country, to communicate the Remarkable Things they observe; and he Desires them to send their Accounts Post-Free, and nothing but what they assuredly know; and they shall be very gratefully Receiv'd and Publish'd: That so this Paper may, in some Degree, serve for the Philosophical Transactions of New England, as well as for a Political History; and the Things worthy of Recording in this as well as in other Parts of the World, may not proceed to sink into eternal Oblivion as they have done in all the past Ages of the Aboriginal and Ancient Inhabitants." In 1725, "Published by Authority," again disappeared from the title of the News-Letter. Green continued its publication without any thing particular attending it, until the last week of December 1726, No. 1196. The week following he altered its title to The Weekly News-Letter, and began this alteration of title with No. 1, and discontinued "the method of carrying on a Thread of occurrences of an Old Date;" intending to publish weekly the latest intelligence he could procure. The paper, with the alteration of title, progressed to No. 200, October 29, 1730; Green then added the No. 200 of the Weekly News-Letter, to the former number 1196 of the Boston News-Letter, and the following week began with No. 1397, and combined the former and the latter title, calling it The Boston Weekly News-Letter.1 1 Green did not publish two papers at the same time, as mentioned in the Historical Collections, vol. VI, page 67. On this occasion he published the following advertisement, viz.: "The Publisher of this Boston News-Letter, having in concert with the late Mr. Campbell, began to Print the same with Numb. 1, on April 24, 1704, and it being carried on with the History of Publick Affairs to No. 1196, which was on December 29, 1726, and then with January 5th, 1726–7, began with a new Number which amounted on the last Thursday to 200. It is now tho't adviseable to add the said Number 200, to the former 1196, which makes 1396, the whole of our Number from the said 24th of April, 1704, and now go on with Numb. 1397," &amp;c. No other alteration in the News-Letter took place during its publication by Green. He dying, John Draper succeeded him, and began the publication of the News-Letter January 4, 1733. He announced it as follows. ?"Mr. Bartholomew Green, who has for some Years past been the Publisher of this Boston Weekly News-Letter, being dead, this is to Inform the Publick in general, and those who are the Customers for it in particular, that it will be yet carried on, and sent out every Week on Thursday Morning at the usual Price by John Draper, (Son-in-Law to the said Mr. Green) who has been an Assistant with him in the said News-Letter: And, that Care will be yet constantly taken to insert therein all the most remarkable Occurrences, both Foreign and Domestick, that come to hand well attested. And all the Rev. Ministers, or other Gentlemen, both of Town and Country, who may at any time receive any thing worthy of publishing, are desired to send it to the said John Draper, at the Printing-House in Newbury-Street, that lately belong'd to the said Mr. Green deceas'd, and it will be thankfully received, and communicated to the Publick: And it will yet be endeavoured to render This Weekly Paper as informing and entertaining as possibly can be, to the Satisfaction of all who do or may encourage it." Draper printed the News Letter thirty years. He died in November, 1762, and his son Richard Draper continued its publication. At that time, the title was enlarged as follows: The Boston Weekly News Letter and New England Chronicle. In about a year the title was again altered to The Massachusetts Gazette; and Boston Newes Letter, and was decorated with the king's arms.1 1 The king's arms were first introduced into the title page of the Laws of Massachusetts, 1692. Richard Draper, about this time, took his kinsman Samuel as a partner, and the imprint ran thus: "Published by Richard Draper, Printer to the Governor and Council, and by Samuel Draper, at the Printing Office in Newbury Street." After the death of Samuel Draper, Richard remained several years without a partner. In May, 1768, a singular disposition was made of the paper. The dispute between Great Britain and the colonies induced the government particularly to patronize The Massachusetts Gazette, and another paper, the Boston Post Boy and Advertiser, printed by Green and Russell. To give them the features and the consequence of governmental papers, the publishers of them were directed to insert in the title of each paper, "Published by Authority." The News Letter was published on Thursdays, and the Post Boy on Mondays. Each paper was divided into two equal parts. Half of each paper was entitled, "The Massachusetts Gazette, Published by Authority;" and the other half bore their former respective titles. For instance, the old title of Boston News Letter was reassumed, and under this title, news and advertisements filled one half of a whole sheet; the other half of this sheet was entitled, "The Massachusetts Gazette, Published by Authority;" the contents of this half, like the other, being news, advertisements, and, occasionally, the proceedings of government and public bodies. The same method was taken by Green and Russell. One half of the sheet bore the title of Post Boy and Advertiser, and the other half that of "The Massachusetts Gazette, Published by Authority." Two hundred and seventy-six weeks previously to this new mode of publication, Draper had added Massachusetts Gazette to the title of the News Letter. Green and Russell began publishing in the mode described, on Monday, and Draper on Thursday of the week. Green and Russell therefore numbered that part of their sheet which was to bear the title of Massachusetts Gazette, 277. Draper on the Thursday following numbered his 278, and as long as this mode of publishing the Gazette by authority continued, the number for one press was reckoned from that of the other. It was in fact publishing a half sheet Gazette "By Authority" twice in a week, once by Draper and once by Green and Russell. Each press furnished the royal arms for the head of the Gazette. The first time Draper published this "Adam and Eve paper," joined together "by authority," the following advertisement was inserted after the title of the News-Letter. "The Thursday's paper1 1 There was at this time no other newspaper printed on Thursdays in Boston. (the first ever printed in America) returns to its primitive Title, the Gazette being directed by Authority to be published in another manner. The customers will be served with Care and Fidelity; and those who advertise herein may depend on having their Notifications well circulated. "N. B. A Gazette will accompany the News Letter every Thursday (tho' not always in a separate paper) Articles of Intelligence and of publick Utility will be thankfully received, and due notice taken of them by directing to Richard Draper." This method of publishing the Gazette was discontinued at the close of September 1769, and Draper reestablished the title as it stood at the beginning of May, 1768, viz. The Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter. "Published by Authority," was omitted; but it continued to be a government paper. In May, 1774, Draper took John Boyle as a partner in publishing the News Letter; the next month Draper died. His widow, Margaret Draper, succeeded him as proprietor of the paper, and Boyle was for a short time her partner; but they separated before the commencement of the revolutionary war. After the war began, John Howe became her partner, and remained in business with her until the British troops left Boston in 1776; when the publication of the News-Letter ceased, and was never revived. Thus began and ended The Boston News Letter. It was the first newspaper published in this country, and the only one printed in Boston during the siege. I have taken more particular notice of this first paper, than I shall of those which follow. It was published seventy-two years. For several years before the revolution, many able writers on the side of government, and some of its first officers, under various signatures, appeared in this paper; and while conducted by Richard Draper, its collection of news was not inferior to that of any public journal in Boston. John Campbell, the first proprietor, lived about five years after he resigned his right to Green. His death is thus mentioned in the News Letter of March 7, 1728. "On Monday Evening last, the 4th Currant, about 8 a Clock, died here John Campbell, Esq, Aged 75 Years, formerly Post Master in this Place, Publisher of the Boston News Letter for many Years, and One of his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of Suffolk." NEW-ENGLAND.    No. 1. THE Boston Gazette. Ship.    Post Boy. Published by Authority. From Monday December 14, to Monday December 21, 1719. This newspaper was first published for William Brooker, who succeeded Campbell as postmaster. It was the second which made its appearance in British America. No. 1 was issued from the press on Monday, December 21, 1719, on a half sheet of printing foolscap, on a small pica type, folio; and it was continued on a half sheet of that size of paper for several years, excepting occasionally a whole sheet, and then one page was often left blank. It had a cut of a ship on the left, and one of a postman on the right of the title, and was "Published by Authority." Its imprint was, "Boston: Printed by J. Franklin, and may be had at the Post Office, where advertisements are taken in." This paper also began the year with March the first year, but the following with January. The appearance of the Gazette1 1 There were three Boston Gazettes in succession before the revolution. This was the first of them. occasioned some altercation between its publisher and the publisher of the News-Letter. In No. 3, we have the following advertisement. "Post Office, January 4th. The Approbation this Paper has already met with from the better Part of the Town, deserves a suitable Acknowledgment from this office, with repeated assurances, that it shall be carried on in such a manner as to render it both beneficial and entertaining." The proprietor, printer and publisher of the Gazette, were soon changed. Philip Musgrave succeeded Brooker as postmaster a few weeks after the Gazette was published. No. 36, is printed by S. Kneeland; and the imprint of No. 41, is, "Boston Printed by S. Kneeland, for Philip Musgrave, Post Master, at his Office in Corn-Hill, where Advertisements are taken in, and all Gentlemen and others, may be Accommodated with this Paper." The Gazette was printed by Kneeland for Musgrave until 1726, and that year it was printed by Kneeland for Thomas Lewis, postmaster. In 1727, Henry Marshall was postmaster, and the Gazette had another printer, Bartholomew Green, son of the printer of the News-Letter. It was printed for Marshall till May, 1732, when he died, and the Gazette was after his death published by John Boydell, who succeeded Marshall, and was again printed by Kneeland and his partner. In 1734, Ellis Huske, being appointed postmaster, began the publication of another paper, The Post-Boy; but Boydell continued to publish the Gazette till he died in December, 1739;2 2 From the Boston Gazette, of December 17, 1739. "On Tuesday last died here in the 49th year of his age, John Boydell, Esq.; late Publisher of this Paper, and some time Deputy Post-Master within this and the three neighboring Governments; than whom none ever lived in this Province more generally esteem'd and beloved, as an honest worthy man, by Persons of all Ranks, Perswasions and Parties, or was more lamented as such at his Death. He first came over from England into this Country in the year 1716, Secretary to the late worthy Governor Shute, and Register of the Court of Vice Admiralty for this Province, New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island; after which he was appointed Register of the Court of Probate of Wills, &amp;c., for the County of Suffolk, and Naval officer for the Port of Boston; all which offices he discharged with such singular diligence, integrity and goodness, that this community never lost a more useful and valuable member, than he was in his degree and station." The Boston Gazette, of the same date, contains the following advertisement: "This is to acquaint the Publick, That this Paper will be carried on as usual for the Benefit of the Family of the late Publisher Mr. John Boydell, deceased." and, it then was printed for his heirs until October, 1741, when Kneeland &amp; Green became the proprietors of it. Four postmasters in succession had conducted The Boston Gazette, before it was owned by Kneeland &amp; Green. When this paper became their property, they incorporated it with The New England Weekly Journal, which they had printed on their own account for nearly fifteen years. The title was altered to The Boston Gazette and Weekly Journal, to show that the Journal was combined with the Gazette. Kneeland &amp; Green continued to publish the Gazette in this altered form until 1752. This paper then, after having been published thirty-three years, was succeeded by another with the same title, which I shall mention in its place. When Kneeland &amp; Green began to publish the Gazette and Journal conjointly, on their own account, they printed it on a half sheet of paper of the size of foolscap, in quarto, and introduced new devices. "Published by Authority," had been omitted in the title many years. While the Gazette was printed for Boydell, its size was altered to a half sheet crown, in quarto; and, after he quitted the postoffice, the cut of a postman on horseback, on the right of the title, was exchanged for a pine tree. When Kneeland &amp; Green began to publish it for themselves, the cut of a ship was placed on the right of the title; the pine tree was omitted, and the cut of a news-carrier, holding a Gazette in his hand, was introduced on the left. After printing it several years in quarto, they again printed it on a half sheet foolscap, folio; but occasionally in quarto. This paper was discontinued in 1752, on account of the dissolution of the partnership of its publishers. The New-England COURANT. This was the third newspaper which made its appearance in Boston. It was first printed and published Monday, August 17, 1721, by James Franklin, on a half sheet of crown size printing paper, on a small pica type, occasionally on long primer, but after two years generally on pica. It was printed on Saturdays during the latter years of its publication. Imprint—"Boston: Printed by James Franklin, in Queen Street, where Advertisements are taken in." Among the reasons which induced Franklin to publish the Courant, probably one, which was not the least considerable, was grounded on the circumstance of the publisher of the Gazette having taken the printing of it from him, and given it to another printer. He warmly attacked Musgrave, the publisher of the Gazette, in some of the first numbers of the Courant, and endeavored to have him turned out of office. The Courant contained very little news, and very few advertisements. More than half of the paper was, with few exceptions, filled weekly with essays, in which men in office, the clergy, and the prevailing religious opinions of the day, were attacked. Inoculation for the small pox, then newly introduced, was warmly, if not rudely, opposed. A society of gentlemen furnished these essays. By moderate people this society was called a set of "Free Thinkers;" by others, it was denominated the "Hell Fire Club." The essays of this society were at times opposed in the Gazette, and in the News Letter; and these papers in turn were warmly attacked in the Courant, but rather by satire than argument. Some of the essays in the Courant were evidently written by men of talent. A periodical paper with these animating features was a novelty in Boston; and of course attracted general notice, and soon had warm advocates and zealous opposers. It roused the attention of the government, and excited clerical resentment. The reverend Doctor Increase Mather was one of the first who openly denounced the Courant, by an address to the public, inserted in the Boston Gazette, January 29, 172?. This address may afford entertainment to many who are acquainted with the present management of the press. It is as follows: "Advice to the Publick from Dr. Increase Mather. Whereas a wicked Libel called the New England Courant, has represented me as one among the Supporters of it; I do hereby declare, that altho' I had paid for two or three of them, I then, (before the last Courant was published) sent him word I was extremely offended with it! In special, because in one of his Vile Courants he insinuates, that if the Ministers of God approve of a thing, it is a Sign it is of the Devil; which is a horrid thing to be related! And altho' in one of the Courants it is declared, that the London Mercury Sept. 16, 1721, affirms that Great Numbers of Persons in the City and Suburbs are under the Inoculation of the Small Pox; In his next Courant he asserts, that it was some Busy Inoculator, that imposed on the Publick in saying so; Whereas I myself saw and read those words in the London Mercury: And he doth frequently abuse the Ministers of Religion, and many other worthy Persons in a manner, which is intolerable. For these and such like Reasons I signified to the Printer, that I would have no more of their Wicked Courants. I that have known what New England was from the Beginning, cannot but be troubled to see the Degeneracy of this Place. I can well remember when the Civil Government would have taken an effectual Course to suppress such a Cursed Libel! which if it be not done I am afraid that some Awful Judgment will come upon this Land, and that the Wrath of God will arise, and there will be no Remedy. I cannot but pity poor Franklin, who, tho' but a Young Man, it may be Speedily he must appear before the Judgment Seat of God, and what answer will he give for printing things so vile and abominable? And I cannot but Advise the Supporters of this Courant to consider the Consequences of being Partakers in other Mens Sins, and no more Countenance such a Wicked Paper. January 24th, 1721."1 1 Old style, beginning the year with March, which places January in 1721, instead of 1722 agreeably to the new style. This address was attacked in the next Courant with considerable ability; and its writers went on as usual. The New-England Courant had not been published twelve months before Franklin was apprehended by an order from government, and imprisoned four weeks in the common jail. Besides this punishment of the publisher, the council further manifested their disapprobation of the Courant by the following resolve. "In Council, July 5th, 1722." "Whereas in the Paper called the New England Courant, printed Weekly by James Franklin, many passages have been published boldly reflecting on His Majesty's Government and on the Administration of it in this Province, the Ministry, Churches and College; and it very often contains Paragraphs that tend to fill the Readers minds with vanity to the Dishonor of God, and disservice of Good Men. "Resolved, that no such Weekly Paper be hereafter Printed or Published without the same be first perused and allowed by the Secretary, as has been usual. And that the said Franklin give Security before the Justices of the Superior Court in the Sum of 100l. to be of the good Behaviour to the End of the next Fall Sessions of this Court. Sent down for Concurrence." "Read and Non-concurred." The failure of the council to restrain the freedom of the press in respect to the Courant, and the release of its printer from imprisonment, encouraged the club to proceed with increased boldness. An essay published the week following is thus headed: "And then, after they had anathematized and curs'd a Man to the Devil, and the Devil did not, or would not take him, then to make the Sheriff and the Jaylor to take the Devil's Leavings. Postscript to Hickeringill's Sermons on the horrid Sin of Man Catching, Page 39." The club also published the twenty-ninth chapter of Magna Charta, with comments;1 1 Dr. Franklin mentions this club. See his Life. and then applied the Lash,2 2 No. 52 has this advertisement. "This paper (No. 52), begins the fifth quarter, and those that have not paid for THE LASH are desired to send in their money, or pay it to the Bearer." [See Buckingham's Newspaper Literature, vol. I, p. 66, correcting this note.—M.] as it was termed, with the greater energy, especially to the governor and some of the clergy. The governor soon after went to England.3 3 Shute. On the 14th January, 1723, the council again took The New-England Courant into consideration, and passed an order thereon, which was sent down to the house of representatives. In consequence of which the following act was passed, and ordered to be published three weeks successively in The Boston News Letter, and in the Boston Gazette. "At a great &amp; General Court of Assembly of His Majesty's Province of the Massachusetts-Bay, held at Boston the fifteenth Day of November, 1722. "In Council, Jan. 14, 1722.1 1 At this time, in all legal proceedings, the year began with March, of course the Month of January, 1722, was attached to the latter part of that year; but generally the year beginning with January, would carry this month into 1723, as has been already stated. "Whereas the Paper called The New England Courant, of this Day's date, contains many Passages in which the Holy Scriptures are perverted, and the Civil government, Ministers and People of this Province highly reflected on, Ordered, That William Tailer, Saml. Sewal, and Penn Townsend, Esqrs. with such as the Honourable House of Representatives shall join, be a Committee to consider and Report what is proper for this Court to do thereon. "Sent down for Concurrence. J. Willard, Secretary." "In the House of Representatives, Jan. 14th, 1722. Read and Concurred, and Mr. Fulham, Mr. Remington, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Knolton be joined with them. John Clark, Speaker." "The Committee appointed to consider of the Paper called The New England Courant, published Monday the Fourteenth, Currant, are humbly of Opinion that the Tendency of the said Paper is to mock Religion, and bring it into Contempt, that the Holy Scriptures are therein profanely abused, that the Reverend and Faithful Ministers of the Gospel are injuriously reflected on, His Majesty's Government affronted, and the Peace and good Order of His Majesty's Subjects of this Province disturbed, by the said Courant; And for prevention of the like Offence for the Future, the Committee humbly propose, That James Franklin, the Printer and Publisher thereof, be strictly forbidden by this Court, to Print or Publish the New England Courant, or any Pamphlet or Paper of the like Nature, except it be first supervised by the Secretary of this Province; And the Justices of his Majesty's Sessions of the Peace for the County of Suffolk, at their next Adjournment, be directed to take sufficient Bonds of the said Franklin, for his good Behaviour for Twelve Months Time. "Per Order of the Committee. William Tailer." "In Council Jan. 15th, 1722. Read and Accepted." "Sent down for Concurrence. J. WILLARD, Secretary." "In the House of Representatives, Jan. 16, 1722. Read and Concurr'd. John Clark, Speaker." "Consented to.    W. Dummer."    A true Copy. Examined per J. Willard, Secretary." Notwithstanding this act of government, Franklin published the Courant on the Monday following without submitting its contents to the Secretary. For this neglect, a "Bill of Indictment was some months after preferred to the grand jury against him for contempt of an order of the general court." The jury returned Ignoramus on the bill, but Franklin was bound to the good behavior pursuant to the order of the General court." The act of government was voluntarily published in the Courant; and it also appeared in The American Weekly Mercury of February 26th, 172 2/3, published in Philadelphia, with the following severe remarks, which were unquestionably furnished by the Courant club in Boston, viz. "My Lord Coke observes, That to punish first and then enquire, the Law abhors, but here Mr. Franklin has a severe sentence pass'd upon him even to the taking away Part of his Livelihood, without being called to make Answer. An Indifferent Person would judge by this vote against Couranto, That the Assembly of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay are made up of Oppressors and Bigots who make Religion only the Engine of Destruction to the People; and the rather, because the first Letter in the Courant of the 14th of January (which the Assembly Censures) so naturally represents and exposes the Hypocritical Pretenders to Religion. Indeed, the most famous Politicians in that Government (as the infamous Gov. D—and his Family) have ever been remarkable for Hypocrisy; and it is the general Opinion that some of their Rulers are rais'd up and continued as a Scourge in the Hands of the Almighty for the Sins of the People. Thus much we could not forbear saying, out of Compassion to the distressed People of the Province, who must now resign all Pretences to Sense and Reason, and submit to the Tyranny of Priestcraft, and Hypocrisy. P. S. By private Letters from Boston we are informed, That the Bakers there are under great Apprehensions of being forbid baking any more Bread, unless they will submit to the Secretary as Supervisor General and Weigher of the Dough, before it is baked into Bread, and offered to Sale." Franklin and the Courant Club did not choose to submit the contents of that paper, before publishing it, to the secretary of the government for his approbation. After deliberating what was best to be done to evade the act, it was determined to alter the imprint by leaving out the name of James, and inserting that of Benjamin Franklin.1 1 The Courant, No. 80, was thus introduced to the public. "The late Publisher of this Paper finding so many inconveniences would arise by his carrying the Manuscripts and publick News to be supervis'd by the Secretary, as to render his carrying it on unprofitable, has intirely dropt the Undertaking: The present Publisher of this Paper, having receiv'd the following Piece, desires the Readers to accept of it as a Preface to what they may hereafter meet with in this Paper." Then follows an address to the public in which the club are mentioned as the writers in the Courant, and that one of them designated by the name of "Old Janus, is Couranteer." The following is an extract from this address. "The main Design of this Weekly Paper will be to entertain the Town with the most comical and diverting Incidents of Human Life, which in so large a place as Boston, will not fail of a universal Exemplification: Nor shall we be wanting to fill up these Papers with a grateful interspersion of more serious Morals, which may be drawn from the most ludicrous and odd Parts of Life." [A reprint in fac simile of this Courant, No. 80, was issued in 1856, in which it was claimed that it had been printed on a press once used by Benjamin Franklin. It corresponds with the description given above, and is dated February 11, 1723. At the end is this notice: "*†* This paper having met with so general an Acceptance in Town and Country, as to require a far greater Number of them to be printed, than there is of the other publick Papers; and it being besides more generally read by a vast Number of Borrowers, who do not take it in, the Publisher thinks proper to give this publick Notice for the Incouragement of those who would have Advertisements inserted in the public Prints, which they may have printed in this Paper at a moderate Price." —M.] This determination was carried into immediate effect. The Courant now purported to be "printed and sold by Benjamin Franklin in Queen Street," although he was a minor. The club proceeded without any apparent mitigation of "the Lash." The Courant was published in the name of Benjamin Franklin for some time after he left his brother; and, for anything that appears, until its publication ceased in the beginning of the year 1727. Before this paper was discontinued, the writers for it became languid, and for months in succession no original essay appeared. James Franklin, at a subsequent period, removed to Newport, and established the first press in Rhode Island. The Courant was published about six years. AI     Numb. I. The NEW-ENGLAND Weekly JOURNAL. Containing the most Remarkable Occurrences Foreign and Domestick. This paper was first published March 20th, 1727, on a half sheet of foolscap size, folio. At first it was published on Mondays; but, after several years, Tuesday was substituted. Imprint—"Boston, Printed by S. Kneeland, at the Printing-House in Queen-Street, where Advertisements are taken in." See Appendix D. During the first year of the Journal, several literary gentlemen furnished it with short essays on miscellaneous subjects, more however of a moral than a political nature, and which, although well written, did not occasion the excitement in the public mind which was produced by the writers for the Courant. The first year, the editor of the Journal assumed the name of "Proteus Echo, Esq." In No. 3, he requests those who will do him the honor to contribute to the embellishment of his Journal, to direct to him at Mr. Samuel Kneeland's in Queen-Street; and he gives a humorous account of himself. In No. 4, he describes, in the same manner, his associates, among whom he mentions "two divines who sometimes did themselves the honor of half an hour's setting," &amp;c., and observes, that the gentlemen, whom he had described, "will have no inconsiderable hand in these weekly entertainments." At the close of the first year, the editor presents his "gratitude to those generous hands which have made such considerable presents to the authors of these Essays." He mentions a piece of Spanish gold from a gentleman, and a silver pen from a lady; and he then informs his readers that, a year being completed since the first publication of the Journal, the essay then published "is the last piece which will be published by the gentlemen who begun and have till now supplied this paper." He concludes by observing that the writers were three in number, one of whom supplied the poetry, and signed his pieces with one of the letters composing the word Musœ. The second year, the Journal was not supplied with original essays;1 1 A reprint in fac simile of No. LV of this paper, dated April 8, 1728, bears the imprint of S. Kneeland &amp; T. Green. It is stated that "There are Measures concerting for rendring this Paper yet more universally esteemed, and useful, in which 'tis hop'd the Publick will be gratified, and by which those Gentlemen who desire to be improved in History, Philosophy, Poetry, &amp;c. will be greatly advantaged." It is mentioned that the burials in Boston for the past week were five whites and one black. The baptisms in the several churches, nine. A very likely negro woman and a very likely negro girl are advertised to be sold, while Mr. Nathaniel Pigott advertises to open a school for negroes in Mr. Checkley's Meeting House.—M. the third year, it contained eighteen numbers, moral and entertaining, supposed by some to have been principally composed by governor Burnet; they began the January after his arrival at Boston, and ceased a few weeks before his death. I have seen a file of the Journal, containing these numbers, with an index written by a former proprietor of the volume, whom I suppose to have been one of those who wrote for the Journal during the first year of its publication. In this index the eighteen numbers are noticed thus, "Speculation-Govr.. No. 1." 2, &amp;c. The collection of foreign and domestic intelligence for the Journal, even for that day, was but indifferent, though not much inferior to the other Boston papers. In the head, preceding the title, a signature was inserted weekly, the signification of which I have not ascertained—it was a letter of the alphabet; first, A, with a figure after it, was used for several months, changing the figure weekly; then B took the place of A, and so on; but the same letter did not appear to be continued for any definite period. After two or three years, the signature consisted of a letter without a figure. When S. Kneeland had published the Journal four months, to his name in the imprint was added that of T. Green. For the first year of the partnership there was a singularity of this kind. The imprint to the Journal was, "Printed by S. Kneeland and T. Green," etc., yet Green alone, it seems, was responsible for the correctness of the paper, and appears to have been the sole conductor of it. In such advertisements, published in the Journal, as required explanation, the public were requested to "enquire of the Printer." In the Journal of February 3, 1729, the following notice appeared: "The Printer of this paper would have emitted herewith his Desire, that some errors of the last Journal might be laid to his Charge; he not having then any Person by Him to correct the Press as usual, and being since convinced that they are his own; such as "fresh passage, Imation, Piquanry—distin'd—Spectable—Dictors— execated—Vengance—Destracted: with a few other slips which if the Reader pardons, he will oblige The Printer." Immediately after this notice, the imprint, "S. Kneeland &amp; T. Green" stands as usual. This may be explained by observing, that Kneeland committed the printing of the Journal to Green, and for four or five years after their partnership commenced, himself kept a bookshop in King's street. The shop occupied the attention of Kneeland; and although the Journal was printed in the name of Kneeland &amp; Green, yet the former was considered as the proprietor, and the latter as the printer, and the profits were shared between them. Judge Danforth, and the Rev. Mather Byles, the elder, it is said were the principal editors of the Journal, and often corrected the press. Mr. Byles, it is also said, wrote many of the poetical and other essays in that paper. Kneeland gave up his bookshop about the year 1742; and afterwards attended wholly to printing. Essays, etc., were subsequently addressed to the publishers, and people were directed to inquire of the printers, etc. The New England Weekly Journal was published nearly fifteen years by the same printers, and without any alteration of the title or the imprint. At the close of the year 1741, this paper was incorporated with the Boston Gazette by Kneeland &amp; Green, who then became proprietors of that paper, and the title of the paper so consolidated was, The Boston Gazette and Weekly Journal. The imprint was as before, with the addition of "Price 16s. a year, and 20s. seal'd," paid quarterly. The printers of this paper were great advocates of the reverend George Whitefield, the reverend Mr. Edwards, &amp;c. The reverend Thomas Prince was supposed to have taken an active part in the publication of this paper, and for a time to have assisted in correcting the press. The first publication that issued was a general prospectus, without any number. The second publication was numbered 1. The Journal was incorporated with the Gazette in 1741; and, in 1752, the Gazette was discontinued, twenty-five years after the first publication of the Journal. The Weekly Rehearsal. Monday, September 27, 1731. This paper was published on a half sheet of printing foolscap, folio, on a small pica type; and was established by a young gentleman of great literary talents, who afterwards became a celebrated law character;1 1 Jeremiah Gridley, afterwards attorney general of the province of Massachusetts Bay. and Monday was the day of its publication. It was not numbered the first forty-six weeks. The first paper was printed September 27, 1731. The imprint—"Boston: Printed by J. Draper, for the Author, by whom Advertisements are taken in." Afterwards, "Printed by J. Draper, for the Author. Advertisements are taken in by Mr. Hancock, at the Bible and Three Crowns in Ann-Street, 1732." For the first six weeks, mottos in Latin from the classics were inserted after the title. The motto was different in each week; and, for the first six months, with very few exceptions, a moral or entertaining essay was weekly published in the Rehearsal, which usually filled more than half the paper. These essays were sometimes selected, but generally original. Before the termination of one year, its original essays were discontinued, and it had become a mere vehicle of intelligence. Thomas Fleet began to print it with No. 47, and it appears, by an advertisement in that number, that he was interested in the publication. It became a good paper for foreign and domestic news, but was no longer a literary journal. On April 2, 1733, Fleet became the sole proprietor of the Rehearsal, and thus announced it to the public: "The Gentleman who first set up and has hitherto been interested in this Paper, having now resigned all his Right and Interest therein into the hands of the Subscriber, the Subscriber thinks himself obliged to give publick Notice thereof, and informs all such as have taken, or may hereafter take it, that as he has settled a Correspondence with Gentlemen in London, and most of the principal Towns within this and the neighbouring Governments, and is favoured with the Acquaintance of many intelligent Persons in Boston, he doubts not but he shall be able to make the Rehearsal as Useful and entertaining as any of the Papers now published. And the better to effect it, requests all Gentlemen in Town or Country who may be possessed of any thing new or curious, whether in the Way of News or Speculation, worthy the publick View, to send the same to him, and it will be gratefully received and communicated for the Entertainment of the polite and inquisitive Part of Mankind. The publisher of this paper declares himself of no Party, and invites all Gentlemen of Leisure and Capacity, inclined on either Side, to write any thing of a political Nature, that tends to enlighten and serve the Publick, to communicate their Productions, provided they are not overlong, and confined within Modesty and Good Manners; for all possible Care will be taken that nothing contrary to these shall ever be here published. And whereas the publishing of Advertisements in the Weekly News Papers has been found of great Use (especially in such as are sent thro' all the Governments as this is) this may inform all Persons, who shall have Occasion, that they may have their Advertisements published in this Paper upon very easy Terms, and that any Customer for the Paper shall be served much cheaper than others. And whereas the Price of this Paper was set up at twenty Shillings per Year, and so paid till this time; the present Undertaker being willing to give all possible Encouragement to his Readers has now reduced it to Sixteen Shillings; and offers all Gentlemen who are willing to hold a Correspondence, and shall frequently favour him with any thing that may tend to the Embellishment of the Paper, to supply them with one constantly free from Charge. And considering it is impossible for half a Sheet of Paper to contain all the Remarkable News that may happen to be brought in upon the Arrival of Ships from England or other extraordinary Occurrences; the Publisher therefore proposes in all such Cases, to Print a Sheet of what he judges most Material, and shall continue to send the Paper to all such as have hitherto taken it, until he is advised to the contrary by those determined to drop it, which he hopes will not be many. Thomas Fleet." The imprint from No. 79 to 202, August 11, 1735, when the Rehearsal was discontinued, was, "Boston Printed by T. Fleet, at the Heart and Crown in Cornhill, where Advertisements are taken in. Advertisements are also taken in by Mr. N. Belknap, Bookseller, near Clark's Wharf, at the North End. Price 16s. per year." It was Fleet's intention to alter the time of publication from Monday morning to Monday evening, as appears from an advertisement published in the last number of the Rehearsal, viz: "?The Publisher of this Paper hereby gives Notice, that he intends for the Future to print it every Monday Evening (having the Approbation and Advice of several Gentlemen in Town, who are his customers) and will take Care to collect and publish not only the most fresh and authentic Advices from abroad, but also what occurs among Ourselves or Neighbours, worthy the publick View; And all the Readers in Town may depend upon having it left at their Houses some Time before Dark, (unless upon extraordinary Occasions) which may be a Diversion after the Business of the Day, now the Evenings are grown pretty long." But Fleet, the next week, instead of continuing the Rehearsal, published a paper with the title of The Boston Evening Post; he, however, numbered it 203, as a continuation of the Rehearsal; but on the following Monday, the Evening Post was numbered 2. The Rehearsal was discontinued after being published nearly four years. See Evening Post. NEW-ENGLAND. No. 1. THE BOSTON Weekly Post-Boy. Ship. Post-Boy. MONDAY, October, 1734. Postmasters established the first two newspapers published in Boston; and succeeding postmasters seemed to claim a right to such publications, or at least to think that a newspaper was an appendage to their office. Ellis Huske1 1 He was afterward appointed deputy postmaster general for the colonies. He was brother to General Huske, who distinguished himself at the battles of Dettingen and Culloden. He had a son, bred a merchant in Boston, who was afterward a member of the British parliament. Huske was superseded in the department of the post office by Franklin and Hunter. [The son (John) is supposed to be the same who published a work, entitled The Present State of North America, 4to, Lond., 1755; and also the same who, as a member of parliament in 1764, proposed to lay a tax on the colonies, which would amount to £500,000 per annum, which he said they were well able to pay. See Drake's Boston, 598, 679, 708.—H.] being appointed postmaster of Boston, and Boydell not choosing to resign the Boston Gazette, Huske began in October, 1734, the publication of another paper, entitled The Boston Weekly Post-Boy. It was at first printed on a half sheet of small demy, in quarto, but soon after on a half sheet of crown, in quarto, on a small pica type. Huske retained the device of the postman, and the ship, on the right and left of the title, which had hitherto appeared in the Boston Gazette published by his predecessors. The Post-Boy was published on Mondays; no printer's name appeared.2 2 It was, I believe, some time printed by John Bushell. The imprint was, "Boston; Printed for Ellis Huske, Post-Master: Advertisements taken in at the Post Office in King's-Street, over against the North-Door of the Town-House, where all Persons in Town or Country may be supplied with this Paper." This imprint was continued, without the name of the printer, during the twenty years of its publication, which began and ended with Huske. I have never seen any number of this paper after December, 1754; but, I believe, it was continued until within a few weeks of the time when the provincial stamp act took place, in 1755. Nothing extraordinary attended this publication. Its features were much like those of the News-Letter and the Gazette. Towards its close it was reduced to half a sheet foolscap, folio. It was not uncommon for the publishers of the New England Journal, and those of the Gazette, to vary the size of their papers, and to print them on half a sheet folio or quarto, of different sizes, as they found it convenient. Most of the paper then used in America was imported from Europe, and paper of a particular size could not, at all times, be obtained. The devices in the title were twice engraved anew during its publication. Those last engraved were, afterwards, made use of by Green and Russell, when they began to publish The Boston Weekly Advertiser. Numb. 2. THE Boston Evening-Post. Monday, August 25, 1735. Fleet having discontinued the Rehearsal on Monday, August 11, 1735, began the publication of The Boston Evening Post on the evening of the following Monday. It was printed on a half sheet of large foolscap printing paper. He commonly made use of paper of this description, excepting when he printed a whole sheet; then he generally used the smaller size of foolscap or pot. The imprint— "Boston: Printed by T. Fleet, at the Heart and Crown, in Cornhill, where advertisements are taken in at a moderate Price." Excepting in the title, the Evening Post did not differ from the Rehearsal. It was the best newspaper then published in Boston. The selection of entertaining and amusing pieces from London publications, and some of Fleet's own humorous paragraphs gave it animation, and its news were well selected and seasonably published. It interfered very little with political controversy, and not greatly with religious disputes. Fleet was a wit, and no bigot; he did not appear to be a great friend to itinerant preachers; and he was not, like the brethren of the type of that day, afraid to attack the highly popular, and greatly distinguished itinerant preacher Whitefield. A paragraph was published in the Evening Post of March 8, 1741, which was next day taken notice of by the governor and council, who ordered an information to be filed against Fleet, that he might be prosecuted at the next superior court. How the affair ended I never knew, but probably a prosecution did not take place, as Fleet procured five respectable persons to testify to the truth of the contents of the paragraph. See Appendix E. Fleet had a peculiar faculty in wording his advertisements. The following advertisements of negroes appeared in the Evening Post, in April 1758. "To be sold by the Printer of this Paper, a Negro Man, about thirty years old, who can do both Town and Country Business very well, but will suit the Country best, where they have not so many Dram Shops as we have in Boston. He has worked at the Printing Business fifteen or sixteen years; can handle an ax, Saw, Spade, Hoe, or other Instrument of Husbandry as well as most Men, and values himself, and is valued by others, for his skill in Cookery and making of Soap." "Also, a very valuable Negro Woman, about thirty years old, (sold only for her frequent pregnancy), with a fine healthy Boy two years old." In June of the same year, in a dunning advertisement to his customers, he adds, "In the days of Mr. Campbell, who published a newspaper here, which is forty years ago, Paper was bought for eight or nine shillings a Ream,1 1 He did not inform his readers that the paper currency had depreciated. and now tis Five Pounds; his Paper was never more than half a sheet, and that he had Two Dollars a year for, and had also the Art of getting his Pay for it; and that Size has continued till within a little more than one year, since which we are expected to publish a whole Sheet, so that the Paper now stands us in near as much as all the other charges." See Appendix F. Fleet continued to publish the Evening Post until he died, in 1758. His sons, Thomas and John, in copartnership, continued it with much approbation, till April 1775, when the revolutionary war occasioned its immediate termination. It was published forty years.2 2 For a further account of this paper, and of its publisher, see Buckingham's Reminiscences, I, 129, et seq.—M. When T. and J. Fleet succeeded their father, they introduced a cut of their sign, the Heart and Crown, into the centre of the title of the Evening Post, and published it every Monday morning instead of Monday evening. Boston, January 4, 1748. Numb. 1. Cut The Independent  Advertiser. This paper was of a political cast. It was first published Tuesday, January 4, 1748, by Rogers &amp; Fowle, printers and copartners. It was printed on a half sheet of good paper, of crown size, folio, with a new long primer type. The device in the centre of its title was a large cut of Britannia liberating a bird confined by a cord to the arms of France. Britannia is represented sitting, the arms of France lying on the ground before her; the bird is on the wing, but being impeded by the cord, one end of which is fastened to the arms of France, and the other to the bird, Britannia is in the act of cutting the cord with a pair of shears, that the bird may escape. This paper was published weekly on Tuesday, but the day of the week was not mentioned in the title. The imprint: "Boston: Printed and Sold by Rogers &amp; Fowle in Queen-Street, next to the Prison, where Advertisements are taken in at a reasonable Price. And all Gentlemen and others may be supplied with this paper." This, like all the English American newspapers then published, had two columns to a page. The following is an extract from a pertinent and well written address of the publishers to the public: "As our present political state affords Matter for a variety of Thoughts, of peculiar Importance to the good People of New-England, we purpose to insert every thing of that Nature that may be pertinently and decently wrote. For ourselves, we declare we are of no Party, neither shall we promote the narrow and private Designs of any such. We are ourselves free, and our Paper shall be free—free as the Constitution we enjoy—free to Truth, good Manners, and good Sense, and at the same time free from all licentious Reflections, Insolence and Abuse. Whatsoever may be adapted to State and Defend the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, to advance useful Knowledge and the Cause of Virtue, to improve the Trade, the Manufactures, and Husbandry of the Country, whatever may tend to inspire this People with a just and proper Sense of their own Condition, to point out to them their true Interests, and rouse them to pursue it, as also any Piece of Wit and Humor, shall at all Times find (free of Charge,) a most welcome reception. And although we do not altogether depend upon the causal Benevolence of the Publick to supply this Paper, yet we will thankfully receive every Thing from every quarter conducing to the Good of the Publick and our general Design." The Advertiser was supplied with well written essays, chiefly political. A number of gentlemen associated for this purpose, among whom, we are told, was the late governor Samuel Adams. This association consisted of whigs, who advocated the rights of the people against those measures of the government which were supposed to infringe upon the privileges of the province secured by charter. The Advertiser was handsomely printed. It contained but little foreign intelligence, and not much domestic news. Its principal object was political discussion, as the means to rouse the people of the colony to maintain their rights. The continuance of this paper was short. Rogers &amp; Fowle dissolved their copartnership in April, 1750; and, their Independent Advertiser ceased with their connection, after being published two years. Numb. 1. THE Boston   Gazette. OR, WEEKLY   ADVERTISER. Cut. Containing the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick. This paper was published by Samuel Kneeland after the dissolution of his partnership with Timothy Green. It superseded the old Boston Gazette and Weekly Journal, and was created upon its foundation. For the want of a more appropriate device, a very singular cut was used in its title which had been designed and engraved for the lxxvth fable of Croxall's Esop; representing the boy viewing himself in the glass, his little sister, who was offended with his vanity, and their father who moralized on the subject of their difference.1 1 Several of the cuts for Esop's Fables were engraved by a remarkably good workman, whose name was Turner, of Boston. He was the best engraver which appeared in the colonies before the revolution, especially on type metal. D. Fowle having a part of this set of cuts, used them from time to time to decorate the title of The New Hampshire Gazette. This Boston Gazette made its first appearance on Wednesday, January 3, 1753. It was printed on a half sheet of crown, quarto, on a new long primer type, with the following rather singular introduction after the title. "As the Types generally us'd in the Printing of the late Boston Gazette or Weekly Journal,2 2 It had been discontinued several months. are worn out, it has been tho't proper, on the Return of the Year, to alter the Form and Title of this Paper, as it now appears. 'Tis proposed to publish the same, as usual, every Tuesday; and hope Care will be taken to furnish it from Time to Time with the most remarkable Occurrences, both of a foreign and domestick Nature." After the first number it was regularly published every Tuesday, and continued to be printed in quarto, on paper of the same size. No printer or publisher's name appeared in the imprint, which was, "Boston: Printed opposite the prison in Queen street, where Advertisements are taken in." This imprint remained unaltered the first year; the second year Kneeland added his name to it, and exchanged the cut before mentioned, in the title, for a well executed one of the arms of the province.3 3 An Indian with a bow in one hand, an arrow in the other, and a quiver at his back. Kneeland published this Gazette two years, when it was discontinued on account of the provincial stamp act, and never revived. This paper was better printed than the old Boston Gazette, and had, for those days, a considerable number of advertising customers. NUMB. 1. THE Boston GAZETTE, OR COUNTRY JOURNAL. Province arms. Britannia liberating a bird. Containing the freshest advices, Foreign and Domestick. This was the third newspaper bearing the title of The Boston Gazette. No. 1 was published April 7, 1755, on a crown half sheet, from a long primer type. The title had two cuts, which had before been used, the one for the last Boston Gazette, and the other for the Independent Advertiser. The province arms, or the Indian, was placed on the left, and Britannia liberating a bird on the right of the title; but the disproportion in the width of the cuts, Britannia being twice the width of the Indian, pressed the title from the centre of the page, and destroyed the uniformity which would have been preserved had the parts been properly arranged. The imprint, "Boston: Printed by Benjamin Edes and John Gill at their Printing-Office near the East End of the Town-House, in King Street; where all persons may be supplied with this paper, and where Advertisements are taken in. Also printing done at a moderate Rate with Care and Dispatch." Edes and Gill removed soon after to the printing house which had been occupied by Rogers and Fowle, in Prison lane; the imprint was altered and shortened, and the Gazette was occasionally printed on a whole sheet crown. About the year 1760, it became a common custom in Boston to print all newspapers on a whole sheet. Several of the gentlemen who had associated to write for the Independent Advertiser, joined by some others, encouraged the establishment of this paper; they were the editors of its literary department, and the purveyors of its political information. During the long controversy between Great Britain and her American colonies, no paper on the continent took a more active part in defence of the country, or more ably supported its rights, than the Boston Gazette; its patrons were alert and ever at their posts, and they had a primary agency in events which led to our national independence.1 1 The most distinguished revolutionary patriots in Boston, several years preceding 1775, frequently convened at this celebrated Gazette office, and also at that of the Massachusetts Spy. Amongst them were Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Thomas Cushing, Joseph Warren, William Cooper, William Young, etc., etc. It may be truly said, that in those meetings were concocted many of the measures of opposition to the British acts of parliament for taxing the colonies—measures which led to, and terminated in the independence of our country. A provincial stamp act, or, as it was called, "An act for granting to his Majesty several Duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper, for two years, towards the defraying the Charge of this Government," was passed by the legislature of the province a few months before Edes &amp; Gill began the publication of the Boston Gazette, and it took effect the first of May following. The act embraced newspapers, which were to pay one-half penny for each paper. Of the several newspapers which had been established in Boston previously to this period, only three were now in being, viz: the News-Letter, the Evening Post, and this new Boston Gazette. These were all printed from May 1st, 1755, to April 30, 1757, on paper stamped by the colonial government. The figure of the stamp was round, of the size of half a dollar, and the words "HALF PENNY—HALF PENNY," were inclosed between two circular lines, and formed the border; in the centre was a bird, probably meant for an eagle on the wing; this device was stamped with red ink on a corner of the sheet.1 1 Fleet, printer of The Evening Post, the first week he used this stamped paper, published the following, which may serve as a specimen of his talent at rhyming, viz: "On the Pretty Bird in the margin. "The little, pretty Picture here O' th' Side looks well enough, Though nothing to the Purpose is 'Twill serve to set it off." Again, "Although this Emblem has but little in't, You must e'en take it, or you'l have no print." In 1768, after the death of Samuel Kneeland, Edes &amp; Gill occupied his printing house, where the two former Boston Gazettes, and the New England Weekly Journal had been printed. There they continued to publish the Gazette, of which they were proprietors, until April, 1775, when the revolutionary war commenced. Before this event took place, the device in the title underwent a change. The figure of Britannia was exchanged for that of Minerva, seated; before her was a pedestal on which was placed a cage; Minerva with her left hand supported a spear, on which was placed the cap of Liberty, and with her right opened the door of the cage, and liberated a bird which appeared in the act of flying towards a tree that stood at a distance from a city. This cut was coarsely executed. The publication of the Gazette was suspended from April, 1775, to the 5th of June following, when Edes, having set up a press at Watertown, renewed the printing of the paper, and continued it until November, 1776, when he returned to Boston, and again published the Gazette in Queen street. Gill had no concern in printing the Gazette after April, 1775; but in 1776 he began another paper, entitled The Continental Journal. Edes's sons, Benjamin and Peter,2 2 Peter Edes not only printed the Boston Gazette, but the afterwards printed the Kennebec Journal at Augusta, Maine, and the Bangor Gazette at Bangor; and some time during his life printed at Hallowell, Me., Newburyport, and Haverhill, Mass., and at Newport, R. I. He was born Dec. 17th, 1756; and died at Bangor, Me., March 30th, 1840. (See vol. I, p. 139.) Benjamin Edes, son of Peter, printed at Baltimore. Maria, a daughter of Peter, still living at the age of 83, was a compositor in her father's office.—M. were, sometime after his return to Boston, concerned with him in printing the Gazette. In 1784, Edes and his eldest son Benjamin,1 1 Benjamin Edes, jr., was born in Boston, June 5th, 1755, and died there May 15th, 1801, aged 46.—M. only, were together, and published this paper in Cornhill, No. 42,2 2 The houses in Boston were numbered about 1784. under the firm of Edes &amp; Son; and they introduced a new cut—the goddess of liberty was represented standing instead of sitting; this was the only alteration in the device; but the following motto was added and engraved underneath the figures, "Libertas et natale solum." The Gazette was printed afterwards in Marlborough street, and then again in King street, now State street. Some time after, Edes printed and published it on his own account in Kilby street. But the Gazette no more "thundered in the capitol." Its former writers were silent, and age and infirmity overtook its publisher. The paper however, lingered along, unnoticed by its rivals, and almost by the public, to whom it had been a faithful and useful servant, until 1798. Forty-five years having completed their revolutions since its first publication, Edes at this time took his farewell of the public, and the Gazette expired!3 3 See Mr. Buckingham's account of the Boston Gazette, and Edes &amp; Gill, in his Reminiscences, 1, 165, et seq. The following is from a recent newspaper: "The Bangor Whig office was honored on Monday by a visit from the widow of the late Michael Sargent, Esq., and daughter of Peter Edes, who printed the first paper on the Kennebec as well as on the Penobscot. When her father published The Bangor Gazette, in 1816, Maria, then at the age of twenty-seven years, worked regularly at the case, and is, probably, the oldest living female compositor in the United States. She has a lively recollection of events of the past, and relates, with much spirit, incidents and anecdotes of people long since passed away, and known to the public only by history and tradition."—H. Numb. I. THE BOSTON   Weekly Advertiser. Containing the freshest advices,   Foregin and Domestick. Post-Boy. This paper was first published August 22, 1757, by John Green and Joseph Russell, in Queen street, printers and copartners. It was printed weekly, on Mondays, with a new long primer type, on paper of crown size, folio, two columns in a page, and generally on a whole sheet. The imprint—"Boston: Printed by Green and Russell, opposite to the Probate-Office in Queen-Street, where all Persons may be supplied with this Paper at Five Shillings and Four Pence Lawful Money per Annum, and where Advertisements are taken in, and all sorts of Printing Work done at a moderate rate, with Care and Dispatch." After it had been published about two years, the title was altered to Green &amp; Russell's Post-Boy and Advertiser, &amp;c. It was changed a second time, to The Boston Post-Boy and Advertiser; and again to The Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Post-Boy and Advertiser. When its title was The Boston Weekly Advertiser, it had for the first year the cut of the postboy in the centre of the title; the second year the ship was added. The cuts were placed like those in the former Boston Post-Boy, published for Huske, and were identically the same which had been used for that paper; the ship on the left, and the postman on horseback on the right of the title. When the paper was called The Massachusetts Gazette, &amp;c., the old devices were thrown aside, and the king's arms were substituted. Its circulation was not extensive, and it was not distinguished for original essays of any kind, nor as the channel of important intelligence; but it was well printed, and always on good types. All the printers in Boston were on friendly terms respecting business; their papers were all of one size, and the columns and pages of one measure. Draper printed the News-Letter on Thursdays. Columns of news, advertisements, &amp;c., in types, were weekly interchanged by Green &amp; Russell with Draper. They followed this practice as long as the Post-Boy was published by Green &amp; Russell, and found it very convenient. Their readers did not complain, although whole columns, which had been published in the News-Letter on Thursday, appeared again from the same types, on the following Monday, in the Post-Boy. Green and Russell were appointed printers to the British commissioners, and supplied the blanks and other work for the custom house. This induced them, apparently, to become advocates for the measures which the British administration adopted toward the American colonies, and accordingly The Boston Post-Boy, on the 23d of May, 1768, appeared with the insignia of government. It had for several years been printed on a whole sheet, as other newspapers in Boston then were. One-half of this sheet now bore the title of, "The Massachusetts Gazette, Published by Authority;" and the other half, its usual title of Boston Post-Boy, &amp;c., as has been already described.1 1 See account of the Boston News-Letter, published in like manner, at the same time, by Draper. The royal arms were substituted, in the title, for the postman and the ship. This mode of publication continued till September, 1769, when printing the Gazette by Authority was discontinued, and the Post-Boy and Gazette were united under the title of The Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Post-Boy and Advertiser, and the cut of the king's arms was retained. In April, 1773, Green &amp; Russell resigned the printing and publishing of this paper to Mills &amp; Hicks, two young printers, who, having received patronage and encouragement from the officers of the crown, &amp;c., continued it with renewed spirit; and several good writers in favor of government became its supporters, the animation and weight of whose communications attracted more notice from the public for the Post-Boy than it had before received. In this manner the paper was printed until a short time after the commencement of the war in 1775, when it was discontinued. The Weekly Advertiser was published about eighteen years. Vol. I.    No. 1. The Boston Chronicle. MONDAY, December 21, 1767. From the first publication of The Boston Weekly Advertiser, more than ten years passed before an attempt was made to establish another newspaper in that town. During this period four journals, viz: The News-Letter, The Evening Post, The Gazette, and The Advertiser, or Post-Boy, were regularly published. December 21, 1767, The Boston Chronicle was added to the number. It was printed on a whole sheet demy, in quarto, on a broad faced long primer, from an Edinburgh foundery. It was published weekly, on Mondays, for the first year, and intended to imitate in its appearance the London Chronicle. The price per annum, being six shillings and eight pence, was but a very small consideration for a newspaper on a large sheet, and well executed. It was "Printed by Mein and Fleming, in Newbury Street, opposite the White Horse Tavern." Mein and Fleming were Scotchmen. John Mein was a bookseller, and John Fleming a printer. The Chronicle was published by Mein. For the first year, this paper was well supplied with essays on various subjects judiciously selected from British authors, and it contained the celebrated letters of the Pennsylvania Farmer.1 1 John Dickinson, Esq. It grew daily into reputation, and had a handsome list of subscribers. With the beginning of the second year, the size of the paper was altered to a crown folio, and published every Monday and Thursday, without any addition to the price. This was the first newspaper published twice a week in New England. Before the close of the second year of publication, its publisher, Mein, engaged in a political warfare with those who were in opposition to the measures of the British administration. In the Chronicle he abused numbers of the most respectable whigs in Boston; and he was charged with insulting the populace. To avoid the effects of popular resentment, it became necessary for him to leave the country. Fleming continued the Chronicle during the absence of Mein, in the name of the firm; but it had fallen into disrepute, and its subscribers in rapid succession withdrew their names. Many supposed that Mein was privately assisted by the agents of government, and several circumstances rendered this opinion probable. But when the paper lost its subscribers it could neither be profitable to its publishers, nor answer the design of its supporters. Its publication, therefore, ceased on the 25th of June, 1770. On this occasion its remaining subscribers were thus addressed. "? The Printers of the Boston Chronicle return thanks to the Gentlemen who have so long favoured them with their subscriptions, and now inform them that, as the Chronicle in the present state of affairs cannot be carried on, either for their entertainment or the emolument of the Printers, it will be discontinued for some time." It was never revived. The Massachusetts Spy. Vol. I.]    TUESDAY, August 7, 1770.    [Numb. 2. Although The Boston Chronicle had become unpopular, and the times were deemed unfavorable for publishing a new paper; yet, under inauspicious circumstances, an attempt was made to establish one on a new plan. The Massachusetts Spy was calculated to obtain subscriptions from mechanics, and other classes of people who had not much time to spare from business. It was to be published three times a week, viz: on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Twice in the week it was to be printed on a quarter of a sheet, and once on a half sheet. When published in this way, news were conveyed fresh to subscribers, and the contents of a Spy might with convenience be read at a leisure moment. This plan was detailed in the first number, which appeared in July, 1770, and was sent gratis to the inhabitants in all parts of the town. In a short time such a subscription was obtained as to warrant a prosecution of the design, and the publication of the Spy commenced with No. 2, August 7, 1770, and was printed in this form for three months by Z. Fowle and I. Thomas; the partnership was then dissolved; and the Spy was continued by Thomas. but published only on Mondays and Thursdays, each number containing half a sheet of large crown, in quarto. In this manner the Spy was issued three months longer. At the expiration of that time, the object of publishing it in this introductory form being obtained, it was set aside to make way for the appearance of a weekly newspaper on a larger sheet than any that had at that time been published in Boston. Cut. THE Massachusetts Spy. &gt;Cut. A Weekly, Political and Commercial Paper; Open to all Parties, but influenced by None. Vol. I.]    THURSDAY, March 7, 1771.    Numb. I. Number 1, of this newspaper, was published March 7, 1771, on a whole sheet, royal size, folio, four columns in a page. Massachusetts Spy, was in large German text, engraved on type metal between two cuts; the device of the cut on the left was the Goddess of Liberty sitting near a pedestal, on which was placed a scroll, a part of which, with the word SPY on it, lay over on one side of the pedestal, on which the right arm of Liberty rested. The device on the right was, two infants making selections from a basket filled with flowers and bearing this motto: "THEY CULL THE CHOICEST." The imprint, "Boston: Printed and Published by Isaiah Thomas, in Union Street, near the Market, where Advertisements are taken in." The day of publication was Thursday. The majority of the customers for the former Spy preferred the way in which it had been published, and withdrew their subscriptions. On the appearance of this the subscribers did not amount to two hundred, but after the first week they increased daily, and in the course of two years the subscription list was larger than that of any other newspaper printed in New England. A number of gentlemen supplied this paper with political essays, which for the time were more particularly calculated for that class of citizens who had composed the great majority of its readers. For a few weeks some communications were furnished by those who were in favor of the royal prerogative, but they were exceeded by the writers on the other side; and the authors and subscribers among the tories denounced and quitted the Spy. The publisher then devoted it to the cause of his country, supported by the whigs, under whose banners he had enlisted. Writers of various classes, in the whig interest, furnished essays, which in a very considerable degree aided in preparing the public mind for events which followed. Common sense in common language is necessary to influence one class of citizens, as much as learning and elegance of composition are to produce an effect upon another. The cause of America was just, and it was only necessary to state this cause in a clear and impressive manner, to unite the American people in its support. Several attempts were made by the government of the province to prosecute the printer, but without effect. A piece in No. 37, under the signature of Mucius Scævola, more particularly excited an attempt of this nature, (see Appendix G). The printer had the further honor of being exhibited and burnt in effigy by the royalists of North Carolina, and he was threatened with having a coat of tar and feathers by a regiment of British soldiers, which paraded before his house.1 1 A soldier in one of the British regiments stationed in Boston, instigated by his officers, inveigled a countryman, one Thomas Ditson, jun., of Billerica, to purchase a musket. When the purchase was made, the officers appeared, and the countryman was taken into custody, under pretence of enticing the soldier to steal and sell the property of the king, &amp;c. The countryman was kept under guard during the night. Before daylight the next morning, after a sham trial in the barracks, he was stripped of his clothes, and coated from head to foot with tar and feathers; the soldiers then bound him in a chair to a truck, and before sunrise he was paraded by a regiment through the streets. The regiment, with the colonel at its head, halted before the Spy office, the music playing the Rogue's March; some of the soldiers vociferating "the printer of the Spy shall be the next to receive this punishment." This riot took place on the 10th of March, 1775. It occasioned great commotion among the citizens, and produced a well written and spirited remonstrance from the town of Billerica to the governor, Gage. In October, 1772, the addition of Thomas's Boston Journal was made to the title of the Spy; a political motto from Addison's Cato had been previously added.1 1 "Do thou, great Liberty, inspire our souls, And make our Lives in thy possession happy, Or our Deaths glorious in thy just defense." On the 7th of July, 1774, during the operation of the Boston port bill2 2 This act of the British government hastened the revolution. It was designed to punish Boston for destroying the tea sent over by the East India company, &amp;c. See the various histories of those times for an account of the pretexts which led the British ministry to lay the port of Boston under an interdict, &amp;c. so called, and just after the landing of four additional regiments of troops, with a train of royal artilery, a new political device appeared in the title of this paper—a snake and a dragon. The dragon represented Great Britain, and the snake the colonies. The snake was divided into nine parts, the head was one part, and under it N. E. as representing New England; the second part N. Y. for New York; the third N. J. for New Jersey; the fourth P. for Pennsylvania; the fifth M. for Maryland; the sixth V. for Virginia; the seventh N. C. for North Carolina; the eighth S. C. for South Carolina; and the ninth part, or tail, for Georgia. The head and tail of the snake were supplied with stings, for defence against the dragon, which appeared furious, and as bent on attacking the snake. Over the several parts of the snake was this motto, in large capitals, "JOIN OR DIE!" This device, which was extended under the whole width of the title of the Spy, appeared in every succeeding paper whilst it was printed in Boston. Its publication ceased in that town on the 6th of April, 1775, and on the 19th of that month hostilities between Great Britain and America commenced. A few days before this event took place, its publisher sent, privately, a press and types to Worcester; and, on the 3d of the following May, the publication of the Spy was resumed, and was the first printing done in that town. The title of the paper, of course, was again altered; it was now The Massachusetts Spy; or, American Oracle of Liberty; headed with "Americans! Liberty or Death! Join or Die!" The day of publication at Worcester was Wednesday. MAGAZINES, ETC. PRINTED IN BOSTON BEFORE THE REVOLUTION. The Boston Weekly Magazine. This production made its first appearance March 2, 1743, on a half sheet, octavo. No. 1 contained some extracts from the magazines published in London: a Poem to a political lady, an Ode by Mr. Addison, two short domestic articles of intelligence from the Boston newspapers, and the entries at the custom house for the week. The day of publication was Wednesday. It was continued only four weeks, and was printed by Rogers &amp; Fowle. The Christian History. No. 1 of this periodical work was published on Saturday, March 5th, 1743, on a large half sheet of fine medium in octavo, printed on a new small pica type. After the contents is a quotation from the Psalms: "That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works."—Psal. xxvi, 7. The imprint: "Boston, N. E. Printed by Kneeland &amp; Green, 1743, for Thomas Prince, Jun. A.B." The price was two shillings new tenor per quarter, and six pence more new tenor per Quarter covered, sealed, and directed." The editor and publisher was the son of the Reverend Thomas Prince, of Boston, author of The New England Chronology. The Christian History was regularly published, in numbers of eight pages each, every Saturday, for two years; each year making a volume, to which was prefixed a title page, and an index. The title page to the first volume reads thus: "The Christian History, containing Accounts of the Revival and propagation of Religion in Great Britain and America. For the year 1743." The editor gave the general contents as follows: "1. Authentic Accounts from Ministers, and other creditable Persons, of the Revival of Religion in the several Parts of New England. 2. Extracts of the most remarkable Pieces in the Weekly Histories of religion, and other accounts, printed both in England and Scotland. 3. Extracts of written Letters, both from England, Scotland, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia, of a Religious Nature, as they have been sent hither from creditable Persons and communicated to us. 4. Remarkable Passages, Historical and Doctrinal, out of the most famous old writers both of the Church of England and Scotland from the Reformation, as also the first Settlers of New-England and their Children; that we may see how far their pious Principles and Spirit are at this Day revived; and may guard against all Extreams." The American Magazine and Historical Chronicle. The first number of this Magazine, for September, 1743,1 1 It will be observed that this was twelve years after the appearance of the Gentleman's Magazine, still published in London.—M. was published on the 20th of the following October. It was printed on a fine medium paper in 8vo. Each number contained fifty pages; and was published, monthly, by "Samuel Eliot, in Cornhill, and Joshua Blanchard in Dock-Square," booksellers; and printed by Rogers &amp; Fowle, "in "Prison Lane," who were also concerned in the publication, and, after the first year, were sole proprietors of it. Jeremy Gridley, Esq., who had edited the Rehearsal, it has been said, was also the editor of this magazine. The following is an extract from the prospectus, viz: It will contain "1. A summary Rehearsal of the proceedings and debates in the British Parliament. 2. A View of the weekly and monthly Dissertations, Essays, &amp;c., selected from the publick Papers and Pamphlets published in London and the Plantations, viz: Political State, Transactions of the Royal Society, &amp;c., with Extracts from new Books. 3. Dissertations, Letters and Essays, moral, civil, political, humorous and polemical. 4. Select Pieces, relating to the Arts and Sciences. 5. Governour's Speeches, with the Proceedings of the Assembly, and an Abridgment of the Laws enacted in the respective Provinces and Colonies. 6. Poetical Essays on various Subjects. 7. Monthly Chronologer, containing an Account of the most remarkable Events, Foreign and Domestick. 8. Price Current. 9. Births and Deaths. 10. A Catalogue of New Books. The Magazine will be continued of the same Size, that so the Twelve Months may be bound in the same Volume at the Year's end with a compleat Index, which shall be added to the Month of December." This Magazine imitated The London Magazine in its appearance; a large cut of the town of Boston, in the title page, answered to a similar cut of the city of London in the title page of the London Magazine. Its pages were like those of that publication in size, two columus in a page, divided by the capital letters, A B C D E and F, at a distance from each other, and not by a line, or as printers term it, by rules. The imprint, "Boston: Printed by Rogers &amp; Fowle, and Sold by S. Eliot &amp; J. Blanchard, in Boston; B. Franklin, in Philadelphia; J. Parker, in NewYork; J. Pomroy, in New Haven; C. Campbell, Post-Master, New Port. Price Three Shillings, New Tenor, a Quarter," equal to half a dollar. It was well printed, on a long primer type, and was not inferior to the London and other magazines, then published in that city; but the extensive plan marked out in its prospectus could not be brought within the number of pages allowed to the work. In the general title page for the year, the before-mentioned view of the town of Boston, was impressed from a copperplate engraving; both the cut and the plate were as well executed as things of the kind generally were for the English magazines. This work was issued three years and four months, and then discontinued. It has no cuts or plates excepting those for the title pages. The New-England Magazine. This work is without date, either in the title, in the imprint, or in any of its numbers. No. 1 was published August 31, 1758. The title page is as follows: The NewEngland Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure. In the centre of the page is a small cut, the device a hand holding a bouquet, or bunch of flowers, with the motto, "Prodesse et Delectare e pluribus unum." One-half of this motto is on the left of the cut, and the other half on the right; underneath the device is this couplet: "Alluring Profit with Delight we blend, One out of many to the Publick send. "By various Authors. "Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles? Every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit. A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit." "Printed by Benjamin Mecom, and sold at his shop under the New-Printing-Office, near the Court-House, on Corn-hill in Boston. Each number of this Magazine contained sixty pages 12mo. Its publication was intended to have been monthly, but it came from the press irregularly, and was printed from types of various sizes. Some pieces were, both in prose and verse, on pica, and some on long primer; the pages were not in columns. Its contents were a collection of small fugitive pieces from magazines, newspapers, &amp;c. These were not arranged under general heads, excepting poetry, which was headed "Poetical Entertainment;" and we make one more exception for a head of "Queer Notions." The price was eight pence for each number. Mecom, the publisher of this Magazine, gave the following poetical description of its contents in an advertisement, viz: "Containing, and to contain, "Old fashioned writings and Select Essays, Queer Notions, Useful Hints, Extracts from plays; Relations Wonderful, and Psalm and Song, Good Sense, Wit, Humour, Morals, all ding dong; Poems and Speeches, Politicks and News What Some will like, and other Some refuse; Births, Deaths, and Dreams, and Apparitions too; With some Thing suited to each different Geû,1 1 Goût. To Humour Him, and Her, and Me, and You." This work found very few purchasers. Three or four numbers were published in the course of six or seven months, and it was then discontinued. The Censor. The Censor was altogether a political publication. The first number appeared November 23, 1771. It was printed in a small sheet, foolscap, folio, on an English type, by Ezekiel Russell, in Boston, and published on Saturdays. It made its appearance without any formal introduction. A dissertation in the Massachusetts Spy, under the signature of Mucius Scævola, probably occasioned the attempt to establish this paper. Mucius Scævola had attacked Governor Hutchinson with a boldness and severity before unknown in the political disputes of this country. The piece excited great warmth among those who supported the measures of the British administration, and they immediately commenced the publication of the Censor; in which the governor and the British administration were defended. Lieutenant Governor Oliver was the reputed author of several numbers of the Censor, under the signature of A Freeman, and these were thought to be better written than any other communications to that paper. Several other politicians were engaged as writers for the Censor,1 1 Dr. Benjamin Church, a reputed whig, who when the Revolutionary war commenced was appointed surgeon general of the American army, but was soon after arrested and confined, being detected in a traitorous correspondence with the British army in Boston, I have been informed by a very respectable person, whom I have long known, was a writer for the Censor. This person, then an apprentice to Russell, was employed to convey, in a secret manner, the doctor's manuscripts to the press, and proof sheets from the press to the doctor. but they gained no proselytes to their cause; and, although numbers of the first characters on the side of government came forward with literary and pecuinary aid, yet the circulation of the paper was confined to a few of their own party. As the Censor languished, its printer made an effort to convert it into a newspaper; and, with this view, some of its last numbers were accompanied with a separate half sheet, containing a few articles of news and some advertisements. But neither its writers nor its printer could give it a general circulation, and it was discontinued before the revolution of a year from its first publication. The Royal American Magazine. A Prospectus of this work appeared many months before the magazine; but the disordered state of public affairs, and the difficulties which individuals experienced from them, prevented it from being sooner put to press; and after a few numbers had been published, the distress occasioned to the inhabitants of Boston by shutting up and blockading their port, obliged its editor to suspend the publication. The first number for January, 1774, was published at the close of that month. It was printed on a large medium paper in octavo, on a new handsome type. Each number contained three sheets of letter press, and two copperplate engravings. The title was, The Royal American Magazine, or Universal Repository of Instruction and Amusement. The type metal cut in the title page, represented, by an aboriginal, America seated on the ground; at her feet lay a quiver, and near her a bow on which her right hand rested; in her left hand she held the calumet of peace, which she appeared to offer to the Genius of Knowledge standing before her dispensing instruction. Imprint, "Boston: Printed by and for Isaiah Thomas, near the Market." Then follow the names of several printers on the continent who sold the work. The editor, after having been at considerable trouble and expense in bringing the work before the public, published it six months, and then was obliged, first to suspend, and afterwards to relinquish it; but Joseph Greenleaf continued the publication until April following, when the war put a period to the magazine. This was the last periodical work established in Boston before the revolution. It had a considerable list of subscribers. SALEM. The Essex Gazette. Containing the freshest Advices, both Foreign and Domestick. This was the first newspaper printed in Salem. No. 1 was published August 2, 1768; and it was continued weekly, on Tuesday, crown size, folio, from small pica and brevier types. In the centre of the title was a cut, of which the design was taken from the official seal of the county. The principal figure a bird with its wings extended, and holding a sprig in its bill; perhaps intended to represent Noah's dove; and this device was far from being ill adapted to the state of our forefathers, who having been inhabitants of Europe, an old world, were become residents in America, to them a new one. Above the bird a fish, which seems to have been intended as a crest, emblematical of the codfishery, formerly the principal dependence of the county of Essex, of which Salem is a shire town. The whole supported by two aborigines, each holding a tomahawk, or battle axe. Imprint, "Salem: Printed by Samuel Hall, near the Town-House, Price 6s. 8d. per annum." It was afterwards "printed by Samuel and Ebenezer Hall." The Gazette was well conducted, and ably supported the cause of the country. In 1775, soon after the commencement of the war, the printers of this paper removed with their press to Cambridge, and there published the Gazette, or, as it was then entitled, The New England Chronicle: Or, the Essex Gazette. The junior partner died in 1775, and S. Hall became again the sole proprietor. When the British army left Boston Hall removed to the capital, and there printed The New England Chronicle, the words Essex Gazette being omitted. After publishing the paper a few years with this title, he sold his right to it, and the new proprietor entitled it The Independent Chronicle,1 1 This being the only allusion by Mr. Thomas to that paper, a portion of a letter from the late Mr. Nathaniel Willis referring to it, dated Boston, March 20, 1861, is quoted: "When I was an apprentice in the office of the Independent Chronicle, about 1796, I found in the garret enough of these papers to make a volume, which I arranged, had them bound, and have recently presented the volume to the Boston Public Library. From this it appears in their notices to the public, that Samuel Hall transferred the paper to Nathaniel Willis and Edward E. Powars, June 13, 1776; in December, 1779, N. Willis appears as sole publisher until 1784; it was then transferred to Adams &amp; Nourse, afterwards Adams &amp; Rhoades; and then my father went to Virginia. I was an apprentice in the Chronicle office from 1796 to 1803. Samuel Hall was a bookseller in the same store where Gould &amp; Lincoln so long remained, in Washington street." The Chronicle was united with the Boston Patriot in 1819, when its title ceased. For a full account of this paper, see Buckingham's Reminisences, 1, 248–87.—M. and began the alteration with No. 1. The Salem Gazette and Newbury and Marblehead Advertiser. A Weekly, Political, Commercial Paper—Influenced neither by Court or Country. This paper, the second published in the town, made its first appearance in June, 1774, printed on a crown sheet, folio, on an old long primer type, published weekly on Friday. Imprint, "Salem: Printed by E. Russell, at his New Printing-Office, in Ruck-street, near the State-House."1 1 Meaning court house. This Gazette was of short continuance; its circulation was confined to a few customers in Salem and the neighboring towns, which were inadequate to its support. The American Gazette: Or, The Constitutional Journal, Was first published June 18, 1776. It was published on Tuesday, printed on a crown sheet, folio. Imprint, "Salem: Printed by J. Rogers, at E. Russell's Printing-Office, Upper End of Main-Street," &amp;c. Russell was the conductor of this paper, Rogers being only his agent; it was published only a few weeks. In the head was a large cut, a coarse copy of that which then appeared in the title of the Pennsylvania Journal; the device, a ship and a book, or journal, &amp;c., as has already been described. It was several years after this newspaper was discontinued before the printing of another commenced in Salem. In January, 1781, Mary Crouch and company issued from their press The Salem Gazette and General Advertiser. This Gazette was printed only nine months, when Samuel Hall, who first published The Essex Gazette, returned to Salem, and, on the 18th of October, 1781, established The Salem Gazette, afterwards printed by T. Cushing.2 2 In 1837, the editor of the Gazette stated that 49 other papers had been started in Salem since the Gazette, of which 46 had broken up in bankruptcy. Samuel Dodge died at Rowley, Mass., June 17, 1860, aged 82, who had taken and paid for the Salem Register sixty years.—M. [See List of Newspapers printed in the United States in January, 1810.] NEWBURYPORT. No attempt was made to establish a newspaper in that place until the year 1773. The Essex Journal, and Merimack Packet: Or, the Massachusetts and New-Hampshire General Advertiser, Was issued from the press, December 4, 1773, by Isaiah Thomas, printed on a crown sheet, folio, equal in size to most of the papers then published in Boston. At first its day of publication was Saturday; afterwards, Wednesday. Two cuts were in the title; one, the left, representing the arms of the province, that on the right, a ship under sail. Imprint, "Newbury-Port: Printed by Isaiah Thomas &amp; Henry Walter-Tinges, in King-Street, opposite to the Rev. Mr. Parsons's Meeting-House," &amp;c. Thomas was the proprietor of the Journal; he lived in Boston, and there published the Massachusetts Spy. Tinges, as a partner in the Journal, managed the concerns of it. Before the full expiration of a year Thomas sold his right in this paper to Ezra Lunt, and, about two years after, Lunt sold to John Mycall. Tinges was a partner to both; but to the latter only for about six months, when the partnership was dissolved, and Mycall became the proprietor and sole publisher of The Essex Journal, the publication of which he continued many years. WORCESTER. The Massachusetts Spy: Or, American Oracle of Liberty. The printer of the Massachusetts Spy, or Boston Journal, was obliged to leave Boston, as has been mentioned, on account of the commencement of hostilities between the colonies and the parent country. He settled in this place, and on the 3d of May, 1775, recommenced the publication of that paper, which he continued until the British troops evacuated Boston, when he leased it for one year to William Stearns and Daniel Bigelow. They adopted another motto: "Undaunted by Tyrants, we will die, or be free." After the first lease expired, the paper was leased for another year to Anthony Haswell, printed. Owing to unskillful workmen, bad ink, wretched paper, and worn down types, the Spy appeared in a miserable dèshabillè during the two years for which it had been leased, and for two years after. At the end of that term, the proprietor returned to Worcester, and resumed its publication, with a new motto: "Unanimity at Home, and Bravery and Perseverance in the Field, will secure the Independence of America." Good materials of the kinds just mentioned could not be immediately procured, and the Spy from necessity was continued under numerous disadvantages until 1781, when it was printed from a good type, on better paper, with new devices and an engraved title. The device on the left was a figure representing America, an Indian holding the cap of Liberty on a staff with the left hand, and in the right a spear, aimed at the British lion, which appeared in the act of attacking her from an opposite shore. Round the device was "LIBERTY DEFENDED FROM TYRANNY." That on the right was a chain of thirteen links, with a star in each link, representing the union of the thirteen states. This chain was placed in a circular form, leaving an opening for the arms of France, to which the ends of the chain were attached, and which perfected the circle. Above the arms were two hands clasped, and directly over them a sword, with its hilt resting on the clasped hands; the motto, "UNION." The title was thus new modelled, Thomas's Masschusetts Spy; or the Worcester Gazette. Motto: "The noble Efforts of a Virtuous, Free and United People, shall extirpate Tyranny, and establish Liberty and Peace." At the conclusion of the war the Spy was enlarged, and each page contained five columns. It was printed from new types; and the motto was changed to "Noscere res humanas est Hominis. Knowledge of the word is necessary for every man." About that time, its editor began to publish, in the paper, as room would permit, Robertson's History of America, and completed the whole in about one year.1 1 The English edition of Robertson's History, in three volumes, 8vo, then sold for six dollars. The price of the Spy was only nine shillings per annum. This was followed by a history of the revolutionary war. Besides these, the Spy contained valuable, useful, and entertaining extracts, on various subjects, from European and American publications, as well as original essays.2 2 The Worcester Speculator, inserted in the Spy, in numbers, weekly, was furnished by a society of gentlemen in the country of Worcester. A selection from these numbers, all the composition of the late Reverend Doctor Fiske of Brookfield, together with some other pieces by that gentleman, was afterwards printed in two duodecimo volumes, entitled The Moral Monitor. This paper was printed with continued improvements until March, 1786, when the publication was, on the following account, suspended. The legislature of Massachusetts had in March, 1785, passed an "act, imposing duties on licensed vellum, parchment and paper." This act laid a duty of two-thirds of a penny on newspapers, and a penny on almanacs, which were to be stamped. The British stamp act of 1765, violently opposed in the colonies, rendered this act so unpopular from its very name, that the legislature was induced to repeal it before it went into operation. But, in the July following, another act was passed, which imposed a duty on all advertisements inserted in the newspapers printed in this commonwealth. This act was thought by the publisher of the Spy, and by many others, to lay an improper restraint on the press. He therefore discontinued the Spy during the period that this act was in force, which was two years. But he published as a substitute a periodical work, entitled The Worcester Weekly Magazine, in octavo. The restoration of the Spy took place in April, 1788, and a motto was at that time introduced from the constitution of Massachusetts, viz.: "The Liberty of the Press is essential to the security of freedom." In 1801, Thomas resigned the printing and publishing of the Spy to his son Isaiah Thomas, Jr. The Spy is the oldest newspaper in Massachusetts.1 1 In 1843, there were 79 newspapers published in Massachusetts, and the Spy, although it had met with some interruptions, was still recognized as the oldest paper in the state. In 1845, it began to be published daily; and now, in 1872, is one of the most flourishing papers in the country. There are now (1872), about 175 newspapers and other periodicals published in Boston alone.—M. In 1785, a neat, small paper, was published semi-weekly in Charlestown, Massachusetts, entitled The American Recorder and Charlestown Advertiser. It was printed about three years by Allen &amp; Cushing, and then discontinued. I mention this, because it was the only newspaper issued from a press in the county of Middlesex.</field>

And considering it is impossible for half a Sheet of Paper to contain all the Remarkable News that may happen to be brought in upon the Arrival of Ships from England or other extraordinary Occurrences; the Publisher therefore proposes in all such Cases, to Print a Sheet of what he judges most Material, and shall continue to send the Paper to all such as have hitherto taken it, until he is advised to the contrary by those determined to drop it, which he hopes will not be many.

      <field name="fulltext">RHODE ISLAND. Although the press had been established many years in Connecticut before it was introduced into Rhode Island, yet a newspaper was published in Rhode Island twenty years earlier than in Connecticut. NEWPORT. This town was the fourth in New England where a press was established, and the second from which a newspaper was issued. [No. 1.] THE Rhode-Island Gazette. This was the first paper issued in the colony. No. 1 was published September 27, 1732, printed on a small sheet of pot size, from a pica type much worn. Its contents were generally comprised on half a sheet. The day of publication was Wednesday. Imprint, "Newport, Rhode-Island: Printed and Sold by James Franklin, at his Printing-House under the Town-School-House, where Advertisements and Letters to the Author are taken in." The Gazette was discontinued the 24th of May, 1733, seven months from its first appearance.1 1 This would be eight months; but it does not seem to have been regularly published; No. 17 is dated Jan. 25, No. 19 Feb. 22, No. 20 March 1.—M. Some attempts were made to revive this paper by Franklin's widow, but without success.1 1 The press used by the Franklins was preserved in the office of the Mercury to a late period, and an effort was made to sell it for $100 by the administrator of the Barbers; but the claim that it was the press on which Benjamin Franklin wrought, could not be verified, and it remained unsold in a worm-eaten and disabled condition in 1858.—M. The Newport Mercury, First published about September, 1758,2 2 The first number appeared June 12.—M. gained a permanent establishment. It was printed on Mondays by James Franklin, son of the printer of The Rhode Island Gazette, generally on paper of crown size, folio, but usually consisting of half a sheet only. When the publisher died, in August, 1762, the Mercury was continued by his mother, Anne Franklin, until she went into partnership with Samuel Hall, under the firm of Franklin &amp; Hall, in Thames street. Mrs. Franklin died in April, 1763. Hall then became the proprietor of the Mercury, and published it until 1768. Under the management of Hall, the Mercury made a more respectable appearance than before. It was printed handsomely and correctly; its columns were filled with Well selected intelligence from the papers printed in the neighboring colonies, and due attention was paid to domestic information. Advertising customers increased, and its circulation became more extensive. In 1768, Hall resigned the Mercury to Solomon Southwick, who conducted it until several years subsequent to the revolution. During the war, while the British troops possessed Newport, Southwick set up a press at Attleborough, Massachusetts, and there published the Mercury. He returned to Newport as soon as that town was evacuated, and reestablished his press.1 1 It is stated (Hist. Mag., IV, 87), that the British plundered his office of £200. Another report (Newport Mercury, Sept. 12, 1858), states that before leaving the island, Southwick buried his press and types in the garden in the rear of the old Kilburn House, in Broad street; that a tory, having knowledge of the fact, gave the enemy information, and they were dug up, and used by the British during their stay, and that copies of a paper published by them are preserved in the Redwod Library.—M. This paper, when first published, had a large cut of the figure of Mercury in its title. Hall exchanged it for a small king's arms. Southwick enlarged the king's arms, and added to the title: "Containing the freshest advices," &amp;c. His printing house was" in Queen Street, near the Middle of the Parade." Southwick continued the Mercury on the respectable ground on which it was placed by Hall; and, during the contest for the independence of our country, he conducted it with firmness and patriotic zeal. Southwick's successors have continued the Mercury to this time (1810). It is the fourth oldest paper now published in the United States.2 2 Henry Barber, who published the Mercury in 1780, learned printing of Southwick. The family emigrated from England, and settled in Westerly, K. I. He died Sept. 11, 1800, and was succeeded by his sons, William and John H.; they were finally succeeded by William Lee Barber, the son of John H., who died Dec. 27, 1850, aged 25, and the paper, which had been published by them almost uninterruptedly during seventy years, passed out of the family. It is still continued, and is the oldest paper in the country except the New Hampshire Gazette, which is two years its senior. See vol. 1, pp. 199–201.—M. The following item is clipped from the Boston Daily Advertiser of Nov. 15, 1872: "The Newport Mercury was sold to-day to John P. Sanborn, who for two years past has been the editor of the Daily News of this city. F. A. Pratt, the former owner of the Mercury, has been connected with it for thirty years, and from its columns has reaped a profitable harvest with which he will retire from the journalistic field. It is rumored that the day is not far distant when the Mercury will be issued as a morning daily."—H. PROVIDENCE. The Providence Gazette, and Country Journal. Containing the freshest Advices, both Foreign and Domestick. This was the only newspaper printed in Providence before 1775. It was first published October 20, 1762, by William Goddard, on a sheet of crown size, folio; a cut of the king's arms decorated the title. It was printed every Saturday, from types of english and long primer. Imprint, "Providence: Printed by William Goddard, at the Printing-Office near the Great Bridge, where Subscriptions, Advertisements and Letters of Intelligence, &amp;c., are received for this Paper; and where all Manner of printing Work is performed with care and Expedition." The Gazette was discontinued from May 11, to August 24, 1765. On that day a paper was published, headed Vox Populi, Vox Dei. A Providence Gazette Extraordinary, Printed by S. and W. Goddard." After this it was, till January, 1767, "Printed by Sarah Goddard and Co." It then appeared with this imprint: "Printed (in the Absence of William Goddard) by Sarah Goddard &amp; Co." In a short time after this, it was published by Sarah Goddard and John Carter. In 1769, William and Sarah Goddard resigned their right in the Gazette to John Carter, who has published it from that time to the present (1810). This paper zealously defended the rights of the colonies before the revolution, ably supported the cause of the country during the war, and has weekly diffused federal republican principles since the establishment of independence. The Gazette has, from time to time, been supplied by various writers, with many well composed political, moral and entertaining essays. Its weekly collection of intelligence is judiciously selected, and it was correctly and regularly printed more than forty years by its respectable publisher, John Carter. [See Newburyport, Philadelphia, Baltimore.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONNECTICUT. Newspapers were not printed in this colony until 1755, and till this period there had been but one printing house established in Connecticut. The war with the French at this time, in which the British colonies were deeply interested, increased the demand for public journals, and occasioned the publication of one in Connecticut. Before the commencement of the revolutionary war, four newspapers were published in this colony. NEW HAVEN. The Connecticut Gazette. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. This paper made its appearance January 1, 1755. It was printed on a half sheet of foolscap, in quarto; but occasionally on a whole sheet of pot, folio, by James Parker &amp; Company; and was published weekly, on Friday. John Holt was the editor, and the junior partner of the firm; he conducted the Journal till 1760, when he removed to New York, and Thomas Green was employed by the company to conduct the Gazette. By the establishment of postriders to the seat of the war at the northward, and to several parts of the colony, the Gazette had, for that time, a considerable circulation. The publication was continued by Parker &amp; Company till 1764, when it was for a short time suspended, but afterwards revived by Benjamin Mecom. Mecom continued the Gazette, and added a cut to the title—one which he had used in the title page of The New England Magazine, published by him three or four months in Boston. The device was a hand clasping a bunch of flowers. He afterwards exchanged this for another, which represented a globe placed on the head of a seraph, an eagle with extended wings lighting with one claw on the globe, holding in the other a book encircled by a glory; from the book was suspended a pair of dividers. Motto, "Honor Virtue Paratur." Another motto, extending the whole width of the page, was added after the title, viz: "Those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." Imprint, "Printed by Benjamin Mecom, at the Post-Office in New-Haven." There were two columns in a page of this paper, which was printed from long primer and pica types. Holt, and Mecom his successor, appear to have been attentive in making selections for the Gazette, which was sometimes supplied with original essays on various subjects. It was discontinued in 1767. The Connecticut Journal and New-Haven Post-Boy. This paper was first published in October, 1767, soon after the Gazette was discontinued. It was printed on a pot sheet, folio, three columns in a page; types, long primer and pica. A cut of a postman on horseback, copied from The Boston Post-Boy, but badly engraved, divided the title. It was published weekly, on Friday. Imprint, generally, "Printed by Thomas and Samuel Green, near the College." Some years after, the title was Connecticut Journal only, the cut omitted, and the size of the paper enlarged to a crown sheet; but it was occasionally varied. The Journal gained an establishment, and maintained its ground against several other papers which have from time to time appeared in New Haven. It continued to be published by Thomas and Samuel Green, until February, 1799; Samuel then died, and the Journal was continued till January, 1809, by Thomas Green &amp; Son.1 1 Samuel Green died at New Haven, Feb., 1799, aged 46. His brother Thomas died there also, May, 1812, aged 77. Thomas, Jr., died in May, 1825, aged 60.—M. It has lately (1810) been enlarged to a sheet of royal, and the title altered to The Connecticut Journal and Advertiser. In January, 1809, it was printed by Thomas Green &amp; Co.2 2 The company were Thomas Green, jun., and Thomas Collier. Collier served his apprenticeship with his uncle Richard Draper, at Boston, and was the publisher of a newspaper at Litchfield, in 1785, entitled, The Weekly Monitor and American Advertiser. In July of the same year, Thomas Green retiring from business, the new firm was dissolved, and the Journal published, on Thursdays, "by Eli Hudson,3 3 In 1819 it would seem that Hudson had passed the Journal to other hands, as he was in that year a journeyman in the office of the Connecticut Herald. He was inefficient and dissipated. The Journal was published until about 1834, by Newton &amp; Peck, on whose hands it died, or was merged in another concern.—M. successor to T. Green &amp; Co." NEW LONDON. The New-London Summary. The Summary was the second newspaper established in that colony, and was first published August 8, 1758, by the second Timothy Green. It was printed on a small half sheet, and occasionally on a whole sheet, weekly; at first on Tuesday, and afterwards on Friday. A small cut of the colony arms was in the title. Green continued the Summary until his death, which happened in October, 1763, and three weeks after his demise it was discontinued.1 1 We learn from Miss Caulkins, that it was entitled The New London Summary, or the Weekly Advertiser, with the Freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestic. The colophon was, Printed by Thomas Green. It was a folio sheet; the size of the page 8 × 12 inches, in two columns. A cut of the colony seal, surmounted by an escutcheon of the town, a ship under full sail, by way of crest. No. 1 was issued Aug. 8, 1758; the editor died Aug. 3, 1763, and the paper was discontinued.—M. The New-London Gazette. With the latest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. This Gazette was substituted for the Summary, which it immediately succeeded. It had a cut of the king's arms in the title, and was first published November 1, 1763,2 2 After the peace of Paris, in 1763, the trade of New London revived, and the Gazette was printed on the 3d Nov. (Hist. New Lond., ed. 1860, p. 478). The size was considerably increased, the print arranged in three columns, and the price 3s. per annum. It changed owners often, the last Green surrendering it in 1841, and in 1844 it was discontinued, after an existence of more then 80 years. See Caulkins's Hist. New London, ed. 1860, p. 654–5.—M. by Timothy Green, the third printer of this name in New London. This paper was issued weekly, on Friday, on a sheet of foolscap, folio, principally from a long primer type. On the 17th of December, 1773, the title was altered to The Connecticut Gazette. It was enlarged to a sheet of crown, and afterwards to a sheet of larger size. This paper outlived several which, since 1775, were published in the same place; it uniformly defended the rights of the country before our revolution, and supported federal republican principles after the adoption of the constitution.3 3 In 1797, Charles Holt began to publish a paper in New London, called The Bee. So fully did the Greens possess the ground, that it was seriously inquired of Mr. Holt if he had obtained permission of them to publish a paper there. Holt removed to Hudson, N. Y., in 1802.—M. Timothy Green, the first printer of the Gazette, in May, 1793, resigned his right in the paper to his son, Samuel Green, who continued its publication. HARTFORD. The Connecticut Courant. This was the third newspaper established in the colony. It was first published in December, 1764,1 1 A fac-simile of the first Courant was published, in 1864, which is dated Monday, October 29, 1764. It appears to have been a prospectus number, unknown to Mr. Thomas. It was issued as Number 00, and is dated "Hartford: Printed by Thomas Green, at the Heart and Crown, near the North Meeting House." The following is the editor's address: "Hartford, October 29th, 1764." "Of all the Arts which have been introduc'd amongst Mankind, for the civilizing Human-Nature, and rendering Life agreeable and happy, none appear of greater Advantage than that of Printing: for hereby the greatest Genius's of all Ages, and Nations, live and speak for the Benefit of future Generations.—Was it not for the Press, we should be left almost intirely ignorant of all those noble Sentiments which the Antients were endow'd with. By this Art, Men are brought acquainted with each other, though never so remote, as to Age or Situation; it lays open to View, the Manners, Genius and Policy of all Nations and Countries and faithfully transmits them to Posterity.—But not to insist upon the Usefulness of this Art in general, which must be obvious to every One, whose Thoughts are the least extensive. The Benefit of a Weekly Paper, must in particular have its Advantages, as it is the Channel which conveys the History of the present Times to every Part of the World. The Articles of News from the different Papers (which we shall receive every Saturday, from the neighboring Provinces) that shall appear to us, to be most authentic and interesting shall always be carefully inserted; and great Care will be taken to collect from Time to Time all domestic Occurrences, that are worthy the Notice of the Publick; for which, we shall always be obliged to any of our Correspondents, within whose Knowledge they may happen. The CONNECTICUT COURANT, (a Specimen of which, the Publick are now presented with) will, on due Encouragement be continued every Monday, beginning on Monday, the 19th of November, next: Which Encouragement we hope to deserve, by a constant Endeavour to render this Paper, useful and entertaining, not only as a Channel for News, but assisting to all Those who may have Occasion to make use of it as an Advertiser." This paper is still (1872) in successful career, being published daily, and weekly; the latter issue is stated at 9000 copies.—M. by Thomas Green, on a sheet of pot size, and continued, weekly on Tuesday, until 1767. Green then took as a partner Ebenezer Watson, and removed to New Haven. Watson managed the Courant for two years, under the firm name of Green &amp; Watson, after which Watson became its proprietor. The paper was for a number of years printed with a much worn long primer type, occasionally intermixed with columns and half columns of old pica. About the year 1773, it was enlarged to a crown sheet; a coarse cut of the king's arms was inserted in the title, to which was added, "Containing the freshest and most important Advices, both Foreign and Domestic." The Courant was afterwards printed on a new type, when it made a more respectable appearance. The king's arms were discarded, and the arms of Connecticut took their place in the title, which was now altered to The Connecticut Courant and Hartford Weekly Intelligencer: Containing, &amp;c. Imprint: "Printed and published by Ebenezer Watson, near the Great-Bridge." After the British troops gained possession of New York, and the newspapers on the side of the country in that place were discontinued, and the printers of them dispersed, the Courant became of much consequence; its circulation rapidly increased; and, for some time, the number of copies printed weekly was equal to, if not greater, than that of any other paper then printed on the continent. Watson, the publisher, died in September, 1777, and the Courant was continued by his widow and George Goodwin, under the firm of Watson &amp; Goodwin, until March, 1779. Barzillai Hudson1 1 Mr. Hudson died July 31, 1823, aged 82; at which time he was the senior proprietor of the Courant.—M. married the widow of Watson, and became the partner of Goodwin in March, 1779; and, from that time to the present (1810), the Courant has been published by the well established firm of Hudson &amp; Goodwin;1 1 Mr. Goodwin was yet hale and active when I knew him in Hartford, in 1829, and for more than twelve years afterwards, was still in the habit, although no longer a partner in the concern, of walking to the printing office daily, and setting up paragraphs in type, to gratify long established habit. He died May 14, 1844, aged 88. In 1842, an old gentleman called at the office of the Courant, who stated that he was in his 86th year, and that he had been a subscriber to the paper sixty-five years.—M. the latter of whom has the management of the press.2 2 The Courant is still published at Hartford, by Hawley, Goodrich &amp; Co.—H. From the commencement of the war, in 1775, many respectable writers occasionally furnished this paper with political essays in favor of measures adopted by the country in the time of the great contest; and in defence of those since pursued by the federal administration. NORWICH. The Norwich Packet. And, the Connecticut, Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, and Rhode Island Weekly Advertiser. The publication of the Packet began in October, 1773. It was handsomely printed with a new long primer type, on a sheet of crown paper, weekly, on Thursday.3 3 Caulkins's History of Norwich, pp. 357–64, gives a fac-simile of the head of this paper, and an extended account of it and its publishers. See also The Norwich Jubilee, p. 292, for a historical sketch of printers and printing in that place.—M. "Norwich Packet" was engraved in large German text, and the title was divided by a large cut of a ship under sail. Imprint, "Norwich: Printed by Alexander Robertson, James Robertson &amp; John Trumbull, at the Printing-Office near the Court-House, at Six Shillings and Eight Pence per Annum. Advertisements, &amp;c., are thankfully received for this Paper, and all Manner of Printing Work is performed with Care, Fidelity, and Expedition." The packet was continued by this company until June, 1776; Trumbull then became the sole publisher, and continued it with various alterations in the title, size, and appearance, until he died, in 1802. After his decease, it was printed for his widow, Lucy Trumbull, but under a new title, viz: The Connecticut Centinel. The Centinel in fact was a new paper, established on the foundation of the Packet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEW HAMPSHIRE. No newspaper was printed in this colony until the year 1756. PORTSMOUTH. A press having been established in Portsmouth by Daniel Fowle from Boston, he in August, 1756,1 1 On the 6th of October, 1856, a centennial anniversary of the first newspaper in New Hampshire was held at Portsmouth, for which occasion a facsimile of the first number of the Gazette was printed. It appears by that, that the date was Thursday, October 7. It is possible that a prospectus number was issued in August, as was the case with the Newport Mercury. Although the anniversary of the establishment of the Gazette was celebrated with great spirit and eclat in 1856, the paper was discontinued in 1861, for about two years, when it was revived and published with eminent success. Abner Greenleaf, who had printed and edited the Gazette, died Sept. 28, 1868, aged 83. An almanac was also printed at this office in 1756 for the ensuing year.—M. began the publication of a public journal, entitled Numb. 1. Friday, August, 1756. THE New-Hampshire GAZETTE. Crow and the Fox. Containing the Freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. It was first printed from a long primer type, on half a sheet foolscap, in quarto; but was soon enlarged to half a sheet crown, folio; and it sometimes appeared on a whole sheet crown. Imprint, "Portsmouth, in New Hampshire, Printed by Daniel Fowle, where this Paper may be had at one Dollar per Annum; or Equivalent in Bills of Credit, computing a Dollar this year at Four Pounds Old Tenor." Fowle had several type metal cuts, which had been engraved and used for an abridgment of Croxall's Esop; and as he thought that there should be something ornamental in the title of the Gazette, and not finding an artist to engrave any thing appropriate, he introduced one of these cuts, designed for the fable of the crow and the fox. This cut was, in a short time, broken by some accident, and he supplied its place by one engraved for the fable of Jupiter and the peacock. This was used until worn down, when another cut from the fables was substituted. Eventually, the royal arms, badly engraved, appeared; and at the same time, "Historical Chronicle" was added to the title; a cut of the king's arms well executed, afterwards took the place of the other. In September, 1764, Robert Fowle became the partner of Daniel in the publication of the Gazette, and in 1774 they separated. In 1775, there was a little irregularity in the publication of the paper, occasioned by the war; but D. Fowle in a short time continued it as usual. The Gazette was not remarkable in its political features; but its general complexion was favorable to the cause of the country. In May, 1776, Benjamin Dearborne, to whom Fowle taught printing, became the publisher of this paper, and altered its title to, The Freeman's Journal, or New-Hampshire Gazette. Dearborne continued the paper a few years, after which it was again published by Fowle, who made several alterations in the title. In 1785, Fowle relinquished it to Melchor &amp; Osborne, who published it for a number of years; and it is, at the present time (1810), issued from the press of their successors with its original title. The New-Hampshire Gazette is the oldest newspaper printed in New England; and only two of those which preceded it are now published in the United States.1 1 This paper is now, 1872, the weekly issue of the Portsmouth Chronicle published daily on a sheet of eight pages.—M. The Portsmouth Mercury and Weekly Advertiser. Containing the freshest and most important Advices, both Foreign and Domestick. This was the second newspaper published in New Hampshire. Its first appearance was on the 21st of January, 1765. It was introduced with an address to the public, which states that, "The Publisher proposes to print Nothing that may have the least Tendency to subvert good Order in publick or private Societies, and to steer clear of litigious, ill natured and trifling Disputes in Individuals; yet, neither opposition, arbitrary Power, or publick Injuries may be expected to be screen'd from the Knowledge of the People, whose Liberties are dearer to them than their lives." The Mercury was published weekly, on Monday, on a crown sheet, folio, from a new large faced small pica from Cottrell's foundry in London.2 2 Not celebrated for producing the best types. Imprint, "Portsmouth, in New-Hampshire, Printed by Thomas Furber at the New Printing-Office near the Parade, where this Paper may be had for one Dollar or Six Pounds O. T. per year; One Half to be paid at Entrance." The Mercury a few weeks after its first appearance was very irregular as to its size. It was most commonly comprised in a sheet of pot or foolscap, printed broadsides, but occasionally on half a sheet of medium or demy, according as paper could be purchased at the stores the moment it was wanted. The typography of the Mercury, the new type excepted, did not exceed that of the Gazette. The collection of intelligence was inferior; and this paper was not more supported by any number of respectable writers than the Gazette. Before the first year of the publication of the Mercury ended, Furber took as a partner Ezekiel Russell, and his name appeared after Furber's in the imprint. They who in the greatest degree encouraged the Mercury, very warmly opposed the stamp act, laid on the colonies at this time by the British parliament; indeed, the spirit of the country rose in opposition to this act; and, although some publishers of newspapers made a faint stand, yet few among those more immediately attached to the British administration, were hardy enough to afford the measure even a feeble support. The New Hampshire Gazette, which some thought would not appear in opposition to the stamp act, came forward against it; and, on the day preceding that on which it was designed the act should take place, appeared in full mourning, contained some very spirited observations against this measure of government, and continued to be published as usual without stamps. The Mercury did not gain that circulation which it might have obtained had its editors taken a more decided part, and either defended government with energy, or made the paper generally interesting to the public by a zealous support of the rights and liberties of the colonies. In consequence of the neglect of the publishers to render the Mercury worthy of public attention, the customers withdrew, and the paper, after having been published about three years, was discontinued. From this time to the commencement of the war, the Gazette was the only newspaper published in the province of New Hampshire. EXETER. The third newspaper which appeared in New Hampshire, was issued from the press in Exeter, near the close of the year 1775, and published, irregularly, by Robert Fowle, under various titles, in 1776 and part of 1777, until discontinued. It was printed on a large type, small paper, and often on half a sheet. It was first entitled, A New Hampshire Gazette, afterwards The New Hampshire Gazette; The New Hampshire Gazette, or Exeter Morning Chronicle; The New Hampshire [State] Gazette, or, Exeter Circulating Morning Chronicle; The State Journal, or The New Hampshire Gazette and Tuesday's Liberty Advertiser. These and other alterations, with changes of the day of publication, took place within one year. It was published, generally, without an imprint. In the last alteration of the title, a large cut, coarsely engraved, was introduced; it was a copy of that which had for several years been used in The Pennsylvania Journal,1 1 See account of The Pennsylvania Journal, Salem Gazette, &amp;c. and the same which Rogers, some time before, had introduced into the Salem Gazette and Advertiser. Several other newspapers since 1777, have had a beginning and ending in Exeter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEW YORK. When treating of the introduction of printing into New York, I should have mentioned, that in 1668, Governor Lovelace was desirous of having a press established in that province; and it appears by a record made at the time, that he sent to Boston to procure a printer, but did not succeed in his application. In 1686, among other articles of instruction sent by King James to Governor Dongan, one was, that he should "allow no printing press in the province." And, consequently, the pamphlets which appeared in the famous dispute respecting the unfortunate colonel Leisler, in 1689 and 1690, are supposed to have been printed in Boston. See Appendix H. NEW YORK. The first newspaper published in the city was printed by William Bradford. It made its appearance October 16, 1725, and was entited, Numb. 2. THE New-York Gazette. From Monday Oct. 16, to Oct. 23, 1725. Newyork Arms. Post-Man. This paper was published weekly, on Monday. I have a few numbers of this Gazette, published in 1736. They are printed on a foolscap sheet, from a type of the size of english, much worn. In the title are two cuts, badly executed; the one on the left is the arms of New York, supported by an Indian on each side; the crest is a crown. The cut on the right is a postman, on an animal somewhat resembling a horse, on full speed. The imprint, "Printed and Sold by William Bradford, in New York. Bradford was near seventy years of age when he began the publication of the Gazette; he continued to publish it about sixteen years, and then retired from business. James Parker began The New York Gazette anew in January, 1742–3. Numb. 1. THE New-York Weekly JOURNAL. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. MUNDAY, October 5, 1733.1 1 Zenger, by some mistake, dated his first paper October 5, 1733, instead of November 5. In the account of his trial, he mentions that he began the Journal Nov. 5, 1738, and so it appears from the numbers. No. 2 is dated November 12, 1733.—Munday, was so spelled by Zenger, and others at that time. This was the second newspaper established in the province; it made its appearance November 5. 1733. The Journal was of the small size usually printed at that time, that is foolscap; generally a whole sheet, printed chiefly on pica. It was published every "Munday." Imprint, "New York: Printed and Sold by John Peter Zenger: By whom Subscriptions for this Paper are taken in at Three Shillings per Quarter." The Journal was established for a political purpose. For three years it was in a state of warfare with the administration of Governor Crosby, and his successor Lieutenant Governor Clarke. It was supposed to be published under the patronage of the Honorable Rip Van Dam, who had been president of the council, and opposed the governor and his successor. The New York Gazette, printed by Bradford, was then under the control of the governor. Newspapers were not at that time burthened with advertisements. I have seen several numbers printed after the paper had been established seven or eight years, with only one or two advertisements. It was well printed. Zenger appears to have understood his business, and to have been a scholar, but he was not correct in the English language, especially in orthography. On Sunday, the 17th of November, 1734, Zenger was arrested and imprisoned by virtue of a warrant from the governor and council, "for printing and publishing several seditious libels," in the New York Weekly Journal, viz: in Numbers 7, 47, 48 and 49. The governor and council by message requested the concurrence of the house of representatives in prosecuting Zenger, and a committee of conference on the subject was chosen by the house and by the council. The house finally ordered the request of the governor and council to lie on the table, and would not concur. The governor and council then ordered the mayor and magistrates, at their quarter session in November, 1734, to attend to the "burning by the common hangman, or whipper, near the pillory, the libellous papers." The mayor's court would not attend to the order; the papers were therefore burnt by the order of the governor, not by the hangman or whipper, who were officers of the corporation, but by the sheriff's servant. At the next term of the supreme court, the grand jury found the presentment against Zenger ignoramus. The attorney general was then directed to file an information against him for printing the said libels, and he remained in prison until another term. His counsel offered exceptions to the commissions of the judges, and prayed to have them filed. The judges would not allow, or even hear the exceptions, and they excluded Zenger's counsel, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Smith, from the bar. Zenger obtained other counsel, viz: Mr. John Chambers, of New York, and Andrew Hamilton, Esq., of Philadelphia. Mr. Hamilton made the journey from Philadelphia, to New York for the sole purpose of defending Zenger. Zenger being put to trial pleaded not guilty. The printing and publishing the papers were acknowledged by Zenger's counsel, who offered to give the truth in evidence. This the court would not admit. Mr. Hamilton argued the cause in a most able manner, before the court and a numerous and respectable assemblage of people. The judges observed, that the jury might find that Zenger printed and published the papers in question, and leave it to the court to determine whether they were libellous. Mr. Hamilton remarked, that they might do so, but they had a right, beyond all dispute, to judge of the law as well as the fact, &amp;c. The jury having retired a short time, returned with a verdict, not guilty, to the great mortification of the court, and of all Zenger's prosecutors; but which was received by the audience with loud bursts of applause, concluding with three cheers. The next day Zenger was released from prison, after having been confined eight months. At the common council of the city of New York, holden on the 29th of September following, the mayor, aldermen and assistants, presented Mr. Hamilton with the freedom of the city, and the thanks of the corporation expressed in the following manner. "City of New York, ss.: Paul Richards, Esq., Mayor, the Recorder, Aldermen, and Assistants of the City of New York, convened in Common Council, to all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting. Whereas, Honour is the just Reward of Virtue, and publick Benefits demand a publick Acknowledgment. We therefore, under a grateful Sense of the remarkable Service done to the Inhabitants of this City and Colony, by Andrew Hamilton, Esq; of Pennsylvania, Barrister at Law, by his learned and generous Defence of the Rights of Mankind and the Liberty of the Press, in the Case of John-Peter Zenger, lately tried on an Information exhibited in the Supreme Court of this Colony, do by these Presents, bear to the said Andrew Hamilton, Esq; the publick Thanks of the Freemen of this Corporation for that signal Service, which he cheerfully undertook under great Indisposition of Body, and generously performed, refusing any Fee or Reward; and in Testimony of our great Esteem for his Person, and Sense of his Merit, do hereby present him with the Freedom of this Corporation. These are, therefore, to certify and declare, that the said Andrew Hamilton, Esq; is hereby admitted and received and allowed a Freeman and Citizen of said City; To Have, Hold, Enjoy and Partake of all the Benefits, Liberties, Privileges, Freedoms and Immunities whatsoever granted or belonging to a Freeman and Citizen of the same City. In Testimony whereof the Common Council of the said City, in Common Council assembled, have Caused the Seal of the said City to be hereunto affixed this Twenty-Ninth Day of September, Anno Domini One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-Five. "By order of the Common Council, "William Sharpas, Clerk." The foregoing grant of the freedom of the city was, by order of the corporation, sent to Mr. Hamilton by Stephen Bayard, one of the aldermen, in a gold box weighing five and a half ounces, made for the occasion. On the lid of the box was engraved the arms of the city, with this motto: "DEMERSÆ LEGES TIMEFACTA LIBERTAS HÆC TANDEM EMERGUNT." On the inner side of the lid: "NON NUMMIS—VIRTUTE PARATUR." On the front of the rim of the box, a part of Tully's wish: ITA CUIQUE EVENIAT, UT DE REPUBLICA MERUIT.1 1 The first motto is altered from Cic. de Offic. lib. 2, cap. 7.—H. Zenger published the Journal on Mondays, till he died in the summer of 1746. It was continued by his widow, Catharine Zenger, till December, 1748, when she resigned the publication to her son John Zenger. Her imprint was, "New York: Printed by the Widow Cathrine Zenger, at the Printing-Office in Stone-Street; Where Advertisements are taken in, and all Persons may be supplied with this paper." She spelled her name Cathrine in all her imprints and advertisements. John Zenger, in January, 1748–9, new modelled the title of the Journal, and added a cut, coarsely executed, of a section of the royal arms, containing three lions gardant, encircled with the usual motto," Honi soit qve mal y pense;" surmounted by a crown. The imprint, "New York: Printed by John Zenger, in Stone-street, near Fort George; Where Advertisements are taken in at a moderate rate." John Zenger published this paper until about 1752, when it was discontinued, but in 1766, the title was revived by John Holt. In The New York Journal of February 25, 1751, is the following advertisement: "My country subscribers are earnestly desired to pay their arrearages for this Journal, which, if they don't speedily, I shall leave off sending, and seek my money another way. Some of these kind customers are in arrears upwards of seven years! Now as I have served them, so long, I think it is time, ay and high time too, that they give me my outset; for they may verily believe that my every-day cloathes are almost worn out. N. B. Gentlemen, If you have not ready money with you, still think of the Printer, and when you have read this Advertisement, and considered it, you cannot but say, Come Dame, (especially you inquisitive wedded men, let the Batchelors take it to themselves) let us send the poor Printer a few Gammons or some Meal, some Butter, Cheese, Poultry, &amp;c. In the mean time I am Yours, &amp;c. J. Zenger." The New York Gazette, or, Weekly Post-Boy, Was established by James Parker, in January, 1742–3, about the time that Bradford discontinued his Gazette, and he probably retained the subscribers for that paper. I have a few numbers of this Gazette published several months after its establishment, the title of which reads thus, "The New York Gazette Revived in the Weekly Post-Boy. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick." It was printed on Thursdays, on a foolscap sheet, folio. Imprint, "New York: Printed by James Parker, at the New Printing-Office in Beaver-Street, where Advertisements are taken in, and all Persons may be supplied with this Paper." Two letters appeared in the Gazette of February, 1748, reflecting upon some respectable quakers in Philadelphia. These letters were not genuine, and gave offence to some of Parker's readers. He, therefore, the 29th of that month, thus addressed the public, "Poor Printers are often under a very unhappy dilemma, of either displeasing one Part of their Benefactors, or giving Offence to others; and sometimes get the Ill-will of both sides; It has indeed been much against my Will to print any Thing, that savour'd of Forgery, Invective, or Partyism; but being too dependent, can't always avoid it: The Press is looked on as the grand Bulwark of Liberty Light, Truth and Religion; and if at any Time the Innocent is attack'd unjustly, the Gospel pronounces such Blessed; and common Sense tells us their Innocence will shine the more conspicuously thereby: But on the other Hand, it often is noted that Persons are too apt to be touch'd at having any of their Faults exposed. However, if I have openly injur'd any, I am willing as openly to vindicate them, or to give them all the Satisfaction that Reason requires without being sway'd with either their high Words or low Promises: 'But let the stricken Deer go weep, the Hart Ungall'd go play. Shakespear'" In 1753, William Weyman became the partner of Parker, aud the principal manager of the paper. It was enlarged to a crown sheet, and bore this title, The New York Gazette; or, The Weekly Post-Boy. A cut of the colony arms divided the title. A stamp act was passed by the legislature of New York, December 1, 1756, which was continued until January, 1760, but during that period this paper was sometimes published with a stamp, and sometimes without; and it often appeared without an imprint. Parker &amp; Weyman having published in the Post-Boy some "Observations on the Circumstances and Conduct of the People in the Counties of Ulster and Orange in the Province of New York," which gave offence to the assembly, they were taken into custody by the sergeant at arms; Weyman on the 18th, and Parker on his return from Woodbridge to the city, on the 23d of March, 1756. They were discharged on the 30th of the same month, after acknowledging their fault, begging pardon of the house, giving up the name of the writer, and paying fees. The writer was the Reverend Hezekiah Watkins, missionary from the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts. He lived at Newburg, in Orange county, and, by order of the house, at their next session, he was taken into custody by the sergeant at arms, brought to New York, and voted "guilty of a high misdemeanor, and contempt of the authority of the house." In a petition presented to the house he asked pardon, and promised to be more circumspect in future. He was, in consequence, brought to the bar, and there received a severe reprimand from the speaker; and, after paying the fees, was discharged.1 1 See Journal of the Assembly of New York for 1756. This paper was ably conducted. It often contained original, well written essays, moral and political; and the circulation of it was for many years very extensive. The partnership between Parker and Weyman expired in February, 1759, at which time Weyman began another paper. Parker, having assigned his paper to his nephew Samuel Parker, resided principally in New Jersey after his connection with Weyman ceased. The nephew printed the Post-Boy until July, 1760, when his uncle returned to New York, and resumed the publication. The imprint, "Printed by James Parker and Co." John Holt was the partner; but his name was not mentioned in the firm. This partnership ended in April, 1762, and Holt then printed the Post-Boy, on his own account, till October, 1766, when he relinquished it to Parker, who again resumed its publication on the 27th of November, 1766, and continued it, with some intermissions, on a demy sheet well printed, until near the time of his death in 1770. See Appendix I. The Gazette and Post-Boy, like many other American newspapers published at that time, appeared in mourning on the 31st of October, 1765, on account of the stamp act; it was, however, carried on as usual, without any suspension, and without stamps. The Gazette dated November 7, 1765, contained an anonymous letter, directed to the publisher Holt, which he informed the public, was thrown into his printing house, and a copy of it set up at the coffeehouse. The contents of the letter were as follows, "Dulce et decorum est pro Patria mori. "Mr. Holt, As you have hitherto prov'd yourself a Friend to Liberty, by publishing such Compositions as had a Tendency to promote the Cause, we are encouraged to hope you will not be deterred from continuing your useful Paper, by groundless Fear of the detestable Stamp-Act. However, should you at this critical Time, shut up the Press, and basely desert us, depend upon it, your House, Person and Effects, will be in imminent Danger: We shall therefore, expect your Paper on Thursday as usual; if not, on Thursday Evening—take C A R E. Signed in the Names and by Order of a great Number of the Free-born Sons of New-York. "John Hampden. "On the Turf, the 2d of November, 1765." To the title of the Gazette of November 7, 1765, was added in a large type this motto: "The United Voice of all His Majesty's free and loyal Subjects in America— Liberty, Property, and no Stamps." On August 27, 1770, Samuel Inslee and Anthony Carr published this paper, and continued it two years. The publication was then suspended for several months; but in August, 1773, it was renewed by Samuel F. Parker and John Anderson. They printed the Post-Boy but a short time, when it was discontinued; having completed a period of thirty years from its first appearance before the public. The New York Evening Post. This was the fourth newspaper established in that city, and it was printed by Henry De Foreest. It appeared before the year 1746, and was continued until 1747. Thus far I speak with certainty; but how long before 1746, and how long after 1747, it was published, I have not been able to ascertain. It was printed weekly, on Monday. If we may judge of the editorial abilities, and the correctness of the printer, by the following extract from the Evening Post of October 13, 1746, we shall not be led to rank him with the editor of the present New York Evening Post,1 1 William Coleman, born 1766, died 1829. who is one of the most able and celebrated conductors of a public journal in the United States. "Last Friday arrived here Capt. Griffin from Boston, who informs, that as soon as they heard of the French Fleet, the Bostoneers was in the greatest hurrey imaginable to Fortifie the Place, which they have done in a very strong manner; that there wat 30,000 fighting men, wereof was 700 Horse; they are very well provided with all manner of war like stores, and ready if Monsieaur should pay them a Visit, to give him a very warm Reception."2 2 A fleet from Brest was then on the coast, destined, as supposed, to attack Boston or New York. Fleet, who republished the above paragraph in the Boston Evening Post of October 20, 1746, thus commented upon it." Here's Veracity, Orthography and Grammar, all in the Compass of a few Lines; and Brother Type may well expect the Thanks of some Gentlemen, for the great Honour he has done them in his inimitable Piece." After this paper was discontinued, there were only two published in that city until 1759, viz: Parker's Gazette, and Gaine's Mercury. The New York Mercury. Containing the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick. The Mercury was first introduced to the public on the 3d of August, 1752.1 1 If the numbers of Gaine's paper in 1763 and 1764 are correct, the Mercury must have been first published in October, 1752; but the above date is from a reeord, and I believe is as it, should be. It was published weekly, on Monday, on a crown sheet, folio; a cut of the king's arms was early introduced into and divided the title; this cut, in the year 1763, was exchanged for a figure of Mercury; some years after, the arms of the province took the place of Mercury, when the title was altered to The New York Gazette and the Weekly Mercury; and, in 1777, the king's arms again appeared in the title. The usual imprint for many years was, "Printed hy Hugh Gaine, Printer, Bookseller and Stationer, at the Bible and Crown, in Hanover-Square." For a few years, the collection of intelligence in this paper was not inferior to that of any paper published in the city. Its circulation became extensive, and it gained many advertising customers.2 2 In August, 1769, Gaine, in transmitting his statement of account with Sir William Johnson, for books, and printing the Common Prayer Book in the Mohawk language, writes that he has not included the amount for the newspaper, for the reason that he does not remember how much is due, but he thinks it is not less than ten years; showing that the memory of man was not commensurate with the length of credit given by the old printers!—M. On the 12th of May, 1753, Gaine published in the Mercury a part of the proceedings of the assembly of New York, and the king's instructions to governor Osborne, I believe without permission, and not correctly; for which he was called to the bar of the house on the Wednesday following. On asking pardon, he was merely reprimanded by the speaker, and dismissed. In 1775, a series of well written essays, under the title of The Watch Tower, were published in this paper. During the political contest with Great Britain, the Mercury appeared rather as a neutral paper. Gaine seemed desirous to side with the successful party; but not knowing which would eventually prevail, he seems to have been unstable in his politics. After the war commenced, he leaned toward the country. When the British army approached New York in 1776, Gaine removed to Newark, in New Jersey, and there, during a few weeks, published the Mercury. Soon after the British gained possession of the city of New York, he returned, and printed under the protection of the king's army; and, like Rivington, devoted his paper to the royal cause. During the war both Gaine and Rivington were taken notice of by a poet to whom the muses were auspicious.1 1 Philip Freneau, born in New York, 1752; died at Monmouth, N. J., 1832. He was at different times editor of papers in New York, Philadelphia and New Jersey. Several poetical essays, of which Gaine and Rivington were the heroes, appeared in the newspapers, and afforded no small degree of amusement to those who were acquainted with these noted typographers; particularly a versification of Gaines's petition to the republican government of the state, at the close of the war. See Appendix J. Gaine published the Mercury until peace was established, and it was then discontinued, after an existence of about thirty-one years. The New York Gazette. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. This paper made its first appearance February 17, 1759. It was printed on a crown sheet, folio, every Monday, with the king's arms in the title; and the typography was not inferior to that of the other newspapers published in the city. Weyman, who had been many years the partner of Parker, and manager of the Gazette and Post-Boy, was encouraged and handsomely supported by subscribers; and for some time he had a share of advertising customers. After publishing this paper several years, his subscribers dropped off, his advertising customers decreased, and the publication of the Gazette was several times suspended. Weyman, who was printer to the colony, in November, 1766, published in his Gazette, the address of the house of representatives to his excellency the governor, in answer to his speech at the opening of the session of the general assembly; in doing which, he neglected, contrary to the rules of his profession, to read by copy, and to revise his proof sheet; in consequence of this neglect two gross errors escaped from his press. One was, the insertion of the word never instead of ever; the other was the omission of the word no. The sentence in which the word was omitted, should have read thus—"Your excellency has done us no more than strict justice in supposing that we will cheerfully cooperate with you." Two days after the publication of this address in the Gazette, the printer was ordered to attend the house, and he attended accordingly. Being asked by the speaker, "Whether he printed The New York Gazette," which was shown to him; and answering in the affirmative, he was asked, "Why he had in his said Gazette, reprinted the address to his excellency Sir Henry Moore, in a manner injurious to the honor and dignity of the house?" He replied, that "he was very innocent of the alteration made in the said address, till a number of the Gazettes had been distributed; that upon discovering the mistakes he immediately corrected the press, and endeavored to get back all the erroneous copies; that he had charged one of his journeymen with making the alterations, but could not prove the fact upon him; and that as the same had not been printed with any design by him, he hoped the house would pardon his inadvertency." Weyman was directed to withdraw; and, the house proceeded to the consideration of the excuse he had offered; after which he was ordered to attend the house, with his journeyman, William Finn, the next morning at ten o'clock. Weyman and his journeyman attended according to order, and being placed at the bar of the house, Weyman was further examined; the house then resolved, that the errors made in reprinting the address, "appeared to be done through the carelessness and inadvertency of the said Weyman, without any design in him of reflecting on the house." Weyman thereupon made an acknowledgment of his fault, asked pardon of the house, and promising to behave more circumspectly for the future, was discharged from further attendance."1 1 Extract from the journals of the general assembly of New York, 1766. Weyman, in his next New York Gazette, apologized to the public for the errors he had committed when "reprinting" the address; and in his apology inserted the story of the blunder made in an edition of The Book of Common Prayer, as follows. "A printer in England, who printed The Book of Common Prayer, unluckily omitted the letter c in the word changed in the following sentence —"We shall all be Changed in the twinkling of an eye." A clergyman, not so attentive to his duty as he should have been, read it to his congregation as it was printed, thus—"We shall all be Hanged in the twinkling of an eye." "Hence", said Weyman, "must appear what a most significant alteration is made in the sense when only a single letter is either added or omitted in a word in printing or reading; and evinces the great necessity of the utmost care being taken in both." Sentences of authors have often been rendered ludicrous by the errors of the press. Even the Bible has not escaped. In an edition of Brackenriclge's Law Miscellanies, "the younger practioner of the bar," was rendered "the young cur practioner." In Scotland, that land proverbial for its correct Biblical typography, in the pocket Bible, printed there about 1760, this sentence in Jude, "Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire," was rendered, "Suffering the vengeance of eternal life." In a quarto Bible printed in Scotland, thousands of copies of which were sold in America, in the prohibition for marriages was the following, "A man may not marry his wife's mother's brother." In a Bible printed in England, the negative not was omitted in the seventh commandment. Numerous errors of the like kind with these have been discovered in various editions of the Bible. In an 8vo edition printed for me, in 1802, in the third of Job, instead of "sighing cometh before I eat," it was printed "fishing before I eat." In the small Bible printed by Aitkin in Philadelphia, during the revolutionary war; in 2d Kings, 7, 12, "I will now shew you what the Syrians," etc., it was printed "I will not shew," etc. [In O'Callaghan's List of Editions of the Holy Scriptures, a table is given of the errors and variations in noted editions of Catholic Bibles, and also in a large number of American Bibles.—M.] Weyman made several severe attacks on Parker, his late partner, who was comptroller of the post office, and indirectly accused him of giving orders to postriders not to circulate The New York Gazette; but it does not appear that the comptroller of the post office did anything more, at that time, than to require the publishers of newspapers to furnish saddlebags for postriders, in which newspapers might be carried separate from the mail, the contents of which, it was said, often received injury from the dampness of newspapers. By several of Weyman's remarks, it is evident he was not on good terms with Parker after they separated; and Weyman, in some of his addresses to the public, mentioned that he had "to struggle hard against many inconveniences, joined to his incumbrance occasioned by the short circulation of cash, and the arrearages of his customers." We do not often exhibit liberality toward those of the same profession with ourselves, who, as we imagine, enjoy a degree of prosperity superior to that which falls to our lot, or consider whether the cause of our inferiority may not be negligence or misfortune. Parker, by a long course of business, and good management of his affairs, possessed a very handsome property. Weyman, from various causes, was not so fortunate, and therefore, probably, did not feel that cordiality toward his former partner, he otherwise might. However this may have been, Weyman actually brought the following charge against one of the postmasters general, and the comptroller of the post-office, both of whom were publishers of newspapers, viz: of "endeavoring to stop the circulation, by post, of any newspapers but their own, under a base conclusion, that every government ought to take its own newspapers." Weyman's valedictory gives us an idea of his circumstances, his feelings, and his editorial abilities. It is as follows. "The Subscriber having lately given a Hint of his Intention to Stop this Gazette, from a base we may say villainous Attempt to suppress the Distribution of News-Papers, from one Government to another, made by a P. Master General 10 or 12 years ago, and lately put into Execution by one of his Servants, (who with his Colleague first Schem'd the Matter). This egregious Attack on the Usefulness of the Press (which seems to be prosecuted) joined with the Printer's private Affairs, obliges him to inform the Publick of a total stop this Day. All other Work will still be performed with that Dispatch and Care the Nature of the Business will admit of.—He gives Thanks from his Heart and not from his Tongue to all his good Encouragers, at times, hitherto.—A singular Paper may appear at Times, with the best Intelligences, to be sold cheap without Subscription, English Method. Advertisements whose Times are not expired, their Money shall be returned, if demanded, after a proper Allowance. From such an unparalleled Oppression, as mentioned at first, and my innate Concerns, I am obliged to subscribe myself, The Publick's Most Thankful and Most Obedient Humble Servant, W. Weyman." This Gazette terminated December 28, 1767, after it had been published about nine years. The publisher died in July following. Note.—Weyman began in 1764 to print the Book of Common Prayer, by order of Sir Wm. Johnson. The work met with so many hindrances, that in 1768, when Weyman died, only 74 pages had been completed. An account of the origin and progress of this work is given by Dr. O'Callaghan in vol. viii, pp. 815–17, Doc. Colonial History of New York. The printing of the work was finished by Hugh Gaine.—M. The American Chronicle, Was published, if I recollect aright, rather short of two years. I cannot be certain that I am altogether correct as to the title. I once owned a file of this paper, but lost it many years since. It was handsomely printed, on a crown sheet, folio. The title was in German text, well engraved on a block. Samuel Farley, the printer and publisher of it, was an Englishman.1 1 See vol. 1, p. 305. Before the Chronicle had fully gained an establishment, the house in which it was printed took fire and was consumed. The paper was first printed in 1761, and was discontinued, in consequence of the fire, in 1762. The New York Pacquet. A paper with this title was published in New York in the year 1753. How long before this period the paper was in circulation, or how long after, I am unable to say. I cannot discover any one who is able to give me information respecting it. It was published but a short time. The New York Journal, or General Advertiser. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. Holt, the editor of this Journal, began the publication of it May 29, 1766, with new types, &amp;c., but issued only "Numb. 1," when it was suspended, and he resumed printing Parker's New York Gazette, which he had relinquished the preceding week.1 1 See New York Gazette; and Weekly Post-Boy. He continued to publish the Gazette till the 9th of October following, when he again resigned the Gazette to the proprietor, and on the 16th of that month recommenced publishing the Journal, which he did not again lay aside; he, however, began this second publication of the Journal with "Numb. 1241," following that of Parker's Gazette. Of course Parker's Gazette and Holt's Journal had the same number weekly at the head of their respective papers, and both were published on Thursday. The imprint to the Journal was, "New York: Printed and Published by John Holt, near the Exchange, (For six years last past, publisher of the New York Thursday's Gazette and Weekly Post-Boy.") At first the title was without a cut, but in a short time it appeared with the king's arms; which, until 1775, decorated the titles of many of the newspapers on the continent of North America, as well as those of the West India islands. In 1774, Holt discarded the cut of the king's arms from the title of the Journal, and in its place introduced that of a snake divided into parts, with the motto "Unite or die." In January, 1775, the snake was united, and coiled with the tail in its mouth, forming a double ring; within the coil was a pillar standing on Magna Charta, and surmounted with the cap of liberty; the pillar on each side was supported by six arms and hands, figurative of the colonies.1 1 On this occasion the following lines appeared in Rivington's Gazette. One of the allusions will be better understood by reference to the original cut; it cannot be explained here (see Sargent's Loyalist Poetry, 147).—M. 'Tis true Johnny Holt you have caused us some pain, By changing your Head-piece again and again: But then to your praise it may justly be said, You have giv'n us a notable Tail-piece instead. 'Tis true, that the Arms of a good British King Have been forced to give way to a Snake—with a Sting; Which some would interpret as tho' it implied That the King by the wound of that Serpent had died. But now must their Malice all sink into Shade, By the happy device which you lately displayed; And Tories themselves be convinced you are slandered Who see you've erected the Right Royal Standard! On the body of the snake, beginning at the head, were the following lines, "United now, alive and free, Firm on this basis Liberty shall stand, And, thus supported, ever bless our land Till Time becomes Eternity." Holt had published Parker's Gazette, first in company with Parker, and afterwards on his own account, from 1760 to 1766. As I have before observed, he began the second publication of the Journal with No. 1241, following in order the number of the Gazette which he published the preceding week. For this he assigned as a reason, that he should be able the more readily to settle with his customers. He seemed to consider the subscribers to Parker's Gazette as his customers, and the Journal as a continuation of the Gazette, which he had lately published. He mentioned his "having occasion to alter the title of his paper, "meaning Parker's Gazette; "and, that he had altered it, first for the sake of distinction, as he was informed Parker intended publishing a paper under the former title; and, secondly, because, as Parker formerly published a paper under that title, he, Holt, would not avail himself of any advantages from a name originally assumed by Parker." The fact was, Parker ever had been the proprietor of the Gazette and Post-Boy, and had taken Holt as a partner; and, two years after, when the copartnership ended, leased to him his paper and establishment. Holt could not command any property when he became the partner of Parker, who had been many years in business, and had acquired much celebrity as a printer, of which Holt as his partner was a partaker, and derived much benefit from it; but after his partnership and the subsequent lease of Parker's establishment had expired, and he began business for himself, he appeared disposed to retain both Parker's Gazette, and the purchasers of it, without due compensation. Holt procured a new printing-apparatus at the time he began the Journal. This paper soon had a very extensive circulation; it was sent to all who had been customers to the Gazette; and was generally received. The Journal was a zealous advocate for the American cause; it was supported by many able writers besides the editor; and it maintained its ground until the British army took possession of the city of New York, in 1776, when the publisher of it removed to Kingston (Esopus), and the Journal was discontinued several months; but was revived at that place in July, 1777. Esopus was burned by the British in October of that year, and Holt removed to Poughkeepsie, where he published the Journal until the termination of the war. In the Autumn of 1783, it was again printed in the city of New York, with an alteration in the title, as follows: The Independent Gazette; or The New York Journal Revived. In January, 1784, it was printed, from a new and handsome burgeois type, "at No. 47, opposite the Upper Corner of the Old-Slip, Hanover-Square;" and was published twice a week, on Thursdays and Saturdays; but before the close of that month the editor, Holt, died. Elizabeth Holt continued the Journal, after her husband's decease, until 1785, but it appeared only on Thursdays.1 1 For a few months, in 1781, it was published by Eleazar Oswald for Elizabeth Holt; and afterwards, to January, 1787, it was printed in the name of Eleazar Oswald. In January, 1787, Elizabeth Holt and Oswald2 2 Oswald was the kinsman of Mrs. Holt. He had been a colonel in the American army. In 1782, he commenced the publication of the Independent Gazetteer, in Philadelphia. This paper was continued during his connection with the New York Journal, and for several years after. He died in September, 1795. sold their right in the Journal, and their establishment, comprising the whole of their printing materials, to Thomas Greenleaf. Greenleaf, soon after he came into possession of the Journal, printed it daily, or rather, he made the establishment the foundation of two papers. One he published with the same title, weekly, on Thursday, for the country; the other, intended for circulation in the city, bore the title of The New York Journal, and Daily Patriotic Register. The titles of these papers were afterwards altered. That printed daily was called The Argus, or Greenleaf's New Daily Advertiser; and the weekly paper was published twice a week, and entitled Greenleaf's New York Journal and Patriotic Register. When the two great political parties were forming, subsequent to the organization of the federal government, that which opposed the administration, attacked the measures of the venerable Washington with a great degree of virulence, in Greenleaf's paper. Greenleaf was born at Abington, in Massachusetts, and was taught printing in Boston, by Isaiah Thomas. He was the son of Joseph Greenleaf, who, at an advanced age, in 1774, engaged in the printing business at Boston. He continued the papers above mentioned until 1798; at which time the yellow fever raged in New York, and great numbers left the city to escape that pestilence; but Greenleaf remained at his post, took the disease, and fell a victim to it at the age of forty-two years. He was well acquainted with his business, enterprising, and amiable in his manners. After his decease, his widow, Ann Greenleaf, published both the semi-weekly and daily paper for a time; but eventually sold her establishment to James Cheetham, who altered the title of both papers. The one published semi-weekly was now called, The American Watchtower, and the daily paper bore the title of The American Citizen. Cheetham was born and brought up in England. He was not bred to printing, but he was a very able editor, and a distinguished writer. Occasionally the vigor and pungency of his style remind his readers of the productions of the renowned Junius.1 1 He died 19th September, 1810, aged 37, and the Citizen was discontinued in November following.—M. The New York Chronicle. I have not been able to ascertain, accurately, when this paper first made its appearance, or when it was discontinued; but it was published by Alexander and James Robertson, and commenced either in 1768 or 1769. Not long after the close of the year 1770, the printers of the Chronicle removed to Albany, and the publication of it ceased. Rivington's New-York Gazetteer; or The Connecticut, New-Jersey, Hudson's River, and Quebec Weekly Advertiser. This Gazette commenced its career April 22, 1778, on a large medium sheet, folio. It was printed weekly, on Thursday; and when it had been established one year, this imprint followed the title, "Printed at his Ever open and uninfluenced press, fronting Hanover-Square." A large cut of a ship under sail was at first introduced into the title, under which were the words New York Packet. This cut soon gave place to one of a smaller size. In November, 1774, the ship was removed and the king's arms took the place of it. In August, 1775, the words "Ever open and uninfluenced" were omitted in the imprint. The Gazetteer was patronized in all the principal towns by the advocates of the British administration who approved the measures adopted toward the colonies; and it undoubtedly had some support from "his Majesty's government." The paper obtained an extensive circulation, but eventually paid very little respect to "the majesty of the people;" and, in consequence, the paper and its publisher soon became obnoxious to the whigs. Rivington continued the Gazetteer until November 27, 1775; on which day a number of armed men from Connecticut entered the city, on horseback, and beset his habitation, broke into his printing house, destroyed his press, threw his types into heaps, and carried away a large quantity of them, which they melted and formed into bullets. A stop was thus put to the Gazetteer.1 1 For an account of this affair, see New York Hist. Collections, p. 301.—M. Soon after this event, Rivington went to England, where he supplied himself with a new printing apparatus, and was appointed king's printer for New York. After the British gained possession of the city, he returned; and, on October 4, 1777, recommenced the publication of his Gazette under the original title; but in two weeks he exchanged that title for the following, Rivington's New York Loyal Gazette; and on the 13th of December following, he called his paper The Royal Gazette. Imprint, "Published by James Rivington, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty." The Royal Gazette was numbered as a continuation of the Gazetteer, and Loyal Gazette, and was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays; printed on a sheet of royal size, with the royal arms in the title. Rivington could not consistently have given the Royal Gazette the motto selected by our brethren, the printers of the (Boston) Independent Chronicle—"Truth its Guide, and Liberty its Object." This Gazette was, by some, called The Brussels Gazette1 1 A paper published at Brussels many years since, which was notorious for falsehood. of America; but it commonly went by the name of Rivington's lying Gazette. Even the royalists censured Rivington for his disregard to truth. During the war, a captain of militia at Horseneck, with about thirty men, marched to Kingsbridge, and there attacked a house within the British lines, which was garrisoned by refugees, and took most of them prisoners. Rivington published an account of this transaction which greatly exaggerated the affair in favor of the refugees; he observed that a large detachment of rebels attacked the house, which was bravely defended by a refugee colonel, a major, a quartermaster, and fifteen privates; and that after they were taken and carried off, another party of refugee dragoons, seventy-three in number, pursued the rebels, killed twenty-three of them, took forty prisoners, and would have taken the whole rebel force, had not the refugee horse "been jaded to a stand still." Several times did Rivington apologize for mistakes made in paragraphs which he himself had manufactured for his Gazette. The following appeared in the Royal Gazette of July 10, 1782, when there was a prospect of peace. "To the Public.—The publisher of this paper, sensible that his zeal for the success of his Majesty's arms, his sanguine wishes for the good of his country, and his friendship for individuals, have at times led him to credit and circulate paragraphs without investigating the facts so closely as his duty to the Public demanded; trusting to their feelings, and depending on their generosity, he begs them to look over past errors, and depend on future correctness. From henceforth he will neither expect nor solicit their favors longer than his endeavors shall stamp the same degree of authenticity and credit on the Royal Gazette (of New York) as all Europe allow to the Royal Gazette of London." See Appendix K. During the war, a newspaper was published daily in the city of New York under the following arrangement: Rivington's Royal Gazette on Wednesday and Saturday, Gaine's Gazette or Mercury on Monday, Robertson's, Mills &amp; Hick's Royal American Gazette, on Thursday—and Lewis's New York Mercury and General Advertiser on Friday. These papers were all published under the sanction of the British commander in chief; but none of the printers assumed the title of "Printers to the King" except Rivington, who had an appointment. When the war ended, Rivington discarded from his paper the appendages of royalty. The arms of Great Britain no longer appeared. It was no more The Royal, or a Loyal Gazette, but a plain republican newspaper, entitled Rivington's New York Gazette and Universal Advertiser. It was, however, considered as a wolf in sheep's clothing, and, not meeting with support, the publication of it terminated, and the editorial, labors of Rivington ended, in the year 1783. Few men, perhaps, were better qualified than the editor of the Royal Gazette to publish a newspaper. It has been remarked (page 309, vol. 1), that for some time Rivington conducted his paper with as much impartiality as most of the editors of that period; and it may be added, that no newspaper in the colonies was better printed, or was more copiously furnished with foreign intelligence. In October, 1773, Rivington informed his readers that each impression of his weekly Gazetteer, amounted to 3,600 copies. The Constitutional Gazette, Was first issued from the press of John Anderson, in August, 1775; the publication of which was on Mondays and Thursdays, and continued but a few months. It was printed on a half sheet, quarto, of crown paper. It seems to have borrowed its title from a political paper published in New Jersey ten years before; but it resembled that paper in the name only. The New York Packet, and the American Advertiser. The publication of this paper commenced the first week in January, 1776. It was printed Thursdays, on a sheet of royal folio, with a new long primer type. Imprint: "Printed by Samuel Loudon, in Water-Street, between the Coffee-House and the Old Slip." I take notice of this paper, although, it originated after the war began, because it was the last established in the city before the declaration of independence. Loudon died at Middletown Point, New Jersey, February 24, 1813, in the ninetieth year of his age. During the war it was published at Fishkill; after the return of peace it was again printed in the city; it was finally changed to a daily paper, and continued several years. OTHER PERIODICAL WORKS PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK BEFORE 1775. The Independent Reflector. This was a neatly printed paper, published weekly on Thursday, on a sheet of foolscap writing, folio, by James Parker. It contained moral and political essays, but no news. It first appeared on November 30, 1752, and the publication of it was supported two years. The pieces in it were written by a society of literary gentlemen, in and near New York; several of whom were afterwards highly distinguished in public life. The late Governor Livingston, the Rev. Aaron Burr, president of New Jersey College, John Morin Scott, Gen. William Alexander, known afterwards as Lord Stirling, and William Smith, who died chief justice of Canada, were reputed to be writers for the Reflector. This work, it has been said, ultimately gave much offence to men in power, by whom the writers for it were silenced. Parker appeared to be intimidated, and declined being further concerned in the publication. "The authors applied to him to publish, by way of supplement, a vindication of the work, with an account of its origin and design, and the cause of its being discontinued. He refused, and some suspected that he was drawn off by those in office, instead of being alarmed into a relinquishment of the work. After Parker declined, De Foreest was applied to, who consented to print the supplement; and in an advertisement said, or was made to say, that 'the writers of the Reflector, on this occasion, were obliged to employ the worst printer in the city.'" These were not, I believe, the identical words used on the occasion, but it is the import of them. John Englishman, in Defence of the English Constitution: Printed on a half sheet, foolscap, and published weekly, on Friday, by Parker and Weyman. It was continued about three months. ALBANY. A newspaper was first published in this city in 1772.1 1 This paper was begun in 1771; hence Albany was the second city in the State of New York, into which printing was introduced. It is inferred that these printers were not established here till late in the season, from the fact that the city charter was printed this year in New York by Hugh Gaine. The only work that I have seen of their printing is the city ordinances of 1773, which is better executed than the charter by Gaine. A book store was kept before the revolution by Stuart Wilson, in a Dutch house on the upper corner of North Pearl and State streets. The next paper here was the New York Gazetteer and Northern Intelligencer, which was first published in May, 1782, by Balentine &amp; Webster. It was printed on a sheet of short demy, with pica and long primer types, at 13s. ($1.62 1/2) a year. Advertisements of subscribers were to be inserted three weeks gratis. Balentine was addicted to intemperance, and Webster separated from him at the end of a year. The former then enlarged the size of his paper, but abandoned it after one year, when Webster returned from New York, and began the publication of the Albany Gazette, which was continued until 1845, The only works printed by Balentine &amp; Webster, that have come to light, are a pamphlet, by the Rev. Thomas Clarke, of Cambridge, Washington county, entitled Plain Seasons, being a dissuasive from the use of Watts's version of the Psalms, in worship, and an Almanac for 1783. The only work known of Balantine's press, is an Almanac of 1784. Mr. Webster began an Almanac in 1784, for the year following, entitled Webster's Calendar, or the Albany Almanac, which is still published, and is the oldest almanac extant in the United States.—M. Alexander and James Robertson were its publishers. The Albany Post-Boy.1 1 The copies of this paper are entitled The Albany Gazette as far as they can be found. The publication seems to have begun in November, 1771. The earliest copy that has been discovered after a search of many years, is No. 8, dated Jan. 20, 1772, and there are a few copies of about that date preserved in the collection of the Albany Institute. In one of these the publisher, "from motives of gratitude and duty," apologized to the public for the omission of one week's publication, and hoped that the irregularity of the mail from New York, since the first great fall of snow, and the severe cold preceding Christmas, which froze the paper prepared for press, so as to put a stop to its operation, would sufficiently account for it. Alexander Robertson died at Port Roseway, Nova Scotia, Nov. 1784, aged 42. James returned to Edinburgh, and was in business there in 1810, and although I have endeavored to trace him since, all effort has failed.—M. The publication of it ended in 1775. The Robertsons, as has been observed under the head Connecticut, &amp;c., were, in 1773, concerned in printing The Norwich Packet; and it is not improbable that, at the same time, one of them resided in Albany and conducted the Post-Boy. In 1776, they joined the royalists in the city of New York.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">NEW JERSEY. Newspapers were not published in this colony before the declaration of independence. The New Jersey Gazette, Was published at Burlington, December 3, 1777. It was printed weekly, on Wednesday, with a good, long primer type, and on a sheet of crown paper, folio. Imprint, "Burlington: Printed by Isaac Collins. All Persons may be supplied with this Gazette for Twenty-Six Shillings per Annum. Advertisements of a moderate Length are inserted for Seven Shillings and Six Pence the first Week, and Two Shillings and Six Pence for every continuance; and long Ones in proportion." This paper was neatly printed, and well conducted. Its publisher., although of the society of Friends, was a firm supporter of the rights of his country; and he carefully avoided publishing any thing which tended to injure the religious, civil, or political interests of his fellow citizens. It was discontinued in 1786.1 1 The New Jersey Journal was printed on a cap sheet by Shepard Kolloch at Chatham, of which No. 71 is dated June 21, 1780.—M. MAGAZINE, &amp;c., PUBLISHED IN NEW JERSEY BEFORE 1775. New American Magazine. This work was begun at Woodbridge by James Parker, in January, 1758, and was continued monthly more than two years. Each number contained forty pages, octavo. Although this was a valuable literary work, and but one of the kind was then published in the colonies,1 1 The American Magazine or Monthly Chronicle, printed at Philadelphia; but which was discontinued soon after the appearance of this from the press at Woodbridge. there was not a sufficient number of copies sold to defray the expense of printing, &amp;c. It was, therefore, discontinued, after being published twenty-seven months. Ten years after, a large number of the copies were sold by the printer for waste paper. The editor was the honorable Samuel Nevil, under the signature of Sylvanus Americanus. Judge Nevil was from England, and had been editor of The London Evening Post. He had received a liberal education, his knowledge was extensive, and his writings commanded considerable attention. He was a judge of the supreme court of New Jersey, speaker of the house of assembly, and mayor of the city of Amboy. He died at Perth Amboy, in November, 1764, aged sixty-seven years. The Constitutional Courant. After the American stamp act was passed by the British parliament, and near the time it was to be put in operation, a political paper was privately printed in "Woodbridge, which attracted much notice. It was entitled "The Constitutional Courant, containing Matters interesting to Liberty— but no wise repugnant to Loyalty." Imprint, "Printed by Andrew Marvel, at the Sign of the Bribe refused, on Constitution-Hill, North America." In the centre of the title was a device of a snake, cut into parts, to represent the colonies. Motto—"Join or die." After the title, followed an address to the public from the fictitious printer and publisher, Andrew Marvel. This paper was without date, but was printed in September, 1765. It contained several well written and spirited essays against the obnoxious stamp act, which were so highly colored, that the editors of newspapers in New York, even Holt, declined to publish them. See Appendix L. A large edition was printed, secretly forwarded to New York, and there sold by hawkers selected for the purpose. It had a rapid sale, and was, I believe, reprinted there, and at Boston. It excited some commotion in New York, and was taken notice of by government. A council was called, and holden at the fort in that city, but as no discovery was made of the author or printer, nothing was done. One of the council demanded of a hawker named Lawrence Sweeney, "where that incendiary paper was printed?" Sweeney, as he had been instructed, answered, "At Peter Hassenclever's iron-works, please your honor." Peter Hassenclever was a wealthy German, well known as the owner of extensive iron works in New Jersey. Afterwards, other publications of a like kind frequently appeared with an imprint, "Printed at Peter Hassenclever's iron-works." Only one number of the Constitutional Courant1 1 See Buckingham's Reminiscences, 1, 246. There is a copy of this paper in the University library, at Cambridge.—M. was published; a continuance of it was never intended. It was printed by William Goddard, at Parker's printing house in Woodbridge, Goddard having previously obtained Parker's permission occasionally to use his press. This political paper was handsomely commended in some of the periodical works published in England, after the repeal of the stamp act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PENNSYLVANIA. Before the year 1719, only one newspaper was printed in the British North American colonies. It was published at Boston; and, on the 21st of December, in that year, the second American journal appeared at the same place. 1 1 The Boston Gazette. On the following day the third paper was brought forward in the capital of this province. PHILADELPHIA. In 1760, there were only three newspapers published in that city, viz: two in English, and one in the German language. In 1762, two English and two German papers existed; one of the latter was afterwards discontinued; and from that time until the year 1773, only three papers, two English and one German, were printed in Philadelphia. The first newspaper in Pennsylvania was entitled, No. 1. The AMERICAN Weekly Mercury. TUESDAY, December, 22, 1719. It was printed on a half sheet of pot. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed by Andrew Bradford, and Sold by him and John Copson." May 25, 1721, 2 2 Copson at that time opened the first insurance office in Philadelphia. Copson's name was omitted in the imprint, which was altered thus—"Philadelphia: Printed and Sold by Andrew Bradford, at the BIBLE in Second Street; and also by William Bradford in New York, where Advertisements are taken in." William Bradford's name as a vender of the Mercury in New York, was omitted in December, 1725. In January, 1730, an addition was made to the imprint, viz. "Price 10s. per Annum. All sorts of Printing Work done cheap, and old Books neatly bound." In 1738, it was printed in "Front Street," to which he transferred his sign of the Bible. The Mercury occasionally appeared on a whole sheet of pot, from types of various sizes, as small pica, pica and english. It was published weekly, generally on Tuesday, but the day of publication was varied. In January, 174 2/3, the day of the week is omitted; and it is dated from January 18 to January 27; after that time it was conducted with more stability. In No. 22, two cuts, coarsely engraven, were introduced, one on the right, and the other on the left of the title; the one on the left, was a small figure of Mercury, bearing his caduceus; he is represented walking, with extended wings; the other is a postman riding full speed. The cuts were sometimes shifted, and Mercury and the postman exchanged places. The Mercury of December 13, 1739, was "Printed by Andrew and William Bradford," and on September 11, 1740, it had a new head, with three figures, well executed; on the left was Mercury; in the centre a town, intended, I suppose, to represent Philadelphia; and, on the right, the postman on horseback; the whole formed a parrallelogram, and extended across the page from margin to margin. This partnership continued only eleven months, when the Mercury was again printed by Andrew Bradford alone. The typography of the Mercury was equal to that of Franklin's Gazette. Andrew Bradford died November 23, 1742, and the next Mercury, dated December 2, appeared in mourning. The paper was suspended one week, on account of the death of Bradford; therefore the first paper, "published by the widow Bradford,"1 1 Andrew Bradford's widow, Cornelia. [No monument marks the place of Bradford's burial. See Jones's Address on Andrew Bradford, pp. 28– 31.—M.] contained an extra half sheet. The tokens of mourning were continued six weeks. The widow entered into partnership with Isaiah Warner, and the Mercury of March 1, 174 2/3, bears this imprint, "Printed by Isaiah Warner and Cornelia Bradford." Warner, in an introductory advertisement, informed the public, that the paper would be conducted by him. Cornelia Bradford resumed the publication, October 18, 1744, and carried it on in her own name till the end of 1746. It was, I believe, soon after discontinued. The Mercury was well printed on a good type, during the whole time she had the management of it. The Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences; And Pennsylvania Gazette. This was the second newspaper established in the province; it has been continued under the title of the Pennsylvania Gazette to the present time, and is now (1810), the oldest newspaper in the United States. No. 1 was published December 24, 1728, by Samuel Keimer, on a small sheet, pot size, folio. In No. 2 the publisher adopted the style of the quakers, and dated it, "The 2d of the 11th mo. 1728." The first and second pages of each sheet were generally occupied with extracts from Chambers's Dictionary; this practice was continued until the 25th of the 7th mo., 1729, in which the article Air concludes the extracts. When the paper had been published nine months, the printer had not procured one hundred subscribers. Franklin, soon after he began business, formed the design of publishing a newspaper, but was prevented by the sudden appearance of this Gazette; he was greatly disappointed; and, as he observes, used his endeavors to bring it into contempt. He was successful, and the publisher, being obliged to relinquish it, for a trifling consideration resigned it to Franklin. At this time, Franklin was in partnership with Hugh Meredith; they began printing this paper with No. 40, and published it a few weeks on Mondays and Thursdays, on a whole or half sheet, pot, as occasion required. The price "ten shillings per annum." The first part of the title they expunged, and called their paper The Pennsylvania Gazette. "Containing the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick." The Gazette, under their management, gained reputation, but until Franklin obtained the appointment of post-master, Bradford's Mercury had the largest circulation; after this event, the Gazette had a full proportion of subscribers and of advertising custom, and it became very profitable. Meredith and Franklin separated in May, 1732. Franklin continued the Gazette, but published it only once a week. In 1733, he printed it on a crown half sheet, in quarto. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed by B. Franklin, Post-Master, at the New Printing-Office near the Market. Price 10s. a year. Where Advertisements are taken in, and Book-Binding is done reasonably in the best manner." In 1741, he enlarged the size to a demy quarto, half sheet, and added a cut of the Pennsylvania arms in the title. In 1745, he returned to foolscap, folio. In 174 7/8 the Gazette was published "By B. Franklin, Postmaster, and D. Hall;" it was enlarged to a whole sheet, crown, folio; and afterwards, by a great increase of advertisements, to a sheet, and often to a sheet and a half, demy. On the 9th of May, 1754, the device of a snake, divided into parts, with the motto, "Join or die," I believe, first appeared in this paper. It accompanied an account of the French and Indians having killed and scalped many of the inhabitants in the frontier counties of Virginia and Pennsylvania. The account was published with this device, with a view to rouse the British colonies, and cause them to unite in effectual measures for their defence and security against the common enemy. The snake was divided into eight parts, to represent, first, New England; second, New York; third, New Jersey; fourth, Pennsylvania; fifth, Maryland; sixth, Virginia; seventh, North Carolina; and eighth, South Carolina. The account and the figures appeared in several other papers, and had a good effect. The Gazette was put into mourning October 31, 1765, on account of the stamp act, passed by the British parliament, which was to take effect the next day. From that time until the 21st of November following, the publication of it was suspended. In the interim, large handbills, as substitutes, were published, headed "Remarkable Occurrences," "No Stamped paper to be had," &amp;c. When revived, it was published without an imprint until February 6, 1766; it then appeared with the name of David Hall only, who now became the proprietor and the printer of it.1 1 See account of Franklin and Hall, vol. 1, p. 235. In May following, it was published by Hall &amp; Sellers, who continued it until 1772, when Hall died, but was succeeded by his sons; and the firm of Hall &amp; Sellers continued, and the Gazette was published until 1777, when, on the approach of the British army, the publishers retired from Philadelphia, and the publication was suspended while the British possessed the city. On the evacuation of Philadelphia the Gazette was again revived, and published once a week until the death of Sellers, in 1804. After this event, it was printed by William and David Hall, and in 1810, published by William Hall, Jr., and George Pierce, every Wednesday.1 1 There is a complete file of this paper from 1728 to 1804, in the collection of the Library Company of Philadelphia. Its publication was suspended for a short time in 1815; but it was resumed, and survived until 1823 or 1824, when it was the oldest paper in the country.—M. William Hall, Jr., died in 1813, and George Pierce in 1814. The Pennsylvania Journal and the Weekly Advertiser. This paper was first published on Tuesday, December 2, 1742. It was printed on a foolscap sheet. The day of publication was changed to Wednesday. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed by William Bradford, on the West side of Second Street, between Market and Chesnut Streets." But soon after, "at the Corner of Black-Horse-alley." About the year 1766, the imprint was, "Philadelphia: Printed and sold by William and Thomas Bradford, at the corner of Front and Market-Streets, where all persons may be supplied with this Paper at Ten Shillings a year.—And where Advertisements are taken in." In 1774, it had in the title, a large cut, the device, an open volume, on which the word "J O U R N A L" is very conspicuous; underneath the volume appears a ship under sail, inclosed in an ornamental border; the volume is supported by two large figures; the one on the right represents Fame, that on the left, one of the aborigines properly equipped. This device remained as long as the Journal was published, excepting from July 1774 to October 1775, during which time the device of the divided snake, with the motto, "UNITE OR DIE," was substituted in its room. This paper was devoted to the cause of the country; but it was suspended during the period that the British army was in possession of Philadelphia. About the year 1788, it was published semi-weekly; but its title was not altered. It continued to be headed The Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser. William Bradford died in 1791; the Journal was published by the surviving partner, until 1797, when it was finally discontinued, and the True American, a daily paper, was published in its stead. The Pennsylvania Chronicle, and Universal Advertiser. Containing the freshest Advices both Foreign and Domestick; with a Variety of other matters, useful, instructive and entertaining. "Rara Temporum Felicitas, ubi sentirc quæ velis, et quæ sentias dicere licet!"—Tacitus In the middle of the title was placed a handsome cut of the king's arms. The Chronicle was published weekly, on Monday. The first number appeared January 6, 1767, well printed from a new bourgeois type, on a large medium sheet, folio. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed by William Goddard, at the New-Printing Office, in Market-Street, near the Post-Office. Price Ten Shillings per Annum." This was the fourth newspaper in the English language established in Philadelphia, and the first with four columns to a page, printed in the northern colonies. The second and third years the Chronicle was printed in quarto, and the fourth year again in folio, but on a smaller sheet. It was ably edited; in all respects well executed; and it soon gained an extensive circulation. Joseph Galloway, a celebrated character at the commencement of the American revolution, and a delegate to the continental congress from Pennsylvania, before the declaration of independence, and Thomas Wharton, a wealthy merchant, but neither of them in the whig interest, were silent partners with Goddard. The Chronicle was established under their influence, and subject to their control, until 1770. Benjamin Towne, afterwards printer of The Pennsylvania Evening Post, was also, for a short time, a partner in the Chronicle establishment; he was introduced to this concern by Galloway and Wharton, who sold him their right in it. In 1770, Goddard separated from his partners, and the politics of the Chronicle became somewhat more in favor of the country. A portion of it was, however, for a long time, devoted by Goddard to the management of a literary warfare which took place between him and his late partners. The Chronicle was published until February, 1773. It was then discontinued, and the publisher of it removed to Baltimore. The Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser. The Packet was first issued from the press in November, 1771. It was well printed on a sheet of demy, by John Dunlap, in Market street, Philadelphia. The day of publication was Monday. A well executed cut of a ship divided the title. From September, 1777, to July 1778, when the British army was in possession of Philadelphia, the Packet was printed in Lancaster. On the return of the proprietor to Philadelphia, it was published three times in a week; but it was again reduced to twice a week, in 1780. In 1783, and until September 1784, it was published three times a week by D. C. Claypoole;1 1 Mr. Claypoole was a gentleman of the old school, supposed to have been a descendant from Oliver Cromwell, whom he is said to have resembled in feature. The debates in congress, from 1783 to 1799, were printed in his paper. He also published the first edition of Washington's Farewell Address, and had permission to preserve the manuscript, which was sold Feb. 15, 1850, by auction, and purchased by Mr. James Lenox, of New York, for upwards of $2,000. It consists of about 30 pages, in Washington's hand writing. Mr. Claypoole died March 19, 1849, aged 92.—M. it then became a daily paper, and was published by John Dunlap and David C. Claypoole, and called the Pennsylvania Packet and Daily Advertiser. It was continued till the end of the year 1790 without alteration. In January, 1791, its size was enlarged; it was printed with new type, on a super royal sheet, five columns in a page, and published by John Dunlap. In December, 1793, it was again printed and published by John Dunlap &amp; David C. Claypoole. In January, 1796, it is called Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser; and printed by David C. and Septimus Claypoole. In 1799, it is by D. C. Claypoole only, as proprietor; and October 1, 1800, Claypoole sold his right in the paper to Zachariah Poulson; who continued its publication with great reputation.1 1 Zachariah Poulson was the son of Zacharia, who was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, 16th June, 1737. He was the only son of Nicholas Paulsen, a printer, who left his native country to enjoy liberty of conscience. They arrived in Philadelphia in 1749. Zacharia learned printing of Christopher Saur, the noted German printer at Germantown, and married Anna Barbara Stallenberg. He was a man of the most exemplary piety and manners; his "countenance, on which nature had shed its bounty, was ever enhanced and lit up by the evidences of a happy train of mental associations. . . . . . His apparel was a light drab, plain cut coat, and breeches in old-time fashion." He died on the 4th of June, 1804, aged 67. It is recorded of him that he had always been esteemed, by those who knew him, for his integrity, for the sincerity and ardor of his friendship, and for his amiable and inoffensive deportment. His remains were borne to the cemetery of the Moravian church by his brethren of the typographic art (Ritter's, Hist. Moravian Church, 90, 91). The son, Zachariah junior, mentioned above, was born in Philadelphia, 5th September, 1761. He served his apprenticeship with Joseph Cruikshank, was eminent as a printer, and was for many years elected printer for the senate of the state. On the 1st of October, 1800, he undertook to conduct a daily paper, having purchased Mr. Claypoole's establishment for $10,000. Poulson continued his paper under the title of Poulson's Daily Advertiser, until Dec. 18, 1839, when it was merged in another concern. He died July 31, 1844, aged 83, "being the last link connecting the publishing fraternity with that of the days of Franklin." He had acquired a large fortune by his paper. His portrait is given in The Lives of Eminent Philadelphians. His son, Charles A. Poulson, died Feb. 15, 1866, aged 77. The Philadelphia North American with which the Advertiser was united, announced in 1867, that it had entered upon its one hundredth year, and was never more prosperous.—M. This was the first daily paper published in the United States. [See forward, under Booksellers, Philadelphia.] The Pennsylvania Ledger; or, The Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New-Jersey Weekly Advertiser. This Ledger was first published January 28, 1775. It had a cut of the king's arms in the title. It was printed on a demy sheet, folio, with new types; the workmanship was neat and correct, and it appeared on Saturdays. Imprint, "?Philadelphia: Printed by James Humphreys, Jun., in Front-Street, at the Corner of Black-horse Alley;— where Subscriptions are taken in for this Paper, at Ten Shillings per Year." The publisher announced his intention to conduct his paper with political impartiality; and, perhaps, in times more tranquil than those in which it appeared, he might have succeeded in his plan. He had, as has been stated, taken the oath of allegiance to the king of England; he pleaded the obligations of his oath, and refused to bear arms against the British government;1 1 See vol. 1, page 263. in consequence of which, he was deemed a tory, and his paper denounced as being under corrupt influence. The impartiality of the Ledger did not comport with the temper of the times; and, in November, 1776, Humphreys was obliged to discontinue it, and leave the city. A few weeks before the British troops took possession of Philadelphia, in September, 1777, Humphreys returned, remained in the city whilst it was in their possession, and renewed the publication of the Ledger; but, when the royal army evacuated the place, it was again discontinued, and never afterwards revived. Whilst the British remained in Philadelphia, the Ledger was published twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday, market days, and was called The Public Ledger and Market Day Advertiser. The last number was published May 23, 1778, and the British army quitted the city about the middle of the following month. The Pennsylvania Evening Post, Was first published January 24, 1775, by Benjamin Towne. It was well printed on half a sheet of crown paper, in quarto, and published three times in a week, viz; on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings; "Price two pennies each paper, or three Shillings the quarter." This was the third evening paper which made its appearance in the colonies; the first was The Boston Evening Post, and the second The New York Evening Post. The Rev. Dr. Witherspoon, member of congress, and some other distinguished personages of thatday, it has been said, furnished the Evening-Post occasionally, with intelligence and essays. Although the printer of the paper had been the agent of Galloway and Wharton, he was on the side of the country until the British army entered the city in 1777. He remained in Philadelphia after that event, and continued the Evening Post under the auspices of the British general, until the city was evacuated. Towne was proscribed by a law of the state of Pennsylvania; he did not, however, leave Philadelphia, but again changed his ground; and, without molestation, continued his paper until 1782, about which time the publication of it terminated. After this he occasionally published handbills, headed "All the News, for two coppers." These were hawked in the streets by himself.1 1 See Towne's Recantation, in vol. 1, Appendix H2. Story and Humphreys's Pennsylvania Mercury and Universal Advertiser. The Mercury first came before the public, in April, 1775; and was published weekly, on Friday, printed on a demy sheet, folio, with types said to be manufactured in the country. A large cut decorated the title; Britain and America were represented by two figures, facing each other, and in the act of shaking hands; underneath the figures was this motto: "Affection and Interest dictate the Union." Imprint, "Philadelphia; Printed by Story and Humphreys, in Norris's-Alley, near Front-Street, where Subscriptions, (at Ten Shillings per Annum), Advertisements, Articles and Letters of Intelligence, &amp;c. are gratefully received." The Mercury was short lived. The printing house whence it was issued, and all the printing materials therein contained, were destroyed by fire in December, 1775; and, in consequence of that event, the paper was discontinued. This was the last attempt to establish a newspaper in the city before the American revolution. At the conclusion of the war another paper by the same title was published by Humphreys, handsomely and correctly executed, and was continued for several years. GERMAN NEWSPAPERS, PRINTED IN PHILADELPHIA PREVIOUSLY TO THE YEAR 1775. A newspaper in the German language was published weekly, in Philadelphia, as early as May, 1743. The printer of it was Joseph Crellius, who first lived in Market street, but during the year removed to Arch street, where the paper was probably printed and published several years. In November, 1743, Crellius advertised in the Pennsylvania Journal, that he had opened his "Winter Evening German School, and continued to print his Weekly German Newspaper," the title of which, I am informed, was The High Dutch Pennsylvania Journal. I have not been able to procure a copy of this newspaper, but I believe it was the first that was printed in Philadelphia in the German language. In February, 1748, Godhart Armbruster commenced the publication, once in a fortnight, of a newspaper in the German language. His printing house was then in Race street. By an advertisement in The Pennsylvania Gazette of September, 1751, I find there was at that time, "A Dutch and English Gazette, containing the freshest Advices, foreign and domestick, with other entertaining and useful Matters in both Languages, adapted to the Convenience of such as incline to learn either," printed "at the German Printing-Office, in Arch-street; price five shillings per annum." "At the same place Copper-plate Printing was performed in the best Manner." The title of the newspaper was Die Beitung. The name of the publisher of this paper is not mentioned; but it is ascertained to have been Godhart Armbruster, who, in 1747, went to Europe. He returned in 1748, and brought with him a copper plate printer by the name of Behm, and a supply of new German types. This Gazette was probably that which he first published in 1748. It is mentioned in his Almanac for 1749, and was then published weekly, at ten shillings per annum. In 1751 it was printed only once in a fortnight, as at first. A press for the German language had been established in that city, for some years, at the expense of a society in London, formed for the benevolent purpose of "promoting religious knowledge among the German emigrants in Pennsylvania," School books, and religious tracts in the German language, were printed at this press; and, in order to convey, with the greater facility, political and other information to the German citizens, a newspaper was published at the establishment. The title of the paper I have not been able to ascertain. It was printed by Anthony Armbruster;1 1 Since the first edition of this work was published, I have been informed that the newspaper here mentioned was the continuation of that published in 1748, and after by Godhart Armbruster. with whom, at that time, Franklin was a silent copartner. The Rev. Dr. William Smith, provost of the college at Philadelphia, was agent for the English society, and had the direction of the press, and of the newspaper. Formal complaints having been made to the house of assembly respecting the official conduct of William Moore, president of the court of common pleas for the county of Chester, the assembly applied to the governor to remove him from office. Moore, in his vindication, presented "a humble address "to the governor, which was expressed in terms that proved offensive to the assembly. It was published both in the Gazette and in the Journal; and application was made to Dr. Smith to publish a German translation of it in the German newspaper, with which he complied. The house of assembly considered this address as a high reflection on the proceedings of their body, and resolved that "it was a libel." The assembly were desirous of discovering the author of the German translation. They were suspicious of Dr. Smith. The three printers of newspapers, and several other persons, were summoned to give their testimony before the assembly. Hall and Bradford, printers of the English newspapers, knew nothing of the German translation, and were dismissed. Armbruster was interrogated, and committed to the custody of the sergeant at arms, for a contempt to the house in prevaricating in his testimony, and refusing to answer a question put to him; but he was the next day discharged, on his asking pardon, giving direct answers, and paying fees. The Rev. Dr. Smith, the editor of the German paper, and Judge Moore, were on the 6th of January, 1758, apprehended and brought before the house. Moore was charged by the assembly with mal-administration in his office as a magistrate, and with writing and publishing the address. In respect to the first charge, he denied the jurisdiction of the house; at the same time declaring his desire to obtain an impartial hearing before the governor, the usual tribunal in such cases; or, before a court of justice, where he could be acquitted or condemned by his peers. To the second charge he acknowledged that he wrote and published the address to the governor, arid claimed a right to do it. He was imprisoned for refusing to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the house, and for writing the address. Dr. Smith was also committed for printing and publishing the address, although he pleaded "that the same thing had been done four weeks before by Franklin &amp; Hall, printers to the house, in the Pennsylvania Gazette; and, afterwards, by Bradford, printer of the Pennsylvania Journal; neither of whom had been molested." The house, by two resolves, fixed the nature of the crime, and their own authority to try it. Smith, before he left the house, offered to appeal to the king in council; but this was not taken notice of by the assembly. It was intimated to Smith, that he could escape confinement only by making satisfactory acknowledgement to the house; to this he replied, "that he thought it his duty to keep the Dutch press as free as any other press in the province; and, as he was conscious of no offence against the house, his lips should never give his heart the lie; there being no punishment, which they could inflict, half so terrible to him as the thought of forfeiting his veracity and good name with the world." He spoke more to the same purpose, which was so highly approved by a large audience that on that occasion had crowded into the hall of the assembly, as to produce a burst of applause. Some gentlemen who gave this token of their approbation, were taken into custody, examined, reprimanded and discharged. Smith and Moore determined to petition the king for redress.1 1 See American Magazine for January, 1758. See also, Journals of the House of Assembly of Pennsylvania, for 1757 and 1758. This German paper was published about the year 1759, by Weiss and Miller, conveyancers. It was printed for them about two years by Armbruster. In 1762, Anthony Armbruster printed this German paper on his own account, and, in 1764, published it weekly in Arch street. H. Miller's German paper was commenced also in 1762; and for some time there were two German and two English newspapers published in Philadelphia. Der Bochentliche Philadelphische Staatfbote. This newspaper was first published in the German language at Philadelphia, in January, 1762; printed by Henry Miller, with German types, very similar to, though handsomer than English blacks. It was, as occasion required, printed on a whole or half sheet of foolscap; the size of the paper was afterwards enlarged to a crown sheet. The day of publication, at first, was Monday, but it was frequently changed. In 1775, the paper was enlarged to a demy size, and published twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday; in 1776, only once a week, on Tuesdays, at 6s. per annum. In 1765, a cut of a postman on horseback, was introduced into the title; the postman was on a gallop, and held in his left hand a newspaper, on which appeared the word Novœ. In 1768, the title was altered to Pennsnlvanische Staatfbote. In 1775, the cut was omitted, and the paper entitled Genrich Miller's Pennshlvanischer Staatfbote With this alteration in the title, it was printed until the British army took possession of the city in 1777; the publication of it was then suspended, but was revived soon after that army evacuated Philadelphia, and continued till May, 1779, when the publisher retired from business, and his paper was continued by Steiner &amp; Cist, for a few months, and then by Steiner only, until 1794; and after that time by H. &amp; J. Kammerer, and others, until 1812, when it was discontinued. [See Philadelphia—Henry Miller.] James Robertson, who before 1775 printed at Albany, and afterwards at Norwich and New York, published in Philadelphia, whilst the British army occupied the city, a paper entitled The Royal Gazette. Note.—There were 14 newspapers printed in the state of Pennsylvania in 1790, and it was supposed about five times that number in the whole country. The first stage between New York and Philadelphia commenced running in 1756, and occupied three days in the transit. Newspapers were carried in the mail free of charge, until 1758, when, by reason of their great increase, they were charged with postage at 9d. a year for fifty miles, and 18d. for 100 miles.—M. MAGAZINES, &amp;c., PUBLISHED IN PHILADELPHIA BEFORE THE REVOLUTION. The General Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, for all the British Plantations in America. This was published monthly. No. 1 appeared in January, 1741. It has for a frontispiece, the prince of "Wales's coronet and feather, with the motto, Ich Dien. It was published only six months. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed and sold by Benjamin Franklin." 12s. per annum. 12mo. The American Magazine, or a Monthly View of the British Colonies. First published January, 1741. Foolscap 8vo., forty-eight pages. 12s. per annum. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed and sold by Andrew Bradford." This work was edited by, and published for, John Webbe, who having issued the prospectus from the American Mercury of November 6, 1740, gave offence to Benjamin Franklin, and produced a short, but smart paper war between Franklin, Webbe, and Bradford. Webbe had employed Bradford to print the work. Franklin asserted that it had previously been engaged to him. This was contradicted by Webbe; but he acknowledged that he had conversed with Franklin on the subject, who had given to him, in writing, the terms on which he would print and publish it. The consequence was, that Franklin began the magazine above mentioned, and published it a month sooner than Webbe could bring his forward. I cannot find that Bradford and Webbe printed more than two numbers of this work. The American Magazine, or Monthly Chronicle for the British Colonies. By a Society of Gentlemen. Veritatis Cultores Fraudis Inimici. This Magazine was first published in October, 1757. Imprint, "Philadelphia: Printed by William Bradford." Price 12s. per annum. It was discontinued soon after the appearance of The New American Magazine, printed in January, 1758, by Parker, and edited by Nevil, at Woodbridge. I cannot find that Bradford published more than three numbers. The Penny Post. This was a small work of a few pages 12 mo. published for a short time by Benjamin Mecom, in 1769. I have not seen a copy of it. His design was to print it weekly; but it came from the press in an irregular manner. The American Magazine, Was published monthly, through the year 1769, for its author Lewis Nicola; each number contained forty-eight pages. To this magazine were subjoined the transactions of the American Philosophical Society, of which Nicola was a member. The work was begun and ended with the year. It was printed in octavo, price 13s. per annum. Nicola was born at Rochelle, in France, and educated in Ireland. He had some appointment in the British army, but quitted it. He was the author of one or more small military treatises, written about the commencement of our revolution, to which he was friendly. He obtained military rank in Pennsylvania, and eventually became a general officer in the militia. The Royal Spiritual Magazine, or the Christian's Grand Treasury. This work was begun in 1771, and published monthly, for a few months only, by John MacGibbons, in Front street, between Arch and Race streets. The Pennsylvania Magazine, or American Monthly Museum. This Magazine was first published in January, 1775, by Robert Aitken. The celebrated Thomas Paine, author of Common Sense,1 1 There was a political paper published in London, in 1739, which I have seen, that bears the title Common Sense. &amp;c., was one of the principal compilers and writers of the Museum. It was a work of merit; each number contained forty-eight pages, octavo, with an engraving. The war put an end to it. Aitken contracted with Paine to furnish, monthly, for this work, a certain quantity of original matter; but he often found it difficult to prevail on Paine to comply with his engagement. On one of the occasions, when Paine had neglected to supply the materials for the Magazine, within a short time of the day of publication, Aitken went to his lodgings, and complained of his neglecting to fulfil his contract. Paine heard him patiently, and coolly answered, "You shall have them in time." Aitken expressed some doubts on the subject, and insisted on Paine's accompanying him and proceeding immediately to business, as the workmen were waiting for copy. He accordingly went home with Aitken, and was soon seated at the table with the necessary apparatus, which always included a glass, and a decanter of brandy. Aitken remarked, "he would never write without that." The first glass put him in a train of thinking; Aitken feared the second would disqualify him, or render him untractable; but it only illuminated his intellectual system; and when he had swallowed the third glass, he wrote with great rapidity, intelligence, and precision; and his ideas appeared to flow faster than he could commit them to paper. What he penned from the inspiration of the brandy, was perfectly fit for the press without any alteration, or correction.1 1 Aitken was a man of truth, and of an irreproachable character. This anecdote came from him some years before his death. Paine, when he edited the Magazine for Aitken, was suspected of toryism. GERMANTOWN. A public journal was printed in the German language at Germantown, as early as the summer of 1739, by Christopher Sower.2 2 This person was a native of Germany, born 1793, and immigrated 1724. He wrote his name Saur (pronounced sour), for which reason, it is probable, his son altered the orthography of his own name to Sower. For a particular description of Saur and his enterprises, Simpson's Eminent Philadelphians, 902; Printer's Circular, VII, 356; O'Callaghan's List of American Bibles, passim.—M. The title of it in English, was, The Pennsylvania German Recorder of Events.3 3 This paper was entitled Der Pennshlvanische Seschict Schreiber oder Sammlung wichtiger Hachrichten and Sem Hatur-und Airchen-Heich, signifying in English, the High-Dutch Pennsylvania Historiographer, or collection of Impartial Intelligence from the Kingdoms of Nature and the Church. Saur designed it to serve as a journal for the sect of Tunkers, with whom he was identified, and at first published it only occasionally on one side of a sheet for gratuitous distribution. It took a more definite form in 1736, as a folio, 9 by 13 inches. See Printer's Circular, VII, 356.—M. At first this paper was printed quarterly, at three shillings per annum; it was afterward published monthly, and continued for several years. This was, undoubtedly, the first newspaper printed in the German language in America. Germantanner Zeitung (Germantown Gazette). This Gazette was printed by Christopher Sower, jun., and, probably, as a substitute for the Germantown Recorder, which had been published by his father. It was a weekly paper, and commenced about 1744. As an appendage to it, Sower for some time published, every fortnight, a small magazine of eight 8vo. pages, containing, chiefly, moral and religious essays; with which, it is said, he, for some time, supplied his newspaper customers gratis. It was entitled Sin Seistliches Magazin.1 1 For a more correct account of this work see Simpson's Eminent Philadelphians, 903–4, note.—M. The Zeitung was continued until the troubles occasioned by the revolutionary war obliged the publisher to drop it. It had an extensive circulation among the Germans settled in Pennsylvania. Its publication was continued till 1748. LANCASTER. A newspaper in the English and German languages was published in Lancaster, by Miller and Holland, in January, 1751. What the title of it was I cannot learn, nor the time at which it was discontinued. Francis Bailey, it is said, published a paper in English soon after the beginning of the war, but this fact is doubted by some. He afterwards removed to Philadelphia, in 1778, and there published the Freeman's Journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DELAWARE. The district of country which composes the state of Delaware, was, previously to the revolution, distinguished as "The Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, on Delaware." WILMINGTON. The first and only newspaper published before 1775, in what is now the state of Delaware, made its appearance in Wilmington about the year 1762, entitled, if my information is correct, The Wilmington Courant, printed and published by James Adams, for the short period of six months; when, for want of encouragement, it was discontinued. About the year 1787, Adams commenced the publication of another paper, entitled The Wilmington Courant. Its continuance was only two or three years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARYLAND. A newspaper was published at Annapolis, in this colony, as early as 1728. Three papers only had been printed before the revolutionary war, and two of them were published when it commenced. The Maryland Gazette. I cannot determine the exact time when this paper was first introduced to the public; but the best information I can obtain dates its origin from 1727. I have ascertained that it was published in June, 1728, by the following record of the vestry of the parish church in Annapolis, dated in June, 1728, directing "the register of the vestry to apply to the printer to have an advertisement inserted in the Maryland Gazette;" and, by a subsequent record of an account "rendered by the Printer for publishing an advertisement in the Gazette, and printing hand-bills." These and other facts indicate that it was established the previous year; and I have reason to believe that it was published irregularly until 1736. I have seen extracts from it dated in August, 1729. It was printed by William Parks. The Maryland Gazette. This was the second newspaper published in the colony. The first had been discontinued about nine years, when the second of the same title came before the public in April, 1745, printed by Jonas Green. It was published weekly, on Thursday, on paper of foolscap size, folio, but it was enlarged, some years after, to a crown sheet. The typographical features of this Gazette were equal to those of any paper then printed on the continent. It has been regularly and uniformly published from 1745, to the present time (1810), with the exception of a short suspension in 1765, on account of the stamp act; and there is only one paper printed in the United States which is of prior date. After it had been published several years, the imprint was as follows: "Annapolis: Printed by Jonas Green, at his Printing-Office in Charles-Street; where all persons may be supplied with this Gazette, at 12∫6. a year; and Advertisements of a moderate Length are inserted for 5s. the First Week, and 1s. each Time after: And long ones in Proportion." When the publication of this Gazette was suspended on account of the stamp act in 1765, its printer occasionally issued a paper called The Apparition of the Maryland Gazette, which is not Dead but Sleepeth. At one corner of the sheet of The Apparition was, as a substitute for a stamp, the figure of a death's head, about which the words following were thus arranged: The Times are Dismal, [Death's Head.] Doleful, Dolorous, Dollar-less. The publication of The Maryland Gazette was resumed January 30th, 1766, and it was printed until 1767; completing a period of twenty-two years by Green, the first publisher. From April 1767 to December of that year, it was issued from the press by his widow, Anne Catharine Green; and from January 1768 to August 1770, by Anne Catharine Green and William her son. William died in 1770; and Anne Catharine published it until her death, in March, 1775. It was then continued by her sons, Frederic and Samuel Green.1 1 Both Frederic and Samuel Green paid the debt of nature not long after the first edition of this work was published. The St. Mary's Gazette announced in 1848, that it was printed on the press used in printing this Maryland Gazette, which had been in constant use for more than a hundred years, and upon which the first edition of the Laws of Maryland was printed.—M. BALTIMORE. The Maryland Journal; and Baltimore Advertiser. Containing the freshest Advices both Foreign and Domestick. "Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile dulci, Lectorem delectando, pariterque moncndo." Hor. This was the third newspaper published in Maryland, and first appeared in August, 1773. It was handsomely printed on a demy sheet, and had a cut of the arms of the colony, or those of lord Baltimore, in the title. At first it was published on Saturdays, afterward on Thursdays. Imprint, "Baltimore: Printed by William Goddard, at the Printing-Office in Market-street, opposite the Coffee-House, where Subscriptions, at Ten Shillings per Annum, Advertisements and Letters of Intelligence, are gratefully received for this paper; and where all Manner of Printing Work is performed with Care, Fidelity and Expedition. Blanks and Hand-Bills in particular are done on the shortest Notice in a neat and correct Manner." From 1775, to 1784, Mary Katharine Goddard, in the absence of her brother, published the Journal in her own name. In the year 1784, William Goddard resumed the publication. During several years Goddard was in habits of intimacy and friendship with the celebrated but eccentric general, Charles Lee, who, in one stage of the American war, was the second in command of the American army; and, it is supposed, contemplated the removal of General Washington from the chief command, with an expectation of occupying his place. Lee having failed in the execution of his orders at the battle of Monmouth, in 1778, was disgraced, and spent the remainder of his days in retirement, chiefly on his large estate in Berkeley county, Va., said to have contained 2752 acres of valuable land. He died at Philadelphia, October 2, 1782; and in his last will and testament, as a token of his esteem, left Goddard, as has been mentioned, a valuable real estate in Virginia. Lee's papers were deposited in the hands of Goddard with a view to the publication of them; and, in June 1785, a proposal for printing them by subscription, in three volumes octavo, at the price of one guinea, was issued in the Maryland Journal. The papers consisted, first, of letters to Lee from persons of distinction, both in Europe and America; secondly, letters from the general to his friends in Europe previous to the war, likewise to the principal characters in America, civil and military, during his command in the American army; and thirdly, essays on various subjects, political and military; to which it was proposed to prefix memoirs of his life.1 1 Major General Charles Lee was the son of Colonel John Lee, and a native of Wales. He was allied to several of the most noble, ancient and respectable families in England; and could trace his genealogy from the Norman conquest. As he possessed a military spirit, he entered the army early in life; but the profession of arms did not damp his ardor in the pursuits of literature. He possessed a competent knowledge of Greek and Latin; and, in his travels, formed an acquaintance with the Italian, Spanish, German and French languages. He served against the French in America, anno 1756; and, when General Abercrombie was defeated at the French lines of Ticonderoga in July, 1758, Lee was severely wounded at the head of his grenadiers. He served with great reputation under General Burgoyne in Portugal; and was a volunteer against the Turks in the Russian army, commanded by General Romanzow, where he had some "hair breath 'scapes." He was made a major general in the army of the king of Poland; after which he returned to England, but meeting with disappointments, he retired with some disgust to America, where he became an enthusiast in the cause of liberty. In the contest which ensued between England and her colonies, he took up arms in favor of the latter; by which proceeding he risked his very considerable estate in England, which however escaped confiscation; yet he was deprived of its profits, and was thereby subjected to many difficulties and mortifying privations. He lost also his rank of a major general in the British army, with a very fair chance of becoming a lieutenant general, and, perhaps, of being made a peer of the realm. He was eminently useful in forming and disciplining the American armies, and rendered essential service on many other important occasions. He "adventured his life far," in "many a well fought field;" and did much toward infusing a martial spirit into the American troops. If General Washington was considered as the Fabius, he was called the Marcellus, of the American army; and as he exchanged a life of opulence, wealth and ease, for the toils, dangers and privations of war, we cannot doubt that the affections of his soul were honestly and nobly engaged in the cause of freedom, distinctly and independently of all the principles and motives of ambition. The principal part of the estate which he possessed at the time of his death, he bequeathed to his sister Miss Sidney Lee, who was a lady of exquisite accomplishments, and treated the Americans who were captured, and imprisoned by the British in England, with great humanity. She remitted four thousand five hundred pounds sterling to America, in order to discharge her brother's debts, lest his legatees in this country should be deprived of what his friendship and gratitude induced him to bequeath to them. (For other particulars see Memoirs of General Lee; Allen's American Biography; Historical Collections, &amp;c.) Goddard did not publish the work he had projected; as a person whom he had engaged as an associate in the publication, and who was entrusted with the manuscripts, betrayed his trust; for instead of preparing them for the press, he sent them to England, where they were printed and sold for his sole benefit, and formed the imperfect work, which is entitled Memoirs of the Life of the late Charles Lee. In the prospectus, the publishers observed, "That the greatest task they met with in collecting and arranging these posthumous papers, arose from their desire of not giving offence to such characters as had been the objects of the general's aversion and resentment. Unhappily, his disappointments had soured his temper; the affair of Monmouth, several pieces of scurrility from the press, and numerous instances of private slander and defamation, so far got the better of his philosophy as to provoke him in the highest degree, and he became as it were, angry with all mankind. "To this exasperated disposition we may impute the origin of his Political Queries, and a number of satirical hints, thrown out both in his conversation and writing, against the commander in chief. Humanity will draw a veil over the involuntary errors of sensibility, and pardon the sallies of a suffering mind, as its presages did not meet with an accomplishment. General Washington, by his retirement, demonstrated to the world that power was not his object; that America had nothing to fear from his ambition; but that she was honored with a specimen of such exalted patriotism as could not fail to attract the attention and admiration of the most distant nations. "The reader then will not wonder that General Lee, disappointed in his career of glory, should be continually inculcating an idea of the extreme danger of trusting too much to the wisdom of one, for the safety of the whole; that he should consider it as repugnant to the principles of freedom and republicanism to continue for years one man as commander in chief; that there should be a rotation of office, military as well as civil; and though the commander of an army possessed all the virtues of Cato, and the talents of Julius Cesar, it could not alter the nature of the thing, since by habituating the people to look up to one man, all true republican spirit became enervated, and a visible propensity to monarchical government was created and fostered; that there was a charm in the long possession of high office, and in the pomp and influence that attended it, which might corrupt the best dispositions. "Indeed it was the opinion of Marcus Aurelius, whose virtues not only honored the throne but human nature, that to have the power of doing much, and to confine that power to doing good, was a prodigy in nature. Such sentiments of this divine prince, who was not only trained up in the schools of austere philosophy, but whose elevated situation rendered him the most able judge of the difficulty there is in not abusing extensive power, when we have it in our hands, furnish substantial arguments for not entrusting it to any mortal whatsoever. But while we are convinced of the justness of these sentiments, we are led the more to respect and reverence our most disinterested commander in chief, who stands conspicuous with unrivalled glory, superior to the fascinations which have overthrown many a great and noble mind." Before any further steps were taken toward the publication of this work, Goddard addressed General Washington, in the most respectful manner, giving him the outline of the plan, with assurances that every possible precaution would be taken to avoid injuring either his reputation or his feelings. To this letter the general returned the following answer, which, I believe, has not before been published. Mount Vernon, 11th June, 1785. "Sir, "On the 8th inst. I received the favour of your letter of the 30th of May. In answer to it I can only say, that your own good judgment must direct you in the publication of the manuscript papers of General Lee. I can have no request to make concerning the work. I never had a difference with that gentleman, but on public ground; and my conduct towards him upon this occasion, was only such as I conceived myself indispensably bound to adopt in discharge of the public trust reposed in me. If this produced in him unfavourable sentiments of me, I yet can never consider the conduct I pursued with respect to him, either wrong or improper, however I may regret that it may have been differently viewed by him, and that it excited his censure and animadversions. "Should there appear in General Lee's writings any thing injurious or unfriendly to me, the impartial and dispassionate world must decide how far I deserved it from the general tenor of my conduct. I am gliding down the stream of life, and wish, as is natural, that my remaining days may be undisturbed and tranquil; and, conscious of my integrity, I would willingly hope that nothing will occur to give me anxiety; but should any thing present itself in this or in any other publication, I shall never undertake the painful task of recrimination, nor do I know that I shall even enter upon my justification. "I consider the communication you have made, as a mark of great attention, and the whole of your letter as a proof of your esteem. "I am, Sir, Your most obedt. humble servant, Go. Washington." Mr. Goddard. Goddard continued the Journal, and published it twice a week until August, 1792, and then sold his right to James Angell, who for three years had been his partner. Angell did not publish the Journal a long time, but sold the establishment to Philip Edwards, and soon after died of the yellow fever in Philadelphia. Before 1786, Edward Langworthy was, for a few months, a partner with Goddard in the Journal.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">VIRGINIA. Only two newspapers were published in Virginia before 1775. They were both printed at Williamsburg. The first, which was under the influence of the governor, commenced August, 1736. The second in 1766.1 1 See note on page 331, et seq., volume I. The first public journal printed in the colony was entitled, The Virginia Gazette. It appeared as early as the year 1736, on a half sheet foolscap, and, occasionally, on a whole sheet, printed by William Parks, who continued it until he died, in 1750. Some months after his death the paper was discontinued. The Virginia Gazette. With the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestick. This in fact was but a renewal of the first Gazette, which had been a short time suspended, but it commenced with No. 1. It was published weekly, on Monday, on a crown sheet, folio, neatly printed, and had a cut of the Virginia arms in the title. The first number was published in February, 1751. Imprint, "Williamsburg: Printed by William Hunter, at the Post-Office, by whom persons may be supplied with this paper. Advertisements of a moderate length for Three shillings the first week, and Two shillings each week after." In this Gazette were published, in 1757, many well written essays, under the signature of The Virginia Centinel. Hunter died in 1761. The Gazette was enlarged to a demy size, and published by Joseph Royle; after whose death it was carried on by Purdie and Dixon; who continued it until the commencement of the war; and Purdie alone published it several years during the revolutionary contest. The Virginia Gazette. Published by Authority. Open to all Parties, but influenced by none. This paper was first published in May, 1766, and continued weekly, on Thursday. A cut of the arms of the colony was in the title. It was well printed with new types, on a demy sheet, folio. Imprint, "Williamsburgh: Printed by William Rind, at the New Printing-Office, on the Main Street. All Persons may be supplied with this Gazette at 12∫6. per Year." At the end of the first year, "Published by Authority" was omitted in the head of the Gazette. This paper was published by Rind until his death, which happened on the 19th of August, 1773. Clementina Rind, who was his widow, continued it after he died; and to her succeeded John Pinckney, who also died soon after, and the Gazette was discontinued. Virginia Gazette. This Gazette was first published in April, 1775, and continued weekly, on Saturday, by John Clarkson and Augustine Davis, at Williamsburg, several years. Note.—A paper was printed at Norfolk in 1775, by John Hunter Holt, whose press was carried off by a British force landed from war ships, in the harbor, Sept. 30. See 4 Force's Archives, III, 847, 923, 1031.—M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NORTH CAROLINA. The establishment of three newspapers had been attempted in North Carolina before the revolution. One of these, after the first trial, was discontinued for several years, and then revived. Another was published only three years, between 1763 and 1768, and dropped. The third was begun about 1770, and this, as well as the first, was published when the war commenced.1 1 In Lossing's Field Book of the Revolution, II, 360, ed. of 1860, we read that James Davis brought the first press into this state from Virginia, in 1749, and printed the first edition of the acts of the assembly; that the first periodical paper was called the North Carolina Magazine, or Universal Intelligencer, which was printed on a demy sheet, in quarto pages, and was filled with long extracts from theological works and British magazines. Mr. Lossing's account of early printing in this state differs materially from that of Mr. Thomas.—M. NEWBERN. The first paper published in the colony was printed at Newbern, under the title of The North Carolina Gazette. With the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. No. 1 appeared in December, 1755, printed on a sheet of pot size, folio, but often on half a sheet. It was published weekly, on Thursday. Imprint, "Newbern: Printed by James Davis, at the Printing-Office in Front-Street; where all persons may be supplied with this paper at Sixteen Shillings per Annum: And where Advertisements of a moderate length are inserted for Three Shillings the first Week, and Two Shillings for every week after. And where also Book-Binding is done reasonably." This paper was published about six years, after which it was discontinued. On the 27th of May, 1768, it again appeared, numbered one, and enlarged to a crown sheet, folio; the imprint, after the title, was: "Printed by James Davis, at the Post Office in Newbern." The price of Advertisements, and the paper per annum, the same as in 1755. It was continued after the commencement of the war. WILMINGTON. A newspaper was published in this place about the year 1764. I am not certain respecting the title of it, but if I recollect aright, it was The Cape-Fear Gazette and Wilmington Advertiser.1 1 Mr. Lossing says it was called the North Carolina Gazette and Weekly Post Boy; that the first number was printed in September, 1764.—M. A small cut of the king's arms was in the title. This Gazette was printed on a sheet of pot, on pica and long primer types, by Andrew Steuart, who styled himself "Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty." It was discontinued before or during the year 1767. The Cape-Fear Mercury. "Quod verum atque decens curo et rogo, et Omnis in hoc Sum." The Mercury was first published October 13, 1769.1 1 Lossing says, Oct. 1767. It was printed weekly, on Friday, on paper of crown size, with pica and long primer types. A cut of the king's arms was in the title. The imprint was long and singular, viz: "Boyd's Printing-Office in Wilmington, Cape-Fear, where this Paper may be had every Friday at the Rate of 16 s. a year, one half to be paid at the time of Subscribing, or at 8 s. every six months. Subscriptions for this Paper are taken in by Gentlemen in most of the adjacent Counties, and by A. Boyd, who has for sale sundry Pamphlets and Blanks; Also: Epsom and Glauber Salts by the lb. or larger quantity. N.B. Advertisements of a moderate Length will be inserted at 4 s. Entrance, and 1 s. a Week Continuance: Those of an immoderate Length to pay in proportion." This paper was badly printed; and although destitute of system in the arrangement of its contents, it was, I believe, continued until 1775.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOUTH CAROLINA. The publication of a newspaper was not attempted in this colony till the year 1732. CHARLESTON. The first newspaper published in the Carolinas, made its appearance in this city January 8, 1731–2, printed by Thomas Whitmarsh.1 1 There is an indication that Eleazer Phillips, Jr., printed the first paper in Charleston. We learn from King's Newspaper Press of Charleston that Phillips died in July, 1732, and that his father advertised nearly two years after, for settlement of debts due the former for six months subscriptions to the South Carolina Weekly Journal, a paper which is not named in any of the early records of the press, and of which no other trace can be found. It will be seen by reference to the first volume of this work, p. 340, that Phillips was the first printer in the colony.—M. It bears the title of The South-Carolina Gazette. Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick. "Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile dulci. Lectorem delectando, pariterque monendo".    Hor. It was published on Saturdays, through that year, and, as circumstances required, on a sheet or half sheet of paper, pot size, but soon after was discontinued, on account of the sickness and death of its publisher. See Appendix M. Imprint, "Charles-Town: Printed by T. Whitmarsh, at the Sign of the Table Clock on the Bay. Where Advertisements are taken in, and all Persons may be supplied with this Paper at Three Pounds1 1 Equal to two dollars. a Year." The South Carolina Gazette. After the Gazette published by Whitmarsh had been discontinued some months, another paper with the same title was, in February 1734, begun by Lewis Timothy. This gained a permanency. It was published weekly, on Saturdays, printed on a half sheet of paper of pot size, but sometimes on a whole sheet, and often on a type as large as english, and at other times on long primer. Price 15s. currency, per quarter. Timothy died about the year 1738, and the paper was continued by his widow for a short time, with the aid of her son. The son, in 1740, published it on his own account. His imprint was, "Charles-Town: Printed by Peter Timothy, in King-street, where Advertisements are taken in. Price 15s. a Quarter."Some years after, it was printed "in Broad-Street." The size of this Gazette was enlarged from time to time, until the year 1760, when it was printed on a sheet of the size of medium, four columns in a page; and a cut of the king's arms was added to the title. The day of publication was changed to Monday; but it seldom made its appearance on that day. No mail was then established between the southern and northern colonies, and the Gazette depended on the arrival of vessels from distant ports for supplies of intelligence. The publisher often waited several days for arrivals; but the Gazette dated Monday was always issued within the week. The publication was interrupted a few weeks in 1765, at the time the British stamp act was to take place. The Gazette had a large number of advertising customers; and it was ably conducted. It supported the cause of the country, and energetically opposed the measures of the British administration. In 1772, this Gazette was printed by Thomas Powell, who continued it two or three years, at Timothy's printing house. Powell, during this time, accounted to Timothy, the proprietor, for a certain proportion of the proceeds. About May, 1775, the Gazette was discontinued; but it was revived by Timothy in April, 1777, when the title was altered to The Gazette of the State of South-Carolina. Timothy conducted this paper until the city was about to be surrendered to the British in 1780, when it was again suspended, and the publisher became a prisoner of war. After the restoration of the city, Timothy being dead, his widow, Anne Timothy, revived the Gazette, and from December, 1782, published it twice a week, on Monday and Thursday, until her death, which took place in 1792. On the death of Anne Timothy, the Gazette was published by her son, Benjamin Franklin Timothy, who soon took a partner, and the Gazette appeared under the title of The South-Carolina State Gazette, and Timothy and Mason's Daily Advertiser. "Printed at the corner of Bay and Broad Streets." When the partnership of Timothy and Mason was dissolved, the Gazette was printed by B. F. Timothy until 1800. In that year the publication of it finally ceased. B. F. Timothy died in 1804. [See Peter Timothy,1 1 Peter Timothy Marchant, great grandson of Lewis Timothy, was in 1807 and 1808, one of the members of the house of Marchant, Willington &amp; Co., editors of The Charleston Courier. I, 342; Thomas Powell, I, 345.] The South-Carolina and American General Gazette. This paper was first published in 1758, by Robert Wells. It was printed on a medium sheet, four columns in a page; the day assigned for the publication was Friday, but although so dated, it did not regularly appear, but was at times delayed several days; it was published, however, without intermission once in a week. It had a cut of the king's arms in the title; and, some time after its first publication, the following motto from Horace was adopted: "Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri." Imprint, Charlestown: Printed by R. Wells and G. Bruce, for Robert Wells, at the Great Stationery and Book-Store on the Bay." After this Gazette had been printed a few years by Wells and Bruce, the connection between them was dissolved, and Wells printed and published the paper in his own name, a short intermission excepted when the stamp act of 1765 was to have taken effect, until 1775. Wells being a royalist he went to England soon after the war commenced, and this Gazette was continued by his son John Wells until 1780, when the city fell into the possession of the British; on which event the paper was discontinued, and John printed a Royal Gazette. Very few original essays appeared in The South Carolina and American General Gazette; but while it was published by the senior Wells, the intelligence it contained was judiciously selected, and methodically arranged, and it had a large share of advertisements; for which reason it was often accompanied by an additional half sheet. After the younger Wells became the editor, it supported the cause of the country until about the period when it was discontinued. The South Carolina Gazette, and Country Journal. Containing the freshest Advices, both Foreign and Domestick. This paper was established in opposition to the British American stamp act, November, 1765, and was published without stamps about the time the act was to have taken effect. The title bore a cut of the king's arms. Tuesday was the day of publication, and it was printed on a sheet of demy, folio, from a new bourgeois type. It was often accompanied by a half sheet supplement. Imprint, "Charles-Town: Printed by Charles Crouch at his Office in Eliott-Street, Corner of Gadsden's Alley." The general opposition of the colonies to the stamp act induced the public to patronize this Gazette. It immediately gained a large list of respectable subscribers, and a full proportion of advertising customers. Of the three newspapers printed at that time in Charlestown, this only appeared regularly, on the day it was dated. These papers were all entitled Gazettes, in order to secure certain advertisements, directed by law to be "inserted in the South Carolina Gazette." Crouch published his Gazette till he died in 1775. His widow continued it a short time, but it finally ceased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGIA. SAVANNAH. The Georgia Gazette, Was first published on the 17th of April, 1763, printed on a new long primer type, on a foolscap sheet, folio, two columns in a page, and continued weekly, on Wednesday. Imprint, "Savannah: Printed by James Johnston, at the Printing-Office in Broughton-Street, where Advertisements, Letters of Intelligence, and Subscriptions for this Paper, are taken in.—Hand-Bills, Advertisements, &amp;c., printed on the shortest Notice." After a few years, it was enlarged and printed on a sheet of crown size. The publication of this Gazette was for some time suspended, like that of several others on the continent, when the British American stamp act was to take place in 1765; but it was, at the end of seven months, revived. It reappeared in May, 1766; and, in September of that year, a cut of the king's arms was introduced into the title. It was again suspended for some time during the war. The Gazette was published twenty-seven years by Johnston, and continued by his successors. It was the first and only newspaper published in the colony, before the revolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEW STATES, &amp;c. VERMONT. In February, 1781, the first newspaper printed in Vermont was published at Westminster; it was entitled, The Vermont Gazette or Green Mountain Post-Boy. Motto— "Pliant as Reeds, where streams of Freedom glide; Firm as the Hills, to stem Oppression's Tide. It was printed on a sheet of pot size, and published weekly, on Monday, by Judah Paddock Spooner and Timothy Green. Green resided in New London, and Spooner conducted the Gazette, which was continued only two or three years. In 1810 there were not less than fourteen newspapers in this state, which forty years before was an uncultivated wilderness. After the establishment of peace, the settlement of the uncultivated country progressed with a rapidity unparalleled, perhaps, in history. The press seems to have followed the axe of the husbandman; forests were cleared, settlements made, new states were formed, and gazettes were published. KENTUCKY. A Gazette was first published in this state in September, 1786, by John Bradford, in Lexington. Another newspaper was soon after printed at Frankfort. Others speedily followed in various towns. TENNESSEE. In 1793, R. Roulstone, from Massachusetts, settled at Knoxville; and, in that year, first published The Knoxville Gazette. OHIO. Printing was introduced into this state at Cincinnati in 1795, by S. Freeman &amp; Son; and they published a newspaper. A second newspaper was published at that place in 1799. Then a press was established at Marietta, from which was issued The Ohio Gazette; and, there are now (1810), other newspapers published in the state; particularly two or three at Chillicothe.1 1 The Ohio Patriot, a newspaper published in 1811, contains the following remark, "The progress of population in the state of Ohio is truly astonishing. Large districts of country, extending hundreds of miles, over which one of the editors wandered thirteen years ago, amid the gloom of the groves, without viewing 'the human face divine,' except in the persons of his military companions, or the solitary Indian hunter, are now covered with populous towns, in several of which newspapers are published." MISSISSIPPI TERRITORY. A press has been established at Natchez, and a newspaper published. LOUISIANA. Several newspapers were published in the city of New Orleans, immediately after the country was purchased by the government of the United States. There is now (1810), a press at St. Louis, in Upper Louisiana, at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, at which a newspaper is printed. NOTE. Maine. The first paper printed in this state is said to have been established at Falmouth in 1785 for the purpose of advocating a separation from Massachusetts. It was about the size of a sheet of foolscap, and was made up principally of extracts from other papers, giving dates a fortnight or three weeks old from Boston and New York as the latest intelligence. The printer, whose name is not mentioned, was living in 1842. Michigan. It is stated in the Catholic Almanac of 1871, that Gabriel Richard, a French Catholic priest, was the first person that undertook printing west of the Alleghanies. He printed a paper called the Essai du Michigan in 1809, which seems to have given offense to the British authorities, by whom he was imprisoned. There were undoubtedly earlier printers west of the Alleghanies. Illinois. The Illinois Herald, the first paper in that state, was begun at or before 1809, by Matthew Duncan, at Kaskaskia. It passed soon after under the name of Illinois Intelligencer, and was removed to Vandalia. Mississippi. A paper is said to have been established at Natchez in 1808, but nothing authentic is found concerning it. Missouri. A paper is reported to have been printed at St. Louis, called the Gazette in 1806. Indiana. The Western Sun, the first paper in this territory, was begun at Vincennes in 1808. Wisconsin. The Green Bay Republican was printed by W. Shoals in 1831 or 1832. Arkansas. The first paper in this state is supposed to have been issued in 1834, at Little Rock. Iowa had a paper at Burlington in 1836. Texas. The Galveston Star was commenced in 1834. California. It was not till 1848 that a paper was begun on a small sheet at San Francisco, called Alta California. Oregon. A paper called The Freeman was begun at Columbia in 1847. Minnesota. S. Randall began to publish The Register at St. Paul in 1849.—M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BRITISH COLONIES, ON THE CONTINENT. NOVA SCOTIA. This colony continues to be a part of British America. The settlement of the chief town of the colony, Halifax, commenced in 1749, at the expense of the British government. The first press established in the province was in 1750. HALIFAX. Soon after the commencement of the settlement of this town, printing was introduced, and a newspaper published with the title of The Halifax Gazette. It first appeared in January, 1752, and was printed weekly, on half a sheet of foolscap paper, by John Bushell, from Boston. The circulation of the Gazette was in a great measure confined to the town, which was then a mere garrison. After a trial of some months the publication of it was for a long time suspended; at length it was revived, but not issued at regular periods till about the autumn of 1760; which was soon after Bushell died. Anthony Henry commenced the republication of this Gazette in 1761. His first paper was marked No. 1, and a cut was placed at each end of the title; the one on the right appeared to be designed for a fowler pursuing game; that on the left was a ship. He continued to print it weekly, on Thursday, in a very indifferent manner, and with few customers, until 1765, when the British stamp act was enforced in the colony.1 1 The stamp act took effect in Nova Scotia, Canada and the Floridas, on the continent; and in the islands of Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antigua and Grenada. It was then printed on stamped paper. Not more than seventy copies were issued weekly from the press. The subscribers did not amount to that number. The Gazette had been printed on a half sheet; but after the stamp act went into operation, it appeared on a whole one, because there was only one stamp on a sheet. Not more than six or eight reams of stamped paper, of the sort appropriated to newspapers, had been sent from England for the colony; the whole of which came into the possession of Henry, and in a few weeks it was expended; or rather the stamps were, unknown to him, by the assistance of a binder's press and plough, cut from the paper; and the Gazette appeared without the obnoxious stamp, and was again reduced to half a sheet. The imprint when printed on a stamped sheet, was—"Halifax, (in Nova-Scotia); Printed and Sold by A. Henry, at his Printing-Office in Sackville-Street, where all persons may be supplied with a whole Sheet Gazette, at Eighteen Shillings [three dollars and sixty cents] a year, until the publisher has 150 Subscribers, when it will be no more than Twelve Shillings, Advertisements are taken in and inserted as cheap as the Stamp-Act will allow." In 1766, another newspaper was published in the place, handsomely printed and well edited; but Henry, after a short suspension, continued his Gazette. In 1770, the other paper was discontinued; and, in consequence thereof, Henry obtained an accession of customers. He placed the king's arms in the title of the Gazette, which he altered to The Nova Scotia Gazette and the Weekly Chronicle. The size of the paper was enlarged, and the typography was much improved. The publication ceased in 1800, on the death of the printer. The Nova Scotia Gazette. This paper was first published August 15, 1766. It was handsomely printed, weekly, on a crown sheet, folio, on a new long primer type. The day of publication was Thursday. Imprint, "Halifax: Printed by Robert Fletcher, and Sold by him at his Shop near the Parade; where all Sorts of Printing is executed neatly, correctly and expeditiously. Subscriptions received at Twelve Shillings1 1 Two dollars and forty cents. a Year, or Three Pence a Paper. Advertisements of a moderate Length inserted at Three Shillings2 2 Sixty cents. each." This Gazette was printed until 1770, when the publisher who came from England, returned to that country, and the paper was discontinued. No other newspaper was published in Nova Scotia till after the war commenced. CANADA. Only one newspaper was published in Canada before 1775. In 1791, this territory was divided, and another province formed, distinguished by the name of Upper Canada. There are now (1810) several newspapers printed in that part which is called Lower Canada, and one or more in the new province. QUEBEC. The Quebec Gazette, La Gazette de Quebec, Was first published in January, 1765, printed in English and French, on a sheet of foolscap, folio, but afterwards enlarged to a crown size, two columns to a page, the first in English, the second, containing the same matter, in French. A very handsome cut of the king's arms appeared in the title. It was published weekly, on Thursday. Imprint, "Quebec; Printed by Brown &amp; Gilmore, at the Printing-Office in Parlour-Street, in the Upper Town, a little above the Bishop's Palace. Advertisements of a moderate Length (in one Language) inserted at five Shillings, Halifax, the first Week, and one Shilling each Week after; if in both Languages, Seven Shillings and Six Pence, Halifax,1 1 One shilling equal to twenty cents. the first Week, and half a Dollar each Week after." Then followed an imprint in French of the same import. The Gazette was discontinued a short time on account of the stamp act, in 1765. In 1774, this paper was published by William Brown only, the senior partner, at his printing house "behind the Cathedral Church." After the death of Brown, it was continued by his nephew Samuel Neilson, who died, and was succeeded by John Neilson, "in Mountain-street," who now (1810), continues the Gazette. MONTREAL. A newspaper in the French language entitled Gazette du Commerce et Litteraire, Pour la Ville et District de Montreal, was first published in that city, June 3, 1778, by Fleury Mesplet &amp; Charles Berger. It was printed on half a sheet of crown, quarto, with a new bourgeois type. Imprint, " Montreal, Chas. F. Mesplet &amp; C. Berger, Imprimeurs et Libraires." The partnership did not long exist; in September following, the title was altered to "Gazette Litteraire, pour la Ville, &amp;c.," and published by Mesplet only, who continued it until he died. Le Roi succeeded Mesplet, and published the paper a short time. Edward Edwards, after the death of Le Roi, conducted it until the year 1808, when it was discontinued. Other newspapers have been published since 1775, in Quebec and in Montreal; some of which have attained a permanent establishment. A Gazette has lately been established at York, in Upper Canada.1 1 The Canadian Antiquarian &amp; Numismatic Journal of October, 1872, has an article on "The first printing establishment of Montreal," in which the first newspaper is called La Gazette de Montreal."—H. NEW BRUNSWICK. Newspapers were not printed in this province until the year 1783; two or three then issued from the presses of those printers who, during the war, were with the British army in New York, &amp;c., but who, when peace was established, left the United States and settled at St. John, the chief town of New Brunswick. I do not know of more than one Gazette now (1810) published in the province.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BRITISH ISLANDS. JAMAICA. A printing press was established on this island about 1720; and within one or two years after a newspaper was published at Kingston. The Weekly Jamaica Courant. This paper was published at Kingston as early as August, 1722, and as late as 1755, on a sheet of demy, folio; but the exact time at which the publication commenced or closed, I cannot ascertain. The Kingston Journal. The Journal was published weekly, on Saturday. In 1756, it was printed on a sheet of medium, folio, by Woolhead; and, in 1761, by Woolhead, Gad and Bennett, "Printers to the Hon. Council in Harbour-Street." The Jamaica Gazette. This Gazette made its appearance as early as 1745. In 1760, it was printed weekly, on Saturday, on medium, folio. John Walker, one of the proprietors, died in 1786. C. S. Woodham had a printing house in Kingston in 1756, and published an Almanac and Register annually. The St. Jago Intelligencer. The Intelligencer was first "printed at St. Jago de la Vega,"1 1 Columbus was created duke of St. Jago, and marquis of the island of Jamaica.—St. Mery's Hist. of St. Domingo. about 1756, and was published weekly on Saturday. In 1768, Lawry and Sherlock were the printers of it, the size medium, folio. "Price per annum Thirty Shillings, currency, and Two Pistoles sent by post to any part of the island." The Cornwall Chronicle, and Jamaica General Advertiser. The Chronicle first issued from the press May 29, 1773; and was published weekly, on Saturday, "at Montego-Bay," by Sherlock &amp; Co. The size was medium, folio. In 1781, and from that time to 1806, it was printed by James Fannin; who died in England in 1808. The Royal Gazette. This paper first came before the public in 1778. It was published by Douglas &amp; Aikman until 1784, when it was "Printed by Alexander Aikman, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, at the King's Printing-office in Harbour-Street, Kingston." The royal arms were in the centre of the title, and it was very handsomely printed on a medium sheet, quarto. I have mentioned this paper although the publication commenced after 1775, in order to mark the devotion of it to royalty; the printer was no republican. In May, 1786, he advertised in The Royal Gazette, The Royal Almanack, The Royal Register, and The Royal Sheet Almanack; "all printed at the royal press, and sold at the King's Printing-Office in Kingston." David Douglas, a Scotchman, was manager of the American theatre before the revolution;1 1 The revolutionary war closed the theatres on this part of the continent. The players were few in number, and formed only two companies under the management of Douglas and Hallam. Douglas was for some years the principal manager both on the continent and in the West Indies. In 1758, he, with his company, called The American Company of Comedians, performed for the first time at New York in a sail loft, on Cruger's wharf, to an audience said to have been very brilliant. The theatres before 1775, were temporary wooden buildings, little better than barns. The first play publicly performed in New England, was by Douglas and his company at Providence, Rhode Island, in 1762. and after the commencement of hostilities, he came to Jamaica. He was a scholar, and a man of talents and integrity. Here he was patronized hy the governor, and appointed with Aikman printer to the king, in Jamaica, a lucrative office; he was also appointed master in chancery, and commissioned as a magistrate. It has been said, that in a few years he acquired, with reputation, by these offices, a fortune of twenty-five thousand pounds sterling. He died in Spanishtown in 1786. BARBADOES. Printing was introduced to this island as early as 1730, and a newspaper was first published in 1731. There was no other press in the Caribbee islands for several years subsequent to that period. David Harry. It is supposed that David Harry was the first who opened a printing house on the island. He served his apprenticeship, as we have elsewhere mentioned, with Keimer at Philadelphia, and succeeded him in business; but he left that city, and removed to Barbadoes with his press about the year 1730. At Bridgetown, Harry found Keimer, and obtained his assistance in the printing house; so that, as Dr. Franklin remarks, "the master became the journeyman of his former apprentice." Business, it seems, did not suit Harry better in Barbadoes than in Philadelphia; on the contrary, he became more dissipated, and his profits from printing were not equal to his expenditures. In a few months he sold his printing materials, and returned to Philadelphia. [See vol. I, pp. 240–41.] Samuel Keimer, to whom Benjamin Franklin was several years a journeyman in Philadelphia, removed from that city to this island. He sold his press and types to Harry before he left Philadelphia. Harry then sold them to Keimer, as has been stated, who resumed business, and published a newspaper at Bridgetown in 1731, entitled, The Barbadoes Gazette. This was the first newspaper published in the Caribbee islands, and the first known to have been published twice a week, for any considerable time, in any part of America. This, however, finally became a weekly journal. It was continued by Keimer until the end of 1738; and he soon after died. The Gazette was published many years after his death by those who succeeded to his business. In 1733 Keimer was presented by the grand jury of the island for publishing, in the Barbadoes Gazette, a defamatory libel on Mr. Adams, one of the king's council. The attorney general, on that occasion, declared that there was not anything in the publication complained of, which could justify a prosecution under the criminal law, yet Keimer was bound to keep the peace during six months.1 1 Poyer's History of Barbadoes. A work was published in London in 1741, in two volumes quarto, chiefly selected from this Gazette, entitled, Caribbeana; a Collection of Essays, &amp;c., "from a paper carried on several years at Barbadoes." Franklin has informed us that Keimer was a poet. I have met with one of his poetical essays in the Barbadoes Mercury, and insert it as a specimen of his poetical talents, and for the information it contains respecting the encouragement given in his time to the typographic art by the colonial government on this continent. It is as follows: From the Barbados Gazette of May 4, 1734. "To those wou'd-be thought gentlemen, who have long taken this paper, and never paid for it, and seem never to design to pay for it. "The Sorrowful Lamentation of Samuel Keimer, Printer of the Barbados Gazette. What a pity it is that some modern Bravadoes, Who dub themselves Gentlemen here in Barbadoes, Should, Time after Time, run in Debt to their Printer, And care not to pay him in Summer or Winter! A Saint by the Hairs of his Beard, had he got 'em, Might be tempted to swear [instead of P—x rot 'em.] He ne'er found before such a Parcel of Wretches, With their Flams, and such Shuffles, Put-offs and odd Fetches. If This is their Honesty, That be their Honour, Amendment seize One; for the Last,—Fie upon her. In Penn's1 1 Pennsylvania. Wooden Country, Type feels no disaster, Their Printer is rich, and is made their post-master;2 2 Andrew Bradford, of Philadelphia. His Father,3 3 William Bradford of New-York. a Printer, is paid for his Work, And wallows in Plenty, just now at New-York, Tho' quite past his Labour, and old as my Grannum, The Government pays him Pounds Sixty per Annum. In Maryland's Province, as well as Virginia To Justice and Honour, I am, Sirs to win ye, Their Printer1 1 William Parks, who printed for both colonies. Im sure can make it appear, Each Province allows two Hundred a Year, By Laws they have made for Typograph's Use, He's paid 50 Thousand Weight Country Produce. And if you inquire but at South Carolina,2 2 Lewis Timothy then printed for the government of South Carolina. [O! Methinks in that Name, there is something-Divine-Ah!] Like Patriots they've done what to Honor redounds, They gave him (their Currency) 50 Score Pounds. E'en Type at Jamaica, our Island's reproach, Is able to ride in her Chariot or Coach;3 3 This expression seems to imply that the printer in Jamaica at that time was a female. But alas your poor Type prints no Figure;—like Nullo, Curs'd, cheated, abus'd by each pitiful Fellow. Tho' working like Slave, with Zeal and true Courage, He can scarce get as yet ev'n Salt to his Porridge. The Reason is plain; Those act by just Rules— But here knaves have bit him, all MAC-abite Fools. George Esmand &amp; Company. This firm in 1762 opened a second Printing house at Bridgetown, and began the publication of The Barbadoes Mercury. It was published weekly, on Saturday; printed with long primer types, on a crown sheet, folio. Imprint, "Bridge-Town, Printed by George Esmand and Comp. at the new Printing-Office, in Back-Church-Street. Price one Pistole per Annum." The memorable stamp act took effect in this island in 1765, and the Mercury was printed on stamped paper. In 1771, the firm was Esmand &amp; Walker. George Esmand died in November, 1771, and William Walker in February, 1773. The Mercury was continued after the year, 1794. ST. CHRISTOPHER. Printing was brought to this island as early as 1746, and may have been introduced two or three years sooner. There were two printing houses established before 1775. Thomas Howe. He probably was the first printer, and settled at Basseterre. Howe printed the laws, and did other work for government; and, in 1747, published The St. Christopher Gazette. This paper was continued until after the year 1775. Howe was a native of Ireland, and lived to old age. Samuel Jones was a printer and postmaster at Basseterre before 1757, and published a newspaper. He died in London in 1762, after an illness of eight days, of inflammation of the lungs. Edward Dubson, printed after Jones, and was in business after 1767, at Basseterre. Daniel Thibou, had a printing house on this island in 1769, and in that year printed the acts of assembly, from 1711 to 1769. He printed several other works. The St. Christopher Gazette. A second newspaper bearing this title was published at Basseterre. The Gazette printed November 19, 1785, is numbered 693, vol. VII. It then had this imprint, "Basseterre, Saint Christopher, Printed by Edward L. Low in Cayon-Street, No. 84." ANTIGUA. I cannot determine the year when printing was introduced to Antigua, but believe it was about 1748. I have not discovered that any press was erected on this island prior to the time when Benjamin Mecom opened a printing house, about 1748. He has been taken notice of in the course of this work, as a printer in Boston, New Haven and Philadelphia. It was at St. John that he first began business, and published a newspaper, entitled The Antigua Gazette. Mecom continued this publication six or seven years, and then removed to Boston, Massachusetts, his native place. Alexander Shipton, published the Gazette, before and after 1767, which was by him printed weekly, on Wednesday, on a crown sheet, folio, chiefly with small pica types; and had, in the title, a small cut of a basket of flowers. The Antigua Mercury. A newspaper with this title was published in 1769; but how long it was printed before or after that time, I am not able to say.1 1 John Mears printed a well conducted newspaper in St. Johns in 1779, and I am inclined to believe it was the Mercury. DOMINICA. The Freeport Gazette; or, the Dominica Advertiser. Was first published in 1765, at Roseau, by William Smith. It had the king's arms in the title; and was printed weekly, on Saturday, on a fools-cap sheet, and with new long primer and small pica types. In 1767, Smith printed The Shipwreck, "a poem in three parts: By a Sailor, addressed to his Royal Highness the Duke of York. Price Two Dollars." In 1775, a newspaper was published in English and French, by Jones. GRANADA. The Royal Granada Gazette. This paper first appeared at Georgetown in January, 1765, on a crown sheet, folio, printed with new small pica and long primer types, by William Weyland, "at the New Printing-Office." It was published on Saturday and had a cut of the king's arms in the title. There were two printing houses on this island, and one of them was established some years before Weyland's. ST. CROIX. The Royal Danish American Gazette. Was issued from the press at Christiansted before 1770. Printing was not introduced into this island long before the publication of the paper. BERMUDA. The Bermuda Gazette. Was not published until July 1784; but a printing house had a short time before been established at St. George, by J. Stockdale. BAHAMA ISLANDS. The Royal Bahama Gazette. I have introduced this paper, although it was not established till after peace took place on the American continent, in 1783, in order to conclude the account of John Wells, the editor of it, who has been mentioned as a printer in South Carolina, who fled from Charleston when the British army evacuated that city. This paper was printed at Nassau, New Providence. Wells was not contented to remain on the island; but had a strong desire to return to the continent, and had attempted several schemes to effect that purpose which proved unsuccessful. He was still endeavoring to arrange his business in such a manner as to permit him to revisit his native country, which he had left with great reluctance, when he was summoned to the world of spirits. He married at Nassau, and was highly esteemed for his many amiable qualities. [See South Carolina.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRENCH ISLANDS. PORT AU PRINCE. A commercial Gazette was published here by permission, before the revolution in France. or that on the island. In 1790, the paper was published by Bourdon, Printer to the King." Note. In 1804, the prefect of Guadaloupe forbade all American captain under the penalty of $200, to introduce into that colony, any newspapers, gazettes, or proclamations, from any part of the world whatsoever.—M. CAPE FRANÇOIS. A public paper, containing marine intelligence, the orders of government, etc., was published at the royal press at the Cape. When its publication commenced I cannot say, but it was continued in 1790, by permission of the municipality. MARTINICO. "Gazette de la Martinique," commenced its publication in December, 1784. It was printed at St. Pierre, by Pierre Richard, by the permission of government. At the commencement of the revolution in France, presses under no control were set up, not only in the mother country, but in her colonies, from which were issued public journals of various kinds. The following appeared at Martinico, viz: The Friend of Liberty and the Enemy of Licentiousness, published by Thounens &amp; Vauchet in 1791. Gazette National and Political, from the press of J. B. Thounens, in Saint Pierre, Printer to the People. In 1793, Thounens called himself Printer to the Committee of Safety, and to the Patriotic Society. Literary and Political Advertiser of Martinique, printed in Port Royal by P. Richard &amp; La Cadie. These printers then published the Gazette de Martinique in Saint Pierre. In Trinity, on this island, in 1792, appeared a public journal from the press of X. Y. Z.1 1 Part of the above is extracted from the minutes of the Rev. Mr. Bentley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPANISH AMERICA. The number of gazettes printed in the Spanish provinces cannot be ascertained. It has been mentioned that a gazette was printed at Mexico early in the eighteenth century;1 1 Vol. 1, page 6. another was established at Lima, at an early period; and, it has likewise been remarked that a press was long since set up in the Spanish part of Saint Domingo,2 2 Vol. 1, page 8. &amp;c. In May 1807, a printing house was opened with much ceremony at Montevideo, on the river La Plata, in South America, when it was in the possession of the British fleet and army. The first printing performed at the press in that place was the prospectus of a gazette. The commander in chief, the admiral, and other principal officers of the province were present. The first sheet from the press was presented to the governor, the second to the admiral, and so on according to their rank. William Scollay, a young gentleman from Boston, educated at the university of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was appointed conductor of the press and the editor of the gazette, for which he received a very liberal salary.3 3 Printing was introduced into Rio Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, in 1813.—M. A few years later, presses were established, and gazettes published under the control of government, in most of the principal cities of Spain, in America, both on the continent and on the islands. A number of presses, issuing public journals, were also introduced by the revolutionists in the interior of the extensive territories of Spain on this continent. CUBA. Three public papers are now (1810) published at Havana, on this island, weekly, under the titles following: El Aviso de la Habana, Papel Periodico, Literario-Economico. Aurora, Correo Politico-Economico de la Habana. Mensagero, Politico Economico-Literario de la Habana. These, like the Spanish and Portuguese gazettes of Europe, are in small quarto, and commonly on half a sheet of pot or crown paper. See Appendix N.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. From the foregoing statement it appears that, from the time when the first public journal was published in the country, viz. in April, 1704, to April 1775, comprising a period of seventy-one years, seventy-eight different newspapers were printed in the British American continental colonies; that during this period, thirty-nine, exactly one-half of that number, had been, occasionally, discontinued; and that thirty-nine continued to be issued from the several establishments at the commencement of the revolution. The papers published in the West Indies are not included in this computation. In the course of thirty-five years, newspaper establishments were, as previously remarked, multiplied in a surprising degree; insomuch, that the number of those printed in the United States in June, 1810, amounted to upwards of three hundred and sixty, as will appear by a list of them in the appendix. A large proportion of the public papers at that date were established, and supported, by the two great contending political parties, into which the people of these states are usually divided; and whose numbers produce nearly an equipollence; consequently, a great augmentation of vehicles for carrying on the political warfare have been found necessary. I cannot conclude what I have written on the subject of public journals, better than by extracting the following pertinent observations on newspapers, from the Rev. Dr. Miller's Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century. "It is worthy of remark that newspapers have almost entirely changed their form and character within the period under review.1 1 The eighteenth century. For a long time after they were first adopted as a medium of communication to the public, they were confined, in general, to the mere statement of facts. But they have gradually assumed an office more extensive, and risen to a more important station in society. They have become the vehicles of discussion, in which the principles of government, the interests of nations, the spirit and tendency of public measures, and the public and private characters of individuals, are all arraigned, tried, and decided. Instead, therefore, of being considered now, as they once were, of small moment in society, they have become immense moral and political engines, closely connected with the welfare of the state, and deeply involving both its peace and prosperity. "Newspapers have also become important in a literary view. There are few of them, within the last twenty years, which have not added to their political details some curious and useful information, on the various subjects of literature, science and art. They have thus become the means of conveying, to every class in society, innumerable scraps of knowledge, which have at once increased the public intelligence, and extended the taste for perusing periodical publications. The advertisements, moreover, which they daily contain, respecting new books, projects, inventions, discoveries and improvements, are well calculated to enlarge and enlighten the public mind, and are worthy of being enumerated among the many methods of awakening and maintaining the popular attention, with which more modern times, beyond all preceding example, abound. "In ancient times, to sow the seeds of civil discord, or to produce a spirit of union and co-operation through an extensive community, required time, patience, and a constant series of exertions. The art of printing being unknown, and many of the modern methods of communicating intelligence to distant places not having come into use, the difficulty of conducting public affairs must have been great and embarrassing. The general circulation of Gazettes forms an important era, not only in the moral and literary, but also in the political world. By means of this powerful instrument, impressions on the public mind may be made with a celerity, and to an extent, of which our remote ancestors had no conception, and which cannot but give rise to the most important consequences in society. Never was there given to man a political engine of greater power; and never, assuredly, did this engine before operate upon so large a scale as in the eighteenth century. "Our own country in particular, and especially for the last twelve or fifteen years, has exhibited a spectacle never before displayed among men, and even yet without a parallel on earth. It is the spectacle, not of the learned and the wealthy only, but of the great body of the people; even a large portion of that class of the community which is destined to daily labor, having free and constant access to public prints, receiving regular information of every occurrence, attending to the course of political affairs, discussing public measures, and having thus presented to them constant excitements to the acquisition of knowledge, and continual means of obtaining it. Never, it may be safely asserted, was the number of political journals so great in proportion to the population of a country as at present in ours. Never were they, all things considered, so cheap, so universally diffused, and so easy of access." And never were they actually perused by so large a majority of all classes since the art of printing was discovered.1 1 "The extreme cheapness with which newspapers are conveyed by the mail, in the United States, added to the circumstance of their being altogether unincumbered with a stamp duty, or any other public restriction, renders their circulation more convenient and general than in any other country." "The general effect of this unprecedented multiplication and diffusion of public prints, forms a subject of most interesting and complex calculation. On the one hand, when well conducted, they have a tendency to disseminate useful information; to keep the public mind awake and active; to confirm and extend the love of freedom; to correct the mistakes of the ignorant, and the impositions of the crafty; to tear off the mask from corrupt and designing politicians; and, finally, to promote union of spirit and of action among the most distant members of an extended community. But to pursue a path calculated to produce these effects, the conductors of public prints ought to be men of talents, learning, and virtue. Under the guidance of such characters, every Gazette would be a source of moral and political instruction, and, of course, a public blessing. "On the other hand, when an instrument so potent is committed to the weak, the ignorant, and the vicious, the most baneful consequences must be anticipated. When men of small talents, of little information, and of less virtue, undertake to be (as the editors of public gazettes, however contemptible their character may, in a degree, be considered) the directors of public opinion, what must be the result? We may expect to see the frivolities of weakness, the errors and malignity of prejudice, the misrepresentations of party zeal, the most corrupt doctrines in politics and morals, the lacerations of private character, and the poluting language of obscenity and impiety, daily issuing from the press, poisoning the principles, and disturbing the repose of society; giving to the natural and salutary collisions of parties the most brutal violence and ferocity; and, at length, consuming the best feelings and noblest charities of life, in the flame of civil discord. "In the former part of the eighteenth century, talents and learning, at least, if not virtue, were thought necessary in the conductors of political journals.1 1 "This has not been, generally, so much the case in America as in Europe. From the earliest period too many of our Gazettes have been in the hands of persons who were destitute both of talents and literature. But in later times, the number of editors who fall under this description has become even greater than formerly." OBSERVATION. There are few instances in which I would presume to differ with the ingenious author of these remarks, in opinion; but, on this oocasion, I must be allowed to observe, that I conceive there are among the men who conduct the public journals of America, many, whose literary acquirements are not inferior to those of their predecessors. The great difficulty proceeds from the rage of party spirit, which is kept alive by the frequency of elections, in which the conductors of newspapers engage as partizans; and some of them, it is true, as is also the case in Great Britain, display a greater degree of asperity and opprobriousness than can be justified, which must be a subject of regret to those who are truly interested in the welfare of the country. Few ventured to intrude into this arduous office, but those who had some claims to literature. Towards the close of the century, however, persons of less character, and of humbler qualifications, began, without scruple, to undertake the high task of enlightening the public mind. This remark applies, in some degree, to Europe; but it applies with particular force to our own country, where every judicious observer must perceive, that too many of our gazettes are in the hands of persons destitute at once of the urbanity of gentlemen, the information of scholars, and the principles of virtue. To this source, rather than to any peculiar depravity of national character, we may ascribe the faults of American newspapers, which have been pronounced by travellers the most profligate and scurrilous public prints in the civilized world.1 1 "These considerations, it is conceived, are abundantly sufficient to account for the disagreeable character of American newspapers. In every country the selfish principle prompts men to defame their personal and political enemies; and where the supposed provocations to this are numerous, and no restraints are imposed on the indulgence of the disposition, an inundation of filth and calumny must be expected. In the United States, the frequency of elections leads to a corresponding frequency of struggle between political parties; these struggles naturally engender mischievous passions, and every species of coarse invective; and, unhappily, too many of the conductors of our public prints have neither the discernment, the firmness, nor the virtue to reject from their pages the foul ebullitions of prejudice and malice. Had they more diligence, or greater talents, they might render their gazettes interesting, by filling them with materials of a more instructive and dignified kind; but wanting these qualifications, they must give such materials, accompanied with such a seasoning, as circumstances furnish. Of what kind these are no one is ignorant." "If the foregoing remarks be just, then the friend of rational freedom, and of social happiness, cannot but contemplate with the utmost solicitude, the future influence of political journals on the welfare of society. As they form one of the great safeguards of free government, so they also form one of its most threatening assailants. And unless public opinion (the best remedy that can be applied) should administer an adequate correction of the growing evil, we may anticipate the arrival of that crisis in which we must yield either to an abridgment of the liberty of the press, or to a disruption of every social bond."2 2 "The above remarks from Miller's Retrospect are not less applicable now than they were in 1810.—H.</field>

The dates of the years which precede the names of the booksellers, specify the earliest periods when they are known to have been in business. The precise time could not, in all cases, be ascertained. BOSTON. 1652. Hezekiah Usher, was the first bookseller in English America of whom I can find any account. Books formed a proportion of his stock in trade; and the first works which were published in this country were printed for him. Of these an edition of the New England version of the Psalms, small 12mo, to bind up with Bibles, claims the precedence. The imprint to that book is, "Cambridge, Printed for Hezekiah Usher, of Boston." The date and the name of the printer are omitted; but I have no doubt the book had gone through three or four editions, as early as the year 1652. Soon after the settlement of some parts of America, a corporation was established in England for propagating the gospel among the Indians in New England; and Usher1 1 In 1692, a respectable man whose name was Hezekiah Usher, was accused of witchcraft, in consequence of which accusation he was ordered to be confined in the common prison; but on account of the goodness of his character, he was, by connivance, allowed to secrete himself in the house of a friend; and, afterwards to escape out of the hands of his persecutors, until the delusion or madness of the times, in part, subsided, and reason restored the balm of tranquility to the public mind. The person so accused was, probably, the bookseller, or one of his sons. See Brattle's Letter, Mass. Hist. Coll., 1st vol.—II. was agent for managing the pecuniary concerns between the corporation and the commissioners of the United colonies in New England. He procured the types, paper, &amp;c., and managed the transactions relating to printing the Bible in the Indian language, which was in the press from 1660 to 1663. Besides bookselling, he conducted a commercial establishment, and acquired considerable property. 1672. John Usher, the son of Hezekiah. In 1672 an edition of the laws, revised and alphabetically arranged, was printed by S. Green, in Cambridge, for John Usher in Boston. I have seen several books printed for him since that time. An English bookseller, who was an author, and resided some time in Boston,1 1 John Dunton. wrote thus concerning John Usher. "This Trader makes the best figure in Boston; he's very Rich, adventures much to Sea; but has got his estate by Book-Selling; he proposed to me the buying of my whole Venture,2 2 A large collection of books bought by Dunton to sell in Boston, anno 1686. but would not agree to my Terms; and so we parted with a great deal of seeming respect." John Usher was treasurer of the province when Sir Edmund Andros was governor. He was employed by the government of Massachusetts, when he was in England, to purchase the province of Maine from the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. In 1683, he became lieutenant governor of New Hampshire, which office he retained some years; but, during the time he resided chiefly in Boston, and carried on his business as usual. "He was a man of unpolished manners, severe in the execution of his office, was but little of a statesman, and less of a courtier,3 3 Belknap's History of New Hampshire, 1, p. 289. and became so odious to the people, that they prevailed on the king and council to remove him." He had a seat at Charlestown at which he resided after he retired from business, anno 1700. 1673. Edmund Ranger, was a binder; but had some small concern in bookselling. 1679. William Avery, "Near the Blue-Anchor." I have found but few books printed for him. 1680. Samuel Phillips, "At the Brick-Shop at the West-End of the Town-House." Considering the infant state of the settlement, he was a large dealer in books; many of which were consigned to him by Dunton, who was his factor in London. He published several books which were printed in Boston. Dunton mentions Phillips as his "old correspondent;" and observes further, "On visiting him in Boston, he treated me with a noble Dinner, and (if I may trust my Eyes) is blest with a pretty, obliging Wife; I'll say that for Sam (after dealing with him for some Hundred Pounds) he's very just, and (as an Effect of that) very Thriving. I shall only add to his Character, that he's Young and Witty, and the most Beautiful Man in the Town of Boston." He died in October 1720, aged 58; and was characterized in the Boston Gazette, as "an exemplary Christian, an indulgent husband, a kind father and a true friend." The descendants of Samuel Phillips continued the bookselling business in Cornhill, till after the revolution. They traded in English goods also, as was customary with the booksellers in Boston for a century after the town was first settled. 1682. John Ratcliffe did but little work as a bookseller; but I have discovered a few pamphlets which were printed for him. 1682. Samuel Sewall, was a bookseller, although not bred to the trade. He was appointed by the government to the office of a magistrate; and, in 1681, was made conductor of the press in Boston, with permission to carry on printing in that town.1 1 This was the celebrated Chief Justice. See vol. 1, pp. 86–7.—II. 1682. John Griffin. I have seen only two books printed for him, and one for him and John Ratcliffe. 1684. Richard Wilkins, "Near the Town-House." He had been a bookseller at Limerick, in Ireland, but came to New England as an asylum from religious persecution, and settled in Boston. Dunton gives the following description of him: "His Person is Tall, his Aspect Sweet and Smiling, and tho' but Fifty Years old [in 16862 2 This statement of Dunton is not altogether correct; Wilkins was then 63 years old. ] his Hair is as White as Snow. He is a Person of good Sense, keeps up the Practice of Religion in his Family, and (upon a Nice Search into all his Affairs) I found it had a General Influence on all the Actions of his Life: He was deservedly chosen a Member of Mr. Willard's Church, and I think he's a Pious Man, if there's such a Thing in Boston." He died at Milton, December 10, 1704, aged 81, and was buried in Boston. Dunton gives the characters of Wilkins's wife and daughter, who were very amiable and accomplished women. During the eight months that Dunton carried on bookselling in Boston, he boarded with Wilkins, who did considerable business. When Dunton left that place, he empowered Wilkins to collect such debts as were due to him there. 1684. Joseph Brunning, alias Browning, "At the Corner of Prison-Lane," now Court street, in Cornhill, was from Amsterdam; he wrote his name Brunning, or Browning, at pleasure. He traded largely and published many books, the imprints in which are indifferently spelled Brunning or Browning; one of these being the Dutch, the other the English way of writing his name. Dunton mentions him in a very handsome manner. In describing his visits to the various booksellers in Boston, after his arrival there in 1686, he thus characterizes Brunning: "I rambled next to visit Minheer Brunning, he's a Dutch bookseller from Holland, scrupulously just, plain in his cloaths, and if we will believe the Printers in Boston (who are notable Criticks in such cases) a most excellent Paymaster. Brunning is vers'd in the Knowledge of all sorts of Books, and may well be stil'd a Complet Bookseller. He never decries a Book because 'tis not of his own printing; there are some Men that will run down the most Elaborate Pieces, only because they had none of their Midwifery to bring 'em into public view, and yet shall give the greatest Encomiums to the most Nauseous Trash, when they had the hap to be concerned in it. But Brunning was none of these; for he'd promote a good Book whoever printed it; and I found him a Man of that great Interest, that I made him my Partner in printing Mr. Mather's Sermon, preached at the Execution of Morgan, who was the only person executed in that Country for near Seven years."1 1 Dunton's Life and Errors. 1684. Duncan Campbell, "At the Dock-Head over against the Conduit," was from Glasgow, and was, probably, the father of John Campbell who, in 1704, was post master in Boston, and the proprietor of the first newspaper which was published in the English American colonies.2 2 I bid Dunton mentions Campbell by name, as "the Scotch Bookseller," and says, "he is very industrious, dresses a la mode, and I'm told, a Young Lady of Great Fortune, is fal'n in love with him." 1685. Andrew Thorncomb, from London; he was a bookseller in that city. I believe he, like many others for some years after the settlement of Boston, came over with a quantity of books on speculation, and having sold them, perhaps the greater part by wholesale, returned to Europe. Dunton writes that he was acquainted with Thorncomb in New England, and mentions that "his Company was Coveted by the best Gentlemen in Boston, nor is he less acceptable to the Fair Sex; for he has something in him so extremely charming as makes 'em very fond of his Company. However he's a vertuous Person, and deserves all the respect they shew'd him." 1686. James Cowse. I have seen only one book printed for him namely "The Church of Rome, evidently proved Heretick." 1686. John Dunton, was born at Graffham, Huntingdonshire, in England; his father was fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and rector of Graffham. Dunton was brought up to the bookselling business in London; where he entered extensively into the trade; and in the course of time became a very considerable publishing bookseller. He had a general correspondence with the booksellers of England, Scotland, Ireland and Boston. But fortune did not always smile on Dunton. He lost a large sum through becoming surety for his brother-in-law, and was a great sufferer by the troubles of England in 1685; insomuch that his circumstances became embarrassed. On the death of Charles II, James II, his brother, ascended the throne of England; who being a great enemy to the duke of Monmouth, the natural son of Charles II, caused him to be expelled from Holland, by the prince of Orange; and was the occasion of his being persecuted in Brussels. Being a favorite-with the people, Monmouth was stimulated by that consideration, and by a principle of revenge, to make an attempt to dethrone James, and place the crown of England on his own head. He landed in England, raised a small army, which was defeated, and he was beheaded in consequence of this rebellion. His adherents fled; and Dunton, being one of these fugitives, escaped to Boston, where the sum of five hundred pounds sterling—a considerable object in the deranged state of his circumstances—was due to him; and his design in going there was to collect his debts. The management of his affairs in London he intrusted to his wife, who, according to his own account, was a most excellent woman, and he had a great affection for her. He embarked on board a ship then lying at Gravesend, and took with him books suitable for the Boston market to a large amount. He put others to the value of five hundred pounds sterling on board another vessel, destined to the same port. The ships were overtaken by foul weather, before they cleared the British channel. That which bore the consignment was lost, but the other, in which Dunton had embarked, weathered the storm. After a tedious passage of more than four months duration he arrived in Boston. Dunton had taken the precaution of procuring letters of recommendation to the most eminent clergymen in Massachusetts, and to the principal gentlemen in Boston; in consequence of which he was kindly received and politely treated on his arrival. He procured a warehouse where he exposed his books for sale, and found a good market for them. At the expiration of seven or eight months he had a considerable number of books unsold; but he opened a store in Salem, where he soon disposed of the same. During Dunton's residence in Boston, he visited the governor, lieutenant governor, the principal magistrates, &amp;c., and dined with them in the town hall, on the day of election. He paid his respects to all the clergy, in and about Boston, Dr. Increase Mather, the Rev. Cotton Mather, Messrs. Willard, Alien, Eliot, Higginson, of Salem, and many other ministers. Dr. Mather he calls the "metropolitan clergyman of the country." When he had sold off his books, he took leave of his friends, and returned to England. On his arrival there he was apprehensive of a prosecution, for which reason, after remaining some time incognito, he went to Holland, Germany and Ireland. A revolution having been effected in England, in 1688, Dunton returned to London, and recommenced business on the very day the Prince of Orange arrived in that city. Dunton again launched forth into extensive business; and published many works, among which were some that were periodical. The Athenian Gazette, which was afterwards denominated The Athenian Mercury, was continued several years, and the editors of it, among whom Dunton was the principal, were highly complimented in poetical and prosaic essays, by Gildon, Motteux, De Foe, Richardson, and the celebrated poet laureat, N. Tate, who was concerned in a version of the Psalms, which is well known in America. His other periodical works were The Post-Angell, and The Night Walker. As a kind of drawback on Dunton's fame, I ought, perhaps, candidly to mention that he had the misfortune to be introduced into Pope's Dunciad,1 1 Book II, v. 144, &amp;c. where the present of the goddess Dulness to Curl is represented as "A shaggy tapestry, worthy to be spread On Codrus' old, or Dunton'S modern bed." The note of the Scriblerus Club, on this passage, runs thus, "John Dunton was a broken bookseller, and abusive scribler; he writ Neck or Nothing, a violent satire on some ministers of state; a libel on the duke of Devonshire, and the bishop of Peterborough, &amp;c." In justice to Dunton I must observe, that this severity was, perhaps, wholly unmerited, and produced solely by a difference of opinion; as the works which the club calls libels might be strictly conformable to truth, and probably met the applause of those who thought like Dunton. During his second run of business Dunton lost his wife; and married another, whose fortune, though considerable, was not payable till a younger brother came of age. After ten years of success in business, the tide again turned, and through losses in trade, and other misfortunes, Dunton again became embarrassed. On this occasion he pressed his wife's mother to enable him to pay his debts, but could not prevail, although he thought to enforce compliance, by abstaining from the usual intercourse with his wife. To these means he added entreaty and argument; but they proved equally ineffectual; and Dunton, who formerly wrote for profit and fame, was now obliged to write for his daily subsistence. At this period, anno 1705, he published The Life and Errors of John Dunton, late Citizen of London; Written by Himself in Solitude. He gives an account of his voyage to Boston, of his business there, and of his travels in Holland and Germany. He characterizes upwards of a thousand persons then living, among whom were the booksellers of most note in Boston, many of the clergy and other eminent persons he visited, or with whom he was acquainted, together with several of his male and female customers, in and about "the metropolis of New England;" after which he proceeds to the authors for whom he published, all the printers, binders, engravers on wood and copper, whom he had employed, and the company of stationers in London; and, he concludes with the most conspicuous of his London customers. He was an adept in writing of this kind, and appeared to engage in it with peculiar pleasure and ease. In this work there is a singular mixture of humor, anecdote and religion, and it is, perhaps, a true picture of the mind and disposition of the author. At the conclusion of it he observes, "could I not compose a few sheets for the press, I might now starve; but it is well known that in the course of a few years I shall be able to pay all I owe to a half farthing." Dunton had a patent from king William and queen Mary, for the sole printing and publishing an English translation of The History of the Edict of Nantz, in four volumes. During the life of his first wife he made a will, and appointed her sole executrix, and desired her to bury him the seventh day after his death, and not before, lest he should come to life, as his mother had done on the day appointed for her funeral. This circumstance, respecting his mother, he relates at the beginning of his Life, &amp;c. Having been sick, she, to all appearance, died. "After lying three days, her friends were about to put her into a Coffin for interment, when to their astonishment she revived from the trance in which she had fallen, and was thus mercifully restored; in a year after she dy'd in earnest." Dunton was a man of a singular character. He appears to have been a complete, enterprising bookseller; and was sensible, humorous and religious. 1690. Nicholas Buttolph, "Next to Guttridge's Coffee-House." I have discovered many books which were printed for him. He carried on business about fifty years, and was a man of respectability. On the 29th of January, 1737, he died, considerably advanced in years. 1690. Benjamin Elliott, "Under the Exchange, Head of King-Street." He was largely concerned in publishing books, among which were the laws of the general court; and he was a noted dealer in books which were printed in Boston. He was about fifty years in business; and died November 9, 1741, aged seventy-six years. 1690. Benjamin Harris, had a bookstore "at the London Coftee-House," two or three years; but removed to "The Sign of the Bible over against the Blew-Anchor, Cornhill." He had been a bookseller and printer in London, and he printed and published several books during his residence in Boston;1 1 See Printers in Boston. where he remained five or six years. He returned to England, and followed printing and bookselling in London. 1690, Obadiah Gill, was but little known as a dealer in books. I have seen only two pamphlets which were printed for him. 1690. James Wade. I have found a few pamphlets with the imprint, "Boston, Printed for James Wade," which is all the intelligence I can procure concerning him. 1695. Michael Perry, "under the West-End of the Town House,"2 2 The present old state house was built on the site of the town house. was a publisher as well as a vender of books, and did considerable business. 1695. Vavasour Harris, "opposite the Old meeting house, in Cornhill," was a short time in the business. 1699. Elkanah Pembroke, "near the Head of the Dock." 1700. Samuel Sewall, junior, was the son of Samuel Sewall, who was appointed conductor of the press, and was authorized to print in Boston. I do not find that he was largely in trade. 1701. Nicholas Boone, "at the Bible in Cornhill." In 1704, when The Boston News-Letter made its first appearance, it was printed by B. Green, and published by Boone, for John Campbell, the proprietor of it, who was postmaster. Boone was an eminent bookseller, and many books, written in America, were published by him. 1711. Eleazar Phillips, "at the Sign of the Eagle in Newbury Street," afterwards "at the Lower-End of King Street;" and, in 1715, he removed to Charlestown, near Boston. He was the only bookseller who had settled in that town prior to the revolution; but never embarked largely in trade. One of his sons established the first press in South Carolina; and died there in 1732, soon after he began printing. Some time after the death of his son, Phillips went to Carolina: and after remaining there a few months he returned to his business in Massachusetts. In 1750, Phillips published in the Boston Evening-Post, a short address to the public, in which he recommended the raising of silk worms in New England. He stated that when he resided in Carolina, he was informed by a silk weaver that "only one crop" could be raised there in a year; that he had made an experiment with eggs which he brought from Philadelphia, and found that he could raise two crops, annually, in New England. The advantage he attributed to the climate, which he supposed was more favorable to the growth of the mulberry, than that of South Carolina, which he thought too warm to produce food so nutricious and congenial to worms as that raised in more temperate regions. Where vegetation is less rapid, and the leaves longer in coming to maturity, they do not ripen and decay so speedily as in Carolina. His advice does not appear to have been regarded. Phillips lived to the age of upwards of seventy-five years. 1712. Joanna Perry, "King-Street, near the townhouse." She was the widow of Michael Perry, and after his death continued the business several years. Some pamphlets were printed for her. She died September 19, 1725. 1712. Samuel Gerrish, "at the Sign of the Buck in Marlborough-Street," but in 1716, "North Side of the Town-House." He published a number of small books, and seems to have carried on considerable trade. 1713. Daniel Henchman, "Cornhill, Corner of King-Street, opposite to the Old Brick-Meeting-House." Henchman was the most eminent and enterprising bookseller that appeared in Boston, or, indeed, in all British America, before the year 1775. He furnished much employment for the presses in Boston; and several books were printed for him in London, which were sent over in sheets. He was principally concerned in an edition of the Bible, and another of the New Testament, which were printed privately in Boston.1 1 Vide vol. 1, p. 107. Henchman built the first paper mill in New England; in doing which he received aid from the legislature of Massachusetts. During his long connexion with the trade he acquired a handsome estate. He was made a justice of the peace; a lieutenant colonel of the Boston regiment of militia; and, finally, was made a deacon of the Old South church. He died February 25, 1761, aged seventy-two years. 1715. George Brownell, lived at "the North End," and advertised that he taught "Writing, Cyphering, Navigation, also Musick and Dancing." And he sold books also. I have seen an Almanack which was printed for him; but he was very little knowu as a bookseller. He removed to Philadelphia. 1717. Gillam Phillips, "over against the West-End of the Town-House." He was neither largely nor long in the trade. I have seen only two small works printed for him. A considerable fortune was left to him, and he retired from business. He died October 18, 1770, aged seventy-five years. 1719. Benjamin Gray, at the "Head of Town-Dock," published several books, among which was a pamphlet, the publication whereof brought on him a prosecution on the part of the government, as appears by the following record of the proceedings of the council, viz.: "At a Council Held at the Council-Chamber, in Boston, on Thursday the 28th day of February, 1720 [i. e. 1721, new style.] "A pamphlet, entituled, a letter to an Eminent ClergyMan in the Massachusetts-Bay; being produced at the Board, was Read and considered, and Unanimously Voted, That it contains in it many Vile, Scandalous, and very Abusive Expressions, which greatly reflect on His Majesty's Government and People of this Province, and tend to disturb the Publick Peace. "At the same time Benj. Gray of Boston, Bookseller, who Sold the said Pamphlet, being Sent for, Acknowledged that he had caused the same to be Printed, And that the Original in manuscript was delivered to him by an unknown Hand, upon Saturday the Eighth Currant, at Nine a Clock at Night. "Advised, That the Attorney-General be directed to Prosecute in the Law, the said Benj. Gray, or any other Person that may have been concerned in the making or Publishing the said Pamphlet. "Resolved, That the foregoing Votes be printed in the Weekly Papers. "J. Willard, Secr." I am not perfectly acquainted with the result of this affair, but I believe it was terminated by a compromise. Gray, though not a very considerable bookseller, was many years in trade, and worked at bookbinding. He died January 7, 1751. 1719. John Edwards, "King-Street." I can learn but little respecting him, further than that he published a few books. 1720. Robert Starkey, "Fleet-Street," was from London. Whilst in business in that city, he published a book containing reflections on the British government; and fled to Holland to avoid a prosecution. After the prince of Orange ascended the English throne he returned to England, and continued his business in London several years; he also made a voyage to Boston; but did not go largely into trade there. How long he remained in New England I cannot ascertain. It is said he was a man who possessed much information, and was a zealous asserter of English liberty. 1723. Joseph Edwards, "Cornhill," was a very respectable, and a considerable publisher, bookseller and binder. He continued in business more than forty years. 1723. Nathaniel Belknap, "Head of Scarlet's Wharf, North End." He bound books, but did not go largely into the sale of them. Some small pamphlets were published by him. In April, 1730, he published in the Boston papers the following advertisement: "To be Sold, Choice black Mold for Gardens, &amp;c. at a very reasonable rate, By Mr. Nath. Belknap, Bookseller, at the North-End of Boston." 1723. Samuel Robinson, was born in Dorchester, and served his apprenticeship with Boone. He sold some books, but his principal business was that of a binder. He died at the age of eighty-five years, in February, 1771. 1724. John Checkley, was I believe, an Englishman, and of the high church party. He published and sold a pamphlet, containing 132 pages, octavo, entitled "A Short and Easie Method with the Deists. Wherein the certainty of the Christian Religion is demonstrated, by infallible Proof from Four Rules, which are incompatible to any Imposture that ever yet has been, or that can possibly be." The imprint to the book was, "Printed in London, by J. Applebee, and sold by John Checkley at the Sign of the Crown and Blue-Gate, over-against the West-End of the Town-House, in Boston, 1723." Checkley was prosecuted at the inferior court in Boston, anno 1724, for publishing and selling this pamphlet, which was called "a false and scandalous libel, tending to draw into dispute his present majesty's title to the crown—scandalizing the ministers of the gospel, established by law in this province—falsifying the Holy Scriptures—representing the church of Rome as the present mother church; and tending to raise divisions, jealousies, and animosities, among his majesty's loving subjects of this province." Checkley was convicted, and appealed to the superior court, in which the jury gave the following verdict: "The Jury find Specially, viz. If the Book entituled a Short and Easy Method with the Deists, containing in it a Discourse concerning Episcopacy, (published, and many of them sold by the said Checkley) be a false and scandalous libel; Then we find the said Checkley guilty of all and every Part of the Indictment (excepting that supposed to traduce and draw into dispute the undoubted Right and Title of our Sovereign Lord, King George, to the Kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland, and the territories thereto belonging.) But if the said Book, containing a discourse concerning Episcopacy, as aforesaid, be not a false and scandalous Libel; Then we find him not guilty. "Attt. Samuel Tyley, Clerk." An able plea in arrest of judgment, was made by his counsel; after which Checkley addressed the court, and in the same handsome manner and style in which he had before addressed the court and jury, he maintained that the church of England, as established in England, and no other, was established in all his majesty's plantations— that no minister was lawfully appointed, but he who was ordained by a bishop—and he gave it as his opinion, that presbyterian and congregational ministers, so called, were no ministers, and that they and their congregations were schismatics, and excommunicated by the laws of the land; or rather by the canons of the church of England, which he said were a part of the laws of the land. The sentence of the court was as follows: "The Court having maturely advised on this Special Verdict, are of Opinion that the said John Checkley is guilty of publishing and selling of a false and scandalous Libel. It's therefore considered by the Court, that the said John Checkley shall pay a Fine of Fifty Pounds to the King, and enter into Recognizance in the sum of One Hundred Pounds, with two Sureties in the Sum of Fifty Pounds each, for his good Behaviour for six Months, and also pay costs of prosecution, standing committed until this Sentence be performed. "Attt. Samuel Tyley, Clerk." Checkley paid the fine and costs of court the next day, according to the sentence, and was discharged. Sometime after he went to England, and there received episcopal ordination. He returned to New England; was many years rector of St. John's church in Providence; and was highly esteemed for his learning and many amiable qualifications. Whether he was a regular bookseller or not, I am not prepared to say; I have seen no book printed for him in America. 1725. John Phillips, "Stationers'-Arms, Corn-Hill," was the son of Samuel Phillips, and succeeded him in business. Besides a considerable trade as a publishing bookseller and binder, he was a dealer in English goods, according to the custom of those times. During several years, Phillips was engaged in the service of the public, as a magistrate, a colonel of the Boston militia, a member of the general court and a deacon of the church in Brattle street. He died April 19, 1763, and was buried with military honors. 1726. Bennet Love, "in Anne-Street, near the Bridge." His principal business appears to have been binding; but some pamphlets were printed for him. 1727. Samuel Kneeland, "in King-Street, next door to the Post-Office." He kept a bookstore four or five years at that place; but during the remainder of his life he attended wholly to printing. 1726. Thomas Hancock, "Anne-Street, near the drawbridge;" was the son of the Rev. John Hancock of Lexington. After being in trade a few years as a bookseller and binder, he turned his attention to merchandize, in which pursuit he acquired a very handsome fortune, and became one of the principal commercial persons in New England. In process of time he became a member of the lower house of assembly, and was afterwards a member of the council. His disposition was naturally benevolent, and his religious and political senitments were liberal. I believe he served his apprenticeship with Daniel Henchman, whose daughter he married. By his last will he bequeathed 1000l. sterling to Harvard College, for the purpose of founding a professorship of the Hebrew and other oriental languages; also 750l, sterling to an incorporated society for propagating the gospel among the Indians, in North America; and 450l, sterling to the town of Boston, towards building an hospital for the reception of lunatics. As he had no children, he bequeathed the greater part of his estate to his nephew, the late governor John Hancock. He built the large stone house near the State House, where he lived; and after his death it became the residence of his nephew the governor. On the 1st of August, 1764, as he was entering the council chamber, he was attacked by a fit of apoplexy, and died in two hours, aged 62. 1727. Nathaniel Proctor, "At the Bible and Dove in Anne-Street," born in Boston; was a bookseller and binder, and published a few pamphlets. He married a woman who was supposed to have been a widow; but a short time after his marriage, the former husband of his wife returned after an absence of ten or twelve years, and claimed her. This event occasioned much embarrassment; but the parties having left the solution of the difficulty to the wife, she decided in favor of Proctor. He died suddenly, December 8, 1766. 1728. John Eliot, "At the Great Elms,1 1 One of these elms stood in the yard, fronting Eliot's house, and was afterwards called The Tree of Liberty, occasioned by the effigy of the person appointed distributor of the stamps in Boston, and that of lord Bute, being hung thereon in 1765. This strong method adopted by the people, of expressing their dislike of the obnoxious stamp act, must have had an influence in producing that state of the public mind which brought about the revolution. South-End," was said to be a descendant of the Rev. John Eliot, of Roxbury, who translated the Bible into the Indian language. He published a few books, and was, many years, a bookseller and binder, but his concerns were not extensive. However, he acquired some property; and being a respectable man, was made deacon of the church in Hollis street. He died, November, 1771, aged 81. 1729. Alford Butler, "Lower-End of King-Street, near the Crown Coffee-House, at the head of the Long-Wharf." He was born in Boston, and served his apprenticeship with Henchman. His principal business was binding, but he published and sold a few books. He died in 1742, aged 46. 1730. Hopestill Foster, did some business as a bookseller, but it was very inconsiderable. 1730.

Ebenezer Pemberton, of the new brick church, formerly so called, in Middle street. He was an apprentice to Robinson; but was chiefly employed in binding. He died about 1759. 1732. Richard Fry, an Englishman, resided a few years in Boston; and was probably concerned in the paper mill then lately erected at Milton, which was the only one in Massachusetts. I cannot ascertain whether Fry ever had a shop of his own in Boston, or made use of that belonging to Fleet altogether. The principal discoveries I have made concerning him are comprised in the following advertisement, which was published in The Rehearsal, May 1732. "Richard Fry, Stationer, Bookseller, Paper Maker and Rag Merchant from the city of London, keeps at Mr. Tho. Fleet's Printer, at the Heart and Crown in Cornhill, Boston; where said Fry is ready to accommodate all Gentlemen, Merchants and Tradesmen, with Setts of Accompt Books after the neatest Manner. And whereas it has been the common Method of the most curious Merchants in Boston, to procure their Books from London. This is to acquaint those Gentlemen, that I the said Fry will sell all Sorts of Accompt Books done after the most acute Manner, for Twenty per Cent cheaper than they can have them from London. I return the Public Thanks for following the Directions of my former Advertisement for gathering Rags, and hope they will Continue the like Method, having received upwards of Seven Thousand Weight already. "For the pleasing Entertainment of the Polite part of Mankind, I have Printed the most beautiful Poems of Mr. Stephen Duck, the famous Wiltshire Poet. It is a full Demonstration to me, that the People of New England have a fine Taste for good Sense and polite Learning, having already Sold 1200 of those Poems. Rich. Fry." 1733. T. Cox, "At the Lamb, on the South-Side of the Town-House," was a bookseller from England, who kept a good supply of English editions, principally of such books as were valuable, and suitable for the market. He generally resided in London, and his business was transacted by an agent. He discontinued his bookstore in Boston, anno 1744; and the remains of his stock in trade were sold by auction. 1733. John Boydell, "In King-Street." He came from England in 1716, with Governor Shute, to whom he was Secretary; and being afterwards appointed postmaster, he was for many years proprietor and publisher of The Boston Gazette. Boydell was greatly esteemed. He died in December, 1739. [See Hist. of Newspapers.] 1735. John Parker, "Head of the Town-Dock," sold cutlery, groceries, and some books. He died in 1738. 1736.

Samuel Eliot, "Corn-Hill," published a number of pamphlets, which were written in New England; he was a considerable bookseller, and was also a binder and stationer. He died May 9, 1745, aged 32. His widow carried on the business; and his son Samuel Eliot, became an eminent merchant. 1743. John Eliot, "At the Great Elms," was the son of John Eliot who for many years did business at the same place. Some books printed for John Eliot the younger have this imprint: "for J. Eliot, near the South-Market.1 1 At that time there were three market houses in Boston; one near the Great elms; one in Dock square, and another in Old North square. He lived to an advanced age. 1743. Walter MacAlpine, "Near the Mill-Bridge," afterwards "in Union-Street near the Town-Dock." He was from Scotland, and was a bookseller and binder. He removed to Connecticut and died there. 1743. Nathaniel Gookin, "Cornhill." 1743. Joshua Blanchard, "Sign of the Bible and Crown in Dock-Square," was an enterprising but not a successful bookseller. Blanchard was one of the original proprietors and publishers of The American Magazine, which was first published in 1743; and was concerned in other publications. He was a dealer in English editions, in stationery, &amp;c., but finally he confined his trade solely to English goods. 1743. Alexander Carlisle, A Scotchman; served his apprenticeship in Glasgow; he came from that place with a collection of books; sold them chiefly at auction, and returned to Scotland. 1745. Daniel Gookin, "Over against the Old-South." He was a descendant of Gen. Daniel Gookin, one of the first appointed licensers of the press, anno, 1662. Gookin was not largely in trade; he died January 3, 1752, after an illness of only two days. I am of opinion he had a son who was named after him, and succeeded him in the same shop, which was the next door north of the house built for the residence of the royal governors, and now belonging to the state. 1745. Thomas Rand, "Cornhill, near the sign of the Three Nuns," afterwards "in Anne-Street." He was by trade a binder, but sold stationery and some books. 1745.

Thomas Leverett, "Cornhill," was a very respectable bookseller, binder, stationer, and dealer in English goods. He died June 28, 1778, aged 46. 1753. William MacAlpine, "Marlborough-Street," brother to Walter MacAlpine, was bred to binding, &amp;c., by his brother; and became a considerable bookseller. In 1762, he set up a press, and entered into the printing business. As MacAlpine was a royalist, he left Boston with the British troops in 1776; soon after which he returned to Scotland, and died at Glasgow, anno 1788. 1754. Caleb Blanchard, "Dock-Square," was a brother to Joshua. He was originally a dealer in books, but became an importer of English goods. 1755. Timothy White, "Marshall's-Lane," and other situations in Boston; sold small books; but was chiefly employed about plain binding. He did very little business of any kind. During the siege, he remained in the town; and afterwards removed into the country, where he died. 1757. Samuel Webb, "Anne-Street," was born in Boston, where he served his apprenticeship with Henchman. He carried on bookselling and binding a number of years, but not to a very considerable extent.

Jeremy Condy, "Near Concert-Hall," afterwards "in Union-Street, opposite the Sign of the Cornfield," kept a supply of valuable books, chiefly English editions, and stationery.

William Lang, "at the Gilt Bible, Marlboro'Street." He came from Scotland, and was brought up to binding, which business he followed in Boston, and accompanied it with bookselling. His sales were chiefly confined to Scotch editions of school and religious books. He died in Boston before the year 1775. 1761. John Wharton, "Cornhill, Corner of King-Street," opposite the Old Brick Church. He and Nicholas Bowes began business in company under the firm of Wharton &amp; Bowes. They succeeded Daniel Henchman, whose stand, which had been occupied many years as a book and stationery store, with his stock, they took possession of. Their business was not so extensive as that of their predecessor, particularly in the publishing line; very few books were printed for them, as they confined themselves, principally, to trading in English editions. Wharton died in January 1768, aged 34. Bowes continued the business till he died, in April 1790. 1762. John Hodgson, "Marlborough-Street," was bred to bookbinding in Scotland, and became a good workman. He was chiefly employed in this business, but sold a few books. By permission of the court, he took, in short hand, the trial of the soldiers who were concerned in the massacre at Boston, on the evening of the 5th of March, 1770. He gave up his shop in 1768, and was employed by John Mein. Afterwards he sold small books from a stall in the market place. He died about the year 1781. 1762. Philip Freeman, "Union Street." He was an Englishman, who had been brought up a glover and breeches maker, which trade or trades, he followed in Boston, and was a dealer in what is called soft leather. In the course of time he began to keep a small collection of books for sale, and had several pamphlets printed; these were on religious subjects. He was punctual in his dealings, well respected, and was made a deacon of the First Baptist Church. He died in April 1779, aged 77. 1762. James Rivington, "at the London Book-Store, head of King-Street." He was an Englishman, and a considerable bookseller in London.

Miller acted as agent to Rivington one year; when he became his partner; and the firm was, "Rivington &amp; Miller, at the London bookstore, head of King-Street, North Side of the Court House." At this period Rivington lived in New York. Miller was a young man of amiable manners, and was well acquainted with the trade. He died in November 1765, and the business was discontinued. 1763. William Phillips, "Cornhill," was the son of John Phillips, and succeeded him in business. Being bred a merchant, he turned his attention to the sale of English goods. He died January 6, 1772. 1764. Alford Butler, "Cornhill," was the son of Alford Butler who has already been mentioned. He was born in Boston, where he served his apprenticeship with William MacAlpine, and became a binder and sold a few books. In 1774 he removed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and there kept a school near twenty years, after which he returned, and again carried on business as formerly. 1764. Andrew Barclay, "at the Bible in Cornhill." from Scotland, was bred to binding, and followed that business several years after he arrived in Boston. He sold a few books. 1764. John Mein, was from Scotland, and began business as a bookseller, in partnership with his countryman Sandeman, "in Marlborough Street." Their sales were wholly confined to Scotch and English editions; and their partnership closed at the expiration of one year. In 1766, Mein kept the "London Book-Store North Side of King-Street." where he opened a large and valuable collection of European books, and a handsome assortment of stationery. As he sold for a reasonable profit, his trade became extensive. He commenced printing in partnership with John Fleming; reprinted several books, and published The Boston Chronicle, of which he was the editor. Mein was a staunch royalist; the publications in the Chronicle rendered him very obnoxious; in consequence of which he returned to Europe in November 1769; his bookstore was then closed; and the Chronicle discontinued in 1770. 1764. Sandeman, "Marlborough-Street," came from Scotland in 1764, in company with his uncle, the celebrated preacher and founder of the sect called Sandemanians. Mein, the partner of Sandeman, came in the same ship. 1766. Cox and Berry, first opened a shop "opposite Brattle-Street Church." whence they removed to "two doors above the British Coffee-House," and, afterwards to "Cornhill."

He was also made secretary at war before and after the adoption of the present constitution. He died at Thomastown, in the district of Maine, October 25, 1806. 1771. A. Ellison, "Newbury-Street," was born in England, and brought up to binding; which business he followed in Boston, and sold a few books in common use.

The chief of the printing done in Cambridge and Boston, previously to the year 1750, was for booksellers; printers did but little on their own account. Even the laws, acts, &amp;c., of the government were printed for booksellers. The books printed during a century, in New England, were nearly all on religion, politics, or for the use of schools. Booksellers' Meeting, 1724. The booksellers of Boston, in 1724, had a meeting for the purpose of augmenting the prices of sundry books; an addition to the prices was agreed on; but, I believe not generally adopted.

He came to New York about 1745, and worked as a journeyman about six years in Parker's printing house; first, at 9s. currency (one dollar and an eighth) per week, and found himself; and afterwards he had a small allowance for board. His economy was such that from these wages he contrived to lay up money; having accumulated the sum of seventy-five pounds, he found a friend who imported for him a press and a few types, the cost of which exceeded the sum he had saved about one hundred dollars. With these materials he opened a printing house, and by persevering industry and economy was soon enabled to discharge the debt he had contracted for his press and types, and to open a book store. Eventually he acquired a large fortune. 1761. Garrat Noel, "near the Meal Market," afterwards "next door to the Merchant's Coffee-House."

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. APPENDIX A. [Page 4.] The date of the newspaper mentioned in the note on page 4 (viz. Nov. 3d to Dec. 3d, 1640), is the earliest date of the Thomason Collection in the British Museum, of publications made during the period of the English commonwealth. These range from Nov. 3, 1640, to May, 1661. Besides the Perfect Occurrences of Every daies iournal in Parliament, we have a memorandum of another paper with the title of Diurnal Occurrences in Parliament, the dates of which are given thus, "from 3d Nov. 1640 to 3d Nov. 1641." "The same from 22d Nov. 1641 to 28th March, 1642." "The same, to 17th Oct. 1642." "The same, ending March 10th, 1648." In 1642 there was A Diurnal of Dangers. The first daily newspaper published was supposed to be the Daily Courant, issued in London, England, on the 11th of March, 1702, soon after the accession of Queen Anne. A. recent contributor to the London Times asserts that there had been an English daily journal forty-two years before that time. That in 1660, on the 8th, 9th and 10th of March, appeared three numbers of A Perfect Diurnal. The title "Diurnal," or "Perfect Diurnal." did not necessarily imply a daily publication. The Perfect Occurrences of Every Day's Journal was printed at first once a month, and afterwards weekly. The Diary or Exact Journal was a weekly paper, notwithstanding its name. The small newspapers of that day were numerous, and apparently there was much rivalry among them. The titles were often quite similar, and perhaps sometimes indicate the same paper at different periods. Mercuries were most common, with the addition of a distinctive appellation. Thus, in 1643, there were Mercurius Rusticus, Mercurius Civicus, Mercurius Aulicus, Wednesday's Mercury, Mercurius Britannicus, The Welsh Mercury, Mercurius Cambro-Britannus; in 1644, Mercurius Civicus, The Court Mercury, &amp;c.; in 1645, Mercurius Veridicus, Mercurius Americanus (perhaps but one number) Mercurius Academicus; in 1646 Mercurius Candidus, Mercurius Diutinus; in 1647, Mercurius Populus, Mercurius Anti-Pragmaticus, Mercurius Elencticus, Mercurius Rusticus, Mercurius Melancholicus, Mercurius Bellicus, Mercurius Dogmaticus, Mercurius Pragmaticus, &amp;c. Other titles were: The Kingdom's Weekly Intelligencer, The Parliamentary Scout, The True Informer, The Compleat Intelligencer, Informator Rusticus, The Kingdom's Weekly Post, The Weekly Account, The Scottish Dove, The Spie, all of 1643; The Perfect Occurrences, The Spie from Oxford, A True and Perfect Journal, News from beyond Seas, The Flying Post, The London Post, The Country Foot Post, The Country Messenger, all of 1644. The Moderate Intelligencer, A Diary or Exact Journal (weekly), The Parliament's Post, The Exchange Intelligencer, The City Scout, The Kingdom's Scout, The City's Weekly Post, The Phœnix of Europe, Perfect Occurrences of Parliament, Perfect Passages of Each Dayes Proceedings in Parliament, all of 1645.

Private memoranda.—H.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX B. [Page 15.] The following account of the fire in Boston, in the year 1711, was written by the Rev. Dr. Cotton Mather. "Beginning about seven o'clock in the evening, and finishing before two in the morning, the night between the second and third of October, 1711, a terrible fire laid the heart of Boston, the metropolis of New-English America, in ashes. The occasion of the fire is said to have been by the carelessness of a sottish woman, who suffered a flame, which took the oakum, the picking whereof was her business, to gain too far before it could be mastered. It was not long before it reduced Cornhill into miserable ruins, and it made its impressions into King-Street and Queen-Street, and a great part of Pudding-lane was also lost, before the violence of it could be conquered. Among these ruins, there were two spacious edifices, which until now, made a most considerable figure, because of the public relation to our greatest solemnities in which they had stood from the days of our fathers. The one was the town-house; the other the old meeting-house. The number of houses, and some of them very capacious buildings, which went into the fire, with these, is computed near about a hundred; and the families, which inhabited these houses, cannot but be very many more. It being also a place of much trade, and filled with well-furnished shops of goods, not a little of the wealth of the town was now consumed. But that which very much added to the horror of the dismal night, was the tragical death of many poor men who were killed by the blowing up of houses, or by venturing too far into the fire, for the rescue of what its fierce jaws were ready to prey upon. Of these the bones of seven or eight are thought to be found; and it is feared there may be some strangers, belonging to vessels, besides these, thus buried, of whose unhappy circumstances we are not yet apprised; and others have since died of their wounds. Thus the town of Boston, just going to get beyond four score years of age, and conflicting with much labour and sorrow, is, a very vital and valuable part of it, soon cut off and flown away." In the single number of the attempted newspaper, dated Boston, Sept. 25, 1690, is an account of a fire in that city which may properly be introduced here if it were only for its record of the destruction of the best printing press in the country; but the disastrous conflagration which has occurred while these pages are passing through the press, and the remarkable preservation once more of the South Meeting House, add a special interest to it.—H. "Altho' Boston did a few weeks ago meet with a Disaster by Fire, which consumed about twenty Houses near the Mill Creek, yet about midnight, between the sixteenth and seventeenth of this Instant, another Fire broke forth near the South Meeting-House, which consumed about five or six houses, and had almost carried the meeting house itself, one of the fairest Edifices in the Country, if God had not remarkably assisted the Endeavors of the People to put out the fire. There were two more considerable Circumstances in the Calamities of this Fire; one was that a young man belonging to the House where the Fire began unhappily perished in the Flames; it seems that tho' he might sooner awake than some others who did escape yet he some way lost those Wits that should have taught him to help himself. Another was that the best furnished Printing Press of those few that we know of in America was lost—a loss not presently to be repaired."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX C. [Page 17.] As this was the first skirmish between printers of newspapers in this country, I will give the following particulars respecting it, which are extracted from the News-Letter and the Gazette. William Brooker, who succeeded Campbell in the post office, had, in an advertisement, mentioned his appointment; and that Campbell was removed from office; this gave offence to Campbell, who endeavored to make it appear that he was not removed. Brooker then published, in No. 4 of the Gazette, the following, to substantiate what he had asserted respecting Campbell. It was inserted in a large type and filled nearly one half of the Gazette. Post Office, January 11th, 1719. "The good Manners and Caution that has been observed in writing this Paper, 'twas hoped would have prevented any occasion for Controversies of this kind: But finding a very particular Advertisement published by Mr. Campbell in his Boston News-Letter of the 4th Currant, lays me under an absolute Necessity of giving the following Answer thereunto. Mr Campbell begins in saying, The Nameless Author—Intimating as if the not mentioning the Author's Name was a fault; But if he will look over the Papers wrote in England (such as the London Gazette, Post-Man, and other Papers of Reputation) he will find their Authors so. As this part of his Advertisement is not very material, I shall say no more thereon; but proceed to Matters of more Moment. Mr. Campbell seems somewhat displeased that the Author says he was removed from being Post-Master. I do hereby declare I was the Person that wrote the said Preamble, as he calls it; and think I could not have given his being turn'd out a softer Epithet. And to convince him (and all Mankind) that it was so, I shall give the following Demonstrations of it. Many Months before John Hamilton, Esq; Deputy Post-Master General of North America displaced the said Mr. Campbell, he received Letters from the Secretary to the Right Honourable the Post-Master General of Great Britain, &amp;c., that there had been several Complaints made against him, and therefore the removal of him from being Post-Master was, thought necessary. Mr. Hamilton for some time delayed it, till on the 13th of September 1718, he appointed me to succeed him, with the same Salary and other just Allowances, according to the Establishment of the Office; and if Mr. Campbell had any other, they were both unjust and unwarrantable, and he ought not to mention them. As soon as I was put into possession of the Office, Mr. Hamilton wrote a Letter to the Right Honourable the Post-Master General, acquainting them he had removed Mr. Campbell and appointed me in his room—Mr. Campbell goes on; saying, I was superceded by Mr. Musgrave from England. To make him appear also mistaken in this Point; Mr. Hamilton not displacing him as soon as was expected, the Right Honourable the Post-Master General appointed Mr. Philip Musgrave by their Deputation dated June 27, 1718, to be their Deputy Post-Master of Boston; and in a Letter brought by him from the Right Honourable the Post-Master General to John Hamilton Esq; mention is made, that for the many Complaints that were made against Mr. Campbell, they had thought it fit to remove him, and appoint Mr. Musgrave in his stead, who was nominated Post-Master of Boston almost three months before I succeeded Mr Campbell, which has obliged me to make it appear that he was either removed, turned out, displaced, or superceded Twice. The last thing I am to speak to is, Mr. Campbell says, It is amiss to represent, that People remote have been prevented from having the News-Paper. I do pray he will again read over my Introduction, and then he will find there is no words there advanced, that will admit of such an Interpretation. There is nothing herein contained but what is unquestionably True; therefore I shall take my leave of him, wishing him all desireable Success in his agreeable News-Letter, assuring him I have neither Capacity nor Inclination, to answer any more of his like Advertisements. "William Brooker." To the foregoing Campbell made this answer in the News-Letter of Jan. 18, 1719–20, viz. "Perhaps a long Reply may be expected from the Publisher of this Intelligence to the Introductions of his Successor's News, especially No. 4, the first Page whereof is almost filled with unjust Reflections, unworthy either of his trouble to Answer, or the Candid unprejudiced Readers to hear; who only affirms he was not turn'd out, but resigned voluntarily in December, 1717, two years before their first News Paper, and continued nine Months afterward, till the 13th of September, 1718, Fifteen Months before their first News, when the Deputy Post-Master General had provided another." No. 6. of Bos. Gaz. contains Brooker's reply, which is as follows, ? Since against plain matter of Fact, Mr. Campbell has charged me a second time with unjust Reflections, unworthy either his Trouble to answer, or the Unprejudiced Reader to hear, I do again Affirm he was turn'd out, notwithstanding his pretended Resignation: And I hope he will not oblige me (against my Inclination) to say Things which perhaps may be a greater Reflection on his Candour, and to his Ears, then to the Unprejudiced Reader's.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX E. [Page 48.] The following is a copy of the proceedings of the Governor and Council of Massachusetts, respecting the paragraph published by Fleet, March 8th, 1741. It shows the difference between what was then, and what is now, judged to be the "liberty of the press." "At a Council held at the Council Chamber in Boston, upon Tuesday the 9th day of March, 1741. "Whereas there is published in the Weekly Paper called the Boston Evening-Post of yesterday's Date, a Paragraph in the following Words: "Last Saturday Capt. Gibbs arrived here from Madeira, who informs, that before he left that Island, Capt. Dandridge, in one of his Majesty's ships of forty Guns, came in there from England, and gave an Account, that the Parliament had called for all the Papers relating to the War, and 'twas expected the Right Hon. Sir Rober Walpole would be taken into Custody in a very few Days.—Capt. Dandridge was going upon the Virginia Station to relieve the valiant and vigilant Knight there, almost wore out in the Service of his Country, and for which he has a Chance to be rewarded with a Flag." Which Paragraph contains a scandalous and libellous Reflection upon his Majesty's Administration, and may tend very much to inflame the Minds of his Majesty's Subjects here and disaffect them to his Government;" "Therefore, Ordered, That the Attorney General do, as soon as may be, file an informatian against Thomas Fleet, the Publisher of the said Paper, in his Majerty's Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize and General Gaol Delivery, in order to his being prosecuted for his said Offence as Law and Justice requires.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX F. [Page 49.] In the Evening-Post of November 7, 1748, Fleet inserted this advertisement viz: "Choice Pennsylvania Tobacco Paper, to be Sold by the Publisher of this Paper, at the Heart &amp; Crown; where may also be had the BULLS or Indulgencies of the present Pope Urban VIII, either by the single Bull, Quire or Ream, at a much cheaper Rate than they can be purchased of the French or Spanish Priests, and yet will be warranted to be of the same Advantage to the Possessors." These Bulls, or indulgences, of his holiness, were printed on the face of a small sheet; several bales of them were taken in a Spanish ship, captured by an English Cruiser, and sent into Boston during the war between England and France and Spain, in 1748. I have one of them now in my possession. Fleet purchased a very large quantity at a low price, and printed various editions of ballads on the backs of them. One side of the sheet was blank, and the paper very good; one bull answered for two half sheet ballads, or songs such as "Black Eyed Susan"—"Handsome Harry"—"Teague's Ramble to the Camp," &amp;c. I have seen large quantities of them which were thus worked up by Fleet. St. Mery, in his description of the Spanish part of Saint Domingo, writes, that in the Spanish Indies, "there is a tribunal, or establishment, for religious matters, but which at least has neither terrors nor torments; this is the holy crusade (santa cruzada), a name taken from a bull, the original object of which was to give indulgences to all those who should make offerings of money, or of their arms, to be employed against the infidels. At present it is more than a crusade purely spiritual, it is in reality neither more nor less than a tax, though it appears at the option of every one to refuse to purchase the bull, but it offers so much good for so low a price, and the neglecting to procure it indicates an indifference so bordering on unbelief, that every one, even the ecclesiasticks, purchases the celestial treasures, and with them the liberty of eating meat, eggs and milk, during the meagre days of Lent, provided he be authorised by the opinion of his doctor and confessor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX G. [Page 63.] The following paragraphs respecting the piece over the signature of Mucius Scævola, published in the Massachusetts Spy, No. 37, November 14, 1771, are extracted from the Evening Post and the Gazette, of the Monday following. "We hear that at a council held at the Council Chamber last Saturday, a piece signed Mucius Scævola, published in the Massachusetts Spy of November 14th, printed by Isaiah Thomas, was taken into consideration, when it was unanimously ordered, that the Attorney General be directed to prosecute the publisher thereof.—It is said the piece referred to above (from its nature, and tendency), is the most daring production ever published in America."—Boston Evening Post." "On Friday last, in the afternoon, his Excellency the Governor laid before the Council for their advice thereon, a paper in the Massachusetts Spy of Thursday, signed Mucius Scævola, said to contain divers seditious expressions, &amp;c. The council after debating till sundown adjourned till the next day, when they met again and sent for the printer, who in answer to the summons, told the messenger he was busy in his office, and should not attend: Upon which it is said a motion was made for his commitment to prison for contempt— but did not obtain. Whether the abundant lenity of the honourable Board, or from their having no legal authority in the case, has not yet transpired to us.—The final result was, their unanimous advice to the Governour to order the King's Attorney to prosecute the Printer at Common-Law."—Boston Gazette. Joseph Greenleaf, a justice of the peace for the county of Plymouth, being suspected of having some concern, either as a writer, or otherwise, in The Massachusetts Spy, received a summons of the purport following, which he laid before the public in the Spy of November 22, 1771. "Province of Massachusetts Bay—To Joseph Greenleaf, of Boston, in said province, Esq.— "You are required to appear before the Governor and Council, at the Council-chamber in Boston, on Tuesday the tenth day of December next, at ten of the clock in the forenoon, then and there to be examined touching a certain paper called the Massachusetts Spy, published the fourteenth day of November, 1771; whereof you are not to fail at your peril. Dated at Boston, the 16th day of November, 1771. "By order of the Governor, with the advice of Council, Thomas Flucker, Secretary." Greenleaf did not obey the summons, and on the 12th of December following, the Boston News-Letter, [Court Gazette] contained the proceedings of the Governor and Council of the 10th of that month in consequence thereof, viz. "At a Council held at the Council Chamber in Boston, Tuesday, December 10th, 1771. His Excellency having acquainted the Board at their last meeting, that Joseph Greenleaf, Esq; a Justice of the Peace for the county of Plymouth, was generally reputed to be concerned with Isaiah Thomas, in printing and publishing a News-Paper, called the Massachusetts Spy, and the said Joseph Greenleaf having thereupon been summoned to attend the board on this day, in order to his examination touching the same, and not attending according to summons, it was thereupon unanimously advised, that the said Joseph Greenleaf be dismissed from the office of a Justice of the Peace, which advice was approved of and consented to by his Excellency; and the said Joseph Greenleaf is dismissed from the said office accordingly. "A true copy from the minutes of Council. "Thomas Flucker, Secretary." The following fact I relate, principally with a view to show that one of the most eminent patriots, who was concerned in achieving our revolution, and of whose love for his country many instances are recorded, although he was so unfortunate as to become mentally deranged, yet he still retained his political integrity, and his amor patriæ was not extinguished. The Hon. James Otis was a lawyer of great note and distinction. Under him the late president of the United States, Mr. Adams, studied law, and became qualified for the bar. Mr. Otis's great misfortune originated in a dispute with Mr. Robinson, one of the commissioners of the customs in Boston. The unhappy disagreement terminated in an affray, in which Mr. Otis received a blow on his head, which occasioned, through the remainder of his life, lucid intervals excepted, a derangement of his intellects. During those intervals he still paid considerable attention to politics. On account of his disorder he was put under the care of a physician at Andover, and, at that place, in May, 1783, whilst leaning on his cane, at the door of a house, "he was struck by a flash of lightning, which instantly liberated his spirit from its shattered tenement."1 1 American Biographical Dictionary. Mr. Adams was in France when this fatal occurrence took place; but he there heard of the death of the unfortunate Otis; and, on that occasion, wrote to a friend in America, as follows: "It is with very afflicting sentiments I learned the death of Mr. Otis, my worthy master. Extraordinary in death as in life, he has left a character that will never die whilst the American revolution remains, whose foundation he laid with an energy and with masterly abilities which no other man possessed." I have mentioned the consequences which resulted from the publication of Mucius Scævola; but, notwithstanding I, afterward, ventured to republish some very strong addresses to the king, which had appeared in English papers. These addresses were very offensive to the officers of the crown, and produced considerable agitation. A prosecution was expected to take place; and, I was informed by some friends, on whose intelligence I thought I could place full reliance, that Governor Hutehinson had said, that, "in order to secure a verdict against rue stronger ground would be taken than in the case of Mucius Scævola." Some weeks before the most obnoxious of these addresses appeared in the Massachusetts Spy, Mr. Otis, who was then under the influence of his disorder, called at my house one evening, and desired to have a private conference with me in what he called "my sanctum sanctorum;" meaning a private apartment,1 1 Called by the tories, "The Sedition Foundry." adjoining the printing rooms, up two pair of stairs. The workmen had retired, and we ascended to the place he mentioned; where being seated in due form, he demanded two sheets of paper and scissors, which I presented to him. He doubled each sheet, and after putting them together, in a formal manner, indented them at the top. On one of the sheets of paper he wrote his private signature, and demanded my countersign on the other, which I gave him. He folded it carefully, deposited it in his pocket, left the other with me and having assured me I should hear from him, he departed. From this period I had no communication of any kind with Mr. Otis, until the report of a prosecution, on account of publishing the addresses to the king, became very prevalent. On that occasion he again appeared, and was apparently perfectly composed, and in the undisturbed possession of reason. He informed me, that he had heard much of my having published an address to the king; and that in consequence, a prosecution seemed to impend, in terrorem, over me. As he had not seen the address in question, I handed him the paper which contained it; and, sitting down, he read it very attentively. After reading it once, he went over the same again, paragraph by paragraph, repeating at the end of each, "There is no treason in that." When he came to the strongest passage, he paused—read it again and again—and, after pondering upon it some time, he exclaimed, "Touch and go, by G—." Having read the address entirely through the second time, he civilly assured me that, on due consideration, he was convinced the whole of it was defensible, and that in case the prosecution should take place, he would voluntarily come forward in my defence, without fee or reward; or, would point out to my counsel the ground of defence, which, in his opinion, ought to be taken. He appeared to be animated by the subject to such a degree as produced some agitation; but on taking leave he said, "James Otis still retains some knowledge of law." The projected prosecution fell to the ground, and I saw Mr. Otis no more.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX H. [Page 98.] During the troubles occasioned by the revolution when William and Mary ascended the throne of England, Captain Jacob Leisler, was appointed, by the general assembly of New York, governor thereof, till the king's pleasure should be known. This appointment was, afterwards, in July, 1689, confirmed by the king. In the month of January following, Captain Richard Ingoldsby arrived at New York, and, "without producing any legal authority," demanded of Leisler the surrender of the fort in that city, which demand was not complied with, and Leisler kept possession of the fort till the arrival of a new governor, Colonel Sloughter, in March 1690, when the fort was immediately surrendered to him by Leisler. In 1691, the new general assembly of the province resolved, that Leisler during his administration was guilty of certain high crimes and misdemeanors, which were particularized; the principal charge against him was, his refusal to deliver up the fort to Ingoldsby. In consequence of this proceeding of the general assembly, Leisler and two others, viz. Jacob Milborne and Abraham Gouverneur, were arraigned in the supreme court, convicted and attainted of high treason and felony, "for not delivering up the fort to Ingoldsby," and they were all executed. An act of parliament was passed the 12th of November, 1694, "for reversing the attainder" of these unfortunate gentlemen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX I. [Page 106.] A paper addressed "To the Betrayed Inhabitants of New York," signed "A Son of Liberty", was printed privately in Parker's printing house, in December, 1769. This paper was laid before the general assembly, which resolved that it was "a false, seditious and infamous libel;" and, in an address, requested the lieutenant governor, to issue his proclamation, offering a reward of one hundred pounds, New York currency, for the discovery of the author. A journeyman in Parker's printing house, one Michael Cummings, from Cork, in Ireland, allured by the proffered reward, lodged a complaint against Parker, as the printer; in consequence of which, he was taken into custody, on the 7th of January, 1770, by virtue of a warrant from the chief justice Horsemanden, in which he was charged with being the printer of the libel, and made amenable, before the lieutenant governor and council, to be examined concerning the premises. This process was strictly executed. While he was detained in a course of examination, before the lieutenant governor and the council, the sheriff returned to Parker's house, and took all his apprentices into custody, and immediately conducted them to the lieutenant governor and council. Upon their entrance, their master, who had not the least opportunity of seeing them after he was arrested, was ordered into another apartment under the custody of the sheriff, and was not present at their examination. The eldest apprentice was first examined, and the paper in question being produced, he was asked whether he had seen it before? To which he answered, that he had frequently seen it, as printed copies of it had been dispersed about the city. He further alleged, that, though repeatedly pressed to declare whether it was printed at his master's printing house, he refused to make any such declaration. But at length being threatened with a commitment, he confessed that it was printed by Parker; and, at the same time, assured the lieutenant governor and council that he was ignorant who was the author. The younger apprentices corroborated his evidence; after which they were all dismissed. Further proof being thus procured against Parker, he was again brought before the lieutenant governor and council, and reexamined on the subject; and though he repeatedly refused to discover the author, yet being at length wrought upon by threats, that application would be made to his superiors to procure his dismission from his employment in the postoffice, and that he must either give bail or be committed, unless he would discover the author; and, not having had it in his power to consult with the author about an indemnification from him, he resolved to make the discovery, provided he could procure an engagement on the part of the government, that he should not be prosecuted. This indemnity his honor and the council, after some consideration, thought proper to give to him; upon which he submitted to an examinatian on oath, and was discharged upon his single recognizance, to appear and give evidence against General Alexander MacDougall, whom he charged as being the author of the paper in question. Early the next morning the sheriff went to the house of MacDougall, and took him into custody, on a warrant issued by his honor the chief justice, wherein he was charged with causing the paper to be printed, which in the warrant was said to be a "false, seditious, and infamous Libel;" and the sheriff, according to the command of the precept, conducted him to the chief justice's chamber, to be examined concerning the premises, and to be dealt with according to law. When MacDougall was brought into the chamber of the chief justice, his honor said to him, " So you have brought yourself into a pretty scrape." To which MacDougall replied, "May it please your honor, that must be judged of by my peers." The chief justice then told MacDougall, "that there was full proof that he was the author, or publisher, of the above mentioned paper, which he called a "false, vile, and scandalous libel." MacDougall again replied, "this must also be tried by my peers." His honor thereupon informed him "that he must either give bail, or go to gaol." To which MacDougall replied, "Sir, I will give no bail." His honor then ordered the sheriff to take him to gaol, and made out a mittimus charging him with being the author and publisher of a "certain false, scandalous, seditious and infamous paper, addressed "to the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York," and subscribed, "A Son of Liberty;" and commanding the sheriff "therewith to receive him, and safely keep him in gaol, until he should thence be delivered by due course of law." MacDougall remained in prison till April term following, when the grand jury found a bill against him, as the author of a libel against the general assembly; but it being late in the term, the trial was put off till another session, and MacDougall was admitted to bail. Before the next term, Parker died, and of course the evidence against MacDougall was lost. In consequence of which, MacDougall on the 13th of December, 1770, was, by an order of the assembly, taken before that body by the sergeant at arms, and placed at the bar of the house; he was then informed by the speaker, that he was charged by a member of that house, with being the author of the libel before mentioned, and that he was by an order of the house to answer to the question, "Whether he was guilty or not." MacDougall asked who were his accusers, and what evidence was adduced against him? These were questions for which the house was not prepared; and MacDougall was interrupted by Mr. De Noyellis, who was supported by the speaker. The latter informed MacDougall that he had no right to speak until he had obtained leave of the house. After some objections and difficulties had been surmounted, MacDougall obtained leave to state his reasons why he ought not to answer the question put to him, or the charge against him. He declined answering it for two reasons which rendered it improper for him to do so. One was, because the paper which had just been read to him, was declared by the honorable house to be a libel; the grand jury of the city and county of New York had also declared it to be libellous, and found a bill of indictment against him, as the author of it. The second reason arose from the fact, that the honorable house had addressed the lieutenant governor to issue his proclamation, offering a reward of one hundred pounds for discovering the author or publisher of the paper signed "A Son of Liberty," in order that he might be proceeded against according to law; in consequence whereof information had been given; and a prosecution against him was then pending before the supreme court, where he should be tried by a jury of his peers. He stated further, that as the honorable house was a party in the question, the prosecution being commenced at the instance and recommendation thereof, he conceived it ought not to take cognizance of the matter; and questioned if any precedent could be found on the journals of the house of commons, to shew it had taken cognizance of any supposed libel, when the reputed author of it was under prosecution. Such a proceeding would be an infraction of the laws of England, which forbid that any British subject should be punished twice for the same offence. For these reasons MacDougall declined either to affirm or to deny anything respecting the paper before the house. A debate arose in which Mr. De Noyellis insisted that the house had the same power to make a person accused deny or acknowledge a fact, as the courts below had to oblige a prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty. This doctrine was opposed by Mr. Clinton; who said the house had the power to throw the accused over the bar, or out at the window—but the public would judge of the action. It was finally agreed to call in evidence as to the facts, whether a prosecution, against MacDougall had been instituted, and to determine if the house was a party to the prosecution. A dispute arose about the manner of entering MacDougall's two reasons on the journals. He conceived justice had not been done to the second; and after some debate, he was ordered to commit it to writing. It was contended by the speaker, and several other members, that his written, statement reflected on the honor and dignity of the house. After the subject had been debated, it was decided that he was guilty of a breach of the privileges of that house, and he was ordered to ask pardon of the same. With this order MacDougall refused to comply, alleging that he had not been guilty of any crime; and he asserted, that rather than resign the rights and privileges of a British subject, he would suffer his right hand to be cut off at the bar of the house. He was committed to prison by the sergeant at arms, where he remained several months.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX J. [Page 110.] By Philip Freneau. City of New York, January 1st, 1783. To the Senate of York, with all due submission, Of honest Hugh Gaine, the humble Petition; An Account of his Life he will also prefix, At least what was previous to Seventy-Six; He hopes that your honours will take no offence, If he sends you some groans of contrition from hence; And further to prove that he's truly sincere, He wishes you all a Happy New Year. And first he informs, in his representation, That he once was a printer of good reputation, And dwelt in the street called Hanover Square, (You'll know where it is if you ever were there) Next door to the dwelling of Doctor Browne-John (Who now to the drug-shop of Pluto is gone) But what do I say—whoe'er came to town, And knew not Hugh Gaine at the Bible and Crown? Now, if I were ever so given to lie, My dear native country I would'nt deny; (I know you love Teagues) and I shall not conceal That I came from the kingdom where Phelim O'Neale, And other brave worthies, ate butter and cheese, And walk'd in the clover fields up to their knees. Full early in youth without basket or burden, With a staff in my hand I passed over Jordan, (I remember my comrade was Doctor Magraw, And many strange things on the waters we saw, Sharks, dolphins, and sea-dogs, bonettas and whales, And birds at the tropick with quills in their tails). And came to your city and government seat, And found it was true you had something to eat: When thus I wrote home—"The country is good, " They have plenty of victuals and plenty of wood; " The people are kind, and whate'er they may think, " I shall make it appear I can swim where they'll sink; " And yet they're so brisk, and so full of good cheer, " By my soul I suspect they have always new year, " And therefore conceive 'It is good to be here'"} So said, and so acted, I put up a press, And printed away with amazing success; Neglected my person, and look'd like a fright, Was bothered all day, and was busy all night, Saw money come in as the papers went out, While Parker and Weyman were driving about, And cursing, and swearing, and chewing their cuds, And wishing Hugh Gaine and his press in the suds. Ned Weyman was printer you know to the king, And thought he had got all the world in a string; (Tho' riches not always attend on a throne) For he swore I had found the philosopher's stone, And call'd me a rogue and a son of a b—ch, Because I knew better than he to get rich! To malice like that 'twas in vain to reply— You had known by his looks he was telling a lie. Thus life ran away, so smooth and serene— Ah, these were the happiest days I had seen! But the saying of Jacob I've found to be true, " The days of thy servant are evil and few!" The days that to me were joyous and glad, Are nothing to those which are dreary and sad! The feuds of the Stamp-Act foreboded foul weather, And war and vexation all coming together: Those days were the days of riots and mobs, Tar, feathers, and tories, and troublesome jobs; Priests preaching up war for the good of our souls, And libels, and lying, and Liberty-Poles, From which, when some whimsical colours you wav'd, We had nothing to do, but look up and be sav'd— (You thought by resolving to terrify Britain— Indeed, if you did, you were damnably bitten.) I knew it would bring an eternal reproach, When I saw you a burning Cadwallader's1 1 Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden. coach; I knew you would suffer for what you had done, When I saw you lampooning poor Sawney his son, And bringing him down to so wretched a level, As to ride him about in a cart with the devil. Well, as I predicted that matters would be,— To the stamp act succeeded a tax upon Tea; What chests full were scatter'd, and trampled, and drown'd, And yet the whole tax was but three pence per pound! May the hammer of Death on my noddle descend, And Satan torment me to time without end, If this was a reason to fly into quarrels, And feuds that have ruin'd our manners and morals; A parson himself might have sworn round the compass, That folks for a trifle should make such a rumpus, Such a rout as to set half the world in a rage, Make France, Spain and Holland with Britain engage, While the Emperor, the Swede, the Russ, and the Dane, All pity John Bull—and run off with his gain. But this was the season that I must lament— I first was a whig with an honest intent, Not a fellow among them talk'd louder, or bolder, With his sword by his side, or his gun on his shoulder; Yes, I was a whig, and a whig from my heart, But still was unwilling with Britain to part— I thought to oppose her was foolish and vain, I thought she would turn and embrace us again, And make us as happy as happy could be, By renewing the era of mild Sixty Three: And yet, like a cruel undutiful son, Who evil returns for the good to le done. Unmerited odium on Britain to throw, I printed some treason for Philip F—neau, Some damnable poems reflecting on Gage, The King and his Council, and writ with such rage, So full of invective, and loaded with spleen, So sneeringly smart, and so hellishly keen, That, at least in the judgment of half our wise men, Alecto herself made the nib to his pen. At this time arose a certain King Sears, Who made it his study to banish our fears! He was, without doubt, a person of merit, Great knowledge, some wit, and abundance of spirit; Could talk like a lawyer, and that without fee, And threaten'd perdition to all who drank Tea. Ah! don't you remember what a vigorous hand he put, To drag off the great guns, and plague Captain Vandeput?1 1 Captain of the Asia man of war. That night when the hero (his patience worn out) Put fire to his cannons and folks to the rout, And drew up his ship with a spring on her cable, And gave us a second confusion of Babel. And (what was more solid than scurrilous language) Pour'd on us a tempest of round shot and langrage: Scarce a broadside was ended 'till another began again— By Jove! it was nothing but "Fire away Flannagan!"2 2 A cant phrase among privateers men. At first we suppos'd it was only a sham, Till he drove a round ball through the roof of Black Sam;3 3 A noted tavern keeper in New York. The town by his flashes was fairly enlighten'd, The women miscarry'd, the beaus were all frightened; For my part, I hid in a cellar (as sages And Christians were wont in the primitive ages: Thus the Prophet of old that was wrapt to the sky, Lay snug in a cave 'till the tempest went by, But as soon as the comforting spirit had spoke, He rose and came out with his mystical cloke) Yet I hardly could boast of a moment of rest, The dogs were a howling, the town was distrest! But our terrors soon vanish'd, for suddenly Sears Renew'd our lost courage and dry'd up our tears. Our memories, indeed, must have strangely decay'd If we cannot remember what speeches he made, What handsome harangues upon every occasion, How he laugh'd at the whim of a British Invasion! P-x take 'em (said he) Do you think they will come? If they should—we have only to beat on our drum, And run up the flag of American Freedom, And people will muster by millions to bleed 'em! What Freeman need value such black-guards as these? Let us sink in our channel some Cheveaux de Frize. And then let 'em come—and we'll shew 'em fair play— But they are not madmen—I tell you—not they! From this very day 'till the British came in We lived, I may say, in the Desert of Sin— Such beating and bruising and scratching and tearing, Such kicking and cuffing, and cursing and swearing! But when they advanc'd with their numerous fleet, And Washington made his nocturnal retreat, (And which they permitted, I say, to their shame, Or else your New Empire had been but a name) We townsmen, like women, of Britons in dread, Mistrusted their meaning and foolishly fled; Like the rest of the dunces I mounted my steed, And gallop'd away with incredible speed. To Newark I hasten'd—but trouble, and care, Got up on the crupper, and follow'd me there! There I scarcely got fuel to keep myself warm, And scarcely found spirits to weather the storm; (And was quickly convinc'd, I had little to do, The whigs, were in arms, and my readers were few); So after remaining one cold winter's season, And stuffing my papers with something like treason, And meeting misfortunes and endless disasters, And forc'd to submit to a hundred new masters, I thought it more prudent to hold to the one— And (after repenting for what I had done, And cursing my folly, and idle pursuits) Return'd to the city and hung up my boots. As matters have gone, it was plainly a blunder, But then I expected the whigs must knock under, And I always adhere to the sword that is longest, And stick to the party that's like to be strongest; That you have succeeded is merely a chance, I never once dreampt of the conduct of France!— If alliance with her you were promis'd—at least} You ought to have show'd me your star in the East, Not let me go off uninformed as a beast. When your army I saw without stockings or shoes, Or victuals—or money to pay them their dues, (Excepting your wretched congressional paper, That stunk in my nose like the snuff of a taper, A cart load of which for a dram might be spent all, That da—able bubble the old continental, That took people in at this wonderful crisis, With its mottos and emblems, and cunning devices; Which, bad as it was, you were forc'd to admire, And which was, in fact, the pillar of fire, To which you directed your wandering noses, Like the Jews in the desert, conducted by Moses); When I saw them attended with famine and fear, Distress in their front and Howe in their rear; When I saw them for debt incessantly dunn'd, Not a shilling to pay them laid up in your fund; Your ploughs at a stand, and your ships run ashore; When this was apparent, (and need I say more)? I handled my cane, and I look'd at my hat, And cry'd—"G—d have mercy on armies like that!" I took up my bottle, disdaining to stay, And said—"Here's a health to the Vicar of Bray,"} And cock'd up my beaver and strutted away. Asham'd of my conduct, I sneak'd into town, (Six hours and a quarter the sun had been down) It was, I remember, a cold frosty night, And the stars in the firmament glitter'd as bright, As if, (to assume a poetical stile) Old Vulcan had lent them a rub with his file. Till this cursed night, I can honestly say, I ne'er before dreaded the dawn of the day; Not a wolf or a fox that is caught in a trap, E'er was so asham'd of his nightly mishap. I cou'dn't help thinking what ills might befal me, What rebels and rascals the British would call me, And how I might suffer in credit and purse, If not in my person, which still had been worse: At length I resolv'd (as was surely my duty) To go for advice to parson Auchmuty: (The parson, who now I hope is in glory, Was then upon earth, and a terrible tory. Not Cooper himself, of ideas perplext, So nicely could handle and torture a text, When bloated with lies thro' his trumpet he sounded The da—ble sin of resisting a crown'd head.) Like a penitent sinner, and dreading my fate, In the grey of the morning I knock'd at his gate; (No doubt he was vex'd that I rous'd him so soon, For his worship was often in blankets 'till noon.) At length he approach'd in his vestments of black— (Alas my poor heart! it was then on the rack, Like a man in an ague, or one to be try'd; I shook, and recanted, and snivell'd, and sigh'd:) His gown of itself was amazingly big, Besides, he had on his canonical wig, And frown'd at a distance; but when he came near Look'd pleasant and said—"What, Hugh, are you here! Your heart, I am certain, is horribly harden'd, But if you confess, your sin will be pardon'd. In spite of my preachments, and all I could say, Like the prodigal son you wander'd away, Now tell me dear penitent, which is the best, To be with the rebels, pursu'd and distress'd, Devoid of all comfort, all hopes of relief. Or else to be here, and eat the King's beef? More people resemble the snake than the dove, And more are converted by terror than love: Like a sheep on the mountains, or rather a swine, You wander'd away from the ninety and nine; Awhile at the offers of mercy you spurn'd. But your error you saw, and at length have return'd! Our master will therefore consider your case, And restore you again to favor and grace, Great light shall arise from utter confusion, And rebels shall live to lament their delusion." " Ah rebels (said I) they are rebels indeed— Chastisement, I hope, by the King is decreed: They have hung up his subjects with bedcords and halters, And banish'd his prophets and thrown down his altars, And I—even I—while I ventur'd to stay, They sought for my life, to take it away! I therefore propose to come under your wing, A foe to Rebellion—a slave to the King." Such pitiful whining in scriptural style Work'd out my salvation, at least for a while; The parson pronounc'd me deserving of grace, And so they restored me to printing and place. But days such as these were too happy to last; The sand of felicity settled too fast! When I swore and protested I honor'd the throne, The least they could do was to let me alone; Tho' George I compar'd to an angel above, They wanted some solider proofs of my love; And so they oblig'd me each morning to come And turn in the ranks at the beat of the drum, While often, too often, (I tell it with pain) They menac'd my head with a hickory cane, While others, my betters, as much were opprest— But shame and confusion shall cover the rest. You doubtless will think I am dealing in fable, When I tell you I guarded an officer's stable— With usage like this my feelings are stung; The next thing will be, I must heave out the dung! Six hours in the day is duty too hard, And Rivington sneers whene'er I mount guard, And laughs 'till his sides are ready to split With his jests, and his satires, and sayings of wit: Because he's excus'd on account of his post, He cannot go by without making his boast, As if I was all that is servile and mean— But fortune perhaps may alter the scene, And give him his turn to stand in the street, Burnt brandy supporting his radical heat. But what for the King or the cause has he done, That we must be toiling while he can look on? Great conquests he gave them on paper, tis true, When Howe was retreating, he made him pursue. From hence you may guess I do nothing but grieve, And where we are going I cannot conceive— The wisest among us a change are expecting, It is not for nothing these ships are collecting, It is not for nothing that Matthews, the mayor, And legions of tories, for sailing prepare; It is not for nothing that John Coghill Knapp Is filing his papers and plugging his tap; See Skinner himself, the fighting attorney, Is boiling potatoes to serve a long journey; But where they are going, or meaning to travel, Would puzzle John Faustus himself to unravel, Perhaps to Penobscot, to starve in the barrens, Perhaps to St. John, in the gulf of St. Lawrence; Perhaps to New-Scotland, to perish with cold, Perhaps to Jamaica, like slaves to be sold, Where scorch'd by the summer all nature repines, Where Phoebus, great Phoebus, too glaringly shines, And fierce from the zenith diverging his ray Distresses the isle with a torrent of day. Since matters are thus, with proper submission, Permit me to offer my humble petition; (Tho' the form is uncommon, and lawyers may sneer, With truth I can tell you, the scribe is sincere.) That, since it is plain we are going away, You will suffer Hugh Gaine unmolested to stay. His sand is near run (life itself is a span) So leave him to manage as well as he can: Who'er are his masters, or monarchs, or regents, For the future he'll promise to swear them allegiance; If the Turk with his turban should set up at last here While he gives him protection he'll own him his master And yield due obedience (when Britain is gone) Tho' rul'd by the sceptre of Presbyter John. My press that has call'd you (as tyranny drove her) Rogues, rebels, and rascals, a thousand times over, Shall be at your service by day and by night, To publish whate'er you think proper to write: Those types which have rais'd George the third to a level With angels—shall prove him as black as the devil, To him that contriv'd him a shame and disgrace, Nor blest with one virtue to honour his race! Who knows but, in time, I may rise to be great, And have the good fortune to manage a state? Great noise among people great changes denotes, And I shall have money to purchase their votes; The time is approaching, I'll venture to say, When folks of my stamp shall come into play, When the false hearted tory shall give himself airs, And rise to take hold of the helm of affairs, While the honest bold soldier that sought your renown, Like a dog in the dirt shall be crush'd and held down. Of honours and profits allow me a share! I frequently dream of a president's chair! And visions full often intrude on my brain, That for me to interpret would be rather vain! Blest seasons advance, when Britons shall find That they can be happy, and you can be kind, When rebels no longer at traitors shall spurn, When Arnold himself shall in triumph return! But my paper informs me its time to conclude. I fear my address has been rather too rude— If it has—for my boldness your pardon I pray, And further, at present, presume not to say, Except that (for form's sake) in haste I remain Your humble Petitioner—honest— Hugh Gaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX K. [Page 123.] The following from the pen of Mr. Freneau, amongst several other satirical essays, in verse and prose, appeared in the papers of the country, before, and at the close of the revolutionary war. On Mr. Rivington's new engraved King's Arms to his Royal Gazette, [Published May, 1782.] From the regions of night with his head in a sack, Ascended a person accoutred in black, And upwards directing his circular eye whites Like the Jure-divino political Levites, And leaning his elbow on Rivington's shelf While the printer was busy, thus mus'd with himself— "My mandates are fully comply'd with at last, New Arms are engraved, and new letters are cast; I therefore determine, and freely accord, This servant of mine shall receive his reward." Then turning about, to the printer he said, " Who late was my servant shall now be my aid; Since under my banners so bravely you fight, Kneel down! For your merits I dub you a Knight: From a passive subaltern I bid you to rise The INVENTOR, as well as the PRINTER, of Lies." RIVINGTON'S CONFESSIONS. Addressed to the Whigs of New York. Long life and low spirits were never my choice, As long as I live I intend to rejoice; When life is worn out, and no wine's to be had, 'Tis time enough then to be serious and sad. 'Tis time enough then to reflect and repent When our liquor is gone, and our money is spent; But I cannot endure what is practiced by some, This anticipating of mischiefs to come. A debt must be paid, I am sorry to say, Alike, in their turns, by the grave and the gay, And due to a despot that none can deceive, Who grants us no respite and signs no reprieve. Thrice happy is he that from care can retreat, And its plagues and vexations put under his feet; Blow the storm as it may he is always in trim, And the sun's in the zenith forever to him. Since the world then in earnest is nothing but care, (And the world will allow I have also my share) Yet toss'd as I am in the stormy expanse, The best way I find, is to leave it to chance. Look round if you please and survey the wide ball, And chance, you will find, has direction of all; 'Twas owing to chance that I first saw the light, And chance may destroy me before it is night! 'Twas a chance, a mere chance, that your arms gain'd the day, 'Twas a chance that the Britons so soon went away. To chance by their leaders the nation is cast, And chance to perdition will send them at last. Now because I remain when the puppies are gone, You would willingly see me hang'd, quarter'd and drawn; Though I think I have logic sufficient to prove That the chance of my stay is a proof of my love. For deeds of destruction some hundred are ripe, But the worst of my foes are your lads of the type: Because they have nothing to put on their shelves, They are striving to make me as poor as themselves. There's Loudon and Kollock, those strong bulls of Bashan, Are striving to hook me away from my station, And Holt1 1 Messrs. Holt, Loudon and Kollock, publishers of newspapers, and then lately removed to New York. all at once is as wonderful great, As if none but himself was to print for the state. Ye all are convinc'd I'd a right to expect That a sinner returning you would not reject— Quite sick of the scarlet and slaves of the throne, 'Tis now at your option to make me your own. Suppose I had gone with the tories and rabble, To starve or be drown'd on the shoals of Cape Sable; I had suffer'd, 'tis true—hut I'll have you to know, You nothing had gained by my trouble and woe. You say that with grief and dejection of heart I pack'd up my alls with a view to depart. That my shelves were dismantled, my cellars unstor'd, My boxes afloat, and my hampers on board: And hence you infer (I am sure without reason) That a right you possess to entangle my wezand— But whoever argued, where blood was not spilt, That terror of heart is conviction of guilt? The charge may be true—for I found it in vain To lean on a staff that was broken in twain, And ere I had gone at Port Roseway to fix, I had chose to sell drams on the margin of Styx: I confess, that with shame and contrition opprest, I sign'd an agreement to go with the rest; But ere they weigh'd anchor to sail their last trip, I saw they were vermin, and gave them the slip. Now, why should you call me the worst man alive, On the word of a convert I cannot contrive; Though turn'd a plain honest republican,'still You own me no proselyte, do what I will. My paper is alter'd—good people don't fret— I call it no longer the Royal Gazette; To me a great monarch has lost all his charms, I have pull'd down his Lion, and trampled his Arms. While fate was propitious, I thought they might stand, (You know I was zealous for George's command,) But since he disgrac'd it, and left us behind, If I thought him an angel, I've alter'd my mind. On the very same day that his army went hence, I ceas'd to tell lies for the sake of his pence; And what was the reason? the true one is best, I worship no suns when they hang to the west. In this I resemble a Turk or a Moor, Bright Phœbus ascending I prostrate adore; And therefore excuse me for printing some lays, An ode or a sonnet in Washington's praise. His prudence alone has preserv'd your dominions, This chief of all chiefs, and the pride of Virginians! And when he is gone—I pronounce it with pain— We scarcely shall meet with his equal again. Old Plato asserted that life is a dream, And man but a shadow, (whate'er he may seem) By which it is plain, he intended to say That man like a shadow must vanish away. If this be the fact, in relation to man, And if each one is striving to get what he can, I hope, while I live, you will all think it best To allow me to bustle along with the rest. A view of my life, though some parts might be solemn, Would make, on the whole, a ridiculous volume. In the life that's hereafter (to speak with submission) I hope I shall publish a better edition. Even swine you permit to subsist in the street; You pity a dog that lies down to be beat:— Then forget what is past—for the year's at a close— And men of my age have some need of repose. The following humorous address appeared in the public papers, soon after the revolutionary war ended. It is the production of the late Dr. Witherspoon of Philadelphia, and appears in his works. "SUPPLICATION OF J**** R********. "To his Excellency Henry Laurens, Esquire, President, and other the Members of the Honorable the American Congress, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. "The humble Representation and earnest Supplication of J. R—, Printer and Bookseller in New York, "Respectfully sheweth, "That a great part of the British forces has already left this city, and from many symptoms there is no reason to suspect, that the remainder will speedily follow them. Where they are gone, or going, is perhaps known to themselves, perhaps not; certainly, however, it is unknown to us, the loyal inhabitants of the place, and other friends of government who have taken refuge in it, and who are therefore filled with distress and terror on the unhappy occasion. That as soon as the evacuation is completed, it is more than probable, the city will be taken possession of by the forces of your high mightinesses, followed by vast crowds of other persons—whigs by nature and profession—friends to the liberties, and foes to the enemies of America. Above all, it will undoubtedly be filled with shoals of Yankies, that is to say, the natives and inhabitants, or as a great lady in this metropolis generally expresses it—the wretches of New-England. "That from several circumstances, there is reason to fear that the behavior of the wretches aforesaid, may not be altogether gentle to such of the friends of government as shall stay behind. What the governing powers of the state of New York may do also, it is impossible to foretell. Nay, who knows but we may soon see, in propria persona, as we have often heard of Hortensius, the Governor of New-Jersey, a gentleman remarkable for severely handling those whom he calls traitors, and indeed who has exalted some of them (quanquam animus meminisse horret luctu-que refugit) to a high, though dependent station, and brought America under their feet, in a sense very different from what Lord North meant when he first used that celebrated expression, That your petitioner in particular, is at the greatest loss what to resolve upon, or how to shape his course. He has no desire at all, either to be roasted in Florida, or frozen to death in Canada or Nova Scotia. Being a great lover of fresh cod, he has had thoughts of trying a settlement in Newfoundland, but recollecting that the New-England men have almost all the same appetite, he was obliged to relinquish that project entirely. If he should go to Great Britain, dangers no less formidable present themselves. Having been a bankrupt in London, it is not impossible that he might be accommodated with a lodging in Newgate, and that the ordinary there, might oblige him to say his prayers, a practice from which he hath had an insuperable aversion all his life long. In this dreadful dilemma, he hath at last determined to apply to your high mightinesses, and by this memorial to lay himself at your feet, which he assures you, is the true modish phrase for respectful submission, according to the present etiquette of the court. Being informed, however, that some of you are Presbyterians, and Religionists, he has been also at some pains to find out a scripture warrant or example for his present conduct, and has happily found it in the advice given by the servants of Benhadad, king of Syria, to their master, 1 Kings, xx. 31–82. And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: Let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee let me live. In like manner, O most mighty and venerable congress-men, your servant, J. R— saith, I pray you let me live. "Having thus preferred my petition, I must now entreat leave to lay before your high mightinesses, sundry reasons, which I hope will incline you to lend a favorable ear to it, in doing which, I shall use all possible plainness and candor. 1. In the first place, there cannot possibly be any danger to the United States in suffering me to live. I know many of you think and say, that a tory heart acquires such a degree of sourness and malevolence, in addition to its native stock, and such a habit of treachery, by breaking through the most endearing ties of nature, that no good can be expected from it, nor any dependence placed upon it, let pretences or appearances be what they will. I remember also, about seven years ago, a certain person hearing accidentally one or two paragraphs read from the writings of an eminent controversial divine in this country, said, That fellow must be a turncoat; it is impossible that he could have been educated in the profession which he now defends. What is your reason for that opinion? said another gentleman who was present—Because, says he, he discovers a rancor of spirit and rottenness of heart, unattainable by any other class of men. But I contend that these remarks relate only to the natives of this country, who like parricides took up arms for her destruction; and to apostates in religion; neither of which, I am certain, can be applied to me. I was born, as is well known, in old England; and as for the accusation of apostacy, I set it at defiance, unless a man can be said to fall off from what he was never on, or to depart from a place which he never saw. But what I beg of you particularly to observe is, that let the disposition to mischief be as great as you please, where the ability is wanting, there can be no danger. I have often seen the lions in the tower of London without fear, because there was an iron grate between me and them. Now it is certain that the tories in general would do any thing sooner than fight. Many of them became tories for no other reason than that they might avoid fighting. The poor chicken-hearted creatures cried out to the potent king of England, to take them under his wings for protection, which he endeavoured to do, but they were too short to cover them. Even the late petition for arms, in which they promised to go without the lines, and sweep you all away with the besom of destruction, was but an idle rhodomontade.—It was something like a poor boy shouting and singing in the dark, to keep himself from being afraid. At that very time, to my certain knowledge, they would have given the world for a place to fly to, out of the reach of Washington and Gates. But I return to myself, egomet sum proximus mihi. I can assure your high mightinesses, that no danger can arise from me, for I am as great a coward as King James VIth of Scotland, who could never see a naked sword without trembling; having been, as it is said, frightened in his mother's belly, when the fierce barons of that country came in and killed David Rizzio in her presence. I was once severely caned by a Scots officer now (if employed) in your service. Though the gentlemen of that choleric nation have been very much our friends in the present controversy, I find it is dangerous to offend them. Buchanan their own historian says, perfervidum est Scotorum ingenium. Therefore, by the by, or en passant, for I suppose you are at present best pleased with French phrases, I would advise every man who regards his own peace, however smooth and gentle a Scotchman may appear, not to take him against the hair, as the saying is in their own country, but to remember the motto that surrounds the thistle, Nemo me impune lacessit. I also very narrowly escaped a sound beating from a New-England parson, who was strong enough, without either cane or cudgel, to have pounded me to a mummy. All this, and much more of the same kind, I bore with the most exemplary patience and submission. Perhaps it will be said, that though no danger is to be apprehended from any deeds, yet I may do harm enough by words and writing. To this I answer, that I have expended and exhausted my whole faculty of that kind in the service of the English. I have tried falsehood and misrepresentation in every shape that could be thought of, so that it is like a coat thrice turned that will not hold a single stitch. My friend, Gen. Ro—n told me some time ago in my own shop, that I carried things so far that people could not believe one word I said, even though it were as true as the gospel. From all this I hope it plainly appears that there could be no danger from me; and therefore as you cannot surely think of being cruel for cruelty's sake, that you will suffer me to live. 2. Any further punishment upon me, or any other of the unhappy refugees who shall remain in New York, will be altogether unnecessary, for they do suffer and will suffer from the nature of the thing, as much as a merciful man could wish to impose upon his greatest enemy. By this I mean the dreadful mortification (after our past puffing and vaunting) of being tinder the dominion of Congress, seeing and hearing the conduct and discourse of the friends of America, and perhaps being put in mind of our own, in former times. You have probably seen many of the English newspapers, and also some of mine, and you have among you the few prisoners who by a miracle escaped death in our hands. By all these means you may learn, with what infinite contempt, with what provoking insult, and with what unexampled barbarity, your people have, from the beginning to the end been treated by the British officers, excepting a very small number, but above all by the tories and refugees, who not having the faculty of fighting, were obliged to lay out their whole wrath and malice in the article of speaking. I remember, when one of the prisoners, taken after the gallant defence of Fort Washington, had received several kicks for not being in his rank, he said, Is this the way of treating a gentleman? The answer was, G—d d—n your blood, who made you a gentleman? which was heard by us all present with unspeakable satisfaction, and ratified by general applause. I have also seen one of your officers, after long imprisonment, for want of clothes food and lodging, as meagre as a skeleton and as dirty and shabby as a London beggar, when one of our friends would say with infinite humour, Look you, there is one of King Cong's ragged rascals. You must remember the many sweet names given you in print, in England and America, Rebels, Rascals, Raggamuffins, Tatterdemalions, Scoundrels, Blackguards, Cowards, and Poltroons. You cannot be ignorant how many and how complete victories we gained over you, and what a figure you made in our narratives. We never once made you to retreat, seldom even to fly as a routed army, but to run off into the woods, to scamper away through the fields, and to take to your heels as usual. You will probably soon see the gazette account of the defeat of Mr. Washington at Monmouth. There it will appear how you scampered off, and how the English followed you and mowed you down, till their officers, with that humanity which is the characteristic of the nation, put a stop to this carnage, and then by a masterly stroke of generalship, stole a march in the night, lest you should have scampered back again and obliged them to make a new slaughter in the morning. Now, dear gentlemen, consider what a miserable affair it must be for a man to be obliged to apply with humility and self abasement to those whom he hath so treated, nay, even to beg life of them, while his own heart upbraids him with his past conduct, and perhaps his memory is refreshed with the repetition of some of his rhetorical flowers. It is generally said that our friend Burgoyne was treated with abundance of civility by General Gates, and yet I think it could not be very pleasing to him to see and hear the boys, when he entered Albany, going before and crying "Elbow Room for General Burgoyne there." Fear and trembling have already taken hold of many of the refugees and friends of government in this place. It would break your hearts to hear poor Sam S—, of Philadelphia, weeping and wailing, and yet he was a peaceable quaker who did nothing in the world but hire guides to the English parties who were going out to surprise and butcher you. My brother of trade, G—, is so much affected, that some say he has lost, or will soon lose his reason. For my own part, I do not think I run any risk in that respect. All the wisdom that I was ever possessed of is in me still, praised be Grod, and likely to be so. A man that has run the gauntlet of creditors, duns and bailiffs, for years in England, and has been cudgelled, kicked, and p—d upon in America, is in no danger of losing his reason by any circumstance whatever, so long as there is the least prospect of saving his life. I have heard some people say, that dishonor was worse than death, but with the great Sancho Panza, I was always of a different opinion. I hope, therefore, your honors will consider my sufferings as sufficient to atone for my offences, and allow me to continue in peace and quiet, and according to the North British proverb, Sleep in a whole Skin. 3. I beg leave to suggest, that upon being received into favour, I think it would be in my power to serve the United States in several important respects. I believe many of your officers want politeness. They are like old Cincinnatus, taken from the plough; and therefore must still have a little roughness in their manners and deportment. Now, I myself am the pink of courtesy, a genteel, portly, well looking fellow, as you will see in a summer's day. I understand and possess the bienséance, the manner, the grace, so largely insisted on by Lord Chesterfield; and may without vanity say, I could teach it better than his Lordship, who in that article has remarkably failed. I hear with pleasure that your people are pretty good scholars, and have made, particularly, very happy advances in the art of swearing, so essentially necessary to a gentleman, yet I dare say they will themselves confess, that they are still in this respect far inferior to the English army. There is, by all accounts, a coarseness and sameness in their expression; whereas there is variety, sprightliness and figure, in the oaths of gentlemen well educated. Dean Swift says very justly, "A footman may swear, hut he cannot swear like a lord." Now we have many lords in the English army, all of whom when they were here, were pleased to honor me with their friendship and intimacy; so that I hope my qualifications can hardly be disputed. I have imported many of the most necessary articles for appearance in genteel life. I can give them Lavornitti's soap balls to wash their brown hands clean, perfumed gloves, paint, powder, and pomatum. I can also furnish the New-England men with rings, seals, swords, canes, snuff boxes, tweezer cases, and many other such notions, to carry home to their wives and mistresses, who will be nation-glad to see them. You are also to know that I import a great many patent medicines, which may be of use to your army. It is said that some of them are exceedingly liable to a disorder called by physicians the rancomania, which is frequently followed by the two twin diseases of plumbophobia and siderophobia. If they will but submit to a strict regimen, and take the tincture drops and pills which I prepare, I am confident the cure in most cases would be infallible. I have been informed, that a certain person, well known to your august body, has clearly demonstrated that virtue and severity of manners are necessary to those who would pull an old government down, which feat is now happily accomplished; but that luxury, dissipation, and a taste for pleasures, are equally necessary to keep up a government already settled. As I suppose you are fully convinced of this most salutary truth, I take it for granted, now that you have settled governments in all the states, you are looking out for proper persons to soften the rigid virtue of the Americans, and lay them asleep in the lap of self-indulgence. Now, I am proud to say, that there is not a man on this continent more able to serve you in this respect, than myself. I have served many of the British officers in a most honorable station and character, of which the great Pandarus of Troy was the most ancient example. If I am happy enough to make my own conversation and manners the standard of the mode, I believe you will see very powerful effects of it in a short time. But if after recovering your friendship myself, I am able also to bring back and reconcile to his country the Rev. Dr. A—, I believe the system will be perfect. That gentleman, by his robust form, is well fitted to be an ecclesiastical bruiser, if such an officer should be needed; and, with all due deference to the officers of the American army, I should think that a better way of terminating differences among them in the last resort than sword or pistol, for many obvious reasons. He has also distinguished himself by the publication of some poems, on subjects extremely well suited to the character of a christian clergyman, and very proper for initiating the tender mind in the softest and most delicious of all arts, viz. the art of love. Finally, I hope I may be of service to the United States, as a writer, publisher, collector, and maker of news. I mention this with some diffidence; because, perhaps, you will think I have foreclosed myself from such a claim, by confessing (as above) that my credit as a newswriter is broken by overstretching. But it is common enough for a man in business, when his credit is wholly gone in one place, by shifting his ground, and taking a new departure, to flourish away, and make as great or greater figure than before. How long that splendor will last is another matter, and belongs to an after consideration. I might therefore, though my credit is gone in New York, set up again in the place which is honored with your residence. Besides, I might write those things only or chiefly, which you wish to be disbelieved, and thus render you the most essential service. This would be aiming and arriving at the same point, by maneauvering retrograde. Once more, as I have been the ostensible printer of other people's lies in New York, what is to hinder me from keeping incog. and inventing or polishing lies, to be issued from the press of another printer in Philadelphia? In one, or more, or all of these ways, I hope to merit your approbation. It would be endless to mention all my devices; and therefore I will only say further, that I can take a truth, and so puff and swell and adorn it, still keeping the proportion of its parts, but enlarging their dimensions, that you could hardly discover where the falsehood lay, in case of a strict investigation. That I may not weary you, I conclude with recommending myself to your kind countenance and protection; and in the mean time, waiting for a favorable answer, your petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever pray, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX L. [Page 130.] The following is the Address of Andrew Marvel to the Public, introducing The Constitutional Courant. "When a new public paper makes its appearance, the reader will naturally be curious to know from whence it came, the publisher, and the design of it. To gratify that curiosity, know reader, that the publisher having formerly acquired a competent knowledge of the printing business, for his amusement, furnished himself with a set of proper materials; and the authors of the following pieces having acquainted him that they applied to the Printers in New York, who refused to publish them in their newspapers—not because they disapproved them, or were apprehensive of danger, but because several of their friends had been anxious on their account, and particularly desired them to be careful not to publish any thing that might give the enemies of liberty an advantage, which they would be glad to take over them; and as these pieces are thought to be wrote with greater freedom than any thing that has yet appeared in the public prints, they thought proper to shew so much complaisance to the advice of their friends as to desire to be excused, and to return the copies: But I, who am under no fear of disobliging either friends or enemies, was pleased with the opportunity of turning my private amusement to the public good; I not only undertook to publish them, but now inform my countrymen, that I shall occasionally publish any thing else that falls in my way, which appears to me to be calculated to promote the cause of liberty, of virtue, of religion, and my country, of love and reverence to its laws and constitution, and unshaken loyalty to the king—And so I bid you heartily farewell.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX M. [Page 169.] No. 1. of The South Carolina Gazette was introduced to the public by the following Address, which appears to have been written by a correspondent who was a friend to the printer, and who felt interested in the establishment of a newspaper in the colony. "To the Reader. "It being justly expected that what is thus offered to the Public, should be written with a View at least, to their service, it may not be improper, in this prefatory Paper, to let the Reader know, that something conducive to that end, will be attempted in those which are to follow. "It is therefore desired, that such who are willing to assist in this attempt, will communicate to the Printer of this Paper, what may occur to them of that Nature. "And, as the chief thing aimed at, is the Good of this Province in general, it is hoped that this Application to the Public, for such Correspondence, may not be looked upon as impertinent. "We are sensible it by no means becomes those who are requesting their Readers to be their Correspondents, to restrain them to any particular Subjects; yet, we shall venture to point out One, as believing it such that every worthy Inhabitant of the Province will allow to have the first Claim to his Pen. "We mean the Trade of this Colony, which perhaps, not without reason, may be apprehended to be in danger of declining, unless some new methods are considered of, and put in Practice, for encreasing and improving its Produce and Manufactures. "This, were it effected, would tend not only to the Good of the Province in general, and the particular Interest of many indigent Families, but, likewise, be instrumental in answering the Design of his Majesty in taking this Province into his Possession and Protection; which, doubtless, was to advance and extend its Trade, and consequently to see that part of his People who are settled here, in a flourishing and happy State. "Yet, however gracious his Majesty's Intentions are towards us, it must be owned that without some Regard to what has been hinted at in relation to the Produce and Manufactures of this Province, we shall not only be so injurious to ourselves, but also so ungrateful to him, as in a great measure to frustrate those his Intentions. "This, it is hoped, may be some little Incitement to abler pens to assist and promote this Design. "But since it has proved true from Experience, that Papers of this Kind, calculated only for the Use of the more serious Part of Mankind, have been by many thrown aside, who might perhaps have been agreeably led into the perusal of them, had the Dulce been artfully interspersed with the Utile, it may not be amiss to acquaint our Readers, that even those, whose genius reaches no further than Amusement, will be deemed good Correspondents, provided they carefully avoid giving Offence either public or private; and particularly, that they forbear all Controversies both in Church and State; for since the principal Thing in View by publishing these Papers, is the general Service of the People residing in this Province, let us not (however incapable we may prove of accomplishing our Purpose) at once defeat it by that Bane of all Civil Society, Party Division; but rather let us be mindful that our Number is small; our Unity ought, therefore, to be greater, as well for the Advancement of our own Interests, as the Honour and Service of the Prince under whose Government and Protection we have the Happiness to live. "In a word, such may be assured of having their Essays, whether in Prose or Verse, inserted in this Paper every Saturday, who take care that the Purport of them be not too manifestly opposite to the Principles laid down in the following Lines, which we have been lately obliged with by an unknown hand, and cannot think unworthy the Sight of those we could wish to be Correspondents, nor yet disagreeable to the Hint we have borrowed from Horace at the Head of our Paper.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX N. [Page 198.] The long article on Newspapers, in Appleton's New American Cyclopedia, vol. XII, published in 1861, was apparently prepared with considerable labor, and contains a good deal of statistical information. In the portion relating to this country, although the writer has drawn freely from Mr. Thomas's History, there are some differences of statement as well as much additional matter belonging to a later period of time. As authorities are seldom given, there are wanting means of determining the actual or comparative accuracy of the several accounts. The Cyclopedia says: "In Spanish America the first newspaper was founded in Chili in 1812." "In Mexico the oldest newspaper is El Siglio XIX, which is published daily and supports liberal principles." "In the present British American colonies, the credit of establishing the earliest newspaper belongs to the island of Barbados, where Keimer founded the Barbados Gazette, in 1731. Thirty-one years afterwards, in 1762, appeared the Barbados Mercury, which continued till 1845. In the other British West India islands newspapers were introduced as follows: Grenada, 1742; Antigua, 1748; St. Kitts, 1748; Dominica, 1765; St. Vincent, 1784. In July of the latter year the Bermuda Gazette was founded. In Canada the Quebec Gazette appeared in 1765, and the Montreal Gazette in 1775. In Nova Scotia, the Halifax Gazette appeared in 1751, but was not firmly established till 1760. In New Brunswick two or three newspapers were published at St. Johns in 1782." These statements may be compared with those of the present work.—H. MAGAZINES, AND OTHER PERIODICAL WORKS PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1810. MASSACHUSETTS. Anthology, and Boston Review.

I have not been sparing of attention or expense to make this an accurate list; and notwithstanding it may not be perfectly correct, it does not fall far short of being a complete register of the newspapers published between the months of January and July of the year 1810. The papers, in the new settlements particularly, have their titles and places of publication often shifted, and the publishers are frequently changed. Some publications are continued but a short time, and others rise and fill their places. There are some papers published, of which I could not obtain a particular account, and therefore I have not brought them into this estimate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CATALOGUE OF PUBLICATIONS IN WHAT IS NOW THE UNITED STATES, PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION OF 1775–6. 1639. An Almanac for 1639, calculated for New England, by Mr. Wm. Pierce, Mariner. Cambridge. Printed by Stephen Daye. Winthrop's Journal, vol. 1, p. 289. Freeman's Oath. Printed by S. Daye. Cambridge. On the face of a half sheet of small paper. The first thing printed in what is now the United States.—Winthrop's Journal, vol. 1, p. 289. 1640. Almanac for 1640. [No imprint. Cambridge. (Daye).] Mr. Thomas was of opinion that Daye's name never appeared in an imprint. The Whole Booke of Psalms, Faithfully Translated into English Metre. Whereunto is prefixed a discourse declaring not only the lawfullness, but also the necessity of the heavenly Ordinance of singing Scripture Psalmes in the Churches of God. Imprinted 1640. Not paged. 147 leaves 8vo. Rev. Thos. Prince, in his revised edition of 1758, calls this The New England Psalm Book. It was also called The Bay Psalm Book, and later The New England Version of the Psalms. Prince states that the work of translation was committed especially to Richard Mather, Thomas Weld, and John Eliot, and was finished in 1640, and printed that year at Cambridge by Daye, the first book, he supposes, printed in North America. [There were five copies of this rare book in the Prince Library, now a part of the Public Library of Boston. Of these two remain in the library, and of the other three, one is owned by George Brinley, Esq., of Hartford, Conn., one by Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, M.D., of Boston, and one by the widow of the late George Livermore of Cambridge. For collation. etc., See History of Printing, vol. 1, pp. 46–7. Mr. Thomas omitted the name of Richard Mather, as one of the translators, in his quotation from Prince.* * Mr. Thomas's lists of early publications at Cambridge were confessedly incomplete, and, from the necessity of the case, some of his descriptions failed of perfect accuracy; but, as additions and variations often involved questions of authority not always undisputed, it was thought best to leave them, generally, to be made in this catalogue. which can be compared with his text. By History of Printing, in this catalogue, the new edition is always meant. H. See also the catalogue of the Prince Library.] 1641. An Almanac for 1641. Cambridge. [Daye.] A Catechism agreed upon by the Elders at the Desire of the General Court. Cambridge. [Daye.] See Winthrop's Journal, vol. II, p. 37. The Body of Liberties. Fol. Cambridge. [Daye.] It contained 100 Laws drawn up by Rev. Nath'l Ward of Ipswich, pursuant to an order of the General Court. Mr. Ward had a legal education in England. See Hist. of Printing, vol. I, p. 47, n. Mr. Thomas is probably mistaken in supposing that The Body of Liberties, established in 1641, was printed at that time. A pamphlet, entitled An Abstract of the Laws of New England, was printed in London in 1641, and has by many writers been supposed to be substantially the same as the Body of Liberties. There is good reason to believe that the last named compilation was published by distribution to the towns in manuscript. One of these copies, discovered by Mr. Francis C. Gray, and accompanied by his learned essay on the Early Laws of Massachusetts Bay, was printed in the Mass. Hist. Coll., 3d Se., vol. 8. 1642. The Capital Laws of the Massachusetts Bay, with the Freeman's Oath. Ordered to be printed, 18th 3d month, 1642. [Col. Rec.] Mentioned, as printed in Massachusetts, in the Preface to New England's Jonas Cast up at London. Theses, etc., of the first Graduates of Harvard College. Cambridge. [DAYE.] 1645. A Declaration of Former Passages and Proceedings Betwixt the English and the Narragansetts. 4to. [Daye.] [By Gov. Winthrop.] 1646. An Almanac. 12mo. Cambridge, N. E. 1647. An Almanac, by Samuel Danforth. Cambridge. Printed by Matthew Daye; and to be sold by Hezekiah Usher, at Boston. See History of Printing, vol. I, p. 48. The Psalms in Metre, etc. This, according to Mr. Thomas, was a second edition of The Bay Psalm Book or New England Version "somewhat amended, and with a few Spiritual Songs added." After this edition, he says, the Psalms were revised by Pres. Dunster of Harvard College, and Mr. Richard Lyon. The revised version went through numerous editions, not only here but in England and Scotland. It was attached to several English and Scotch editions of the Bible.—See History of Printing, vol. I, p. 47. Mr. Thomas may be mistaken in supposing that this edition was "somewhat amended, and with a few Spiritual Songs added." Mr. Brinley of Hartford, has a copy with the date of 1647 ("Imprinted 1647,") without place, which is a simple reprint, without additions, of the first edition (in a smaller size) with some changes of spelling. The changes of spelling would, perhaps, be more likely to occur if the book was printed in England, which may have been the case, though some experts there think otherwise. The title given by Mr. Thomas, viz: "The Psalms in Metre, faithfully translated for the Use, Edification and Comfort of the Saints, in public and private, especially in New England," is that of the revised edition. Mr. Brinley's copy with the date of 1647, wherever printed, may fairly be regarded as the second edition, and, so far as known, is unique. 1648. An Almanac, by Samuel Danforth. Cambridge. 1649. Almanac for 1649. By Samuel Danforth. Cambridge. Printed by S. Green.

The printing appears to have commenced in 1648. It is referred to in the Mass. Records of May 1648, as "now at the presse." See Mass. Rec., vol. II, pp. 239, 246, 262.

Supposed by Mr. Thomas to have been printed in 1664 or 1665. Hist. of Printing, vol. I, pp. 68–69. The true date of this edition is doubtful. It is also doubtful whether the printing was done in this country or in England. The same types are not seen in any other work executed here. It is possible that Mr. Usher ordered copies printed at Cambridge in England to be bound up with the small Bibles printed there and elsewhere for the New England market. Other copies with the same imprint, varying slightly in size, and with some changes in the spelling of words in the text are met with. Mr. Brinley of Hartford has one. Mr. Thomas's copy was bound with a Bible printed at Cambridge, England, by Roger Daniel, 1648. The Psalms are similarly associated with Bibles printed in other places, and of other dates. They are all of the version revised and improved by Dunster and Lyon. See Hist. of Printing, vol. I, p. 47. The date of the Psalms cannot be decided by the date of the Bibles. Mr. Lenox thinks this may be the 5th edition, and the first that was printed in two columns. 1666. Almanac for 1666. By Josiah Flint. Cambridge. Printed by S. Green. Eliot, John.
