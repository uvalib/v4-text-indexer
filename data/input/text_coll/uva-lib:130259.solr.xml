Economics Alfred Lewis Stevens Commerce and Business Administration GENERAL STATEMENT The University of Virginia was one of the first institutions in the United States to introduce the subject of Economics into its curriculum. From the opening of its doors in 1825, courses in this subject have been taught continuously to the present time. It was not, however, until 1906 that the School of Economics was established as a separate unit in the College. Prior to this year it had existed, first, as a part of the School of Moral Philosophy and later was connected with the School of History. The demand for additional courses in this fieldâespecially those which would train more definitely for a business careerâwas recognized soon after 1910, but owing to a lack of resources it was not possible to expand the work immediately. By 1915, however, courses in Business Law and Economic Geography had been added to the curriculum, and in response to the insistent demand which had arisen by 1918, new courses were established in the subjects of Accounting, Statistics, Money and Banking, International Trade, Business Organization and Corporation Finance. Several other courses were offered a year later. EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS EXECUTIVE In 1920 the School of Commerce and Business Administration was organized as a separate School of the College. In the spring of 1921 a loyal and public-spirited alumnus, Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, gave the University the sum of $200,000 as a permanent endowment for the School and the title was then changed to the McIntire School of Commerce. In announcing Mr. McIntire's gift, President Alderman stated that, "In this new department he seeks to care in a high way for training in the great field which develops trade and commerce and material prosperity. The South has furnished more than its share of soldiers, statesmen, and lawyers. It is his belief and mine that we must now prepare to train great business men for the important services of trade and commerce." As the result of Mr. McIntire's gift the new School was then placed on a permanent basis and a well-defined course of study, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce, was established. It was the aim of the Faculty in working out the requirements for the degree to combine as effectively as possible both cultural and professional subjects. The purpose is to render available to the business executive an education which is liberal as well as professional in nature. SCHOOLS IN THE COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS During the first and second years the curriculum consists mainly of courses that are required for the cultural Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, while in the third and fourth years it is made up very largely of courses in Economics and Commerce. The plan differs at certain points from that of many universities which super-impose a professional business course during the junior and senior years on a two-year course in the liberal arts college. The regular session of the University is organized on a three-term basis and all of the courses in commerce continue for the full session. Although the James Wilson School of Economics and the McIntire School of Commerce are organized as separate Schools in the College, there is the closest co-operation between the members of the Faculty of the two Schools. There is also correlation between the Schools in the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce and accredited courses. The need for a specialized degree in commerce was clearly shown by the response which immediately followed the establishment of the McIntire School, and by the substantial growth which has since continued. During the present session there are approximately 150 students, who are definitely enrolled in the School, while several times as many are given instruction in the various classes. An outstanding achievement in the session of 1924-25 was the admission of the School to membership in the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business. There are 40 colleges and universities represented in the Association. AIMS AND PURPOSES The School aims to give thorough training in the fundamental principles underlying business. While this necessitates a knowledge of facts and methods, it is not the primary purpose to concentrate on those details of business which are necessarily mastered after a man enters a given field of business and are more readily grasped as a result of such training. The definite object is to prepare the student for those lines of business activity requiring the exercise of intelligence and an appreciation of economic forcesâin other words, to train the student in the kind of work which will fit him for positions of responsibility. While the successful executive must usually serve an apprenticeship of several years, during which he gains an intimate knowledge of the details and technical requirements of business administration, his course of promotion is more rapid and better assured if he has first grasped some of the scientific principles which apply in all business procedure. It is now recognized that a college trained man, who has made a rigorous study of the controlling factors in the organization of commerce and business, has a great advantage over the man who must obtain this knowledge over a long period by a process of trial and error. It is the aim also to foster the development of the professional point of view and a high standard of business conduct. In keeping with the ideals of other Schools and Departments of the University, the student will be given every encouragement to achieve a high position in business leadership and public service. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see for the College of Arts and Science, the Bulletin of that Department. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE For admission by certificate from a secondary school the applicant should file with the Dean of the University, not later than September 1, a certificate of preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, must submit a formal application for admission, on a blank form supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. An applicant for admission from a secondary school which requires a special grade for recommendation to college must have made the grade required by his school or must have ranked in the upper three-quarters of his class. In every case an applicant must have the general recommendation of the principal of his school. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificate credit for any entrance unit is invalidated by subsequent failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here. PUBLIC SERVICE The rapid growth in the functions and forms of activity of all branches of government service has made it highly important that those who wish to enter this field should receive special training. The University is especially desirous of providing such training and ample facilities are offered in the study of our federal system of government, and the spheres of authority exercised by the state and local units. Opportunities are afforded for the study of foreign and diplomatic service, and a wide range of courses may be selected in the customs, languages and literature of foreign countries. Likewise provision is made as fully as possible by which the student may gain familiarity with the various federal bureaus and agencies at Washington. Free use is made of governmental documents, attention being given not only to the contents of these but also to the forms and methods of preparation. The significance of the statistical data presented in the various reports of such agencies as the Census Bureau, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Interstate Commerce Commission, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc., is also shown. A similar study is made of the State documents of Virginia and of other States. FIELD WORK It is the purpose of the School to supplement the classroom instruction with field work whenever this is feasible. Students will be assigned problems which require first-hand investigation in the business houses of Charlottesville. In this way concrete information may be obtained in such courses as Accounting, Business Organization, Marketing, Banking, Public Finance, Labor Problems, etc. LIBRARY EQUIPMENT The University Libraries on January 1, 1929, contained 158,557 volumes, of which 93,792 were at the Rotunda or General Library, and the remainder in various departmental libraries or collections. The Rotunda collection contains the standard works in history, literature and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of the causes, the conduct, and the results of the world war, and of general political, social and economic achievements and tendencies. The reference section is well supplied with journals, encyclopedias and research documents. It has been the effort of the School of Commerce primarily to secure the standard publications in all lines of economic and commercial activity. Additions are constantly being made to the library equipment of such books as have received recognition from authorities in the various fields of commerce and business. While the University aims to maintain a fairly complete selection of books in this field, more care is given to the selection than to the number of publications secured. The library subscribes to the leading American publications on commerce and finance and to some of the principal English journals. The periodicals are regularly used for reference purposes, and students are urged to keep in constant touch with current business news and problems. The library also contains complete sets of the more important magazines in the field of economic theory which are of especial use to those who wish to engage in research. POSITIONS FOR GRADUATES The School of Commerce has been quite successful in securing positions for its graduates. Through the members of its Faculty it has been able to maintain a connection with business firms, banking institutions, and government bureaus, which has enabled it to obtain employment for students who have made a good record in the School. Graduates of the University who have received extensive training in the School of Economics and School of Commerce have experienced little difficulty in finding satisfactory positions. EXPENSES Students in the School of Commerce are subject only to the regular fees of the academic departments. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student (all University fees, board and room, books and laundry) need not exceed $400 for the session. The actual expenses are usually greater than this, but are largely within the control of the student himself. One who is willing to practice strict economy can live at a more reasonable cost at the University of Virginia than at most institutions of similar rank. Free tuition in the academic departments, equivalent to a scholarship worth $175, is given to each student from Virginia. There are also available for deserving students many scholarships, including over 100 which yield from $250 to $600 a year. Moreover, there are 119 scholarships for prospective Virginia teachers, numerous endowed fellowships, and several loan funds. Two teaching fellowships of $500 each are available for graduate students in the James Wilson School of Economics, and new additional fellowships of even greater value will be available for 1929-30 and later sessions, some of which will be allocated to graduate students in Economics and Commerce of requisite experience and promise. Rooms may be had in one of the University dormitories and meals may be obtained either in the University cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house. If preferred both room and board may be obtained in such boarding house. Good, wholesome food is served at the University cafeteria at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. STUDENT SELF-HELP Many opportunities for self-help are offered by the University and by the city of Charlottesville. At least half of the students at the present time are paying their own way in whole or in part. Answers to a recent questionnaire submitted to the students of the University showed that approximately 54 per cent. of the entire student body are paying a part or all of their expenses, not including the holders of scholarships or those borrowing money. It was found that more than seventy different occupations are engaged in by those working their way through the University. The Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., assisted by a committee of the faculty, is always ready to help find part-time positions for those who must work while they study. Every possible opportunity for obtaining remunerative employment is afforded to students who are desirous of helping by this means to pay their way through the University, and it may be safely stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session, can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will pay a considerable part of his living expenses and University charges for the remainder of the academic year. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. THE HONOR SYSTEM For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatsoever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the University authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.

In the first and second years the program is uniform for all students as given above. Program for Third and Fourth Years ACCOUNTANCY The modern business corporation with its extended and widespread activities demands the services of trained accountants. This demand has been furthered and tremendously increased in recent years as a result of the Federal Income Tax Laws. Accountancy has, in fact, developed into a profession. The courses offered here give a student instruction in the fundamental principles of the subject, whereas the more advanced courses prepare him for professional practice in accountancy, and lead up to the State examinations for the certified public accountant certificate. The elementary course is required of all applicants for a B.S. in Commerce degree.

The tendency is toward the corporate form. Regardless of the form there is the necessity of financing the business and no manager can hope to succeed without a knowledge of the problems involved in this division of his responsibility. This course is designed to train the student in the various methods of financing a business and to familiarize him with the profession and functions of the investment banker through whom modern industry is increasingly financed. The course also undertakes to familiarize the student with the essentials of sound investment. It is assumed that there is no better way to achieve this result than from the analysis of the life history of the corporation.

The financial system is the very heart of the present economic order and the business executive in any field must have a sufficient knowledge of banking to insure proper relations between his business and the banker. The course is designed to provide a cultural knowledge of financial organization, to show the interdependence of banking and business and to afford an adequate foundation for a career in the banking profession.

The course in commerce embraces a study of the principal forms of organization and their legal status. Special attention is given to the growth of corporations and combinations, to the study of the relative economic efficiency of small- and large-scale production in various forms of business. The development of large marketing organizations in recent times is also treated as a phase of the general movement toward larger business units and wider co-operation in business. In the courses in business organization one of the chief aims is to set forth in their true relationships the fundamental principles of management which are generally applicable in organized business today. Much stress is laid on such factors as the promotion of initiative, incentive to effort, delegation of authority, placement of responsibility and means of co-ordination in various forms of business organization. The subject of "scientific management" is given considerable emphasis.

As a result the distributive processes became relatively inefficient and today there is a growing demand for more efficient methods of marketing and merchandising. The course is designed to permit of a view of the distributive system as a whole as well as the various methods of marketing and the problems which each method involves. The work is so planned that the student will also gain a sound grasp of the essentials of modern merchandising. The far-reaching changes now taking place in distribution are such as to cause much concern to men in every field of business and the course is designed to serve the needs of those who plan to enter some phase of distribution as well as those who propose to engage in related fields.

Until recently statistical facts were not subjected to scientific treatment, but were generally dealt with in a rule-of-thumb manner or on a purely quantitative basis. The time has passed, however, when economists and business men can be content with a mere compilation of facts or haphazard methods in their use. Hence, the subject of statistics is recognized as a highly technical and complex division of economic science. The courses in statistics are designed to acquaint the student with sources of statistical data and with approved methods of gathering and classifying the facts to be used. Particular attention is given to legitimate processes for analysis and comparison of the data obtainedâincluding a study of averages, index numbers, correlation, etc. An endeavor is made to develop initiative and resourcefulness on the part of the student. The general course in statistics (Economics B5) is required of all applicants for the B.S. in Commerce degree.

The intelligent management of workers is so important a part of the administration of a business that it properly forms a subject by itself. A satisfactory labor policy is now coming to be regarded as the most vital element in business management. For the student interested in the labor side of business administration there are several courses suggested below which will give him a broad background for dealing with any problems of this nature which may come up in his future business career. An advanced course in labor problems is given for the student wishing to do more advanced work in this field. An intensive study is made of the labor difficulties arising out of economic activities connected with the production, exchange, and distribution of wealth. This course aims to acquaint the student with the many problems arising out of the relations of employer and employee; the philosophy, policies, and methods of organized labor; unemployment; agencies for the promotion of industrial peace, scientific management, etc. Third Year: Session-hours Commercial Law B1 3 Economics B2 3 Economics B3 3 Economics B5 3 Government B1 3 15 Fourth Year: Economics B8 or C10 3 Economics B9 3 * * See general catalogue of the University. Sociology B1 3 History B2 or B3 3 Economics C6 3 15 TRANSPORTATION The subject of transportation under modern conditions is very complex. The principles governing railroad transportation are in many respects different from those governing water transportation, and those governing motor transportation different from either. The subject of ocean shipping, including freight rates and handling facilities, is taken up in connection with Foreign Trade. On account of its great importance the study of railroad transportation is receiving increasing attention from students in commerce and business. The work in this subject covers the economic principles of railroad transportation, the location of systems, operating revenues and expenditures, railway finance, accounting, reorganizations and receiverships. Attention is directed to the organization of the freight and passenger services, the general forms of corporate organization and the relationship of the railroad to the general public. Special emphasis is placed upon the character and development of rate-making agencies and systems, and the relationship between railroad rates and industrial growth. Recent developments in motor vehicle and aeroplane transportation are also studied in their relation to other forms of transportation.

The economic resources and development of the principal trading countries of the world are studied, particular attention being given to their relationship to American Commerce. In the treatment of ocean navigation and trade routes, special emphasis is placed upon the underlying principles governing the movement of commodities. The principal purpose of the courses suggested below is to give a broad economic training for those young men who are pursuing the academic part of their preparation for business. An advanced course in foreign trade is also given, which deals with the forms and methods of commerce, business practices abroad, foreign tariffs, sales methods, and foreign exchange. This course is given not only for those students who expect to make a special vocation of exporting or importing, but also for the future business men who will have occasional contact with problems in foreign marketing in the conduct of domestic businesses. Special emphasis is placed upon the theory of foreign trade and its practical application to governmental and broad business policies.

True insurance is a means by which the risks of economic loss are transferred from the individual to a group or association. In many fields to which it is applied, it is possible by scientific calculation to determine average losses to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Thus, today insurance itself has become one of the largest of all forms of business. The course is designed mainly to lay a broad foundation for the student in the principles and practice of insurance. Consideration is given to its development, its forms and uses, types of insurance organizations, and its general function in relation both to business and the State.
