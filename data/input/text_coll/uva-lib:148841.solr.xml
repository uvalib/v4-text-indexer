      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS, &amp;c. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; provided, that if under the age of twenty-one, he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shown allow him to attend less than three. The qualifications of the student to enter the schools of Ancient Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy, are tested by previous examinations. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. In each school, there are three regular lectures a week; besides which, there are in most of them extra lectures suited to the several classes into which the school is divided. The mode of instruction is by text-books and lectures, accompanied by rigid examinations. The course pursued in each school, is as follows: I. ANCIENT LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison.âIn this School are taught the Latin and Greek languages; the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature; and the Hebrew language. The instruction is given partly by lectures and examinations, and partly by comments on portions of the text-books appointed to be read by the student. It embraces the following subjects, distributed according to the classes. I. Junior Latin.â1. General principles and doctrines of the Etymology. 2. The application of these general principles in the explanation of the formation and composition of the words of the language, considered individually, and without regard to their relations to other words in a sentence. The doctrine of the primary and secondary significations of words is considered in connection with this branch of the subject, and is illustrated in the lectures from day to day as occasion may offer. 3. The accidence, or inflectional forms of words, expressing the relations in which they stand to other words in a sentence. These modifications of the forms of words are in like manner explained by the application of the general principles of the etymology. 4. The Syntax, or laws which govern the relations existing between the several parts of a sentence or a discourse, whether indicated by the inflections of words, or by particles. This subject is treated of partly in lectures specially devoted to it, partly by way of prelections and comment on the portions of authors read in the lecture room, and partly in connection with the written exercises. For the above subjects the text books are the professor's printed notes, and Zumpt's Latin Grammar. 5. The doctrine of the quantity of syllables, and the metres. The students are advised to use Carey's Latin Prosody, or Anthon's Prosody, which contains what is most useful in Carey's. 6. The Latin authors used as text books are Horace, Virgil, Cicero's Orations, and his Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries. The last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. II. Senior Latin.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the classic authors, embracing, besides the other matters necessary for the better understanding of these, a further development of the doctrines of philology taught in the Junior Class. The text books are Horace, Juvenal, Livy, and Tacitus. 2. Geography of Ancient Italy.âThe professor's printed notes form the text book. The maps of ancient and modern Italy, published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," are recommended. 3. Roman History. This subject is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text books. These are the History of Rome published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," Niebuhr's History of Rome, Ferguson's Roman Republic, and Heeren's Manual. III. Junior Greek.â1. The Etymology, considered in its general principles and in its applications, the Syntax, and the Prosody and metres, are taught to this class in the same way as to the Junior Latin. For these subjects Buttmann's larger Greek Grammar is the text book. Thiersch's Tables of the Greek verb, by Patton, are referred to and recommended. The Greek authors read and explained in the lecture room, are Xenophon's Anabasis, Herodotus, and a play of Ãschylus or Euripides. The Greek and English Lexicon of Donnegan is that preferred. IV. Senior Greek.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the Greek classic authors, in the same way as in the Senior Latin class, and embracing the like subjects. The Greek authors used as text books in this class are Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. The student should have Matthiae's Greek Grammar, 5th edition of the translation. 2. Ancient Geography of Greece. The printed notes of the professor form the text. 3. Ancient History of Greece. It is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text books. These are Thirlwall's History of Greece, Gillies' History of Greece, and Heeren's Manual. It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek, that they shall read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture room: e. g.: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected,) and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus: Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises; which consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked: they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises the classic authors are used as the text. V. Hebrew.âThe text books are Biblia Hebraica, Stuart's Hebrew Grammar, 3rd edition, and Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebr. et Chald., or Sauerwein's edition of Rehkopf's Lex. Hebr. Chald. II. MODERN LANGUAGES. Professor BlÃ¦ttermann.âThe languages taught in this school, are the French, Spanish, Italian, German and Anglo Saxon; and if desired, will also be taught the Danish, Swedish, Hollandish and Portuguese languages. In each of them, there are two classes, the senior and junior, together with a third class for those who wish to qualify themselves for degrees in this school, as it is required that two degrees be obtained in modern languages before that of A. M. will be conferred. Besides the oral translations in the lecture room, the students are required to write, as regular exercises out of the lecture rooms, translations from the foreign language into English, and vice versa. Lectures on the Literature of each of the nations whose languages are taught, are delivered twice a week, by the Professor; as also lectures on Modern History, and the political relations of the different civilized nations of the present day. The text books used are the principal classics in each language. III. MATHEMATICS. Professor Bonnycastle.âIn this school there are commonly five classes. Of these the first junior begins with Arithmetic; but as the student is required to have some knowledge of this subject when he enters the University, the lectures of the Professor are limited to the theory, shewing the method of naming numbers, the different scales of notation, and the derivation of the several rules of Arithmetic from the primary notion of addition; the addition namely, of sensible objects one by one. The ideas thus acquired are appealed to at every subsequent step, and much pains are taken to exhibit the gradual developement from these elementary truths of the extensive science of mathematical analysis. Lacroix's Arithmetic is the text book. In Algebra, the first problems are analized, with and without the use of letters, to make the student sensible of the advantages of these signs. In teaching the rules for adding, subtracting, &amp;c., they are compared with the corresponding rules in Arithmetic, and the agreement or diversity is noticed and explained. The text book is Lacroix's Algebra. In Geometry, the first elements are taught, and illustrated by the use of models. The second junior class continue to read Lacroix's Algebra, and Bonnycastle's Inductive Geometry. In the latter, they successively acquireâthe theorems of Synthetic Geometryâthe theory and practice of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the latter to Nautical Astronomyâthe theory of Projectionâand the theory of curved lines and Surfaces. Their subsequent studies usually embrace a portion of the Differential Calculus. The senior classes continue the Differential Calculus in lessons taken from Young and from Bonnycastle's Geometry, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus, the theory of which is taken from Young, and the examples from Peacock. There is, moreover, a class of Mixed Mathematics, for such of the more advanced students as choose to pursue it; which consists of parts of Poisson's Mechanics, the first book of Laplace's Mechanique Celeste, and of the applications of the principles there given to various problems. IV. NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Rogers.âThere are two classes in this school, viz:âThe general or Junior, and the Senior class. In the former, the illustrations are experimental and graphical, with occasional references to the elementary truths of Geometry and Algebra. In the latter mathematical demonstration is almost exclusively employed, sometimes involving the use of the calculus. The various subjects embraced in this school are treated of in the following order, viz: Mechanics, including Statics, Dynamics, Laws of Impulse and Pressure, and Corpuscular Forces, Strength of Materials, Friction and Machinery; Hydrodynamics, including Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Capillary Attraction, &amp;c.â Pneumatics; Acoustics; Heat, including Meteorology and the Steam Engine; Electricity and Galvanism; Magnetism; Electro-Magnetism; Optics; Astronomy. The text books referred to in the Junior Class, are Lardner's Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Pneumatics; Brewster's Optics, by Bache; Herschell's Astronomy; Lardner on the Steam Engine, and the Treatises in the Library of Useful Knowledge on Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydraulics, Pneumatics, Heat, Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism, and Electro-Magnetism. The text books in the senior class are the Cambridge Mechanics, Young's Analytical Mechanics, Gummere's Astronomy, Bache's Appendix to Brewster's Optics. In the senior class the students are examined upon the subjects of lecture in the general class, as well as the Mathematical demonstrations referred to in their text books. The Apparatus provided for the school of Natural Philosophy is extensive and complete, and enables the Professor to illustrate every part of his course by experiments in the presence of his class. An Observatory, with its appropriate astronomical instruments, is attached to this school. V. CIVIL ENGINEERING. This school comprises the following branches of instruction, viz: I.âGraphical Mathematics, embracing Descriptive Geometry, Perspective Mensuration, &amp;c. II.âTheory of Levelling and Surveying, both ordinary and topographical. III.âTheory of Roads, Rail-roads, Canals, Bridges, &amp;c. IV.âTheoretical Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics, as connected with Engineering. V.âLaws of Heat and SteamâTheory and construction of the Steam Engine. VI.âGeology and Mineralogy. VII.âLevelling, Surveying, &amp;c., taught practically in the field. VIII.âPlan drawing, Plotting, Topographical drawing and sketching. The subjects named under the six first heads are divided between the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Those included under the 7th and 8th heads, are taught by the Teacher of Drawing, under the superintendence of the Professors above mentioned. VI. CHEMISTRY. Professor Emmet.âIn the Chemical class of this School, all the important applications of the science to the mechanic arts, agriculture and domestic economy are noticed, and when practicable, illustrated by experiment. In the lectures on earths and metals, the appropriate minerals are exhibited and noticed with reference to sciences of Mineralogy and Geology. At the close of the history of inorganic matter, the atomatic theory, and the laws of definite proportions are fully explained and exemplified. The latter part of the course is occupied with the chemistry of organic substances; and it comprises the history, analysis and properties of each substance; to which are added general views of the connexion between Chemistry and the physiology of animals and vegetables. There is attached to this school, a very extensive apparatus and laboratory. VII. MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Tucker.âThere are two classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres and Logic, the first half of the session, and Belles-Lettres and Ethics, the last half. The Senior studies Mental Philosophy, the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, and Adam Smith. In the Junior Class, the examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers, and Whately's Logic. The students in this school are also exercised in composition. VIII. LAW. Professor Davis.âThis school is arranged into two classes. The subjects studied by the Junior class are the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, and the elementary principles of Municipal Law. The text books used by this class, are Vattel's Law of Nations, the Federalist, the Virginia Report of '99, Blackstone's Commentaries, and a Treatise on Criminal Law by the Professor; in addition to which, lectures are delivered on Government, and various topics of National and Constitutional Law, not discussed in the text-books. The subjects studied by the Senior class, are the Common and Statute Law, Equity and Maritime and Commercial Law. And the text-books used by this class, are Coke upon Littleton, (Thomas's edition,) Stephen on Pleading, Starkie on Evidence, (the first vol.) Matthews on Executors, Chitty on Contracts, Smith's Mercantile Law, Story's Equity, and Mitford's Pleadings. The design of this arrangement is to embrace in the junior course, those studies which not only form an essential part of a liberal professional education, but which from their universal interest and importance, constitute a highly useful branch of general education: whilst the senior course is exclusively occupied with the study of the theory and practice of Law, as a profession. Students can attend either or both the classes; and those not wishing to study Municipal Law at all, can enter for that portion of the junior course which includes National Law, Government and Constitutional Law, which portion, those wishing to study Municipal Law only, can, if they choose, omit. On the text books of both classes, prelections are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and to offer such comments as he deems necessary to the thorough understanding of the subject under consideration. In the prelections on Municipal Law, he refers to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic treated by the author, and particularly explains, in its appropriate connection, the Statute Law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law. Each prelection is preceded by an examination on the last, together with its text. On the lectures delivered, the class are also examined. To assist them in their regular studies, and to accustom them to legal investigations and forensic discussions, the students of this school have instituted a Law Society, at the meetings of which the Professor presides. In it, questions connected with the studies of the school are discussed, fictitious cases litigated in the form of regular pleadings, and the issue produced decided in the appropriate mode, and the members exercised in conveyancing, &amp;c. 3 The students of Law, in common with the students of the other schools, have the use of the extensive Library of the institution; the Law department of which is large and valuable. EXAMINATIONS. There are two public examinations of all the students each session, the one at such convenient time about the middle of the session, as the Faculty shall appoint; the other at the close of the session. These are thus conducted: The Professor of the School prepares, in writing, a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer them in writing, in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method. The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths, and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of the school and two other Professors. The standing of each student at the examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian; and the names of those who are in the first division are announced on the public day, at the close of the session, and published in one or more of the newspapers of the state. DEGREES. Three honorary distinctions are conferred in this Institution; a Certificate of Proficiencyâthat of Graduate in any Schoolâand that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The first, the Faculty may confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of a competent acquaintance with any of those particular branches which according to the regulations, may be separately attended in a school. The second, they are authorised to confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in the general studies of any of the schools. And the third, is obtained by graduation, in the schools of Ancient Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Moral Philosophy, and in any two of the Modern Languages. But in all cases, to obtain a diploma or certificate of proficiency, the candidate must give the Faculty satisfactory proof of his ability to write the English language correctly. No particular period of study is prescribed for the acquisition of these honors. The student obtains them whenever he can undergo the rigid examinations to which the candidates for them are subjected. The title of Doctor of Medicine is conferred on graduates in the Medical department. On the last day of the session, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers, and Students, assemble in the Rotunda, and the public are invited to attend. On this occasion, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, and the results of the examinations are announced. EXPENSES, &amp;c. The expenses for the session of upwards of ten months, (commencing the 1st of September, and ending the 4th of July following,) are as follows: Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance, 125 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor, at cost, and 5 per cent. commission, estimated, if only one Student in the dormitory, at $30, if two students in the dormitory, at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two students, 8 Use of the library and public rooms, 15 Feesâif one Professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25âsay, 75 Total, exclusive of books and stationary, clothing and pocket money, $238 In addition to the regular fee, $20 is paid by students who attend the Senior Class in the School of Law. The fee for attending the class of Materia Medica in the School of Chemistry; of Medical Jurisprudence in the School of Medicine; and of National Law, Government and Constitutional Law, in the School of Law; by those who do not attend those schools, is $15 each. Boarding-houses are provided within the precincts for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except, that students above the age of twenty years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. Every student resident within the precincts, is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate, till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, (two per cent.) to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, and twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purposes aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows: for board, the use of dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated; for clothing during the session, not exceeding a hundred dollars; for pocket money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty dollars; for books or stationary, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow; for medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These limits are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances, the Faculty shall allow it. Resident students are forbidden to contract any debts whatsoever; but for every thing purchased, they are forthwith to pay, or to draw upon a fund in the hands of the Patron applicable thereto. Students wherever resident, are required to wear the uniform prescribed by the enactments; consisting of cloth of dark gray mixture, at a price not exceeding six dollars a yard. The Faculty at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from the lectures he was bound to attend, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty that month; together with such information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. Religious exercises are performed at the University every Sunday, by a Minister of the Gospel, residing there, whose services are rendered on the private invitation of the Professors, Officers and Students.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. CHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Emmet.âThis School is divided into two classes; one of Chemistry, the other of Materia Medica and Pharmacy. In the lectures on Chemistry, which are delivered twice a week throughout the session, all the important applications of the science to Pharmacy and Medicine are noticed and amply illustrated. In treating of the various Salts, Acids, &amp;c., their characters, properties and adulterations, are considered both as Chemical and Medicinal agents. The first part of the course is devoted to the consideration of inorganic substances, and the laws of chemical combination; the subsequent lectures are appropriated to organic bodies, comprising the history, analysis and properties of animal and vegetable substances, with peculiar reference to the active principles most usually employed in Medicine. In the lectures on Materia Medica and Pharmacy, which are delivered once a week throughout the session, the subjects are treated on in the following order: Pharmaceutical processes; preparations, both officinal and extemporaneous; combination as altering and influencing the medicinal qualities of substances; classification; lastly, the physical characters, history and therapeutic properties of the individual articles. In the chemical course, the fullest illustrations by means of experiments, diagrams, &amp;c. are invariably employed; and in that on Materia Medica and Pharmacy, specimens of medicinal substances in their simple state, as well as the officinal preparations of which they form the basis, are constantly laid before the class. To aid still more, drawings and plates of the plants furnishing the principal articles of the vegetable Materia Medica, and when practicable, recent and dried specimens of the plants themselves will be exhibited. Books recommendedâTurner's Chemistry, Wood and Bache's United States Dispensatory, Paris' Pharmacologia. MEDICINE. Professor Griffith.âThis School is also composed of two classes; one of the Theory and Practice of Medicine and Obstetrics, to which three lectures a week are given throughout the session; the other of Medical Jurisprudence, to which three lectures a week are given during two months. The course on the Theory and Practice of Medicine, is commenced with an exposition of the principles of Pathology and Therapeutics, after which the functional and organic lesions of the various tissues and organs are successively considered, and their sympathetic relations and influences carefully explainedâ after which the subject of fevers is treated on in much detail. By the adoption of this plan, the student becomes familiar with the local and general phenomena attendant on particular lesions, before he is called upon to investigate the nature, and treatment of the complicated groups of symptoms, included in febrile diseases. The lectures on Obstetrics comprehend an account of natural and other labours, and the professional assistance to be afforded in each; the treatment of the female before and after delivery, and the diseases of infancy. These lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates, and the application of instruments is exemplified on the mannikin. The lectures on Medical Jurisprudence are delivered three times a week during two months, and include a full consideration of the various topics on which medicine is called upon to aid in the administration of the laws and the detection of crime. Text-books recommended: (Medicine, &amp;c.) Andral's Pathological Anatomy; Hall on Diagnosis; Mackintosh's Practice of Medicine; Stokes's Lectures. (Obstetrics,) Dewee's, Gooch's or Meig's Midwifery. (Medical Jurisprudence,) Beck or Ryan. ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Professor Cabell.âThe course of lectures on Anatomy and Physiology extending from 1st September to the 1st March, will comprise a description of the situation, form, volume, relation, structure, intimate texture, vital properties and functions of the various organs of the human body in health, and of their alterations produced by disease. The following order will be pursued: Differences of organic and inorganic bodies. General consideration of the elements of the human organization and of the tissues which result from their varied combinations. Classification of the tissues and organs. Organic properties and forces. Enumeration and classification of the functions. General laws of abnormal formationsâclassification. Anatomy and Physiology of the Cellular tissue and its varieties. Anatomy and Physiology of the Osseous system in general, and the individual bones, &amp;c. Anatomy and Physiology MusclesâSplanchnic Viscera, and the associated organsâArteries, Veins, and LymphaticsâNervous System, Skin and organs of the Senses. In the description of the distribution of the vascular system, all the other organs will come under review as so many elements in a region having important relations to each other and to the principal element, the vessels, around which they are grouped. In this manner will be shewn not only their mutual connexion, but their several and combined influence upon the developement, progress and treatment of disease. Artificial skeletons and separated bones are used in the demonstration of the Osseous system, and for the other organs of the body careful dissections will be made on fresh subjects with which the school is now abundantly supplied. These demonstrations are further improved by the use of delicate wax, and dried arterial and venous preparations, and of the splendid coloured plates of Bourgery and Jacob, executed from new and careful dissections by a distinguished Anatomist of Paris. The different surgical operations will be performed upon the fresh subject, embracing the general operations, as incisions, sutures, application of ligatures, extirpation of tumours, amputations, &amp;c.âand those which are peculiar to the different regions of the body, a capite ad calcem. The course on the principles of Surgery will commence about the 1st March, and will embrace a full description of the pathology, history, symptoms and treatment of all those affections which are generally assigned to this branch of practical medicine. After a cursory examination of the distinction between Surgery and Medicine, and of some of the most generally received classifications of surgical diseases, the Professor will treat of those diseases and accidents which may occur in any part of the body, and then of those which are peculiar to certain regions. In the description of the diseases not immediately resulting from external violence, it will be his aim to elucidate as far as they are known the morbid changes which precede their full development; the sympathetic affections of other organs: the value of the different physical and rational signs in determining a differential diagnosis between this and other diseases with which it may be confounded, and the general principles which should regulate the practitioner in the application of his therapeutical agents. Books recommended:âMeckle's General Physiological and Pathological Anatomy. Andral's Pathological Anatomy. Vilpean's Surgical Anatomy. S. Cooper's first lines of Surgery. S. Cooper's Surgical Dictionary. Dunglison's Human Physiology. The organization of the medical department of the University of Virginia presents peculiarities not to be found in other Medical Schools in the U. S., and which the experience of many years has shown to be admirably calculated to fulfil the intention of its founders. It would be needless to detail the circumstances by which the University has been enabled to secure to Virginia and the South generally, all the benefits of a school so advantageously organized, but it is deemed right, after so many years of successful operation, that the public should be made acquainted with the great points in which it differs from other medical institutions. Before noticing these it may be stated that medical students are subjected to all the general regulations and penalties for infractions of the laws governing the other schools. Every candidate for graduation is required to undergo a written examination upon English, before a committee appointed by the Chairman of the Faculty. Any person, however, of proper age and of approved moral conduct, may offer as a candidate for graduation, and receive the degree of M. D., without reference to the time of joining the school, provided he undergoes in a satisfactory manner the various examinations prescribed by the enactments. At each meeting of the several classes, the students are subjected to a full examination on the preceding lecture, thus enabling the professor to ascertain their acquaintance with the subject and to explain such of those points as may have been misunderstood. Besides these daily examinations and those immediately necessary for graduation, two public examinations of each class, are held each session, to ascertain the relative standing of each student. These examinations are conducted in writing before a committee, and the degree of merit of each individual reported to his parent or guardian. The names of those who have especially distinguished themselves being also published in one or more of the papers of the state. The examinations for graduation take place at different periods of the session. This arrangement permits the student to prepare himself thoroughly on each of the branches without the confusion of thought and fatigue of mind incident to the method adopted in other medical institutions. The separate examinations are onâPractice of Medicine; Obstetrics; Medical Jurisprudence; Anatomy and Physiology; Surgery; Chemistry and Materia Medica, including Pharmacy. The time thus occupied for each candidate is between three and four hours, when the answers are satisfactory. A period six fold as long as that usually appropriated to this purpose in other medical schools. By this system it must be evident that the professors are always aware of the advance or deficiencies of students, and also that a diploma is never granted to any one not fully qualified to receive the honours of the doctorate. The session continues for ten months without interruption, and but two lectures, each an hour and a half long, are delivered on the same day. The instruction is thus gradually imparted to and profitably retained by the student; nor can he ever experience the perplexity and fatigue of daily encountering six or seven lectures, delivered in rapid succession, as always happens elsewhere in consequence of the necessity of compressing all the lectures within the space of three or four months. Connected with the Medical School, is an Anatomical and Pathological Museum, which has lately been enriched with important and rare specimens selected at Paris by one of the professors. The medical student has the use of the Public Library upon the same footing as academical students, and may have ready access to most of the standard works in his profession. An annual appropriation is allowed by the authorities of the University for the purpose of securing subjects, and ample means for dissection, are thus afforded to each student, at the trifling cost of five dollars. Arrangements have been made, which, it is confidently expected, will enable the professors to deliver clinical lectures at an Infirmary to be established within the precincts. The expenses for the session of upwards of ten months, commencing on the first of September, and exclusive of books, stationary, clothing, pocket money, dissecting fee, &amp;c., are limited to $ 238. This sum provides for board, including bed and other room furnitureâwashing and attendanceâfuel and candlesârent of a Dormitoryâuse of the Library and public rooms, and fees to the Professors.</field>
