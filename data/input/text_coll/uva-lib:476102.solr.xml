      <field name="fulltext">Dedicated TO MY FIRST LOVE, MY MOTHER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part I: INDOORS [page intentionally blank] The Long View SOME day of days! Some dawning yet to be I shall be clothed with immortality! And, in that day, I shall not greatly careThat Jane spilt candle grease upon thestair. It will not grieve me then, as once it did,That careless hands have chipped myteapot lid. I groan, being burdened. But, in thatglad day,I shall forget vexations of the way. That needs were often great, when meanswere small,Will not perplex me any more at all A few short years at most (it may be less),I shall have done with earthly storm andstress. So, for this day, I lay me at Thy feet.O, keep me sweet, my Master! Keepme sweet! Within my House FIRST, there's the entrance, narrow,and so small,The hat-stand seems to fill the tiny hall;That staircase, too, has such an awkwardbend,The carpet rucks, and rises up on end!Then, all the rooms are cramped and closetogether;And there's a musty smell in rainy weather.Yes, and it makes the daily work go hardTo have the only tap across a yard.These creaking doors, these draughts, thisbattered paint,Would try, I think, the temper of a saint, How often had I railed against thesethings,With envies, and with bitter murmurings For spacious rooms, and sunny gardenplots!Until one day,Washing the breakfast dishes, so I think,I paused a moment in my work to pray;And then and thereAll life seemed suddenly made new andfair;For, like the Psalmist's dove among thepots(Those endless pots, that filled the tinysink!),My spirit found her wings. "Lord" (thus I prayed), "it matters notat allThat my poor home is ill-arranged andsmall:I, not the house, am straitened; Lord,'tis I!Enlarge my foolish heart, that by-and-byI may look up with such a radiant faceThou shalt have glory even in this place.And when I trip, or stumble unawaresIn carrying water up these awkward stairs. Then keep me sweet, and teach me dayby dayTo tread with patience Thy appointedway.As for the house . . . . Lord, let it bemy partTo walk within it with a perfect heart." The Housewife SEE, I am cumbered, Lord,With serving, and with small vexatiousthings.Upstairs, and down, my feetMust hasten, sure and fleet.So weary that I cannot heed Thy word;So tired, I cannot now mount up withwings.I wrestle â how I wrestle! â through thehours.Nay, not with principalities, nor powers âDark spiritual foes of God's and man's âBut with antagonistic pots and pans:With footmarks in the hall,With smears upon the wall,With doubtful ears, and small unwashenhands,And with a babe's innumerable demands. I toil with feverish haste, while tear-dropsglisten, (O, child of mine, be still. And listen âlisten!) At last, I laid asideImportant work, no other hands could doSo well (I thought), no skill contrive sotrue.And with my heart's door open â openwide âWith leisured feet, and idle hands, I sat.I, foolish, fussy, blind as any bat,Sat down to listen, and to learn. And lo,My thousand tasks were done the better so. To Mother I WOULD that you should know,Dear mother, that I love you â loveyou so!That I remember other days and years;Remember childish joys and childish fears.And this, because my baby's little handOpened my own heart's door and mademe understand. I wonder how you could Be always kind and good!So quick to hear; to tendMy smallest ills; to lendSuch sympathising earsSwifter than ancient seer's.I never yet knew hands so soft and kind,Nor any cheek so smooth, nor any mindSo full of tender thoughts. . . . Dearmother, now I think that I can guess a little howYou must have looked for some response,some sign,That all my tiresome wayward heart wasthine. And sure it was! You were my first dearlove!You who first pointed me to God above;You who seemed hearkening to my lightestword,And in the dark night seasons alwaysheardWhen I came trembling, knocking at yourdoor.Forgive me, mother, if my whims outworeYour patient heart. Or if in later daysI sought out foolish unfamiliar ways;If ever, mother dear, I loosed my holdOf your loved hand; or, headstrong,thought you cold,Forgive me, mother! Oh, forgive me,dear!I am come back at last â you see mehere. Your loving child. . . . And, mother,on my kneeI pray that thus my child may think ofme! In Such an Hour SOMETIMES, when everything goeswrong:When days are short, and nights are long;When wash-day brings so dull a skyThat not a single thing will dry.And when the kitchen chimney smokes,And when there's naught so "queer" asfolks!When friends deplore my faded youth,And when the baby cuts a tooth.While John, the baby last but one,Clings round my skirts till day is done;When fat, good-tempered Jane is glum,And butcher's man forgets to come. Sometimes, I say, on days like these,I get a sudden gleam of bliss."Not on some sunny day of ease,He'll come . . but on a day like this!" And, in the twinkling of an eye,These tiresome things will all go by! And, 'tis a curious thing, but JaneIs sure, just then, to smile again;Or, out the truant sun will peep,And both the babies fall asleep.The fire burns up with roar sublime,And butcher's man is just in time.And oh! My feeble faith grows strongSometimes, when everything goes wrong! The Daily Interview SUCH a sensation Sundays preachermade."Christian!" he cried, "what is your stock-in-trade?Alas! Too often nil. No time to pray;No interview with Christ from day to day,A hurried prayer, maybe, just gabbledthrough;A random text â for any one will do."Then gently, lovingly, with look intense,He leaned towards us â"Is this common sense?No person in his rightful mind will tryTo run his business so, lest by-and-byThe thing collapses, smirching his goodname,And he, insolvent, face the world withshame." I heard it all; and something inly saidThat all was true. The daily toil and pressHad crowded out my hopes of holiness.Still, my old self rose, reasoning:How can you,With strenuous work to do âReal slogging work â say, how can youkeep paceWith leisured folks? Why, you couldgrow in graceIf you had time . . . the daily InterviewWas never meant for those who wash andbake. But yet a small Voice whispered:"For My sakeKeep tryst with Me!There are so many minutes in a day,So spare Me ten.It shall be proven, then,Ten minutes set apart can well repayYou shall accomplish moreIf you will shut your doorFor ten short minutes just to watch andpray." "Lord, if I doSet ten apart for You"(I dared, yes dared, to reason thus withHim)"The baker's sure to come;Or Jane will callTo say some visitor is in the hall;Or I shall smell the porridge burning, yes,And run to stop it in my hastiness.There's not ten minutes, Lord, in all thedayI can be sure of peace in which to watchand pray." But all that night,With calm insistent might,That gentle Voice spake softly, lovingly â"Keep tryst with Me!You have devised a dozen different waysOf getting easy meals on washing days;You spend much anxious thought onhopeless socks;On moving ironmould from tiny frocks;'Twas you who foundA way to make the sugar lumps go round; You, who invented ways and means ofmakingNice spicy buns for tea, hot from the baking,When margarine was short . . . and cannotyouWho made the time to join the butter queueMake time again for Me?Yes, will you not, with all your dailystriving,Use woman's wit in scheming and contrivingTo keep that tryst with Me?" Like ice long boundOn powdered frosty ground,My erring will all suddenly gave way.The kind soft wind of His sweet pleadingblew,And swiftly, silently, before I knew,The warm love loosed and ran.Life-giving floods began,And so most lovingly I answered Him:"Lord, yes, I will, and can.I will keep tryst with Thee, Lord, comewhat may!" ENVOY. It is a wondrous and surprising thingHow that ten minutes takes the piercingstingFrom vexing circumstance and poisonousdartHurled by the enemy straight at myheart.So, to the woman tempest-tossed andtriedBy household cares, and hosts of thingsbeside,With all my strength God bids me sayto you:"Dear soul, do try the daily Interview!" The Little House ONE yestereve, in the waning light,When the wind was still and thegloaming bright,There came a breath from a far countrie,And the ghost of a Little House calledto me. "Have you forgotten me?" "No!" I cried."Your hall was as narrow as this is wide,Your roof was leaky, the rain camethroughTill a ceiling fell, on my new frock too! "In your parlour flooring a loose board hid,And wore the carpet, you know it did!Your kitchen was small, and the shelveswere few,While the fireplace smoked â and youknow it's true!" The little ghost sighed: "Do you quiteforgetMy window boxes of mignonette?And the sunny room where you used tosewWhen a great hope came to you, long ago? "Ah, me! How you used to watch thedoorWhere a latch-key turned on the strokeof four.And you made the tea, and you pouredit outFrom an old brown pot with a brokenspout "Now, times have changed. And yourfootman waitsWith the silver urn, and the fluted plates.But the little blind Love with the wings,has flown,Who used to sit by your warm hearthstone." The little ghost paused. Then "Away!"I said."Back to your place with the quiet dead.Back to your place, lest my servants see,That the ghost of a Little House callsto me." The House-Mother ACROSS the town the evening bell isringing;Clear comes the call, through kitchenwindows winging! Lord, knowing Thou art kind,I heed Thy call to prayer.I have a soul to save;A heart which needs, I think, a doubleshareOf sweetnesses which noble ladies crave.Hope, faith and diligence, and patientcare,With meekness, grace, and lowliness ofmind.Lord, wilt Thou grant all theseTo one who prays, but cannot sit at ease? They do not know,The passers-by, who goUp to Thy house, with saintly faces set;Who throng about Thy seat,And sing Thy praises sweet,Till vials full of odours cloud Thy feet;They do not know . . .And, if they knew, then would they greatlycareThat Thy tired handmaid washed thechildren's hair;Or, with red roughened hands, scoureddishes well,While through the window called theevening bell?And that her seeking soul looks upwardyet,They do not know . . . but Thou wiltnot forget A Woman in Hospital I KNOW it all . . . I know.For I am God. I am Jehovah, HeWho made you what you are; and I canseeThe tears that wet your pillow night bynight,When nurse has lowered that too-brilliantlight;When the talk ceases, and the ward growsstill,And you have doffed your will:I know the anguish and the helplessness.I know the fears that toss you to and fro.And how you wrestle, weariful,With hosts of little strings that pullAbout your heart, and tear it so.I know. Lord, do You knowI had no time to put clean curtains up;No time to finish darning all the socks;Nor sew clean frilling in the children'sfrocks?And do You know about my Baby's cold?And how things are with my sweet three-year-old?Will Jane remember rightTheir cough mixture at night?And will she ever thinkTo brush the kitchen flues, or scrub thesink?And then, there's John! Poor tiredlonely John!No one will run to put his slippers on.And not a soul but meKnows just exactly how he likes his tea.It rends my heart to think I cannot goAnd minister to him. . . .I know. I know.Then, there are other things,Dear Lord . . . more little strings That pull my heart. Now Baby feels herfeetShe loves to run outside into the streetAnd Jane's hands are so full, she'll neversee. . . .And I'm quite sure the clean clothes won'tbe aired âAt least, not properly.And, oh, I can't, I really can't be spared âMy little house calls so!I know.And I am waiting here to help and bless.Lay down your head. Lay down your hopelessnessAnd let Me speak.You are so weary, child, you are so weak.But let us reason outThe darkness and the doubt;This torturing fear that tosses you about.I hold the universe. I count the stars.And out of shortened lives I build theages. . . . But, Lord, while such high things Thythought engages,I fear â forgive me â lestAmid those limitless eternal spacesThou shouldest, in the high and heavenlyplaces,Pass over my affairs as things of nought.There are so many houses just like mine.And I so earth-bound, and Thyself Divine.It seems impossible that Thou shouldstcareJust what my babies wear;And what John gets to eat; . . . andcan it beA circumstance of great concern to TheeWhether I live or die?Have you forgotten then, My child, that I,The Infinite, the Limitless, laid downThe method of existence that I knew,And took on Me a nature just like you?I laboured day by dayIn the same dogged wayThat you have tackled household tasks.And then, Remember, child, remember once againYour own beloveds . . . did you reallythink â(Those days you toiled to get their meatand drink,And made their clothes, and tried to understandTheir little ailments) â did you think yourhand,Your feeble hand, was keeping them from ill?I gave them life, and life is more than meat;Those little limbs, so comely and so sweet.You can make raiment for them, and are glad,But can you addOne cubit to their stature? Yet they grow!Oh, child, hands off! Hands off! Andleave them so.I guarded hitherto, I guard them still.I have let go at last. I have let go.And, oh, the rest it is, dear God, to knowMy dear ones are so safe, for Thou wiltkeep.Hands off, at last! Now, I can go tosleep. In Convalescence NOT long ago, I prayed for dyinggrace,For then I thought to see Thee face toface.And now I ask (Lord, 'tis a weakling'scry)That Thou wilt give me grace to live, notdie.Such foolish prayers! I know. Yetpray I must.Lord help me â help me not to see thedust!And not to nag, nor fret because the blindHangs crooked, and the curtain sags behind. But, oh! The kitchen cupboards! What asight!'T'will take at least a month to get themright.And that last cocoa had a smoky taste,And all the milk has boiled away to waste!And â no, I resolutely will not thinkAbout the saucepans, nor about the sink.These light afflictions are but temporalthings âTo rise above them, wilt Thou lend mewings?Then I shall smile when Jane, with towzledhair(And lumpy gruel!), clatters up the stair. Homesick I SHUT my eyes to rest 'em, just a bitago it seems,An' back among the Cotswolds I werewanderin' in me dreams.I saw the old grey homestead, with therickyard set around,An' catched the lowin' of the herd, apleasant, homelike sound.Then on I went a-singin', through thepastures where the sheepWas lyin' underneath the elms, a-tryin' forto sleep.An' where the stream was tricklin' by, halfstifled by the grass,Heaped over thick with buttercups, I sawthe corncrake pass.For 'twas Summer, Summer, SUMMER!An' the blue forget-me-nots Wiped out this dusty city and the smokychimbley pots.I clean forgot My Lady's gown, thedazzlin' sights I've seen;I was back among the Cotswolds, whereme heart has always been.Then through the sixteen-acre on I went,a stiffish climb,Right to the bridge, where all our sheepcomes up at shearin' time.There was the wild briar roses hangin'down so pink an' sweet,A-droppin' o' their fragrance on the cloverat my feetAn' here me heart stopped beatin', fordown by Gatcombe's WoodMy lad was workin' with his team, as onlymy lad could!"Come back!" was what the tricklin' brookan' breezes seemed to say."'Tis lonesome on the Cotswolds now thatMary Drew's away." An' back again I'm goin' (for me wageshas been paid,An' they're lookin' through the papers foranother kitchen maid).Back to the old grey homestead, an' theuplands cool an' green,To my lad among the Cotswolds, whereme heart has always been! On Washing Day "I'M going to gran'ma's for a bitMy mother's got the copper lit;An' piles of clothes are on the floor,An' steam comes out the wash-house door;An' Mrs. Griggs has come, an' sheIs just as cross as she can be.She's had her lunch, and ate a lot;I saw her squeeze the coffee-pot.An' when I helped her make the starch,She said: 'Now, Miss, you just quickmarch!What? Touch them soap-suds if youdurst;I'll see you in the blue-bag first!'An' mother dried my frock, an' said:'Come back in time to go to bed.'I'm off to gran'ma's, for, you see,At home, they can't put up with me."But down at gran'ma's 'tis so nice.If gran'ma's making currant-cake,She'll let me put the ginger spice,An' grease the tin, an' watch it bake;An' then she says she thinks it funTo taste the edges when it's done. "That's gran'ma's house. Why, hip,hooray!My gran'ma's got a washing day;For gran'pa's shirts are on the line,An' stockings, too â six, seven, eight, nine!She'll let me help her. Yes, she'll tieHer apron round to keep me dry;An' on her little stool I'll standUp to the wash-tub. 'Twill be grand!There's no cross Mrs. Griggs to say,'Young Miss is always in the way.'An' me and gran'ma will have teaAt dinner-time â just her an' me âAn' eggs, I 'spect, an' treacle rice.My goodness! Won't it all be nice? "Gran'ma, I'm come to spend the day,'Cause mother finds me in the way. Gran'ma, I'll peg the hankies out;Gran'ma, I'll stir the starch about;Gran'ma, I'm come, because, you see,At home, they can't put up with me." When Baby Strayed WHEN Baby strayed, it seemed tome,Sun, moon and stars waned suddenly.At once, with frenzied haste, my feetRan up and down the busy street.If ever in my life I prayed,It was the evening Baby strayed.And yet my great concern was this(Not dread of losing Baby's kiss,And Baby's soft small hand in mine,And Baby's comradeship divine),'Twas Baby's terror, Baby's fears!Whose hand but mine could dry hertears?I without Baby? In my needI were a piteous soul indeed.But piteous far, beyond all other,A little child without a mother.And God, in mercy, graciouslyGave my lost darling back to me.O high and lofty One!Thou couldst have lived to all eternityApart from me!In majesty, upon that emerald throne.Thou, with Thy morning stars,Thy dawns, with golden bars,And all the music of the heavenly train.Possessing all things, what hadst Thou togainBy seeking me?What was I? . . . and, what am I? . . .less than nought.And yet Thy mercy sought.Yea, Thou hast set my feetUpon the way of holiness, and sweetIt is, to seek Thee daily, unafraid . . .But (this I learnt the night that Babystrayed)Here was Thy chief, Thy great concernfor me:My desolate estate, apart from Thee! If Only â IF only dinner cooked itself,And groceries grew upon the shelf;If children did as they were told,And never had a cough or cold;And washed their hands, and wiped theirboots,And never tore their Sunday suits,But always tidied up the floor,Nor once forgot to shut the door.If John remembered not to throwHis papers on the ground. And oh!If he would put his pipes away,And shake the ashes on the trayInstead of on the floor close by;And always spread his towel to dry,And hung his hat upon the peg,And never had bones in his leg.Then, there's another thing. If JaneWould put the matches back againJust where she found them, it would beA save of time to her and me.And if she never did forgetTo put the dustbin out; nor yetContrive to gossip with the baker,Nor need ten thunderbolts to wake her.Ahem! If wishes all came true,I don't know what I'd find to do,Because if no one made a messThere'd be no need of cleanliness.And things might work so blissfully,In time â who knows? â they'd not needme!And this being so, I fancy whetherI'll go on keeping things together. Listening HIS step? Ah, no; 'tis but the rainThat hurtles on the window pane.Let's draw the curtains close and sitBeside the fire awhile and knit.Two purl â two plain. A well-shapedsock,And warm. (I thought I heard a knock,But 'twas the slam of Jones's door.)Yes, good Scotch yarn is far beforeThe fleecy wools â a different thing,And best for wear. (Was that his ring?)No. 'Tis the muffin man I see;We'll have threepennyworth for tea.Two plain â two purl; that heel is neat.(I hear his step far down the street.)Two purl â two plain. The sock canwait;I'll make the tea. (He's at the gate!) The Dear Folks in Devon BACK in the dear old country 'tis Christmas,and to-nightI'm thinking of the mistletoe and hollyberries bright.The smoke above our chimbley pots I'ddearly love to see,And those dear folks down in Devon,how they'll talk and think of me.Owd Ben'll bring the letters, Christmasmorn, and if there's oneAs comes across from Canada straightfrom their absent son,My Mother's hands'll tremble, and myDad'll likely say:"Don't seem like Christmas time no more,with our dear lad away."I can see 'em carve the Christmas beef,and Brother Jimmy's wifeWill say her never tasted such, no, not inall her life.And Sister Martha's Christmas pies meltin your mouth, 'tis true,But 'twas Mother made the puddin', asmothers always do!Ah me! If I could just have wings, andin the dimsey lightGo stealing up the cobbled path thislonesome Christmas night,Lift up the latch with gentle hand â My!What a shout there'd be!From those dear folks down in Devon!What a welcomin' for me! The Reason "Why shouldest Thou be as a wayfaring man, that turneth aside to tarry for a night?" â Jer. xiv. 8. NAY, do not get the venison pastyout;I shall not greatly put myself aboutHungry, he may be; yes, and we shallspareSome bread and cheese, 'tis truly wholesomefare.We have to-morrow's dinner still to find;It's well for you I have a frugal mind.Not the best bed! No, no. Whatevernext?Why with such questionings should I bevext?The man is naught to us; why shouldwe care?The little attic room will do; 'tis bare,But he'll be gone before to-morrow's light;He has but come to tarry for a night.I shall not speak with him. Oh, no, not I,Lest I should pity overmuch, or buySome paltry ware of his. Nay, I'll tobed,And he can sup alone, well warmed andfed;'Tis much to take him in a night like this.Why should I fret me with concerns ofhis?Grey morning came, and at the break ofdayThe Man rose up and went upon his way Two Women "I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord" â Phil. iv. 2, EUODIAS. BUT if Paul heard her tattlings, I amsureHe never would expect me to endure.There is a something in her very faceAntagonistic to the work of grace.And even when I would speak graciouslySomehow, Syntyche's manner ruffles me.SYNTYCHE.No, not for worlds! Euodias has nomind;So slow she is, so spiritually blind.Her tongue is quite unbridled, yet shesaysShe grieves to see my aggravating waysAh, no one but myself knows perfectlyHow odious Euodias can be!EUODIAS. Yet, "in the Lord." Ah, that's anotherthing!SYNTYCHE.Yet, "in the Lord." That alters it indeed.EUODIAS.For His sake I'll endure her whisperingSYNTYCHE.For His sake I'll consent to let her lead.EUODIAS.Lord, teach me to forbear; yes, day byday.SYNTYCHE.Lord, keep me gentle now, and all theway. The Prize Fight "I am a boxer, who does not inflict blows on the air, but I hit hard and straight at my own body." â 1 Cor. ix. 26 (WEYMOUTH'S Translation). 'T'WAS breakfast time, and outside inthe streetThe factory men went by with hurryingfeet.And on the bridge, in dim December light,The newsboys shouted of the great prizefight.Then, as I dished the bacon, and servedoutThe porridge, all our youngsters gavea shout.The letter-box had clicked, and throughthe dinThe Picture News was suddenly pushed in.John showed the lads the pictures, andexplainedJust how the fight took place, and whatwas gainedBy that slim winner. Then, he looked at meAs I sat, busy, pouring out the tea:"Your mother is a boxer, rightly styled.She hits the air sometimes, though," andJohn smiled."Yet she fights on." Young Jack, withwidened eyesSaid: "Dad, how soon will mother get aprize?"We laughed. And yet it set me thinking,howI beat the air, because a neighbour's cowMunched at our early cabbages, and ateThe lettuce up, and tramped my mignonette!And many a time I kicked against thepricksBecause the little dog at number sixDisturbed my rest. And then, how crossI gotWhen Jane seemed discontented with herlot.Until poor John in desperation saidHe wearied of the theme â and went tobed!And how I vexed myself that day, when heBrought people unexpectedly for tea,Because the table-cloth was old andstained,And not a single piece of cake remained.And how my poor head ached! Because,well there!It uses lots of strength to beat the air!"I am a boxer!" Here and now I prayFor grace to hit the self-life every day.And when the old annoyance comes oncemoreAnd the old temper rises sharp and sore,I shall hit hard and straight, O Tender-Wise,And read approval in Thy loving eyes. The Home Lights "IN my father's house!" The wordsBring sweet cadence to my ears.Wandering thoughts, like homing birds,Fly all swiftly down the years,To that wide casement, where I always seeBright love-lamps leaning out to welcomeme.Sweet it was, how sweet to goTo the worn, familiar door.No need to stand a while, and wait,Outside the well-remembered gate;No need to knock;The easy lockTurned almost of itself, and soMy spirit was "at home" once more.And then, within, how good to findThe same cool atmosphere of peace,Where I, a tired child, might ceaseTo grieve, or dread,Or toil for bread.I could forgetThe dreary fret.The strivings after hopes too high,I let them every one go by.The ills of life, the blows unkind,These fearsome things were left behind.ENVOY.O trembling soul of mine,See how God's mercies shine!When thou shalt rise,And, stripped of earth, shall standWithin an Unknown Land;Alone, where no familiar thingMay bring familiar comforting;Look up! 'Tis but thy Father'sHouse! And, seeHis love-lamps leaning out to welcomethee! To an Old Teapot NOW from the dust of half-forgottenthings,You rise to haunt me at the year's Spring-cleaning,And bring to memory dim imaginingsOf mystic meaning.No old-time potter handled you, I ween,Nor yet were you of gold or silver molten;No Derby stamp, nor Worcester, can beseen,Nor Royal Doulton.You never stood to grace the princelyboardOf monarchs in some Oriental palace.Your lid is chipped, your chubby side isscoredAs if in malice.I hesitate to say it, but your spoutIs with unhandsome rivets held together âMute witnesses of treatment meted outIn regions nether.O patient sufferer of many bumps!I ask it gently â shall the dustbin holdyou?And will the dust-heap, with its cabbagestumps,At last enfold you?It ought. And yet with gentle hands IplaceYou with my priceless Delft and Dresdenchina,For sake of one who loved your homelyfaceIn days diviner. To a Rebellious Daughter YOU call authority "a grievous thing."With careless hands you snap theleading string,And, for a frolic (so it seems to you),Put off the old love, and put on the new.For "What does Mother know of love?"you say."Did her soul ever thrill?Did little tendernesses ever creepInto her dreams, and over-ride her will?Did her eyes shine, or her heart ever leapAs my heart leaps to-day?I, who am young; who long to try mywings!How should she understand,She, with her calm cool hand?She never felt such yearnings? And,beside,It's clear I can't be tiedFor ever to my mother's apron strings."There are Infinities of Knowledge, dear.And there are mysteries, not yet madeclearTo you, the Uninitiate. . . . Life's bookIs open, yes; but you may only lookAt its first section. YouthIs part, not all, the truth.It is impossible that you should seeThe end from the beginning perfectly.You answer: "Even so.But how can Mother know,Who meditates upon the price of bacon?On 'liberties' the charwoman has taken,And on the laundry's last atrocities?She knows her cookery book,And how a joint of English meat shouldlook.But all such things as theseMake up her life. She dwells in tents,but IIn a vast temple open to the sky."Yet, time was, when that Mother stoopedto learnThe language written in your infant face.For years she walked your pace,And none but she interpreted your chatter.Who else felt interest in such pitter-patter?Or, weary, joined in all your games withzest,And managed with a minimum of rest?Now, is it not your turnTo bridge the gulf, to span the gap betweenyou?To-day, before Death's angel over-leanyou,Before your chance is gone?This is worth thinking on."Are mothers blameless, then?" Nay,dearie, nay.Nor even tactful, always. Yet there mayCome some grey dawning in the byand by,When, no more brave, nor sure, nor strong,you'll cryAloud to God, for that despised thing,The old dear comfort â Mother's apronstring. For Mothering! UP to the Hall, my lady there'll wearher satin gown,For little Miss and Master'll be comingdown from town.Oh ay, the childern's coming! Thechildern did I say?Of course, they're man and woman grown,this many and many a day.But still, my lady's mouth do smile, andsquire looks fit to sing,As Master John and Miss Elaine is comingMothering.Then down to Farmer Westacott's, there'sdoings fine and grand,Because young Jake is coming home fromsea, you understand.Put into port but yesternight, and whenhe steps ashore,'Tis coming home the laddie is, to Somersetonce more.And so her's baking spicy cakes, and stirringraisins in,To welcome of her only chick, who'scoming Mothering.And what of we? And ain't we got nochildern for to come?Well, yes! There's Sam and Henery,and they'll be coming home.And Ned is very nigh six foot, and Joe issix foot three!But childern still to my good man, andchildern still to me!And all the vi'lets seem to know, and allthe thrushes sing,As how our Kate, and Bess and Flo iscoming Mothering. Little Fan WHEN little Fanny came to town, Ifelt as I could sing!She were the sprackest little maid, thesharpest, pertest thing.Her mother were as proud as punch, andas for I â well, there!I never see sich gert blue eyes, I neversee sich hair!"If all the weans in Somerset," says I,"was standin' here,Not one could hold a candle light, 'longsideour little dear."Now Fanny's little Fan have come! She'sclingin' round my knees,She's asking me for sups of tea, and bitesof bread and cheese.She's climbing into grandma's bed, she'sstroking grandma's face.She's tore my paper into bits and strawedit round the place."If all the weans in all the world," saysI, "was standin' here,Not one could hold a farthin' dip toFanny's little dear!"For Fanny's little Fanny â oh, she's tookthe heart of me!'Tis childern's childern is the crown ofhumble folk like we! The Naughty Day I'VE had a naughty day to-day.I scrunched a biscuit in my hair,And dipped my feeder in the milk,And spread my rusk upon a chair.When mother put me in my bath,I tossed the water all about,And popped the soap upon my head,And threw the sponge and flannel out.I wouldn't let her put my handInside the arm-hole of my vest;I held the sleeve until she saidI really never should be dressed.And while she made the beds, I foundHer tidy, and took out the hairs;And then I got the water-canAnd tipped it headlong down the stairs.I crawled along the kitchen floor,And got some coal out of the box,And drew black pictures on the walls,And wiped my fingers on my socks.Oh, this has been a naughty day!That's why they've put me off to bed."He can't get into mischief there,Perhaps we'll have some peace," theysaid.They put the net across my cot,Or else downstairs again I'd creep.But, see, I'll suck the counterpaneTo pulp before I go to sleep! To a Little White Bird INTO the world you came, and I wasdumb,Because "God did it," so the wise onessaid;I wonder sometimes "Did you reallycome?"And "Are you truly . . . dead?"Thus you went out â alone and uncaressed;O sweet, soft thing, in all your infantgrace,I never held you in my arms, nor pressedWarm kisses on your face!But, in the Garden of the Undefiled,My soul will claim you . . . you, andnot another;I shall hold out my arms, and say "Mychild!"And you will call me "Mother!" Because (PSALM CXVI.)BECAUSE He heard my voice, andanswered me,Because He listened, ah, so patiently,In those dark days, when sorrowful, alone,I knelt with tears, and prayed Him for astone;Because He said me "Nay," and then instead,Oh, wonderful sweet truth! He gave mebread,Set my heart singing all in sweet accord;Because of this, I love â I love the Lord! When He Comes "When He comes!My sweetest 'When'!" C. ROSSETTI. THUS may it be (I thought) at someday's close,Some lilac-haunted eve, when every roseBreathes forth its incense. May He findme there,In holy leisure, lifting hands of prayer,In some sweet garden place,To catch the first dear wonder of His Face!Or, in my room above,In silent meditation of His love,My soul illumined with a rapture rare.It would be sweet, if even then, these eyesMight glimpse Him coming in the Easternskies,And be caught up to meet Him in theair.But now! Ah, now, the daysRush by their hurrying ways!No longer know I vague imaginings,For every hour has wings.Yet my heart watches . . . as I work Isay,All simply, to Him: "Come! And if to-day,Then wilt Thou find me thus: just as Iam âTending my household; stirring gooseberryjam;Or swiftly rinsing tiny vests and hose,With puzzled forehead patching some one'sclothes;Guiding small footsteps, swift to hear, andrun,From early dawn till setting of the sun."And whensoe'er He comes, I'll rise and go,Yes, all the gladlier that He found me so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part II: OUT OF DOORS [page intentionally blank] Early Spring QUICK through the gates of FairylandThe South Wind forced his way.'Twas his to make the Earth forgetHer grief of yesterday."'Tis mine," cried he, "to bring her joy!"And on his lightsome feetIn haste he slung the snowdrop bells,Pushed past the Fairy sentinels,And out with laughter sweet.Clear flames of Crocus glimmered onThe shining way he went.He whispered to the trees strange talesOf wondrous sweet intent,When, suddenly, his witching voiceWith timbre rich and rare,Rang through the woodlands till it cleftEarth's silent solitudes, and leftA Dream of Roses there! The Witness THE Master of the Garden said;"Who, now the Earth seems coldand dead,Will by his fearless witnessingHold men's hearts for the tardy spring?""Not yet. I am but half awake,"All drowsily the Primrose spake.And fast the sleeping DaffodilsHad folded up their golden frills."Indeed," the frail AnemoneSaid softly, "'tis too cold for me."Wood Hyacinths, all deeply set,Replied: "No ice has melted yet."When suddenly, with smile so bright,Up sprang a Winter Aconite,And to the Master joyfullyShe cried: "I will the witness be." In Somerset IN Somerset they guide the ploughFrom early dawn till twilight now.The good red earth smells sweeter yet,Behind the plough, in Somerset.The celandines round last year's mowBlaze out . . . and with his old-time vowThe South Wind woos the Violet,In Somerset.Then, every brimming dyke and troughIs laughing wide with ripples now,And oh, 'tis easy to forgetThat wintry winds can sigh and sough,When thrushes chant on every boughIn Somerset! Song of a Woodland Stream SILENT was I, and so still,As day followed day.Imprisoned untilKing Frost worked his will.Held fast like a vice,In his cold hand of ice,For fear kept me silent, and loHe had wrapped me around and aboutwith a mantle of snow.But sudden there spakeOne greater than he.Then my heart was awake,And my spirit ran free.At His bidding my bands fell apart, Hehad burst them asunder.I can feel the swift wind rushing by me,once more the old wonderOf quickening sap stirs my pulses â Ishout in my gladness,Forgetting the sadness,For the Voice of the Lord fills the air!And forth through the hollow I go, wherein glad April weather,The trees of the forest break out intosinging together.And here the frail windflowers will cluster,with young ferns uncurling,Where broader and deeper my waters goeddying, whirling,To meet the sweet Spring on her journeyâ His servant to be,Whose word set me free! Luggage in Advance "THE Fairies must have come," Isaid,"For through the moist leaves, brown anddead,The Primroses are pushing up,And here's a scarlet Fairy-cup.They must have come, because I seeA single Wood Anemone,The flower that everybody knowsThe Fairies use to scent their clothes.And hark! The South Wind blowing, fillsThe trumpets of the Daffodils.They must have come!"Then loud to meSang from a budding cherry tree,A cheerful Thrush . . . "I say! I say!The Fairy Folk are on their way.Look out! Look out! Beneath your feet,Are all their treasures: Sweet! Sweet!Sweet!They could not carry them, you see,Those caskets crammed with witchery,So ready for the first Spring dance,They sent their Luggage in Advance!" At the Cross Roads THERE I halted. Further down thehollowStood the township, where my errand lay.Firm my purpose, till a voice cried(Follow!Come this way â I tell you â come thisway!)Silence, Thrush! You know I think ofbuyingA Spring-tide hat; my frock is worn andold.So to the shops I go. What's that you'recrying?(Here! Come here! And gather primrosegold.)Well, yes. Some day I will; but time isgoing.I haste to purchase silks and satins fair.I'm all in rags. (The Lady's Smock isshowingUp yonder, in the little coppice there.)And wood anemones spread out theirlaces;Each celandine has donned a silken gown;The violets are lifting shy sweet faces.(And there's a chiff-chaff, soft, and slim, andbrown.)But what about my hat? (The bees arehumming.)And my new frock? (The hawthorn'sbudding free!Sweet! Oh, so sweet!) Well, have yourway. I'm coming!And who's to blame for that? (Why, me!Me! Me!) Summer met Me SUMMER met me in the glade,With a host of fair princesses,Golden iris, foxgloves staid,Sunbeams flecked their gorgeous dresses.Roses followed in her train,Creamy elder-flowers beset me,Singing, down the scented lane,Summer met me!Summer met me! Harebells rang,Honeysuckle clustered near,As the royal pageant sangSongs enchanting to the ear.Rainy days may come apace,Nevermore to grieve or fret me,Since, in all her radiant grace,Summer met me! The Carrier "OWD John's got past his work," saidthey,Last week as ever was â "don't payTo send by him. He's stoopid, too,And brings things what won't never do.We'll send by post, he is that slow.And that owd hoss of his can't go."But 'smornin', well, 'twas fun to seeThe gentlefolks run after we.Squire's lady stopped I in the lane,"Oh," says she, "goin' to town again?You'll not mind calling into BingsTo fetch my cakes and buns and things?I've got a party comin' on,And nought to eat . . . so, do 'ee, John."Then, up the street, who should I see,But old Mam Bessant hail'n' me.And Doctor's wife, and Mrs. HiggsWas wantin' vittles for their pigs,And would I bring some? (Well, whatnex'?)And Granny Dunn has broke her specs,And wants 'em mended up in town,So would John call and bring 'em downTo-night . . . ? and so the tale goes on,'Tis, "Sure you will, now do 'ee, John."Well, 'tis a hevil wind that blowsNobody any good; it showsAs owd John haves his uses yet,Though now and then he do forget.Gee up, owd gal. When strikes is on,They're glad of pore owd stoopid John. The Lad's Love by the Gate DOWN in the dear West Country,there's a garden where I knowThe Spring is rioting this hour, thoughI am far away âWhere all the glad flower-faces are oldloves of long ago,And each in its accustomed place isblossoming to-day.The lilac drops her amethysts upon themossy wall,While in her boughs a cheerful thrushis calling to his mate.Dear breath of mignonette and stocks!I love you, know you all.And, oh, the fragrant spices from thelad's love by the gate!Kind wind from the West Country, wetwind, but scented so,That straight from my dear gardenyou seem but lately come,Just tell me of the yellow broom, theguelder rose's snow,And of the tangled clematis wheremyriad insects hum.Oh, is there any heartsease left, or anyrosemary?And in their own green solitudes, say,do the lilies wait?I knew it! Gentle wind, but once âspeak low and tenderly âHow fares it â tell me truly â with thelad's love by the gate? The Thrush ACROSS the land came a magic wordWhen the earth was bare andlonely,And I sit and sing of the joyous spring,For 'twas I who heard, I only!Then dreams came by, of the gladsomedays,Of many a wayside posy;For a crocus peeps where the wild rosesleeps,And the willow wands are rosy!Oh! the time to be! When the pathsare green,When the primrose-gold is lying'Neath the hazel spray, where the catkinssway,And the dear south wind comes sighing.My mate and I, we shall build a nest,So snug and warm and cosy,When the kingcups gleam on the meadowstream,Where the willow wands are rosy! In Dorset Dear IN Dorset Dear they're making hayIn just the old West Country way.With fork and rake and old-time gearThey make the hay in Dorset Dear.From early morn till twilight greyThey toss and turn and shake the hay.And all the countryside is gayWith roses on the fallen may,For 'tis the hay-time of the yearIn Dorset Dear.The loaded waggons wend their wayAcross the pasture-lands, and stayBeside the hedge where foxgloves peer;And ricks that shall be fashioned hereWill be the sweetest stuff, they say,In Dorset Dear! The Flight of the Fairies THERE'S a rustle in the woodlands,and a sighing in the breeze,For the Little Folk are busy in the bushesand the trees;They are packing up their treasures, everyone with nimble hand,Ready for the coming journey back tosunny Fairyland.They have gathered up the jewels fromtheir beds of mossy green,With all the dewy diamonds that summermorns have seen;The silver from the lichen and thepowdered gold dust, too,Where the buttercups have flourished andthe dandelions grew.They packed away the birdies' songs,then, lest we should be sad,They left the Robin's carol out, to makethe winter glad;They packed the fragrance of the flowers,then, lest we should forget,Out of the pearly scented box theydropped a Violet.Then o'er a leafy carpet, by the silentwoods they came,Where the golden bracken lingered andthe maples were aflame.On the stream the starlight shimmered, o'ertheir wings the moonbeams shone,Music filtered through the forest â and theLittle Folk were gone! The Street Player THE shopping had been tedious, andthe rainCame pelting down as she turned homeagain.The motor-bus swirled past with rush andwhirr,Nought but its fumes of petrol left forher.The bloaters in her basket, and the cheeseMalodorously mixed themselves withthese.And all seemed wrong. The world wasdrab and greyAs the slow minutes wept themselvesaway.And then, athwart the noises of the street,A violin flung out an Irish air."I'll take you home again, Kathleen."Ah, sweet,How tender-sweet those lilting phraseswere!They soothed away the weariness, andbroughtSuch peace to one worn woman, overwrought,That she forgot the things which vexedher so:The too outrageous price of calico,The shop-girl's look of pitying insolenceBecause she paused to count the dwindlingpence.The player stopped. But the rapt visionstayed.That woman faced life's worries unafraid.The sugar shortage now had ceased to beAn insurmountable calamity.Her kingdom was not bacon, no, norbutter,But things more costly still, too rare toutter.And, over chimney-pots, so bare and tall,The sun set gloriously, after all. On All Souls' Eve OH, the garden ways are lonely!Winds that bluster, winds thatshout,Battle with the strong laburnum,Toss the sad brown leaves about.In the gay herbaceous border,Now a scene of wild disorder,The last dear hollyhock has flamed hiscrimson glory out.Yet, upon this night of longing,Souls are all abroad, they say.Will they come, the dazzling blossoms,That were here but yesterday?Will the ghosts of radiant rosesAnd my sheltered lily-closesHold once more their shattered fragrancenow November's on her way?Wallflowers, surely you'll remember,Pinks, recall it, will you not?How I loved and watched and tended,Made this ground a hallowed spot:Pansies, with the soft meek faces,Harebells, with a thousand graces:Dear dead loves, I wait and listen. Tellme, have you quite forgot?Hush! They come! For down the pathwaySteals a fragrance honey-sweet.Larkspurs, lilies, stocks, and roses,Hasten now my heart to greet.Stay, oh, stay! My hands would holdyou . . .But the arms that would enfold youCrush the bush of lad's love growing inthe dusk beside my feet. The Log Fire IN her last hour of life the treeGave up her glorious memories,Wild scent of wood anemone,The sapphire blue of April skies.With faint but ever-strength'ning flame,The dew-drenched hyacinthine spiresWere lost, as red-gold bracken came,With maple bathed in living fires.Grey smoke of ancient clematisTowards the silver birch inclined,And deep in thorny fastnessesThe coral bryony entwined.Then softly through the dusky roomThey strayed, fair ghosts of other days,With breath like early cherry bloom,With tender eyes and gentle ways.They glimmered on the sombre walls,They danced upon the oaken floor,Till through the loudly silent hallsJoy reigned majestical once more.Up blazed the fire, and, dazzling clear,One rapturous Spirit radiant stood.'Twas you at last! Yes, you, my dear.We two were back in Gatcombe Wood! God save the King GOD save our gracious King. (ItseemsThe Church is full of bygone dreams.)Long live our noble King. (My own,'Tis hard to stand here all alone.)God save the King. (But, sweetheart, youWere always brave to dare and do.)Send him victorious. (For then,My darling will come home again!)Happy and glorious ('Twill beLike Heaven to him â and what to me?)Long to reign over us. (My dear!And we'd been wedded one short year!)God save our King. (And Lord, I prayKeep my King safe this very day.)Forgive us, thou â great England's kinglyKingThat thus do women National Anthemssing.</field>
