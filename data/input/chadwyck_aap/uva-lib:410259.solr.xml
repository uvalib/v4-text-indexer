      <field name="fulltext">To my friend of November 5th, 1892 INTRODUCTION. In this day when the world is fairly teeming with books,—good books, books written with a motive, books inculcating morals, books teaching lessons,—it seems almost a piece of presumption too great for endurance to foist another upon the market. There is scarcely room in the literary world for amateurs and maiden efforts; the very worthiest are sometimes poorly repaid for their best efforts. Yet, another one is offered the public, a maiden effort,—a little thing with absolutely nothing to commend it, that seeks to do nothing more than amuse. Many of these sketches and verses have appeared in print before, in newspapers and a magazine or two; many are seeing the light of day for the first time. If perchance this collection of idle thoughts may serve to while away an hour or two, or lift for a brief space the load of care from someone's mind, their purpose has been served—the author is satisfied. A. R. M. PREFACE. These fugitive pieces are launched upon the tide of public opinion to sink or swim upon their merit. They will float for a while, but whether they will reach the haven of popularity depends upon their enduring qualities. Some will surely perish, many will reach some port, but time alone will tell if any shall successfully breast the ocean of thought and plant its standard upon the summit of fame. When one enters the domain of authorship, she places herself at the mercy of critics. Were she as sure of being commended by the best and most intelligent of her readers, as she is sure of being condemned by the worst and most ignorant, there would still be a thrill of pleasure in all criticism, for the satisfaction of having received the praise of the first would compensate for the harshness of the latter. Just criticism is wholesome and never wounds the sensibilities of the true author, for it saves her from the danger of an excess of pride which is the greatest foe to individual progress, while it spurs her on to loftier flights and nobler deeds. A poor writer is bad, but a poor critic is worse, thefore, unjust criticism should never ruffle the temper of its victim. The author of these pages belongs to that type of the “brave new woman who scorns to sigh,” but feels that she has something to say, and says it to the best of her ability, and leaves the verdict in the hands of the public. She give to the reader her best thoughts and leaves him to accept or reject as merit may manifest itself. No author is under contract to please her readers at all times, nor can she hope to control the sentiments of all of them at any time, therefore, the obligation is reciprocal, for the fame she receives is due to the pleasure she affords. The author of these fugitive pieces is young, just on the threshold of life, and with the daring audacity of youth makes assertions and gives decisions which she may reverse as time mellows her opinions, and the realities of life force aside the theories of youth, and prosy facts obscure the memory of that happy time when the heart overflowing with— “The joy Of young ideas painted on the mind, In the warm glowing colors Fancy spreads On objects, not yet known, when all is new, And all is lovely.” There is much in this book that is good; much that is crude; some that is poor: but all give that assurance of something great and noble when the bud of promise, now unfolding its petals in the morning glow of light, will have matured into that fuller growth of blossoming flower ere the noonday sun passes its zenith. May the hope thus engendered by this first attempt reach its fruition, and may the energy displayed by one so young meet the reward it merits from an approving public. Sylvanie F. Williams. THREE THOUGHTS. FIRST. How few of us In all the world's great, ceaseless strugling strife, Go to our work with gladsome, buoyant step, And love it for its sake, whate'er it be. Because it is a labor, or, mayhap, Some sweet, peculiar art of God's own gift; And not the promise of the world's slow smile Of recognition, or of mammon's gilded grasp. Alas, how few, in inspiration's dazzling flash, Or spiritual sense of world's beyond the dome Of circling blue around this weary earth, Can bask, and know the God-given grace Of genius' fire that flows and permeates The virgin mind alone; the soul in which The love of earth hath tainted not. The love of art and art alone. SECOND. “Who dares stand forth?” the monarch cried, “Amid the throng, and dare to give Their aid, and bid this wretch to live? I pledge my faith and crown beside, A woeful plight, a sorry sight, This outcast from all God-given grace. What, ho! in all, no friendly face, No helping hand to stay his plight? St. Peter's name be pledged for aye, The man's accursed, that is true; But ho, he suffers. None of you Will mercy show, or pity sigh?” Strong men drew back, and lordly train Did slowly file from monarch's look, Whose lips curled scorn. But from a nook A voice cried out, “Though he has slain That which I loved the best on earth, Yet will I tend him till he dies, I can be brave.” A woman's eyes Gazed fearlessly into his own. THIRD. When all the world has grown full cold to thee, And man—proud pygmy—shrugs all scornfully, And bitter, blinding tears flow gushing forth, Because of thine own sorrows and poor plight, Then turn ye swift to nature's page, And read there passions, immeasurably far Greater than thine own in all their littleness. For nature has her sorrows and her joys, As all the piled-up mountains and low vales Will silently attest—and hang thy head In dire confusion, for having dared To moan at thine own miseries When God and nature suffer silently. A PLAINT. Dear God, 'tis hard, so awful hard to lose The one we love, and see him go afar, With scarce one thought of aching hearts behind, Nor wistful eyes, nor outstretched yearning hands. Chide not, dear God, if surging thoughts arise. And bitter questionings of love and fate, But rather give my weary heart thy rest, And turn the sad, dark memories into sweet. Dear God, I fain my loved one were anear, But since thou will'st that happy thence he'll be, I send him forth, and back I'll choke the grief Rebellious rises in my lonely heart. I pray thee, God, my loved one joy to bring; I dare not hope that joy will be with me, But ah, dear God, one boon I crave of thee, That he shall ne'er forget his hours with me. IMPRESSIONS. THOUGHT. A swift, successive chain of things, That flash, kaleidoscope-like, now in, now out, Now straight, now eddying in wild rings, No order, neither law, compels their moves, But endless, constant, always swiftly roves. HOPE. Wild seas of tossing, writhing waves, A wreck half-sinking in the tortuous gloom; One man clings desperately, while Boreas raves, And helps to blot the rays of moon and star, Then comes a sudden flash of light, which gleams on shores afar. LOVE. A bed of roses, pleasing to the eye, Flowers of heaven, passionate and pure, Upon this bed the youthful often lie, And pressing hard upon its sweet delight, The cruel thorns pierce soul and heart, and cause a woeful blight. DEATH. A traveller who has always heard That on this journey he some day must go, Yet shudders now, when at the fatal word He starts upon the lonesome, dreary way, The past, a page of joy and woe,—the future, none can say. FAITH. Blind clinging to a stern, stone cross, Or it may be of frailer make; Eyes shut, ears closed to earth's drear dross, Immovable, serene, the world away From thoughts—the mind uncaring for another day. LEGEND OF THE NEWSPAPER. Poets sing and fables tell us, Or old folk lore whispers low, Of the origin of all things, Of the spring from whence they came, Kalevala, old and hoary, Æneid, Iliad, Æsop, too, All are filled with strange quaint legends, All replete with ancient tales,— How love came, and how old earth, Freed from chaos, grew for us, To a green and wondrous spheroid, To a home for things alive; How fierce fire and iron cold, How the snow and how the frost,— All these things the old rhymes ring, All these things the old tales tell. Yet they ne'er sang of the beginning, Of that great unbreathing angel, Of that soul without a haven, Of that gracious Lady Bountiful, Yet they ne'er told how it came here; Ne'er said why we read it daily, Nor did they even let us guess why We were left to tell the tale. Came one day into the wood-land, Muckintosh, the great and mighty, Muckintosh, the famous thinker, He whose brain was all his weapons, As against his rival's soarings, High unto the vaulted heavens, Low adown the swarded earth, Rolled he round his gaze all steely, And his voice like music prayed: “Oh, Creator, wondrous Spirit, Thou who hast for us descended In the guise of knowledge mighty, And our brains with truth o'er-flooded; In the greatness of thy wisdom, Knowest not our limitations? Wondrous thoughts have we, thy servants, Wondrous things we see each day, Yet we cannot tell our brethren, Yet we cannot let them know, Of our doings and our happenings, Should they parted be from us? Help us, oh, Thou Wise Creator, From the fulness of thy wisdom, Show us how to spread our knowledge, And disseminate our actions, Such as we find worthy, truly. Quick the answer came from heaven; Muckintosh, the famous thinker, Muckintosh, the great and mighty, Felt a trembling, felt a quaking, Saw the earth about him open, Saw the iron from the mountains Form a quaint and queer machine, Saw the lead from out the lead mines Roll into small lettered forms, Saw the fibres from the flax-plant, Spread into great sheets of paper, Saw the ink galls from the green trees Crushed upon the leaden forms; Muckintosh, the famous thinker, Muckintosh, the great and mighty, Felt a trembling, felt a quaking, Saw the earth about him open, Saw the flame and sulphur smoking, Came the printer's little devil, Far from distant lands the printer, Man of unions, man of cuss-words, From the depths of sooty blackness; Came the towel of the printer; Many things that Muckintosh saw,— Galleys, type, and leads and rules, Presses, press-men, quoins and spaces, Quads and caps and lower cases. But to Muckintosh bewildered, All this passed as in a dream, Till within his nervous hand, Hand with joy and fear a-quaking, Muckintosh, the great and mighty, Muckintosh, the famous thinker, Held the first of our newspapers. PAUL TO VIRGINIA. FIN DE SIECLE. I really must confess, my dear, I cannot help but love you, For of all girls I ever knew, There's none I place above you; But then you know it's rather hard, To dangle aimless at your skirt, And watch your every movement so, For I am jealous, and you're a flirt. There's half a score of fellows round, You smile at every one, And as I think to pride myself for basking in the sun Of your sweet smiles, you laugh at me, And treat me like a lump of dirt, Until I wish that I were dead, For I am jealous, and you're a flirt. I'm sorry that I've ever known Your loveliness entrancing, Or ever saw your laughing eyes, With girlish mischief dancing; 'Tis agony supreme and rare To see your slender waist a-girt With other fellows' arms, you see, For I am jealous, and you're a flirt. Now, girlie, if you'll promise me, To never, never treat me mean, I'll show you in a little while, The best sweetheart you've ever seen; You do not seem to know or care, How often you've my feelings hurt, While flying round with other boys, For I am jealous, and you're a flirt. THE MAIDEN'S DREAM. The following two poems have been extracted from a passage of prose text. [Egypt, thou knowest too well] Egypt, thou knowest too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings, And thou should'st tow me after. Over my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knewest, And that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me. [Take all of me—I am thine own, heart, soul] Take all of me—I am thine own, heart, soul, Brain, body, all; all that I am or dream Is thine forever; yea, though space should teem With thy conditions, I'd fulfil the whole, Were to fulfil them to be loved by thee. IN MEMORIAM. The light streams through the windows arched high, And o'er the stern, stone carvings breaks In warm rich gold and crimson waves, Then steals away in corners dark to die. And all the grand cathedral silence falls Into the hearts of those that worship low, Like tender waves of hushed nothingness, Confined nor kept by human earthly walls. Deep music in its thundering organ sounds, Grows diffuse through the echoing space, Till hearts grow still in sadness' mighty joy, Or leap aloft in swift ecstatic bounds. Mayhap 'twas but a dream that came to me, Or but a vision of the soul's desire, To see the nation in one mighty whole, Do homage on its bended, worshipping knee. Through time's heroic actions, the soul of man, Alone proves what that soul without earth's dross Could be, and this, through time's far-searching fire, Flath proved thine white beneath the deepest scan. A woman's tribute, 'tis a tiny dot, A merest flower from a frail, small hand, To lay among the many petaled wreaths About thy form,—a tribute soon forgot. But if in all the incense to arise In fragrance to the blue empyrean The blended sweetness of the womens' love Goes pouring too, in all their heartfelt sighs, And if one woman's sorrow be among them too, One woman's joy for labor past Be reckoned in the mighty teeming whole, It is enough, there is not more to do. Within the hearts of heroes small and great There 'bides a tenderness for weakling things Within thy heart, the sorrowing country knows These passions, bravest and the tenderest mate. When man is dust, before the gazing eyes Of all the gaping throng, his life lies wide For all to see and whisper low about Or let their thoughts in discord's clatter rise. But thine was pure and undefiled, A record of long brilliant, teeming days, Each thought did tend to further things, But pure as the proverbial child. Oh, people, that thy grief might find express To gather in some vast cathedral's hall, That then in unity we might kneel and hear Sublimity in sounds, voice our distress. Peace, peace, the men of God cry, ye be bold, The world hath known, 'tis Heaven who claims him now, And in our railings we but cast aside The noble traits he bid us hold. So though divided through the land, in dreams We see a people kneeling low, Bowed down in heart and soul to see This fearful sorrow, crushing as it seems. And all the grand cathedral silence falls Into the hearts of these that worship low, Like tender waves of hushed nothingness, Confined, nor kept by human earthly walls. AT BAY ST. LOUIS. Soft breezes blow and swiftly show Through fragrant orange branches parted, A maiden fair, with sun-flecked hair, Caressed by arrows, golden darted. The vine-clad tree holds forth to me A promise sweet of purple blooms, And chirping bird, scarce seen but heard Sings dreamily, and sweetly croons At Bay St. Louis. The hammock swinging, idly singing, Lissome nut-brown maid Swings gaily, freely, to-and-fro; The curling, green-white waters casting cool, clear shade, Rock small, shell boats that go In circles wide, or tug at anchor's chain, As though to skim the sea with cargo vain, At Bay St. Louis. The maid swings slower, slower to-and-fro, And sunbeams kiss gray, dreamy half-closed eyes; Fond lover creeping on with foot steps slow, Gives gentle kiss, and smiles at sweet surpise. The lengthening shadows tell that eve is nigh, And fragrant zephyrs cool and calmer grow, Yet still the lover lingers, and scarce breathed sigh, Bids the swift hours to pause, nor go, At Bay St. Louis. NEW YEAR'S DAY. The poor old year died hard; for all the earth lay cold And bare beneath the wintry sky; While grey clouds scurried madly to the west, And hid the chill young moon from mortal sight. Deep, dying groans the aged year breathed forth, In soughing winds that wailed a requiem sad In dull crescendo through the mournful air. The new year now is welcomed noisily With din and song and shout and clanging bell, And all the glare and blare of fiery fun. Sing high the welcome to the New Year's morn! Le roi est mort. Vive, vive le roi! cry out, And hail the new-born king of coming days. Alas! the day is spent and eve draws nigh; The king's first subject dies—for naught, And wasted moments by the hundred score Of past years rise like spectres grim To warn, that these days may not idly glide away. Oh, New Year, youth of promise fair! What dost thou hold for me? An aching heart? Or eyes burnt blind by unshed tears? Or stabs, More keen because unseen? Nay, nay, dear youth, I've had surfeit Of sorrow's feast. The monarch dead Did rule me with an iron hand. Be thou a friend, A tender, loving king—and let me know The ripe, full sweetness of a happy year. FAREWELL. Farewell, sweetheart, and again farewell; To-day we part, and who can tell If we shall e'er again Meet, and with clasped hands Renew our vows of love, and forget The sad, dull pain. Dear heart, 'tis bitter thus to lose thee And think mayhap, you will forget me; And yet, I thrill As I remember long and happy days Fraught with sweet love and pleasant memories That linger still You go to loved ones who will smile And clasp you in their arms, and all the while I stay and moan For you, my love, my heart and strive To gather up life's dull, gray thread And walk alone. Aye, with you love the red and gold Goes from my life, and leaves it cold And dull and bare, Why should I strive to live and learn And smile and jest, and daily try You from my heart to tare? Nay, sweetheart, rather would I lie Me down, and sleep for aye; or fly To regions far Where cruel Fate is not and lovers live Nor feel the grim, cold hand of Destiny Their way to bar. I murmur not, dear love, I only say Again farewell. God bless the day On which we met, And bless you too, my love, and be with you In sorrow or in happiness, nor let you E'er me forget. IF I HAD KNOWN. If I had known Two years ago how drear this life should be, And crowd upon itself allstrangely sad, Mayhap another song would burst from out my lips, Overflowing with the happiness of future hopes; Mayhap another throb than that of joy, Have stirred my soul into its inmost depths, If I had known. If I had known, Two years ago the impotence of love, The vainness of a kiss, how barren a caress, Mayhap my soul to higher things have soarn, Nor clung to earthly loves and tender dreams, But ever up aloft into the blue empyrean, And there to master all the world of mind, If I had known. CHALMETLE. Wreaths of lilies and immortelles, Scattered upon each silent mound, Voices in loving remembrance swell, Chanting to heaven the solemn sound. Glad skies above, and glad earth beneath; And grateful hearts who silently Gather earth's flowers, and tenderly wreath Woman's sweet token of fragility. Ah, the noble forms who fought so well Lie, some unnamed, 'neath the grassy mound; Heroes, brave heroes, the stories tell, Silently too, the unmarked mounds, Tenderly wreath them about with flowers, Joyously pour out your praises loud; For every joy beat in these hearts of ours Is only a drawing us nearer to God. Little enough is the song we sing, Little enough is the tale we tell, When we think of the voices who erst did ring Ere their owners in smoke of battle fell. Little enough are the flowers we cull To scatter afar on the grass-grown graves, When we think of bright eyes, now dimmed and dull For the cause they loyally strove to save. And they fought right well, did these brave men, For their banner still floats unto the breeze, And the pæans of ages forever shall tell Their glorious tale beyond the seas. Ring out your voices in praises loud, Sing sweet your notes of music gay, Tell me in all you loyal crowd Throbs there a heart unmoved to-day? Meeting together again this year, As met we in fealty and love before; Men, maids, and matrons to reverent'y hear Praises of brave men who fought of yore. Tell to the little ones with wondering eyes, The tale of the flag that floats so free; Till their tiny voices shall merrily rise In hymns of rejoicing and praises to Thee. Many a pure and noble heart Lies under the sod, all covered with green; Many a soul that had felt the smart Of life's sad torture, or mayhap had seen The faint hope of love pass afar from the sight, Like swift flight of bird to a rarer clime Many a youth whose death caused the blight Of tender hearts in that long, sad time. Nay, but this is no hour for sorrow; They died at their duty, shall we repine? Let us gaze hopefully on to the morrow Praying that our lives thus shall shine. Ring out your bugles, sound out your cheers! Man has been God-like so may we be. Give cheering thanks, there dry up those tears, Widowed and orphaned, the country is free! Wreathes of lillies and immortelles, Scattered upon each silent mound, Voices in loving remembrance swell, Chanting to heaven the solemn sound, Glad skies above, and glad earth beneath, And grateful hearts who silently Gather earth's flowers, and tenderly wreath Woman's sweet token of fragility. THE IDLER. An idle lingerer on the wayside's road, He gathers up his work and yawns away; A little longer, ere the tiresome load Shall be reduced to ashes or to clay. No matter if the world has marched along, And scorned his slowness as it quickly passed; No matter, if amid the busy throng, He greets some face, infantile at the last. His mission? Well, there is but one, And if it is a mission he knows it, nay, To be a happy idler, to lounge and sun, And dreaming, pass his long-drawn days away. So dreams he on, his happy life to pass Content, without ambitions painful sighs, Until the sands run down into the glass; He smiles—content—unmoved and and dies And yet, with all the pity that you feel For this poor mothling of that flame, the world; Are you the better for your desperate deal, When you, like him, into infinitude are hurled? LOVE AND THE BUTTERFLY. I heard a merry voice one day And glancing at my side, Fair Love, all breathless, flushed with play, A butterfly did ride “Whither away, oh sportive boy?” I asked, he tossed his head; Laughing aloud for purest joy, And past me swiftly sped. Next day I heard a plaintive cry And Love crept in my arms; Weeping he held the butterfly, Devoid of all its charms. Sweet words of comfort, whispered I Into his dainty ears, But love still hugged the butterfly, And bathed its wounds with tears. AMID THE ROSES. There is tropical warmth and languerous life Where the roses lie In a tempting drift Of pink and red and golden light Untouched as yet by the pruning knife. And the still, warm life of the roses fair That whisper “Come,” With promises Of sweet caresses, close and pure Has a thorny whiff in the perfumed air. There are thorns and love in the roses' bed, And Satan too Must linger there; So Satan's wiles and the conscience stings, Must now abide—the roses are dead.</field>
