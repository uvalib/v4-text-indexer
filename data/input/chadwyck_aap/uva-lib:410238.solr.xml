Dedication to the BAPTIST BELIEVERS IN CHRIST JESUS, of america, who are strangers and pilgrims on the earth, as all our fathers were, I, THIS, the fourteenth day of november, A. D. Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Seven, Dedicate this Book, the first volume of my sermons, with praise and thanksgiving, to GOD. C. B. W. G. [I, a humble servant of the Lord] PREFACE. I, a humble servant of the Lord, Having been requested again and again, By numbers of people young and old, To publish my sermons for the good of their friends. Do now consent to their wishes, And give unto men such as I have, That all may read both saint and sinner, And be directed to the heavenly path. Trusting that those who may chance here to read, Will not search for the rhetorical phrase, For such I have not to give, But rather for truth and give God the praise. If theologians should herein read, Who can better than I make plain the way, I trust they'll not read behind the dark skeptical veil But take their vision in the clear noonday. If the humble soul in search of light Would here be aided on the heavenly march, And be better enabled to bear his cross, He must seek the truth with a pure heart. With earnest prayer to our Heavenly Father To bless the truth herein contained, I conclude my preface with this saying, Lord, let not my labors be in vain. Chas. B. W. Gordon. Parsonage, 141 Harrison St., Petersburg, Va. Nov. 14, 1887. INTRODUCTORY SKETCH. An Extract from the Volume of Poems entitled âThe Good Shepherd.â HELP THE HEATHEN. There is a land of grief and woe, A land far across the ocean wave, Where heathen nations know not God, Nor seek to find the blessed way. This is the way the nations have gone, Since in darkness they were born; The way of God they have not known, They bow to idols of wood and stone. They walk in darkness with great delight, They seek the road to keen despair; Thousands are travelling without the light, Thousands have made their journey there. It was for them that Jesus died, But His name they have not known; The Shepherd here has given the 'larm, But unto them he has not gone. The voice of God is calling now, For soldiers strong and bold; To carry the gospel to them there, That Jesus' name there may be told. Oh, that we could hear some one say, âLord here am I, send me! I'll take the gospel and carry it there, That they may know salvation's free.â If you cannot go, you can give your means, To help to send the gospel there; That the heathen may know the name of God, And for judgment day make some prepare. If you cannot give the rich man's sum, You can give a penny or a shilling; If you cannot pay the preacher's full fare, You can show to the Lord that you're willing. [If you would be noble] If you would be noble, Work and toil to make the way; If you would be happy, Seek to find the brighter day. Though your way be dark and dreary, And your heart be sick with fear. Never stop in clouds to wonder, Though you have to shed a tear. [Then will the glad sound be heard] Then will the glad sound be heard All over the land, From pole to pole! The lion and the lamb together lie; And all are led by a little child's hand. âFinally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things.â THE SCIENCE OF SPIRITUAL LIGHT. [âAnd when we have been there ten thousand years] âAnd when we have been there ten thousand years, Bright, shining as the sun, We have no less bright illustrious days, Than when we first begun.â ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE. [âA pilgrim through this lonely world] âA pilgrim through this lonely world, The blessed Saviour passed; A mourner all his life was he, A dying lamb at last.â [âIn all my Lord's appointed ways] âIn all my Lord's appointed ways My journey I'll pursue; Hinder me not, ye much-loved saints, For I must go with you. âThrough floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I'll follow where he goes; Hinder me not shall be my cry, Though earth and hell oppose.â JESUS TALKING BY THE WAY. [âThrough floods and flames if Jesus leads] âThrough floods and flames if Jesus leads I'll follow where he goes; Hinder me not, shall be my cry, Though earth and hell oppose.â THE SOLEMN WARNING. [The King of kings has so decreed] The King of kings has so decreed That the rich and poor together must go; His power is great, his throne is high, And none can escape his watchful eye. PRAYER AND ITS EFFECTS. [âPrayer is the breath of God in man] âPrayer is the breath of God in man, Returning whence it came; Love is the sacred fire within, And prayer the rising flame. âIt gives the burdened spirit ease, And soothes the troubled breast; Yields comfort to the mourners here, And to the weary rest.â [âMy soul, be on thy guard] âMy soul, be on thy guard; Ten thousand foes arise; The hosts of sin are pressing hard To draw thee from the skies. âOh, watch and fight and pray; The battle ne'er giver o'er; Renew it boldly every day, And help divine implore. âNe'er think the victory won, Nor lay thine armor down; Thy arduous work will not be done Till thou obtain thy crown.â [âPrayer is the contrite sinner's voice] âPrayer is the contrite sinner's voice Returning from his ways, While angels in their songs rejoice, And cry, Behold, he prays. âPrayer is the Christian's vital breath, The Christian's native air, His watchword at the gates of death; He enters heaven with prayer.â THE WHEAT AND THE TARES. [He chills the mortal frame] He chills the mortal frame, And takes the breath away; And if the soul is not prepared His travel is to shame. For to the bar the man must go, And stand before his God, To give a true and accurate account For all his doings below. [Oh! what will be the hypocrite's plea] Oh! what will be the hypocrite's plea When in judgment he shall stand, And find himself on sinking sand And no mercy he can see? Oh! where will be the sinner's stay, When judgment calls him to the bar; To see the Judge with glory crowned And hear him cry âSinner go away.â FOR OR AGAINST. [âThat awful day will surely come] âThat awful day will surely come, Th' appointed hour makes haste, When I must stand before my Judge, And pass the solemn test. âThou lovely Chief of all my joys, Thou Sovereign of my heart, How could I bear to hear thy voice Pronounce the sound, Depart!â OUR GOD AND THE FIERY FURNACE. [âOh, for a faith that will not shrink] âOh, for a faith that will not shrink, Though pressed by every foe; That will not tremble on the brink Of any earthly woe.â THE TREE OF LIFE. [âMy faith would lay her hand] âMy faith would lay her hand On that dear head of thine, While like a penitent I stand, And there confess my sins.â [âMust I be carried to the skies] âMust I be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease, While others fought to win the prize, And sailed through bloody seas! âSure I must fight, if would reign; Increase my courage, Lord; I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, Supported by thy word.â [âWhen we have been there ten thousand years] âWhen we have been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We have no less day to sing God's praise Than when we first begun.â THE FIRST COMMANDMENT. [âJesus my all to heaven is gone] âJesus my all to heaven is gone, He whom I fix my hopes upon; His track I see, and I'll pursue The narrow way till him I view. The way the holy prophets went; The road that leads from banishment: The King's high way of holiness, I'll go, for all his paths are peace.â CHRIST, THE LAW FULFILLING. [âNot all the blood of beasts] âNot all the blood of beasts, On Jewish altars slain, Could give the guilty conscience peace, Or wash away the stain. âBut Christ, the heavenly Lamb, Takes all our sins away,â A sacrifice of nobler name, And richer blood than they.â [He died the just for the unjust] He died the just for the unjust That we, poor sinners, might have rest; The claims of the law he fully met And opened the door that had been shut. GOD WRESTLING WITH THE SINNER. [âJesus I come to thee] âJesus I come to thee, A sinner doomed to die; My only refuge is thy cross, Here at thy feet I lie.â TRANSGRESSION ACKNOWLEDGED. [âOh that I knew the secret place] âOh that I knew the secret place Where I might find my God! I'd spread my wants before his face, And pour my woes abroad.â INTERCESSION FOR TRANSGRESSORS. [âWhile all our hearts and every song] âWhile all our hearts and every song, Join to admire the feast, Each of us cries, with thankful tongue, Lord, why was I a guest?â While we stand in wonder the poet gives answer. â'Twas the same love that spread the feast, That sweetly forced us in; Else we had still refused to taste, And perished in our sins.â FAITH. [âHis purposes will ripen fast] âHis purposes will ripen fast, Unfolding every hour; The bud may have a bitter taste, But sweet will be the flower.â [âFaith is a living power from heaven] âFaith is a living power from heaven, Which grasps the promise God has given; A trust that cannot be o'erthrown Securely fixed on Christ alone.â EVIL WORKS. [âMoves in a mysterious way] âMoves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform; And plants his footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm,â SPIRITUAL OFFENSES. [âHow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord] âHow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in his excellent word! What more can he say than to you he hath said, You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?â [âOh for a faith that will not shrink] âOh for a faith that will not shrink, Though pressed by every foe, That will not tremble on the brink Of any earthly woe.â [âThou dying Lamb, thy precious blood] âThou dying Lamb, thy precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till all the ransomed Church of God, Be saved to sin no more.â CONGREGATION OF THE DEAD. [Oh, sinner, cease to wander] Oh, sinner, cease to wander, And to Jesus turn and live; Seek him while he may be found, Eternal life is his to give. [Oh, sinner, doubt not the God of peace] Oh, sinner, doubt not the God of peace, For he who doubts is sure to err, From the path of truth, And in wisdom has no share. SPIRITUAL GROWTH. [âMust Jesus bear the cross alone] âMust Jesus bear the cross alone, And all the world go free? No: there's a cross for every one, And there's a cross for me.â STANDING FAST IN BAPTIST FAITH. [âOh, speed thee, Christian, on thy way] âOh, speed thee, Christian, on thy way, And to thy armor cling; With girded loins the call obey That grace and mercy bring.â [âJesus shall reign where'er the sun] âJesus shall reign where'er the sun, Does his successive journey run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, Till moons shall wax and wane no more.â [âWhen we've been there ten thousand years] âWhen we've been there ten thousand years, Bright, shining as the sun We've no less days to sing God's praise, Than when we first begun.â THE GOOD CONFESSION. [âLet worldly minds the world pursue] âLet worldly minds the world pursue; It has no charms for me; Once I admired its trifles, too, But grace has set me free. âDeny thyself and take thy cross, Is the Redeemer's great command; Nature must count her gold but dross, If she would gain the heavenly land.â THE WATERS OF MARAH. [âThe Lord can clear the darkest skies] âThe Lord can clear the darkest skies, And give us day for night: Make drops of sacred sorrow rise To rivers of delight.â Then, in the midst of tribulations and distresses, let us sing: âArise my soul from deep distress, And banish every fear; He calls thee to his throne of grace To spread thy sorrows there.â THE PHILOSOPHY OF MAN'S EXISTENCE. [He brings new lustre again and again to our sight] He brings new lustre again and again to our sight, And carries our souls away into oceans of delight. THE FUTURE HOPE OF THE NEGRO. [âJesus, I my cross have taken] âJesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave, and follow thee; Naked, poor, despised, forsaken, Thou from hence my all shall be.â [âHow can I sink with such a prop] âHow can I sink with such a prop As my eternal God; Who bears the earth's huge pillars up, And spreads the heavens abroad?â [âJesus shall reign where'er the sun] âJesus shall reign where'er the sun Does his successive journeys run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore Till moons shall wax and wane no more.â INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. [Be not disturbed ye saints of the Lord] Be not disturbed ye saints of the Lord, God will sustain us if we trust in his word. [Popularity, notoriety and fame] Popularity, notoriety and fame, But is sooner lost in shame. [âHaste, O sinner; now be wise] âHaste, O sinner; now be wise; Stay not for the morrow's sun; Wisdom if you still despise, Harder is it to be won.â TRUTH REVEALED AND SIN EXPOSED. [If the truth had never been known] If the truth had never been known, He would have never been shown. [âHow art thou fallen from heaven] âHow art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground That didst weaken the nation!â GOD DWELLING WITH ISRAEL. [How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord] How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in his excellent word! What more can he say than to you he hath said, You who unto Jesus for refuge hath fled?â COMING OUT FROM AMONG THE WICKED. [âHaste, O sinner; now be wise] âHaste, O sinner; now be wise; Stay not for the morrow's sun; Wisdom if you still despise, Harder is it to be won.â [âOh, for a closer walk with God] âOh, for a closer walk with God, A calm and heavenly frame, A light to shine upon the road That leads me to the Lamb.â THE DIVINE COMMISSION. [To the church the charge is given] To the church the charge is given, To spread the gospel rays, That sinners perishing in despair, May seek the Savior's grace.
