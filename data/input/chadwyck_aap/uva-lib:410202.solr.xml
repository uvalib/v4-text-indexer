      <field name="fulltext">TO THE NEGRO OF THE OLD REGIME, CONFIDING, LOYAL, PICTURESQUE, I DEDICATE IN LOVING THOUGHT OF THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF HIS DAYS THIS LITTLE VOLUME OF VERSE. MAY THE JOY AND PATHOS OF HIS SONG BE A RICH INHERITANCE AMONG MEN!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The evolution of the Negro is fast destroying the unique types of the race. Another quarter of a century of freedom and the Negro of slavery days, the Negro of the log cabin and the corn field will be but cherished memories. To those who have known the solicitous care of a “black mammy” and listened to the homely philosophy and quaint humor of the plantation darkey there is a touch of pathos in the transformation they are undergoing, relieved by a feeling of pride and pleasure in their progression. In his anti-bellum state the Negro was close to nature. He gave a language to the birds and beasts, and his simplicity and superstition formed the basis for a charming fiction. Melody sprang spontaneously within him, and his gravest utterances were gilded with the quaintest humor. American literature has preserved few of these types. The efforts of the majority of writers to portray them have been failures. The author of this volume has caught the true spirit of the anti-bellum Negro, and in characteristic verse has portrayed the simplicity, the philosophy and the humor of the race. In no instance has he descended to caricature, which has made valueless so many efforts in this fertile field of literary effort. These poems will awaken tender memories in all who have dwelt in the Southland; they will be an inspiration to the musician in adding to the melodies peculiar to the plantation black, for all of them are adapted to musical interpretation. To the captious critic who may be inclined to find fault with the varying dialect, the following incident will be valuable: A member of a minstrel company who desired to thoroughly master the Negro dialect associated for months with the Negroes on a Virginia plantation. When he appeared upon the stage in Richmond, he made an instantaneous success. Later on, he appeared in Georgia and Alabama, and no one understood him. There are other than dialect poems in this volume, and they show a fine feeling and are of a high order of expression. I regard “Echoes from the Cabin” as a valuable contribution to American literature. The Negro dialect poems have not been equalled for fidelity to character since the Suwanee River was written.

UNCLE EPH— EPICURE. You kin talk erbout yo' 'lasses an' yo' steamin' buckwheat cakes, 'Bout yo' eisters fried in crackers, an' yo' juicy hot clambakes; 'Bout yo' beefsteak fried wid inguns, an' yo' ros'n yeahs ob co'n, But ol' possum wid sweet taters beats dem all, des sho's you bo'n. Tek erway yo' Floyda eiange, tek erway yo' fig and date, An' bring erlong my 'possum on dat bigges' ol' tin plate. Turnip greens all biled wid bacon an' er co'n pone smokin hot, I gwi' nebber scratch dat ticket caze it retch ur tender spot. An' hot biscuits wid hot coffee mek ur mighty han'som pa'r, W'ile ol' hen biled wid dumplin's, O yes, dat's parsin' fa'r. But tek erway yo' greens an' bacon, tek erway yo' chicken biled, An' bring 'possum an' sweet taters—hesh yo' mouf, dey sets me wild! Sta't him out'n pawpaw thicket, chase him up er 'simmon tree, W'ile de music ob dat houn' pack sets de woods er-ring wid glee. Roun' de hill an' troo de bottom, up de holler by de spring, Ow! ow! ow! ow! des a whoopin'! how dat ol' lead-houn' do sing! An' you hurry troo de briahs an' you tumble ober logs, Nebber knowin', nebber cyarin' ez you chyuh dem blessed dogs. An' w'en dey all sees you comin', how dem dogs sing wid new grace, Fum de young houn's sweet, cla'r tenah ter de ol' houn's mighty bass. An' dar on ur lim' er grinnin' wid his tail quoiled mighty tight, Hangs my fren', ol' Mistah 'Possum—how dem dogs howl wid delight. An' you crawl out furder, furder, twel you hyuh dat ol' lim' crack, An' you shake er loose his tail holt, an' you put him in yo' sack. Den you tote him home an' feed him twel he fat des ez you please, Den you kill him an' you hang him out er frosty night ter freeze. Den you stuff him wid sweet taters an 'put butter all ur roun', Den you put him in de oven an' you bake him twel he's brown. Oom! all swimmin' in his graby an' ur drippin' in his fat— Talk erbout yo' milk an' honey, wut's de hebbenly food ter dat? Let dat show-ban' play its loudes', let dat 'cession des march on, I wouldn't stop my eatin' ef ol' Gab'ul blowed his horn! UNCLE EPH'S HORSE TRADE. [Aunt Susan sends Uncle Eph to town to sell the cow. Meeting Farmer Johnson with a dun mule, he makes a trade.] UNCLE EPH. “Come out hyuh, Thomas 'Rastus, an' see wut Daddy got— Woa dar, you long yurd debbil, yo' legs too full ur trot! Git out de way, you chillun, he mighty full ur fiah, His mammy was ur Mo'gan, ur jackass wus his siah. Stop dat you Gineral Jackson! (De Voodoo's in dis mule!) Say, chillun, whar yo' mammy? (I spec' I been ur fool.”) Ob cose he summat spavin' an' stone blin' in one eye, An' his ha'r all off in places—dat come all right bimeby. (Fo' de Lawd, dar Susan—now how I gwine ter 'splain Urbout dis debblish hoss trade—hit gwine go 'ginst de grain.) Des look ur hyuh, 'ol' 'oman, I'se traded off de cow; You bet I med ur bawgin, an' dat youse boun' ter 'low. De cow was mighty scrawny an' den she mos' wuz dry; De price ur hay am raisin'—dar's no green in my eye. I met ol' Fa'mah Johnsing ur ridin' in ter town, I 'sarbed dis mule's fine action an' axed de gempmun down. I led him foruds, backuds—his action mighty free, His mouf I zaminated—his age des tirty-tree. An' den I mek ur offah—de cow fur Johnsing's mule, He cussed urroun' ur little—I nebber wuz ur fool. So Johnsing dribe de cow off, ur wa'kin' doan' you see, While I come home ur ridin' ez big ez big kin be. Des watch him trot, ol' 'oman, dat motion's Mo'gan true— Fine blood gwine tell in muleses ez well ez hosses, too. I needs him fur de plowin' w'en gyardenin' time come 'roun', My back done got rheumatics an' I cyawn' spade de groun.” SUSAN. “You call dem bones ur hoss trade? You allus wuz ur' fool! Tuck my cow an' traded fur ur knock-kneed spavin' mule! Dat blood do tell in muleses; hit tells in niggahs mo'— De Browns wuz allus triflin', an' Efum, youse mo' so. I wucked ha'd all lars' summah, w'en you wuz loafin' roun' Spen'in' yo' lars' nickel in dem dram shops in de town, Ur sweatin' and ur gruntin' in dat ol' washin' tub Ter buy dat Jussey heffah an' keep you all in grub. Des come ur little closah, you triflin' lim' ob Ham! Oom, hoo! I smell de liquah. I knowed you hed er dram. You long-legged tu'key trottin', black, good fur nothin' fool— Ur tradin' off my heffah fur yo' match—ur spavin' mule! Ef I des hed hot watah, I'd scal' you bofe, I 'clar, You ring bone, knoc-kneed, triflin', ol' saddle-culled pa'r! Des clam back in dat saddle an' fo' dat sun go down, You hunts up ol' man Johnsing ez sho's yo name am Brown, An' gits dat Jussey heffah—I doan' cyah how hits done; You tu'ns her in dat back ya'd urfo' de risin' sun!” And Ephraim and the dun mule of Morgan blood descent, Went galloping down the red road for Farmer Johnson's bent. At five o'clock next morning when the Shanghai rooster crowed, The yellow Jersey heifer in Susan's back yard lowed. DE 'SPRISE PA'TY.

An' wen de Reb'ren' Pa'son prayed 'bout ur “sheep wuz los'.” An' 'bout de “po bac'slidah,” she gin her head ur toss!

De “Debbil's Dream” come arter—de debbil wuz ter pay, Dem niggahs fell ter pattin'—I larf mos' ebbry day! Deacon Jones got on his feet, de pa'son pulled him down; I played ur little fastah, an' sho's my name am Brown, De pa'son an' de deacons jined han's right on dis flo', Su'cled right and su'cled lef'—it sutny wuz er show.

An' we'n urfo' de meetin' dat 'mittee med its 'po't 'Bout Sistah Susan's dawncin', dey cut it mighty sho't. De chyuhsman, Mr. Pa'son, said in tones so mil' an' sweet: “Sistah Brown wa'n't guilty, caze—she nebber crossed her feet!” “LINKUM.” You axin' sah 'bout Linkum—w'y sho'ly youse been tol' 'Bout my po' chil—Gawd bless him—he died when ten yeahs ol'.

Fur chile kin be ur gempman ez well ez folks dat's grown, An' hit was so wid Linkum, hit des bred in de bone. Yit spite ob all his goodness he wa'n' no stupid chile— He 'roun de house ur singin' an' whis'lin all de w'ile. An' saiks how he could whis'le!

Her husban' he de doctah, an' mighty fine dey say; Dey on'y hab one baby—dey call her Helen Fay; Dey t'ink so much de baby—ob co'se, de on'y chile; She pu'ty ez ur picchah—her eyes des full ob smile. She all time foll'n Linkum, des ebberywhar he go, De chile des lub de po' chile—yes sah, dat sutny so. One day her mammy leab her, ur sleepin' fars' an' soun', An' in de cyar ob Linkum, while she wen' vis'tin' 'roun'. W'ile Linkum sottin' watchin' de baby sleepin' fars' He hyu'd de sweetes' music—Ur ban' wus ma'chin' pars'.

De chile furgot de baby an' wo't Mis' Bradley said, He crazy wid dat music ur playin' in his head. So out de do' wen' Linkum lak wings wuz on his feet— Lak race hoss on de home stretch ur flyin' down de street. Gawd knows he couldn' holp it—de music set him wil'; Hit allus so wid Linkum—he des de stranges' chile. De fiah bells wuz janglin', de crowd wus rushin' roun', De smoke hed filled de sta'rway—hit druv de bes' man down. De women all wuz screamin', an' men ur shoutin' loud, W'en lak ur flash ob lightnin' ur boy to' froo de crowd. Right up de blazin' sta'rway; right froo de smoke an' flame, Arter dat sleepin' baby—He put dem men ter shame!

Des come urlong, my honey chile an' sot down on my knee, An' Unker Eph 'll tell you ob de Baid-Bug an' de Flea. Dese gempmen wen' ur co'tin' ob de sweet Miss Lady-Bug; She lib at num'mer fo'ty in ur flat quite neat an' snug. Marse Baid-Bug wo' his crimson ves', his beaver, how hit shine! De ladies at de winders smiled ez he parsed down de line. Marse Flea, he wo' ur swaller-tail ob orful stylish gray; He med Miss 'Skeeter's h'a't beat fas' whar libbed ur cross de way. She envied sweet Miss Lady-Bug huh comperny so gran'— She des de meanes' dried ol' maid an' ugly, sabe de lan'! Marse Baid-Bug retch de reserdence an' “ting” he ring de bell, An' out dar come Miss Lady-Bug, hit gin him quite ur spell. He put his han' urpon his h'a't an' bowed so orful low, Dat des ur leetle furder an' his nose 'ood tech de flo.' She bowed him in de pa'lah fine an' took his hat an' cane; Dat she wuz 'joiced ter see him, O, she showed it mighty plain. He hemmed an' hawed ur leetle an' den he cross his laigs, Wen “tingle” wen' de bell urgin an' knocked him off his paigs. De do' wuz flung wide open by de butlah, Mistah Gnat, An' in dar strutted Mistah Flea ur twirlin' ob his hat. Marse Baid-Bug looked at Mistah Flea an' hate wuz in his eye, W'ile Flea looked at Miss Lady-Bug ez dough he gwine ter die. Dey sot an' sot an' looked an' looked an' neider one 'ood go; Miss Lady-Bug she sot ur tween an' gawrped, des sorter so. An' still dey sot an' sot an' stared wid eyes des full ob hate, 'Twel Missis Bug called down de sta'rs: “My deah, hits growin' late.” Dey grabbed dey hats an' grabbed dey canes an' out de do' dey went; At five ur clock dat mawnin' Mistah Flea ur chellenge sent.

Dey met at fo' dat eb'nin' sha'p down hyuh in Fire-Bug Lane, Now Mistah Flea goes on ur Crutch an' Baid-Bug on ur cane. An' Lady-Bug?

Dey fit at fo' dat eb'nin' sha'p; at five de papah's tol' How Lady Bug hed runned urway wid Captain Cock-Roach bol'! MOBILE-BUCK. The above is an attempt to catch the shuffling, jerky rhythm of the famous negro dance, the Mobile-Buck. The author has watched by the hour the negro roustabouts of Ohio and Mississippi river steamboats “buck” against each other, to use their own expression. One roustabout called on by the crew steps out and begins the shuffle. Suddenly he makes a tremendous slide forward on one foot, like the swift stroke of a skater, while with the other foot he beats a perfect tattoo. Each dancer in succession tries to outdo his predecessor, while all are cheered on by the comments and laughter of their rude but picturesque audience. —Author. O, come erlong, come erlong, Wut's de use er hol'in' back; O, hit it strong, er hit it strong, Mek de ol' flo' ben' an' crack. O, hoop tee doo, uh, hoop tee doo! Dat's de way ter knock it froo.

I knowed dem niggahs spen'in' de quarters an' de dimes Dey raise at cake-walks, fes'buls, dem fan-drills an' sich times; Fur wen ur man am hongry he hab no fuchah plan; Hit allus so, from Esau cla'r down ter Brudder Mann.

I am tired of all this sollum white, Bare boughs an' tongueless brook; The Airth is like a shrouded corpse No matter whur I look. O, I want to see the robins An' hear the bluebirds sing, An' in the pon' below the barn The bullfrog swear its Spring! I want to see white turn to brown, An' then the brown turn green, The hillsides put their mournin' off As fifty times I've seen. O, I want to hear that tongue-tied brook Go singin' on its way, Ashoutin' as it runs along: “The robins 've come to stay!” WHEN OL' SIS' JUDY PRAY.

      <field name="fulltext">ELSEWHERE. BOHEMIAN UPS AND DOWNS. Way up in a garret high, Just a few feet from the sky, Dwell I in Bohemia. What care I for aught below? There have I nor friend nor foe; Pity I the struggling throng While I live my life of song Up here in Bohemia. 'Tween my teeth my briar root— Best of friends, since always mute— Rare thing in Bohemia. Upward as the thick smoke curls What care I for simp'ring girls? Love is weak; my pipe is strong, Why for love, then, be the song Sung here in Bohemia? Oft my little songs fall flat, Hungry? What care I for that, Fasting in Bohemia? Put my only coat in pawn, Live on that and still sing on; Puff my pipe and think I've dined— Barmecidal feasts I find Often in Bohemia. Haply, then, my rhymelets take, With a check my fast to break, Feast we in Bohemia. 'Round the corner of the block, Sign o'erhead a crowing cock, Mug of beer and sandwich fine; What care we how nabobs dine, Feasting in Bohemia. Friends have I, some three or four— Quite enough, for who has more, In or out Bohemia? With them joy is always young, Grief is but a song that's sung; Live we, laugh we debonair, Skies are bright and winds are fair Always in Bohemia! SOME DAY LAND. Man never is, but always to be blessed. —Alexander Pope. O, mystic Land of Some Day, For thee our sails are spread; Thy mountains blue are looming Above us just ahead; “Land ho!” the lookout's calling, Down oars and sails are falling, The land is just ahead! O, ever just before us Dim, hazy lies thy shore; We see the breakers rolling, We catch the mad surf's roar— Yet vain the helmsman's steering, Despite our hoping, fearing— Forever, just ahead! We know, O Land of Some Day, That on thy sun-kissed heights Embodied dreams await us That filled the long, long nights; That face to face beholding, With eager arms enfolding, These visions we shall clasp. We know in halls of marble Play fountains icy cold; On walls of alabaster Hang pictures framed in gold; That thro' the night time calling, The bulbul's notes are falling Upon the ravished ear. We know through thy deep valleys The purest streamlets flow; That on thy southern hillsides The purplest vine-yards glow; That in thy gold meads reaping, The fairest maids are sweeping Their sickles 'round the grain. Yet never any nearer Our vessel comes to land, Though by the prow awaiting, Right eagerly we stand; Though winds blow never failing, Still ever on we're sailing To thee, O, Some Day Land! O, mystic Land of Some Day, Behold our sails spread wide, As toward thy azure mountains 'Neath softest skies we glide; “Land ho!” the lookout's calling, Down oars and sails are falling— Forever, just ahead! WHEN THE FRUIT TREES BLOOM. When the fruit trees bloom, Pink of peach and white of plum, And the pear-trees' cones of snow In the old back orchard blow— Planted fifty years ago! And the cherries' long white row Gives the sweetest prophecy Of the banquet that will be, When the suns and winds of June Shall have kissed to fruit the bloom— Then Falstaffian bumble-bees Drain the blossoms to the lees. When the fruit trees bloom. When the fruit trees bloom, Pink the apple, white the plum, Underneath the knotted boughs I am holding full carouse; Drunken with the wine that drips Downward from each blossom's lips, While the catbird's strident calls Seem the laugh of bacchanals Ringing through these winy halls; Serenaded by the bees, Lullabies in minor keys, Soon I sink in drunken drowse, When-the-fruit-trees-bloom. O, SWEETHEART, SWEET. O, sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago, Maid of the blue, blue eyes; You went one day like a Spring-time snow And you left me here, ah, long ago, To dream of you there in Paradise, My sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago. O, sweetheart, sweet, so long are the years, Filled with a sad, sad pain; There's little of laughter, much of tears, So weak are hopes, so strong are the fears, So much of loss, so little of gain In the harvest of all the years! But through my pain and thro' all my tears One thing, sweetheart, I know: When done with all the long, dreary years, And shed the last of Life's bitter tears, I shall find you, my sweetheart, I know. Then shall I forget all the toilful years And drown in the sea of love my fears, My sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago! SATURDAY NIGHT AT HEINRICH'S. Heinrich, bring us three bottles of wine— What shall it be, boys? Sherry or port? Cheers for old Bacchus, god of the vine, Jolly old rounder, the Greeks report. Sherry, sherry, bring us sherry, Fill the glasses, don't be chary. Bolt the door on frowning care, Draw the cork and tilt your chair; Drink and sing the night away— Day for work and night for play! Heinrich, 'nother three bottles of wine, Brown as the eye of a maid I know— Cheers for the maiden, cheers for the vine, Up to your feet, boys, now let her go! Sherry, sherry, rich brown sherry, Draw the cork and let's be merry. Here's to all the brown-eyed maids, Blue-eyed, black-eyed and all shades; Drink and sing the night away— Day for work and night for play! Heinrich, 'nother three bottles of wine, And say, good fellow, please chalk it down; That last you brought was deucedly fine, Bouquet charming; its color so brown. Sherry, sherry, rich brown sherry, Draw the cork and let's be merry. We must drink if debts are made, We must drink if they're not paid. Drink and sing the night away— Day for work and night for play! WITH THE SUNRISE GUN. And why should I be sad? And why should you be glad? To-morrow will come With the sunrise gun, When I may be glad While you may be sad— Ah, should I not wait till then? What if the skies are gray And hide the sun away; To-morrow will come With the sunrise gun, The sun will break through, The sky will be blue, Ah, should we not wait till then? O, sweetheart, 'way with tears, With wav'ring hopes and fears. Your lover will come With the sunrise gun. He'll bring you gifts from many lands, He'll kiss your lips, he'll kiss your hands, Ah, can you not wait till then? REINCARNATION. The clanging fire-bells shook the air, The maddened crowd roared like the sea And hurled its human waves 'gainst me— Then through the smoke a face gleamed fair A moment brief—and then the crash As chariot wheels together dash; Mad horses rear and plunge and scream— It all comes back, an old, old dream, The brutal shout that shakes the walls As in the dust my chariot falls, The yellow cloud of strangling dust And I 'neath broken chariot thrust, The cruel faces from the tiers— Then through it all a face appears, With pity sweet and white with fears, There in the box where Cæsar sneers! MY FRIENDS IN BOHEMIA. Friends have I in Bohemia three— My pipe, my dog, myself, you see We make a jolly trinity— We three are careless Bohemians. When editors reject my “stuff,” The larder's lean and things look “tough,” My friend, the pipe, gives me a “puff”— My friend number one in Bo-he-mi-a. I look into my dog's brown eyes, He whines as if to sympathize, That he's hungry you'd ne'er surmise, My friend number two in Bohemia. When I come in I hear his bark Shout welcome down the stairway dark. Just strike a match—yes, that's he—hark! My friend number two in Bo-he-mi-a. My pipe is more to me than maid, It ne'er with my affections played, Nor of my heart a football made— This friend number one in Bohemia. My dog is more than man to me, He never lied to me, you see, While man has lied to and on me— God save my friends in Bo-he-mi-a. TWICE THE MAPLE BLUSHES. I O, twice the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy red; She blushes in the Spring-time, When aroused from Winter's sleep, She finds herself all naked And the gaping world apeep, O, then the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy red. II Once again the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy red; She blushes in the Autumn, When she lays her robes aside For the long, long sleep of Winter, And finds naught 'neath which to hide, O, then the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy red. A NIGHT IN JUNE. I “What so rare as a day in June?” O poet, hast thou never known A night in rose-voluptuous June? High over all a broad, full moon, Grey broken clouds that sink and swoon In floods of light, Which down the sky's vast steepness pour, Niagara in all save roar— Sound lost in sight! II Now serenades the midnight moon, The beetle's drum, the frog's bassoon, And mingled with these rises shrill The piccolo of whip-poor-will Played in the beech just on yon hill, Now moon-gold crowned; Then tinkling notes of light guitar, With voices softened from afar, Sight lost in sound! QUATRAINS. [The Earth, a leper foul with scars and sores] I The Earth, a leper foul with scars and sores, Lay naked in most hideous plight, When Boreas flung down his ermined robe And hid from men the sick'ning sight! II Lo where December's snows the deepest lay, The wheat of June the brightest gleams; E'en so deep sorrows when with patience borne, Oft-times nurse joys beyond our dreams! III O, lonely pine on yonder hill, I hear thy sighing, moaning; Make concord sad within my soul, Its countless sins atoning! ECLIPSE. Diana lay sleeping in the West, Her snowy, lissome limbs were bare; Her robe had slipped adown her breast And Phœbus, 'raptured, saw her there. The sleeper felt his look of flame And restless, tossed her arms with grace; Awoke—then blushing at her shame Within her mantle hid her face! A MEMORY TONE. She played, And gleaming fingers touched the keys, As if upon their souls she played, While the mad desire grew fierce to seize Them in the Bastile, swiftly made Of my strong hands. She played, And o'er white shoulder flung a look That almost drove me mad with pain; My love ran toward her as the brook When bank-brimmed o'er with April rain Runs swift to sea. She played— A brook went purling o'er a stone, Its rhythmic lip was dripping song; Upon its bank I stood alone, With brook and soul in concord strong, And life so young. She played— The tinkling sheep-bells filled the glade, A thrush's song was in the air; The water elms threw speckled shade, Wild flowers were blooming everywhere, The while she played. She ceased, And while white arms were 'round my neck And kisses on my lips were hot, And love stood waiting at my beck, I only know, I recked it naught— Life seemed so old! MY FISHER LASS. I stood beside the Summer sea And watched far out my Fisher Lass Row swiftly in her boat to me, And the sea shone like a glass. She waved her strong, brown hand to me, The boat flew swiftly in from sea, The osprey laughed in wild, wild glee To see her row so swift to me. Laugh, laugh, sea-birds and glad, glad sea, My soul laughs too in mad, mad glee; I catch her in my waiting arms And lose my fears of wrecks and storms; I brush the sea-damp locks aside And kiss the mouth she tries to hide. I stand beside a Winter sea, A storm-wrecked boat lies on the shore; The sea moans sad an elegy, For my lass rows in no more. No more across the Summer sea My Fisher Lass rows into me; I wait each day upon the shore— They say that she will come no more. Moan, moan aloud, thou Winter sea, My Fisher Lass is lost to me! The ships ride in, the ships ride out, I hear their sailors' mournful shout. Some day, I know, across the sea My Fisher Lass will row to me. BEFORE THE FIRE. Before the wide-mouthed hearth I sit, While rudely roars the wind outdoor; Upon the walls strange shadows flit Or dervish-like dance on the floor; Now softened to a minor strain, As if it came from far away, As if the wail of souls in pain, The long imprisoned sunbeams' lay. For aeons since when young was Time, And Earth still wore the flush of Youth, Long ere the birth of Man and Crime, And dark-browed Hate and tear-stained Ruth, The tyrant Sun imprisoned in The heart of oak and ash his beams To expiate some unknown sin— Some woodsprite told me in my dreams. The flames that up the chimney race And clap with glee their red, red hands, Or snap their fingers in my face, Or 'sault the wall in storming bands, Are sunbeams bright but now set free From centuries of prison dark— A spirit moves each flame I see, A sunbeam's soul is in each spark. RICHARD III. I see thy smile; at times, May's warm, young sun, At times, December's cold and threat'ning sky; Thy woman's hand aplucking at thy sword, The lightning lurking in thy deep-set eye. Alone, thy face a stage whereon doth play Ambition, Hate, Lust, Murder; flitting out And in the gloomy wings of thy dark soul— A fearsome and a most unholy rout! And yet withal a kingly look oft-times Conveys an air of high-born royalty That overshadows all thine awful crimes And stamps e'en them somewhat with majesty. Liar, Traitor, Murd'rer through all thy life— Hero and King at Bosworth's fatal strife! MORS ET VITA. Into the soil a seed is sown, Out of the soul a song is wrung, Out of the shell a pearl is gone, Out of the cage a bird is flown, Out of the body, a soul! Unto a tree the seed is grown, Wide in the world the song is sung, The pearl in a necklace gleams more fair, The bird is flown to a sweeter air, And Death is half and Life is half, And the two make up the whole! COMPENSAZIONE. O, rich young lord, thou ridest by With looks of high disdain; It chafes me not thy title high, Thy blood of oldest strain. The lady riding at thy side Is but in name thy promised bride, Ride on young lord, ride on! Her father wills and she obeys, The custom of her class; 'Tis Land not Love the trothing sways— For Land he sells his lass. Her fair white hand, young lord, is thine, Her soul, proud fool, her soul is mine, Ride on young lord, ride on! No title high my father bore; The tenant of thy farm, He left me what I value more: Clean heart, clear brain, strong arm And love for bird and beast and bee And song of lark and hymn of sea, Ride on young lord, ride on! The boundless sky to me belongs, The paltry acres thine; The painted beauty sings thy songs, The lavrock lilts me mine; The hot-housed orchid blooms for thee, The gorse and heather bloom for me, Ride on young lord, ride on! SERENADE SONG. Hist, Dolores, I am coming, Gently my guitar I'm thrumming, 'Neath thy casement softly humming, Dolores, O, carissima! All the world but me is sleeping, Nothing but the stars is peeping, Up to thee my soul is leaping, Dolores, O, carissima! Rise, and wide thy shutter flinging, List, O list, my soul is singing, All my soul to love's time swinging, Dolores, O, carissima! Outward from thy casement leaning, Turn thine eyes upon me beaming, Twin stars thro' the darkness gleaming, Dolores, O, carissima! Nightly 'neath thy casement singing, All my soul with passion ringing, Up to thee my soul I'm flinging, Dolores, O, carissima! Thro' the summer's roses hoping, Thro' the autumn's dead leaves groping, Where the vine's dead leaves are dropping, Dolores, O, carissima! Still, my love, O still thou'rt sleeping, While my soul for thee is weeping, While Love's hand the strings is sweeping, Dolores, O, carissima! When, O, when, this long sleep breaking, Will thy love, to life awaking, On thy lips my kisses taking, Know thy lover, me, Francisco? AMICI TRES. I Some friends I had, they numbered three— Tom, Lee and Ben; staunch friends were we. O, life was sweet and life was young, And love filled all the songs we sung. Boy's love for boy is stronger than The honeyed love of maid for man, Like David's love for Jonathan. Life's tide rolled on, we all grew up And drained the lees of manhood's cup— A sweetheart parted Ben and me, A race for office drove off Lee, And money loaned was Tom's sole plea— The money that was loaned by me. II Some friends I had, they numbered three— My mother, wife, myself. You see We made another trinity. The first and second always true, But shall I tell the truth to you? I found the third, worst enemy. More dangerous than the foe without, Who rushes on with sword and shout, Is Self, who never makes a din, But, like a sapper, works within, Until he undermines the wall And sends it crashing to its fall! III Again my friends they number three— Wife, mother, Christ—great trinity! When in the fiery furnace tried I found these three walked at my side; They faced the fiercest furnace heat That 'gainst my shrinking soul did beat, Nor storm nor calm nor joy nor grief, Nor trials sore beyond belief. Myself within, fierce foes without, Dismay them not with battle shout. Again I count my friends as three— Wife, mother, Christ, the strongest three, My all sufficing trinity! THROUGH OCTOBER FIELDS. The startled quail in covies whir From 'neath your feet as on you stray Along the narrow thread-like path, This cool October day. The grouse's booming drum of bass Peals from the hollow on your right, Till 'larumed by your near approach He wheels in sudden flight. And on the trunk of yon dead tree The “flicker” “Flicker” is a local name in Southern Ohio for the yellow hammer or golden-winged woodpecker. He gets the name from his cry: “Flicker! Flicker! Flicker!” His flight is undulatory. —Author. beats his fierce tattoo, Then hurls back from his wave-like flight Defiance shrill to you. On every side the golden rod's Long, graceful plumes of tawny gold And ageratum's purple bloom— The banners of the wold. The stubble of the June-reaped wheat Stands up in bristling ranks of spears, Its gold is covered now with frost, Like warriors grey with years. And over all the golden haze Soft wraps the brown Earth in a dream, While every breath across the fields Rich draughts of rare wines seem. There in the stream beneath the elms, The leaves, like ships of Lil'put, fair, Drift down, sans rudders and sans sails To ports that lie nowhere. See in the field beyond the stream, Pitched wide o'er all the bottom land, An Indian village quaintly shown, The cornshock wigwams stand. Now, you are “near to nature's heart,” You lie upon her tawny breast; You feel her warm breath on your cheek As in her arms you rest. THE HAWK. This pirate of the over sea, No black-hulled brig he sails, No black flag at the mizzen-peak Flaunts death-heads to the gales. Yet fiercer than the wild Corsair This pirate of the upper air. Watch how he listless drifts along, His wings with winds at sport— But look! a sail has hove in sight, A dove has crossed to port. See how he crowds on ev'ry sail And screams his war-cry to the gale. The frightened dove—a merchantman Has not a gun to give him fight; With all her canvas to the wind, She tacks to starboard, wild with fright. Ah! vain for her this tack to take, Like Fate he follows in her wake! She weakens in her useless flight, The wind is beating in her face. But watch him as he drives along, His ev'ry motion—strength and grace— She's overhauled! Her course is run! A fierce, fierce scream, the chase is won! MARY OF MAGDALA. Poor harlot, Mary Magdalene, Into the feast with trembling crept, Past frowns that stabbed her with their hate And falling at His feet she wept. Self-righteous Simon spurned her there And marveled that her sinful touch Displeased Him not, but he forgave: “Though sinning sore she love'd much.” Brave, grateful Mary Magdalene, When Peter all his faith had lost, Pressed on through swords of arme'd men And knelt in grief beneath the cross; She bathed the nail-pierced feet with tears That mingled with His trickling blood, While Andrew, Matthew, James and all Far off in abject terror stood. Saved, faithful MARY MAGDALENE Through all that morning's doubt and gloom, When Hope and Faith had fled the world, Brought from that empty shattered tomb The words that thrill a save'd world— With flying feet and sobbing breath: “The Christ is risen as he said, Triumphant Lord of conquered Death!” A LOVE DREAM. I know 'twas a dream, yet sweet was the theme, And I strive to recall its splendor— My soul upward leaps as Thought backward sweeps To my dream so warm and so tender. Where sea billows toss 'neath the bright Southern cross, By the sea lay I idly dreaming, While the stars burned a way from Night unto Day And the waves like helmets were gleaming. A maid came and stood at the neck of the wood And her locks on the Night were streaming, She was tall as pines that rock in the winds, And her eyes like Orion were gleaming. She came to me there and caught up her hair And spread it a mantle above me— O my soul grew sick and the hot air thick As she whispered: “Come sweet, now love me.” I kissed the red mouth of th' passionate South, Till my lips with kissing grew husky, I looked in the eyes that were storm-charged skies, 'Neath the cloud of her thick locks dusky. Then up the Day came with cohorts of flame And the Soul of the South Wind left me, And Joy fled away with the Rise of the Day, For Day, of my Love had bereft me. I know 'twas a dream, yet sweet was the theme, And I strive to recall its splendor— My soul upward leaps as Thought backward sweeps To my dream so warm and so tender. A SONG. [Heigho for a glass, heigho for a lass] Heigho for a glass, heigho for a lass, A drink and a kiss, I leave you; Heigho for a friend that sticks till the end— Good-bye, my lass, don't you grieve you. Hurrah for a song that is not too long, With a jolly roaring chorus, While our cans beat time to the ringing rhyme Till the ceiling cracks up o'er us. Heigho for an eye as blue as the sky And a mouth that's red and tender; For a chin that's round and a cheek that's brown As the oak leaves in November. Hurrah for a horse on a wind-swept course And a night as black as hell is, And a gallop blind in face o' the wind To calm a soul that fell is. Heigho for a glass, heigho for a lass, A drink and a kiss, I leave you; Heigho for a friend that sticks till the end— Good-bye, my lass, don't you grieve you. THE POINT OF VIEW. The poet stood in ecstasy Before the field with daisies sweet— A waving sea of white and gold: “Well named,” he said, “Sweet Marguerite. Fair as her own sweet self you are, You represent her better part— White as the newest snow without, And deep within, all gold at heart.” Then, stooping low with eyes all soul, He plucked one for his button-hole. The farmer leaned across the fence, A scowl was on his wrinkled brow As on the marguerites he frowned: “Gosh darn the luck, I'll du it naow; Them consarned weeds ull taak the place, They're baout tu run me off the farm; Them air ox-eyes uv gut tu go So they wont du the craps no harm.” Then pulling up an armful—big, He threw them over to the pig! BIRD-SONG. Cheereen! Cheewink! O poet, We've come to stay, to stay. Cheereen! Cheewink! You know it, And smile as we pipe our lay. Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheewink! Cheereen! See all the hillsides turning green, The sun is bright, The sky is light, Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheewink! O poet, We've come to play, to play. Cheereen! Cheewink! You know it— O smile as we pipe our lay. Cheereen! Cheewink! Cheereen! Cheewink! O list our notes, they rise, they sink Upon the air, So rich, so rare, Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheewink! O toiler, 'Tis time to work, to work. The brook tells thee, the brawler, 'Tis time to cease to shirk. Cheereen! Cheewink! Cheereen! Cheewink! Not of the toil but harvest think, Bring out thy plow, 'Tis work time now, Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen! THE PARIAH. Owned her father all the fact'ries Which their black'ning smoke sent up, Miles and miles all 'round the country, From the town by hills pent up. Traced he back his proud ancestry To the Rock on Plymouth's shore, Traced I mine to Dutch ship landing At Jamestown, one year before. Thus was she of haughty lineage, I of mongrel race had sprung; O'er my fathers in the workfield Whips of scorpions had been swung. Years of freedom were her race's, Years of cruel slavery mine; Years of culture were her race's, Years of darkest ign'rance mine. She a lily sought by all men, I a thistle shunned by all; She the Brahmin, I the Pariah Who must e'er before her crawl. Fair was I as her complexion, Honest came my fairness, too, For my father and my mother Were in wedlock banded true. Yes, this mixing of the races Had been years, long years ago, That you could not trace the streamlet To the fountain whence the flow. Like an eagle long imprisoned Soared I into realms of light, Scorning all the narrow valley, Where my wings had plumed for flight. In the Sun of modern science I had soaring bathed my wings, And rose higher, higher, higher, 'Bove a world of narrow things. Then on proudly soaring pinions I forgot my lowly birth, When Caste's arrow, venom laden, Struck me, shot me down to Earth. Kind and friendly had she ever Seemed and acted unto me, Till of late a cold restrainment Seemed to bar her manners free. Then my sens'tive soul quick thinking That the Pride of Caste was born In her mind, grew cold and distant, Though it pricked me like a thorn, And my thoughts grew dark and bitter, Bitter as the wild aloe. I became a sneering cynic, Deeming every man a foe, Scorning books while scorning people. In their pages naught I saw But I libelled, but I censured, Every sentence found a flaw; Till one night the mad mob gathered, Called in voices wild and loud I should quickly come before them, And address the raging crowd. They were strikers, who were workmen For her father stern and proud, And they threatened to destroy him And his works in curses loud. At the call I stepped before them, And they greeted wild and strong, And my heart grew hot with hatred Of Oppression, Caste and Wrong, While the words poured out like lava From the crater of my brain— Burning, seething, hissing, raging With the years of pent-up pain. They had gathered by the great works, With their blazing furnace doors, And the lofty, flaming chimneys, Up whose throats the hot blast roars; And the furnace threw its hot light 'Pon their toilworn, swarthy faces, While the flames from out the chimnies Painted heaven with their blazes. In their hands they held their weapons— Tools for toil, and not for war; On the great mill rolled and thundered, Shaking heaven with its jar. And their brows were dark with hatred, And their cheeks were hot with rage, And their voices low were growling, Like wild beasts penned in a cage. And the tiger rose within me With a growl that was a curse, And I breathed his breath of passion, And I felt his awful thirst. But her image came before me, With her sad, reproachful eyes, And her locks of sunset splendor When the summer daylight dies. Then banished was hot Passion, While Mercy pleaded low, And I cooled their angry fury, As hot iron is cooled in snow. And she comes and stands before me As I gaze into the stream, And I see her, I behold her As some vision in a dream, And the waves of love come surging And they sweep my will away, For I love her, O I love her— Aye, forever and a day! And I called her: “Edie! Edie!” As I'd called her oft before, When as little guileless children We plucked lilies from this shore. Oh my voice sobbed like a harp string When the rough hand breaks a chord, And it wailed and moaned as sadly As some broken-hearted bard. And she came up to me quickly When I thus wailed out her name, All her soul rose in her blue eyes There was ne'er a look of shame, And she threw her arms up to me And I caught her to my heart, While the whole earth reeled beneath me And the heavens fell apart! Faint and trembling then I asked her What the cruel world would say, While she blushed but spoke out bravely: “We'll forget the World to-day. This I only know, I love you, I have loved you all the while; What care I then for your lineage Or the harsh world's frown or smile. Men are noble from their actions, From their deeds and theirs alone, Father's deeds are not their children's— Reap not that by others sown. They are naught but dwarfish pigmies Who would scorn you for your birth; Who would scorn you for your lineage, Raise they not their eyes from Earth. What is blood? The human body? Trace it back, it leads to dust, Trace it forward, same conclusion, Naught but vile dust find you must. But the soul is sent from heaven And the Sculptor-Hand is God's Part and parcel of his being, While our bodies are but clods!”</field>
