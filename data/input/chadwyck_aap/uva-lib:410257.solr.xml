      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS. EMMA V. MONTGOMERY, My faithful critic and friend of past years, and with kind wishes for her future happiness and prosperity, this book is respectfully dedicated. PREFACE. The millions of Negroes in this country, and their right of suffrage, will count but little in their history without proportionate and conspicuous brain power; for it is cultivated intellect that commands respect, disarms prejudice and forces itself to the front rank of majestic manhood. Our race can only succeed in winning a place in history by cultivating a pride of race through a high order of character and education, and by commemorating such notable events and deeds during their existence as are calculated to claim the attention of future historians and the reverence of their posterity; for a race will be remembered only by its deeds, and not by its condition and numbers. The grand results of the war are: Freedom to the slave, the right of suffrage, and the privilege to hold office. To justify these results, and the hopes of the friends of freedom, the Negro had a grave responsibility on his shoulders. If he began with credit to his race, (his opportunities considered,) well and good; but if he fell short of what was reasonably expected of him, his friends in the North might have felt disgusted, and probably forsaken him. Congress, the great arena of the nation, was the only place where the American people and the world could see him and test his abilities and manhood. Mr. Menard, being the first of his race elected to Congress, represented not only his race, but the immediate results of the war. His position was a trying one; and that he acquitted himself with credit and marked ability, the accompanying notices of the press of the country fully attest. Mr. Menard was born at Kaskaskia, Illinois, and his parents were descendants of colored Creole French of New Orleans. During the war he came to Washington, and entering the emigration field, was appointed a clerk in the Bureau of Emigration, Interior Department. This was the first time a Negro held a clerkship in the Government service. He went to British Honduras in 1863, with a view of founding a colony of colored emigrants from this country. On his return, he made a report to President Lincoln, which was published. In 1865 he went to New Orleans, and was soon after appointed Inspector of Customs. He was subsequently appointed one of the Street Commissioners of that city. He published two papers there—first the Free South, and afterwards the Radical Standard. He was nominated for Congress in 1868, receiving twenty-two votes out of a convention of thirty delegates, and declared elected by the proper authorities of the State, Mr. Menard ran for an unexpired term of the Fortieth Congress, and General Sheldon ran on the same ticket for the Forty-first Congress. Both received the same vote, and both were declared elected by the same State authority. The fact that General Sheldon was seated and Menard, not, proves very fully that his color kept him out. However, he received the same pay (2,500) as would have been given him had he been seated. He broke the ice, however, for others of his race to follow. Mr. Menard removed to Florida in 1871, and published a paper there called The Sun. He was appointed a clerk in the Postoffice at Jacksonville; and while in that position, was elected to the Legislature. After serving out his term, he was appointed a Collector of Internal Revenue, and also, afterwards, was twice appointed Justice of the Peace. In 1876 he was elected a Delegate to the National Republican Convention at Cincinnati. In all of these public trusts—many of them of great importance—he proved himself capable and faithful, and retired from them without a stain on his official integrity. For these brave and determined efforts to prove the ability of his race, he deserves their approval, and that of every true lover of justice and equality; and I am sure that none will hesitate to award him the merit he deserves, or deny him the place in history to which he is justly entitled. F. G. BARBADOES. Washington, D. C., October 5, 1879. On issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.TO PRESIDENT LINCOLN. Thou hast spoken!—Let the earth resound With hallelujahs to our gracious God!— The gladsome news—four million men will soon No longer groan beneath the tyrant's rod! Thy words are echoed by ten million hearts From hill to dale—to the islands of the sea: They are Redemption's chartered harbingers, When men—no longer slaves, but free shall be! Thou hast spoken! and a million arms Are gleaming brightly from the battle van; And banners proudly waving on the breeze— Presaging victory to thy ripening plan! Thou hast spoken! and thy name shall glow Forever on Columbia's altar bright; For thou hast stayed a vile, despotic tide, And bravely battled for the trampled right! May thy footsteps ever lead thee upward— Upward to that bright, celestial land: Where safely sheltered from the storms of life, Thou'lt join the heroes of the Patriots' band. GRANT'S FIRST ELECTION. Once more, O harp! let me gentle touch Thy thrilling numbers soft and sweet— Once more with new-born energies The King of Liberty to greet! With joy complete, And hope replete, Thy notes of triumph now repeat! All hail the Chief! the good, the great— The new-made King of Liberty! Let cannon, bell, and trumpet sound, From mountain, valley, plain, and sea! And Dark and Light No longer fight, For Wrong has yielded unto Right! From icy North to sunny South, Let the proud flag of Freedom wave! Let its broad, starry folds, unfurled, The storms of dark Oppression brave! For Heaven gave No man a slave, The sweets of Liberty to crave! This land is Freedom's heritage— The home of Liberty and Peace; And Treason, with its fiendish deeds, In the fair, sunny South, shall cease; And God to Thee, We bend our knee, And thank Thee for our victory! THE WIFE'S INVOCATION. “Love me, leave me not”—no never, Life is dark and full of woe; We are one and cannot sever, Though the winds of sorrow blow! True, I often sigh in sorrow— Sigh because your words are cold; But the sunshine of the morrow, Fills my heart with joy untold. “Love me, leave me not,” for dreary Are the days when you're away; And my heart grows sick and weary, As I vainly sigh and pray. Once a warm love cheer'd my bosom, When our years were young and gay; Now 'tis faded—but 'twill blossom, When this long night turns to day! “Love me, leave me not,” in anguish, Press your warm lips unto mine; Then this heart no more will languish, If again you call me thine. We have kiss'd and truly given Vows before the sacred shrine; And we're one on earth—in Heaven— You are mine and I am thine! Love me—claim this aching bosom, Press it once more to thine own! And the flow'rs of Hope will blossom Where the pangs of sorrow burn! Take me, I am thine forever— Soon from earth we'll pass away; But we'll meet, when here we sever, In a brighter land of day. TO E. M. T., OF JAMAICA. Away from thy green island home, From beneath thy blue tropic skies; Thou sendest me missives to come, Where the hue of the rose never dies. If thy soft, gentle spirit now pines, For a form that is now far away; I will send you these few simple lines, To beguile the long weary day. Thy friendship, though young, I will keep, And its ties I will try to improve, Till like wand'ring vines they will creep, Upon the famed bower of love! Thy mem'ry like a bright sunny beam, Lingers near me by day and by night, Like the swift fairy pinion and gleam, Of a heavenly vision of light! Fare thee well in thy sweet island home, Till the one who is far from thee now, Again to thy bosom shall come, With kisses so sweet for thy brow! FIRST SABBATH OF THE YEAR. Almighty God of love divine, Fill us anew with love and fear, While we now worship at Thy shrine, This first sweet Sabbath of the year! We've wander'd from Thy paths of Right, And tread the thorny walks of Sin, Which lead us from Thy heavenly light That gives such endless joy within! Oh, Father, pity and forgive Such erring children as we are! Thy love, oh give us—lest we live Forevermore in black despair! A New Year now, with radiant light, Bids us be loving and sincere, While we now pledge the paths of Right To humbly walk throughout the year. Then fill us with Thy love divine, Great Ruler of the starry sphere! And softly whisper “We are thine,” This first bright Sabbath of the year! STANZAS ON CUBA. Unfurl once more the banner of the free, And on to Cuba with songs of liberty! Four hundred thousand men are still in chain Beneath the galling yoke of cruel Spain. Reach out, Columbia! thy powerful hand, And aid the struggling Patriots' band, Who for long, gloomy years of fire and blood, Against the savage hordes of Spain have stood. Reach out, and teach the buccaneers of Spain That slaves no more can breath near thy domain; And that henceforth the Western Hemisphere, No more the clanking chains of slaves shall hear. Poor, bleeding isle! take hope: despotic Spain Must soon release thee from her galling chain; Her madness and the murders of her bands, Are the last links that bind thy suppliant hands. Unfurl the dear old flag, with joyful songs, And on to Cuba to right the Patriots' wrongs; Come war or peace, that island must be free, The jig is up, all hail the jubalee! JUST OVER THE SEA. Just over the sea, In a green sunny isle, Lives a maiden whose smile Is sunlight to me. She's a sweet, fairy one, Whose soft, mellow voice, Has made me rejoice In hours that are gone. Her footstep, so light— With tresses that curl, And fine teeth of pearl, With eyes quite as bright. My heart to her flows With pure, simple love, Like rain from above, Wherever she goes. Just over the sea Is the girl of my choice, Whose angel-like voice Is music to me! Though cares may betide, I'll soon call her my wife, Through all coming life, And stay by her side! ESTELLA. IN HONDURAS, 1863. The sun was high in the torrid skies, his westward course pursuing, While fell in profusion his golden rays on the vernal fields of Honduras. The crystal dew of the rosy morn, in the cups of the flowers still linger'd, While their odor sweet, that freighted the air, perfumed the murmering zephyrs. The sportive birds, with their plumage rare, in the air, their course were winging, While fell on the ear, their merry songs, like the notes of the flute on the waters! 'Twas on a morning like this that I were to set out, with a skillful band of explorers, For the far-off western hills and dales in the vernal wilds of Honduras. After freighting our proud and restless boat, with luggage, provisions, utensils, We spread her snowy wings to the wind, and sailed up the coast of Honduras! Bright was the scene on the coast that we saw, as we wung o'er the heads of the surges, While the hue of the sylvan isles that we pass'd, seemed to rival the blue in the waters. Calmy, silently, the day wore on—like the monotonous voice of the breakers, Till twilight came with a noiseless step and threw her pall o'er the waters. The stars bowed low when their mother moon rose up in the glittering heavens. Then followed her westward on her silver tract, like children following their mother. Noiselessly, lonely, the night wore on, till the rays of the morning descended, On the far-off drifting eastern clouds, like the smiles of a bride on her husband! At anchor, we leisurely, merrily rode, right in front of an ancient village, While our cook, in rudely, hunter style, our morning refreshments was serving. The rays of the tropic sun dispersed the clouds on the eastern horizon, Then fell on the shrubbery, the houses and water, like the drops of the dew on the flowers. Then my guide and myself started off, in a red canoe for the landing, And like lost sheep we strolled along through the grassy streets of the village. Sweet and bright were the scenes that we saw, as we walked up the streets of the village, But sweeter by far, were the starry eyes and angel-forms of the maidens! Especially one—Estella—the queen, and belle of that tropical village; The ray of whose humid eyes, I ween, could have wooed an angel from heaven! Her bosom heaved, her eyes spoke love, and her hair, like the wing of the raven, And happy was he, who could touch her hand or even the hem of her garment! My eyes were filled with unshed tears, when I heard on the eave of the morrow, Estella, the queen, was to be a bride, and would sail on the sea with her husband! FLORIDA. Sweet ocean goddess, divinely fair and free, Outstretching far into the summer sea, As if to catch the constant ocean breeze That swiftly speeds over the gulf and seas! Thou art a fairy land—a “Land of Flowers,” With towering pines and vine-clad bowers— With boundless lakes and broad, majestic streams, That bask forever in bright, sunny gleams. Dear sunny land of orange and balmy sky, Where summer reigns and flowers never die! Thrice bless'd art thou, with trees forever green, And varied fruit, with air and clime serene. Long hast thou groaned 'neath burdens of the Past,— Ravaged by wars and by oppression blast: But now take hope—thy future shall be bright, Thy chains have fallen, and ended is thy night. Thy wasted fields and trees will yield again: Redoubled harvests shall thy sons regain. Thy hidden wealth, and healing balmy clime, And charming scenery, varied and sublime, Must lure from every clime, from every land, Uncounted thousands to thy shores of sand. And these will summon forth, with skilful toil, The hidden treasures of thy wasted soil. Take hope and rise, land of the fig and pine! Thy woes are ended and new life is thine. Labor and Liberty, and wealth and power, Henceforth will be thy allotted dower! Live Oak, Fla., a junction.WAITING AT LIVE OAK. Of all the minor woes, A mortal undergoes, 'Tis waiting in shawl or cloak Seven hours at Live Oak! Waiting from nine to four, Seven hours, sometimes more, Amid box-cars and logs, And the music of the frogs. Musquitos, bugs and fleas, Vile dust or raging seas, Inflict, by far, less pain, Than waiting for a train. Ye gods of Rome and Greece, When shall this waiting cease— This waiting in the cold and rain For the Savannah train! I'd much prefer to take A ride o'er Great Salt Lake— The mountains of the moon, Or to the grand Ty-coon, Than wait in rain or cold, With minor woes untold, Wrapp'd up in shawl or cloak, Seven hours at Live Oak! SABBATH EVE MUSINGS. The Sabbath bells—how sweet their chime! Now floating on the air, Calling, with solemn tones sublime, Souls to the house of prayer. Sweet heavenly music, float along, Upon the air of even; Thy notes invite the careless throng From sinful paths to heaven! I'm all alone this Sabbath eve, Pondering o'er the past— The faded past that makes me grieve For joys that could not last. Come back to me, ye faded forms, This sad, sweet Sabbath night; Though faded, yet your memory charms Like rays of heavenly light! O, floating memories ever dear, Why do ye make me sad? Why do ye woo the silent tear From eyes that would be glad? Ye dragging hours of woe and gloom, Freighted with toil and care: Driving the light from out my room, And leaving dark despair! The West wind groans against the door, The fire has lost its glow; My faithful lamp, with green shade o'er, Burns silently and low. And so with me, I'm waning too— I'm feeling tired of life; Sweet sleep and rest my eyelids woo— Farewell to daily strife! A GLANCE. Is thy name Mary, maiden fair? Such should, I think, its music be; The sweetest name that women bear Were best befitting thee; And she, to whom it once was given, Was half of earth and half of heaven. I hear thy voice, I see thy smile, I look upon thy folded hair; Ah! while I dream not they beguile, My heart is in the snare; And she, who chains a wild bird's wing, Must start not if her captive sing! MUSINGS. The gentle moon now silvers The bosom of the sea, While zephyrs make the forest Resound with melody! I set me down to ponder Beside this moon-lit stream; And while I muse, sweet Luna Will cheer me with her beam. My brow is dimmed with memories Of faded joys of yore— Of one who now is winging Upon the golden shore. Two years ago to-morrow— How long to me they seem! My girl and I were wooing Beside this very stream! Her humid eyes, so dreamy, Made shame the stars above,— While her voice so sweet and mellow, Was like the voice of Love! But now she sweetly slumbers Beneath the dewy sod, While wings her angel spirit Around the throne of God! TO MY WIFE. [At Kingston, Jamaica, West Indies.] Thou art gone to thine island home, On the Caribbean shore— Gone to thy dear old native scenes, Among thy friends of yore. May health, and joy, and hope be thine, Dear comfort of my life; May Heaven's protecting care attend My darlings and my wife! Two little darlings, sweet and bright, With tiny hands and feet— With raven hair and jetty eyes, And voices dear and sweet. They are my jewels and my wealth— My joy, my life, my all; And heavenly music 'tis to me Whene'er I hear them call! But they are gone, and I, alone, Am lonesome and bereft; My life has been a joyless blank E'er since my darlings left. But, ah! this sadd'ning loneliness Will last but for a time: They'll soon return, and, in my heart, I'll hear their voices chime! My darling wife and little ones, Far o'er the foaming main, Weeks will be months, and months long years, Until you come again! [Come back to me, come back to me] Come back to me, come back to me, From o'er the foaming, raging sea: Come back—your home is in my heart, And from its fold no more depart. Come back, for days and nights are drear, And home seems desolate and queer; The sunny joys of home have fled, And chaos reigns o'er floor and bed. Come back, your chickens go half-fed; The weeds have worn—your flow'rs are dead! Disorder rules supreme o'er all, And webs are thick on every wall. Come back with sunny joys and smiles, Come back with laughing hearts and eyes; Come back to soothe, come back to cheer, And all this sad confusion clear. TO MADAME SELIKA. O siren of the colored race, With matchless voice and queenly grace! 'Tis thine to move the heart to tears, And lift it to the upper spheres! Sweet heavenly gifts to thee belong, To heal our ills with magic song; And make our drooping hearts rejoice With the sweet pathos of thy voice! Enchantress from the sunset glow! Thy notes in mellow cadence flow; Like music from a hidden lyre, Or echoes from the heavenly choir! Selika! thou art sent to shame, The scoffers of our race, who blame, And curse the Negro for his skin,— And wrong him for this God-sent sin! ON THE BANKS OF THE ST. JOHN'S. Majestic stream! vast inland sea! Great mirror of the skies; Upon thy banks I'll sing of thee, While thy tides fall and rise! Thy bosom, stretching far away, Into the woodland green: Now turbid, angry surges sway— Now lulled in sweet serene! Thy grandeur now inspires my heart With sentiments sublime; And while I muse my thoughts depart Upon thy waves' sweet chime! I sit enraptured, and am bound With feelings strange and sweet: Enchantment burdens every sound Which the charmed waves repeat. Far, far away on rippling waves, Sweet heavenly grandeurs ride; The golden sunshine sports and laves Upon thy rolling tide! Majestic stream, thy beauty feeds The senses with delight, And from its gloomy portal leads The heart to heavenly light. Sweet heavenly vision!—fairy stream For which the poets long, O, could I put thy beauty's gleam Into immortal song! This sweet enchantment and the spell That binds me to thy shore, Will live in memory's secret cell, A charm forevermore. And now farewell majestic stream!— Ye sun kissed waves in strife: Your grandeur will forever seem The day-dream of my life! HOMEWARD BOUND. Spread her snowy riggings wide, Turn her prow towards the tide; Let the sailor's song resound, As we o'er the breakers bound! Steer her to my native hills, To my valleys, streams and rills, Steer her to my own dear shore, To the lov'd ones home once more. Hear the sailors' voices sound, As we merrily, merrily bound, O'er the angry ocean's foam, As we plow towards my home! Joyous hearts and sparkling eyes, Wait us 'neath our own blue skies, Waiting for our souls to cheer, With a happy, welcome tear! Soon upon my natal shore, There to greet kind friends once more, Sweet will be the kiss I ween, Of my maiden love and queen! PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW. I have a gentle love, whose eyes, With softest radiance glow; She is a seraph from the skies To cheer me here below! Her mellow voice fills me with bliss, With its soft silvery flow: And who this angel being is, Perhaps you'd like to know! I won this dark-eyed maiden in Sweet hours of long ago; And how her heart I chanced to win, Perhaps you'd like to know. She is a gentle fairy queen— With pearly teeth of snow; The arms that press this maid, I ween, You'd really like to know! My thoughts, like swift, unfettered creeks, To this sweet angel flow; The lips that kiss her crimson cheeks Perhaps you'd like to know! It is this fairy one that gives Me hope and joy below: And where this little creature lives, Perhaps you'd like to know! MY SISTER. She has pass'd from our band like a heavenly vision, The simple, the kind gentle hearted, They have laid her so gently, so sweetly to slumber, In her tomb among the departed. She has pass'd from our number, and we mourn her so sadly, Her mother, her father and brother, We mourn her so deeply, so greatly and meekly Because we have not another. On her grave in the garden, her mother has planted, Sweet jessamines, lilies and roses, While beneath their perfumery her pure angel spirit, So calmy and sweetly reposes. Sweet Josephine, rest, in thy mansion above! From turmoil, temptation and sorrow; Thy pure spirit now, with the angels is winging, And fears not the cares of the morrow! MUSIC. Sweet Music throws her arms Around the weary heart, And with her mystic charms, Bids its rude cares depart. Like incense sweet it falls, Upon the din-worn ear: And with her voice she calls The soul from heavy fear,— Like odor sweet it floats, Upon the midnight air, Like angels' softest notes, From the celestial choir! Sweet Music—gift of Heaven! Disperser of our wo, To thee is power given, To cheer us here below. We hear thy voice below— We hear it sound above; Which sets our hearts aglow With life, and joy, and love. WE ARE PARTED NOW FOREVER. We are parted now forever, Though our hearts were truly one; Every plighted vow is broken, Every beam of love is gone. Gentle, pure, unstained—go mingle In the world's gay, festive throng; Let no sad, unbidden memory Cause thy simple heart to long. Thickly fall the shades of sorrow Round my sad heart's altar now; While a silent, secret passion Rages over mind and brow. Though life's guiding star seems hidden By this brooding, lowering gloom, Yet upon this waste, now barren, Hope's fair flowers yet may bloom. We are parted—sadly parted, But perhaps 'tis not for life; Love's sweet memory may yet conquer Passion's hot and fleeting strife. CHARLES SUMNER. A monument of prayer and thanks— A monument of tears! Is all that we can offer thee, Dear friend of many years. No towering bronze or marble, To mark thy resting place; Thy lasting monument shall be, The freedom of our race! Our hopes have almost follow'd thee Into the silent grave; For thou wert our tower of strength When man made man a slave. The blow of Brooks upon thy head, Shine forth like diadems, And the bondman's broken fetters, Are thy crown's richest gems. The nation has lost a pillar, And we, a bosom friend: Who can e'er with equal power Our Civil Rights defend? Thou art passed from earth, O, Sumner! Leaving thy work undone; May He who called thee off, complete Thy work so well begun. We must not faint by the wayside, But hope and trust and pray; Our journey leads from dark to light— To Freedom's perfect day. TO GENERAL GRANT. AN ACROSTIC. Great chief of war—no less renowned in peace, Enter again upon thy second lease. Never give ear to slanders; do the part Entrusted to thee by the Nation's heart Rightly, humbly, as best to thee may seem, And then is yours the people's deep esteem. Lead on again, Columbia's chosen son, Great peer of “Father Abe” and Washington! Rally again the sovereigns of the soil, Ah! not to war, but to the fruits of toil. No North or South, no section far or near; The people, all, demand thy equal care. A RETROSPECT. To-night my pensive thoughts are cast Far down the cloud-land of the Past, Amid the scenes when life appeared Bright, new and young, and more endeared— More free from cares and burning tears Than ever since in after years. O, memories of the long ago! When will you tire and cease to flow, And stay in your dim vaults confined, Beyond the portals of my mind? But no! I would not have you cease Your messages of love and peace; Sweet dreams and consolation bring Forever on your viewless wing! Our gentle loves are with the Past, They were too pure and good to last; How dear the echo of their feet, And prattling, music voices sweet, Resounding from the faded shore, Of the bright realm of golden yore! Through the dim space of by-gone years, Some little darling's face appears; A rosy pledge of wedded love, Returned to its bright fold above. The Past to us seems ever dear— The Future full of gloom and fear: The one we know its where and when— The other is beyond our ken. Youth is allied to joy and life; Age to sorrow, care, and strife: The one is like the fount that flows— The other, winter, with its snows! Such are Life's lessons—such the ends To which our groveling nature tends, Till gathered, when the Reaper comes, Into our destined, unknown homes. TO MY LOVE. Come to me fairy queen, To these waiting arms; Thou'rt lovely, and I mean To extol thy charms. Dimpled hands, jetty eyes, Locks of raven hue; Sweet bosom, full of sighs, Tender, warm and true. Glowing cheeks, dimpled chin, Silken lashes long; Rosy lips, soft and thin, Portals of sweet song! Sweet charms, for ever dear— Dear as dear can be; They are mine; love, come near, You belong to me! Now through the cares of life, Constant, true and strong; Be my joy, and my wife, Though the way be long! Suggested by Lamar's speech on Sumner.A PEACE OFFERING. Hail spirit of triumphant Peace! Come down in bright attire Like Minerva 'mid the arms of Greece To quell Achilles' ire. 'Tis time, O North and South, to cease These hates and strifes of yore, And turn into the paths of peace Like brothers now, once more. Be brothers now forever hence, In mutual love and toil; Go forth with manly confidence— Twin monarchs of the soil! No North, no South, no East, no West, One country, flag, and God: The passions of the past should rest With heroes 'neath the sod. We are one people, with one aim, One destiny, one cause— Striving for greatness, power and fame, With equal rank and laws. Arise and cease to sorrow o'er The fortunes of the past; They're gone: our hopes must be for more In the bright future cast. IS IT WORTH WHILE? Is it worth while in these shadowy vales To build on Hope's delusive wing? They are the soul's prison: its sighs and walls Are winters where succeeds a spring! Life blooms and fades; but there's more dark than light, If we the inner shadows take: Our transitory joys and fleet delight Are oases in life's sandy wake. Is it worth while for us to sorrow o'er The fearful horrors of the grave? Our parted ones, far on the Unknown Shore, For earthly joys no longer crave. Is it worth while to build with misspent years A fleeting paradise below? Our joys are brief at best, bedimmed with tears, And marred with gnawing, untold woe. The sunshine of the heart lingers not long, But yields to life's dark inner clouds, That float incessantly in boding throng, Like gloomy Death's appalling shrouds! This life is brief at best; sow goodly seed Of lasting joys beyond the tomb! O, sweet harvest joys—Love's true labor's meed, That in Elysium forever bloom! EASTER HYMN. Hallelujah! Christ has risen! From the tomb's cold, gloomy prison! And to fallen man has given Hope of endless joys in heaven! He has risen in His glory, Mary, go and tell the story, To His chosen, faithful leaders, Who are for His Kingdom pleaders. See! the glory of the morning, Judah's hills and vales adorning, With a splendor, bright and glowing— With the rays of glory flowing! Hallelujah! Christ has risen! From the powers of the prison, To His Father's shining glory, Go and tell the joyful story! SPEAK TO ME KINDLY. O speak to me kindly, Harsh words have no power; They touch not the heart In its sorrowing hour. Kind words fitly spoken Reach down to the heart; And with secret power Bid its sorrows depart. O, speak kindly ever, In sunshine or storm; It will soften rude cares, And keep the heart warm. Then speak to me kindly Dear friend of my heart; And from thy sweet presence I'll never depart! MY TALISMAN. My talisman reposes Amid shrubbery green, And sweet summer roses Of white and crimson sheen. Where sunbeams are wooing The flower and the vine, And plaintive doves cooing, On boughs of oak and pine. Dear spot where I'm “farming”— “My small world set apart,” A goal forever charming, Unto my eyes and heart! Home is not home never, Unless its joys and charms, Cheer one's memory ever, Through life's dark, beating storms. Four little eyes beaming With love and hope complete— Four little hands seeming, To vie with restless feet! Two little heads dozing, Dreaming of fairy things— Like angels reposing, In bed with folded wings! Cup of earthly pleasure Brimful of rosy joy; Holding all my treasure— My bright-eyed girl and boy! TO L. E. M. I want an ideal—a Platonic friend, To whom I humbly could address The passions of my muse, and not offend, But with sweet joy her heart impress. I've scann'd thy features well, and mark'd thy eyes, And sat enraptured with thy voice; Sipping its music with deep drawn sighs, Until I felt my heart rejoice! Thou art my ideal! wilt thou heed my strain, And be the goddess of my mind? Sweet will be the task: thou shalt not complain, But soar above all womankind! If thou consent, O then, thy heart prepare For missives of the poet's art; I'll sing of love and dreams, and beauty rare, And storm the portals of thy heart! TO THE SAME. [TO L. E. M.] O, plead not inability to cope With my poor, simple muse; Thou hast the latent germ and hope, If thou but effort use. The golden ore in Western lands, Is hidden in the mine; Till summoned forth by patient hands, To conquer and to shine! I've seen the germ deep down thy eyes, Just like the hidden ore; And patient effort will suffice To make its lustre sure. My patient pen and heart, and mind, Shall seek this precious ore; Until like fashioned gold refined, It shines forth bright and pure! I know not why my poor muse wings Her jealous way to thee; And with impatience, ever sings Thy praises unto me. Thou art not beautiful, and yet, There is a grace divine, Serenely sweet, and deeply set In that fair face of thine. Thanks for thy friendship and thy praise, I'll prize them evermore; They'll cheer me through long, weary days, When other joys are o'er. A LOVE SONG. My love has gone to roam, Beyond the deep blue sea; But my kisses on his cheek Will bring him back to me. Although he is away, Far on a distant shore; He left his heart behind, With me forevermore! I feel the lingering glow Of his kisses even now; Like sunny beams of morn Upon my cheek and brow! Dear darling of my heart— Star of my blooming life; I've vow'd, on your return, To be your darling wife! THE MURDERED BRIDE. Far away in Balize there lived A Spanish-Indian maid; And fair was she to look upon, Her name was Adelaide. Coyish, and beautiful and meek, She was fair nature's child; Her eyes were black, her flowing hair Made her look strange and wild. But sadness dwelt upon her heart, Her mother long had died;— Her father led a hostile band, And the fierce arrow plied. Her life was sad, and yet at times, Hope brightened all her heart; And she would bid the silent woe From her poor heart depart. She loved a fair, young Englishman, Who roam'd upon the sea; And when he wrote her month by month, Her heart was full of glee. What dreams had she of blissful years Of rosy, wedded life! In twelve more moons, she was to be A happy bride and wife! How fair is life when love and hope, Together rule the heart; How fleet upon their fairy wings, Our thoughts to heaven start! But there are tears, and nights, and storms In life, as well as light; The heart that beams with joy to-day, To-morrow's storms may blight. Poor Adelaide! fair child of woe! Thy father long had sworn, That thy young pale-faced lover should Ne'er take thee for his own! The twelve moons pass'd; poor Adelaide, Her heart with true love burned, For on a fair and hopeful day, The Englishman returned. Her black eyes gleamed with hope and joy, She felt her heart rejoice; For months and years had come and gone, Since she had heard his voice. That night at the small village church, The priest had joined their hands; And they were bound, in two more days, To sail for other lands. But ere they reached their bridal home, That night, poor Adelaide, A ghastly, bloody, bridal corpse, Was by her father made! IN MAMA'S BED. Every morning she comes creeping, Little Mamie in her gown, From her little bed half sleeping, With her dreamy eyes cast down. “Mama, I am cold, please let me Come and sleep into your bed.” And, getting in, quite bold and free, Covers up her little head. Mama, with mock surprise out-cries— “What big girls is this, I pray, Who from her bed before sun rise, Gets up at the break of day?” And Mamie laughs, and creeping near, Gives mama the morning kiss! Now who can in this mortal sphere Measure this maternal bliss? O Father, at the final morn, Let my Mamie sleep with Thee! Let this sweet darling—my last born, In Thy courts an angel be! PARTED. We're parted now, and far apart we dwell, On the cold borders of this vale of tears, Yet oftentimes in a sweet dreamy spell, Your gentle form before my sight appears, With all the beauty and the power of grace, That once unmanned me in the bygone days; With the same eyes and happy sunlit face That won my love, my life, my sweetest praise! But soon is fled this mystic, dreamy spell, When memory opes her magic folding door; Again my thoughts on worldly misery dwell— Again I tread the desert as before. I steady walk life's rugged road alone, And try to drive thy image from my mind, With the sweet memories of days by gone, That still my heart and tender feelings bind! A VISIT TO MY NATIVE HOME. O, how I love to linger near, These scenes and ties of yore! They call up mem'ries sweet and dear To me forevermore! Here is the rustic house of logs, Hewn broad with axe and line; And steers, and cows, and mules, and dogs, And restless, nosing swine! And down below the cotton wood, The dear old river sweeps; While on its bank in solitude The flowing willow weeps. How oft upon its rippling wave I've swept with splashing oars, And gliding down, to fish and lave, Upon its pebbled shores! And yonder waves the golden field Of ripening wheat and corn; What cheerful hopes upon its yield And worth are daily born! Farewell, sweet native home again— Scenes of my boyhood's plays! Your ties and memories will remain The bright dream of my days! FREE CUBA. Hail free Cuba! Queen of the tropic sea, Thy long bound, toil-worn, sable sons are free! The fiat has gone forth, from sea to sea, That men, no longer slaves, but free shall be! It is the voice of Freedom's patient God, That man shall groan no more beneath the rod! The Cuban slaves have heard the swelling sound Of Freedom's hosts fast marching on the ground, Where late through fire and blood, with sword and gun, The glorious war for Liberty was won! March onward, glorious band, for equal rights, God makes man free when he for freedom fights! Cowards are always slaves, and have no share, In the sweet spoils of those who do and dare! Cuba is free! now let Brazil awake, From her vile bondage, and her fetters break! And join the northern chorus of the free, That swells from land to land and sea to sea! UNDER THE PINE AND PALM. Far from the city's din and strife, And from the scenes of busy life, I wander to the woodland bow'rs Where I may muse through pensive hours. Under the pine, under the palm, In sombre shadows soft and calm; The atmosphere, though charged with heat, Is filled with woodland odors sweet. Up in the boughs of verdant trees, Where sports the gentle fleetful breeze, The merry birds, with tiny throats, Chirp out their songs in sweetest notes. Fair Nature in her best array, Sits crowned, the floral Queen of May; The sunbeams on the vine-clad bow'rs, Descend in gentle, golden show'rs. Sweet May! forever fair and bright— For e'er ladened with sweet delight!— 'Tis thine to cheer our lonely hours, And deck this sunny land with flow'rs. Sweet summer land, forever green, With climate blissful and serene; No icy wind with chilling snows, Around thy fairy borders blows. O, arching pines with towering height, Grim watchers of the silent night!— Have ye no tales of wild romance To lure my soul in blissful trance? Perhaps beneath these very bow'rs, In by-gone happy days and hours, The warrior and the Indian maid, Sweet vows of lasting love have made. How pure and simple in the woods, Is love in all its varied moods: Its life, an endless summer day, With no dark clouds to foil its sway. But I must leave these sunny bow'rs, With their enchanted birds and flow'rs: These are but tastes to mortals given, Of that endless Spring in Heaven! ABSENCE. O what a dreary blank! how long These dragging months have been Since thou wert here with cheerful song, And with thy smile serene! Thy presence was my life, my joy— Thy voice was my delight, And how must I the time employ When thou art out of sight? I sigh in sadness all alone, In daytime and at eve; From out my heart the light is gone, And I in sorrow grieve. I sit, then walk from place to place, And dream of thee at night; And in my wearied mind I trace Thy features sweet and bright! O darling, come to me again! And cheer my heart once more,— Come in thy beauty and remain, And joy and life restore! FREDERICK DOUGLASS. From servile state to highest fame, This Nestor of the black race came. What a change, and wonderful span, For a fettered and slave-cursed man! Some call us an “inferior race,” And to the ape our lineage trace; But what man of a fairer hue Could ever this black man out-do? All honor to this Negro sage, Who on the Anti-Slavery stage, With other leaders of its foes, Dealt Slavery such deadly blows! Rejoice! for now at last behold, Thy race no longer bought and sold! Rest from thy work, and with joy see, Four millions of thy people free! “SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR.” “Thou art so far and yet so near,” By day and night to me; I've seen thee only twice this year, Although firm friends are we. And yet deep in thy woman's heart A chamber clean and pure To me is sacred; kept apart For our tried love of yore. O sacred chamber, Cupid's shrine, Art thou forever sealed? And shall those treasured gems of thine Be never more revealed? Ah, words were vain; our hearts and eyes A silent language knew; When thou, confused with tears and sighs, I to my bosom drew! My lips again may never press The hot tears on thy face; Nor I thy slender form caress In one long, fond embrace! Such luxuries of love belong Unto the faded past; But still for these dear sweets I long, E'en though apart we're cast. Then be not far when thou art near, But near my heart abide; There dream and hope, and do not fear, Although dark years betide! THE NEGRO'S LAMENT. How long, O God! how long must I remain Worse than an alien in my native land? For long years past I've toiled for other's gain Beneath Oppression's ruthless iron hand. Columbia! why art thou so great and fair, And so false and cruel to thine own? Goodness and Beauty, a proverbial pair, They in thy heritage, themselves disown. So fair and yet so false! thou art a lie Against both natural and human laws,— A deformed dwarf, dropp'd from an angry sky To serve a selfish, and unholy cause! Ye sun-kiss'd lakes and hills of Liberty! And silvery flowing streams and fields! Your teeming gold and grain are not for me, My birthright only ostracism yields! My life is burdensome; year suceeds year With feeble hope: I try to emulate All that conspire to ennoble manhood's sphere; And yet I seem to war with angry Fate! O Liberty! I taste but half thy sweets In this thy boasted land of Equal Rights! Although I've fought on land and in thy fleets Thy foes, by day and by dim camp-fire lights! What more wouldst have me do? Is not my life— My blood, an all-sufficient sacrifice? Wouldst thou have me transformed in the vain strife To change the fiat of the great Allwise? Of what avail is life—why sigh and fret, When manly hopes are only born to fade? Although declared a man, a vassal yet By social caste—a crime by heaven made! Far better for me not to have been born, Than live and feel the frownings of mankind; Endure its social hatred and its scorn, With all my blighting, forlorn hopes combined. O, cruel fate!—O, struggle which unmans, And burdens every hope and every sigh! Thou art a boundless gulf over which spans Only the arching, storm-foreboding sky! Ah, woe is me! I feel my yearnings crush'd Ere they are born within my sighing heart; All hopes, all manly aspirations hush'd As with the power of Death's fatal dart! The rice birds sing as if in mocking glee, Scorn my long felt sorrows and my burning tears, Why mock me, birds? I only crave to be Like you, free to roam the boundless spheres! But still sing on! your cheerful music gives My fading hope a gleam of brighter days; Why should I grieve? the eternal God still lives!— The sun still shines though clouds obscure his rays! The darkest hour is just before the break Of dawning victory of light and life, When Freedom's hosts with armor bright awake, To quell Oppression in the deadly strife! New hope is mine! for now I see the gleam Of beacon lights of coming liberty! A continent is shock'd—a crimson stream Of blood has paid the debt, and I am free! TO E. W. S. Thou art divinely tall and fair, And crowned with auburn, flaxen hair; A charming shape to thee was given By the presiding Fates of heaven! That witching mole upon thy cheek, Renders thy features sweet and meek; It is a witching charm and pet, That is in thy pale beauty set. That beauty from the southern clime, Beams on thy face with love sublime,— A southern jessamine thou art, For thou hast won my trusting heart! O could I win that heart of thine, And call it hence forever mine! I'd count my earthly sorrows o'er, And dream of bliss ferever more! A SONNET. [The Sun, upon the western sky] The Sun, upon the western sky, Has painted ev'ry cloud with gold; And now he shuts his fiery eye To sleep in his hesperian fold! And twilight with presumptuous Night, Are battling on the plain for sway; While in the dell, in sweet delight, The nightingale pipes out his lay. The new-born Moon, with silver sheen, Now seeks the gloomy earth to woo; While from the Stars, glad tears are seen To fall in crystal drops of dew, Into the cups of gay-eyed flow'rs, That sparkle bright from woodland bow'rs! THE ERRING. Down from the height of virtue's throne— Out on the world's cold sea! She glides, a sad, forsaken one, Once happy, proud and free. Love was her sin; too strong and well That passion swayed her heart; Its power ruled her life—she fell A victim to its dart. If “God is love” can love be sin On earth more than in Heaven? The flame that burned her heart within Was by her Saviour given. “She loved not wisely, but too well,” So says the world of pride; And with its scorn her sighs would quell, And her poor life deride. The Cross was for the fallen made— For these the Saviour died; And why heap burdens—why upbraid Their lives with mocking pride? Their lot is sad enough. No more Their darkened lives defame; Better to bid their sorrows o'er Than sink their hearts in shame. A gentle look—a tender word, May cheer the erring maid; And touch a secret, silent chord Of hope that may not fade. In solitude she sits alone, Wrapped up in grief and woe; The sunshine of her life is gone, Her lover too, also. Deep gloom is locked up in her soul, Her eyes are filled with tears; She sees the clouds of sorrow roll Over her future years. She hates herself the worst of all, Her love is still the same For him who brought her to her fall, And made her life a shame. Kind Father of the high and low— The fallen and the good; Look kindly on this child of woe In her dark solitude! Bring back the sunshine of her life, And once more make her bloom, That she may be a spirit wife Beyond the silent tomb! THE RETURN. I am come again to my native land! From the far off bounding sea— Once more to my own dear hills and dales, With a spirit light and free! Once more to my native scenes and skies— Once more to the loved ones home: Once more to my placid streams and lakes, I merrily, merrily come! Once more 'mid the din and clash of swords— 'Mid the roar of musketry! Where the daring sable warrior strikes For God and Liberty! Once more 'mid the flow of blood and tears— Where the cannon's iron voice, Speaks Freedom on the Southern plains, And makes the slave rejoice! Once more to my dark-eyed maiden-love, To make her red cheeks glow! Once more to the angel heart I won In days of long ago! IN MEMORIAM. [Died.—At Tallahassee, Fla., February 11, 1875, for want of thirty-nine votes, a band of patriots named Legion.] Oh who in story or in song Can tell the pangs of those who long For envied senatorial fame, Without the votes to get the same? What pen can write or language tell The sighs and woes of those who fell Prostrate and bleeding in the race, With “U. S. S.” stamped on their face? Ah, “thirty-nine,” immortal prize! That dazzled patriotic eyes; For thee they struggled, prayed and sighed, For thee they fought and lost and died! Take them up—no; let them repose, Peacefully from their crushing woes; Let their friends send off the story That they died in sight of glory! “Well, such is life:” to-day we bloom, To-morrow we are wrapped in gloom: Now you have it—it looks so fine— Now you don't, 'twas all moonshine! CENTENNIAL HYMN. O silent harp! awake and greet Freedom's Centennial morn, With thrilling numbers soft and sweet And melodies new born! Safe from despotic thrones we sing Sweet anthems of the free; We pray in peace, and fear no King Beyond the surging sea! Thank God for Puritanic zeal, On freedom's virgin sod, That bravely sought, in woe or weal, “Freedom to worship God!” Thanks for the faith that would not yield, Nor shrink at death's alarm; God was its hope and prayer its shield, And truth its secret charm! Calmly beneath the western skies, Young freedom sighs no more; For he is stout and loud defies The tyrant's rule of yore! On every hill—on every plain, His rustic throne is seen; The yeomen form his regal train— The milkmaid is his queen! Equality of rights and laws— Equality of birth; These are the glories of our cause, The treasures of our worth. These are the golden fruits enjoyed— A century's first yield; From patient, rugged hands employed In freedom's martial field! O let these ties unite again, Our sections near and far; And gently lure them to refrain From the dread work of war. Then tuneful harp, with pride repeat The dear Centennial joy; With thrilling numbers soft and sweet, Thy highest notes employ! ON THE DEATH OF WM. LLOYD GARRISON. At last thy sword is sheathed, O Garrison! Brave warrior for the trampled Right! Though dead, thy voice is ever marching on Where Right is fettered under Might! Mellow with age, with honors laden bright, Thou hast pass'd from the world's great strife: Through the wrongs and crimes of Oppression's night, To the gates of a peaceful life! To-day five million hearts in sorrow grieve— Five million voices sing thy praise; For with thy sword their fetters thou didst cleave, And numbered Slavery's bloody days! To-day let Liberty's fair face be bowed, And let her banners bright be furled; For her brave giant in his grave is lowered, Who braved the darts that slavery hurled! Thy work on earth, O Garrison, was done, Like righteous Simeon of old; Thy eyes did see our Freedom's battle won, And Man no longer bought and sold! All honor to thy name, O Garrison! And the brave ones who with thee fought,— Forten, Purvis, Tappan, and bold Thompson, Phillips, Douglass, Lucretia Mott! Thou art gone to thy rest, no more to flee, From a vile Philadelphia mob: No more to plead for the slave to be free From those who his labor did rob! The slave is free! thou didst not plead in vain! For God is ever with the Right; And those who trade in human souls for gain, Are doomed to fall before His might! Rest from thy labors in thy honored grave, While prayers ascend to Freedom's God; His glory has been seen, and now the slave No longer groans beneath the rod! I DARE NOT TELL THEE. I dare not tell thee how thy stately form Sweeps with majestic grace; Divinely beautiful, with magic charm, Before my pensive face. I dare not tell thee how thy modest eyes, Illume my inmost heart; And draw from it such secret, hopeless sighs, As make its fibers smart. I dare not tell thee all I think and feel, Nor all I dream of thee; All this is sacred; nor must I reveal How dear thou art to me! I dare not tell thee how I crave to be Thy chosen, favored friend; To share thy great, warm heart, so large and free, Its thoughts to comprehend! To rule supreme o'er such a heart as thine, And call thee “darling wife!” What king or poet who would not enshrine Thee in his heart for life! Such thoughts and dreams as these alone belong Unto a poet's mind; To be rehearsed in his impassioned song, Of love and womankind! There is enthroned high on thy queenly brow, A charm divinely sweet; Before whose power man must ever bow In homage at thy feet! My heart is prisoned; I must say no more Until thy smile I greet, I pray thee do not chide my muse before We at the church-door meet! AUTUMN. A glimmering haze upon the landscape rests; The sky has on a softer robe of blue; And the slant sunbeams glisten mildly through The floating clouds, that light their pearly crests Mid the pure currents of the upper air. The fields are dressed in Autumn's faded green, And trees no more their clustering foliage wear; Yet Nature smiles, all lovely and serene. How sweetly breaths this life-inspiring gale, Stirring broad Potomac's transparent wave; Could I but dream that Winter, cold and pale, Might never o'er this scene of beauty rave, Or touch the waters with his icy spear,— O, would these golden hours be half so dear? THE SOLID SOUTH. The monster, Treason, still survives! And in the South domain, The Negroes, trembling for their lives, For justice plead in vain! How long, O God of truth, how long, Shall those vile gangs abound, And with their guns, in numbers strong, Shoot Negroes to the ground? All o'er the South's fair sunny clime, Is heard the rebel yell, Where through the war, in manly prime, The Union soldier fell. The North was fooled, too soon the strife Was closed, and pardon given, To those who on the Nation's life In bloody war had striven. But see! the solid North arrayed In glory and in might; And like a giant, undismayed, Again renews the fight! It thunders from the Northern lakes— It is the voice of God! The giant tramp of Freedom shakes The loyal Northern sod! Let Treason and its hordes beware, Lest Freedom's hosts again, With sword, and shot, and shell, lay bare Its unsubdued domain! TO A LADY FRIEND. Fair lady, minstrel of the heart, With regal, winsome ways And fairy fingers that impart The power of magic lays, 'Tis thine with tender notes to stir The heart's most secret spring, And be its soft interpreter, And all its yearnings sing. 'Tis thine to touch with magic hands, The keys of sweet delight, And waft the soul to fairy lands, In heavenly regions bright. A power divine belongs to thee To please and melt the heart, And bid with potent melody All its rude cares depart! In silent joy my soul once fed Upon thy numbers sweet; Their charm, though weary days have fled, Still holds my heart complete. GOOD-BYE! OFF FOR KANSAS. Good-bye ye bloody scenes of long ago!— Good-bye to cotton fields and hounds! From you, vile sources of my earthly woe, My freed and leaping spirit bounds! Though free, my work to me no profit yields, And for my politics, am mobb'd; No more thank God! upon these bloody fields Shall I be of my labor robb'd! Good-bye Aunt Polly! good-bye Uncle Ned! I am off, and shall not come back; This land is cursed; we are in rags, half fed, Bull-dosed and killed by Yellow Jack! Good-bye! I've sold my little cane and corn! And am off for the river's banks; And when I step on board to-morrow morn, I'll sing and give the good Lord thanks! TO LUCY. Lucy, push your veil aside, When you pass my store; Let me see those eyes you hide, Then I'll love you more! Dreamy eyes and chubby face, Let me see you more; Full of love and life and grace! When you pass my store! How I watch to see you pass, With your graceful mien; Gliding like a young school lass Of joyous seventeen! If you love me not, then why Do you pass this way? Don't you know you make me sigh With your form so gay? LINES WRITTEN IN “PET'S” ALBUM. O, Mary, you have ruled too long O'er prostrate, bleeding hearts; Lay by your scepter; why prolong Your sway with Cupid's darts? Brave Hymen with extended arms Your long delay upbraids; Yield to his care your queenly charms Before your beauty fades! OUR DISTRICT SCHOOL TEACHERS. What shall I write or say, About this noble band, Who toil from day to day, With eyes, and heart, and hand? The care and toil and woes, From morn till coming eve, A teacher undergoes, No one else can conceive. A noisy mob of brats, One good to twenty bad, With toys and strings and hats, Enough to send one mad! The teachers' hell is here— Their heaven is above The whispering atmosphere, Through which they daily move! And yet with all this care, They still are bright and sane— They smile at grim despair, And their good looks retain! God bless you one and all! And may the day soon come, When Cupid's voice shall call You all to Hymen's home! ACROSTIC. Majestic one! with regal form and mien, A modern type thou art of Egypt's queen: Robust and tall, and crowned with raven hair, You are my ideal of a woman fair! For many years thy form has seem'd to me Replete with beauty and nobility: Awakening hopes and dreams, only to fade 'Neath the dark wing of Fate's desponding shade. Cannot some pleasant memories of yore Enter thy heart, and thoughts of me restore? Send them not back, they were in friendship made! Kindle anew the friendship of the past, If in thy heart a spark of it be left; Grant me this boon, its memory will last Evermore undimm'd, till I of life be reft, Respond to father Gabriel's final blast! PHILLIS WHEATLEY. From out the gloom and shade of years— From out the vault of time; O, Phillis, fill these lowly spheres With thy sweet notes sublime! Thy silent harp, O strike again, Upon the Unknown Shore, That I may catch the sweet refrain And sing thy numbers o'er! Celestial fire to thee was given To move the heart to tears, And lull, with melting notes of heaven, Its yearnings and its fears! Too soon thy tuneful harp was hush'd By death's relentless dart; Too soon thy fairy hopes were crush'd Within thy singing heart. Dear Phillis, let me write thy name Into immortal song; So that thy worth and glowing fame May be remembered long. I've never seen thy pensive face, Nor heard thy cheerful voice; And yet through Fancy's dream I trace The Muse's sable choice. I love the sweetness of thy song, And hold thy memory dear; Thy genius and thy fame belong To Negroes far and near. TO M. E. T. ACROSTIC. My dear, new friend, with features fair, And sparkling eyes and waving hair, Rude Care has not yet touched thy face, To mar its sweetness and its grace. He was a fool to turn his heart Against such creature as thou art! Thy baited smile again throw out, Until the right one comes about! Conquest is for the fair, like you, Kind-hearted creatures, good and true. Enslaved I am, or else my heart, Resistless to thy shrine would start! TO SUSIE. Through the depths of thy tender eyes, I read thy girlish heart; And through thy silent, broken sighs. Its words to me impart. O, silent spell! how sweet the charm, When words are out of place!— When thy dear head is on my arm, And I thy features trace! O then, I seem to soar above, In some immortal sphere; Where dwell eternal joy and love, And life's cares disappear! Then let me here forever stay— Forever by thy side; Where life is one eternal day, And thou, my joy and pride! ADIEU! My task is done; go, gentle book, With all my hopes and fears: Go win a smile, a sigh, a look— Perhaps a heart and tears! Take rosy hope, and love, and joy, Upon thy fairy wing; The lovers' leisure hours employ, And to their passions sing! Thou hast a word for young and old— The beautiful and good; The sunny beams within thy fold, Will be Love's dainty food!</field>
