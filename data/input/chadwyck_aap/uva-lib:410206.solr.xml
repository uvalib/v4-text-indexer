      <field name="fulltext">Let me always dwell on life's highway and be the children's friend. CHUMS When He called little children as lambs to His fold. I should like to have been there then. I wish that His arms had been thrown around me. That His hands had been placed on my head, And that I might have seen His kind look when He said, âLet the little ones come unto Me.â Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go And ask for a share of His love, And if I now earnestly seek Him below, I shall see Him and hear Him above. DEDICATEDâ To the memory of That angelic woman Who claimed me as her son; Of that majestic woman Whose race on earth was run Long ere I was old enough To reason right from wrong, Long before I listened to Redemption's saving song. To the conscience of the nation With the hopes that it may rise To the point of elevation That will open up its eyes, And lend to us a listening ear For the pitiful tale of woe That Ajax The latter part of this book will explain who Ajax is. cannot sleep at night For lynchers are aglow. They burn poor Ajax at the stake, They hang him to a tree, They chop him up like sausage meat, From home they make him flee. PREAMBLEâ Sweet innocence of childhood is now on the decay, Refined women's modesty has wandered far away. The home is no longer a sacred retreat, For the head and the heart have gone to the feet. The church has forsaken the âthou shalt not's,â But says, âSuch is life.â If not, why not? Society is rotten from surface to core, To speak of reforming brings a shouting uproar. Our national Congress has gone to the dogs. No statesmen, no juristsâall political frauds. No men of conviction, no men who delight In asking their conscience what is right, And then with a purpose, firm and strong, To follow that conscience against all wrong. Our nation is crumbling right over the brink That caused Rome's downfall to a bottomless sink. Now who will be here to write such a history? Ah! my dear comrades, that is the mystery. Agnostics say bring the Bible down to the people Instead of lifting the race to the Bible's high steeple. Let me drop you this candid thought in a plain and positive tone: Let's elevate the masses; better let that Bible alone. O God! give us a little faith, and into this darkness That's growing darker every day, Oh! send a ray of rest. All hopes deal with the future, Lord, we hope for a better day; As we drift down with the tide, guide us the right way. WHY I do not write to please but, in writing the truth, hope to please. A single fact is worth a shipload of argument. It hurts us to admit facts. Truth is usually disagreeable and unpleasant but it is the truth just the same. If my language is strong, it is not from a desire to depart from the landmark of polite literature but simply to drive the truth home. If you think the statement of some of the facts are horrible, think how much more horrible is the reality and how essential that something should be done. Shrewer, the great German artist, once painted a chimney sweep. You wouldn't allow the chimney sweep in your back yard but so perfect was the drawing that A. T. Stewart of New York gave him 40,000 for it. Kraust, the great animal painter of Russia, drew an old mule, just a common mule eating hay, then right beside it he drew the comical side of that mule with his ears way above the tree tops with chickens roosting on them. That old mule on the market would hardly draw 35.00, but so perfect was the work that the national museum gave him 37,000 for it. That's what art will do. Dickens went down in the low, dirty slums of London, got those filthy characters, put them in book form, and now we sit down in our parlor and read the work of Dickens, and most of our schools adopt it as literature. Shakespeare went among the criminal class of Europe, selected the darkest crimes of the continent, and today we rush out to see Shakespeare's plays. But it was not that old chimney sweep, nor the old mule, nor the slum characters, nor the criminals of Europe, but it was the truth painted on canvas and the truth written in book form. When you find men like Shrewer and Kraust who can paint the truth and men like Shakespeare and Dickens who can write the truth, there is nothing that can upset them. Some may ask, why speak of these things; why shock the modesty of the blushing lass or check the career of the boundless youth; why not dwell upon things more pleasing to the eye and appetite of this generation? As well might you ask, âWhy give the alarm when the house in which you are sleeping is on fire? Why cry aloud when the ship on which you are sailing has sprung a leak? Why wave the red flag when the train on which you are riding is rushing on to destruction?â Have you ever stopped to think of the sanctity of our homes, the sacredness of our schools and churches and society, and how immorality, like a canker worm, is eating out the very foundations of these divine institutions? Then ask me not why, everything of account in the world has to be cared for and protected. We work nine months to plant, cultivate, and gather a garden crop while weeds and dog fennel sown by accident and cultivated by chance will grow on the common highway, and the weeds, if neglected on the street side of the fence, will soon be growing in the garden. In fighting the child's battle, who cannot fight for himself, our work is never over. We are using this world for a playground instead of a schoolroom. We are making life a holiday instead of a workshop. We are keeping time and step with the music instead of the world facts and events. We have not yet reached that stage in life where we can appreciate genuine manhood and depreciate its defects. We endorse crime by supporting criminals and encouraging dirt by supporting dirty men. The church no longer shrieks the important âthou shalt notâ to certain evils, but simply points out the way and says, âbe careful,â and a little later on they say, âit's too bad,â or âsuch is life.â Break the ten commandments, break all the rules of the church and decent society, but get that almighty dollar and pay your church dues and you are in good standing with the church and society. Because sin dresses well, looks nice, and acts so, it is not recognized as sin but is welcomed into the church and home, then we sit and sigh and often wonder why the rising generation is not any better. We need to be educated half way 'round the globe till we can cease to look upon that as the greatest good which is of the least importance. As you read this book, remember that I am fighting the child's battle, who cannot fight for himself. Children are malleable; grown-ups are immalleable. As this generation is made up of folks with habits fixed for life, I am transferring my effects toward the interest of the next generation. If I can drop a thought, advance an idea, or do an act that will benefit the next generation, I will feel repaid. Germany and Japan, the worst enemies to Christian civilization, started forty years ago to train their children for the conflict just ended. Let us constantly ask ourselves the question, âIs the child safe?â [These children make a thoughtless dash] These children make a thoughtless dash 'Pon life's uncertain stage; The program is left with us In which they will engage. These children pull life's curtain back. What sights will meet their gaze? That depends upon you and I, Our sayings, doings, ways. LET ME LIVEâ The hermit can't stand life's bright highway, He seeks a secluded spot; The sluggard is content to let life slip away While he sits by and rots; The genius, who has solved the ages' riddle, Inquires, âIs life worth living?â But I want to dwell in the midst of children, And breathe pure life thanksgivings. I want my house on life's highway Where the children all pass by; Children that are goodâchildren badâ As good and bad as I. I would strengthen the conscience of children good, The bad I would try to reform; Let me live somewhere besides life's road And protect the children from harm. I want my house on life's highway Where the child's awakening love Charges, sustains, dissolves, creates, Permeates and broods above. Thus strengthened in life's great struggling sphere, No coward soul would be mine, For the child's love, arming me from fear, Would make life's work sublime. Could the centripetal forces ever triumph, And the centrifugal forces yield, And earth, moon, and stars would go shining in a lump Through a disastrous human field; But the acid counterbalances and keeps in touch, And positive and negative form. Let me always dwell in the children's camp, And let be that acid strong. I want my house on life's high hill In sight of the gambler's den, With the snares and traps that the wicked build To entice the young mind in. I would clear the road of all stumbling blocks Such as the wicked sayings of men. Let me live somewhere in the human flock And be the children's friend. I'd like to have seen Moses in the flesh And stood upon Mar's Hill with Paul; And to have witnessed Rome in her height Would have helped me in life's noble cause. But I read somewhere, in a worn out book, Where these men's deeds were told. And they all fade away when the child stampede Beleaguered the human soul. So let me live right close to life's highway Where the children stroll along, Where I can breathe the youthful atmosphere And sing the children's song. I like to see them romp and play And hark to their lullabys. Let me always dwell on life's highway Where the children all pass by. If I could build a building like this And call it my very own, I would fill it full of human bliss And make it a children's home. I would build the walls so high, so strong That old Satan couldn't get in. Let me always dwell in the human throng And be the children's friend. I think when I read that sweet story of old, When Jesus was here among men, When He called little children as lambs to His fold, I'd like to have been with them then. LOVE THE CHILDRENâ Love the children, Never doubt them. Build a wall Of love about them. Love the children And remember, May is not like Cold December. Love the children, Just as He did, Who so nobly, Humbly pleaded, âSuffer them to Come unto Me, Forbid them not,â Pleaded He. But I've always Loved the jewel, Always the thought That it was cruel To effect their Youthful beauty. It has been a lifetime duty. Love the children, Never doubt them. Build a wall of Love about them. PHYLLIS WHEATLEYâ Phyllis Wheatley, a naked, savage child, Then a slave for twelve long years; Then a scholar, poetess, then national fame. Then immortal in the woman's sphere. HARRIET BEECHER STOWEâ That grand and noble woman dear, Called Harriet Beecher Stowe: The book she wrote without a fear Drove slavery from our shore. To know her words, to feel her worth, To read that noble book, And see what dauntless words she spoke, What fearful risks she took. EARTHLY ANGELSâ When I'm thinking of my Saviour, When I'm seeking good behavior, When I look for earthly angels, Then I with children mingle. When that gener'l role is thundered, If among the saints I'm numbered, I'm going to search that place of honor Till I find the children's corner. Then when I find itâI'm going to tell Whole lots of angels to ring those bells; When the bells start ringing, I'll just tell 'em We children're going to strut all over God's heaven. FACTSâ Do You Know Thatâ Deep in each artist's soul some picture lies That he will never paint for mortal eyes? And every author in his heart doth hold Some sad, sweet tale that he will leave untold? Besides Thatâ There are poems unwritten and songs unsung Sweeter than any that ever was heard; Poems that will wait for an angel's tongue, Songs that wait for a paradise bird. And Thenâ I don't believe that a song is sung But the singer's heart sings sweeter. I don't believe a rhyme can be rung But the thought surpasses the meter. I don't believe that a painter's stroke Can draw what the heart to conscience spoke. But My Friendsâ The kind of man for you and me Faces the world unflinchingly And smites, as long as wrong resists, With knuckled faith and force-like fists. He lives the life he is preaching of, And loves where most there is need of love. And feeling still, with a faith half clad, That the bad are as good as the good are bad, He strikes right out for the right, and he Is the kind of a man for you and me. If you can't take a stand for right, And hold your own in the thickest fight, And in that way prevent human strife, Stay off the frontier of public life! TWO CHILDRENâ I saw two small children entwine Their arms about each other Like the little tendrils of the vine Around its nearest brother; And ever and anon, So gayly they ran on, Each looked into the other's face Anticipating an embrace. And all my thoughts went with the pair. I ran my fingers through my hair And wished I had a child's embrace. They're undefiledâand not debase. Innocent child and snow-white flower, Well are you paired in your opening hour, Thus should the pure and the lovely meet: Stainless with stainless and sweet with sweet. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?â As you travel along life's highway, Are you going up or down? Or are you simply standing still, And going 'round and 'round? Are you helping move the wheel Of human progress up and on? If not, are you of service or as Obstruction to the throng? If you've never helped a brother With his struggles and his strife, If you've never made another Have a happier time in life, If you've never been consoling To the weary, sick and worn, Of what service are you In this lovely land of morn? If you've never made a comrade Feel the world's a better place Because you've lived within it And had served it with a grace? If you've never heard a woman Or a little child proclaim A blessing on your doings, You're a poor hand at the game. If you've never made the pathway Of some neighbor glow with sun, If you've never dropped a bubble To some youngster's heart with fun, If you've never cheered a toiler That you've helped to get alongâ Won't you tell me what you're here for In this lovely land of song? If you see a woman smoking, Drinking, wallowing in the gutter, Detrimental to posterity, Especially one who's a mother, Have you the moral courage To induce her to come up, Or do you fear the hissing crowd? If so, you are corrupt. If you should see a helpless child Just going to destruction, And it's within your power To move the main obstruction Would you remove that stumbling block To save the children's pride? Or would you rather have the world's applause? If so, go off and hide! Man conquered the sea and land And now has grasped the air; He concentrates them to his will But not for man's welfare. He uses all research of science To perfect hellish wars, To butcher his fellowman And annihilate God's cause. Man travels far above the clouds, With silvery airplane bright. He challenges the eagle and O'ertakes him in his flight. But those are but man's trifles, Man's victories in speed; While justice, peace and liberty Are still the world's great needs. Man paints his own pictures, Man prints his own books, But his blood doesn't circulate By his own whines and hooks. Our God gave man his limitâ So far and no farther; He knows man would use it For his own earthly barter. Should Japan reach her final goal To unite all darker races, To present a solid phalanx front To heal all past disgraces, And when she asks us Americans, âFriends, what have you to offer?â We'll gasp like some dumb, driven beast And Japan would be the scoffer. The cause of education Once had as its great goal The education of the heart, The head, the hand, the soul; But now it's concentrating All its forces in the feet, And âLook up, lift up,â has no voice, The underworld has beat. The grand old church once lowered its gap In compromise with the world, And now she's torn all fences down And joined in with the twirl. The devil, he's just tickled; How he sears the hearts of men, How he rules the entire nation With his wicked, lustful sin. Are you denouncing all that's wrong And advocating right, To teach our youth to âLook up, lift up,â Give the world more light? Can you be sympathetic When the human heart throb sighs? If not, why don't you step aside And let the world go by? Oh! when that general roll is called, What's going to be your answer When Peter asks what you've opposed And what things you have sanctioned? And as you view those pearly gates And those bright mansions of mirth, Conscience will put the questionâ What's your record while on earth? RETRIBUTIONâ God counts the Negro's tears. I caution you, be careful, then, Judges, jurors, brutes and men, Be careful and assuage his fears And protect him through the years. Before God's throne the pearls you'll lay, He'll count them on the Judgment Day. And he who tally keeps will hear The echoes of the deadening years. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. When slavery's horrors reached midnight, All consciousness had taken flight, Human brutality had no fear, Cruelty stood out as human peer. God called Abe Lincoln upon the stage To show the depth of this outrage. He stood amidst their threats and jeers, And poured plain justice in their ears. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. The Ku Klux Klan took charge of state. Again it was the Negro's fate. This low black spot of great despair Made ancient cruelties lift their hair. This reached the lowest stage for years, With cruelty beyond compare, Till God, with pestilent disease, Scattered the Ku Klux Klan like wintry leaves. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. Ye lynchers with your bloodiest page That shocked the Russians' cruel outrage, You stand on cruelty's page as peers, Your civilization is veneered. And worst of all since God's creation, The lowest depths of degradation, Fished from the foulest beast, my dear, With lynchers' crime will not compare. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. Five hundred strong, the low mob rage, Takes one poor Negro off the stage. Innocence lynched 'midst shouts and cheers. The helpless community stands by in fear. With one cyclone God sweeps a town, Auto and train wrecks mow men down. The flu comes along, makes millions sneeze, The war brings nations to their knees. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. O white man, have you any heart? And did your senses ever start? Have you no scruples, can you hear The wails and cries and yet forbear? I caution you, this lynching bee And Ku Klux Klan you'll surely see. I caution you, be careful, then, Judges, jurors, brutes and men. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. For many years he cried for aid, America's conscience all seemed stayed. His punishment has vanished fear, These race riots reveal the bier. In East St. Louis some truths were told, Washington and Chicago increased the fold, Then Omaha applied the spear, And Tulsa quieted all their jeers. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. God's rules of fifty centuries ago Are still in vogue, are still aglow. When a man sows in the natural field, A harvest it is expected to yield. The process may be somewhat slow, But you are to reap just what you sow. They used to lynch their poor black brother, But now they're lynching one another. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. I caution you, just watch the tide On which the Exodus doth ride Into a purer, higher sphere Where men are men and brutes are jeered. The fields are growing up in weeds, Revealing all past wicked deeds. The Negro left his southern fear All wrapped up in his vanished gear. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. At home he has no chance at all, But sometimes otherwise he's called. With Roosevelt on San Juan Hill, He took that Fort 'midst shouts and thrills. And on that noted Hindenburg line He joined the French in the nick of time, And picked up the motto âThey shall not pass,â And mowed down Germans until the last. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. Dixon and Mencken, like heartless beasts, In search of literary feasts, Are using vitriol's pen undilute To paint the Negro as a brute; But the interracial group at work No God-sent duty dares to shirk, Are striving to place upon the mart That beneath that black skin dwells a heart. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. Right now in the midst of all this drought The good white women of the South Are sending appeals to men of state, That lynching they must exterminate. And when a bunch of women vow, Mr. Weak-kneed man can only bow. I see that lynching is doomed to fall, By the women's handwriting on the wall. God counts the Negro's tears. God counts the Negro's tears. This country cannot see its flaws. The white men make and break the laws. The Negro waits for revolution, But God's on highâwatch retribution. Did you catch the trend of the last election, Have you given it a serious reflection? The âsolid Southâ was torn asunder, The Democratic Party scattered like plunder. God counts the Negro's tears. WOMANâ Once a woman tried to show me something spotless, bright and pure; And she picked for illustration objects of the dirtiest hue. âLady,â said I, eager, anxious, âwhy do you choose things so vile?â âJust to show the cleansing process,â said the lady with a smile. Then she said, âThese dirtiest colors, hardest to remove of all, Can be made, by constant rubbing, white as snowflakes in their fall.â These words struck my soul with power, made my heart within me throb, âDirtiest colorsâwhite as snowflakes,â can this woman, cannot God? Some noble, stalwart woman has, in every time and place, Wielded influence good or bad upon the human race. For when a woman makes a vow that she will do a thing, She's sure to win, or else she'll make opponent's conscience ring. And it is true as night and day that women of all nations Have moulded influence of the world that built up civilization. Few men of crime can stand to break a woman's heartâperchance, Some nations changed their Ship of State upon a woman's glance. Fair Helen sealed the fate of Troy, and queens of ancient times Have led brave hearts in cause of truth and made the wrong decline. Old Satan lifted up his form six thousand years ago, And started out for doing wrongâand all things right deplore. He has stalked across the nations, in every land and sea, And ever since creation he has had his timely plea. Sometimes nations, sometimes empires, have been kneeling at his shrine, But his individual efforts are as old and long as time. He first entreated Adam whom the Lord made like Himself, Tried to make him bite the apple, break the laws his Lord had left. Finding Adam fixed in purpose, he confronted noble Eve, Whose heart he was surely certain he could tangle and deceive. Noble Eve, like most good women, fascinated with a speech, Took it all in sacred omen and toward the apple reached. Well, she bit itâthen she passed it to her helpmate by her side. And his bite to please the woman placed us in a sinful tide. He took the heart of Samson's wife and stopped its pulsing beat, And made her take her husband's life by womanly deceit. He could not shake good, patient Job. He took his weakly wife, And used her as a culprit probe to culminate his life. And Lot's wife, on a mission bent, he brought her to a halt. She never reached her destined end. He turned her into salt. But the greatest gift in the Bible, so our Saviour did recite, Was that simple little token that we call the widow's mite. And the strongest tie of woman's faith that could not be concealedâ âLet me touch the hem of His garment and I know that I'll be healed.â Then, when our Lord was crucified and placed within the tomb, A woman was the last to leave that sacred place of gloom. And on the resurrection morn, while gloom was yet abroad, A woman broke the first glad news that âWe have seen the Lord.â Joan of Arc, with an army large and electrified woman's glance, Routed England's mighty army and saved the day for France. Queen Victoria brought England through her greatest revolutions. By teaching her that sacred homes were God-sent institutions. Her reign was long and prosperous. Her subjects were her crowns. She won the love of Europe and died in great renown. It was a woman's iron will baked by motherly love That entreated all authorities, then appealed to God above, Then climbed the belfry steep and high and grasped the clapper tight, And vowed with all her inner soul âCurfew shall not ring tonight.â She struck a blow to slavery's tree that burned its very life, That scorched the undergrowth around and left it in a strife. It parched the branches to a crust, withered its leaves in twain, And drove the sap into the ground, never to rise again. She stood nearer the throne of God than all false priests before, And turned the searchlight on to show the heartaches and the woes. The âBattle Hymn of the Republicâ by the noted Julia Ward Howe, Aroused this entire nation, and made proud soldiers bow. Sojourner Truth twice sold as a slave, undaunted by the wicked throng, Cried out to Lincoln in his darkest hours, âGod is not deadâmarch on!â Frances Willard, with her strong band, brought temperance to its goal, And counted her work as not in vain if she'd saved one dear soul. The women, struggling forty years, drove whiskey from our states, And asked the men in Congress to keep watch at the gates. But the men with dirty politics just messed up the whole field, And sent the nation frantically out calling for repeal. Then Frances Harper, of our own race, with power inspired from above, With lucid voice and pen of grace, filled up with hope and love, Woke the dear pulse of joy supreme in our discouraged hearts; Dispelled the long elusive dream, made new ambitions start. Then Anna Julia Cooper 'rose, in her âVoice from the South,â And struck prejudice a mighty blow and gave to wrong a drought. She wrote strong words and tried to strike the conscience of the nation, To see that all men are alike and have been since creation. Could Ida Wells have raised a force to follow her crusade, This dreadful crime called lynching, long in darkness would be laid. Then comes Jane Addams of Hull House fame, a political and social reformer; She went into the streets and alleys as a wayward girl reformer. Correction and charities filled her heart as she went forth to battleâ The spirit of growthâthe city streets, with new conscience as a chattel. She asked the men of her town to clean up the city. They said sarcastically, âClean it yourself.â She cleaned it and made them jittery. The greatest woman of modern times, of world-wide high distinction, Gave to the world in time of need the immortal Abraham Lincoln. Another one of great renown gave us a noble pearl, By bringing forth an Edison to electrify the world. Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, a Florida country school teacher, Then builded a famous college; is now a national figure. But the greatest woman in the mart, ask any sister or brother, The echo'd come from every heartâthat woman's name is Mother. THE NEW WOMANâ The woman are wearing britches now; You can't tell one from the other. She's tumbled down from her lofty throne To man, down in the gutter. There she's smoking, drinking, gambling, The world stands aghast, chagrined, The human race is turning backward, And is on the downward trend. The winding circle of cigar's smoke Doesn't measure the height of manhood's yoke, Nor can a filthy cigarette butt Elevate a woman out of the rut. Woman, who's upheld the moral code During all the centuries past, Has turned things topsy turvy, And the world stands by aghast. The child is born from a cigarette body, Its first caresses from a lip soaked tardy. As goes woman, so go morals. Where is the race to get its laurels? Oh! If I had a voice, a persuasive voice, I'd penetrate the heart of woman And show her how this moral world Is hanging now upon her omen. O woman, have you any heart, And did you ever sigh? And did your senses ever start At the future's wailing cry? O woman, won't you help us To pray to your Almighty God To help remove this stumbling block Ere we it all absorb? O woman, just for childhood's sake With one good hearty throb, Won't you help us pray one prayer To your Almighty God? O God! give us a little faith, And into this darkness That's getting deeper every day, Oh, send a light of rest! All hopes deal with the future, Lord, We hope for better days, And while we're drifting down the tide, Show us the right way. Laurels of this world are sweet, But they soon pass away. The child's laurels are dark right now. Can't we brighten the forthcoming days? HUMAN DRIFTWOODâ You have asked me to write a poem, I suppose on the way the world's going; Naturally you'd expect me, without any guile, To speak in defense of the helpless child. The child with a doll and toys that rattle, The child not able to fight its own battles, The child that mother's neglecting today, And school teacher's 'lowing its morals to sway, The child the church doesn't take in accord, 'Cause the preacher is busy after worldly rewards, The child that's today being led by the hand, But tomorrow its service will be in demand. Could Douglass and Lincoln step back to earth And catch a glimpse of our present mirth, They'd hang their heads in blushing shame Uttering âOur blood was shed in vain.â According to every indication, We sadly need re-emancipation. Emancipation from the traits and twirls That resemble the life of the underworld. The frivolous, giddy and silly today Have put real life in deep dismay. Society is driftwood on the sea Moved by the wave of the wicked glee. And this little town has gone plum wild Over the vulgar dance in all its beguile. Today it's a part of our education As well as the depth of degradation. You've seen a restless horse in a prance: That's this town in its vicious dance. The dance itself may not be so bad, But its avenue to wreckage is sad. Today life's a hop, a skip and a jump From the dancing den to the human dump It's been a downfall and a curse To millions, and is growing worse. 'Twas the life of the giddy Hottentots And the Indians in their war-hoop hops. Intelligent people in those days Found amusement in much higher ways. They used to dance to keep in style, But now they're dancing by the mile. They used to dance till near midnight, But now they dance till broad daylight. They dance all day, they dance all night, Till dancing has become a fright. In order to dance the church into hell They start on Sunday night at twelve. But the most disgusting thing of allâ They now give Sunday morning balls. They've taken the sacred Easter name And danced it into disgraceful shame. If Christ'd come here in search of bread, They'd dance the thorns down on His head, And as the blood'd ooze down His face, They'd dance on in their wild disgrace. And if He'd ask âWhy all of this?â They'd give Him a twentieth-century hiss. They've danced till when they go to church, They have a headacheâbeing still so much. They've danced the church into disrepute And dare the preacher to refute. They've danced the preacher into gambling dens, And now when they preachâthere are no sins. They've danced the church and Sunday schools To the muddy summer swimming pools. They've danced the young people's Sunday meet Out to the road house all complete. They've danced around the fireside Until the home has lost its pride. They've danced our homes into gambling dens, And whoopee joints for women and men. The child's disturbed in its midnight slumbers By shuffling cards and ball room plunder. And instead of rising 'midst morning prayers It's picking up rubbish from all-night affairs. The child learns to handle a deck of cards Before it learns the name of God. And ere a child learns to walk erect, It knows all the jazz of disrespect. Before a child gets into its teens, It's in these halls with dancing fiends. If you ask the mother, âWhy such a fate?â âI want my child to be up-to-date.â Up-to-date with the underworld, And a disgrace to all life's finer pearls. They've danced all our secret orders Out of existenceâask the recorders. They've danced their dresses up to their knees. They've danced until they have no sleeves. And if you'd promise not to scoff, Some of 'em'd dance their dresses off. They've danced pink stockings up to their waists, All visible, but it's no disgrace. They've danced until, well, I suppose, They think it useless to be in clothes. They've danced to the half a garment age Like the heart and freak of the old stone age. And this is morality and self respect! O God! bring the stone age back on deck. They've danced until the opposite sex For genuine woman has no respect. They've danced till even womankind Has caused her self respect to decline. They've danced till they have no respect For things that are of high effect. They've danced all modesty to the rear, And give to character a wicked jeer. All slang and low profanity Is the real life blood of humanity. They've danced away from modern care Into a world of pits and snares. And now the town isn't large enough So they've gone to the woods with the filthy stuff. They've danced till dance halls lost their charm And now they dance through the woods till dawn. A school teacher can ruin a helpless school girl And go right on teaching as though he's a pearl. Our so-called leaders will quiet it down, Notwithstanding they have children in town. They never stop to think for a while That that girl is some mother's child. They've danced our girls into gambling dens. Into low poolrooms with rankest of men. They've danced all places of recreation Into downright, outlaw bootleg stations. They've danced the bootlegger into success And got this town into a terrible mess. To make the country a nation of fools, They've opened up wicked dancing schools. They've danced until the dollar rules, There's no moral suasion in our schools. These all-night parties, all supreme, Have danced our girls into cigarette fiends. And so-called boasted ruby lips Are sallowed with tainted cigarette tips. I see that temperance is on the wane Since woman refuses to abstain. They've danced modesty so low down Till conversations are whispering sounds. School teachers, bootleggers, mothers and gamblers Are all mixed up in a human scramble. It's the life of the vicious, the life of the low, Intelligent people should count for no more. It was a relic in barbarous marts In heathen Indiaâamong Hottentots. Cicero styled them as maniac fools, Socrates and Plato as human cesspools. They danced proud Rome down to the lowest depths, And brought Greece down to a prostrate death. Dissipated the mind, corrupted the heart, Seared the conscience and wrecked all parts. They danced till hell with its wicked net Has made women slaves to cigarettes. And this, with the club rooms and bootleg drink, Has placed them in the human garbage sink. The midnight puffs and the midnight sips Have taken the ruby from woman's lips; It has also taken refinement offâ And as to modestyâgives it a scoff. All this mess is the underworld glow, It receives its start on the ballroom floor. And the ballroom gets its sure foundation From the homelife's wicked recreation. And now let's quietly count the cost And see what is one night's gain or loss: With toes stuck down and heels bent in And bodies shaped like a string in the wind, The next day as a firm aspect They hobble along like a human wreck. One month's salary for an evening dress, The next day ruined for want of rest. With nerves unstrung and heart molested, Feet cramped up makes blood congested. Morale depraved and mind deranged, Tell me, what has been the gain? What has it added to young womanhood? To human uplift, what is its good? Has it inspired anyone to aim high? To look up, lift up, all wrong defy? Suppose the Saviour on His second trip Should find you hugged in a ballroom grip; With you in your giddy, vicious affair Would you ask Him to have a seat And wait till your monkeyshines were complete? How can you shape the destinies of men And wallow with them in the rankest of sin? How can we lift our youngsters up When we let them dance with the lowest pups? âShe stoops to conquerâ will still hold its place Till the ballroom sinks into disgrace. Now according to these indications, Don't we need re-emancipation? MRS. C. E. STEPHENSâ (Retired school teacher after three score years of service.) It's a pleasure to pay this tribute To the grand and noble woman, Mrs. Charlotte E. Stephens, who Adopted as her omen The building of human character, And she fought for it like a Trojan. Now let's run up the balance sheet And see just how she stands; What has she done in the sixty years To meet the world's demands? What has she done in the building of men In accordance with God's command? What has been her real value In this world of intellect? What has she contributed to the world That's above her cash assets? In the final total footing up Has she paid her honest debts? She's brought woman her honor dear By healing long disgraces; She's proven to the wrangling world By filling many places, That the time has come when woman must March out and lead the races. She started in her noble work While John Brown's blood was warm, While Lincoln's assassination Was the topic of the throng, And the Ku Klux Klan was trying to prove That liberty was wrong. In the midst of all these conflicts She planted her little flag And moved right on in opposition Of the enemy's sneers and nags, Till she'd won them over and made them help To wave that self-same flag. Three score years of service Not knowing how to shirk, Three score years in a steady drive, And ever on the alert, Knowing that the night was coming When no human being could work. She has builded human monuments here, The walls of which will stand Long after she's departed from Her dwelling on the land, Long after buildings have crumbled That were built upon the sand. She decided to build for others Buildings that sheltered her not, Beneath the roof of the building She's to have no part or lot, And some who dwell in the building Through all time may know her not. And yet, when the days shall have ended, And beneath the roof tree's shade, When the children and the grandchildren In their childish way have played, And passed from under the building And vanished into the shade, Some dwellers beneath that roof tree, Thinking of when it was new, May say as their thoughts turn backward, Keeping their ages in view, The woman who builded these buildings Builded better than she knew. And she, after she's passed onward Hearing the Master's call, May say, though it may not matter To her what the buildings befall, That it's better to build for others Than to build no buildings at all. That song that has caused countless millions To turn toward the heavenly throne, That song that stirred her life blood And made her heart throbs known, âLord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching home.â Some day, when death steps on the scene Saying, âYou must go under the sod,â She can smilingly say, âThere is no death, I do not fear your clods, For during all my life's work I've been standing on the promise of God.â âDELINQUENCYâ This poem has been extracted from a piece of prose text. Home, the sanctuary of life, That stamps impressions for life, Who is the center of attraction there? It is the mother, the wife. RACIAL FACTS This poem has been extracted from a piece of prose text. The blood-chilling horrors of Hitler And his hellish degradation Is all we have in history To match this lynching civilization. EVERLASTING FACTS This poem has been extracted from a collection of aphorisms. If I could, as an artist, Draw a slaughter pen for children, I'd show to brutal Hitler How he dump'd them there by the million. FILIBUSTERINGâ This filibustering nonsense In the nation's senate hall Is simply one more step To the nation's final fall. All those unhappy phrases They should try to set aright Are dwelt upon with mighty force To make as dark as night. A just investigation To show the brighter side Is never made by those who strive Forever to deride. The Negro's moral standard Sir, has never been as low As those destructive lynchers' Hearts who never strive to know Whether it was a crime or not. They're simply satisfied To pass their own weak judgment, They crave the Negro's hide. There's no clan in America Whose moral pathway's filled With thorns as is the Negro's And he must tread at will. America's Christianity's Not recognized by Him Who came to earth to die for man And give him Christian trim. Her body's broken by disease, Her conscience seared with crime; A mind and soul of cruelty To cap the heathen climes. And in the light of all these things, It is a poor spirit To point with Christian horror But never try to prohibit. Ah! What a reckless nation, What an undisciplined child, Noble, but something tricky, Doing some things that are wild. O white man! have you any heart? And did you ever sigh? And did your senses ever start By the Negro's wailing cry? AMERICA'S DISGRACE This poem has been extracted from a piece of prose text. The southern white man's bugaboo, âNigger want to set in his parlor,â And in his political campaign, This has been his holler. Darn the white man's parlor, We have parlors of our own, Bigger, grander, better Than the white man has ever known. We don't want his social mix-up, We simply want room to stand. Break down all stumbling blocks, Give us the rights of man. White man hoist the window, White man open the door, White man give the right of way, The black man ask no more. THE DEVIL ABDICATEDâ I read somewhere in a worn-out book About a traveling rebel Who went about in every nook To bring men to his level. And everything he undertook Was filled with glee and revel. His road was filled with snares and crooks, I think his name was Devil. He was once cast out of heaven, Down into the darkest hole, But the nations longed for him, Called him back into their fold. He went into the Garden of Eden, Despoiled Paradise, you know; Then started on his mission With his Devil-face aglow. He has stalked across the nations, In every land and sea, And ever since creation, He has had his timely plea. Sometimes nations, sometimes empires Have been kneeling at his shrine, But his individual efforts Are as old and long as time. Finding America very prosperous He put whiskey in the land To wreck our homes, to shorten life, To kill the spiritual man. He auctioned off the brightest hopes Of the nation's young manhood. He dulled the conscience of the race So everything looked good. The women struggling forty years Brought temperance to its goal. Then Satan's agent, with one stroke, Knocked all their efforts cold. He made them discard discipline From our homes, our schools, our churches, And produced a generation With its morals all on crutches. Old Satan, he's just tickled How he sways the hearts of men, How he ruled the entire nation With his wicked, lustful sin. Having America under good control With the underworld on top, He left in search of other fields To cultivate his crop. He stepped across the ocean To see Herr Hitler's doings, He saw human degradation, Centuries of civilization ruined, He saw Finland mutilated And proud Poland massacred, The Czechs humiliated, Norway swallowedâgreed! He saw Belgium torn to pieces, The Netherlands terrorized, Poor helpless Spain was ravished, Women and children crucified. He saw the handwriting on the wall Which read to this effect: âThe little nations have no rights That Hitler must respect.â He saw gay French society Busy manicuring their toes While Hitler was preparing Proud France to overthrow. He saw all avenues of science Once worked for man's welfare, Have now been concentrated To bring on this despair. All the sights that he'd ever seen Since the dawn of first creation, Before his mind began to gleam And cause his soul's stagnation. The horrors of Siberia Against the thriving Jew, Mob violence in China Dissented from his view. The blood-chilling horrors of slavery, The damnable lynching bee All faded from his memory At Hitler's massacre. During all this civil tirade He slaughtered innocent children, He butchered helpless women, Yes, he mowed them down by millions. The savage of the lowest type In war, would butcher men, But never slaughtered children, He considered that a sin! The Indian looking for human scalp Would skin the men alive, Denied God, disputed the Bible, But never skinned a womanâ He had some savage pride. It remained for cruel dictators Of highly civilized nations To slaughter women and children, Thus degrading civilization. The thoughts of Rome on fire While Nero played the fiddle Were very insignificant To Hitler's wicked riddles. Hitlerâarchipelago of Europe, Dardanelles of civilization. A rogue of international fameâ Stealing land and mobbing nationsâ Runs rampant like a giant brute In little peaceful lands, Threatening the very way of lifeâ Monstrous perversion of man. He punished the ears for hearing, Shut mouths and padlocked minds, Blinded the eyes against the light, Burned books that right would chime, Degraded individual human right, Destroyed all search of truth, Then built concentration camps To assassinate our youths! He auctioned off the brightest hopes Of all humanity's wooings, Turned back humanitarian clocks From upward to downward doings. He blasphemed all the decencies Of civilization's ties, Lied, pillaged, dehumanized. The monstrous product of many wrongs And of soul-destroying hatred, Producer of unspeakable horrors That cannot be related. Scientists, artists, men of letters Beaten to death in the streetâ Driven from homesâfor what? Wouldn't worship at Hitler's feet. Men were dragged to death holes Known as detention campsâ Shot down by ruthless, brutal beasts For refusing Hitler's vamp. Then Satan said, âIf Sherman could Peep back at Hitler's spell, He'd cry aloud, âI've changed my mind, War's ten times worse than Hell.ââ Then Satan said, with tearful eyes, âThis civilized disgrace Induces me to abdicate, Let Hitler take my placeâ I'm going back to Hell for peace, Don't call me back to earth Till Hitler's brutal force has ceased And the world has been rebirthed.â Then Satan said, âI seem to hear Long distance radio Pronounce the glad news to the world That Hitler is no more. If that is true, I'll change my mind, What shall I do?âOh, well, It's a settled fact, if Hitler's gone, We both can't live in Hell! O MOTHERS!â Inspired by your daughter's beauty and youth, Surround her with all the fragments of truth, For we're drawn by those who us surround, Till little of our native self is found, And it's from the scenes 'mid which we're placed That deep affect's on our being traced. Her character'll be judged by her associates, With whom she mingles, she'll participate. Teach her that flesh and a suit of clothes Looks nice, but it's not the best that grows, For under that suit can be man or hog And it's best to consider his dialogue. And teach her that it's not in a dress parade That womanhood is at her best displayed. Teach her that it's not the ballroom sport Who is the defender of life's stronghold. They are nice and polite and give a good time, But to life's deeper meanings they are blind. They mix with those who are degrading, And scorn those who are elevating. Teach her to ponder early and late Over the human ballroom's fate. âTHE NEW AMERICAââ My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Would I could sing; Its land of pilgrim's pride Also where lynched men died With such upon her tide Freedom can't reign. My native country thee, They would pronounce you free, Thy name I love; But when the lynchers rise To slaughter human lives, Thou closeth up thine eyes, Thy God's above. Let Negroes smell the breeze So they can sing with ease Sweet freedom's song; Let justice reign supreme, Let me be what they seem, Break up that lynching screen, Lay down all wrong. Our Father's God to thee, Author of liberty, To Thee we sing. How can our land be bright, Can lynching be a light? Protect us by Thy might, Great God our King. BOULEâ The Boule is not a man-maker, But is composed of men ready made; Men, whose reputations Are true and tried and staid; Men with taste and character formed, Beyond the dangerous age. Men who can breast the fiercest storm On life's tempestuous stage. The Boule oath connects its men In strong fraternity, The civic and political trend With religious activities. The social tie predominates With discipline and education. Then its advisery and creative, With directive inspiration. The Boule makes no outside show To attract the world at large, But silent work within its doors Directs its human barge. The vicissitudes of a busy life, Part thought, part work, part play, Dispels all signs of human strife And stimulates a real Boule.</field>
