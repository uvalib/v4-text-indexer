      <field name="fulltext">Depend on Christ, thou canst not fail, Make all thy wants and wishes known; Fear not, His merits shall prevail, Ask what thou will, It shall be done. PREFACE. As the greatest minds display themselves, in the most turbulent storms on the call of necessity, so the Negro has to boast, among others, his Flora Batson— a bright star in the history of mankind. If I should select one feature in her character which is more prominently marked than any other, I should name that deep religious feeling with which she seemed for the most part to have been impressed. Taught from the very first by sad experience that this was no world of rest, she was left to lift up her soul to God,—seeking ease from Him who wounds and heals, who kills and makes alive. This love of God induced her to love her neighbor, and what but this could have sustained her amid labours that would have dampened the energy of almost every other woman; what but this gave her power of being—a star and example to her people; requiring nothing from them, but what she was willing to exhibit in her own character and conduct? I know not which of the many virtues to admire most—her talent, industry, charity, or perseverance, for all blend together in beautiful harmony in the life and character of Flora Batson, and the world will continue to gather many golden fruits sown by her, and let my race cry aloud with joyful pride: “The woman is near of kin unto us.” Above all, who will not abound in thanksgiving to Almighty God, who raised up this mighty instrument that has proved as of incalculable benefit to my people? He who watched the gradual growth of this slender plant and enabled it to expand into the beauteous tree, unscathed by the storm of winter or the heat of the summer's sun; with Him “all things are ours.” He is our only foundation of hope. This is truly the stone which was set at naught of you builders, which has become the head of the corner. And now see to it that ye fail not, and that you build upon it, and let the structure grow higher and higher, until its top has reached the pinnacle of perfection, and the angel Batson steps out upon its highest balcony and shouts his praise in glory. I have written this little book after many prayers to ascertain God's and my people's will. My object is simply to try and bring forth something of the harvest of virtue, gleaned from a life of usefulness, by one of God's creatures. Many have not the means of purchasing large and expensive works on any subject, hence I have tried hard to place the fruit within the reach of all who will but put forth their hand and pluck of the same. I am aware of the greatness of the grand little woman of whom I have dared to write, and her greatness diminishes my individuality; so it can be plainly observed that it is no great task for the writer to be entirely obscured by the subject chosen, and if I stagger and halt under the weight of my load, we will say, “'Twas too heavy.” GERARD MILLAR. GOD'S WAYS ARE BEST. On June 13th, 1906, I noticed Miss Batson had been weeping, and on going to my room that night I wrote the following little poem that she seems to love so, and after reading it to her she said, “Put it away, and use it when I am gone from you.” Little did I think as I sealed it up and put it aside with my precious papers, that I would ever live to look on it after she was no more on earth. But for some reason I am here to carry out her wish, and for the first time I am trying to give this poem to the world. Cheer up, little woman; The time will come bye and bye, When the sun of satisfaction Will shine out in your sky; When every lonely moment now Spent with head bowed low, Will be consumed with hours of joy, And you will weep no more. Your voice has cheered thousands Whose hearts were bowed with grief, And to their weary souls Brought comfort, joy, relief. Now put your trust in Jesus, And clouds now black as night Will soon be bright and blue, And gates of opposition will open wide for you. Why halt and look behind you To days past and gone? They have no power to bid you hope; Their prospects are forlorn. The sunshine of the coming day Has split the darkest night, And even as the shadows sway, Ambition bids us fight. There is a goal that you must reach, A steep and rugged bluff, Until your name is written, There, Forget to Cry Enough. The thorns that pierce your feet and hands Should only give you warning, That the darkest hour that e'er appears Is the courier of the morning. I know the path is winding; Its crooks are sharp, severe; The Labor slow and grinding, And filters many a tear; The load at times seems heavy; It bends us to our knees. But there we find the remedy, Prayer's ever soothing breeze. So buckle on faith's armour, That shines as bright as day; And don't forget the Passwords: Watch, and fight, and Pray. And when the smoke of battle Has blown from East to West, Your tired, weary, troubled soul Will say, God's way is best. CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL. Another original composition that gave her much joy. Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever God's there be For this unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced or cried aloud; Under the bludgerings of chance My head is bruised but still unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds me calm, but un-afraid. It matters not how fierce the gait, How charged with punishments the goal; I am the Master of My Fate; I am the Captain of My Soul. VENGEANCE IS MINE SAYETH GOD. Sitting beneath a tree in the Southland a few years ago, I noticed one very large grave. Upon making inquiry, I was told it contained the “Colored Victims” of that kind of murder known as “Lynching” indulged in by certain classes of “law abiding citizens.” This game of slaughter is purely an American institution, and is not confined to any particular section of the land of the free and the home of the brave. My excuse for this so-called poem is, what it lacks poetically is over-balanced by truth. An old oak tree that stood in a lane, Tossed by the winds and beat by the rain, On a lonely night as its long limbs bend, Whispered this tale to a listening friend: Many years ago upon this land An “acorn” dropped from a farmer's hand. How it took root none can tell But God, who rules Heaven and earth so well. First came a twig, a sappling, a tree, And I am the last-named of the three. I've sheltered the deer when all was still, And felt the sting of the woodpecker's bill. My summers have been hot and oft' too brief; Each winter has robbed me of every leaf, And many a snow has covered this lane. But that's God's works, and I don't complain. And the story I tell, please understand, Makes me proud I'm a tree and not a man. On a silent night, when my feathered crew Calmly slept in the midnight dew. Came tramp of feet and yell of crowd, And dust in the road raised its shroud. No beast of the field or fowls of the air Ever made such sounds, I do declare. Every twig and bough and leaf stood still, As the howling mob came over yon hill, And in their midst, all bleeding and tore, Drags one of God's creatures for whom the cross He bore. And here at my foot they stopped with him, And threw a rope o'er this withered limb, And as the cloud took the moonlight away, A man uttered these words: “Nigger, you pray!” The prisoner bound looked straight in his face, Then cast his eyes heavenward; no fear I could trace; Then dropped to his knees, it hardly seems true, Said: “Lord, forgive them; they know not what they do.” Then high in the air swung the form of this man, And the murderers had broken God's holy command; But, not satisfied at the crime they had done, They stepped back a pace; each drew his gun. And there in the moonlight, where grim shadows fell, Took aim, and emptied shell after shell. The body seemed to struggle, writhe and sway, And a soul to its Maker, a form to clay. And once more the crowd crept back o'er the hill, The noise had ceased and all was still. And down on my trunk, without any sound, I could feel the life's blood running slow to the ground. And as death's pallor settled o'er his face It left me a picture time ne'er can erase. I saw not far distant a woman and child Creep slowly up to yon moss-covered stile, And, looking around, she trembled in fright, And a scream left her lips as she gazed on the sight. She tottered as if she'd fall to the ground, And then on her face seemed to settle a frown, And with arms pressed tightly round the fatherless youth, Said: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” And kneeling, she prayed and moaned in grief, Till this of itself seemed to bring relief. And the wind from the north caused the body to swing, Then back to her passion her thoughts made a spring, And said to her son: “Touch the back of this tree. Say, word for word, this oath after me.” Then in the still night she sent up a vow, Tree as I am I'll not repeat now. But one thing, old friend, let me say to you, The tortures of hell to her edict are few. She mentioned the slave ship, the master, the man. As the blood of her husband stained her quivering hand, And then in one voice she and the child did declare The red arm of vengeance is lifted and bare. She cried out for justice to answer her back— Was it right she must suffer because God made her black? And then all was quiet, the night's work was done, And there in one grave sleeps father, mother, son. The funeral was simple, no sign of discord; Five words was the sermon, “Vengeance is Mine, sayeth God.” SERMON INSPIRED POEM. The following poem was written in the little historical town of Knadenhutton, O., March 21, 1906: Editor of The Chronicle: At the concert given by Gerard Millar and Miss Flora Batson, Sunday evening, in the Moravian Church, Mr. Millar rendered the following poem of his own production. Mr. Millar attended services in the morning, and the poem is the result of the impressions he received. Yours truly, R. L. Frazier. We attended church this morning In a little country town; The edifice was beautiful, Trimmed in green and brown. We sat up near the chancel The sermon to enjoy, Because if you sit back in church There's something to annoy. The pastor took his text From the Sermon on the Mountain, He handled it masterly, He took us to the fountain. Ad as we sat and listened In that high and holy place For a while we were forgetful Of the color of our face. He pictured man and woman As God said we should be, Without the shackles of the slave Or the haughtiness of the free. He spoke of Jesus dying, Of his sleeping in the grave, The nail that pierced his hands and feet This sinful world to save. On earth we find some people Who pretend they understand That Jesus hung and bled and died For a certain race of man. They scorn the yellow Japanese, Speak harshly of his birth, But in His holy book we find We all are dust of earth. In the breast of the Ethiopian Is a heart, a mind, a soul, That to our blessed Savior Is more precious than the gold. Now, if we let our thoughts speed With style and earthly pelf, Can we obey God's word which says, “Love thy neighbor as thyself?” So let us all take warning By this woman's plaintive plea And cry aloud from the darkness, “My Redeemer, pity me!” In listening to this noble man Of eloquence and thought We could but think how dearly Our redemption had been bought. The picture drawn for me by him As plain as day and night, He told us to inherit We must dare to do the right. His reference to parental love Of king or queen or slave Took our thoughts on a journey From the cradle to the grave. We saw the Queen of England With her son, the Prince of Wales, As she fondled and caressed him And told him fairy tales. We saw the poor black mother, Whose heart knew naught of rest, And heard the scream that left her lips For the babe torn from her breast. And the same imagination Brought the slave ship to my eyes As the fettered bondsmen cried aloud, Oh Lord, be Thou my guide. We saw those brave Moravians— Who stood in yonder grove— And as assassins struck them down They praised the God of Love. And to-night from the snowy mantle That covers up the spot Blooms forth the flower of martyrdom, The sween forget-me-not. —Uhrichsville Chronicle, March 22, 1906. THE BLACK MAN'S PLEA. The next is “The Black Man's Plea.” This Miss Batson was committing to memory to read in our production of “The Clansman's Confession,” produced the first time in the new Twelfth Baptist Church, Boston, Mass, Rev. M. H. N. Shaw, D. D., M. D., pastor; the second time at Batson's last concert at Big Bethel A. M. E. Church, Philadelphia, Pa., Rev. R. Wm. Fickland, D. D., pastor. Mme. Ella Wright Pleasants, of Frankford, Pa., recited this poem, “The Black Man's Plea,” on that evening. Behold I'm knocking at your door, My hands are bruised and bleeding. If you will not bid me enter, Pray listen to my pleading. I have some startling things to say: To you I am no stranger; My hope like yours for heaven's bliss Was fixed in Bethlehem's manger. The lips that speak these words are black; 'Twas God that willed it so. If I am true to every trust, Why should you treat me so? Behind your walls of prejudice All scattered on the ground Is that which made your people great. Why can I not stoop down? And pick from out the volumes Of long forgotten lore That which will make my people, too, In higher regions sore. I do not crave equality, Social or otherwise; I simply pray you let me look With these God given eyes. And pluck the fruit of intellect From limbs within my reach, That I may aid your people To practice what they preach. Don't tell me of my ignorance, For this I know too well. But “stop me” when you see me On the road that leads to hell. It was not I who sought thee, When in my native domains. Ah, but 'twas you who brought me, Bound in cruel chains. Note the slave ship and its crew Plow the briny flood. What should be a spotless deck Is bathed in human blood. Hear the many mournful sounds From out the filthy reeking hole. Though the savage is chained down, God gave to him a soul. In my vision I can see Three crosses in a line. On the center one is “He,” Who for the world is dying. See your clansman's multitude, Robed in white and red; Justice with her tired eyes Weeping o'er our dead. Thousands murdered, oh how cruel! Without judge or jury; Shot down, slaughtered, burned to crisp, In the mad rush of fury. How you've sought to justify The deeds of this, your Klan; 'Tis no use, your soul will cry, “You've killed your fellow man.” All the silver, all the land, Every lump of gold, Will not compensate a man For giving up his soul. Let your brother, robed in black, Bless or curse you as he will; For you there's no looking back; There's no peace; be still. But to him, Ah, let me say, Take courage, look to God. There is still a brighter day For all who keep his word. And with this I leave you now 'Twixt God, and man, and thee. Take an oath, a solemn vow, To hear the black man's Plea. “SHOUT HIS PRAISE, GLORY.” As sung by Miss Flora Batson. Six weeks' revival work at Wylie Avenue A. M. E. church, Pittsburg, Pa., Rev. J. W. Townsend, D. D., pastor. During the great revival of 1906 Miss Batson gave her services to this great cause, and I am requested to insert the songs she sang. I am sorry I have not space for but one, which I hope may satisfy my readers: You ask what makes me happy, my heart so free from care. It is because my Saviour, in mercy heard my prayer; He me brought out of darkness, and now the light I see; O blessed loving Saviour! to him the praise shall be. Chorus. I will shout his praise in glory, (So will I, so will I,) And we'll all sing halleujah in heaven by and by; I will shout his praise in glory, (So will I, so will I,) And we'll all sing hallelujah in heaven by and by. I was a friendless wand'rer till Jesus took me in. My life was full sorrow, my heart was full of sin; But when the blood so precious, spoke pardon to my soul; Oh, blissful, blissful moment! 'twas joy beyond control. —Cho. I wish that every sinner before his throne would bow; He waits to bid them welcome, he longs to bless them now; If they but knew the rapture that in his love I see, They'd come and shout salvation, and sing his praise with me. —Cho. I mean to live for Jesus, while here on earth I stay, And when his voice shall call me to realms of endless day. As one by one we gather, rejoicing on the shore, We'll shout his praise in glory, and sing forevermore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few poems she used to love so much, every one of which is an original composition. —By the Author. DON'T WORRY. Don't worry—though above your head The threatening storm clouds meet; The rainbow as of yore shall spread Its signs of promise sweet. The flowers fled, the winter gray Proclaimed again his cruel sway. Yet every blossom's smile will say, Don't worry. Don't worry, though the noon-tide find Your footsteps faltering; The morn's glad hopes left far behind, The day its joys shall bring. When sunset's radiant curtain falls, Sleeps angel ready at the call Of night, shall whisper low to all, Don't worry. Don't worry—though with little good Your eager quest seems fraught; She that has striven as she could Has striven as she ought. Ask not how destiny was planned; The little that we understand Is eloquent with the command, Don't worry. —Gerard Millar, The Basso. “ALONE.” One little word is the theme Of this poetic song, A reality, not a dream, Or vision of right or wrong. It has no chosen elect From which to gather toll; It reasons not with factions, Silver, gems or gold. It settles like a moonless night On everything that's near; It knows no stations in its flight, Has not a thought of fear. It wrings from each and every eye That silent pearly drop; Its passage like the wheels of time No power on earth can stop. It makes the mighty tremble As they march with heavy tread; Its features don't resemble The living or the dead. It sings the song of gladness; Can weep, can wail and moan; This is the word of sadness, Alone, Alone Alone! HAVE MERCY. Have mercy is the word we use When trouble gathers thick; Have mercy is the cry from us When stung by pain, and sick. Have mercy comes from mansion, From cabin and from cell; Have mercy from the beggar, The millionaire, as well. Have mercy comes from every lip, Though we cannot understand; Have mercy is the nation's cry, And spoke by every man. Have mercy in the time of peace, As well as time of strife; Have mercy when your fallen foe Shall beg you for his life. Have mercy on my people, Whose advantages are few; Have mercy, and the God of Love Has mercy then on you. ROOM AT THE TOP. Why struggle hard to reach the goal, When opposition crush the soul; Why make a fight for higher art, When nothing bids me to take heart. 'Mid tears and sorrow I've reached the top, But there stands the sentinel saying stop; Is it because I have fainted as I ran, Or because of the color of face or hand? My life has not yet reached disgrace; My toil in profession has gained a place. My feet have grown weary, tired I quake, But ne'er can I halt—too much at stake. I think of a mother's face and prayer, And her admonition, do and dare; And then I take courage and defy, And with greater ambition say I'll try. Then hopes bright sunshine shows the road, And God's own hand lightens the load; And as grim despair takes its flight, I stand out again equipped to fight. I approach the door with knock and sign; Wide fly the portals entrance to mine. With steady step and without fear, I read the verdict, “No favorites here.” Out in the arena I take my stand, No robes of purple, but empty hand; And step by step I fight my way, Till no opponents bid me stay. Rung after rung in the ladder of fame, With bleeding hands I climb for a name; And at last when 'tis over I must stop, I send back the message, Still room at the top. “IT IS I.” Who is it that has battled Against all kinds of odds? Who is it that has stopped To-day and cried aloud to God? “It is I.” Who is it that has stumbled So often on the way; And often falling on his knees, Lift up his voice to pray? “It is I.” Who is it that in years gone by Knew all the joys of home; But, ah to-night they sit and sigh, Deserted and alone? “It is I.” Who is it that has knelt beside The bed of dying friend, And watched the monster Death Dog their footsteps to the end? “It is I.” Who is it that has struggled up, Though my limbs would sting and ache; And brushed the briny tear away, New courage then to take? “It is I.” Who is it that can hardly see What step they next must take; When every new day brings to me A blow my heart to break? “It is I.” Who is it that must not complain? 'Tis weak, 'tis wrong in man. My loss to others, has been gain, Must learn to understand. “It is I.” Who is it that in good reports Will clap their hands in glee; But when the light of hope burns low Don't trust God's eyes to see? “It is I.” Who is it that will here admit, My faith 'tis very weak; Ad when for Him I should explain, I dare not even speak? “It is I.” —Gerard Millar. TEARS. It's past midnight, Not a sound greets my ear, Alone I sit thinking In sorrow, not fear. My heart seems to've stopped, I care not to speak When I'm aroused by the scald Of a “tear” on my cheek. For a moment it pauses, Then drops into space, And one more grief emblem Has left this poor face. I turn my gaze earthward, And there on the ground The dew drop of sorrow Its haven has found. But what of the fountain From which it has flown. Has it left a “twin brother” Or did it dwell there alone? For answer, ah! friend, Ask the husband or wife Who has witnessed the battle Of death versus life. And the orphan, too, In grief can groan In a way that will prove No tear is alone. THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN. In a mansion in the Southland Sat a handsome boy and girl, And with fingers white and shapely Toyed with a golden curl. He said, Sister, will you answer, If I should ask you why Man with so much power here below Is at last compelled to die? She gently shrugged her shoulders, And said, Why, brother Paul, Death is bad, we must admit; But that don't end it all. But, said he, we both are young; Our sins on earth are few. Little harm I've ever done, Much less been done by you. Yes, very true, my brother dear, Of this I'm proud, yea glad. But Justice collects duty From good as well as bad, We represent a race, she said, Whose power shows no bound, And with the heel of prejudice Grind others in the ground. Our Father was a planter In a far off Southern State, He owned slaves by the hundred; That part of it I hate. For every inch of land and blade of gras Around my native home Brings to my mind the lash of whip And tired bondman's groan. And just now as we are speaking On this particular line, I will describe a vision That comes before my mind. In a little old log cabin, Many, many miles away, Sits a crippled Negro woman, Her hair is, oh, so grey. Her face, though somewhat wrinkled, Shows suffering and pain. Has still the trace of beauty That years ago did reign. She fumbles in her bosom, Finds the photo of a boy— And as the tears flow freely, She says, my pride, my joy. And her eyes are raised heavenward, As she lisps a silent prayer; Points to the mound with trembling hand; She says, He's sleeping there. And then the force of pent-up grief Caused her aged form to shake; And I remember 'twas my race Burned her poor boy at the stake. Was he vile, uneducated, Or a savage in disguise; Or just another victim Of prejudice and lies? This boy played with my father; To well we knew his worth, And my grandpa's duplicity Was responsible for his birth. In the little school-house on the hill, That stood beneath those trees, Is where taught his people To say their A B C's. And for this crime alone, my dear, They took his life away. But don't you know for all these things There comes a reckoning day. The leopard spots, we have them too; We try hard to erase. There's but one ending to such crimes: Destruction, Death, Disgrace. Take the flood at Galveston, And its stacks of purging frames; They threw them far out in the sea; Floods washed them back again. And wild waves mocked them, And in their thundering tone Said, you delight in burning human flesh; Here's chance to burn your own. Next comes San Francisco, Who flirted long with fate. Its glorious fruits and flowers; Its boasted Golden Gate. Where the God who sent them Life, Liberty and Light, Was treated with contempt and scorn, By day as well as night. Whiskey Dens, Dance Halls, Theatres, Parks, as well, Stood as mighty mile posts Pointing men to Hell. And on Sabbath, as on week day, Never checked their sinful mirth; Saying, Are we not all powerful, And don't we rule the earth? But on that awful morning, Just about the peep of day, When birds were singing sweetly, 'Mid the fruit and new mown hay; The Earth it seems to tremble; To boil, to turn around; And the highest, strongest buildings Staggered and toppled to the ground, And frantic men and women Rushed forth in scant attire Through clouds of dust so angry, Armed with fangs of fire. A man rushed madly through the street, His infant in his arms; And labored hard to shield The dear one from all harm; When a piece of falling timber, That coming down like rain, Like an arrow from the bow of fate, Pierced the infant's brain. On right and left, front and rear, Come cries of deep despair. No pen or tongue can e'er describe The misery pictured there. In twenty-eight short seconds, Less than a half minute's time, Life, property and wealth Had paid the debt divine. What means this devastation Of this our land so fair? Can we say with guiltless cnscience That our greed for earthly gain Has caused us for a moment To give to others pain. Have we rendered unto Cæsar That which to him belongs? If not, our heavenly Father knows, And he will not sanction wrong. Have we dared to scorn the creatures Made by God's own hand— Because they once wore fetters? Have we looked down upon them When perhaps they are our betters. Does the dizzy heights to which we've sprung Make us forget the call That God in His wise judgment Doth mark the sparrows fall? If it does, like old Beltshazzer, There's handwriting on the wall. I hear the cry of fettered slaves, The screams of fevered lips; And hear the many groans and prayers As they pile on sinful chips. I see the weeping widow and orphan child, as well. And hear the snarl of Satan As he points his brood to hell. And the weary sin sick soul Staggers on his way to Jordan, Bearing a load of sin and shame— 'Tis the White Man's Burden. LIFE'S FINALE. After the day has ended; After the toil has ceased; After the vale of the evening, The blackness of night increased. After the lamps are lighted; After the curtain's pulled down; After the song of the robin, 'Tis heard from the tree, not the ground. After the romping of childhood, After the love tales told, After the wooing and wedding, Then comes your chance to be old. After the cares of the family; After sunset in your sky; After the meeting comes parting: Good Bye, Loved One, Good Bye.</field>
