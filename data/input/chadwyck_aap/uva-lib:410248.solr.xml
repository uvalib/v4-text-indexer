      <field name="fulltext">LIFE OF GEORGE M. HORTON, The Colored Bard of North-Carolina. The following four poems have been extracted from this auto-biographical account. [Rise up, my soul, and let us go] Rise up, my soul, and let us go Up to the gospel feast; Gird on the garment white as snow, To join and be a guest. Dost thou not hear the trumpet call For thee, my soul, for thee? Not only thee, my soul, but all, May rise and enter free. Excited from reading the obedience of Nature to her Lord in the vessel on the sea. Master, we perish if thou sleep, We know not whence to fly; The thunder seems to rock the deep, Death frowns from all the sky. He rose, he ran, and looking out, He said, ye seas, be still; What art thou, cruel storm, about? All silenced at his will. Dost thou not know that thou art mine, And all thy liquid stores; Who ordered first the sun to shine And gild thy swelling shores. My smile is but the death of harm, Whilst riding on the wind, My power restrains the thunder's arm, Which dies in chains confined. [Sing, O ye ransom'd, shout and tell] Sing, O ye ransom'd, shout and tell What God has done for ye; The horses and their riders fell And perish'd in the sea. Look back, the vain Egyptian dies Whilst plunging from the shore; He groans, he sinks, but not to rise, King Pharaoh is no more. EULOGY. [Deep on thy pillar, thou immortal dame] To the much distinguished Mrs. Hentz of Boston, I owe much for the correction of many poetical errors. Being a professional poetess herself, and a lover of genius, she discovered my little uncultivated talent, and was moved by pity to uncover to me the beauties of correctness, together with the true importance of the object to which I aspired. She was extremely pleased with the dirge which I wrote on the death of her much lamented primogenial infant, and for which she gave me much credit and a handsome reward. Not being able to write myself, I dictated while she wrote; and while thus engaged she strove in vain to avert the inevitable tear slow trickling down her ringlet-shaded cheek. She was indeed unequivocally anxious to announce the birth of my recent and astonishing fame, and sent its blast on the gale of passage back to the frozen plains of Massachusetts. This celebrated lady, however, did not continue long at Chapel Hill, and I had to regret the loss of her aid, which I shall never forget in life. At her departure from Chapel Hill, she left behind her the laurel of Thalia blooming on my mind, and went with all the spotless gaiety of Euphrosyne with regard to the signal services which she had done me. In gratitude for all these favors, by which she attempted to supply and augment the stock of servile genius, I inscribe to her the following Deep on thy pillar, thou immortal dame, Trace the inscription of eternal fame; For bards unborn must yet thy works adore, And bid thee live when others are no more. When other names are lost among the dead, Some genius yet may live thy fame to spread; Memory's fair bush shall not decline to bloom, But flourish fresh upon thy sacred tomb. When nature's crown refuses to be gay, And ceaseless streams have worn their rocks away; When age's vail shall beauty's visage mask, And bid oblivion blot the poet's task, Time's final shock shall elevate thy name, And lift thee smiling to eternal fame. INTRODUCTION. The author of the following miscellaneous effusions, asserts that they are original, and recently written; and they are now presented to the test of criticism, whatever may be the result. It is entirely different from his other work entitled the Museum, and has been written some time since that, and is not so large. The author is far from flattering himself with an idea of superiority, or even equality with ancient or other modern poets. He is deeply conscious of his own inferiority from the narrowness of the scope in which he has lived during the course of his past life. Few men of either a white or colored population, have been less prompted by a desire for public fame than he whose productions are now before you. He was actuated merely by pleasure and curiosity, as a call to some literary task, or as an example to remove the doubts of cavilists with regard to African genius. His birth was low, and in a neighborhood by no means populous; his raising was rude and laborious; his exertions were cramped, and his progress obstructed from start to goal; having been ever deprived of the free use of books and other advantages to which he aspired. Hence his genius is but an unpolished diamond, and can never shine forth to the world. Forbid to make the least attempt to soar, The stifled blaze of genius burns the more; He still prevails his drooping head to raise, Plods through the bogs, and on the mountains gaze. A BILLET DOUX. Dear Miss: Notwithstanding the cloud of doubts which overshadows the mind of adoring fancy, when I trace that vermillion cheek, that sapphire eye of expressive softness, and that symmetrical form of grace, I am constrained to sink into a flood of admiration beneath those heavenly charms. Though, dear Miss, it may be useless to introduce a multiplicity of blandishments, which might either lead you into a field of confusion, or absorb the truth of affection in the gloom of doubts; but the bell of adulation may be told from the distance of its echo, and cannot be heard farther than seen. Dear Miss, whatever may be the final result of my adventurous progress, I now feel a propensity to embark on the ocean of chance, and expand the sail of resolution in quest of the distant shore of connubial happiness with one so truly lovely. Though, my dearest, the thunders of parental aversion may inflect the guardian index of affection from its favorite star, the deviated needle recovers its course, and still points onwards to its native poll. Though the waves of calumny may reverberate the preserving mind of the sailing lover, the morning star of hope directs him through the gloom of trial to the object of his choice. My brightest hopes are mix'd with tears, Like hues of light and gloom; As when mid sun-shine rain appears, Love rises with a thousand fears, To pine and still to bloom. When I have told my last fond tale In lines of song to thee, And for departure spread my sail, Say, lovely princess, wilt thou fail To drop a tear for me? O, princess, should my votive strain Salute thy ear no more, Like one deserted on the main, I still shall gaze, alas! but vain, On wedlock's flow'ry shore. TROUBLED WITH THE ITCH, AND RUBBING WITH SULPHUR. 'Tis bitter, yet 'tis sweet, Scratching effects but transient ease; Pleasure and pain together meet, And vanish as they please. My nails, the only balm, To ev'ry bump are oft applied, And thus the rage will sweetly calm Which aggravates my hide. It soon returns again; A frown succeeds to ev'ry smile; Grinning I scratch and curse the pain, But grieve to be so vile. In fine, I know not which Can play the most deceitful game, The devil, sulphur, or the itch; The three are but the same. The devil sows the itch, And sulphur has a loathsome smell, And with my clothes as black as pitch, I stink where'er I dwell. Excoriated deep, By friction play'd on ev'ry part, It oft deprives me of my sleep, And plagues me to my heart. REGRET FOR THE DEPARTURE OF FRIENDS. As smoke from a volcano soars in the air, The soul of man discontent mounts from a sigh, Exhaled as to heaven in mystical prayer, Invoking that love which forbids him to die. Sweet hope, lovely passion, my grief ever chase, And scatter the gloom which veils pleasure's bright ray, O lend me thy wings, and assist me to trace The flight of my fair one when gone far away. When the dim star of pleasure sets glimmering alone, The planet of beauty on life's dreary shore, And th' fair bird of fancy forever is flown, On pinions of haste to be heard of no more. Hope, tell me, dear passion, thou wilt not forget, To flourish still sweetly and blossom as gay, Expelling like morning the gloom of regret, When the lark of affection is gone far away. If hurried into some unchangeable clime, Where oceans of pleasure continually roll, Far, far from the limited borders of time, With a total division of body and soul. Hope, tell me, dear passion, which must earth survive, That love will be sweeter when nature is o'er, And still without pain though eternity live, In the triumph of pleasure when time is no more. O love, when the day-light of pleasure shall close, Let the vesper of death break on life's dusky even; Let the faint sun of time set in peace as it rose, And eternity open thy morning in heaven. Then hope, lovely passion, thy torch shall expire, Effusing on nature life's last feeble ray; While the night maid of love sets her taper on fire, To guard smiling beauty from time far away. ON THE PLEASURES OF COLLEGE LIFE. With tears I leave these academic bowers, And cease to cull the scientific flowers; With tears I hail the fair succeeding train, And take my exit with a breast of pain. The Fresh may trace these wonders as they smile; The stream of science like the river Nile, Reflecting mental beauties as it flows, Which all the charms of College life disclose; This sacred current as it runs refines, Whilst Byron sings and Shakspeare's mirror shines. First like a garden flower did I rise, When on the college bloom I cast my eyes; I strove to emulate each smiling gem, Resolved to wear the classic diadem; But when the Freshman's garden breeze was gone, Around me spread a vast extensive lawn; 'Twas there the muse of college life begun, Beneath the rays of erudition's sun, Where study drew the mystic focus down, And lit the lamp of nature with renown; There first I heard the epic thunders roll, And Homer's light'ning darted through my soul. Hard was the task to trace each devious line, Though Locke and Newton bade me soar and shine; I sunk beneath the heat of Franklin's blaze. And struck the notes of philosophic praise; With timid thought I strove the test to stand, Reclining on a cultivated land, Which often spread beneath a college bower, And thus invoked the intellectual shower; E'en that fond sire on whose depilous crown, The smile of courts and states shall shed renown; Now far above the noise of country strife, I frown upon the gloom of rustic life, Where no pure stream of bright distinction flows, No mark between the thistle and the rose; One's like a bird encaged and bare of food, Borne by the fowler from his native wood, Where sprightly oft he sprung from spray to spray, And cheer'd the forest with his artless lay, Or fluttered o'er the purling brook at will, Sung in the dale or soar'd above the hill. Such are the liberal charms of college life, Where pleasure flows without a breeze of strife; And such would be my pain if cast away, Without the blooms of study to display. Beware, ye college birds, again beware, And shun the fowler with his subtile snare; Nor fall as one from Eden, stript of all The life and beauty of your native hall; Nor from the garden of your honor go, Whence all the streams of fame and wisdom flow; Where brooding Milton's theme purls sweet along With Pope upon the gales of epic song; Where you may trace a bland Demosthenes, Whose oratoric pen ne'er fails to please; And Plato, with immortal Cicero, And with the eloquence of Horace glow; There cull the dainties of a great Ainsworth, Who sets the feast of ancient language forth; Or glide with Ovid on his simple stream, And catch the heat from Virgil's rural beam; Through Addison you trace creation's fire, And all the rapid wheels of time admire; Or pry with Paley's theologic rays, And hail the hand of wisdom as you gaze; Up Murray's pleasant hill you strive to climb, To gain a golden summit all sublime, And plod through conic sections all severe, Which to procure is pleasure true and dear. The students' pensive mind is often stung, Whilst blundering through the Greek and Latin tongue; Parsing in grammars which may suit the whole, And will the dialect of each control. Now let us take a retrospective view, And whilst we pause, observe a branch or two. Geography and Botany unfold Their famous charms like precious seeds of gold; Zoology doth all her groups descry, And with Astronomy we soar on high; But pen and ink and paper all would fail, To write one third of this capacious tale. Geography presents her flowery train, Describes the mountain and surveys the plain, Measures the sounding rivers as they grow, Unto the trackless deeps to which they flow: She measures well her agriculture's stores, Which meet her commerce on the golden shore, Includes the different seasons of the year, And changes which pervade the atmosphere; Treats of the dread phenomena which rise In different shapes on earth, or issue from the skies; She points in truth to Lapland's frozen clime, And nicely measures all the steps of time; Unfolds the vast equator's burning line, Where all the stores of heat dissolve and shine; Describes the earth as unperceived she rolls, Her well-poised axis placed upon the poles. Botany, whose charms her florists well display, Whose lavish odours swell the pomp of May, Whose curling wreaths the steady box adorn, And fill with fragrance all the breeze of morn. Through various means her plants are oft applied, Improved by art, and well by nature tried; Thro' her, the stores of herbage are unroll'd, All which compose the vegetable world; Even the sensitives, which feel and shrink, From slightest touches, though they cannot think, Nor yet rejoice, void of the power to fear, Or sense to smell, to see, to taste, or hear. Zoology, with her delightful strain, Doth well the different animals explain; From multipedes to emmets in the dust, And all the groveling reptiles of disgust; She well descries the filthy beetle blind, With insects high and low of every kind; She with her microscope surveys the mite, Which ne'er could be beheld by naked sight; Thence she descends into the boundless deep, Where dolphins play and monsters slowly creep; Explores the foaming main from shore to shore, And hears with awe the dshing sea bull roar; Traces enormous whales exploding high Their floods of briny water to the sky; Describes the quadrupeds of ever shape, The bear, the camel, elephant and ape, And artful monkey, which but lack to talk, And like the human kind uprightly walk. Astronomy, with her ærial powers, Lifts us above this dreary globe of ours; Throughout the realms of ether's vast expanse, Her burning wings our towering minds advance; Measures her tropic well from line to line, And marks her rolling planets as they shine; Describes the magnitude of every star, And thence pursues her comets as they roll afar. But nature never yet was half explored, Though by philosopher and bard adored; Astronomer and naturalist expire, And languish that they could ascend no higher; Expositors of words in every tongue, Writers of prose and scribblers of song, Would fail with all their mathematic powers, And vainly study out their fleeting hours. Sir Walter Raleigh, Pen and Roberson, With Morse and Snowden, who are dead and gone, They all were, though mused their lives away, And left ten thousand wonders to display. And though the fiery chemists probe the mine The subterraneous bodies to define; Though melting flames the force of matter try, Rocks mix'd with brass and gold to pieces fly; And those who follow the electric muse, Amidst the wilds of vast creation loose Themselves like pebbles in the swelling main, And strive for naught these wanders to explain; Galvin himself, the monarch of the whole, Would blush his empty parchments to unroll. These different branches to one ocean go, Where all the streams of life together flow, Where perfect wisdom swells the tide of joy, A tide which must eternity employ; A boundless sea of love without a shore, Whose pleasure ebbs and flows forever more; Volume Divine! O thou the sacred dew, Thy fadeless fields see elders passing through, Thy constant basis must support the whole, The cabinet and alcove of the soul; It matters not through what we may have pass'd, To thee for sure support we fly at last; Encyclopedias we may wander o'er, And study every scientific lore, Ancient and modern authors we may read, The soul must starve or on thy pastures feed. These bibliothic charms would surely fall, And life grow dim within this college wall, The wheels of study in the mind would tire, If not supported by thy constant fire; Greatest of all the precepts ever taught Maps and vocabularies dearly bought, Burns with his harp, Scott, Cambell, and their flowers, Will shrink without the everlasting showers; Theology, thou sweetest science yet, Beneath whose boughs the silent classics sit, And thus imbibe the sacred rays divine, Which make the mitred faculty to shine; O for a gleam of Buck, immortal muse, With elder Scott and Henry to peruse; These lines which did a secret bliss inspire, And set the heads, the hearts, the tongues, on fire. Such is the useful graduate indeed, Not merely at the bar in law to plead, Nor a physician best to heal the flesh, But all the mystic power of soul and flesh; On such a senior let archangels smile, And all the students imitate his style, Who bears with joy the mission all divine, The beams of sanctitude, a Paul benign; Whose sacred call is to evangelise, A gospel prince, a legate of the skies, Whose bright diploma is a deed from heaven, The palm of love, the wreath of sins forgiven.</field>
