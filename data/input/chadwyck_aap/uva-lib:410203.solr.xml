      <field name="fulltext">The true Ministers are Instruments indeed in order to spread the Cement of Brotherly Love which unites us in one Sacred Band: and so let us all agree and work in peace. Ps. 133—And so remember me: this denotes the Angel in the bush and the Star in the East. Exod. 3rd. Ch. 2nd. Ver., Mat. 1st. Ch. 7th &amp; 10th. Ver., Rev. 1st. Ch. 16th &amp; 20th. Verse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE READER. This little book is for the more wise to give counsel, wherein I fail, and the more ignorant stumble, for want of knowledge, for we must first learn what is right and then pursue it; I have no doubt that when this comes before the face of the public there may be many misrepresentations on this subject, but my soul is at stake for I stand as a minister of God, 2 Tim. 4 c. 1, 2 v. and some may reject this on the account of my being a descendant of Ethiopia, and if so, then you may anticipate the feeling of your unworthy author; and he is well aware of the particular prejudice that still seems to exist from some whites towards that nation of people which is called Ethiopians, but my earnest prayer to God is that the time may soon come when that overruling prejudice of sin will die among all nations, and that the pure love of God may spring up in every heart and shine as the morning star, and that the Gospel may bear on the prejudice of man, and I feel it necessary to place my dependence upon the great Rock of Ages, in whose name and with whose words I come to you this day. I, choose to dedicate this little treaties to you, because sometimes those providences which appear rather out of the common line, are hard nuts in the mouth of a weak believer; but some of you have known me from the beginning and have been eye witnesses of most of the facts which I am going to relate, and if you will allow me to make an honest confession. My conscience has often lashed me for not keeping a diary, or rather minuteing down the many conspicuous providences of God, which have appeared to me in times of trouble; but like ungrateful Israel, I went the only way to forget his work and to be unmindful of the rock of my salvation, and now I have nothing to trust to, on this creation but my own treacherous memory, unless the Lord be pleased to send the comforter to me, and if he comes he will bring all things to my remembrance, whatever God hath said unto me in the way of providence. I am sure the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world and all that is thereon, all the cattle of the forest are his and so are the flocks of a thousand hills, yea, the corn and the wine, the oil thereof, and the flax; yea, the wicked deceiver as well as the deceived are the Lord's, and it is he that maketh one man poor and another rich, that bringeth down and lifteth up, and no man can add to the fixed statute of God whether the statute be in grace or providence. The battle, saith the wise man, is not to the strong nor the race to the swift, nor bread to men of skill, the weak are often sure to win the field and the cripple to win the heavenly race, and even fools to accumulate the greatest fortunes. There is no adding a cubit to the statute even in the least circumstance, then why take ye thought for the rest? and now the reader will please to take notice by pursuing these pages, that it should be attended by much prayer; feeling myself small among men and particularly to the learned, when considering my inability; I can make out to write my name, but being impressed by the spirit of God for some years to set before you life and death, in the way of a small treatise, and I hope that it will prove the happy power of God unto salvation to many souls. Many of the readers of this pamphlet may suppose this attempt was attended with a great deal of self, but my blessed master who stands at the helm of affairs to them that love and serve him, I often times say, as Moses said, “thou God seest me,” also it is likely this treatise may fall into the hands of the critic, if so I pray to my God while he is a criticising that God may break down his obdurate heart if not a christian, and that his chains may fly off although they are made fast by the devil, likeunto the man that Christ spake unto “come out of the man thou unclean spirit,” see Mark 3 ch. 8 vs. also this treatise may fall into the hands of some enemy to the cross of Christ, if so, I hope they will take in consideration the things that makes for their everlasting peace, now hold fast all things that are good, and if there is any thing that will not be beneficial throw it away and do not stumble over it and go down to hell, for I love your souls although I am of the Ethiopian race, and never had the chance of being taught in the Colleges or Academies and taught the rudiments and sciences &amp;c. unlike to Paul who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; one of the judges of the Sanhedren, neither like our great men of America who have been taught all these rudiments and are now capable of taking their station in any department of life standing at the head of affairs; but such as my God gave unto me, I will with all pleasure give it unto you so that you may stand fast in the liberty where Christ has made you free, for these things are commanded, and let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity, see Tim. 4 ch. 11, 12 vs. I have one more requesting desire in my heart that has been there may years, ever since I began preaching the gospel, which has never yet been granted though I really believe it will in God's own time and way, and when it is accomplished perhaps my dear friends may hear from me again, till then farewell, be of good comfort, live in peace and the God of peace shall be with you, amen, amen. Even thine in faith and affection, N. CALWELL CANNON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A WEDDING HYMN. 1 Since Jesus freely did appear To grace a marriage feast: O Lord, we ask thy presence here To make a wedding guest. 2 With gifts of grace their hearts endue, Who now have plighted their hands: On every soul assembled here, O make thy face to shine. 3 As Isaac and Rebecca give A pattern chaste and kind: So may this married couple live, And die in faith divine. HYMN 1. Long Metre. [Say which of you would see the Lord?] 1 Say which of you would see the Lord? You all may now obtain his grace. Behold him in the written word! Where John unveils the Saviour's face: 2 Clear as the trumpet's voice he speaks To every soul that turns his ear: Amidst the golden candlesticks He walks, and lo! now he is here. 3 Present to all believing souls They see him with an eagle eye; Down to his feet a garment rolls, Stained with a glorious crimson die. 4 A golden girdle binds his breast, Wher'er streams of consolation flow, Milk for his new born babes, who rest In him, nor other's comforts know. 5 His form is as the son of man: His eyes are as a flame of fire: They dart a sin consuming pain, And life and joy divine inspire. 6 His spotless purity of soul, We by a lovely emblem know. His head and hair are white as wool: White are they as the dropping snow. 7 Glitter his feet, like polished brass That long hath in the furnace shown; Brighter than lightning is his face: Brighter than the meridian sun. 8 As many waters, sounds his word: Seven stars he holds in his right hand: Out of his mouth a two-edged sword Goes forth before it: who can stand! 9 Lord, at thy feet we fall as dead: Lay thy right hand upon our souls, Scatter our fears: thy spirit shed, And all our unbelief control. 10 Tell us, “I am the first and last: Who liveth and died for all. Am I! And lo! my better death is past; And lo! I live: no more to die. 11 I have the keys of death and hell. Amen.” Thy record we receive, And wait till thou our spirits seal, And all in all forever live. HYMN 2. Common Metre. [Let every mortal e're attend] 1 Let every mortal e're attend, And every heart rejoice. The trumpet of the gospel sound, With an inviting voice. 2 Ho, all ye hungry, starving souls That feed upon the wind, And vainly strive with earthly toys To fill an empty mind. 3 Eternal wisdom has prepared A soul reviving feast, And bids your longing appetite The rich provision taste. 4 Ho ye, that pant for living streams, And pine away and die, Here you may quench your raging thirst, With springs that never dry. 5 Rivers of love and mercy here, In a rich ocean join. Salvation in abundance flows Like floods of milk and wine. 6 Come naked, and adorn your soul In robes prepared by God, Wrought by the labors of his son, And died in his own blood. 7 The happy gates of gospel grace Stand open night and day. Lord, we have come to seek supply And drive our wants away. HYMN 4. Short Metre. [See what a living stone] 1 See what a living stone The builders did refuse, Yet God hath built his church thereon In spite of envious Jews. 2 The Scribes and angry Priests Reject thine only son, Yet on this rock shall Zion rest, As the chief corner stone. 3 The work, O Lord, is thine, And wonders in our eyes, This day declares it all divine: This day did Jesus rise. 4 This is the glorious day That our Redeemer made, Let us rejoice and sing and pray: Let all the church be glad. 5 Hosannah to the King Of David's royal blood; Bless him, ye saints, he comes to bring Salvation from your God. 6 We bless thy holy word. Which all his grace displays, And offer on thine altar, Lord, Our sacrifice of praise. HYMN 6. Long Metre. [Life is the time to serve the Lord] 1 Life is the time to serve the Lord: The time to insure the great reward; And while the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may return. 2 Life is the hour that God has given, To escape from hell and fly to heaven: The day of grace, and mortals may Secure the blessings of the day. 3 The living know that they must die: But all the dead forgotten lie; Their memory and their sense is gone, Alike unknowing and unknown. 4 Their hatred and their love is lost: Their envy buried in the dust: They have no share in all that's done Beneath the circuit of the sun. 5 Then what my thoughts design to do, My hands with all your might pursue: Since no device, nor work is found, Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground: 6 There is no acts of pardon past In the cold grave to which we haste: But darkness, death and long despair Reign, in eternal silence there. HYMN 7. 1 Day of judgment—day of wonder, Hark! the trumpet's awful sound, Louder than a thousand thunders, Shakes the vast creation round, How the Summons! Will the sinners heart confound! 2 See the Judge, our nature wearing Cloth'd in majesty divine. Ye who long for his appearing; Then shall I say this God is mine: Gracious Saviour Own me in that day for thine. 3 At his call the dead awaken: Arise to life from earth and sea, All the powers of nature shaken. By his look prepare to fly: Careless sinners What will then become of thee! 4 Horrors past imagination, Will surprise your trembling heart When you hear your condemnation, “Hence accursed wretch, depart! Thou with Satan And his angels has thy part! 5 But to those who have confessed, Loved and served the Lord helow, He will say come, come near ye blessed, See the kingdom I bestow, You forever Shall my love and glory know. 6 Under sorrows and reproaches, May this thought our courage raise. Swiftly God's great day approaches; Sighing shall then be changed to praise, May we triumph When the world is in a blaze! HYMN 8. Long Metre. [How great, how terrible that God] 1 How great, how terrible that God, Who shakes creation with his rod— He frowns—earth, sea—all nature's frame, Sinks in one universal flame. 2 Where now, O! whence shall sinners seek For shelter in the general wreck! Shall falling rocks be o'er them thrown? See rocks like snow, dissolving down. 3 Methinks the last great day is come: Methinks I hear the trumpet sound, That shakes the earth—rends every tomb, And wakes the prisoners under ground. 4 Lord, when these awful leaves unfold, May life's fair book, my soul approve: There may I read my name enrold, And triumph in redeeming love. 5 Jesus, the helpless creature's friend, To thee my all, I dare commend, Thou can'st preserve my feeble soul, When lightnings blaze from pole to pole. HYMN 9. Common Metre. [Let Zion's watchmen all awake] 1 Let Zion's watchmen all awake And take the alarm they give: Now let them from the mouth of God, The awful charge receive. 2 'Tis not a cause of small import, The pastor's care demands, But what might fill an angel's heart: And fill a Saviour's hand. 3 They watch for souls for which the Lord Did heavenly bless'd forego: For souls which must forever live In raptures or in wo! 4 All to the great tribunal haste, Their account to render there, And should'st thou strictly mark our faults, Lord, where should we appear! 5 May they that Jesus, whom they preach, Their own Redeemer see, And watch thou daily o'er their souls, That they may watch for thee, HYMN 10. Common Metre. [Lo! what a glorious sight appears] 1 Lo! what a glorious sight appears To our believing eyes! The earth and see are passed away, And the old rolling skies. 2 From the third heavens where God resides: That holy and happy place, The New Jerusalem comes down, Adorned with shining grace. 3 Attending angels shout for joy, And the bright armies sing, “Mortals, behold! the sacred seat Of your descending King.” 4 My shepard is the living Lord, Now shall my wants be well supplied, His providence and holy word Becomes my safety and my guide. 5 In pastures where salvation grow, He makes me food—he makes me rest— There living waters gently flow, And all the food divinely blessed. 6 My wandering feet his ways mistake, But he restores my soul to peace, And leads me for his mercy's sake, In the fair path of righteousness. 7 Though I walk through the gloomy vale, Where death and all its terrors are, My heart and hope shall never fail: For God, my Shepard, 's with me there. 8 His own soft hand shall wipe the tear From every weeping eye, And pains and groans, and grief and fear, And death itself shall die. 9 How long, dear Saviour, O! how long! Shall this bright hour delay? Fly-swift around ye wheels of time, And bring the welcome day. HYMN 11. Common Metre. [My Shepard will supply my needs] 1 My Shepard will supply my needs: Jehovah is his name! In pastures fresh, he makes me feed Beside the living streams. 2 He brings my wandering spirit back, When I forsake his ways, And leads me for his mercy's sake In paths of truth and grace. 3 When I walk through the shades of death, Thy presence is my stay. A word of thy supporting breath Drives all my fears away. 4 Thy hand, in sight of all my foes Doth still my table spread; My cup with blessings overflow Thine oil-annointing head. 5 The sure provision of my God Attends me all my days; O, may thy house be mine abode, And all my works be praise. 6 To each the covenant blood apply Which takes our sin away, And registers our names on high, And keep us to that day. 7 There would I find a settled rest, While others go and come; No more a stranger nor a guest: But like a child at home. HYMN 12. Of the Christian's Barbarity. [Was stolen and sold from Africa] 1 Was stolen and sold from Africa, Imported to America: Like the brute beasts at market sold, To stand the heat and bear the cold. When will Jehovah hear our cries! And free the sons of Africa. 2 They bear the lash—endure the pain— Forced through frost, hail, snow and rain, And often-night sleep on the ground, No freedom till, the grave is found, We pray Jehovah will hear our cries, And relieve the sons of Africa. 3 Working all day and half the night, And up before the morning light; Exposed to hardships, heat and cold, And if they beg they meet with scold. We pray Jehovah to plead our cause, And put in force his righteous laws. 4 Their skins are dark, their hair is short: Shall dying men make them trade and sport! In sorrow draging iron chains; Depriv'd of all the rights of men. O, great Redeemer, view their wrong, And grant them aid e'er it be long. 5 But He that rides upon the storms, Whose voice in thunder rolls along: In his own time will make a way To relieve the oppressed of Africa. O, Prince of Glory be their friend! And keep them faithful to the end. HYMN. Long Metre. [Thy name, Almighty Lord] 1 Thy name, Almighty Lord, Shall sound through distant lands; Great is thy grace, and sure is thy word: Thy truth forever stands. 2 Far be thine honor spread, And long thy praise endure, Till morning light and evening shade, Shall be exchanged no more. HYMN 13. Common Metre. [Lo! wisdom stands with smiling face] 1 Lo! wisdom stands with smiling face, And courts us to her arms: Who can resist the wondrous grace, And slight her powerful charms! 2 She, gen'rous, holds out to our sight Riches which shall endure: Not sparkling rubies half so bright: Nor finest gold so pure. 3 Eternal pleasures fill her train: Pleasures that never decay. Come drink of bliss unmixed with pain, And haste celestial joy. 4 Immortal crowns she now displays, And thrones beyond the skies; Accept her blessing while she stays, And seize the glorious prize. HYMN 14. 1 Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims For all the pious dead; Sweet is the Saviour of their names, And soft their sleeping bed. 2 They die in Jesus and are bless'd; How kind their slumbers are, From sufferings and from sin released, And freed from every snare. 3 Far from this world of toil and strife, They're present with the Lord; The labors of their mortal life End in a large reward. HYMN 15. 1 These glorious souls, how bright they shine! Whence all their white array! How come they to the happy seats Of everlasting day! 2 From torturing pains to endless joys, On fiery chariots they ride, And strangely wash'd their raiment white In Jesus' dying blood. 3 Now they approach their Lord, And bow before his throne, Their warbling harps and sacred songs Adore the Holy One. 4 The unveiled glories of his face, Among his saints reside, While the rich treasures of his grace, Sees all their wants supplied. 5 Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls And hunger flee as fast; The fruit of life's immortal tree, Shall be their sweet repast. HYMN 16. 1 Death may dissolve my body now, And bear my spirit home; Why do my minutes move so slow? Nor my salvation come. 2 With heaveuly weapons I have fought The battles of the Lord; Finish'd my course and kept the faith And wait the sure reward. 3 God has laid up in heaven for me, A crown which cannot fade; The righteous Judge at that great day, Shall place it on my head. 4 Nor hath the King of grace decreed, This prize for me alone; But all that love and long to see, The appearance of his Son. 5 Jesus the Lord shall guard me safe From every ill design, And to his heavenly kingdom take This feeble soul of mine. 6 God is my everlasting aid And hell shall rage in vain; To Him be highest glory paid, And endless praise. Amen. THE ARK. Dear brothers and sisters, we love one another, And have done, for years that have gone; How often we've met him in sweet heavenly union, Who opens the way to God's throne; With joy and thanksgiving we'll praise him that lov'd us, While we run the bright shining way; Though we part here in body, we're bound for one glory, And bound for each other to pray. There Joshua and Joseph, Elias and Moses, Who pray'd and God heard from his throne. There was Abram, and Isaac, and Jacob, and David, And Solomon, Stephen and John. There was Simeon and Anna—I don't know how many, Who pray'd as they journey'd along; Some cast among lions—some bound with rough irons; Yet praises and glory they sung. Some tell us that praying, and also that praising, Is labor that's all spent in vain: But we have such witness, that God hears with sweetness; From praying we will not refrain. There was old father Noah and ten thousand more, Who witness'd that God heard them pray; There was Samuel and Hannah, Paul, Silas and Peter, And Daniel and Jonah, we'll say, That God by his Spirit, and angel did visit Their souls while in this happy frame. Shall we all go a fainting, while they went a praising, And glorified God in a flame! God grant us inherit the same praying spirit, While we shall be toiling below, That when we've done praying, we shall not cease praising; But around God's throne we shall bow. [And now pious friends, when you read these lines which have been penned by me, think of me in solemn prayer; let me be on land or sea, I intend to stand for liberty, for Christ has set me free.] For this love let rocks and mountains; Purling streams and crystal fountains; Roaring thunders, lightning blazes, Shout the great Messiah's praises. Amen.</field>
