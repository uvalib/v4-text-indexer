      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE Life of the Author. Mrs. Josie D. (Henderson) Heard was born in Salisbury, North Carolina, October 11, 1861. Her parents, Lafavette and Annie M. Henderson, though slaves, were nominally free, being permitted to hire their time and live in another city, Charlotte, North Carolina. At an early age, Josephine displayed her literary taste, and aptness to perform upon almost any musical instrument. As early as five years of age she could read, and was a source of general comfort to the aged neighbors, delighting to read the Scriptures to them. She received her education in the schools at Charlotte, and having passed through them with credit, was sent to the Scotia Seminary at Concord, North Carolina, spending several years there. Her desire was to reach even a higher plain, and she was next sent to Bethany Institute, New York, passing with honors from its walls. She commenced teaching in the State which gave her birth; then in the State of South Carolina, at Maysville, Orangeburg and finally in Tennessee, at Covington, near Memphis. In October, 1881, she became acquainted with the Rev. W. H. Heard, now the pastor of Allen Temple, Atlanta, Ga., who was then in the U. S. R. Mail Service; and they were happily united in the Bonds of Matrimony in the year 1882. Mrs. Heard evinced a fondness for poetry, and during her school days contributed to several leading evangelical periodicals. After her marriage she was encouraged by the Rt. Rev. Benj. Tucker Tanner, Rt. Rev. B. W. Arnett, and many other friends, to give more time to it. At their solicitations she has ventured to bring to light these verses. She has some musical talent, having composed and written a piece of music which was played at the New Orleans Exposition, and which elicited much comment from the Democratic Press of the South. W. H.

      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. A first edition of any work is an expression of the author's confidence in the public; a second is a grateful acknoledgment that this confidence has been rewarded with the public favor. With the rapid multiplying of writers which the present day is bringing to us, there is altogether too little that is heart poetry. Clever verse and faithful dialect, broad humor and irreverent wit, may serve the purpose of a bread-winner and wake the ephemoral favor of the volatile and mercurial; but the deep souls that transmute their feeling into better lives, and whose present approval means to the writer worthiness of future respect, will ever turn from the lighter vein to commune with those who love God and man, who muse upon life, its ties and mysteries, and there rest themselves. Pope and Goldsmith, with the glittering rapier of pencil wit and keen retort, are not great. One “Deserted Village” outweighs a dozen “Retaliations,” and one “Essay on Man” is more than a dozen “Dunciads.” Mrs. Heard's muse is sacred and sentimental. She appeals to the best in us. Where there is no response, the mansion of the soul is falling into ruins. Nor is she devoid of the power to use the scalpel of sarcasm and wit, as witness in her “Time and Things Have Changed,” which is a clever and scathing review of the frivolities of the times. Altogether, Mrs. Heard's poems are salutary and wholesome. They breathe true faith and tender love to God. They are pre-eminently poems for the home. Your child and mine will be deeper, more devout, and more soulful followers of God from their persual. And the fervor that breathes in them all, telling of a woman's heart inditing with a poet's hand, is needed in these shallow nineteenth century lives that have been let loose upon the world, to bring them into the true estate of human rather than animal living. It is true neither the furor of a fad, nor the childish acclamations of the thoughtless will attend the publishing of that whose power is in its peacefulness and purity; but a more enduring if more tardy judgment will place a chaplet unfading upon the writer who scorns the populartiy of pandering. Dedicated to friendship, to love, to virtue and to God as “Morning Glories” is, it needs not my approval to win its way, though that approval it has; it needs not the censor in the home to prove its pages, for it is all good; it can well disregard the carless glances of palsied character, for its fate is in the verdict of the good; its mission to the ones who have not forgotten home and mother and who have still the right to hope for happiness and heaven; and these are to be known by their power to feel what is here written. T. H. KEALING. Philadelphia, June 5, 1901.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART FIRST. POEMS, Sentimental and Sacred, Couplets, Etc. RETROSPECT. I sat alone at my window, While the pattering raindrops brought Along with their music upon the roof. A lengthy train of thought. I stepped aboard of it quickly, And rapidly on I sped, Away to the scenes of my childhood days, I followed where fancy led. I roamed the fragrant meadow, And through the silent wood; At last I came to the babbling brook, And sadly there I stood. Into its clear water gazing I felt a strange, sweet spell Enthral my being slowly As o'er my life it fell. I saw in the waters merry, Dear faces of long ago, That had drifted away on the sea of life, As the winds blew loud or low. My brain grew dazed with horror, And my heart was wrung with pain; Some barks were dashed on a rock-bound coast, They could not return again. I saw the same old mill-pond, And beside it the noisy mill, And once again I heard the bell Of the old Church on the hill. There was the dear old Schoolhouse, The scene of my childhood joys, And in the yard I romped among The happy girls and boys. And once again came “May Day,” When the fields were dressed in green, And roses shed their rich perfume, The children crowned me Queen. I saw again our own sweet home Half hidden 'mong the trees, My parents, brother, sisters and I, As happy and busy as bees. Around the door of the homestead, The sweet Wistaria vines, And on the old oak in the yard The clinging ivy twines. There stands the grim old court-house, And the Jail with dingy cells, And on the Church the old town-clock The fleeting moment tells. Next I came to the old town Graveyard And entered with silent tread, And dropped a tear o'er the grassy grave Of the peacefully sleeping dead. TO WHITTIER. In childhood's sunny day my heart was taught to love Thy name, all other poet's names above, And when to womanhood at last I came, Behold the spark was fanned into a flame, Nor did I dare presume that I should live, And to the honored, white-haired poet give My sentiment in rude constructed rhyme; O wondrous change wrought by the hand of time! When he who came the slaves among to dwell, From frigid Idaho (we loved him well), Athirst for knowledge I stood at his side, With quickening thought and eyes astonished, wide. He nightly read, and held me on his knee, From Whittier's “Snowbound” filling me with glee. The seed sown by his hand in infant heart, Has lived and grown, and cannot now depart. Now to the sunset thou hast set thy face, And silvery crown thy head doth grace; The mind of fertile thought doth not decline Preserved yet from the ravages of time Since I can never hope my first desire, To shake thy hand, which would my soul inspire, Now ere yet “the cord is lossed or pitcher broken,” Grant me with thine own hand this little token: Ere yet that hand by feebleness grows lame, With condescension write for me thy name. WELCOME TO HON. FREDERICK DOUGLASS. Charleston, S. C. Mt. Zion Church, March 5th, 1888. Our hearts are filled with pride to-day— We hail thee, Noble Sire, Stern prejudice is swept away By Freedom's cleansing fire. And o'er this Southland you may roam, With ne'er a cause to fear— We bid the, Welcome to our home, Welcome, and right good cheer! From rugged Blue Ridge mountain peak, To ocean's white crest wave: Even infant lips thy praises speak, And boast thy deeds so brave. The bondsman's fetters long since broke And tossed aside by thee, Thou hurldest off the cursed yoke, And panted to be free. We see thee in thy craddle-bed, Thy mother's pride and joy; When from oppression's hand you fled, When but a strippling boy. Thou, Moses of the negro race, This day we hail with pride; The day that brings us face to face, And Douglass by our side. We note thy locks have turned to grey, But note with swelling pride, For thou hast come a weary way O'er troubles deep and wide. God led thee then, and leads thee now, No longer art thou sad— And may many years yet crown thy brow, To make thy people glad. THE PARTING KISS. We were waiting at the station, Soon the cars would surely start, Hearts beat high with love's emotion, For we knew we soon must part. On dark lashes seemed to glisten Tiny crystal tear drops shine; To the fond voice glad I listen, While dear eyes look into mine. And the last words quickly spoken, Darling, still to me be true, Let your promise be unbroken, For I will be true to you. Once I felt the soft hand tremble, And my heart throbbed with its bliss; Lips that rose-buds did resemble, Met in one last loving kiss. Sweet good-bye, do not forget me, Spoken in the softest tone, In your mem'ry, precious keep me, For my love is all your own. I will ever be brave-hearted— Nothing shall your love efface: One last kiss and then we parted, One last loving, long embrace. THE QUESTION. Does he think of me in the merry throng Which surrounds his board to-night? Is his love as true, and his faith as strong, As it was at this morning's light? Am I first in his thought; is he still as fond; And is his heart longing to flee From its weary thraldom, and burst its bond, To spend but a moment with me? Can he look on the faces of women fair, And turn from them all to me? From halls where sweet music is filling the air, Would he come and be happy with me? From the feast of reason and flow of soul, And walls resounding with glee; From the crimson goblet and flowing bowl, Is he giving one thought of me? Ah! yes, on the wings of the night breeze come Such tidings of comfort to me. Rest well, little Queen! his heart is thy throne, Who sends this message to thee: “Thou need'st not fear, though in gilded halls Of pleasure and chivalry, Thy lover wouldst fly from the mirthful walls To spend one sweet moment with thee.” Yest, he thinks of me in the crowded mart, And the thought cheers him on his way; I read in his eyes the desire of his heart, As he passes me day by day. What more could I ask, what wish while I live, Than the love he has lavished so free? This world has no worthier boon to give Than my handsome young lover to me. FAREWELL TO ALLEN UNIVERSITY. “CLASS SONG OF '87.” Tune “America.” We leave thy courts to-day, Joyful has been our stay Within thy walls. Hence lie our paths apart, Tears will unbidden start, While we with aching heart Shall leave thy halls. 'Twas here our wont to meet, Fondly each other greet, Each rising day. United prayers ascend For Teacher, Parent, Friend, And joyful notes would blend In tuneful lay. Bright may thy glories shine, On all who at thy shrine Will meekly stay. Loudly thy praises tell! Loud hallelujahs swell, While we on earth shall dwell, We homage pay. Dear “Allen,” now to you, Classmates and Teachers too, Farewell is said. Still on that brighter shore, When all life's cares are o'er, We'll meet and part no more, With Christ our head. NIGHT. The shades of eve are quickly closing in, And streaks of silver gild the eastern sky; Belated songsters have their vespers sung With happy hearts and silvery noted tongue, The busy world has ceased its toil and din. And guardian angels now their watch begin. All nature quiet save the sighing wind, And distant murmur of the ocean wave, Which seem engaged a requiem to sing O'er blighted hopes and expectations grave. The drooping heart its lonely vigil keeps, Beside the tomb where proud ambition sleeps. But memory bids defiance unto sleep, And from her quiet chamber, see her creep, Away she flies o'er hill, and dale and mead, To find the Sacred City of the dead; Faints not, nor stops to seek a rest, Till pillowed on some loved and lost one's breast. THE PARTING. The die is cast, and we must part, Forgive me if I say we must; Must make again exchange of heart, But never more exchange of trust. With faces cold and stern must meet, While inward fires consume our souls, Must pass as strangers in the street, While o'er our hope the death bell tolls. We met but a short while ago, And all my sky was clouded o'er; You loved, and scattered all my woe, Loved as I ne'er was loved before. You taught my hungry heart to hope, And filled love's chalice to the brim, But hope must now in darkness grope, And love's sweet sunshine e'er be dim. When eventide has wrapped the world In garments of a silvery sheen, And diamond studded skies unfurled Their beauty fair to deek the Queen Of night, as she shall joyous ride In magic splendor on her way, Like modest, sweet and happy bride, All glorious in her perfect sway. My thoughts unfettered fly to thee, Untramelled by my heart's deep woe, Though all our actions guarded be, Love's tender voice still murmurs low, And fans the embers into flame, My heart thrills with its ecstasy At any mention of thy name; Forgets, and longs to be with thee. Yet we must smile and kiss the rod That strikes the blow and severs us, Must fix our hope on heaven and God, Earth's joys are ever severed thus. Farewell, and though we parted be, And parting brings us bitter pain, Some day we shall united be, For we must hope to live again. When all our wrongs have righted been, And crooked paths have been made straight, When from our joys shall drop the screen, Which now is hung by cruel fate, When the full craving of each heart Is granted, we shall happy be When meeting we shall no more part, In the blissful realm eternity. ASSURANCE. I know that his eyes look into mine, With a joy tongue cannot tell, And I drink of the cup of love's sweet wine, And my heart says, “All is Well.” I know his heart is all my own, Enchained by love's sweet spell, That I reign as a Queen on a golden throne, And my heart says all is well. HOPE. Hope! Thou vain, delusive maiden, Every moment cometh laden, With some fresher, newer fancies, Which before our vison glances, Filling hearts already burning With a deeper, stronger yearning; Adding fuel to the fires, Waking all the soul's desires. Nectar holdeth to our lip, Yet forbiddeth us a sip. O thou lovely, fickle jade, Fools of men hast ever made. We thy fleeting footsteps follow, O'er the mountain in the hollow; In the glade or through the dell Captives bound by thy sweet spell. Tyrant Queen, what power is thine! Prince and Peasant at thy shrine, For thy favor each imploring Though thy coquettish alluring. Pointing with thy finger gentle To fair Fame's or Croesus' temple, On thou leadest ever smiling Over rugged roads beguiling. Youth and maiden, sire and sage, All in thy mad flight engage; There's a better name for thee— Disappointment it should be. “FAME.” What's in a name? What's in a name? Some Ancient writers ask. In truth to tell what's in a name, We find no easy task; Yet each and every noble deed Helps build the house of fame; And upon every block of stone, We carve some Hero's name. So let us live, while life is spared, In duty's sunshine fair, Our names shall be like temples reared, Not “Castles in the Air.” “TRUTH.” For T. M. D. W. Look up, dear one, nor be cast down, For bright again will shine thy sun; God's smiles are hid behind his frown— Trust Him, He will dispel thy gloom. SUNSHINE AFTER CLOUD. Come, “Will,” let's be good friends again, Our wrongs let's be forgetting, For words bring only useless pain, So wherefore then be fretting. Let's lay aside imagined wrongs, And ne'er give way to grieving, Life should be filled with joyous songs, No time left for deceiving. I'll try and not give way to wrath, Nor be so often crying; There must some thorns be in our path, Let's move them now by trying. How, like a foolish pair were we, To fume about a letter; Time is so precious, you and me Must spend ours doing better. SLUMBERING PASSION. Can it be true, that we can meet, As other strangers in the street; No deep emotions quickly rise, No hidden language in our eyes, No sudden crimson-mantled cheek, No thrilling word of pleasure speak? Yes! Thine was love of yesterday; This morning found it far away, In search of newer conquests gone, Leaving me desolate and lone, In vain I sought to break the spell, My strenuous efforts fruitless fell. The cloud o'erspread my sunny sky, And settled slowly like a pall, And clad my life in misery, And swept it clear of pleasures all, Remembrance brings me only pain, My love, my truest love lies slain. Henceforth in loneliness I grope My way, until my life shall end; Among the hopeful without hope, Among the friendly without friend— My heart unto its depth is shaken, My love, untiring love forsaken. THE ADVANCE OF EDUCATION. What means this host advancing With such melodious strain; These men on steeds a prancing, This mighty marshaled train? They come while drum and fife resound, And steeds with foam aflecked, Whose restless feet do spurn the ground, Their riders gaily decked. With banners proudly waving, Fearless in Freedom's land, All opposition braving, With courage bold they stand. Come join the raging battle, Come join the glorious fray; Come spite of bullets' rattle, This is enlistment day. Hark! hear the Proclamation Extend o'er all the land; Come every Tribe and Nation Join education's band. Now the command is given— Strike! strike grim ignorance low; Strike till her power is riven; Strike a decisive blow. MOTHER. Who was it held me on her knee? When I was helpless as could be, And hoped such noble things of me? My Mother. Who taught my infant lips to prat, And understood my childish chat, And who in patience calmly sat? My Mother. Who watched me grow from day to day, Taught me “Our Father's prayer” to say, And kept me out of evil's way? My Mother. Who shared my sorrow and my grief, And always brought me sweet relief; Of all my friends who was the chief? My Mother. Who always wisest council gave, And taught me how life's storms to brave, That I might safely ride each wave? My Mother. Who guarded me from tempter's snare, Made me the burden of her prayer, And watched with zealous tender care? My Mother. And when the sun dies in the west, And birds fly homeward to their nest, On whose fond bosom would I rest? My Mother's. THE OUTCAST. With pinched cheeks hollow and wan, With feet all travel sore, A form so fragile, that one might span Her waist. There she peers in each door. A dress, that is scarcely a dress at all— No hat to protect her head; The matted brown hair speaks woe and despair, As daily she begs for bread. No shoes to cover her feet, No table with bounties spread, No home but a stoop in a wretched street, And naught but rags for a bed. One glance at the hungry face, One look at the shattered frame Would prove that her life has been but a race With poverty, hunger and shame. The hurrying crowd swept by, On business or pleasure intent— No time to give heed to a cry of need, No help to the beggar lent. Oh! Men with purse-string tight, And women of comfort and ease, Have you no pity this bitter night, Her hunger and want to apease? She knelt on the flagstones in prayer, With uplifted heart unto heaven; A pitying angel discovered her there, And whispered so kindly: “Forgiven!” The morning's sun looked on the face Of her who had known naught but pain, So peaceful in death, not even a trace Of hunger and suffering remain. THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1886. With angry brow and stately tread This mighty Warrior came; With thundering throat his forces led, With breath almost aflame. And eyes of penetrating glance, That pierce through every vein, As soldier pierced by soldier's lance, Earth groaned and writhed in paid. The fearless eagle in his nest Upon the mountain's height, Arose with wonder in his breast, And quivered with affright. Old ocean troubled in his bed, At first the shore forsook— Returning, all his furies led, And crept into each nook. Brave-hearted men like statutes stood Powerless to strike a blow; Their homes became as kindling wood, Their city's wall laid low. While mothers clasped their babes in arms And sped with panting breath; With faces full of dread alarm, They sought to fly from death. Husband and wife in long embrace In mutest wonder stood; Each horror read in other's face, And knelt and prayed to God. Death reaped a harvest as he rode, On wings of every wind; He slew the young, the brave and good, And some grown old in sin. The very stars their light refused To witness scene like this; Fair Lunar hid away confused, And veiled herself in mist. Roar after roar, peal after peal, The fierce bombardment went, Till nature like a drunkard reeled, Her strongest breastworks rent. “Surrender!” comes from every lip; “We yield,” from every breast; Ourselves of selfishness now stript, We are humbled in the dust. In meek humility we bowed And smiling kissed the rod, That while it smote us, bore us up Near to the throne of God. TO YOUTH. How shall your name go down in History, In letters of gold, or enveloped in mystery; In deeds of love, on pages of white, In defense of the wrong, in lieu of right— In a selfish way will you carve your name? Time surely will answer: What's in a name? The leaves of your life each day are unfolding Your deeds of to-day; to-morrow beholding, May tint your cheek with the blush of shame, While your heart will question: What's in a name? Will you gather the jewels spread out at your feet, Or still with the idle ones find a seat? No definite cause in the world pursuing— In the idle brain mischief is ever brewing— Can you find no work in the market-place, Can you not with the horsemen contend in the race; If the footmen outstrip you who is to blame? Be careful in youth how you carve your name. ON “GENESSARET.” Out upon the deep old ocean, Out upon the trackless wave, Tossed by winds in fierce commotion— Men with hearts no longer brave— Drifted a poor helpless vessel, Driven by the winds at will; Struggling sailors with her wrestle, Lest they watery graves should fill. All night long they toiled in rowing, Striving their frail bark to guide— Morning's streaks were longer growing, Still she tossed from side to side. Some were on the oars hard bending, Others strove to man the sail, But each moment strength seemed lending To the e'er increasing gale. Silently each weary seaman Did the task to him assigned; Helpless starboard watch, and leamen Scanned the trackless waste behind. Fainter grew their hearts within them, For the billows threatened death, Furious breakers fought to win them, Prayers were uttered with each breath. Denser grew the clouds above them, And the tempest wildly raged, Weary Captain, hopeless seamen, Each in silent prayer engaged. Sudden on the wave appearing Breaks a strange mysterious light, Toward their little bark 'tis nearing, And they tremble with affright. “'Tis a spirit,” said they lowly, Terror on their faces spread, But he neared them, speaking slowly— “It is I!” be not afraid. Peter spake, (the all-impulsive) Jesus come Thy people save, If indeed thou art our Jesus, “Bid me walk upon the wave!” “Come unto me!” said the Saviour! Peter made a noble start, But ere long his strength forsook him— Doubting filled his faithless heart. In his own strength he was thinking He would walk upon the wave— Soon he found that he was sinking, Then he cried, “Lord Jesus Save!” Then the loving Saviour caught him, And unto the vessel came; Peace now reigned, and Jesus taught him, Not thy power, but Jesus' name. Sinner, you are on the ocean, Sinking down beneath the wave, Stretch thine arms with faith's devotion— Jesus Christ is quick to save! HE COMES NOT TO-NIGHT. My eager waiting heart can bear no more— Hark! was that not his knock upon the door, Or, that his footstep on the casement floor? Ah, no, the clock rings out the hour, 'tis nine, 'Tis past his hour and dreary waiting's thine Sad heart, he will not come to-night. With anxious eyes, the gloom I strive to pierce, The stars are hid and winds are howling fierce; Only the ticking of the clock I hear, No welcome footsteps greet my eager ear. 'Tis long since past his hour, vain waiting thine Sad heart, he will not come to-night. From nature's fount the crystal tear drops flow, They soothe the throbbing heart's cry low, O, heart thine is the common, common fate, Thou yet must learn to hope and wait, 'Tis long since past his hour, vain waiting thine Sad heart, he will not come to-night. WELCOME HOME. To Mrs. Fannie Jackson Coppin, returning from England. Thy weary feet have pressed once more thy native soil, After the weeks and days of care and toil, And loyal hearts whose friendship ever is true, Have come to bid a Welcome Home to you. Our bosoms swelling with an honest pride, As swells the lover's heart who claims his bride, With pleasure and with joy, we grasp thy hand And bid thee welcome to thy native land. Like silvery star that glint and gleams at night, Gladdening the wanderer's heart who seeks the light, Like France who turned to her Joan of Arc, We follow thee to victory from the dark. Even though the call was made from distant land, “Come join us, sisters of the Missionary Band.” The bugle sound fell on thy willing ear, And to thy faithful bosom came no fear. And waiting not to rate the fearful cost, In duty's call absorbed, all else is lost; Through heat or cold, where'er thy path hath led, Thine energies were bent, thy footsteps sped. The fearless heart that knew not how to falter, Laid quick thine all on sacrificial altar, The dear ones of thy heart, thy friends and home, And dared to brave old ocean's turbid foam. For thee, the much oppressed Hammitic race, Must justly claim a worthy heroine's place, With those whose courage ne'er was known to flank, Place Fanny Jackson Coppin in the foremost rank. And may thy noble deeds be told in verse and song, To those unborn who shall our places throng, When o'er our dust the weeping willow waves, And we shall calmly sleep within our graves. SABBATH BELLS. (Tune, “What a Friend we have in Jesus.”) Sweet and calm the breezes stealing O'er the quiet Sabbath day; Loud and long the church bells pealing, Haste to worship, haste away. List their notes of music swelling, Hark, what tones of melody! Man's redemption they are telling; Haste to worship, haste away. Now the six days' labor ended— Temporal duties laid aside, With our hearts and voices blended, In his courts to-day abide, Since the holy law was broken From his fold, we've gone astray, But the pardoning word was spoken: Erring one, retrace thy way. With the Father interceding For a sin-accursed race, Hands and feet and side all pleading, Jesus saves us by his grace. Sinners, list the bells are ringing, 'Tis the gospel's precious sound; Infants tongues his praises singing, Come, and in his courts be found. In his promise trusting, never Backward cast thy longing eyes; Upward, onward pressing ever, Till the final morn arise. List, the bells are loudly calling, Will you heed the call to-day? On whose ear the sound is falling, Haste to worship, haste away. THE DAY AFTER CONFERENCE. How quiet and how still to-day old Bethel's corners 'round, No boisterous clash of voices, no noisy gavel sound; And those who come from Territory, Island or from State, Who for the glorious cause of Christ came here to legislate. Are gone—and over Bethel hangs a quiet like a pall, And yet there seems to linger strange whisperings in her wall. Perhaps it's but the echo of the meeting that is o'er, Or maybe it's a gathering come from the heavenly shore; Yet they are here and on each face there rests a saddened look, As with their index finger they keep tally in a book. They are gathering up the doings of the Conference that is past, They are making up reports that through eternity shall last. And upon their heavenly faces comes anon a look of shame As with terrible precision they record each member's name. O! ministers of Jesus, have your deeds been foul or fair? If the roll were called in glory, could you guiltless answer there? Could your soul in Jesus' presence, pure and clean and white appear, Or should some foul stain on it condemn you to despair? Shall your tongue shout glad hosannahs at the gathering in of sheaves, Or shall you empty-handed go, no fruit, but only leaves? Shall the Master's loving smile assign you to a mansion bright, Or shall his angry voice appoint you to the realms of night? Look well! for these committees shall report all by and by Before the Great Archbishop in the Conference in the sky. THE QUARREL. I saw him yesterday As he passed upon his way To an fro. Not a single word he spake, Though his heart seemed fit to break; With its woe. I understand his look, Like the pages of a book Which I've read. Oh! however the heart may ache. Back the words we cannot take; Now they're said. How willingly I'd share Half the burden of his care If I might. A word's a cruel thing, And how long we feel the sting; Of a slight, But I love him just the same; Maybe he's not all to blame; Perhaps 'twas me. And I've just received a note, Which with his own hand he wrote; Let me see. Oh! he's coming here to-night, And we'll set the matter right; He'll explain. And we'll love each other better For the mistake in the letter, And the pain. THOU LOVEST ME. Gracious Saviour let me make, Neither error nor mistake— Let me in Thy love abide, Ever near Thy riven side. Let me, counting all things dross, Find my glory in the cross; Let me daily with Thee talk, In Thy footsteps daily walk. I would gladly follow Thee, For Thou gently leadest me, Where the pastures green doth grow, Where the waters stillest flow. For me is Thy table spread, And Thou doth anoint my head, And my cup of joy o'erflows In the presence of my foes. GENERAL ROBERT SMALLS. Beaufort, fair Beaufort, thou art a favored spot, For fate saw fit to cast in thee a noble hero's lot: And we congratulate ourselves as in his house we stand, As welcome guests to one of the most noted in the land. Whose heart is warm as Southern sun, and noble, true and brave, With patriotic fire full and restless as the wave; Whose zeal and candor unconcealed, constrained us to admire; Infused new zeal within our hearts and led us to aspire. And 'mid these grand and gothic walls quite leisurely we saunter, We ask him to rehearse to us the story of the “Planter”— How when the fighting hottest grew, and strong hearts were dismayed, Up to the pilot-house he flew and quick the fears allayed. And though the whistling shot and shell fell thick on every side, His deeds of valor we will tell to Nations yet with pride, To Afric's sons and daughters we'll leave it as no mystery, But hand them down on blocks of stone, and they shall live in history. With Touissant L' Ouverture and Crispus Attuck brave, John Brown and Abram Lincoln, who died to free the slave— They, the nation's martyrs, and each loyal negro's walls Should be adorned with portraints of these and Robert Smalls. ADMIRATION. In the wondrous light of a pair of brown eyes, What language I read in the distance; My soul is suddenly lost in surprise, And can offer therefore on resistance. An easy prey to the magic spell I fall, and am helpless to rise; No subtle power in fairy dell, Than that in those thrilling brown eyes. One moment they quietly rested on me; The next they were wantonly straying; And now they're swimming in ecstasy, Unaware of the havoc they're playing. Just now they are looking quite innocently— A moment before wondrous wise. I would I could fathom the depth of that sea In those thrilling mysterious dark eyes. MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY. So you've reached your thirty-eighth birthday, And by many a varied road— I see that your hair is a trifle gray, But you've toiled with a heavy load Of life's care, and pain, and sorrow, Upon your shoulders broad; You have striven that each to-morrow Found you nearer to heaven and God. What matter if age creepeth o'er you, Your spirit is young, still and bold; The path of duty before you Is paved with the purest of gold, Not such as the brow of a monarch would grace, Eclipsing the costliest gem, That is torn from the bosom of earth's embrace, More precious than diadem. Though many the changes your eyes have seen In these few fast fleeting years, O'er the graves of loved ones (now grown green), You've shed many bitter tears. On life's great sea your bark has tossed, And adverse winds have blown, And threatening clouds your skies have crossed, Yet still the sun has shone. Now down the stream of life you glide, And steer toward setting sun— May each day's close bring sweet repose, As you think on the good you have done. DECORATION DAY. We gather where the weeping willow waves; With flowers we will strew the grassy graves— Who enter here must come with softest tread, In presence of the brave and valiant dead. Come, noble sons of Union, daughters fair; A dirge is floating on the summer air; O'er the city freedom's ensign proudly waves, Come, shed a tear above the fallen braves! Strains of weird music freight the noonday air, And veterans tread the highways here and there. Where peacefully repose the fallen braves, The birds are chanting requiems o'er the graves. No more is heard the cannon's crash and roar, Peace spreads her joyful wings from shore to shore. No more is heard the musket's shower-like hail, And hushed and still the mother's piteous wail. Loud let the drum and fife with music sound, Loud let their praise be echoed all around; Let loyal heart and voice join in the sound; Let infant hands with roses strew the ground. WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? We had gathered for the love-feast on the time appointed night, And many came with hearts aflame and swords all burnished bright; And other heavy laden ones who, toiling on life's road, Forgot that Christ had promised to bear their heavy load, Came struggling in the open door and dropped into a seat, But failed to lay their burdens at the blessed Saviour's feet. We sang the hymn “Redeeming Love,” and then we knelt in prayer, Not knowing that one steeped in sin had gathered with us there; Then we arose and each in turn began of Christ to talk, And some rejoiced and others moaned o'er life's intricate walk; And when the Holy Spirit had pervaded every heart, The weak grew strong, for all their doubts were bidden to depart. We felt that faithful, earnest prayer would unlock heaven's door, Lo, in our very midst, there stood a drunkard on the floor; He'd wandered down the narrow street and stopped and made his bed Upon the steps that to the very mercy-seat had led, Where the thrilling songs of Zion and the atmosphere of prayer, And the host of the invisibles floated on the evening air. They roused him from his stupor, smote his conscience and his heart, For he saw that with “the chosen” even here he had no part; And struggling to control himself and decently appear, He laid aside his tattered hat and to the desk drew near. The muttered words stuck in his throat as hard he strove to speak: “My friends, I've been a drinking,” were uttered low and weak. “Put the man out,” they quickly cried, “how dare he interfere? This is no place for drunkards, only the good are here.” And as the men advanced to take the poor intruder out, He placed his hands behind him and despairing gazed about. There rested such a look upon his now quite sobered face Of hopelessness: it seemed to say, “they thrust me from this place.” Where prayers are made for erring ones. Christ says to all mankind: “That whosoe'er believing comes shall full salvation find.” Strong hands were laid upon him and they led him to the door, And from the church steps down he went perhaps to rise no more. Who knows but that a hasty step his lasting doom may seal. Though sense of his unworthiness he yet may keenly feel. Perhaps we, too, are erring, let us turn our eyes within; Perhaps we'll have no trouble in discovering secret sin. If the question were but answered how our cases stood The echo of the answer would be: no, not one is good. Let us be like Samaritans, and stoop when passing by, To raise a fallen brother and to hear the needy's cry. ETERNITY. Away from earth and its cares set free, The soul in its blissful liberty Shall soar to portals fair and bright, Where sweet-voiced angels clad in white, Are tuning their harps in heavenly glee: We hope to spend Eternity. Over the crystal sea of glass, And through the golden streets we'll pass, Floating along on the placid streams; Or roaming through fields of eternal green, A glorious awakening there will be: When we land on the banks of Eternity. In that beautiful home so far away, There come no nights of dark dismay; The Saviour's love shall round us shine, And light our steps through heavenly clime; And while we join the sweet melody— We'll rest throughout Eternity. With faltering steps here, up and down, With bleeding wounds from sole to crown, We'll cast aside life's troubles here; When, like the Saviour, we appear, Sorrow and tears shall cease to be: In our promised home in Eternity. THE QUARTO CENTENNIAL OF THE BIRTH OF BISHOP RICHARD ALLEN. O, that the Holy Angels would indite Fit words of praise that I might write; Or to my timid, faltering heart reveal Some secret hidden spring, some new found seal, That guards a casket rich and rare and old, Of gems as rich and pure as finest gold O to some unknown depth might I descend, Or, would some fairy spirit its wings me lend, That I might soar aloft and pierce the azure sky— Might penetrate earth's bosom with discerning eye; Or would the touch of heavenly hands inspire My soul, then filled with pure and holy fire, Might wake the cords that now lie dormant here, And catch some rich vibrations from celestial sphere. Year after year is born and glides away, And generations rise and flourish and decay; Flowers bud and blossom, fade and fall, But the eternal truth outlives them all. As in the forest stands the sturdy oak, Where the young ravens scream and groan and croak, Stand like monuments of the unhappy past, Those who have brav'd the summer's heat and winter's blast. On mountain height where hungry eagles slept, In deep ravine where poisonous reptiles crept, Undauntedly the Master's call they heed, And prove themselves his followers indeed. On, on, though often dark and chill the night, In the vineyard gleaning with his cycle bright, In the rank marshes, or whereso'er He led, The sky their only covering, the earth their only bed. O, welcome day, when peace broods o'er the land, Free and untrammeled roams the Christian band; No guillotine is reared, no furious crackling stake; No flames leap high the Christian's life to take. How swift the flight of five and twenty years, Freighted with hope and grief, with joy and tears; To duty came the call that sacred day— Strong in the Master's strength. Paul-like they did obey. But free to tread his own or foreign sod, His voice upraised to the eternal God— No bodies torn asunder fill untimely graves, And o'er the world Salvation's Banner waves. Oh! Allen, you are with us here to-day, Noting these services, this grand array; Those sightless eyes methinks look into mine With holy happiness divine. With gratitude we gather here and now— Our praises render while we meekly bow To heaven, who gave us such a man as thee, And God's own Son, who died to set us free. HEART-HUNGRY. O, Hungry Heart. Contend not with thy fate; Lonely thou art, But yet must hope and wait. For all thy craving, Thou shalt be filled; Why this mad raving? Why so self-willed? Longing, art thou, For that which comes not? Submissive bow, Sad is thy lot, What must the end be? Lest thou relent, Love will consume thee, Thy power be spent. Dost thy cold mate That thou hast chosen Smile at thy fate With glances frozen? O, hungry heart, In shadow groping Still act thy part, And go on hoping? Thy fate invites thee, Kind or unkindly; Thou art not free, Love loves e'er blindly. As thirsty meadow Welcomes the dew, And as the shadow Follows the true. All the emotion Thou dost impart Will find devotion, O, hungry heart, O, hungry heart, It is not in vain Somewhere, somehow! For all thy pain. For all thy sorrow, Thy bitter tears, Happiness borrow From coming years. O, hungry heart, Hope is all beauty, Disappointment's dart Points thee to duty. I WILL LOOK UP. I will look up to Thee With faith's ne'er-failing sight, My trust repose in Thee, Though dark and chill earth's night. I will look up to Thee, Though rough and long the way, Still sure Thou leadest me Unto the perfect day. I will look up to Thee When lone and faint and weak. “My grace sufficeth Thee;” I hear Thy soft voice speak. I will look up to Thee, For if Thou, Lord, art near, Temptations quickly flee, And clouds soon disappear. I will look up to Thee With feeble voice I cry. Lord, pity helpless me— Without Thy aid I die. I will look up to Him Who died my soul to save; Who bore my load of sin— His blood a ransom gave. I will look up to Thee, The all-anointed one, Who opes the gate for me, To the eternal throne. I will look up to Thee; I feel my sins forgiven— Thy footprints, Lord I see, They mark the way to heaven. I will look up to Thee, When doubt and fear arise; Though dangers compass me, Upward I lift mine eyes. I will look up to Thee, Who knoweth all my needs; Thy spirit, Lord, grant me, My soul in anguish pleads. I will look up to Thee! Though all I have below, Thou takest Lord from me, Thou canst the more bestow. I will look up to Thee, Thou bright and morning star; With eyes of faith I see, Thy glory from afar. I will look up to Thee, My hand shall rest in thine; Where e'er thou wilt lead me, Thy will, O Lord, not mine! I will look up to Thee, When death's relentless hand Has laid its weight on me, Save—Thou atoning Lamb! I will look up to Thee, When crossing Jordan's wave; Then, Lord, I look to Thee— Whose power alone can save! HOPE THOU IN GOD. O, soul, why shouldst thou downcast be, Or mourn thy temporal lot; Where'er 'tis cast, what's that to thee— Doth not God choose the spot? Rouse thee, and labor for success! And be thou well assured; The shadows near the end grow less, And pain must be endured. Although I meet with conflicts here, And storms beset my path. Though devils shoot their fiery darts Of disappointed wrath, My feet upon the blood-marked way Shall ever onward press, And looking to the “perfect day,” My faith shall not grow less. What if the ungodly spread a snare, And wicked councils meet— Lord, guard with loving, watchful care, My timid, faltering feet. Soul, thou must daily suppliance make, If thou wouldst well be fed— The righteous He will not forsake, Nor shall his seed beg bread. The cloudy pillar day by day, The fiery cloud by night, Shall mark the straight and narrow path, That leads to lasting light. Where trembling hope receives her sight, Where flowers eternal grow, God's presence beams forever bright, And living waters flow. TO CLEMENTS' FERRY. One lovely summer afternoon when balmy breezes blew, A charming little buggy, scarce large enough for two, Dashed down a narrow little street and stopped beside a gate, Where a charming little lassie dwelt, a lad had met of late. Out stepped a little body, looking like a happy bride; He gently stood and placed her in a safe seat at his side: “I'm going to show you now,” said he (with eyes that twinkle merry). “The very prettiest of drives, it leads to Clements' Ferry.” “If you have never head of it, my darling little treasure, I'll tell you all about the place, it will afford me pleasure.” And on they sped, mile after mile, with chat and laughter merry— He watched her dimpled, roguish smile and drove toward the ferry. Through lovely groves, where birds sang sweet their notes of joy so merry, Or partridge, hid in ripened wheat, whistled his “Bob White” cherry. Up the shell road and o'er the fields and by the moss-hung oaks. Where marshy land its rich grain yields or sad-voiced raven croaks. Then turning off the highway and past the gate of toll, Then up into a by-way which led straight to the knoll, “'Tis here,” said he “the loveliest spot in all the world so wide, Swept by the breezes from the sea, and kissed by every tide. Come down beside the river's brink, where the water ripples merry— A lovely place to rest and think, down here beside the ferry.” So taking his uplifted hands she gave a little bound, And very soon they sat them down upon the grassy ground. “In days that are forever fled, when slavery cursed this nation, This land was owned by “Clements” and on his great plantation Were many slaves who daily tilled this soil, 'tho oft in pain— Their master's coffers must be filled from the fields of golden grain. They knew no rest who labored there, but worked from early light— They ploughed and hood and reaped and sowed, till the sun went down at night; Then to the river they would come all foot-sore, worn and weary, Hungry and faint to reach their home they crossed here at the ferry. One day, they heard a strange sweet voice, not such as wont to lead them; It made their burdened hearts rejoice, for 'twas the voice that freed them. And when the sun went down that night their shouts rose loud and merry— They crossed with footsteps swift and light the last time o'er this ferry. So here beside this river we have found a rustic seat”— And still the water rippled on and winds blew soft and sweet— “I've something else to tell you,” and his laughing eyes were merry, He whispered something in her ear, but not about the ferry. The sun was shining in the west and back toward home they drove; Soft twilight had its shadows cast o'er field and “knoll” and grove— The “ferry has another name, which lovers oft repeat, Instead of ‘Clements' Ferry,’ it is now Sun Set Retreat.” THE BIRTH OF TIME. Happy moments tell me, pray, Where were you on yesterday? While I sit, bowed low with sorrow, Tell me where you'll be to-morrow. Come you from a heavenly clime, Linger with me all the time; Every day will then be bright, Every burden then seem light. Are you slumbering with the flowers, While I have my darkest hours? I am sure it would be pleasant If I found you ever present. Happy moments seemed to say: “I am busy all the day; Every hour I well must fill, So I never can be still. You, my friend, would happier be, If you busy kept like me; Then your joys would seem the sweeter, And your dark hours would seem fleeter. More of joy and less of grief, All your days of labor brief, If the moments you improve, By some little deed of love. All the earth is full of beauty, Where we live and do our duty; Then your sun will seem the brighter, And your heavy heart grow lighter. May I ask you, idle one, To recount the good you've done, To deserve the joys you've tasted— Now account for time you've wasted.” Then I felt a sudden start, And the impulse of my heart Was, that I must work to-day; For the moments haste away. Little moments, will you wait While your wings with prayer I freight; So when I drop out of time, I may see God's smile divine? I could not a moment borrow, For to-day is gone to-morrow; And to-morrow is “to-day,” So the debt I could not pay. Tell me moments: whence your birth, Whence your coming to the earth? Was your birthplace 'mid the flowers, Or in cloudlets, fleece-like bowers? Then the answer quickly came Like a chipped-off lightning flame: “When the great Creator flung Out the world, on nothing hung, Then was I destined to be, ‘Time’ until Eternity.” TENNYSON'S POEMS. On receiving Tennyson's Poems from Mrs. M. H. Dunton, of Brattleboro, Vt. Dear Friend, since you have chosen to associate My humble thoughts with England's poet laureate, I trust that he will bear me pleasant company, And soon we shall far more than mere acquaintance be. Since childhood's days his name I have revered, And more and more it has become to me endeared; I blush not for the truth, I but confess, I very wealthy feel since I his “works” possess. I've found in the immortal Shakespeare much delight, Yet, oft his vulgar language shocked me quite; And I twice grateful am, that I no more shall be Dependent in spare moments on his company, But I shall roam o'er England's proud domain, Shall meet her lords and ladies, and her peasants plain, Attend her royal spreads, and figure at her courts, On prancing steed, with nodding plume, I join their hunting sports. THINE OWN. To live and not to be Thine Own, Like Springtime is when birds are flown; Or liberty in prison bars, Or evening skies without the stars; Like diamonds, that are lusterless, Or rest when there's no weariness; Like lovely flowers that have no scent, Or music when the sound is spent. LOVE LETTERS. Dear Letters, Fond Letters, Must I with you part? You are such a source of joy To my lonely heart. Sweet Letters, Dear Letters, What a tale you tell; O, no power on earth can break This strange, mystic spell! Dear Letters, Fond Letters, You my secret know— Don't you tell it, any one— Let it live and grow. MATIN HYMN. Is this the way, my Father, That Thou wouldst have me go— Sealing the rugged mountain steep, Or through the valley low? Walking alone the path of life, With timid, faltering feet, Fighting with weak and failing heart, Each conflict that I meet? “Nay! nay! my child,” the Father saith, “Thou dost not walk alone— Gird up the loins of thy weak faith, And cease thy plaintive tone. Look thou with unbeclouded eyes To Calvary's gory scene.” Canst thou forget the Saviour's cries? Go thou, His mercy lean. My Father, brighter grows the way, Less toilsome is the road; If Thou Thy countenance display, O, lighter seems my load! And trustingly I struggle on, Not murmuring o'er my task; The mists that gather soon are gone, When in Thy smile I bask. Turn not from me Thy smiling face, Lest I shall surely stray, But in Thy loving arms' embrace, I cannot lose my way. My Father, when my faith is small, And doubting fills my heart, Thy tender mercy I recall, O, let it ne'er depart! I LOVE THEE. Thou art near me, but I see Thine eyes Shine through the gloom like stars in winter skies— Pointing the way my longing steps would go, To come to Thee because I love Thee so. Thou art not near me, but I feel Thine arm, Soft folded round me, shielding me from harm, Guiding me on as in the days of old— Sometimes life seems so dark, so dreary and so cold. Thou art not near me, but I hear Thee speak, Sweet as the breath of June upon my cheek, And as Thou speakest I forget my fears, And all the darkness, and my lonely tears. O love, my love, whatever our fate may be, Close to Thy side, or never more with Thee, Absent or present, near or far apart, Thou hast my love and fillest all my heart. MY CANARY. Little bird with tuneful throat, Happy heart and silvery note— Dainty beak and feathers yellow, Thou art such a charming fellow. Always merry, full of glee, Seeming happy as can be— All the house with music thrilling, And my heart with pleasure filling. Could I sing I'd vie with thee: In sweet strains of melody We would raise our voices high To praise our Maker in the sky. MY MOCKING BIRD. No gorgeous coat has he, He is plain as he can be: Singing all the live-long day, Imitating what I say, Mocking ev'ry bird in bush, Sparrow, wren, or hawk, or thrush, Parrot, robin, finch or crow, Owl, oriole, bird of snow, With a cuteness quite astounding, Bird and man alike confounding. MORN. Fresh and fair the morn awaketh From her couch of down; Parting kiss her lover taketh, Ere his daily journey maketh Of the world around. For a jolly-hearted rover, Ever full of fun, Making calls the wide world over, Flower and leaf, and blade and clover, Welcome him, the sun. Gloom from weary hearts dispelleth, Shedding joy and light O'er the homes where sorrow dwelleth, Of eternal sunshine telleth, And the mansions bright. Evening's gentle voice is pleading, But he will not stay; Her entreaties all unheeding, Morning's tender smile succeeding, Beckons him away. Now while just a halo lingers, Note his roguish smile; With the tip ends of his fingers, Sweet good day he gently flings her, But retreats the while. DO YOU THINK? Do you think, when you plan for to-morrow, That the morrow you may not see, That long ere the dawn of the morrow's morn. You may be in eternity. Do you tread in the foot-steps of Jesus, In the darkness as well as the light? Should the death angel come, to summons you home— Say, would it be glory, or night? MUSIC. O, wondrous depth to which my soul is stirr'd, By some low tone, some softly breathed word— Some thrill or cadence sweet which fills my heart, My inmost powers awake, and thrill and start, My bosom seems too narrow a confine For such a power, dear music, as is thine. O, that my heavy, heavy falt'ring tongue, Could warble forth thy ev'ry prompted song, The world should join the gladsome song I'd raise, And to the King shout lofty notes of praise. E'en when my heart is wrapt in sorrow's night, Mine eyes of clay are clos'd, but heavenly light Doth shine into the desert of my soul, And billows of sweet music o'er me roll. A MOTHER'S LOVE. What sacrifice so great! No hour too early, or too late, No isle too distant, shore or strand, She may not reach with earnest heart, and willing hand. What love so strong! It is her child, or right or wrong, In crowded court of justice, if condemn'd, Her love and tearful eyes doth still defend. What love so pure! Friendship oft is false, but one is sure That mother's love clings to us to the last, Wherever in life our varied lot is cast. MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT. Is thy sun obscured to-day By a cloud of sorrow? It cannot be thus alway, Bright may be the morrow, Hast thou left of hope a spark? Sit not down repining— Never was there cloud so dark, Had not silver lining. Adverse currents strong and swift Sweep across thy soul— Courage, heart, the cloud must rift. It will backward roll. Is thy bark far from the land, On a tempestuous ocean? Stretch to God thy helpless hand, He can stay commotion. Sits thy soul in grief to-day 'Neath the weeping willow? On the Son thy burden lay, Soft will seem thy pillow, Doth amidst thy course arise Difficulty's mountain; Sweetest draught his love supplies From the crimson fountain. Dost thou wander weak and faint Through life's desert lonely? God regards the feeblest plaint, He can aid thee only, Without His all-seeing eye, Not a sparrow falleth; More He heeds the humble cry, That for mercy calleth. Raise to God thy streaming eyes, Contrite heart's petition— Let no waves of doubt arise, For thy sad condition. WHERE DO SCHOOL DAYS END? A little child sat on the floor, Turning the pages o'er and o'er, Of Mother Goose's nursery book; He raised his eyes with puzzled look, And said, “Mamma, attention lend, And tell me: Where do school days end?” My boy, that is no easy task— A weighty question 'tis you ask; For every day adds to our store Of knowledge gained the day before; So you must ask some wiser friend To tell you, where school days will end. The parson came that very day, His usual pastoral call to pay: The child stole in with cunning look, And on a stool his seat he took. Sir, will you information lend, And tell me, where school days will end? The parson with astonished air, Pushed his fingers through his hair: Little child, I am much afraid That I can give but little aid; But my best efforts I will lend, To tell you, where school days will end. There is a land of light you know, Where all good people are to go— Where little children rob'd in white Are ever happy in God's sight. And when you die He'll angels send, To take you where school days shall end. THE BIRTH OF JESUS. Quietly the world lay sleeping, Save on fair Judean plain; Faithful Shepherds watch were keeping, Lest their tender flocks be slain. Silently the snowy mantle O'er the hill and vale was spread— Emblem of seraphic pureness— Carpet fit for angels' tread. Lo, in eastern skies appearing, Backward seems the night to roll; The prophetic star is nearing, Heaven opened as a scroll. Then the heralds gladly singing, Came to announce the Prince of Peace, All the heavenly harps were ringing— Praises chant and never cease. Then a cloud of golden glory Filled the air with heavenly mirth, Angels sang the wondrous story, When the Christ-child came to earth. A HAPPY HEART. Give me a Happy Heart and suasive tongue, That I may cheer the aged and the young; That I may charm the little child, And make the winds of age seem mild. Give me the willing hand and ready feet, To raise the brother lying in the street; Give me the honest heart that has no fear, That with the humble I may shed a tear. Give me the eye of faith that I may see Some good accomplished daily, Lord, for Thee— Give me a heart full of Thy holy zeal. That I my neighbors' joy or woe may feel. Give me the feet that eagerly will run About the Master's work, until the sun Has faded in its glory in the west, And all the busy world has sought its rest. WHEN I WOULD DIE! Not when leaves are brown and sere, Not when days are cold and drear; Not when roses faded die, Not when clouds o'ercast the sky. But when spring-time breezes blow, And make sweet music, soft and low; When birds their happy carols sing, When flowers their lovely odors bring— When woods their richest verdure yield, When lambs frisk in the clover-field; When bee and butterfly fill the air, When morn awaketh bright and fair; When love upon the breeze is born— Oh, I would die on Easter morn! When the morn with lovely grace Greets the world in soft embrace; When the lily's rich perfume Woos the minstrel's harp to tune, And the lark his song of praises To the Great Creator raises. Upward soars in happy mood, Loud his notes of gratitude, For security and rest, For the birdlings in his nest. When the daisies dot the lawn, I would die at Easter dawn! When the year is blithe and young. Happiness on every tongue— After winter's icy chains Lose their hold upon the plains; When the waters, rippling on, Tell the power of winter gone— Spring leads him her willing slave, Then lay me in the quiet grave; Loved ones, do not come and weep, For I shall only be asleep; Roses heap upon the mound, And I shall rest both sweet and sound. Let no heart for me be aching, Christ will see to my awaking. DECEMBER. The skies o'ercast and fierce winds blow Their chilling breath thro' leafless trees, Streams fetter-bound in icy chains, And frosty net-work on the panes. The birds have sought a summer clime, Each tender floweret, bud and vine, Has hid away with timid fear, For lo, December days are here! The blazing legs are heard to crack, And all the grain is garnered now. JUDGE NOT. Perchance the friend who cheered thy early years, Has yielded to the tempter's power; Yet, why shrink back and draw away thy skirt, As though her very touch would do thee hurt? Wilt thou prove stronger in temptation's hour? Perchance the one thou trusted more than life Has broken love's most sacred vow: Yet judge him not—the victor in life's strife, Is he who beareth best the weight of life, And leaveth God to judge, nor questions how. Sing the great song of love to all, and not The wailing anthems of thy woes; So live thy life that thou may'st never feel Afraid to say, as at His throne you kneel, “Forgive me, God, as I forgive my foes!” UNUTTERED PRAYER. My God, sometimes I cannot pray, Nor can I tell why thus I weep; The words my heart has framed I cannot say, Behold me prostrate at Thy feet. Thou understandest all my woe; Thou knows't the craving of my soul— Thine eye beholdeth whereso'er I go; Thou can'st this wounded heart make whole. And oh! while prostrate here I lie, And groan the words I fain would speak: Unworthy though I be, pass not me by, But let thy love in copious showers break. And deluge all my thirsty soul, And lay my proud ambition low; So while time's billows o'er me roll. I shall be washed as white as snow. Thou wilt not quench the smoking flax, Nor wilt Thou break the bruised reed; Like potter's clay, or molten wax, Mould me to suit Thy will indeed. WHOSO GIVES FREELY SHALL FREELY RECEIVE. When Jesus was leaving this sin-accursed land, These words full of comfort he left with his band: “Ye are not forsake, my peace I will leave, And whoso gives freely shall freely receive!” “Your Father in heaven, so righteous and just, Will comfort your hearts, if in Him ye trust; If only on Jesus, his Son, ye believe, Then ye who give freely, shall freely receive!” “On the just and the unjust descendeth the rain— The fields all revived bring abundance of grain; Give honor and glory and firmly believe That whoso gives freely shall freely receive.” Step out from your door on a bleak winter day— Half-clad and half-starving, you meet on your way, Some one who is begging for alms to relieve, Think! whoso gives freely, shall freely receive! Perhaps but a penny dropped into a hat— Yet the angels recording will take note of that, Like the mite of the widow, whatever you give, Much or little—give freely, you'll freely receive! There are often around us dear souls in distress, Who are needing not money, but kind words to bless— Their lives seem so weary—a word will relieve; Let's give to them freely, they'll gladly receive! When finished our course in this vale here below, When Christ shall the robe and the crown bestow On those who were faithful and quick to believe, Who gave him their service shall freely receive! WILBERFORCE. Read at the 25th Anniversary of Wilberforce, Ohio, June, 1887. A quarter century ago, On a March morning, bleak and wild, The joyful news spread to an fro: To Afro-Methodist is born a child; Begotten in the time of strife, And born in adverse circumstance, All trembled for the young child's life, It seemed to have so poor a chance, But, nursed by every tender care, It stronger grew, until at last Our hearts no longer feel a fear, The danger is forever past. The feeble childhood's days are flown, How swiftly speed the years away; We hail thee now a woman grown In regal robes and Queen's array. Thou dark-browed beauty of the west, Thy matchless grace is widely known; Rich jewels sparkle on thy breast, Thy head supports a royal crown. And through thy veins pure Afric's blood Flows fearlessly along its course; Thy cheeks are mantled by the flood; We hail thee, lovely Wilberforce! Thy palace gates are open wide— All are invited to the feast; From frigid North or Southern side, From every point, from West to East. Thou holdest in thine outstretched hand The richest, rarest gifts to youth; From snow-capped peak to ocean strand, Thou offerest all the words of truth. They come! their burning thirst to quench, For wisdom, honor, knowledge, power; From hidden depths rich jewels wrench— Successful effort crowns each hour. But foul incendiary's cruel hand, Thy Territory did invade; By ruthless and destructive brand Thy lovely walls were lowly laid. When night had hushed the birds to sleep, Out of his covert see him creep; The crackling flame and lurid glare Burst out upon the midnight air. And what had seemed so strong and fair, Now lay a mass of ruins there; Triumphantly look'd all our foes, And gloated o'er our many woes. But men of iron nerve and will Looked up to God, with courage still: Believing He their cries would heed, And prove a friend in time of need. The tiny seeds of kindness sown, Into a mighty tree has grown, And youth and maiden side by side Sit 'neath its spreading branches wide. And though the seed be sown in Payne, The trite old saying we maintain: That whoso'er in Payne we sow, By faith's tears watered it shall grow, Our trust untarnished by alloy, We sow in tears but reap in joy: And may thy praises never cease, And all thy paths be those of peace. EASTER MORN. Lo! the glorious dawn is breaking, And the night of gloom is gone, All the earth from slumber waking, Hails with joy the Easter Morn! Lo! the sun's bright rays are peeping Over Calvary's crimson height, Soldier guards who watch were keeping, Saw Him rise in power and might! Mary ran with footsteps fleeter Than the other two who went— Where an angel sat to greet her, And the grave a glory lent. With their spices they were going To the tomb where Jesus lay— Faithful ones, without the knowing, Who should roll the stone away? To the rich man's new sepulchre Mary's eager feet drew near; Lo, she saw the tomb was open, And her heart was filled with fear! At the grave she stooped, and peeping, Angels saw in white arrayed, Where her Lord was lately sleeping, “And the clothes aside were laid!” Back she drew with fear and quaking, But the angel watcher said: “Jesus is among the living, Seek Him not among the dead.” “He is risen, He is risen,” Now dispel thy gloom and fear From the grave's embrace and prison; Rose triumphant, He is not here! Then awake the song of gladness, Let it float upon the air; Joy dispels the gloom and sadness, Past the night of dark despair. Shout with gladdest acclamation, Raise with joy the gladsome sound, And with great acceleration Spread to earth's remotest bound. He is risen! great in glory; Death is vanquished, lost its sting! Vain the grave can boast of victory, He is risen, Christ the King! THE CITY BY THE SEA. Love thee? Yes, I'm sure I love thee, Dear old city by the sea; Love thy grandly towering spires, Love thy matrons and thy sires; Love thy gallant sons so true, Love thy genial skies of blue; Love thy gentle fair-haired daughters; And the music of thy waters Flowing gently all around thee. All are ever dear to me! Hark! I think I hear the echo Of the notes of melody; And the chimes ecstatic pealing From St. Michael's o'er me stealing, Woos me back to pleasant hours Spent among the fragrant flowers; And the ocean's distant roar Burst in music on the shore— And the snowy white-capped waves, Every nook and cranny laves, As they break in sportive glee On the “battery” by the sea! Of thy fame and vanished glory, Dear old city by the sea— All too well I know the story, When thy deeds were dark and gory, But the Inchcape bell's low moaning Echoes not the sad slave's groaning, As from Afric's torrid sands, He was brought in iron bands, Writhing in his agony, To the city by the sea! Through the evening's mellow haze, Dear old city by the sea, What a picture meets my gaze, Relic of departed days! Standing yet the wave-washed Fort, Sumpter. From whose walls the loud report Echoed all around the world— (Now with stars and stripes unfurled) Echoed like a bolt of thunder, Burst the iron bands asunder, Set the slave at liberty, In the city by the sea! O'er thee broods the calm of peace, Dear old city by the sea— “Monitor,” and “Ironsides,” At thy port no longer ride. But I would forget the past, Lest a shadow it should cast O'er my musing sweet of thee, Dear old city by the sea! And I love thee, still I love thee, Ever dear art thou to me! FORGETFULNESS! “Darling,” he said, “I never meant To hurt you.” And his eyes were wet— “I would not hurt you for the world: Am I to blame, if I forget?” “Forgive my selfish tears,” she cried: “Forgive! I knew that it was not Because you meant to hurt me, sweet, I knew it was that you forgot!” But all the same, deep in her heart Rankled this thought, and rankles yet— When love is at its best, one loves So much, that one cannot forget! THE NEW ORGAN. Read at the Dedication of the New Organ at Mt. Zion Church, Charleston, S. C. Thou monstrous gilt and rainbow-tinted thing, With many a thousand-mouthed tuneful throat, Help us God's praises here to-day to sing, With happy hearts we raise our joyful note. What charms thou show'st to our uplifted gaze, Some mystic hand seems now to lend thee power, That fillest us with wonder and with praise, And mute we stand and tremble and adore. Thou seemest almost human in thy tones; Even he who built thee did not understand— Sometimes low, plaintive, then so full of mirth, That thou wert peopled by an angel band. O, tell us in thy strong, yet sweetest strain, That He who died, now liveth evermore; Yea, thunder forth the sweet, ah! sweet refrain, That Christ has left for men ajar the door. And tell, forevermore, “Salvation's free,” And pardon come to whosoever will; Turn quick away from guilt and misery; This pardon comes the hungry soul to fill. And on the very air shall praises float, While cherubim and seraphim shall sing; And earth shall raise her very highest note, While heaven, with loudest note, Alleluias ring! When earth is wrecked and matter all consumed, And all our labor here hath found an end, Our happy souls shall strike harps, heavenly tuned— Our voices with angelic voices blend. So we shall praise Him while He lends us breath, On viol, timbrel, lute, and harp and strings, And when our mortal tongues are still in death, Our praise shall mount on high on music's wings. DECEPTION. Life we find is nevermore What at first we thought; When deceit beclouds it o'er, Sad the change that's wrought. Confidence with drooping heart Sadly takes its flight; Fondest love will sure depart— Day seems dark as night. All the love of tender years Turns to bitter hate; Though repentance comes with tears. It may be “too late”— Though the heart in anguish yearn, Lay in sackloth low; Confidence will not return, Shattered by a blow. Then while you possess it whole, Strive it to retain; Heart of truth and purpose, soul Cannot cause you pain. May the tender power of love Penetrate your life— True as are the stars above, And as free from strife. What a tangled web we weave; What a chain of sorrow! When we practice to deceive, Gloom comes with the morrow. OUT IN THE DESERT. Out in the desert afar, dost thou roam— Out on the waste, bleak and wild; Why dost thou wander so far from thy home? Wolves will o'ertake thee, dear child. Jesus stands pleading, With wounds afresh bleeding; O, come to his arms, meek and mild! Out on the mountain so bare and so cold, Hunger will blast thy fair cheek: Jesus, the shepherd, has left the dear fold, Now for thee lost one to seek. Eventide falleth, His tender voice calleth— Hear the sweet tones low and meek! Wander no longer across the wild moor; Back to the fold quickly flee! Jesus has kindly left open the door— Open, O, wanderer for thee! The light is still burning, He waits thy returning— O, prodigal, wander no more! THE BLACK SAMPSON. There's a Sampson, lying, sleeping in the land, He shall soon awake, and with avenging hand, In an unlooked for hour, He will rise in mighty power; What dastard can his righteous rage withstand? E'er since the chains were riven at a stroke, E'er since the dawn of Freedom's morning broke. He has groaned, but scarcely uttered, While his patient tongue ne'er muttered, Though in agony he bore the galling yoke. O, what cruelty and torture has he felt? Could his tears, the heart of his oppressor melt? In his gore they bathed their hands, Organized and lawless bands— And the innocent was left in blood to welt. The mighty God of Nations doth not sleep, His piercing eye its faithful watch doth keep, And well nigh His mercy's spent, To the ungodly lent: “They have sowed the wind, the whirlwind they shall reap.” From His nostrils issues now the angry smoke, And asunder bursts the all-oppressive yoke; When the prejudicial heel Shall be lifted, we shall feel, That the hellish spell surrounding us is broke. The mills are grinding slowly, slowly on, And till the very chaff itself is gone, Our cries for justice louder, 'Till oppression's ground to powder— God speed the day of retribution on! Fair Columbia's filmy garments all are stained; In her courts is blinded justice rudely chained; The black Sampson is awaking, And his fetters fiercely breaking; By his mighty arm his rights shall be obtained! “THEY ARE COMING.” They are coming, coming slowly— They are coming, surely, surely— In each avenue you hear the steady tread. From the depths of foul oppression. Comes a swarthy-hued procession, And victory perches on their banners' head. They are coming, coming slowly— They are coming; yes, the lowly, No longer writhing in their servile bands. From the rice fields and plantation Comes a factor of the nation, And threateningly, like Banquo's ghost, it stands They are coming, coming proudly— They are crying, crying loudly: O, for justice from the rulers of the land! And that justice will be given, For the mighty God of heaven Holds the balances of power in his hand. Prayers have risen, risen, risen, From the cotton fields and prison; Though the overseer stood with lash in hand, Groaned the overburdened heart; Not a tear-drop dared to start— But the Slaves' petition reach'd the glory-land. They are coming, they are coming, From away in tangled swamp, Where the slimy reptile hid its poisonous head; Through the long night and the day, They have heard the bloodhounds' bey, While the morass furnished them an humble bed. They are coming, rising, rising, And their progress is surprising, By their brawny muscles earning daily bread; Though their wages be a pittance, Still each week a small remittance, Builds a shelter for the weary toiling head. They are coming, they are coming— Listen! You will near the humming Of the thousands that are falling into line: There are Doctors, Lawyers, Preachers; There are Sculptors, Poets, Teachers— Men and women, who with honor yet shall shine. They are coming, coming boldly, Though the Nation greets them coldly; They are coming from the hillside and the plain. With their scars they tell the story Of the canebrakes wet and gory, Where their brothers' bones lie bleaching with the slain. They are coming, coming singing, Their Thanksgiving hymn is ringing, For the clouds are slowly breaking now away, And there comes a brighter dawning— It is liberty's fair morning, They are coming surely, coming, clear the way. Yes, they come, their stepping's steady, And their power is felt already— God has heard the lowly cry of the oppressed; And beneath his mighty frown, Every wrong shall crumble down, When the right shall triumph and the world be blest! RT. REV. RICHARD ALLEN. Our Richard Allen in his early youth Sought out and found the way of light and truth; His heart with holy impulses was stirred. And boldly forth he went to preach the word. Sometimes he had not even a resting-place— Footsore and weary, still he cried “free grace”; And yet in pastures green the shepherd fed, And by the cooling stream was often led. Year after year is born and glides away; Generations rise and flourish and decay; Flowers bud and blossom, fade and fall, But eternal truth outlives them all. And so a hundred years have passed away Since the immortal Allen's natal day; And where he sleeps the sun's departing ray Long lingers o'er that hallowed heap of clay. He came of humble parentage to earth; A slave was he of meek and lowly birth; A bondsman, dared not even raise his voice, Nor o'er his young, his darling child rejoice. But God his promises has ever kept, And the foul stigma from this land is swept— At last the slavish chains forever broke. And falls at last the bondman's galling yoke. As they march on you hear their steady tread, With Allen's banner waving overhead; The cause of Christ to distant islands borne Shall flourish till the resurrection morn! HE HATH NEED OF REST! Why stand aghast, This weeping, wondering throng? The warrior hath his armor bright lain down, And now in rapturous song his Master's praise he sings, While angels sweep their harps of thousands' strings, The strains prolong: His fight is over! He hath need of rest. His weary bleeding feet, That trod the field with ever patient tread, The dewy banks have pressed. They tread the streets of gold, His eyes the Saviour's face and smile behold. Say not that he is dead, but He hath need of rest! A goodly fight; A glorious victory won! At Jesus' feet the trophies are laid down, And on the warrior's brow is placed the crown For which he bravely, boldly fought, And heaven's glorious plaudits sought. Now, with the ransomed blest His soul finds rest! Weep ye no more, Nor stand with bated breath; Christ will his promise to the faithful keep, The mighty warrior is but fallen asleep. He feels no more earth's care and toil and pain, Our loss is but his everlasting gain. Arrayed in white, in realms of perfect bliss, He finds a needed rest. Eternal joys are his, Who to the end proves true: Ye fellow-warriors in the gospel field! Fight on, nor dare the battle yield; Press hard the conflict to the gate, Walk in the narrow path and straight; Your upward way from morn to even' press, At last ye too shall find Eternal rest! REV. ANDREW BROWN, OVER THE HILL TO REST. The fight was at its hottest, The battle 'gainst the wrong; The valiant in the contest, Both vigorous and strong. Engaged in deadly conflict, A solid phalanx stood, A breastworks made of soldiers, Even soldiers unto God. Amidst the clang of armor, And crash of cannon's roar, There came a sound which echoed, And spread from shore to shore. Andrew Brown has fallen, No confiscate was he; A captain bold and fearless— No thought but victory. He's just received promotion, To the army in the sky; He's reached a higher station, We shall join him by and by. Then, comrades, do not mourn him, Drive sorrow from your breast, Our loss is his eternal gain, He's o'er the hill at rest. BISHOP JAMES A. SHORTER. Lines Suggested by the Death of our Beloved Bishop, James A. Shorter, who died July 1, 1887. It came upon the noontide air, Like thunder-bolt from clearest skies; Stout hearts were clad in sore despair, And floods of tears flowed from all eyes. Across the States and o'er the plain, And to the distant Isles it sped; From mountain height to sea's domain, Flashed the sad message, “Shorter's dead!” From lip to lip the sad news ran, From every breast arose a sigh; Awestricken stood the stoutest man, Till hope bade all look up on high. God still is just, allwise is He— What He hath taken He can send; Bow down in meek humility And own Him! Trust Him to the end! Our Shorter dies—do we say dead? Nay, only sleeps to wake again! Though earth affords an humble bed, With Kings and Princes he shall reign! He slept not at his duty's post, Who was a mighty army's head— He led an ever conquering host— He sleeps—say not that he is dead! Heaven stood in need of saint to fill Some holy office on that day; And angels, at their sovereign's will, Quickly to earth they sped away. They sought one pure and true and good; They found in Shorter what they sought; Pure in his life and love he stood, And to our sire this message brought: Thy God to-day hath need of thee, They whispered gently in his ear; He looked the shining ones to see, And smiled while they were hovering near. His ever-ready sword in hand, Directed e'er towards evil's breast, Now laid he down at God's command, And entered into peaceful rest. The startled millions paused in pain, Tempted to ask the reason why Their noble captain should be slain? Then out of heaven came this cry: “White is the harvest on the plain, And ripe this shock of wheat has grown: Ye angels reap this perfect grain, Which I with mine own hand hath sown.” A MESSAGE TO A LOVED ONE DEAD. To Bishop James A. Shorter. I send a message, my worthy Chief, For I cannot come to thee now. Though my heart is o'erwhelmed with its weight of grief, At God's stern decree I must bow. They tell me that thou hast fallen asleep, That thou didst discharge thy whole duty; They say it is folly to sit here and weep, For thy life was complete in its beauty. And purity crowned thy declining years, And holiness circled thy head— 'Tis folly they say to sit down here in tears, And grieve o'er the tomb of the dead. I hear the solft tones of Thy fatherly voice, Saying: “Cling to the cross, my dear child,” If after life's labors your soul would rejoice, In the sunshine of God's presence mild. No more shall Thy soft voice fall sweet on my ear, No more in this life shall we meet— Till Christ in His heavenly Kingdom appear, And our warfare on earth is complete. So I send thee this message to-night when I pray, I'll give it the angels for thee— They'll hasten to take it, they will not delay, To bear it to heaven for me. I would not arouse thee, I would not awake, From this thy merited rest; Sleep soundly, thou loved one, thy comfort now take. Upon thy Redeemer's breast! BEREFT. I from my window looked at early dawning, The sweet breeze stirred and kissed my face; O glad is every heart, I thought on this fair morning, Earth seemed so restful in the morn's embrace. In grateful attitude I stood imploring, Sufficient strength for daily care, My heart was pained at sight of badge of mourning, That from my neighbor's door swayed on the air. It told me the “unbidden guest” had entered, And claimed the darling of that fold, In whom their blasted hopes had once been centered, Life evermore within that home was drear and cold. I sought the mother in affliction's hour, My solace offered in her sore distress; I pointed to the Christ, the only power, To cheer the heart bereft and comfortless. And in my heart's great deep I pitied her, Who, though bereft, could sympathetic be; Our mutual tears were shed—I childless was— And in her inmost soul she pitied me! RESTING. In Memoriam of Mrs. Eliza Ann Turner, wife of Bishop Turner. We mourn to-day o'er our sister dead, But sweet seemed the rest to the weary head, The hands were calmly laid to rest O'er the pulseless bosom and painless breast, The lips are silent and closely sealed, The love of the Saviour, her smile revealed; The weary feet that so often trod Rough ways that led to the throne of God, They tire no more, but forever are still; They've reached the summit of Zion's hill! Thrice had she come to the river before— The boatman tarried to take her o'er, But the voice of loved ones raised in prayer, Prevailed with the Master her life to spare; Then through life's day she gladly gleaned, For the dear Saviour on whom she leaned— A cup of cold water, or binding a wound, Samaritan-like she was always found. Her labors are ended, her trials are o'er, Her soul has flown to the golden shore, Where saints are rejoicing in white robes dressed, And star-decked crowns on their brows are pressed. Yes, she has passed on to the glory-land, And bearing the sheaves she has gleaned in her hand; The conflict is ended, her victory complete, She cast her crown now at the Lord Christ's feet. IN MEMORY OF JAMES M. RATHEL. Came a stranger late among us, With us came and cast his lot; In the Master's vineyard toiling, In God's service chose a spot, Though upon his features ruddy There was yet the smile of youth, In his manly bearing steady, Deep impressed the light of Truth. He had come to lands far distant, And with strangers made his home, But his feet from path of duty Never once was known to roam. Firm of purpose, pleasing manner, Touched with fire from above. Holding up the blood-stained banner, Zealous, full of Christian love. Like the Master daily went he Here and thither doing good In the haunts of vice and mis'ry, On “the solid Rock” he stood. Young, but in the battle leading Older souls who faint had grown; With the youthful daily pleading That the Saviour they should own. Soon, alas, his work was ended, By the monster stricken down, Yet on Christ his hopes depended, And by faith he saw his crown. In his dying gained the victory O'er the grave, and hell, and death; For his voice was raised in praises, Even with his latest breath. Gazing on our fallen brother, Gazing not with tearless eyes, Ah! we thought of his fond mother, Could she in our midst arise, See how loving hands and tender, Wrought the wreaths of lilies fair, Stranger hearts groaning with anguish, Stranger eyes wept many a tear. Though her heart is sad, but sadder, For we know it might have been, Had her boy in shame had fallen, In iniquity and sin, But the congregation passing Slowly by a look to gain For the last knew that before them Lay a Christian free from pain. Pain of earth, and care, and sorrow, From the tempter's snare set free. Rest thou! In the bright to-morrow We shall meet in heaven with thee! Fare thee well and fare thee sweetly, With the saints in glad array, Time moves on, and bears us fleetly Towards the Resurrection Day! THE NATIONAL CEMETERY, BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA. I stand to-day on this historic ground, Where many thousand heroes now at rest Lay in this sea-girt nook, while not a sound Of life or drum disturbs each pulseless breast. But in the earth's embrace they calmly sleep, While peace o'er trees and verdant shrubbery waves, God's white-robed sentinels doth keep Their nightly vigil o'er their grassy graves. And here they lie as in their ranks they stood Upon the field of carnage, where they fell; With noble purpose linked in brotherhood, They broke the bondsman's fetters born of hell. I read the names engraven here on stone, Yet some “unknown” appear who fought for right; But on the records kept on high, not one “Unknown” is found. They're known there in God's sight. “Requiescat in pace” till the bugle call, Shall summon ye with us to meet our God, “Who taketh note of every sparrow's fall, And chasteneth whom He loveth with the rod.” SOLACE. To Minister and Mrs. Lincoln, on the death of their son, A. Lincoln. As o'er thy loved one now in grief ye bendeth, A Nation bows with thee, its sorrow lendeth, That ye, grief-stricken, shouldst not weep alone, Above the shrouded form of thy dear one. But as we shed with thee our silent tears, For him who bore himself beyond his years, Hope bids us cease and banisheth our pain, And pleads your loss, his soul's eternal gain. The reaper cuts the grain and lovely flowers, Transplants them in a fairer land than ours, The path to heaven rendered thus more plain, Weep not, press on, ye all shall meet again. He nobly lived nor feared the shad'wy vale, Defied the white horse with its rider pale; The grave no terror hath, and death no sting, For him who fully trusts in Christ the King. AN EPITAPH. When I am gone, Above me raise no lofty stone Perfect in human handicraft, No upward pointing gleaming shaft. Say this of me, and I shall be content, That in the Master's work my life was spent; Say not that I was either great or good, But Mary-like, “She hath done what she could.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART SECOND. LATER POEMS, Sacred and Sentimental. THE DESERTED WIFE. Turn not away thy face, Nor look upon me with averted gaze; Canst thou not in me trace Thy friend of former days? Thou lookest yet with scorn On me as if I were thy very foe. Oh! once shone bright for me love's morn, Now naught is mine but woe. What wrought the change, Into my earthly eden came? A ruthless hand which did estrange, And quenched love's flame. And deftly as the thread By moths destroyed, or flowers heart, When gnawed by worm, lies dead, Then came the end love's fabric fell apart. Nay, 'twas not I who forged the chain Which clanks and fetters me to-day; Nay, but with failing power I sought in vain Fate's cruel hand to stay. My love was reverence, For him my senior by some years, His growing coldness took for reticence, And drowned my grief in tears. I was too confident, His love to doubt I cherished as a boon, As soon would I have charged the stars above Inconstant to the moon. No service was too great Or low for me, so I could win His smiles approval I could be Happy alone in him. My patient watch was vain, The tempter sowed a fructifying seed, It grew and ripened and its fruits was pain, My life was woe indeed. But I seek no redress, Though he may claim inconstancy was mine, I loved so blindly and I this confess, 'Twas him I loved and love my greatest crime. “THE WOUNDED HEART.” Through the long night and weary day, A lover sat and thus did meditate, His burdened soul poured forth a plaintive lay, With tearful eyes he wept o'er his unhappy state, To God he lifts his trembling voice and cries, Had'st thou seen fit upon me to bestow, The poet's gift of verse, or thought it wise, That I to others might make known my woe. Dear God, methinks I'd have the power to wake The immortal Shakespeare who would seize his pen, And Cullen Bryant a defence would make, To more securely hold his place with men. The silent air is ladened with my grief, It seems to wait in pity on my prayer; O God, Thou who alone can'st send relief, Desert me not to vain hope and despair. Ah, is the idol gone which I adore, Forced from my side by a relentless fate; Her bright smile gone, fled from me evermore, Which e'er was wont my grief to disipate? As like a cruel wolf would snatch away The tender lamb from bleating mother's side, Disconsolate and lone I wait to-day, And mourn my life's sole star, my love, my pride. Strong hope and love doth yet contend, Though crushed and bleeding still upon the field, Dost heaven bear witness, yet no mercy lend? To cruel fate must hope and love then yield? And will the future in its bright beyond, For recompense no nuptial bonds bestow, Nor grant my dearest wish so true, so fond, For this extreme of woe? Ah, sweet day of the past that made us one, That passed so like a pleasant dream; My joys are fled as vessels that have gone A wreck on time's tempestuous stream. I only ask this little question why, When fate his cruel, cruel work begun; Did not let death's ne'er-failing arrow fly And smite me then his work were done. THE WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. Swift the years have sped away Since that bright mid-winter day, Tremblingly in woman's pride, I became thy happy bride. Sped until they number nine, Since my hand lay calm in thine; Plighted there our mutual vow, That together “I and thou.” In God's sight “till death should part,” Hand in hand and heart to heart, While He granted to us life, Thence should live as “man and wife.” Orange blossoms crisp and fair, Deftly crowned my raven hair; Through the veil I could not see What the future held for me. Confident thy love was mine, Cast my future lot with thine, Judging thee of men the best, Choose thee, yielding all the rest. In the rapid flight of years, Mingled both with joy and tears, Thus the years have passed away, Like a fleeting April day. Sometime sunshine, sometime rain, Sometime joy and sometime pain, No grave shadow or regret, Hath our skies beclouded yet. Could we lift the veil and see What our future lives shall be; Whether life be short or long, Sorrow's wail, or pleasure's song, Nay, while years shall onward sweep, God his watch shall o'er us keep, He our “Mizpah” e'er shall be, Watching close 'twixt thee and me. So together thou and I, As the years go sweeping by, Calmly drifting with the tide, Down life's stream will smoothly glide, May the bliss of sweet content, Rest with us till life is spent; If I leave thee I will wait For thee at the golden gate. If my days outnumber thine, By the will of power Divine, Keep thou watch till I have come, Safely to our heavenly home, Where united we shall be, Happy through Eternity. WOULD YOU REGRET? Would you regret If I within my shroud With calm closed eyes lay dead. My voice forever still In death's embrace so chill, The words you've said Would you regret That we had met? Would you regret, As with the busy throng, You pressed your way along, You never more should see, Or win a smile from me, Would you regret That we had met? Would you regret, As o'er my form you bent, And sought one more embrace, Ere yet the coffin lid, Forever more had hid From you my face; Would you regret That we had met? Would you regret If I no more should stand, Thy clasped hand in mine, The while your sheltering arm, Safe shielded me from harm; Would you regret That we had met? Would you regret, If to the silent tomb, Strong arms should bear me hence; Ah, would you ever miss My warm impassioned kiss? Would you regret That we had met? Would you regret That you had weary been, With my short-comings often tried, Because forsooth one day I claimed to have my way; Your will defied, Would you regret That we had met? Would calm regret Persuade you to the spot Where I be lowly laid; Would you bend low and shed a tear, Above me calmly sleeping there; The words you've said, Would you regret, Alas, that we had met? TRUSTING THEE. My Trust is in God. Lord, on thy promise I rely, That thou wilt hear a sinner's cry, In every trying time of need, And show thyself a friend indeed. Lo, at thy feet I humbly fall, And for thy mercy great I call; O turn to me thy smiling face, Send me abundance of thy grace. Condemned by thy most sacred law, Which broken is each breath I draw; Lord only on thy grace I lean, Which can the guilty soul make clean. To count thy mercies I begin, When lo, a voice comes from within, Where shall the countless blessings end, Which Thou to me doth daily send. When I would closely follow thee, Evil doth present walk with me, And trials sore my way beset, And doubtings in my heart beget. Still I will fully trust in Thee, Who sacrificed thy Son for me, Who paid the debt on Calvary, Atoning Lamb to set me free. WHERE HAST THOU GLEANED? The day now draweth to its close, How has the time been spent? The weary laborer homeward goes, With a heart of love that overflows For loved ones around his hearth that glows, And he is well content. Ask of thyself, what thou hast done Since the morning's sun arose? Hast thou answered the cry of a soul in need, Bound up a heart whose wounds did bleed, To the bed of affliction gone with speed? Then welcome sweet repose. Thrice blest are those who can truly say, As a backward glance they take, That throughout the day which now is spent, Their lips, and hand, and feet were lent, To the bed of affliction gone with speed? All for the Master's sake. And may no shade thy presence hide While I pass Jordan's vale. Be thou my shining light through life, When skies are overcast, Then I shall triumph in the strife, And rest with Thee at last. THE STRICKEN DEER. Where grew the tangled brush, And where the grey moss hung, In long festoons upon the sturdy oak, Where sweetly sang the happy birds, The verdant leaves among, And where the meadow flower-strewn, Its fragrance heavenward sent, There grazed in blissful solitude A herd in sweet content. Where nature's emerald carpet spread Unto the margin of the silvery brook, Whose tranquil flow o'er shining stones, Made music as its tortuous course it took, And sought the heaving bosom of the deep Blue sea, and in and out the timid Dormouse crept. And from the topmost bough, The cunning squirrel chased its happy mate, The stately leader here his unsuspecting Comrades led. The gentle doe with graceful poised head, Besported gay and fearless by his side, Their nimble feet above the green turf sped, They gamboled freely o'er the meadow wide, But in the very zenith of their bliss, A sound disturbs the calmness of the scene, 'Tis not the venomed serpent's warning hiss, The huntsman's aim with crimson dies the green. And now the startled herd with head erect, Do swiftly fly, as like a rushing wind, Their footsteps rendered fleeter by their fear, In eagerness to escape the danger near, Have fled and left the wounded one behind, Beneath the scorching sun's relentless ray, With parched protruding tongue he wounded lay, With gentle eyes upturned that mutely plead, For succor, but the multitude had fled. I LOVE THEE YET. Though change has passed upon thy heart for me And all thy love for me is gone, Believe me, I will love thee still, As fond as I have ever done. Though weeks and months have passed away Since I thy look of coldness met, And though we parted coldly then, I love and prize thee fondly yet. I never thought, I never dreamed That time could change such love as thine, How weak was I to weigh another's Vows and truth and love with mine. I look upon the sunny hours I spent with thee, and no regret Comes o'er my spirit, for my heart Still loves thee deeply, fondly yet. INDIFFERENCE. He comes and goes with quiet step and injured mein, His smile is throttled by that inner thought of wrong conceived, Which, like an iron wedge, has forced itself our lives between, And feigning virtue he is in himself deceived. I meet him with a kiss both true and warm. As never woman granted to her lover; He claims it a disguise of truth and thin, That he can well discover My great mistrust of him. Why is it thus? since I am his my body and the current through it flowing, The breath I breathe, my very thoughts desirous of his welfare knowing, The holy duty of a wife, Ah! this is more Than mere suggestion, am I a wife? 'Tis hereon hangs the all-important question. He careful is that I am amply fed, And warmly clad and have a cozy bed, But recks not many lonely hours I keep Sad watch and vainly summons sleep To weary eyelids fringed with silent tears, Spring forth amid an aching heart's recess, That seeks within his own its happiness. Why should we grow apart? instead of entertwining, Our very lives, our aims, our days, so rapidly declining, We wedded are, nay, I may only say That we were married such and such a day. For wedded only they whose lives and loves are joined, Whose hopes and fears, whose joys and sorrows one, Whose aims like many tributaries run. To make life's river a complete and tranquil whole. Should wifely sphere be sternly circumscribed, And frigid mien calmly institute domestic monarchy, Should lordly husband say, like King Canute, Back! I command, no nearer dare approach, And like a forbidden pasture hedge himself around, With threatened penalties, “tread not upon this ground.” Man's sphere is limitless, the world is his domain, Accept what he can spare, And think not to complain, But what to me the trophies of the world laid at my feet, If I am fainting for affection's favor sweet? THE LADDER OF LIFE. Some rise by easy stages, And some by a harder way, Some lose to-morrow two to one, The progress made to-day. Some reach fame's giddy summit, And gladly around they gaze On the beautiful sight, forgetting The mass at the mountain's base. Some view the heights above them, And though they no courage lack, Their efforts are retarded By their constantly looking back. Some aim to reach the apex By one spasmodic bound, But sadder and wiser the pitiful wrecks, When their great mistake they have found. Some aim to ascend by another's deeds, And will pilfer another's plan, But the method miscarries, he finds that he needs The ambition and heart of a man. MASTER, STILL THE TEMPEST. Master, still the tempest On life's troubled sea, Lest the raging billows Shall overwhelm me. I, a storm-tossed mariner, No safe port can find, From the wild waves beating, And the howling wind. Master, still the tempest, Hear my earnest cry, Fierce the storm clouds gather, And o'erspreads the sky. Lest thou still the tempest, Wrecked my bark shall be, Master, still the tempest, Quiet it, Lord, for me. RESIGNATION. I leave all in thy hands, my God, This last great tidal wave, From life's high rolling sea, If thou be with thy child I need not fear, The billows' fearful wrath Shall not overwhelm that threaten me, 'Tis not that thou forsakest, And doth leave me to an awful destiny, But 'tis thine own wise way of chastening me. LORD I WOULD LOVE THEE. Lord, I would love Thee, Love and obey, Lord, I would serve Thee Day after day. Lord, I would praise Thee With heart and voice, And in thy presence Would I rejoice. Lord, I extol Thee Thou mighty one, For thy great mercies, And for thy son. Lord, draw me nearer, Nearer to Thee, Make my way clearer, That I may see. TEARS. Tears, salt tears, fit emblem of my grief, Tears, crystal tears, that bring me sweet relief; I will not question why my life with sorrow great is swept, Or dare I raise a plea, when Jesus wept. GONE. Amid the surging throng one face I sought, But found it not. So dear to me its smile had seemed, So strong the arm on which I'd leaned, The pure warm heart, the tender kiss, The low sweet voice I sadly miss, My eager search but fed my pain, I sought, but sought in vain. THE BLACK ELM. Beneath the black Elm's verdant shade, That girds the hill and dell and glade, In sweet September days we strayed, A country lass and I. Where golden rod and bird and bee, Were in their rustic beauty free, We cut our names upon a tree, My country love and I. The crystal brooklet glides along. With gentle flow and mirthful song, And silver pebbled sands among, It's waters sparkling glow. The daisies nod their pretty heads, The oak leaves amber are and red, The blue bells spent, lie prone and dead, Upon the dying grass. Sweet September's golden day, Feign would departing summer stay, But fleeting moments haste away, And thou must follow on. TO BISHOP H. TURNER, D. D., LL. D. On his return from his first visit to Africa, 1892. Hail, wanderer; but late returned from Africa's arid sand. A hearty welcome home to this, thine own and native land, Tell us, who dwell within the Gospel's radiant light, Of hapless Africa. What of the distant night? Didst see along the dark horizon, feintest streaks of gray? Then, faithful sage, take courage, 'tis a sign of coming day, Of freedom and of knowledge with an effulgent light. What tidings bringest thou, oh, watchman, tell us of the night. Did Neptune's waves more fiercly beat upon that distant shore? Didst find a race of being than the Saxons any lower, 'Tis proud America's demand, is there a ray of hope, What mayest Columbia expect from the heathen Ethiope? The future queen of earth didst thou not see in Afric's land, With gem bestudded crown and golden sceptre in her hand? Though sable-hued the brow it bore, yet full of royal grace, Bespeaking a direct descent from a proud ancestral race? Did righteous pride thy great heart swell when thou at length did stand, With wonder-opening eyes and viewed thy great ancestors' land, Though naught but vanished glory met thine astonished gaze, The domes of crumbling palaces, their spires still skyward raise. No selfish thought was that which bade thee from thy home away, A mandate from the heavenly King, thy duty was to obey, And to the fiery blasts that over Africa's desert sweep, Thou baredst thy bosom, and didst brave the terrors of the deep. The rank and tangled jungle-weeds and deadly serpent's breath, No terror had for thee, thou hadst no thought or fear of death, But filled with impulse holy, with one absorbing thought, That God's almighty works should in that heathen land be wrought. FRIENDSHIP. I count not him my friend Who ever deigns to praise My face's fairness and the witching Sweetness of my ways. But him who dares to tell In honest voice and strong, That often times my way is right, Oftimes that “I am wrong.” That looks upon my error with a human eye, And if I fail, success's goal to win, Can sympathize with my defeat, And share my sorrow keen. Who, though I feign would be all truth, I human am, and prone to error, Observes my weakness, still hath hope, And flees me not in terror. Whose honest heart and manly purpose towers, Above his fellow men content with small attain, Who bids me skyward to direct my powers, My object and my aim. VIRTUE. There's no return to virtue's state, Save through contrition's open gate. LOVE. Drink deep of love's concoction, It is a draught divine. IMPOSSIBILITIES. Canst teach the heart purity When it has learned deceit? Canst thou restore the faded flower, It's vanished odor sweet? Canst yoke the fleeting moments, Or make them to return? Canst thou renew the fire With the fuel which was burned? TRUISMS. Beware of the man who listens much and talks little: he is getting your thunder and saving his lightning. Anon. Truth can travel to the end of the earth alone, but a lie must have company to keep up its courage. Anon. TO MRS. BISHOP LEE. Prior to the birth of her little daughter. O, Mary, bearing blessed virgin's name. Who gave the world its Christ through whom salvation came; Hast aught of fear or doubt awoke in thee A dread? Fear not, God guards thee tenderly. Dost thou regard the promise of his word, With which his love so perfectly doth blend, Fear not the crisis, all thy prayers are heard; He'll not forsake, so trust him to the end. Thou dwellest in the sunshine of his smile, And of the many women thou art blest. His goodness dwelleth with thee all the while, So confident abide and be at rest. Blessed is she who bears the mother's pain In the fulfillment of the first command. Though thou art frail, His arm will thee sustain, And safe support thee to the blessed end. GRAYSTONE CREST, LOGAN STATION, PHILADELPHIA, PA. 'Tis Sabbath, and a lovely calm O'erspreads the fields of many tints of green, The falling blossoms from the budding trees Lie white upon the tender blades of grass, The air is freighted with their odor sweet, And fans our heated faces as we pass. And naught disturbs the quiet of the hour, Except the distant echo of the train, That through the valley swept with din and roar, And darted into view, then out again. Across the track and in the near beyond, The browsing cattle graze upon the hill, While goslings glide upon the bosom of a pond, Whose waters ripple by the sporting wind at will. The mating birds with music fill the wood, With glad anticipations sweetly sing, An anxious mother hen collects her brood Contentedly beneath her open wing. And yonder is the “City of the dead,” O'er which the weeping willow gently waves, Beneath the sod there loved ones low are laid, And gentle hands plant flowers on their graves. O, happy here might I forever dwell, Surrounded by this calm and sweet repose, No ache or sorrow should my bosom swell, Until my day of life had reached its close. What if the world in blindness me should chide, For all my failings in this blest retreat, With one sincere who would in me confide, This realm enough, my joy would be complete. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT DAY WILL BE OUR LAST. Let us treasure our friends, For our wrongs make amends, And sincerely repent of the past, Through the world as we move, Let our deeds be full of love, For we never know what day will be our last. There are faces filled with woe, That we meet as we go, With their heart's inmost sorrow o'ercast. For to-morrow do not wait, Lest our aid should be too late, And we never know what day will be our last. Do what'er we find to do, With a heart sincere and true, For we'll not return the way to-day we pass; We are pilgrims on life's road, Let us share each other's load, For we never know what day will be our last. If you do not roll in wealth, Still possess a share of health, Let no shadow o'er your countenance be cast. Do not idly sit and fret, Banish worry and regret, For the day we call to-day may be our last. TIME'S FLIGHT. Time moves on leaden wings, When we would have it swift, To reach our heart's desires, And music dolorously sings, While still our hopes aspire. Time walks with tardy feet, When all our yearnings crave, Once more a sight of faces sweet, Within the silent grave. Time drags its length along, Each slowly passing day, When hushed and still the song, Which once made glad our way. Time never seemed to fly, Until on painful couch, Our loved ones prostrate lie, Unconscious of our touch. MOVING. Old Home, I'm leaving thee to-day, our sweet relations end; 'Tis not without a pang I grant, I part with thee, old friend, Thou hast been very dear to me, a friend for many years; Companion mute wert thou who shared my happiness and fears, I cherish every blade that bent beneath my slippered feet, Each flowret fair that blossomed here diffusing odors sweet; I learned within thy friendly walls how true to love a mate, I learned, alas, I learned also true love can turn to hate. How closely round the heart could love its clinging tendrills weave, How cruelly a selfish heart could flatter and deceive. But thou hast been, dear home, a friend that ever shared with me An equal portion of my lot, whate'er that lot might be; Thou saw'st me happy, when a tiny babe lay on my breast, Thou wepst with me when mother passed unto her final rest, Or when my friends with merry hearts to share my pleasure came, Thy walls with gladness did resound and echo back the same, So I must leave you, dear old friend, although I love you so; 'Tis said “the best of friends must part,” though loath I yet must go; Though we may never meet again, as in the happy past, I'll cherish happy thoughts of you, old home, while life shall last. TO MY FRIEND. He said he was my friend, both faithful, tried and true; If I could not believe, he would submit to any test; That my exacting will might choose to put him to, And yet, while all the air is rife with critics' tongue, He seeks me not, although my weary heart with pain is wrung, But must I yield to gathering doubts that rise, And chide him for his coming, long delayed? No, I can see the flash that lit his honest eyes, When, with his swelling heart, he my poor friendship prayed. The silver moon in cloudless sky shone clear Above the leafless tree tops gray and bare, A tiny brooklet rippled on its pebbly way, It's music strange fell swiftly on my ear; My hand with arduous grasp he took and swore That evermore my cause he would defend, And I in confidence might dwell secure. In him I had a staunch and faithful friend; What beauty did surround the quiet scene? There crumbling into dust the old gray mill, It's service done, it stands with tranquil mien, A picture of the past, upon the little hill, Its massive cogwheels running to decay, O'er which the struggling water dashed along, And hastened rushing forward on its way, To join the greater current of the creek beyond. The oaks are stiff and gnarled and gray and bare, They skyward stretch their knotted waving boughs, Through which the winds sing a discordant air, As those bereft sing of their heart-felt woes; But beauty gilds the scene and 'tis not drear, For friend is plighting friendship unto friend, O, grateful tryst, none in this world more dear, Love oft begins where friendship finds its end. THY WILL, O LORD, NOT MINE. I do not like the leaden skies, Through which no sun doth shine, Nor the rough way my pathway lies, But, Lord, Thy will, not mine. I do not like the forest dark, Where whistling winds doth blow; But I will bravely walk therein, Because God wills it so. I do not like life's ocean rough, Its tempests and its gale; But till God sayest 'tis enough, My efforts shall not fail. I do not like the desert sands, That scorch and weary me; But on I plod, though faint and weak, If, Lord, it pleaseth Thee. Contented though with failing strength, To follow day by day; Assured that I shall rest at length, If, Lord, Thou lead the way. THE SPAN OF LIFE. How brittle is the thread of life, Its moments all how fleeting; 'Tis but an hour of pain and strife, Then still the heart's wild beating. 'Tis but a crimson carnage field, Where fast the bullets rattle; Death conquering comes, we vanquished yield, So endeth life's great battle. With earnest effort we but strive, The cord of life to lengthen; We may to man's allotment live, If God our weakness strengthen. 'Tis but a vapor failing fast, With might we are pursuing; And lest to-day should be our last, Let us be up and doing. WHEN, LOVE, I NEED THEE MOST. At morn when gentle breezes play, When sunshine lightens up the day, When ripples shake the ocean's coast, Or when the wind its powers boast, At night, when all is drear and dark, When skies forbid a single spark; In winter, when the low winds whine, Or summer, with its mellow chime; When flowers nod their dainty head, Or yet, when leaves lie prone and dead; When I delight thy face to see, Or would that love should come to me, I cannot say when best the time, For, love, I need thee all the time. If breezes soft sweep o'er my brow, My heart cries, love, I need thee now; If storms of sorrow darkly come, I weep for love, and feel alone. If skies are blue, and bright and fair, Or when the white down floats in air, In mirthful song, or mournful rhyme, Come, love, I need thee all the time. To help me sorrows great to bear, Or in my love's Elysium share; I shall not note the season's change, And trouble will be ever strange, If brightly still love's flame doth shine, I need thee, love, yes, all the time. O, light my path with thy fond voice, And make my happy heart rejoice; Be constant, true, until the end, Thy radiance on my dark way spend; My life is woven into thine, So, love, I need thee all the time. TO BISHOP ALLEN'S MEMORY. Shall we forget with each returning year To turn aside from life's exacting claims, Beside thy sacred mound to stop and shed a tear, And reverently speak thy sacred name? Thou wert among the soldiers, strong and brave, With ardent heart of love for liberty; Thou fillest well a sainted hero's grave, And leavest us a hero's legacy. The freedom thou didst purchase with thy prayer, “To worship God untrammelled on thy knees, The slave's petition rent the hallowed air, And floated heavenward on the Sabbath breeze.” And heaven itself was stirred by thy sad plea, And God looked pitying down on thee and smiled, Ask what thou wilt, and I will grant it thee, Abundant grace is toward the undefiled. Whoever doth my little ones offend, Had best a millstone tied about his neck; The raging sea shall be their sudden end, And heaven shall pass, ere yet my word shall break. Thou askedst, “We might serve him where we wilt, From the oppressor's ruthless hand be free; Our peans to raise for him who bore our guilt, On dark Golgotha's height on Calvary's rugged tree.” The answer came, that thenceforth thee and thine Should unmolested bow, beneath thine own tree's shade, Should eat the fruit borne by thy fig tree's vine, No voice to startle, none make thee afraid. A century past, and millions chant God's praise, Who through the ages doth his promise keep; The echoing isles, and mountains silence break, The breezes heavenward waft our grateful lays. Rest, sainted sire; peace guard thy well-won sleep— We, too, shall enter soon the shadowy vale; As years roll on in their majestic sweep, Our gratitude to thee shall never fail. THE WANDERER RECLAIMED. A desert and a weary way I trod, By gloomy night shut in on every side; My heavy eyes scarce upward turned to God, I wandered on the waste so wild and wide. Footsore and faint, no voice at my command— A thirst I felt, that I must surely die; If no one quickly lent a helping hand, No ear should hear my feebler growing cry. The darkness of the night to that within, Compared, was whiteness—all was as the grave; With wasting sores, corruption, worms and sin, As are the banks the Styx's waters lave. Unto my knees I lifted me and crept, With bended head and face o'erspread with shame; Unto the Saviour's feet I crawled and wept, In weakness I could only gasp His name. He stood above me with his pitying gaze, Then stooped and touched me, vilest of the vile; New strength was mine, was hymns of joy I raise, I shout, the Master owns me for His child. No more I wander in a sinful path— I follow in the way the Saviour trod: Upward my way, I will not fear the wrath And judgment of my great forgiving God. THE RETURNED LETTERS. Over and over I read the dear letters— Letters so freighted with hope and with joy; Breathings of hope from a heart in love's fetters, Whisperings such only as love could employ. Pleas for sustenance through life's changing phazes, Brought from the deepest recess of the soul; Hopings of happiness in love's embrace, When from our love's sky the clouds should all roll. Bright were the moments those words had been uttered— Happy the hearts in each other's entwine; Holy vows plighted, the while our hearts fluttered, Plighted devotion till life should decline. Ah! but the tempter has entered my Eden, Plucking the flowers 'twas dearest to me; Out of my life all the joy has receded, Lost like a ship on the restless blue sea. Changed is the heart that I trusted and cherished— Gone is the anchor of hope from my heart; Wrecked on life's rocks all my sweet joy has perished; Henceforth forever our lives lie apart. False is the eye at whose glance my heart bounded, False are the lips that were pressed to my own; False were the echoing notes that had sounded, Like richest music in his voice's tone. HYPOCRISY. O, Hypocrisy, thou evil-minded, forked tongued and hydra-headed monster. Thou hast assumed the guise of truth, and spread the veil of honor o'er thy wicked face, and shod by feet with sandals of uprightness, but from thy polluted lips spring the odors of the putre— faction within thy sin-coated heart. Thou stalkest abroad, trailing thine assumed habiliments with a feigned, saint-like pride, but thy unsteady steps betray thy falsity. In thy hand thou bearest a bludgeon wrapped about with gilded lies, and those who trust thee fall victims to thy deadly blows. Thou wouldest be called fidelity, but knowest thou not that truth is naked? In her innocence finding no necessity to enshrould her charms. Her form symmetrical, her face adorned by that pervading light, which borroweth its glory from the angels. Her feet are bare, they tread the highway of uprightness. Her breath is sweet as odors borne on zephyrs' wings from Paradise. Thou art a stalking error. TO MY FATHER. And wilt thou come no more, And walk the way so often trod? No; henceforth on that bright celestial shore Thou'lt dwell with God. How long and rudely tossed, Thy life bark on this troubled sea; God guided thee, and thou hast safely crossed To blest Eternity. IN MEMORIAM OF MOTHER. In memoriam of Mrs. Annie M. Henderson, who departed this life for the bliss of heaven, one year ago, October, 22d, 1892. I miss thee, my mother, thy image is still The deepest impressed on my heart; And the tablet so faithful in death must be chill, Ere a line of that image depart. Thou wert torn from our side when we needed thee most, When our reason could measure thy worth, When we knew but too well that the image we'd lost, Could never be replaced upon earth. I miss thee, my mother. Oh, when do I not? Though I know 'twas the wisdom of heaven, That the deepest shade fell on my sinned spot, When that tide of devotion was riven. For when thou wert with me, my soul was below— I was chained to the world I then trod; My affections, my thoughts, were all earth-bound, But now they have followed thy spirit to God. CONSOLATION. Dear Lord, I oft am bowed in grief, Then earthly comforts flee; Naught else affords the sweet relief Which comes alone from thee. When sorrows like an angry sea Sweep inward o'er my soul, Then helpless, Lord, I fly to Thee, The waves thou dost control. Thy tender touch quick banisheth The pain within my breast; The trembling tear soon vanisheth At Thy divine behest. How vain is life and its delight When my own path I choose; As lonely wanderer by night My way I quickly loose. But, O, what comfort, Lord, is mine, What peace it doth afford; To talk within the light divine, Shed by thy precious word. WILL E'ER THERE COME A TIME? Dear heart, will e'er there come a time When I shall turn to thee For love responsive unto mine, And coldness only see? When vanished is the fond delight That once shone in your eyes, That day will be as darkest night, No joy in it could rise. If I should meet a chilling glance, Where mine was wont to see, Delight and joy in thy response, Love, that were death to me. As to the sturdy oak tree's cling, The tender ivy vine, O, may thy true affection be A strong support to mine. EXTRACTS FROM THE AUTHORS. Ah! to what grief a single deviation from the track of human duty leads. Byron. There is no happiness destroyer quite equal to that of a restless, impatient, always dissatisfied mind. Wadsworth. Human knowledge is the parent of doubt. Greville. Self trust is the essence of heroism. Emerson. To believe a business impossible is to make it so. Collier. Truth has rough flavors if we bite it through. George Eliott. Civility is the charm that attracts the love of all men. Bishop Horne. TO BISHOP TURNER. Stand up, thou mighty monarch, stand, With flashing eagle eye and flaming tongue, Till loud and long o'er this accursed land, The adamantine truths thou utterest shall be sung. The angry mutterings of a prejudicial host, But, like a gentle zephyr, fan thy brow, With clarion voice speak truth nor count the cost, Thy purpose shall be seen, though darkly now. 'Tis not that many do not understand The echo of the ringing of that knell, Which thou hast sounded, yet like cowards stand, Preferring sloth to future woe or weal. Who e'er so blind in thee dost not perceive A matchless leader for thy stricken race; Who scents the distant danger would relieve, And sights to a divine appointed place. They tremble, cringe and shrink from day to day, And fear their unknown power and strength to try— In bold adventure to attempt the way, Of men free born, to dare and do or die. But lead thou on, perhaps though now alone, To these more heavy visioned shall be shown, A land where men white, or black are one, And freedom shares the chariot of the sun. EXTRACTS FROM THE AUTHORS. Company, villainous company, hath been the ruin of me. Shakespeare. The intellect is perfected not by knowledge, but by activity. Aristotle. The difficulties with which we are met are the maids of honor which set off virtue. Bolieve. What gift has Providence bestowed on man that is so dear to him as his children. Cicero. He is incapable of a truly good action who finds not a pleasure in contemplating the good actions of others. Lavater. The wealth of a man is the number of things which he loves and blesses, which he is loved and blessed by. Carlyle. A DREAM. I dreampt of you, sweetheart, last night, 'Twas not a dream of bliss; I saw another in your arms Receive a loving kiss. I saw you raise another's head Aloft to meet your own, And gaze with rapture on a face Which in its pleasure shone. I saw your long, dark lashes sweep Your crimson mantled cheek; Your bosom heave with passion deep, Your lips about to speak. And O, what torture, love, was mine, My heart with anguish burned; And from the scene my tearful eyes A painful witness turned. Had heaven no pity? It did seem I prayed for some relief; I woke and wondered that a dream Could wring my heart with grief. 'Tis morn, and I am glad again, For in your eyes a gleam Of love and joy dispels the pain I witnessed in that dream. Sometimes the engines of our anatomy are overheated by the fire of our ambition, and explosion would follow were it not that God touches some little valve in the machinery and allows an escape for our excess of steam. Danger is imminent wherever there is an excess of zeal. True heroism consists of a thorough knowledge and control of oneself. A truly great man chafes not under forced and unjustly imposed circumstances, but applies the balm of patience to the uncomfortable situation, hope enabling him to perceive light ahead. EXTRACTS AND QUOTATIONS. “Our seasons have no fixed returns, Without our will they come and go; At noon our sudden summer burns, At sunset all is snow.” Lowell. “A vile conceit in pompous words expressed Is like a clown in royal purple dressed.” —Anon. FORSAKEN I sit in the fading twilight here, But he comes not my heart to cheer; And swelling waves of sorrow roll Across my faint and weary soul. There's nothing left me now but sighs, My starved affection's piteous cries Are answered by a look or tone, As recent winds from frigid zone. AMBITION. Mine ear was dull, my harp unstrung, Rich melodies of mirth unsung, My heart deceived (with woe was wrung), Lay motionless and dead. But there came one with mien wise, With sympathy and tender eyes, And wooed my sluggish powers to rise, Hope's wings once more to spread. Once more my heart ambition stirred, Aroused to life by one kind word, Which I had craved, but had not heard, Dormant my hopes had lain. For him whose legal interest, Should first and last made manifest, A mutual zeal (of love the test), I sought, alas, in vain. But heaven sent me on a day, (When sorrow shadowed all my way), A friend with earnestness to say: Bestir thee: To thy post. THE FIRST FLAKES THAT FELL ON MOTHER'S GRAVE. There's a quiet little spot That is all the world to me, Where the treasure of my life so calmly sleeps. 'Tis my dear old mother's grave, Over which the willows wave, And the heavenly angels nightly vigils keep. Yes, the dearest face to me, In this life no more I'll see, Yet I'll follow in her precepts day by day; All the birds have lost their song, All the days seem dark and long, Since my dearest earthly friend was laid away. But the winter's biting blast Cannot chill thee as they pass, Can not chill thee as they pass, And the snow doth softly lay upon the ground; Here alone I sit and grieve, While the angel's fingers weave A snowy covering for thy precious mound. Rest, my sainted mother, rest, On the loving Saviour's breast, Till the day that he shall come to claim his own; I shall greet the blood-washed throng, You the shining ones among, With songs of praises round the great white throne. Peaceful be thy gentle sleep, Mother, while I sit and weep, And the willows gently whisper as they wave; O, thy memory is dear, And thy spirit hovers near, While the first flakes are falling on thy grave. WHEN WE ARE DEAD. O, the good things said of us when we are dead, If only while we live that they were said; Many a heart were spared a sigh, Joy would lighten many an eye, Where sorrow's weight we often bear instead. We approach the couch of death with quiet dread, With tender tone and very softest tread; As if we feared the slumberer to disturb, We speak with only kindly eyes and word. The dead are sightless, and the lips are dumb, And dull the hearing, never more shall come, The pang by us inspired of weary pain, Into that pulseless bosom ever again. But could we rouse again to life that clay, Which once we loved, but now so senseless lay; No act or speech, or look should e'er offend Our dear departed relative or friend. And so through life we heavy-hearted go, Within our heart a chamber filled with woe, Then let us turn from those who've passed away, Unto the living whom we meet each day. The dead are dead, they neither feel nor hear, Let tender words fall on an ear Who knows how much of comfort it will impart, A kind word falling on a troubled heart. FADED FLOWERS. I've a little bunch of flowers, Which were pressed by mother's hand, Ere we laid her form forever neath the sod, When her loving eyes had looked their last Upon this lowly land, And her spirit winged its upward flight to God. Old time has changed their gorgeous hue To that of sombre brown, The emerald leaves are crumbling to decay. But in my heart there ever lives Her image fond and true, Which I shall cherish to my dying day. This life seems far less bright to me, And friendship cold and strange, The summer skies have lost their gold and blue, The seasons sadly come and go. I reckon not their change, Since mother's face is hidden from my view. The happy birds in springtime wake Their joyful notes in vain, No more I seek the woodland's cool retreat. My sad and longing heart can find No comfort for its pain, No matter whither tend my weary feet. But in that far off happy land, That home of light above, Where heavenly flowers dispel their odors sweet, I know that mother patiently awaits with eyes of love The coming of her children there to greet. “AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS.” O, muse away—intrude not on this calm, My heart and I are weary of life's woes; I fain would sit alone, my heart and I commune, While God draws very near and lends a listening ear To my poor plea. O, muse away— And leave me but to-day— Break not the spell so soon. My room is dark, the curtains close are drawn, But that might not have been, the room was dark since dawn; I stole aside to pray, I had a burden hard to bear, And sought my chamber walls, that on the altar there, My offering I'd lay, but ere I knelt I found I was not all alone, for I could hear a sound, A voice besides my own. It was no human tongue that raised the song I knew; It was my soul that sang, inspired, O, muse by you; With tear-dimmed eyes I raised my burning heart's desire, Then waited, tremblingly, for God's descending fire. I waited long, and thought that I had prayed in vain, Not as the “rushing wind” or still small voice it came, Nor as Elijah's flame. But I could hear God say, “Believe and trust my word.” (The God that notes the fall of e'en a tiny bird.) Saith, “Faithless child, the answer is with thee; Ask what thou wilt in my name, I will grant it thee. The light stole in, the truth revealed at last, 'Tis as you pray the answer is, And it shall come to pass. THE DYING SLAVE'S REQUEST. Old Massa I am dying now, Your face I cannot see, Before I leave this world below, This promise give to me. I've done my best to serve you well, Your barns are filled with store, Before I bid you now farewell, Grant this I ask no more. My wife and babe I now must leave, They silent weep for me, 'Tis not for parting which I grieve, I pray that they were free. Now, Massa, I am growing weak, This favor grant to me, Quick while I yet may hear you speak, Say, Massa, they are free. I once was foremost in the throng, That plowed the rich corn field, I hear the echo of that song, Which loud to heaven appealed. From early dawn old Tom would toil, But now he'll soon be dead, No longer can he till the soil, That it may yield you bread. The cotton fields fade from my sight, The meadows golden grain, The day is darkening into night, I'll ne'er see dawn again. But there's a joy within my breast, And end of misery, The weary slave at last finds rest, His soul at last is free. Before I'm laid beneath the sod, This promise make to me, I'll pass in peace to be with God, My wife and child are free. IN MEMORY OF THE HON. FREDERICK DOUGLASS, THE SAGE OF ANACOSTIA. At last, at last the sage of Anacostia is at rest, And eager throngs have passed beside his bier, To gaze with sorrow in each throbbing breast, And to his noble memory drop a tear. At rest, ah yes, from years of weary toil, Of restless seeking for a freeman's boon, The offspring of Columbia's boasted soil, Yields to that lot which cometh late or soon. The sunshine of his youth by clouds was dim, Laid in the lowly cradle of a slave, The land of Liberty denied to him, Which bounty to her other sons she gave. When to the years of manhood he attained, He gazed in terror on his fettered hands, And e'en the thought of serfdom he disdained, And sought for freedom though in foreign lands. Ambition swelled his bosom with its fire, A specimen of manhood noble, true, To lofty heights his zeal did e'er aspire, He chose the path of honor to pursue. In all his native land no single spot, No mount nor vale to which he might retire, And claim his breath his own, O, cursed lot, His love for freedom fed his great desire. And when at last he found he could endure, No more the oppressing yoks of slavery's bond, Resolved on flight to England's welcome shore, The ocean braved to reach that land beyond. And liberty aroused the dormant strength, Pent in the mind and bosom of the slave, His silvery voice and tongue were free at length, He now possessed the burthen of his crave. And to the world the bitter story told, While millions hung upon his words that burned, How human flesh by men was bought and sold, He fled because a bondsman's lot he spurned. He saw at last his native land engaged In civil strife and seas of human blood, Poured out on soil where wild the conflict raged, And slavery sink beneath the gory flood. Scarce had been cleared the field of death and smoke, Ere rang his eloquence both loud and clear, The shattered manacle and cruel yoke, Aside were cast for liberty so dear. So to the lofty apex of renown, In foreign land or native land of birth, He wore with dignity the hero's crown, Deserved emblem of a hero's worth. A life unselfish now has reached its close, It's latest effort in defense of right, Now finds a peaceful and well-won repose, In realms of bliss and everlasting light. GOOD BYE. What word is there That can compare, In bitterness of tone, When heart from heart, Is forced to part, From loving ones and home? Tears dim the eye, How e'er we try, With courage brave to meet, The sad ordeal, We keenly feel, The words though sad, yet sweet. Of fortune great, Or fickle fate, Children of destiny, God knows the end, Our ways portend, To us a mystery. If it might be That we could see The life that lies between, Or what the fate That doth await Through days that intervene. God wills it so, We may not know, No human power descry, On sea or land, Within his hand, Our destiny must lie. Hope fills the breast, And lulls to rest, The burdened heart-felt sigh, The mizpah be, Twixt thee and me, When we have said Good-Bye. DOING. Doing something, do it well, Let your efforts ever tell, Of a purpose firm and true, Keep the golden rule in view. Be engaged in doing good, Motives pure and understood; In life's struggle take a part, With a brave, yet tender heart. Woes of others freely share, Words of kindness never spare, Weep with those in sad distress, Joy in others' happiness. Do not coldly criticise Erring ones, nor yet despise, Speak not with disparity, Spread the veil of charity. Of the faults you chance to see, In another pityingly, Brush the tear drop from the cheek, Take his hand and kindly speak. Words are things of little cost, Souls for lack of them are lost, And to others ever do, As you'd wish it done by you. THE SLAVE MOTHER'S CRIME. “Yes, I'm guilty,” the woman said, And tossed with pride her shapely head, Her flashing eye looked fierce the while, Her teeth gleamed through a scornful smile, As up she raised her fettered hands, Imprisoned with the iron bands. And wildly heaved her throbbing breast, Close to the council rail she pressed, Then turned, the accusing court to face, No sign of pity could she trace; Each eye was set with stony stare, On her, the picture of despair. “Unbind me, men, there is no need, These iron chains, I did the deed, If ye be men, unbind me now, I did the deed, I'll tell you how.” The white child lay upon my breast, As like a birdling in its nest, An nursed my blood and cooed in glee, And when I smiled, smiled back at me. Think you I had no mother love? That priceless thing all else above, I fondled it, and ere 'twas long, The weakling babe grew hale and strong; And when I held it on my knee, How strangely would it look at me; I looked into its deep blue eyes, And saw contempt for me arise, For me—its mother—black as night, Was hateful in the white child's sight. The master's blood in every vein, For the black mother held disdain, His lips would curl in scornful mirth, Of the black source which gave him birth. How could I nurse my child with pride, A mother ere I'd been a bride, And in the “great house” over there, Another babe lay sweet and fair, The proud white mother's babe for him. As like my own as any twin. I toiled all day, neath the fiery skies, No time to soothe my infant's cries, And in the field with me close by, Another toiled, whose manly eye Looked on in pity not in blame, With charity upon my shame; He always helped me do my task, And for my love one day did ask The master, who this answer gave, A laugh of scorn—no, she's my slave. Jack pined, and to his death soon went, With pain his anguished heart was rent, I sorely grieved but could not die, And as the days passed slowly by, My life with sorrow shadowed o'er, 'Twas then this fearful vow I swore; Out in the darkness I could see Jack's welcome arms awaiting me, The white child only lay between Jack's open arms and joy supreme. It would not die, I wished it so, That I at length to Jack might go, I wished it so, it would not die, To Jack and freedom I might fly; My hate was strong, I prayed each day That death would take the child away, For if the bastard child should live, What could a poor slave mother give, For often had the master sold, His flesh and blood for love of gold. And as the days went slowly past, My heart seemed turned to stone at last, Down in the dark and shaded wood, Beside a stream and old oak stood, Close by the rocks lay grey and bare, Black fell the slanting shadows there, I took the child close to my breast, A moment, loath with it to part, A mother's love awoke again, How could I see the infant slain? Were it not better it should die, While yet a babe, than live like I Had lived to be the white man's slave? Yes, better far the quiet grave, How should it die? This I must choose, I must be quick, no time to loose, The wind blew keen across the wold, I shuddered for the night was cold, And laid the child upon the ground, Then with two stones I dug around The roots of that decaying tree, The moist soil moved easily. My thread-bare shawl I snatched away, And took the child from where it lay, My apron, too, was strong and stout, I wrapped him tight and close and warm, That here forever safe from harm, While white-robed angels watch would keep, O'er this, the infant's last long sleep. Into the earthen cradle scooped, I placed the child who soundly slept, Then to the meadow soft I crept, And stole a covering for the child; Above his little grave I strewed The hay, what if his bed were rude? When he should wake it would be light In heaven with angels pure and bright. Now ye know all the dreadful tale, Ha, ye are cowards poor and pale, What, do I see a shining tear? Now do your worst, I have no fear, I scorn your pity, I a slave, Can die as bravest of the brave. Quick, pass the sentence, I would fain Be happy with my Jack again. Her breath came quick, and then in gasps, Around the room one glance she casts, Low on her bosom dropped her head, One cry of pain, and she lay dead. WHERE ARE THE PRAYERS. Where are the prayers we prayed on yesterday, Or is it, Lord, the prayers we only said, That traveled not the length to heaven's highway, But mist-like rose no higher than our head? Where are the pleas, from burdened hearts sore rent, The earnest petition of the penitent, Were they the hearts profound and earnest pleas, Such as thou hearest when on bended knees, We weak and faint, sick, weary, and alone, Whisper, O Father, in a softened tone. Were they in substance careless yet and cold, And not the craving of a spirit bold, We stand and wonder what the cause can be, Thou dost not grant the favor asked of thee. If we pray our prayer to thee, Thine answer never tarries, Often we but say our prayer, The answer then miscarries. COULD YOU TELL ME A FALSEHOOD? Could you tell me a falsehood, darling, As I look into your eyes, And there behold the glory Of the mellow summer skies? From virtue's crystal fountain, Which in your bosom lies, There beauteous truth reflected, Smiles through your lovely eyes. What are life's storms and crosses, The worst that e'er could be, I'd count among my losses, Your faithfulness to me. As doth the clinging ivy, The sturdy oak entwine, So doth my heart depend, love, On faith and truth in thine. “Who broods over the past loses courage for the future. Bury deep your mistakes, your sins if need be, and write on the gravestone: ‘God being my helper I will begin anew and build better.’” —Sidney Lanier. “The value of a thought cannot be told: it broadens the horizon, it lifts the heart and inspires the soul to worthy and vital aims. As a man thinks so is he; as a man wills, he may become by cultivating a special habit of thought.” —Longfellow. “The neglecting of a duty is next to the commission of a crime.” GOD IS NEAR THEE. How near is God to me? I never seem to know Until affliction's hand Has dealt a telling blow. All human aid I seek, Appeal and power is spent, Then trembling, faint and weak, Aloft my cry is sent. When through the mists so dim, I peer and feel alone, He calleth me to Him, In love's persuasive tone. Why do I ever stray From following my guide, Why tread a dangerous way, A far from his dear side? How near is God to me? 'Tis only when I raise My weary eyes I see The smile upon his face. When is God near to me? Whene'er to Him I go, He hearkens unto me In my distress and woe. JESUS, SAVIOUR, PILOT, SAVE. When from earth my lonely bark Shall be launched upon the wave, O' death's waters deep and dark, Jesus, Saviour, Pilot, Save. When my eyes a parting view, Of my loved ones here shall take, Jesus, Pilot tried and true, Grant safe voyage I shall make. Let me look time's landscape o'er, Conscience free from sin and care, On eternity's blest shore, Grant I may thy glory share. HE THAT COMETH TO ME I WILL IN NOWISE CAST OUT. (Tune, “Federal Street,” L. M.) Lord, on thy promise I rely, That thou wilt hear a sinner's cry In every trying time of need, And prove thyself a friend indeed. Lo, at thy feet I humbly fall, And on thy mercy great I call, O! turn to me thy smiling face, Send me abundance of thy grace. Condemned by the most sacred law, Which broken is each breath I draw, Lord, only on thy grace I lean, Thy power doth make the foulest clean. To count thy mercies I begin, And, hark, a voice comes from within, When shall the countless blessings end, Which thou to me doth daily send? When I would closely follow thee, Evil doth present walk with me, And trials sore my way beset, And doubtings in my heart beget. Still I will fully trust in Thee, Who sacrificed thy Son for me, Whose blood was shed on Calvery. Atoning Lamb to set me free. LEND A HAND. There's a mighty battle raging, Right and wrong in mortal strife, Volunteers are now engaging, Battling for eternal life. Can you hear the heathen weeping, Yet so calm and idly stand; Or indulge in sloth and sleeping? Lend a hand, a helping hand. CHORUS. Tell me, Christians, worn and weary, Toiling on life's pathway dim, Are you shedding light for Jesus, Are you witnessing for him? Hark! a voice from o'er the ocean, From the distant isles and seas, Hark! and you will hear the echo Floating on each passing breeze. Plaintively its tones are pealing, As a soul bowed low in grief, For the gospel's light revealing, Send, oh send the sweet relief. As a famished infant crying, That its hunger may be fed, Many souls in darkness dying, Plead for life's eternal bread. Will you be a valiant soldier, With a purpose firm and true? Holding high the blood-stained banner, God the Master needeth you. When the Master of the vineyard Comes the laborers to repay, Shall you be among the faithful, Or the idlers by the way? Though you may not be a captain, Leading on a mighty band, You can be an armor-bearer, Following at God's command. Though the conflict wildly rages, Pressing hot to heaven's gate, Whosoever here engages, Him a just reward awaits. You may not possess a palace, You may wear no title grand, You can aid in saving lost ones, Lend a hand, a helping hand. TIMES AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED. (Tune, “Auld Lang Syne.”) The times are very different now From what they used to be, When I was but a little child Upon my mother's knee. Abandoned are the good old hymns At church we used to sing, And operatic airs are now Considered quite the thing. You hear no more of Afton sweet, Nor Siloam's shady rill, 'Tis Clementi or Chopin now, The sacred arches fill. We've lost the substance of our song, And to the shadow cling, The god of gold we worship When we make our offering. We used to go to church to get Our stock of faith renewed, And hungry hearts were feasted there, On spiritual food. But many of the preachers now, Are filled so full of self, There is no room for Jesus, Nor for anybody else. Our pulpits used to be adorned By men of unction full, But now they're filled by men Who with the Bishop's got a pull. And preachers are the leaders now Of local politics, They wear no more the saintly brow, But play all sorts of tricks. Of modern times our language, too, Has greatly been abused, I pray I may be pardoned For some terms I'm forced to use. For fads and slang are popular, And to be “up-to-date,” The language has been modernized To suit our rapid gait. When I was young another thing I'm sure they never did, In speaking of a little child Call it “a little kid.” When men committed theft they got The natural name of rogue, But now “they've made a slight mistake,” Insanity is vogue. When once a year we got a frock, We made it plain always, Our waists would not give you a shock, We were no slaves to stays. A man wore shirt, and coat, and hat, And homespun pantaloons, But women now wear all of these And sleeves made like balloons. A rogue was not a gentleman, If he were high or low, And robbed a bank or hen-coop, He to prison sure would go. But now a man who pilfers bread, Is almost sure to swing, Or serve a lifetime pennance, For he was not in “the ring.” The Bible even has been changed To suit this rapid age, Once we believed what'er we read On every blessed page. If one committed suicide, 'Twas said he went below, But now the preacher shakes his head And says he doesn't know. It once was thought a camel Through a needle's eye could go, As easy as a man to heaven, Who hoarded wealth below. But now the richest man can get A seat in Paradise, The nearest next the throne if he But chose to pay the price. And great men once were reckoned By upright and moral lives, But he is greatest now who boasts His own and neighbor's wives. Young ladies were the modest girls, Both gentle and demure, When crowned with queenly virtue, And no other jewel wore. Our national and other laws Are made on rubber lines. They stretch or contract easily To suit them to the times. The city government is changed, 'Tis managed now by bands That squander recklessly the means Entrusted to their hands. A tax is placed on everything, No matter great or small, The question next I guess they'll spring, If we shall live at all (?) One almost wearies of one's life, Such wickedness to see, So much of bitterness and strife, There never used to be. A hundred other little things, Of which I might take note, I must omit, but must remark That women now can vote. So in despair I sadly bow, But you'll agree with me, That things decidedly have changed From what they used to be.</field>
