      <field name="fulltext">The Path of Dreams Sweet-scented winds move inward from the shore, Blythe is the air of June with silken gleams, My roving fancy treads at will once more, The golden path of dreams. Along the sloping uplands yellow wheat Is bending to the honied breath of June, While all the lowlands slumber at my feet This glorious afternoon. To balmy gusts from blue-girt breezy hills The clover blossoms nod with graceful art, And all the mystery of living thrills The ever pulsing heart. A boon to lovers still, the sweet wild rose Adds perfume to the languor in the air, And whispering Zephyr scatters as she goes Sweet atters everywhere. The wild birds restlessly from tree to tree, Flit ceaselessly beneath the sunlit skies, And give a sumptuous afternoon to me, In song and gladsome cries. Blue gauze the empty distances enfold; The stream-fed glens lie bare in loveliness, And waves of light along the paths of gold The glens and hills caress. In garish light the rustling, shimmering corn, The trembling leaves, the passing winds caress, And in the heart a subtle throb is born Of mighty tenderness. Vague yearnings, tenderness that prompt to tears And fill the heart with mingled pain and bliss, Come down to men through many thousand years, On afternoons like this. What is there in the vistas, song, and flower, That prompt alike to happiness and tears, Unites life's scattered visions in the hour Of past and present years? Is it the throb of life on soft hill slopes, A thousand passions burned to fever heat Spread out in shimmering glows that run to hopes, For some fulfillment sweet? Some half fulfillment yet of vanished gleams, Of vanished promises when love's wild glow Made fervid youth a tenement of dreams Back in the long ago. DAYBREAK Awake! arise! Oh, men of my race, I see our morning star, And feel the dawn-breeze on my face Creep inward, from afar. I feel the dawn, with soft-like tread, Steal through our lingering night, Aglow with flame our sky to spread In floods of morning light. Arise! my men, be wide awake To hear the bugle call, For Negroes everywhere to break The bands that bind us all. Great Lincoln, now with glory graced, All God-like with the pen, Our chattel fetters broke, and placed Us in the ranks of men. But even he could not awake The dead, nor make alive, Nor change stern nature's laws which make The fittest to survive. Let every man his soul inure, In noblest sacrifice, And with a heart of oak endure, Ignoble, arrant prejudice. Endurance, love, will yet prevail Against all laws of hate; Such armaments can never fail Our race its best estate. Let none make common cause with sin, Be that in honor bound, For they who fight with God must win On every battle ground. Though wrongs there are, and wrongs have been, And wrongs we still must face, We have more friends than foes within The Anglo-Saxon race. In spite of all the babel cries, Of those who rage and shout, God's silent forces daily rise To bring His will about. Our portion is, and yet will be, To drink a bitter cup In many things, yet all must see The race is moving up. Oh! men of my race, awake! arise! Our morning's in the air, There's scarlet all along the skies, Our day breaks everywhere. TO HOLLYHOCKS Gay hollyhocks with flaming bells And waving plumes, as gently swells The breeze upon the Summer air; You bind me still with magic spells When to the wind, in grave farewells, You bow in all your graces fair. You bring me back the childhood view, Where arching skies and deepest blue Stretch on in endless lengths above; To see you so awakes anew Long past emotions, from which grew My wild and first heart-throbs of love. There is in all your brilliant dyes, Your gorgeousness and azure skies, A joy like soothing summer rain; Yet in the scene there vaguely lies A something half akin to sighs, Along the borderland of pain. SPRING DAWN There comes to my heart from regions remote A wild desire for the hedge and the brush, Whenever I hear the first wild note Of the meadow lark and the hermit thrush. The broken and upturned earth to the air, By a million thrusting blades of Spring, Sends out from the sod and everywhere Its pungent aromas over everything. Then it's Oh, for the hills, the dawn, and the dew, The breath of the fields and the silent lake, And watching the wings of light burst through The scarlet blush of the new daybreak. It is then, when the earth still nestles in sleep, And the robes of light are scarce unfurled, You can almost feel, in its mighty sweep, The onward rush and roll of the world. THE EPHEMERA Creatures of gauze and velvet wings, With life for one brief day, Dancing and flitting where the breezes fling The sweets of blooming May; Skimming the stream where the wild thyme grows, You dart with keen delight, Only to die when the sweet wild rose Gives perfume to the night. Weary at last, when the day is done, Of the breeze and clover's breath, Folding your delicate wings with the sun, You gently drop to death; Glimmering wings and a few short hours Were yours in sweet delight, Living for a day in the world of flowers, And thenâeverlasting night. Creatures of gauze and velvet wings, With a day of gleams and flowers, Who knowsâin the light of eternal thingsâ Your life is less than ours? Weary at last, it is ours, like you, When our brief day is done, Folding our hands, to say adieu, And pass with the setting sun. THE HILLS OF SEWANEE Sewanee Hills of dear delight, Prompting my dreams that used to be, I know you are waiting me still tonight By the Unika Range of Tennessee. The blinking stars in endless space, The broad moonlight and silvery gleams, Tonight caress your wind-swept face, And fold you in a thousand dreams. Your far outlines, less seen than felt, Which wind with hill propensities, In moonlight dreams I see you melt Away in vague immensities. And, far away, I still can feel Your mystery that ever speaks Of vanished things, as shadows steal Across your breast and rugged peaks. O, dear blue hills, that lie apart, And wait so patiently down there, Your peace takes hold upon my heart And makes its burden less to bear. HYDROMEL AND RUE Lord, let me live to serve and make a loan Of life and soul in love to my heart's own. And what if they should never care or know How dark sometimes and weary are the ways, How piercing cold and pitiless the snow, How desolate and lonely are the days Which life for me holds sometimes in reserve? And what if those I love esteem above Me, others all untried and far less true, And lightly barter off my wealth of love For careless, strange, and passing comrads new? Oh Lord, those, whom I love, I still would serve. To be permitted, once in this short life, To hold a little child close to my heart In fatherhood, as mine, is worth all strife Which circumstance and time to me impart. To know the bliss of chaste and holy love, To have one friend to even half divine My hungry heart, is heaven from above Come to this ever-longing soul of mine. And so, dear Lord, I thank Thee for the cup Of hydromel Thou givest me to sup, Though rue and hyssop pass my lips and fill My life with earthly sorrow, grief, and pain, In faith my soul will rise to thank Thee still For garish day, for guerdon and its gain. And though through time insentient clay, the sward, My erstwhile form may hold; for joy, for life, For everlasting love, sunshine and rain, My ardent heart above all earthly strife, Unbound in space, soars up through joy and pain Triumphantly, in thanks to Thee, dear Lord. THE BRIDE OF NITTA YUMA. Softly the cool breath of the early morning, Swamp-scented air, fragrant with deep lagoons And water lilies, stole on through the fields Of cotton, whispering a sighing song. 'Twas Sunday morning then, and everywhere The May dew rolled away in diadems. Another day was born with floods of light; The grass with newer green all wet with dew Gave welcoming. And rose hues spent with yesterday Found blushes still, and sent out night-born sweets To mingle with a thousand other spicy Airs, and perfumes of the jessamine, And wild aromas of the Summer air. And murmured low the sycamore overhead With whisperings of passing Summer winds. The dapple sunshine gleamed and kissed their leaves, And golden gleams were on the fields. Rich were The blackbird's notes, and joyous sounds from all The feathered tribes. In lazy lengths the bayou went With stretches on, and murmuring low songs Like those of love. There floated far and wide The queenly water liliesâwhite, perfuming All the Sunday air. And, like a dove Of peace, fair Nitta Yuma sat amid Her spreading figs and rich magnolia blooms, In rest; for there was come the hallowed day, The Sabbath of the Lord. The church bell pealed To far plantations for her worshippers. They came in straggling bands through cotton fields And shady lanes. Upon their faces, young And old, was seen a keen expectancy, And eagerness. It was the wedding day Of sweet Alicia Bell, the fairest maid, And most beloved of all the country side. And when the preacher called the happy pair To stand and take their vows, no costly veil Resplendent in transparency enwrapped The dusky bride, nor great Cathedral gleamed In rich mosaics, nor stately pillars carved, To mark the elegance and luxury Where come the great, the lordly, and the rich, To take their marriage vows. But love was there And hope, and youth, to guide and lead them forth To their new world. And to his humble home, With whitewashed walls, the bridegroom led his bride. The wedding feast of simple fare was theirs Alone. Through all the golden afternoon They took their bridal tour, still hand in hand, Love ever leading on, through cotton fields, Along the bayou's side, until their feet Led to the forest old, where man first loved, First wooed, first won a bride and made a home. Gently the spirit of the ancient forest Wove her magic spell around them, till, As one, they had no further need of speech. They were no longer twain, and on, as one, Slowly they walked through the fragrant and green woodsâ Woods sun-stained, and peaceful, where all nature Fused her mellow beauty into one Harmonious whole. Softened and blended colors Gleamed in vistas and in open glades; Delicious murmurs, inarticulate, Soothing all the senses, crept in quiet, Even undertones all through the forest, Whispering primeval memories, Primeval mysteries of ages past. Once more the ancient forest, dim and silent, Throbbed with energy and unseen life, Where sunshine fell among the moist ferns, Gleamed on silent pools and altars lost. Again the musty fragrance of the forest mould Greeted the nostrils of fauns and dryads Unseen, and all the fairy forest lived Once more, commingling with their murmurings The past and present. Here primordial love Walked hand in hand through Paradise anew. TO THEODORE Such are the little memories of you; They come and go, return and lie apart From all main things of life; yet more than they, With noiseless feet, they come and grip the heart. Gay laughter leading quick and stormy tears, Then smiles again and pulse of flying feet, In breathless chase of fleeting gossamers, Are memories so dear, so bitter-sweet. No more are echoes of your flying feet. Hard by, where Pike's Peak rears its head in state, The erstwhile rushing feet, with halting steps, For health's return in Denver watch and wait. But love and memories of noiseless tread, Where angels hovered once, all shining fair, To tuck you in your little trundle bed, Kneel nightly now in agony of prayer. Feb. 22, 1916. A NEW YEAR'S GREETING TO A COLLEGE SENIOR Soft winds and a moving tide May bear you on, I pray, With the love of God to guide Through the year to your B. A. On the shores of heavenly grace, Or the crest of the ocean's swell, May the smile of the Father's face Be the sign that all is well. In storms, whenever they rise, Cling close to the pilot of prayer, Keep faith under blackest of skies That the love of God is there. THE LEGEND OF TANNHAUSER AND ELIZABETH. The legend of Tannhauser and Elizabeth lends itself readily to a story more human than any other of the Wagner-opera legends. The restlessness of Tannhauser which leads him into such ultimate misfortune, and Elizabeth's undying love and devotion to him, are exhibitions of pathos and tragedy instinct with human life. The dethronement of Venus by the acceptance of Christianity throughout the world, by which she was robbed of her divinity, and relegated to the realms of the lower world to become a sorceress, is not less sorrowful than that of the sorrowful Elizabeth. Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was, according to the more ancient Greek conception, a daughter of Jupiter and Dione; but Hesiod says that she arose from the sea at the time of the wounding of Uranus and was therefore called by the Greeks, Aphrodite, the foam-born. Wafted by the west wind she was borne to the island of Cytherea, and afterward, like a dream, she passed to Cypress, where the grace of her beauty conquered every heart. She at once became the goddess of love and beauty, the goddess of gardens and flowers, of the rose, the myrtle and the linden. The heaths and slumberous vales, pleasant with Spring and the vernal breezes, were her's. She was the mistress of feminine charm and beauty, and ruled the hearts of men. Driven from her ancient kingdom, from the sunshine and the flowers of the upper world, it is no wonder that her heart grew hard, that we find her the wicked enchantress and sorceress that she is in the Venusburg, situated in the German valley of Thuringia. The version of the legend of Tannhauser here given at the end is a liberty taken, but it seemed to me inconsistent after his chastening to have him consider a return to the Venusburg. G. M. McClellan. I THE VENUSBURG In Germany the fabled Venusburg A broad and fertile valley overlooked, In fair Thuringia. The winds blew free Along the mountain slopes, where shepherds watched Their sheep, and played upon their pipes in sweet Contentment all the day, beneath the blue And arching sky. And in the valley rang Often the cheery cry of noble knights And jovial hunting parties on their way To visit Wartburg castle, in which dwelt The Landgrave, Herman, and his men-at-arms, And his brave knights of fair Thuringia. And with him dwelt his niece, Elizabeth, The princess of the realm. The minstrel knights And nobles, skilled in voice and on the harp, Were wont to gather in the Landgrave's hall And there contest in song. In this fine art The sweetest singer of Thuringia Was young Tannhauser, who, by his fair face And wondrous melodies in song, had won The heart of proud Elizabeth. And yet This noble knight was dreamy in his mood And restless in his life, dissatisfied, And longed for change and new experiences. And in this dreamy mood, with harp in hand, He passed, one day, the grotto of the Venusburg. The great enchantress of this fateful place Put forth her magic spells and drew him on. And when Tannhauser raised his eyes he saw A country beautiful and strangely new. As through a doorway seen, there flitted through The gleaming, ever-changing, rose-hued mist A countless throng of figures beautiful. And heavy-headed flowers sent to him Their all-compelling perfume through the air. And far away he saw the misty lakes Of magic blue. The sound of music came to him, So strangely sweet it almost gave him pain To hear. And in the midst of all there stood The great enchantress, smiling, beckoning him To come. So great her spell, he moved as in a dream, Into the grotto passed, and fancied that He heard a heavy door behind him clang. For one long year, with ever changing scenes, Tannhauser stayed within the Venusburg And thought that he was happy there. The change In shifting scenes, the wild bacchantes, and The nymphs in mimic war, in graceful dance, Afforded for his ever restless soul The wild excitement which he craved. And for His softer moods the chording voices of The sirens satisfied. He breathed the scent Of flowers wondrous sweet, and watched at times Dissolving mist-wreaths as they faded out Their rosy hues. With Venus long he sat At other times, and more and more she wove Her spells which bound him fast to her. She taught To him her songs of love, which he before Had never heard, and dazzled by her charms He worshipped her as did the world of old When she was grand and true and gave The gift of noble love to all humanity. Tannhauser, now enthralled by magic spells, Had long forgotten all his former lifeâ His friends, his love for fair Elizabeth, His love for God, for Christ and righteousness, And all the good and true which come to man By sacrifice and overcoming sin Were banished from his mind, so lost was he To all the life within the Venusburg. And yet, the restless nature of his soul That led him into sin was destined to Arouse him to his lost estate. One day Tannhauser felt himself awake once more. He fancied that he heard the clanging peals Of church bells far away, and through his mind There struggled back the long forgotten life; The sun, the friendly glimmer of the stars, The song of nightingales, the morning light, The freshness of the earth, the skies above, In memory came rushing through his mind. In wild appeal to Venus now he cried: âAre these things lost to me?â And, rising from Her couch, with quick though mild rebuke she bade Him call to mind for her a scene less sad, For she remembered well the world from which She was dethroned and basely relegated to This under-realm. Tannhauser, now aroused, Felt all his restlessness, and would not be Denied. In vain she wove about him now Her magic spells. Tannhauser pleaded for Releasement from her power, to live again His former life, to know the natural joys, The sorrows and the common things of earth. In wrath she charged him with ingratitude To her for all the lavished joys which she Had given him. But when she saw in vain Her wrath affected him, in softer tones She promised him more perfect joys, and things More beautiful. And while she spoke there came From over all the dim blue lakes the soft Caressing voices of the sirens in Their wondrous harmonies. âMy knight,â she cried, âWhy will you fly?â With stormy passion moved, Tannhauser seized his harp and smote the strings, And sang in mighty voice. He pledged to sing When in the upper world, of Venus and Her praise alone, but to that upper world He now must go. The great enchantress saw Her power on him now was gone, and bade him go. Then in a moment flashed away from him The Venusburg and all its wondrous spells; And, stretched full length upon the mountain side, Tannhauser found himself too weak to rise Up from the grassy slope at first. Confused In mind, up to the wide blue sky he gazed, While slowly came to him the memory Of all his former life, the bitter truth Of sin in going to the Venusburg. And from the pasture lands below he heard The sheep bells, where the peaceful shepherd lad Lay playing on his pipes, and pausing now and then To sing a song to Holda, goddess of The Spring. Across the quiet valley came The sounds of hunting horns, the baying of The hunting pack with full excitement for The chase, and stirred the lonely knight upon The mountain side to full activity. And soon the Landgrave and five minstrel knights Drew near and recognized Tannhauser, and With words of welcome and much kindness asked Where he had been. âI wandered in strange lands,â Tannhauser said. âI pray you question not, But let me pass.â The Landgrave saw his mood And courteously forbore to further press And question him, but pointed out how sad Had been the princess, fair Elizabeth, In his long absence from the hall, and asked That he should join the coming revels of The minstrelsy of song in Wartburg Hall. With gladness in his heart he promised to Attend. And now the heavens seemed to smile A pardon down on him, and sweet the wind Blew softly on his face. âElizabeth,â he said. The murmur of her name a sense of peace And freedom brought to him. And now once more He humbly prayed to God that he might be Forgiven for his sin, and find a peace Of heart, and full acceptance in His sight. II THE CONTEST OF SONG AND LOVE The Landgrave's gilded hall was all bedecked In preparation for the minstrel knights Who would contest in skill upon the harp. Though named were all contestants long before, Tannhauser's name was added to the list In recognition of his marvelous skill And, too, in honor of his coming home. Before the minstrel hour the princess, fair Elizabeth, came in the hall to feast Her eyes upon the place where, long before, Tannhauser's harp and voice awoke her heart To such fond sympathy and ardent love. When now at last he had returned her heart Was beating fast with its tumultous joy, And scarcely could await the hour when she Could see her noble knight and hear his voice again. At last the hour arrived, and to the hall The princess came. Her white, soft draperies, Embroidered in rich colors, fell around Her graceful form in many folds, and on Her brow a crown of fretted gold proclaimed Thuringia's princess, fair Elizabeth. She was of northern birth, in coloring Was fair, and had the clear blue eyes with which The daughters of the cold and far north skies So often are endowed. And for her hand The prince, brave knights and nobles from afar, Came suing ardently. To all of whom She was unfailing kind, but ever proud, And cold and stately in her pride, the pride In generations of her noble blood. One knight alone had touched her heart, and while He was away she turned her back upon The gayeties of the realm. But once again, Now that he had returned, her spirit thrilled With quickened heartbeats of her happiness, And sent its sparkling gleams to her blue eyes. Into the minstrel hall the noble knights Came, bearing each his harp. Elizabeth In queenly beauty stood with welcome smiles, But yet with searching eyes for one above All other knights. He came, by Wolfram led, In through a doorway at the side. âAh, there She is,âthe princess,â Wolfram softly said, And turned away, upon a pillar leaned All richly carved, and fixed his gaze upon The quiet beauty of the vale without. âO! princess fair!â he heard Tannhauser cry, And then her voice, with love, which softly said, âYou must not kneel to me.â He heard no more, Save now and then a word, a phrase which filled His heart with cold despair, for Wolfram, too, The princess loved, but in his noble heartâ His heart as noble as his nameâhe now Relinquished all his hopes for those he loved, And who would find their joy in mutual love. The Landgrave, smiling, came into the hall, And in her joy Elizabeth herself Threw in his arms, so great her happiness. Together mounted they the royal seat To wait the coming of the knights and guests, All bidden to the feast of love and song. Four pages called the guests as they arrived; The Landgrave, with all stately courtesy, The princess, with the utmost graciousness, Made welcome there the knights and all the guests, Arrayed in rich medieval dress. There stood Behind them all the men-at-arms; also The Landgrave's brave retainers lined the wall. The swinging lamps revealed the columns rich In carving. When the guests had all arrived, The Landgrave stood and said the contest was Of love in song, and he who won should have The hand of fair Elizabeth, he pledged; Not doubting once that he would win in song Who had already won Elizabeth In ardent love. âAll hail! Thuringia's lord!â The minstrels cried in greeting to his speech. Then came deep silence as the pages passed The golden cup in which each minstrel dropped A folded slip of paper with his name. Then from the golden cup Elizabeth Drew out a name and gave it to the page Who raised his voice and cried, âHerr Wolfram Eschenbach in song begin.â Upon his feet Von Eschenbach arose And to his harp's soft rippling cadences Began to sing: first of brave knights and to Fair ladies present in the hall. Then to Elizabeth his pent-up soul in song Poured out the mighty passion of his love. He sang in noble fervor to the star Of love embodied in the princess fair. Applause from all the guests and minstrels rang Save from Tannhauser, seeming lost in dreams, From which he did not rouse until the page Announced his name as next upon the slip Drawn by the princess from the golden cup. He took his harp, but hardly knowing what He did, for wild excitement seized his mind. Once more rose-colored mists before his eyes Arose, and voices whispered in his ears. He stood as blind, with throbbing heart, and swayed As sways an oak with storm and tempest tossed. âI, too, have seen the fount of love,â he cried, And then his vow, back in the Venusburg: That Venus, when he sang, should be his theme, Enchained his memory. He smote his harp And sang with stormy music till the roof With praise of Venus rang. Still higher rose His voice in eulogy of fairest, then, Of all enchantresses. At last he flung Away his harp and cried, âI fly, I fly Back to the Venusburg.â Entranced, transfixed, He stood, his harp unnoticed at his feet. In horror-stricken tones the nobles cried, âHear him! Hear him! So to the Venusburg This wandering knight has been. Press forward, all, And in his blood bathe every sword.â With cries The ladies hastened from the hall, save fair Elizabeth, who stood there shuddering Betwixt her horror and her mighty love. Increased the clamor and the great tumult From every side as came the cry, âKill him!â And, pressing on, the nobles drew their swords To do their deadly work. âBrave knights, stopâ cried Elizabeth; âOr else kill me. Stand back!â Her tones were full of mingled love and deep Despair, and yet surcharged with dignity And stern command. The nobles all fell back, Amazed to see their princess shield a wretch As was Tannhauser now. Her voice all full Of piteous tragedy continued in Her plea: âWhat is the wounds your swords could give To this death-stroke which has been dealt to me?â The nobles cried, âThis fallen and false knight You should be first indeed to scorn.â She said, âWhy do you speak of me? Of this poor knight, Of him and his salvation, you should speak. This knight, by dreadful magic bound, can yet, Through sorrow and repentance, break his chains, And win forgiveness from the pitying Lord. I plead for him, for his dear life I plead.â Tannhauser, softened by her pleading words And his own deep remorse, bowed low his head And wept. The knights, now softened by his grief, More gently spoke, but still in deep reproach. At last the Landgrave spoke with kindness and Command, the course Tannhauser must pursue, Because around him clung the magic spells And dark enchantment lingered in his heart. He must go forth and not return again To fair Thuringia till his soul was free From all the spells of Venus. He advised Tannhauser to unite himself with pilgrims, Then setting out for Rome to seek the Pope And pray for pardon for their sins. And while He talked there came from far without the chant Of voices sweet and low, which brought a peace And gentle rest into the minstrel hall, Which short before with strife and tumult rang. Tannhauser heard the chant; with rising hope And with a sudden impulse rose and said, âI go to Rome.â âto Rome!â the nobles cried. The nobles, Landgrave and Elizabeth, All cried with one loud voice to speed him on From the great doorway of the Hall, âTo Rome!â III THE PILGRIMAGE AND STAFF Now full of hope and deep repentance too, Tannhauser hastened on his pilgrimage To Rome. The road was long and rough and full Of weariness, with none to aid him save His staff. But his own deep remorse, also His reborn faith in God, his reverent love Now for Elizabeth made easy all the way. When other pilgrims through the meadows went And sought the gentle paths, he turned aside To bruise his feet in thorns and stony ways. The wayside streams he passed and bore his thirst. In silence and contrition pressing on, He filled his mind with hope and noble thoughts Of future deeds and life all free from sin. At last when many days were passed he came To Rome. The bells were pealing forth in joy, And anthems filled the air in promise of The pardons for the weary pilgrim band, As one by one they sought the presence of the Pope And from him found the full assurance of Forgiveness for their sins. Then came at last Tannhauser's turn. In deep repentance now He humbly knelt and told of all his sin: The Venusburg, its dark and evil spells, His wasted year, his fearful seizure in The minstrel hall. For mercy now he begged The Pope, and from enchantment to be freed. But sternly spoke his papal lord, âIf you Have been into the Venusburg, and there Enchanted by its magic powers and spells, You will succumb again, and you may hope For God's forgiveness when my staff puts forth Green leaves.â Struck dumb with grief and deep despair Tannhauser staggered forth. In hopelessness He fell upon the ground and wished for death. At last when he arose, the pilgrim band Had passed its way toward home, and from afar Its chorus of thanksgiving faintly reached His ears. Tannhauser took his staff, alone To wander on he knew not where, bereft Of consolation, and of hope and love. And far, far away in secret prayed Elizabeth in agonizing love To God that He might save Tannhauser's soul, And bring him back to her from magic powers Redeemed. The year passed on and bringing near The time the pilgrims must return from Rome. Elizabeth more anxious grew; there spread Upon her face a greater sign of fear And growing sadness, which Von Eschenbach Was quick to see. He sought to comfort her With gentle words, and unobtrusive love, And ever watchful care. Elizabeth Was grateful for his deep solicitude And love, but could not give him love for love. Thus, day by day, down to the Virgin's shrine, Where passed the pilgrims on their road from Rome, She came to pray, until one day there came Upon the wind the echo of a song Which she well knew. âIt is their song,â she cried With heart half bursting with its hope and fear, Its pent-up agony and love. She strained Her eyes to see the coming pilgrim band, And of the band the pilgrim whom she loved. Still onward came the pilgrims as they sang Triumphantly of GodâHis mighty love, And His forgiveness of their sins. And they, Unseeing, passed her by while she saw them, But saw not with them that dear pilgrim face She sought. âNo more will he return,â she said, And, with the wound of death upon her face, She sought the palace hall to wait and die. For die she must, she knew, without his love. To see his face no more; to hear his voice No more; was more than she could bear and live. A few more days were passed so quietly None in the palace thought Elizabeth Was near the end of life, or that her grief And love were yet so great that she must die. They thought her youth would yet assert itself And time would bring a solace to her love, And heal her broken heart. But scarcely was The sun up from the glowing East when she One morning called the Landgrave to her bed, And all the household dear, and bade tham all, A last farewell. And while they wept for her She closed her eyes and died. So gently did She pass she seemed as one who slept. And then Elizabeth was laid to rest With swelling music, and with holy mass, And gorgeous obsequies becoming to Her princely race and noble line of kings. Wolfram von Eschenbach stood on a hill One day above the shrine more sacred now To him because in prayer Elizabeth Had knelt so often there. The twilight hour Came on and brightly shone the evening star, And as he watched he felt as if it were The shining spirit of Elizabeth. He struck his harp and softly sang a song In which he made the lovely evening star In its soft radiance to symbolize Elizabeth in purity and love. And, while he sang, he saw in ragged garb A pilgrim leaning hard upon his staff As he approached, and on his haggard face The marks of deep despair and hopelessness. And when the pilgrim spoke he recognized Tannhauser, whom he kindly welcomed home. âTell me the story of your pilgrimage,â He said. Briefly Tannhauser told him all, And said, âWhen I have seen Elizabeth Once more, I leave this valley never to Return again.â âAlas,â Von Wolfram said, âElizabeth is dead. She died for you. In daily prayer for you and faithful love, She pined her life away, and now a saint In heaven she pleads with everlasting love For you.â Tannhauser fell upon the earth With grief too much to bear. And while he lay, Behold, swift messengers came from the Pope And bore aloft the papal staff and sang Of a great marvel wrought by God, for now The staff put forth green leaves in token of Tannhauser's full redemption from his sins. The evening star in gentle radiance Shone down upon the pilgrim's face at last Reposing in the calm and peace of death.</field>
