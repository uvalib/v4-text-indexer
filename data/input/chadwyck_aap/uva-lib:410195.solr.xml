      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. It is, I believe, customary to dedicate one's work to a patron. I suppose one's friend might with as much grave bear the burden. When I remember the enthusiasm with which my friend always espouses my cause, and how tenaciously she clings to the few virtues I have, and how blind she is to my innumerable faults, I have no forbodings of evil when I approach her. To her, Aurelia W. Beadle, the wife of my youth, this poor memento of my faith is sincerely inscribed by The Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Some years ago I was wandering about the waste places, thoroughfares and by-ways of a beautiful country âWhere the cypress and myrtle, Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime; Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime;â and, as I was passing, I wrote a few simple sketches of the things that impressed me. This land is commonly known as the Sunny South and is sometimes called âDixie;â for this reason I call them Sketches from Life in Dixie. Night before last I bundled them together, and sat down to admire the children of my fancy. No mother ever hung over the cradle of her first born with such delight as I did over them. For once these sketches had an audience; the universe was my theatre and my imagination filled it to the outer limits with eager listeners. I sat reading to them, far into the wee sma' hours of the night, till the absence of applause brought me to my senses, and I stopped to hear the clock on the stroke of two. About this time Benjamin Beaumont came into my room, slapped me playfully on the shoulder, and said, âSol, why don't you bring this thing to an end? Write a preface and an advertisement for your book, publish it, and put it on the market. There are some good things in it.â This disposed of my fancy; and brought me, for the first time in my life, down to real thought, for if there is anything that requires thought it is the preface of a book. You may tip the pinions of your fancy with fiction, and let it flit aimlessly about the inner pages of your book if you will; but when it comes to writing the last page of it, and tacking it to the front, and calling it a preface, I should like to see you escape the thoughts of the critic. This thought murdered my fancy, and my audience vanishedâonly three of us remained, the Reviewer, the Critic, and I. For us a short preface will do; in short, since I come to think of it, the writing of the thing is a waste of energy; so I will put it off till another time and content myself with telling the simple truth, Sketches from Life in Dixie is but the work of a novice. He wrote them for amusement; and publishes them at the solicitation of his friend Benjamin Beaumont. If they are accepted by that vaccillating thing known as Public Opinion, he will be thankful: if they are spurned by it, he will not complain, for the cranky old thing is whimsical anyhow. With patience I await the end, and subscribe myself Yours truly, S. A. Beadle. Jackson, Miss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IMPROMPTU. Many and many a year ago I heard of those ancient rhymers, Those builders of our poetic lore, The grand old vanished timers, Were always born and never made; That they by inspiration bade The eulogies and melodies From the spirit's emotions rise, Filling the earth, the air, the skies With beings from their paradise, Of esthetic thought and rapture. Then the muses chased the poets down From infancy to hoariness, With the genius' proffered crown And surprised them in their idleness With the coronation brilliancy Of sweet poetic ecstacy, When the metrical song moved along In melody's natural measure. A radient royal pleasure, Which the favored took at leisure Without the minutest effort. That this is true I sometimes feel, And write a feeble line or two, Whene'er the muses o'er me steal And I fain would strike the lyre too: But that âalways born, never made,â From the fanciful flight have stayed, Brilliant spondee and sweet touchee, Awaiting the inspiring tole, To move the music of my soul To the cadence of the poet's role, Of proficiency without toil. No, Nature has no favored ones, All are what themselves would be; Through endless toil Ambition's sons Adorn themselves with victory: So I will write it, right or wrong, Everyone shall hear the song, I wish to sing of Evylin; The chaste and lovely Evylin, Tho' all the measure set therein Is not what it should have been, To make the Criticaster's poem. MARY JANE'S BRIGHT EYE. Oft in the hush of twilight, When the golden sunbeams die, There beams for me the light Of Mary Jane's bright eye: As she swings, And sings, And lingers late, For me at the cottage gate. Whenever the day goes wrong With the weight of cruel cares, The lustre of her orbs Beam brighter though in tears, As she weeps And sweeps, And watches late My coming through the cottage gate. Oh! the eyes of my Mary Jane! Dark and sparkling, lovely eyes, Where stood my reflected self Mirrored in paradise, As she hung, And swung, And lingered late, And kissed me o'er the cottage gate. SONNETS TO MY LOVE. I I stood, when life was full of buoyant hope, At sunrise, in the vanished years now flown, With my mother, on that piece of earth that's known To those who've had mother's affections ope The gate, and leave ajar, to their full scope, The delightful ways of sweet childhood's home, And felt her hand of blessing on her ownâ And now when fancy calls up those remote Times, though its far too late, I appreciate Her sole absorbing theme, maternal love; Alone on this, the greatest human trait, God has written in the archives above Divine; but she left me disconsolate, Alone in oblivion's sphere to move. II I turn away from this scene of sadness, To embrace thee, fairest of all the earth, Thou thrillest me and all my friends with mirth And incitest hope that counsels cheerfulness, And bidst me to no longer doubt; nor guess At the supremacy of thyself and worth, Nor longer to compare thee with the serf; Life's meaner beings and their littleness. Thou art celestial, fair sweetheart of mine, Divinely fashioned in thine every part, The light that dazzles in those eyes of thine, Has won until now my unconquered heart; I kneel, divested of self, at love's shrine And offer thee all my confiding heart. III It is thine for good, for better, or for worse, Faithful to remain through all the year Of checkered life's bright sunshine, cloud and tear, Thine whatever be thy sad reverse, Thine till the collapse of the universe; Thine to revere, to love, adore, to wear Thine image on my soul; nor fate, nor fear, Weal nor woe, nor Mammon's power coerce Me into cold forgetfulness of thee, Because thou still livest alone for me And stern, cold, destructive adversity, Has left thee goddess of prosperity, To inspire me. Today, o'er life's grim sea, I hear the glad acclaim of victory. IV It's sweet to hear the milkmaid's rural song Floating in its melody on the wind; The buoyant echo of a tranquil mind; And sweeter still to see the waving corn, Falling beneath the scythe throughout the long Harvest days; and yet still more so to find The frugal meal spread by the angel kind, Which God gave to be our helpmate. The horn Of plenty thrives in her delicate hand, And economy fills our humble board. It is sweet as you tread a foreign strand, Where the ships from over the sea stand moored; To learn anew that in your native land, Confiding lovers your memories hoard. V It is sweet to have narrated at night The travels of him who has seen the earth, When hoary winter makes of all a dearth, And the fires of peace in our homes burn bright As we mix our wines and our friendships plight, O'er the bright nectar that kindles the mirth, Of the jolly souls that surround our hearth With their witty convivial delight. But sweeter, sweeter far, than all of these, Are the delicious joys young lovers steal, While making love beneath the verdant trees, As they feel the full, wild, passionate weal Of first love's grand emotions; when the breeze Of mutual hope fans the fire they feel. VI But this to me is the sweetest by night, With my love's soft voice as the complement, Chiming the cadence of its merriment, While her heart's at ease, and her spirit bright, Allures the soul in its ecstatic flight, To the fullest extent of its sentient, Passionately, bewildered sentiment, Of love's profound, affectionate delight. To feel the touch of this angelic one, In the sublime grace of her fellowship; Makes the heart beat quick and the spirit run, Pregnant with great bliss, into Cupid's ship O'er oceans of doubt, to love's dominion, As on her upturned face I press my lip. VII And when under the weight of cares for me, In affection's bower thou seekst repose, I will gather the myrtle, lilly and rose, To embellish thy resting place for thee. For chastity's reclining couch should be A sacred shrine, where the gallant daily goes, A self-made vassal, chief of love's heroes Felling the vicious tongue of calumny. When all the means at my command are spent, Whereof I might make thy sleep softly flow Through sunny dreams, I'll cease to serve, and print A kiss, love's epilogue, on thy sweet brow, Explanatory of our merriment, And resign thee to slumbers light and low. VIII Again the long and sombre shadows throw Their spectre forms across the dreary road; And their grim quiverings plainly forebode A crisis, and the golden sun, although Fading, has still a rich and brilliant glow, And his brow of burnished gold throws a robe Of crimson o'er all; as the grim old ford Between the night and the day he leaps o'er. When tired day slowly succumbs to twilight, Whose silent curtain, dropping, hides the way From view, and we see cold, dark, gloomy night In triumph succeed the beautiful day, Until the moon and stars, illumed and bright, Have martialed themselves in the Milky Way. IX Now the beauties of the sun's after glow Are reflected in yon dazzling arcade, As legions of stars after stars promenade Down the aisles of the firmament, and throw The glory of their unique order o'er All; there each in its special orbit stayed, By the rules of harmony which pervade The universe, has beings of its own, Who looking off on this world of ours, call It, perchance, a star, as on in its way It goes around the Prince of day, a ball Of ordinate matter, till ev'ry ray Of the spheres roll in files astronomical, While in the east the laughing sunbeams play. X Sleep, thou art a workman of skill and art, The master builder that turneth the arch Of beauty in feminine form; monarch Of nature's stupendous being and heart, That fills creation to its utmost part, With energy for its triumphant march, O'er the blighting forces of death that parch The soul of beauty; aye, the stricken heart Beats stronger after calm repose with thee, And death is foiled in its triumphant hour, And marks but a point in our destiny, Where the watch fires burn dimly in life's tower But will blaze with renewed vitality, Reignited by thy silent power. XI For what is death but calm repose after all? Sleep, lovely sleep, that finds vitality; Behold! it springs from seed of plant and tree, A living fact, the grave cannot enthrall, Nor annihilation again recallâ Demonstrated resurrection to me, Immortal life, man's final destiny; By nature's vital forces ever called To action somewhere in the universe, After the pause for refreshment and rest, In that realm where the omnivorous nurse Men call the grave, enfolds all to its breast, Whose stern immutable powers coerce And all the living maketh a jest. XII Blessed is the man who enters sleep's domain Of tranquility and majestic ease; Where refreshing slumbers the weak appease, And with beauty reanimate the inane; Where calumny's shaft and intended pain Are vanished never to return again; Where society's distinctions release Their hold, and casteâthat civil diseaseâ Which has destroyed states and wrecked empires, Is perpetually barred; there the old Consuming blight of poverty expires, And of mute inactivity grows cold; When peaceful repose quiets the desires, And sleep, majestic sleep, fills the household. XIII Come thou, lord of labor, come. I propose To ally myself with thee, and to have, Thy powerful hands close these eyes, and pave My way to forgetfulness and repose; Teach me how soon forgot are all the woes, The joys, the triumphs; and all that men crave Or hope for, love or abhor, when the grave, Ante room to eternity, shall close All the realities of earth to me. Sweet refreshing slumber, come, my royal Master, come thou, and let me embrace thee. Oh! come thou, and strengthen me for the toil Of another day; and of eternity Give me a view, ere my ashes have turned to soil. XIV Sweet the morning after repose with thee, When the firmament turns from gray to gold And the radiant starlit sky has rolled Into the archives of day's immensity, And thou awake, seeming fresh from Deity's Hands come, and we from love's eyes will behold The first born of all the spheres arise, bold And fearless in his supreme sovereignty O'er all aerial things; but to you, Last and fairest from the hand of God, He comes on golden wings, a servant true, Alone illuminating thy abode; There he is at last up the eastern view, And only for thee creation's beauties hoard. XV Sweep on in thine aerial flight, O sun, Like shadows old chaos fled before thee, When thou swung out there over land and sea, The hub of the solar system to run The universe; then the morning stars sung Together while thou set the spheres aglee, And fixed the measures of their destiny When old time's calendar began to run. But who can fix the measure of thy years, Or tell when they shall end, as they surely will, For 'tis said thyself shall die, and the spheres Shall forget their concord and instill In old chaos a new hope; but it appears It shall not triumph when thou art still. XVI Then Jehovah's supremest attribute Will light the diamond boulevards of the sky, And angels of peace and light will fly, On errands of love for thee, and salute Us with shouts of welcome, which will confute The fears our carnal bodies raised, led by The prince of night; that father of the lie Which once made us hesitate, and commute The priceless favor of Messiah for him. But now we see His love in the pathless wood, In rippling stream, and eolian hymn, In the embellished lea where Flora stood And sowed the flowers in the early spring, And left the spirit of her sisterhood. XVII Who is the queen of my fancy? Well, My friend would you really like to know? She is not yellow, white nor gray, and so Must be something else. I'm afraid to tell, Since all that's mean between heaven and hell, Abhor the color black. She's cherub, though, And all the fair and the impartial know, She is a beautiful, beautiful angel. I care not what your prejudice, you'll love Her in your heart, when the light of her dark eyes Beam on you, like the flash of stars above A dark and rolling cloud; her form complies With all the art the Grecian sculptors prove; âHer voice?â A chord escaped from paradise. MY WISH. As I strive to lift the burden, When intense becomes the strife, If you are friendly, brother, While the tumult is rife, Is the time above all others, For the helping hand in life. And when I am growing weary, Victory seems in doubt, Then come to my rescue, brother, With praises loud speak out, Do not wait till I have conquered, To raise the cheering shout. If the fight is drawn, my brother, I neither lose nor win, Will you keep your place beside me, Till I try it again, Till I mend my broken armor, And try my hand again? If the battle goes against me, I'm smitten hip and thigh, It is then and there, my brother, I'd like to have you nigh, With your valor and your courage, And not your sympathy. And when I'm done, my brother, When my final word is said, When I sleep beneath the grasses Where the daisy lifts its head, In the place of polished marble Plant the roses instead. You may leave me off your praises, When they make my humble bed, In the silent land of shadows With the green sod over headâ If I am forgot while living, Forget me when I'm dead. Just leave me to the memory Of him I used to know, Of the friend who stood beside me So many years ago, When you were quoting calumny And I was plucking crow. I CARE NOT FOR THE MISER'S GOLD. I care not for the miser's gold, Nor increased acreage of lands; My neighbor's goods I would not hold Nor wring wealth from his clinched hands. Oh no! My God! I would not have My hands itching for his gold, A higher boon my spirit craves Of Thee. Let me communion hold With these: the good, the great, the free; Aye! let me scale the towering dome Of thought, and feel, and know, and see The highest dome bidding welcome To my continued upward flight; Oh, grant that I may stand amid Men of thought, a man; banish night From my clouded brow, and me rid Of my mental infirmities. Thou Deity of Deities! CASTLE BUILDERS. Many and many a merry day, Under the oak tree's shade, We children tripped it out to play, Happy, blithe and gay; Then we built our airy castles high, To occupyâah when? When we were grown to men, Those beautiful, airy castles high, When we were grown to men. Or down the lane we chased the fly, That brilliant, gauzy thing, Which seemed a sunbeam floating by, Blithe and gay as we, When we built those airy castles high, To occupyâah when? When we were grown to men, Those beautiful, airy castles high, When we were grown to men. Alas! the golden years have flown; Also the blithe and gay; But hope's phantoms flit the gloam Just the same today; And we build our airy castles high, To occupy them when We unite the schemes of menâ You beautiful, airy castles high, We'll occupy you then. And soar again on fancy's wings, Chasing the rainbows down; Those radiant and dazzling things, The visionary schemes of men; And build our castles somewhat worse, Than in the years gone by; For we shall occupy them when We learn to know man is a farce, And his promise is a lie. THE PYRAMID. The pyramid through ages past, Through all their tempest, storm and blast, Held its apex up to grasp The elements. Three thousand years, long and fleet, Have struck their colors at its feet, Ten thousand more its strength shall meet Till time is done. Where is the tower Babel built? Where is Tyre's crimson hilt? Judea's temple. and the guilt Her neighbors' knew? They're gone at oblivion's callâ Old Egypt's skill survives them allâ Yet in the art of Pharaoh's pall The Egyptian lives. JOE'S FARM. Many aud many a year has gone Since I was cleared by Joe, Who plowed me up and planted corn, To see it shoot and grow. He built an old Virginia fence Out there where the wires run; And worked, he said, in self-defense, From sunny sun to sun. He planted peas between the rows, And pumpkins here and there; And where that patch of briar grows He set out deep the pear. And further on the apple tree, And the peach orchard there; With worthy pride embellished me With fruit trees ev'rywhere. And placed around the orchard, sir, Were hives and hives of bees; In the piggery the hogs were; In the pasture, the beeves. And fiery steeds, and all that go To make your farm a home; But that which was most prized by Joe Was his broad fertile loam. He kept me fertilized and tiled, With ditches deep and wide, And never let the floods run wild, Nor stream it down my side. And where the gullies would have been, Near by he planted trees; Then there the grass grew bright and green, And there would play the breeze. But Joe has long since passed away, And others master here; Yet since that sad and gloomy day I've lordless been and drear. And where was once the verdant knoll, Gullies are yawning wide; And when it rains the waters roll In torrents down my side. Here in the flats the briars grow, The thistles on the hills; And where the gin wheels used to go Are a few rotten sills. The gentleman that's master now Says farming does not pay; He neither drives nor holds the plow, And values not his clay. When the master of this place was Joe And cotton king of crops, I've seen the white and red blooms blow On miles of my sunny tops. And in the fall the fleecy stuff Would fill the earth like snow, The harvesters would cry enough, And farming it paid Joe. AFTER CHURCH. Yes, May and I are friends, Lovers, many have said; For down the lane and o'er the lea To church we often tread, In that careless sort of way, That leads to love, they say; And after church we often search For garlands by the way. Yes, May and I are friends, And something more, they say; Because along the curved strand, Where we sat the other day, I simply wrote her name, And wrote it o'er again; When after church we stopped to search For shells along the main. More than friends are we, My bonny May and I; At least that's what our neighbors say Whene'er they pass us by, They smile and wink their eye, And set their necks awry: When after church we stop to search For heart's ease, May and I. WORDS. Words are but leaves to the tree of mind; Where breezy fancy plays; Or echoes from the souls which find Expression's subtle ways. A beaming lamp to idea's feet Where sentinel thought abides; Or a guide to the soul's retreat, Where master man presides. A jewel trembling on the tongue, The index of the heart; The black mask from the spirit wrung. Revealing every part. A ship upon the sea of life, With all her sails aswell; Her cargo being the bread of life, Or the cindered dross of hell. LINES ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND. Life is a mysterious thing. It comes we know not whence, And leaves us on a rapid wing For an absence immense. Just yester morn I had a friend, Cheerful, brilliant and gay; Today grim Death announced his end, And bore him hence away. Away into that dark region, From kindred, friend and foe, To join the numberless legion Of men who went before. Who, now, will cheer the broken hearted, Or shield them from Death's wrath, Since the strong, the brave, has departed, And left a corpse in the path? He was adorned with honor's star, Had conquered all but fate; Death's wing became his palace car And bore him to heaven's gate. Sleep on, dear friend; thou art not dead; Much labor bids thee rest Profoundly in thy narrow bed, Of mother earth the guest. The good, the great in eminence, The famous, and the proud, Shall join thee, shorn of this pretense, Clothed only with a shroud. Ambition, pride and hope may rise Towering up Fame's dazzling peaks; Yet they but find in glory's skies The bier where valor sleeps. TO THE DAISY. No, the cold damp earth could not restrain thee, Nor the bleak north winds retard thy coming; For first on the green where the lambs are running, And down where the rushing brooklet doth flee, In its musical cadence on to the sea, Thy sweet face has been modestly turning Its delicate features up to the sunning, And throwing its fragrance over the lea, In a wild and most exuberant way. Oh, I love thee, wee blue eyed daisy fair! And I wish thou might blow out there for aye. Filled with loveliness, perfuming the air, And alluring me from the broad highway, To gather garlands for my lady fair. Thou sit'st upon the meadow's lap of green, Like smiles upon the face of a sleeping babe, And the zephyrs sighing through the everglade, Waft thy perfumes to the winding stream That lies at thy feet a beautiful sheen; By the skill of the Master cunningly made, To catch the likeness of my dark eyed maid As she gathers her garlands there, I ween; Thy Circean beauty bewilders me, For truly, I am curious to know Why the most delicate flowers that be, Upon lawn, heather and bough, should first blow, Fairest and sweetest in their modesty, Of all the beautiful flowers that grow. THE FATE OF ALL. They'll bring when we are dead, perchance, Some flowers from their garden, friend; And place them where Time's cruel lance Has marked for us, for all, the end. They'll drop upon our bier a tear, And close for us our eyes; and then They will leave us forgotten here, Till time has run its course with men. If thought of us survives a day, A month, a year or century, Still we shall be forgot for aye; For time consumes all memory. If Love should rear her shaft of stone, To mark our little mound of dust, The granitic fate too well is knownâ It shall decay to mould with us. A few brief years may yet remain To us on this delightful shore, Then in the silent land's domain We shall rest in peace forevermore. The generations yet to come, Creation's vast immensity, Shall find with us a common home, For commonage's our destiny. The vast expanse of all the deep Shall one day pause and cease to roll; The liquid grave where millions sleep Shall itself give up its soul. When oblivion reigns supreme, Down the endless aisles of chaos, All things become alike gangrene, In the land where spirit leaves us. TO A JILT. Why did you not tell me your heart is stone, Where hope, nor joy, nor pleasures abide; At whose granite base lies broken my own, Shorn of its faith and bereft of its pride? Yes, I recall, you said something of this, But the light of your eye, the smile of your face, Led me to confide in the promised bliss You taught me to seek of your assumed grace. And I dreamed not that one with features so fair, And a form which truly the angels envy, Could weave so well the treacherous snare Of vice, and pride, and perjured frenzy. Fare thee well! Satanic creature, adieu! Think no more of him who now tries to wean His soul from squandering his all on youâ Thou false in friendship, in wedlock a fiend! LINES. Suggested by the Assaults made on the Negro Soldiers as they passed through the south on their way to and from our war with Spain. How I love my country you have heard, And I would you were noble and free In spirit and deed, as in word, And your boasted humanity. I love you, my country, I do,â Here's a heart, a soul that is thine, Pregnant with devotion for you, And blind to your faults as to mine. The standard of morals is high; When fixed by my brother for me, It goes towering up to the sky With a dazzling purity. For a bench he sits on a skull, And is a judge austere and stern, With whom my demurrers are null, And my pleadings, though just, are spurned. I've carried your flag to the front Through pestilence, battles and storms; Of the carnage of war took the blunt, Obeyed your command, âCarry arms!â And gone with you down to the death, With the thorns of caste on my head; Defended your home and your hearth, And wept o'er the bier of your dead. As the smoke of the fight goes by, And the bugle calls to repose, By my countryman's hands I die, As well as by the hands of its foes; Yet I love you, my country, I do, Here's a heart, a soul that is thine, Pregnant with devotion for you, And blind to your faults as to mine. MY LIST OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS. A list of my beautiful things?â Well, have you seen my Evylin; The beautiful, beautiful Evylin? She's my list of beautiful things. A world of beautiful things is she, Grand! chaste! personified Love she stands in purity's pride And thinks of me, and thinks of me. Poems of ethical thought is she, Divinely sung on every page; All her womanly heart engaged With love of me, with love of me. My list of beautiful things, None were ever so sublimely grand, To her I give my heart and hand, And all the wealth my labor brings. A MESSAGE FOR JANETT. Far away where the raging sea goes, In the islands of the sea, There our brave and daring heroes Fought the battles of the free; From the hands of arrogant Spain Struck the sword of tyranny, On the plains of El Caney. But o'er the halo of our glory Falls the mem'ry of our brave, Stalwart men, all maimed and gory, Sleeping in a foreign grave, Where the grim Spanish armament, And her gallant men of war, Threw death's missiles wide and far. There among the dead and dying Lay a victim of their rage, By a Spanish block house lying, Amid the battle's carnage. He yields to death while glory weeps; But conquers its agony, And recks not of its misery. Now his mind on fancy's pinion Wings its flight to friends and home, Takes its leave of war's dominion, Flutters down the vista gloam; Till again his friends and loved ones Shout their welcome in his ear, O'er his comrade's martial cheer. But his end came nearer, nearer; Yet he raised his manly head, And in language somewhat clearer Called his comrade near, and said, âComrade, if you should live it through Tell them how we met the Don, Fought for human rights and won; âStrove to place our standard higher On the ramparts of the free, Defied the Spaniard's deadly fire And died for humanity; Tell them of our negro heroes, Of the valiant black brigade, And the gallant charge it made. âYou remember there's another, Dearer far than all to meâ Comrade, don't forget my mother, For she is all expectancy. Tell her that I met death bravely, With the red sod for a bed, And âOld Gloryâ over head. âYou will find her by the hearthstone Near the northern Mexic coastâ Dreaming that I'm coming home, And the Spaniard's cause is lost.â âWhat answer shall you make to her?â Tell her that she lost a son, But the day was nobly won. âThen you'll take a message for me To Janett, across the main; There she's bravely waiting for me, But we'll never meet again On that undulating landscape, Rolling onward, copse and lea, In their rustic purity. âWhere a laughing, rippling streamlet, Playing with the golden sands, Loiters by the peaceful hamlet, Winds along the fallow lands, Through a green and varied landscape, There Janett awaits for me, In a cottage near the sea. âIn a garden, sweetly laden With the roses newly blown, There the comely, gracious maiden Stands before her cottage home; Now she moves across the landscape Through the copse and o'er the lea. See! she comes to welcome me! âYou will know her by her lashes, Fringing eyes as dark as jet; And her curly raven tressesâ You can't miss my fair Janett, With her beautiful curved neck, And the rare angelic grace Of her motion, form and face.â Here his voice grew faint and broken, But his face with rapture shone, As he held aloft the token Which he through the fight had borne; 'Twas our old and riven ensign, That his clotted blood did blurâ This the message sent to her. MY SUBURBAN GIRL. I know a sweet suburban girl, She's witty, bright and brief; With dimples in her cheeks; and pearl In rubies set, for teeth. Beneath her glossy raven hair There beams the hazel eye, Bright as the star of evening there Where the yellow sunbeams die. Her breath is like a flower blown, In fragrance and perfume; Her voice seems from the blissful throne Where their harps the angels tune. Her waist is just a trifle more Than a cubit in its girth; But when there my arms I throw, I've all there is of earth. And when she turns her dimpled cheek Toward me for a kiss, I lose expressionâcannot speakâ And take all there is of bliss. THE SOUTHERN GIRL. The fairest thing on land or sea Is the Southern girl, to me. You should see her when the stars Come studding all the sky; And feel her beaming eye On you when the moon is fullâ Fairest of all that's fair is she, The Southern girl, to me. You should hear her laugh by night, In the moonlight clear and bright, When the zephyrs light and low, Across the gardens steal, To play with the Marechal-Neil, And caress the beautiful girlâ Fairest of all that's fair is she, The Southern girl, to me. Beneath the Marechal-Neil by night, In the hush of the dead twilight, You should meet the Southern girl; And hear the angel sing, The bonny angel sing; And feast on wit, and joy, and loveâ Fairest of all that's fair is she, The Southern girl, to me. The vocal enwoven beauty Of her graces ever cheers me, As I listen to the cadence Of her metrical airs, Whene'er she trills and dares Some melodious chord to makeâ Fairest of all that's fair is she, The Southern girl, to me. After the wooing and merry days, Go with her through her toiling ways, As mother, and wife, and friend; Learn the iron will, The courage and the skill Of the typical Southern girlâ Fairest of all that's fair is she, The Southern girl, to me. ELLA'S DANCE. Come, tripping, tripping, tripping, oh, On the light fantastic toe; And we'll tread the royal measure, Down the aisles of wit and pleasure, Gilding softly, sweetly so, On the nimble, nimble toe. Come, lightly, lightly, lightly, oh! Press me softly as we go, Playfully skipping to and fro, As round, and round we reel and go, Gliding softly, sweetly so, On the nimble, nimble toe. FLORA. I sought her in the woodland Where the dogwood blossoms blow, And thought I had her cornered Where the little rill doth flow, Laughs and sings, laughs and sings, Sweeping over golden sands, Like a living thing On burnished silver wings. But the cunning elf escaped me, And left me standing there, Bewildered by the cadence Of her music in the air; In the air, in the air The poesy of nature, Struck by the feathered tribe, Ran lyrical ev'rywhere. Till fancy caught her smiling In the budding of the trees, Where tiny little leaflets Unfolded to the breeze, To the breeze, to the breeze, When Flora came a-riding A sunbeam for a steed, Down the floral highways of the leas. And the cunning elf flew onward, With magical little wand Painting up the butter cups Beside her as she ran, As she ran, as she ran; Till her prancing steed stood still Entangled in the snare On my lady's cheeks of tan. You cunning little elfin, I have sought you ev'rywhere To find you 'neath the tresses Of a girl's disheveled hair; Lady fair, graced and rare. When you stoop to plant the rose You but set its colors In your cheeks, my lady fair. NANNIE IS A BONNIE MAID. Nannie, she is dearer far Than all the girls I know, For when the cook deserts her ma And swears she'll work no more, She puts her latest music by And bakes an apple pie. Nannie is a bonnie maid, There's none so neat and fair, As she when dressed in Wesson plaid, And banged her glossy hair, With all her silken skirts put by, While she serves the apple pie. MY PRAYER. My Savior, in life's ebb and flow, In its turmoil, in its glow, In its triumph, in its woe, Through its changes guard Thou me. I am weak and poor and blind, And oft in my weakness I find Vile sin has stol'n my peace of mind. And driven me, Oh Lord, from Thee. Eternal One, hide not Thy face, But grant me mercy, love and grace, And in Thy providence a place Of security and rest. I know Thou art rich without me, That one, God, the Spirit and Thee, Is th' eternal Deity; And angels are Thy worshipers. In Thy hands love and justice dwell, And the hosts of light, earth and hell Obedient to Thy will must swell The long roll at the judgment call. Lord, I know when the bleeding heart Looks up to Thee, Thou wilt impart Upon each ruptured broken part The soothing balm of Thy sweet love. And when estranged are all earth's friends And the gloom of rejection still tends To obstruct my way, Thou wilt send Me Thy comforter from above. And if fortune at last should beam Upon my obscure path, a gleam Of sunshine from Thy upper realm, I know the sunshine, Lord, is Thine. Lord, I would learn to love mankind, Through love of him a passage find To a rich and bright and purer mind, And home and rest at last with Thee. BIOGRAPHIA. I saw sweep out of the unknown A worthy sunlit bark, alone, By eddies dallied and then thrown Down with Life's stream. And on its frail though radiant prow, âConsigned to the unknown art thou,â Was stamped by Him, Who then, as now, Directs the end. There went with it a being of hopeâ A radiant being of hope, An ethereal philanthrope, Somewhat divine. She steered the craft hard by the shoreâ I heard the stroke of her golden oar, The silver thread of the streamlet o'er Throwing the spray. Her cargo was of jewels rare, All luminous, splendid and fair; The ensign of a prince was there Undoubtedly. Methinks I saw his armor there, Brilliantly grand, superb and rare, Whose shield was beaming ev'rywhere, Like a coronet. And through the helmet of his robe Two luminous orbs lit his abode, And like the fixed stars brightly glowed Continuously. And near this dazzling light appears A blazing meteor beneath the spheres, Expression's guide of joy and fears Incased in pearl. This pearly armament's support Is cunningly built, a coral fort Compassed with ruby fleets, which float 'Round there for aye. And when its florid portals oped, The cadence of the prince awoke The music Mother Eve evoked In Paradise. Then the stream, grand, masterly stream, Moved swiftly, silent and serene, The bark and its fair guide between, To run the falls. But still she, with her skillful hand, E'er taught the tottering craft to stand The strain and shock of the rocky strand Which lies below. Where the stream runs its merry race Of rapid, smooth and subtile grace, The craft leaped o'er the falls, to face The surge and whirl, Of the deep, the grand and awful wave, Where the frothy waters toil and rave On in their course, as they engrave Their history. And bickers on by sunlit hills, Where Vanity Fair the passion fills, And pompous pride in the breast instills A new desire. Then out, and 'round the slippery curve Where bold Maturity's heights subserve The channel to deepen, and to swerve Its rapid flight. Then down the rugged precipice, Through the whirling pools of Error's bliss, Where the troubled waters seethe and hiss A flood of tears. Here, where youth's border land appears, The gallant oarsman drops his fears, And, king-like, o'er the floods he rears His stately head. Then through green fields and sunny climes, Where Cupid's violin strikes the chimes Of melody's tunes and happy rhymes, The river runs. Till o'er its purling waters came The splash of golden oars again, Dashing the silver spray like rain From Cupid's prow. Where Evylin sat, an angel bright, A fair, celestial angel bright, Guiding another bark of light Through Love's domain; Where moon, and stars, and earth, and air Seemed covered with the mystic snare, Which Cupid throws to catch the fair Angelic thing, As she sweeps down the silver stream Beneath the glow of beauty's beam, With hope's, and love's, and fancy's gleam Of wild delight, Steering for that semi-paradise, To the land where experience lies, Where truth and wisdom harmonize Youth's fervent fires. Here many a green isle appears, Along the stream, where the sunny years, Of conjugal life devoutly wears Contentment's crown. Till the stream impetuous grows, And pride, deceitful pride, blows His clarion horn and goes About the sails, Of ev'ry ship which daily files, Adown the stream by the sunny isles; Where with them all fame flies and smiles Bewitchingly. Just flies and smiles; beguiles and tries To lead all 'neath the sunny skies, With windy inconsistencies Off the Isles of Peace. Till Ambition comes, an oarsman dark, A stern, deceptive oarsman dark, And takes possession of the bark, And rows blindly on. Where all the floods become untied And pour their torrents far and wide, From mountain side to mountain side, Through the dismal swamp. Ambition's meed, dark discontent, And Fame's worthless emolument, So often pledged, but seldom sent, Till this good day. Till the splendor of the old bark's glow, Which all well knew in that long ago, Is storm-driven so till we scarce know What 'tis or does. But I saw it with the billows toil, When the turbulent stream's rough turmoil Did its fair prospects taunt and foil, And roll grumbling on. Through bold tornadoes it had gone; I saw the rent where Calumny's storm, Swept through the sails and then hissed on Relentlessly. But the bark was a kingly one, It weathered the storms; I saw it run Grappling with the stream and overcome The vicious winds That stormed along the malignant strand, Just where looms up the goodly land Of Fame's domain and Fancy's grand Expectantcy. Again, I saw it sail, and sail, Proud and defiant with the gale, With hope, iron will, and nerves of mail Combatting the fates. Where the stream runs purling swift and strong In its murmuring, liquid song Breaking hope, and will, and nerves along The cataract. And still the craft sped with the wave. On the crest of the billows laved, Nor heeded the omnivorous grave That yawned below Where the river bold grew deep and wide; Till it so placidly seemed to glide, That its deceptive waves belied Its rapid flight. To the grand and deep old ocean wide, Rolling in all its majestic pride, Until the crest of its hoar tide The river met. There it eddied as if it would be still, And the oarsman, infirm and ill, Furled his sails, surrendered his will, And crossed his oars. For that ruby bulwark, strong and bold, And those luminous orbsânow coldâ Swing to and fro, a ruin old, Sacked at last by Time. Who stands Death's oceanic mien! However mute the winds, bright the sheen, Or peacefully lulled the marine Which decoys him? And if the zephyrs do play low, Light, soft and smooth the deep sea o'er They but waft the bark and its cargo Into port. AFTERWARD. I'm all alone in the world, now, My bonnie love has flown; My heart's an empty void, now, Where the wreck of joy is strown; For o'er her grave, the tombs between, The grass is growing green. I'm sad tonight! I did not know How dear she was to me; How fervent was her passion's glow, Her love's sincerity; Till o'er her grave, the tombs between, The grass was growing green. I would I could see her face again, That furrowed face of care, That I might woo away the pain My coldness chiseled there; And lie for her the tombs between, Where the grass is growing green. I somehow feel, since she has gone, That negligence is crime: That I am guilty of this wrong To my eyelids brings the brine: Since she lies cold the tombs between, Where the grass is growing green. AGE'S REJOINDER. I would not live always: I ask but to stayâ In this vain world of shadows Just another day; By that other day I mean Three score years and ten, Then, perhaps, I'll take my leave Willingly, of men. Yet, if it suits my Lord To lengthen the thread That tethers me to earth's shores, A few more years instead, Contentedly I'll plod onâ With my crutch and cane Bear the weight of four score years, And not complain. Live always? Of course not! But I'd like to see My span of years reeling down To the century. âWhat about my absent friends, And rheumatic foe?â I'll forget those, this endure, A year and a day more. LINES TO MR. ? Friend, must we part and part forever? The spell that bound our hearts is brokeâ Did I say âfriendâ? Excuse me,âbrother; I would the word I'd never spoke. And brother, too, I should forget, Since you the sacred tie would spurn T' indulge the passions which have met 'Round our friendship's broken urn. And yet it's hard and passing strange That one brief hour should sever us; And that a broken pledge should change Hearts for a thing so odious. But I had learned to trust you soâ Thought you so far above mankind, So noble, and so trueâwhen, lo! Deception's wand strikes you blind. Blind to all that we used to be, Blind to all that we ought to be, Blind still to yourself and meâ Blind even to vile treachery. But should fortune e'er desert you, Fate mark for you a rugged lot, For what you ought to be I'll serve you, And of your treachery think not. STRIKE FOR EQUAL RIGHTS. Think of the price of liberty, Think of the lash and slavery, Of lynch rule and its massacre And strike for equal rights. Say, must we longer trust the law, Class-enacted to hide the flaw Of the crimson hand that strikes to awe And terrorize us into slaves? Let him who trembles or has fears, When the cowardly mob appears, Receive a coward's meed and tears, Death and a piece of hemp. Where the American who would be A renegade to liberty; Because of fear would turn and flee, When duty calls him here. He should be yoked and bound for aye, As long as night succeeds the dayâ For liberty can only stay, The meed of valiant men. He who fears not the mob's alarm: To him who would the traitors storm, And fell them with a valiant arm, Behold a freeman's meed! Come the valiant, and come the brave, Come all except the abject slaveâ Let him fall in a bondman's graveâ And strike for liberty! Come all the law abiding, come, Where'er throughout the earth you roam, And strike for native land and home, For God and sacred life. WHILE THE WALTZ IS ON. Ere the banquet's over, love, And the stars are gone; Before the garlands wither, love, While the waltz is on, Whisper softly in my ear Love's melody, my dear. While the waltz is on, my dear, And the music's roll Echoes through the hall so clear, So happy makes the soul, As we reel and turn and whirl Say yes, my bonny girl. Ere the dance is done, sweetheart, Before the music dies, Make me glad, before we part, Complete my paradise; Just before the music's gone, And while the waltz is on. THE MUSIC OF THE RAIN. There's music in the rain, As on the roof it drops, And its monotonous tap, tap Beats on the window pane; Or murmuring it stops A moment on the dripping eaves. There's music in the rain When it falls the leaves among, And spatters in the viney nooks And sparkles on the grain; All earth has found a tongue, And its loud hallelujahs ring. Oh! the music of the rain, See it comes pouring down, Bright and joyous o'er field and plain, While its golden currents drain The smooth and verdured lawn, And then run bickering to the main. There's music in the rain, When all the winds arise, And livid lightning marks the path Of the dread hurricane; While in the clouded skies Old thunder beats the martial airs. There's music in the rain When all the winds are still, When lightning's flash and thunder's roll Are stilled and mute again; And you feel the heart's thrill When the storm cloud goes racking by. There's music in the rain When the clouds are clearing off, And sunny beams come struggling through The silver of the rain, Where hope's arch stands alof' In the reflux of the storms. IDA. She is a woman, bright and trim, Of five and twenty years, Who trips along with pleasure And spends her smiles for tears. Her hair retains its raven hue, Her sparkling eye its fire; But her heart is sad, discordant, A strung, but tuneless lyre. For she staked her all on conquest Of the voluptuous host, With society's devotees Bet high, played long and lost. She's wiser now than yesterday, At last she spurns the dream That women were made for pleasure, And men are what they seem. THE GOLDEN ROD. There is a calm and solemn air Along the road, by garden fair, By rushing stream, and ev'rywhere The sear and yellow leaf's aglow. The foliage is growing old; All through the verdure gleams the gold; The rose is turning into mold; But golden rod stands ev'rywhere. O'er the lea and across the mead, And far away where the cattle feed, There blows the yellow crested reed, The autumnal queen of flowers. Its golden crown along the way, Sways back and forth, and seems to say, âI am fair Flora's Queen today, And the wind's my messenger boy. âAnd further on the wind's low wail Proclaims my reign along the dale, Till the tired harvester drops his flail And hails me queen of the flowers.â YELLOW JACK OF '97. With a shudder still I remember The alarm of Yellow Jack: Sent out in the daily number, Of the âTimes-Democrat.â Also the âDaily Picayuneâ Made the dreaded tidings known; The paper venders caught the tune And heralded it around the town. âHere's your âDaily Picayune,ââ And âHere's your âTimes-Democrat!ââ âPaper, sir, âDaily Picayune,â All about the Yellow Jack!â âAt Ocean Springs and Scranton, sir, Biloxi and ev'rywhere Along the coastââPicayune,â sir? All about the fever there! âThere 'tis, sir! a catastrophe, Strikes our business interest square, And leaves us a wreck in mid sea, With fever and despair.â âIf it's fever, it's dengue, Or malaria from lack Of cleanliness, in a few Coast towns. It's not Yellow Jack,â Said all the doctors, looking wise. But the restless feeling grew, And all the people, with glaring eyes, And ashen lips, said âIt's true!â From the start business stopped, congealed, And strong men gathered the crowd About the public streets, to feel The business pulse, sigh aloud; And then to troop it out of town: For their fancy paints so well, Until it kinder brings them down, To unwholesome views of (?) Wellâ You understand; roasting scenes in that Sultry country where the swell Epidemic fiend, grim Yellow Jack, The conductor acts so well. You talk of being panic struck, Routed friend and all of that; You should see the bulletin stuck To the alarm of Yellow Jack. For yellow fever 'larms from press And newsboys, can clear the earth With inflated yells of distress In twenty minutes without death. And then the faithful few, who stand At duty's post; because They cannot escape, understand, Prohibitory laws. They quarantine the empty void With a mailed guard so well, That 'twould terrorize the alloid Visage of the host of Hell. Then gnaws the formidable thought, Quarantined away from home: This experience so dearly bought, So vividly paints our own: Till we see the ghost of all our hopes Floating down the yellow stream; Our empty homes along the copse And grim Yellow Jack between. And hear the stroke of the sturdy oar, The surge of the awful wave; As Yellow Jack trips our loved ones o'erâ The druggist into the grave. YOUTH'S HOME AND MOTHER. Down the long flight of years, With the fleet sweep of time, Our memory still bears On the one place sublime, Of all that earth holds of joy and of mirth, And that place, friend, is the place of our birth. The gay may dazzle the eye, For a time brightly blaze Then dimly burn and die; Then 'tis we fix and gaze On all that earth holds of joy and of mirth, Down the dim vista ways of long ago. Friendship may fail and fly Off by night and our joy, With the breath of morning die; Naught be ours but alloy, And all that earth holds of joy and of mirth, Youth's home and mother and her sterling worth Deep as is the ocean's brine, Love will trace her epitaph, Along the strand of time; Where stands the biograph Of all the nation's worth, its cares and mirth In mother's love, and faith, and works, and home. These will blaze, burn and glow Until the end of time; Till again we meet, and know Our parting was sublime! Till we meet and know, where the ransomed go, Up the endless aisles of paradise. INNOCENCE ASLEEP. A fair dark-eyed lassie was she, Her thirteenth summer passed, Who pursuing blue-eyed daisy, Herself had over-tasked; And fell asleep in the meadow, Where the wildest flowers blow. I read the dreams upon her face. Through dimples in her cheek, And smiles which trace the subtle grace Of innocence asleep. âI was dreaming,â she made reply, A blush her whole physique, When my kerchief fell upon the fly That lit upon her cheek; Hard by the laughing brooklet's sheen Caught the poise of her face between, Demurring pout and sly grimace, Through her dishelved hair; As she stood there an angel fair With innocence awake. THE RAPE OF THE FLOWERS. Wails, wails, wails, The wind from its ice bound thrones; Along the path it trails, And whistles and roams Across the gray old fields. Sweeps, sweeps, sweeps, Together the falling leaves, And up the hillside leaps Through the naked trees; There shrieks, and roars, and storms; And shakes, shakes, shakes His mantle that holds the snows Till the mute and silent flake, Its purity throws O'er all the dreary earth. Then drives along the rain, The cold benumbing rain; Across the dreary plain, Blows the hurricane And freezes o'er the snow. Till all is hard, cold ice, Transparent, luminous ice, Whose dumb but stern device The rivers entice To stand at last congealed. Weeping now the angels go, Since Winter's seductive hand Polluted lovely Flo, And his grim command Her nectary fills with ice. At the kiss of hoar frost, The radiant angel swooned, Of dire grief died, and lost Her beautiful bloomâ Her rare ethereal bloom. TO A FLOWER ON A CORPSE. Ah, thou beautiful embellishment of earth, By dew, and rain, and dutiful spring hurled, A thing of loveliness, into this world Of woe, and discord, and the cruel dearth That blights our desires, and turns our hearth Into a charnel house; nor king, nor earl, Nor wit, can provoke the sad heart to mirth, Where our hopes all end and our colors furl. Fit emblem of man's transient stage art thou; This morn beheld thee delightfully fair, Full of fragrance, pleasingly sweet; but now, This eve, thy withered form sleeps on the prow Of that barque grim Death is launching out there, In the omnivorous sea of dispair.
