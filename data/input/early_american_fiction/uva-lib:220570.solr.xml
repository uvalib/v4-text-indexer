      <field name="fulltext">SYDNEY CLIFTON CHAPTER I. THE TRIUMPH OF VILLANY.—ITS HAZARDS. “He hath a daily beauty in his life, That makes me ugly.” “For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty, That can torment him much, and hold him long, It shall be his.” Othello. The elder Mr. De Lyle, whose early attachment to Clifton was evinced by placing him in so favourable a situation in his counting-room, that, with ordinary application, he would speedily acquire all the knowledge requisite to success in mercantile pursuits, learned with the most poignant regret the conspicuous part assigned to his protegé, both in the offences connected with the gamblers, and the duel which succeeded. That kind and benevolent merchant had previously observed, with high gratification, the promptitude, tact, and judgment displayed by our hero in critical business emergencies, which was not a little increased on ascertaining that his leisure hours were spent in strengthening and perfecting the powers of his intellect, rather than in the idle pursuit of frivolity and amusement. That Clifton's services were almost indispensable to the successful prosecution of Mr. De Lyle's extensive business operations will be readily conceived; but it is no more than justice to the latter gentleman to state that his regret for the young man's supposed criminality arose from no selfish or interested considerations. A long and harmonious intercourse had resulted in a warm but respectful attachment on the part of the clerk, and a confiding and no less ardent regard on that of the employer; and Mr. De Lyle's unhappiness on learning the disgrace of poor Clifton could scarcely have been augmented if it had fallen to the lot of his only son. The unpleasant feelings caused by these untoward events had prevented the worthy gentleman from enjoying his usual rest, on the night that followed Clifton's departure for Europe; and arising early, he proceeded to the counting-room to wile away the time previous to the customary breakfast hour. The more he dwelt on the subject of Clifton's alleged delinquencies, the more fully he became convinced that there were unexplained circumstances connected with the transactions in which he was Vol. II.—B implicated; for that a high-minded, frank, and moral individual should suddenly descend to the lowest depths of depravity and baseness, appeared to his experience in human nature improbable and unnatural. Occupied with these thoughts, he reached his office as the porter was unlocking the door; and throwing himself into his chair, he still continued to meditate on Clifton's unfortunate situation. He had not long been seated when his son entered the counting-room, and appeared not a little disconcerted at meeting his father at so unusual an hour. The elder Mr. De Lyle thought it no less surprising that the young gentleman, whose devotion to morning slumbers was proverbial, had accidentally selected the same day with himself to break through an obstinate habit. “Why, my son,” said Mr. De Lyle, “to what strange circumstance may I attribute this early visit to the counting-room? It is rare indeed to find you abroad at this hour.” “Oh, you know that poor Sydney has been compelled to abandon his post rather abruptly, so I thought it necessary for me to bestir myself until some capable person is installed in his situation,” replied the ready-witted roué. A long conversation on various topics ensued, a large portion of which was devoted to Clifton's arrest and disgrace; and the wily junior more than emulated his parent's liberality in framing excuses for his apparent offences. After perusing the morning papers, the younger Mr. De Lyle unlocked the ponderous iron safe in which were placed the most valuable and important papers belonging to the firm, and opening a private drawer, exclaimed, with well-feigned surprise, “Dear father, I thought you placed the three thousand dollars paid us on Saturday afternoon after bank hours, in this drawer. How does it happen that it is not here now? Have you removed it?” “Look again, my son,” replied the senior; “I have not been near the office since I placed it in the drawer, and if it is not there we are certainly robbed.” “It is surely missing,” was the reply, “and has been abstracted in a most mysterious manner, for neither the lock of the chest nor that of the drawer appears injured in the least.” On questioning the porter, he stated that the doors of the counting-room and storehouse were locked when he arrived, and that all things appeared in the same state about the premises that they were in when he closed the office on the preceding Saturday evening. As Clifton was the only person entrusted with duplicate keys, and as the robbery had evidently been perpetrated by a person whose knowledge of the premises was perfect, it is not surprising that the faith of the elder Mr. De Lyle in our hero's integrity was somewhat shaken by the strong presumptive proofs that were arrayed against him. To confirm these suspicions, his son artfully introduced several circumstances which tended to Clifton's crimination, although he continued most vehemently to protest that he did not for a moment believe him guilty of the robbery. The substance of these statements was, that the younger De Lyle had, on reaching the boat, previous to Clifton's embarkation, incidentally communicated to him the fact that a large sum of money was deposited in the iron safe, at the same time requesting from him the keys of the storehouse, office, safe, and drawers, to which Clifton had replied that they were left at his boarding-house. De Lyle farther said, that having accidentally observed Clifton withdraw a bunch of keys from his pocket, and hastily thrust them back again, while at the house of his foster parents, which he at the time supposed were the office keys, he requested him to examine his pockets again, lest they might inadvertently be still in his possession, which Clifton affected to do, and again stating that they were at his lodgings, abruptly directed the boatmen to push from the wharf, and waved a hasty and unceremonious adieu. On the recital of these circumstances, the porter was despatched to Clifton's former residence, and soon returned with the missing keys, stating that he was informed by the servant who gave them to him, that a man, dressed in the apparel of a seaman, had left them at the house on the previous morning at a very early hour. Not with standing these criminating circumstances, the younger De Lyle did not fail to accompany his detail of every additional proof of Clifton's guilt, with the remark that he was still unconvinced of his participation in the robbery. “Poor Clifton,” he said, “cannot be capable of so base and ungrateful an act, the more especially as you, father, have ever been his firm and undeviating friend. No, no; I'll not believe it. That he may have been led to the gaming-house and become fascinated with the excitement which has lured so many to their ruin, is not improbable; but to suppose him guilty of so daring a robbery is what I will never do, except on the most conclusive testimony.” On farther consultation, it was deemed expedient to offer a reward of three hundred dollars for the recovery of the money and the detection of the robber, or two hundred, for the delivery of the money only. The following day an individual, apparently of the middle rank in life, called at the counting-room of De Lyle, Howard &amp; Co., and solicited a private interview with the senior partner of the firm. Being introduced to the elder Mr. De Lyle, he stated that he called in consequence of perceiving, by an advertisement in the papers of the day, that the firm had been robbed of a large sum of money, and having cause to believe that he was acquainted with some facts connected with the robbery, he deemed it his duty to furnish the information. He then related, that B* about five o'clock on the morning of the preceding Sabbath, just before the dawn of day, he observed by the light of a lamp three individuals, two of whom were evidently seamen, while the third was a tall and well-dressed young gentleman, emerging from a store in the neighbourhood of that of De Lyle, Howard &amp; Co., but from the circumstance of his not being a resident of the city, he could not positively identify the premises. His first impressions were, that they harboured an evil design; but the apparent knowledge displayed by the young gentleman, of the fastenings of the establishment, and the business-like air with which he returned to a second examination after leaving the premises, convinced him that all was right. Curiosity having induced him to watch the movements of the party, he followed them at a short distance, and observed them enter a row-boat, and proceed towards a vessel that lay in the stream. During this recital, the features of Mr. De Lyle attested the anguish of his feelings, for it dissipated the last doubt that still lingered on his mind of our hero's participation in the robbery. The relater, who called himself James Wallis, farther stated, that he recollected distinctly hearing the name of De Lyle mentioned by one of the party, as they closed the door; remarking, that a letter to his address would, if left in the post-office, reach him through a friend residing in the city, should his testimony be found useful at any subsequent period. This statement was afterward communicated by Mr. De Lyle to his son, who, with much assumed reluctance, asserted that he could no longer doubt Clifton's guilt, however painful such a conclusion was to his feelings, in consequence of the friendship he professed to have before entertained for the culprit. Being now confident that the last link in the chain of Clifton's ruin was complete, De Lyle called at the dwelling of Mr. Elwell, to communicate the additional testimony of his guilt to some member of the family, who, he was persuaded would repeat the tale to Miss Borrowdale; but his pleasure was somewhat lessened on learning that the unhappy girl had returned to the residence of her parents in Massachusetts. Helen, however, on the receipt of his card, descended to the parlour, and on inquiring the news of the day, was informed of those circumstances with which the reader is acquainted, and which were so fatally calculated to criminate our doomed hero. During the recital, the piercing eye of Helen Elwell was steadily fixed on the features of the relater; and perceiving that he evidently quailed before the intensity of her gaze, she ventured, as he paused, to remark, with much solemnity of tone and manner:— “Mr. De Lyle, circumstances unnecessary to detail have placed in my possession the most conclusive proofs of your agency in effecting the destruction of Mr. Clifton; and pardon me when I declare that a more malignant or discreditable conspiracy toruin a reputable and virtuous citizen, has never come to my knowledge. That these efforts have been caused by the unmanly passion of jealousy, is also within my knowledge; and although your skill in deception has diverted the attention of Mr. Clifton from yourself to another individual, yet the time is approaching, when the world will be informed of your criminality. Being perfectly advised of all the facts, I, of course, require no admissions from yourself; but as you value your reputation and future prospects, devise some speedy method of exonerating Mr. Clifton from the imputations which rest on his character. A week, even a day, may be too late; for the train is already laid, which, if permitted to explode, will overwhelm you with inevitable destruction.” The artful girl clearly perceived, as she proceeded, that the conjectures aroused by the sudden start of De Lyle at the interview which has been described in a previous chapter, were confirmed by his deportment on the present occasion; nor did her judgment fail to detect, in his frequent visits to Miss Borrowdale, the object whose attractions had led him to such desperate measures for the prostration of his rival. Rising, therefore, as she closed her address, with a stern countenance and gesture of command, she appeared to the alarmed roué the priestess of destiny, pronouncing the doom whose unspeakable horrors had frequently been revealed to his mental sight in the shadowy land of dreams, and which now excited in his bosom the most intense feelings of apprehension. Impressed with the belief that Burchard had, by some means, been induced to betray him, and determined, if practicable, to learn the truth, as well as the extent of Helen's information, he said, “I regret, Miss Elwell, that some malicious talebearer has been insinuating in your ear charges against me of so discreditable a character as your language implies. Surely, no reputable individual could have thus calumniated me.” Helen, who recollected Burchard's testimony on the examination of the gamblers, as related in the daily papers, replied, “Sir, the tools which envy and malice select, are not, usually, either reputable or honourable. That they are ready to join in the basest and most desperate undertakings for a bribe, should cause their employers to distrust them; for he, who, to accommodate you, slanders Clifton to-day, may be equally willing to confess the truth to-morrow, if he finds a more liberal patron. But enough has been said. I have pointed out the course your safety demands: if you follow my advice, it is well:—if not, your ruin be on your own head!” The earnestness of her manner completely divested De Lyle of his usual confidence, and baffled all attempts to preserve his accustomed noncha lance; and on her affecting to retire, he caught her hand, and in the most abject and beseeching tone, exclaimed, “My dear Miss Elwell, for Heaven's sake tell me at once what you know concerning this unfortunate business. If any one has charged me with slandering Clifton, I declare most solemnly that he has asserted a falsehood.” “This, sir, is mockery,” was Helen's reply. “If you had frankly admitted the facts, of which I am in full possession, I intended to point out a course which would save you from the threatened exposure. As, however, you choose to preserve an attitude of defiance, it is well. Neither soliciting nor desiring your confidence, it is useless to prolong this interview. Before to-morrow's sun shall have gone down, you will vainly wish you had been more ingenuous with one who can have no earthly motive to inflict on you an injury.” “Miss Elwell, I will place myself entirely under your guidance, if you will but tell me of what I am accused and who is my accuser. I know of but one person in this city who harbours ill-will against me, and his character is such that it appears almost impossible that a lady of your rank and respectability can have listened to any tale which he could invent.” “Well would it be for you, Mr. De Lyle, if his testimony was unsupported by others of less questionable respectability; but he who deals with treacherous hirelings must expect them to emulate his cunning, by fortifying themselves with sufficient proofs, to be used if subsequent occasion requires.” As Miss Elwell finished speaking, the entrance of a visiter suspended the conversation, and this contest of wits, which promised victory to the lady, was still partially a drawn battle, although the fair antagonist of De Lyle had discovered the defect in his armour, and was fully prepared to avail herself of the advantage. Compelled to await farther developments until the arrival of a more favourable opportunity, De Lyle bowed himself out of the room, saying to Helen, as he left, that he would do himself the pleasure of again paying his respects on the following day. On the departure of her visiter, Miss Elwell retired to her boudoir, not a little gratified at the prospective success of her efforts to draw from De Lyle a confession which would lay bare the plans he had conceived and matured for the ruin of his rival. Her motives for her conduct in this matter were so complicated, that it is difficult to sift the pure from the selfish, or determine precisely the line which separated the one from the other. Her passion for Clifton, although not of that absorbing nature which would rush to the possession of its object through peril and disgrace, was yet sufficiently powerful to seek a return at the expense of much personal exertion, if it involved no consequences calculated to jeopard her standing in fashionable society. The arguments she had advanced to impress on the mind of Julia a conviction of Clifton's unworthiness, if not successful to the desired extent, had sufficed to induce a tacit acquiescence in their force; and measuring the feelings of her cousin by the standard erected in her own breast, she did not hesitate to conclude that a few months' residence in the secluded mansion of her parents would effectually wean her from an attachment of such recent and rapid growth. This prominent obstacle to her wishes being, as she believed, fully removed, her better feelings, combined with a decided penchant for the handsome and intelligent exile, induced her, as has been perceived, to place in requisition all her shrewdness and tact, to exonerate him from unmerited disgrace. That she had struck the true chord was evident, nor was she displeased when the presence of a third party interrupted the conversation with De Lyle, before he had the opportunity to insist upon an explanation which she would have been compelled to evade. Possessed of a cool, calculating mind, whose discriminating perceptions were undimmed by the shadows of feeling, she rarely judged erroneously when the premises were unfolded to her mental gaze; nor was she wrong in the supposition that De Lyle's suspicions of the fidelity and secrecy of his vicious subordinate, which she had fully awakened, would excite a continued distrust and apprehension, fatal to his peace, and eminently calculated, by unnerving the roué, to plunge him head-long into the trap by which she hoped to ensnare him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II.—C CHAPTER II. WOMAN'S DEVOTION. “She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Prey on her damask cheek.” On learning the certainty of Clifton's departure for a distant land, Julia's spirits, late so buoyant, were entirely prostrated, while the continued efforts of her cousin to depreciate him in her estimation tended to augment the despondency that rested like an incubus on her mind. After again and again perusing the only brief record in her possession of her lover's fond remembrance, the last doubt of his perfect innocence of all intentional participation in the offences of which the gamblers stood charged vanished; and from that moment his image became enshrined in her inmost soul, which mirrored to her sense a being pure as comely, unstained by aught but the unintentional death of one who sought his own life, and glowing with little less than the brightness of angelic beauty! Fearing that the prejudices which her cousin Helen entertained against Clifton had induced her to interpose obstacles to his obtaining an interview with herself, she summoned her maid to her presence, and inquired whether any gentleman had called to see her during her absence, or when she was engaged, within a day or two past. The guilty girl, perceiving a letter in Julia's hand which she observed was in Clifton's hand-writing, delivered, as will be recollected, through Helen, without her knowledge, and presuming that it communicated his frequent attempts to obtain an interview, was not a little puzzled to frame a suitable reply. Her hesitation and embarrassment were remarked by Julia, whose suspicions of her cousin's agency in banishing Clifton from her presence, and of the girl's participation in the scheme, were now fully aroused. “Well, Mary,” she said, in a tone of unusual asperity, “why do you hesitate? Surely my question is simple and intelligible. As you are not accustomed to be deficient in readiness of reply, there must be some extraordinary cause for your present embarrassment.” The deceitful girl plainly perceived that her mistress was too much in earnest to tolerate any subterfuge, and having received substantial evidences of De Lyle's liberality, and the promise of further reward, she deemed it most advisable to affect displeasure at Julia's remark, and accordingly replied, “I don't see what right you have to abuse me, because I can't in a minute tell the name of every man that called at the door; besides I can't remember them all if I try. There's that Clifton, the black-leg, wanted me to carry up his card, but I guess I served him about right for his impudence, by throwing it in the gutter. If you ain't pleased, I am ready to go away, for I don't choose to dance attendance on thieves and blacklegs.” The girl's insolence would at any time have insured her dismissal, but the coarse epithets applied to her lover so far excited Julia's indignation, that she bade her depart without a moment's delay; and as the offender cherished golden anticipations of De Lyle's future generosity, she was not averse to a separation; and in a few moments she emerged from the door, while Julia communicated to Helen her determination to accompany a friend who was going by the steamboat the same afternoon to Boston. The bustle of preparation for her departure so fully engrossed the attention of Mr. Elwell's household, that little inquiry was instituted into the cause of her maid's discharge; and as the girl had not considered it prudent to select any confidante to her transactions with De Lyle, all remained ignorant of the reasons for her dismissal. On the arrival of Julia at the residence of her affectionate parents, they perceived, with anxiety and alarm, that the bloom had left her cheek; while the cheerful smile which shed its sunny influence on all previous to her temporary absence, was succeeded by a profound melancholy, which her vain efforts to dispel rendered doubly apparent. Attributing her languor and debility to the fatigue of travelling, she retired to her room to meditate on Clifton's love, which, like Aaron's rod, was destined to swallow up all less powerful affections and desires. On reflection, she determined to inform her parents of the aspersions thrown on Clifton's character, and her conviction of their injustice; but that maiden reserve which hesitated to whisper the secret of its love even to her own breast, forbade her acknowledging the passion she entertained for our hero. Although the mature and unbiassed judgment of Mr. Borrowdale failed to perceive the force of many circumstances on which Julia relied to establish Clifton's innocence, yet the opinion he had previously formed of his character, united with the facts which were, as may be supposed, placed in the most favourable light, induced him to hope that his faults were rather the offspring of rashness and precipitation, than the baser lineage of innate depravity. While his partiality for our hero dictated this apology for his apparent delinquencies, he was compelled to doubt the justice of Julia's suspicions of De Lyle; nor could he select from her narrative any well-authenticated fact, which in his judgment, exculpated Clifton from the censure due to an association with professed gamblers. Although this unfavourable decision was, in tenderness to Julia's opinions, rather hinted at than expressed, yet the quickened perceptions of the lovely girl did not fail to construe C* its full import; and, despairing of creating converts to her favourable estimate of her lover's character, she determined to nurse her passion in secret, nor participate in any conversation of which he was the subject. This natural determination of a sensitive and delicate mind induced a reserve and shyness foreign to her former habits, until at length she almost entirely confined herself to the solitude of her chamber, brooding, like the struck eagle, over pangs whose intensity receive little alleviation from the consciousness that her own breast feathered the arrow that created them. These lonely musings were remarked by her fond parents, who saw with alarm that some fatal but invisible malady was preying on her system, the progress of which was marked by increased debility and nervous excitement, and which, if not speedily arrested. would consign the envied heiress of Mr. Borrowdale's immense wealth to the narrow confines of a premature grave. After repeated solicitations by Mr. Borrowdale and his lady, that she would permit the attendance of an eminent physician, she reluctantly assented, but the acknowledged skill of the disciple of Hypocrates, failed to remove a disease, whose origin was beyond the reach of his art. How wonderful, how delicate, how sensitive, yet how fearful, is the love of woman! Pervading every recess of the soul; gathering strength from resistance, and buoyancy from pressure: high, holy, and beautiful in its purity, erratic and fearful in its licentiousness: rivalling the hurricane in its impetuosity, the avalanche in power, it sweeps over the heart, prostrating every obstacle in its career, and burying in one common grave all opposing affections, prejudices, hopes, and desires. Emblem of permanence where all else is mutable! type of immortality in a world on whose banners are inscribed decay and dissolution! unfathomable as eternity! inscrutable as fate! transmuting selfishness into disinterestedness, and fear into bravery:—when chaste, in its crucible the grosser desires become etherealized and refined, until the passions of earth assume the purity of heaven, and mortal devotion lights its censer at the altar of divinity! For Julia, there was nothing left but hopelessness and sorrow. He who alone made existence tolerable, was removed to another clime, and henceforth, days, weeks, months might pass, but no sunny influences would cheer her path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH A NEW FACE. THE DECEIVER DECEIVED. “Here dives the skulking thief with practised sleight, And unfelt fingers make thy pocket light: Where's now the watch with all its trinkets? flown! And thy late snuff-box is no more thy own.” Gay. The morning sun had just paid his devoirs to the labour-doomed race, who alone welcomed his diurnal advent to the metropolis, as Thomas Burchard unbarred the door of the dilapidated domicil of which he was an inmate, and, with many a yawn, gave intimation of his readiness to accommodate early customers, by throwing open the shutters, and thus exhibiting, as conspicuously as the soiled window-panes would permit, the decanters containing that inviting beverage, which, in the language of his intimates, was declared, like the hair of certain of the canine species, a sovereign remedy for the bite inflicted in the previous night's debauch. That this early devotion to the “main chance,” secured its appropriate reward, was evinced by the numerous “peep-o'-day boys” who entered the tavern, while the motley appearance of these morning devotees at the shrine of Bacchus would have offered a rare study for the disciple of Hogarth. The unfortunate schemer, whose tattered habiliments testified that the desire to appropriate his neighbour's goods to his own use had met with little success, stood in amiable proximity to the spruce and genteelly clad legatee of some wealthy citizen's wardrobe:—here sat an attenuated being, rejoicing in apparel whose dimensions were sufficiently ample for the person of Daniel Lambert in the palmy days of his corpulency—while by his side lounged a herculean associate, over whose huge limbs were drawn a coat and pantaloons whose lack of width and length exhibited the proportions of the wearer in painful relief:—over the brow of one a broad-brimmed beaver threw its ample shadow, while on his neighbour's cranium perched a razeed castor, of scarce sufficient capacity to reach the wearer's forehead. After the morning stimulus had been swallowed, the fashionably-attired lounger gradually withdrew to as great a distance from the more humble canàille as the limited dimensions of the apartment would permit. The uninitiated in the etiquette which reigns in flash circles, may suppose that the doctrine of equal rights, privileges, and courtesy, would here be displayed in its utmost latitude. Far from it. The fashionably-dressed felon spurned, with becoming disdain, the attempted familiarities of his less fortunate associates, while the nonchalance with which the intimate of yesterday was cut by the lucky rascal of to-day, might have served as a model for the most elegant exquisite who sports his figure on the sunny side of Broadway. That the fancied ascendancy of “the observed of all observers” among these “children of fortune,” was peculiarly brief in its duration, will be admitted, but this circumstance neither humbled his pretensions, nor palliated the severity of his edicts. With that indifference to the future, which in the deposed monarchs of the old world passes for royal firmness among their admirers, but is denominated stupidity by the advocates of the “mouvement”— the leader of ton in flash society riots in authority during his little hour, is dethroned, superseded and forgotten. To Thomas Burchard those shades of character exhibited among the devotees at the temple of which he was the officiating dignitary, passed like an idle pageant, of which he took no cognizance. Viewing them all as “fish to his net,” his attentions were alone directed to the gains arising from their presence, and the most courted of the circle lost his charm for Thomas, whenever he ceased to replenish the drained goblet. While thus occupied, a boy of some twelve years of age entered the tavern, and inquiring for Burchard gave him a note and immediately withdrew. Observing the superscription to be in a handwriting different from any with which he was familiar, he seized the first moment of leisure to peruse its contents. That its import was far from uninteresting to him, the reader will perceive on perusing the following copy of the epistle. New-York, —, —. Mr. Thomas Burchard, “Aware that you are on terms of familiar incourse with Mr. Edward De Lyle, I take the liberty of hinting that circumstances have occurred which may tend to inculpate either yourself or him before the public, in relation to transactions with which you are fully acquainted. “The fact of my being personally unknown to yourself, while I admit a knowledge of Mr. De Lyle, might lessen your confidence in my communication, did I fail to inform you that I have wrongs to redress, and vengeance to inflict on their author. This warning, to be effectual or useful, must for the present be withheld from Mr. De Lyle. Recollect, I do not say that he has threatened an exposure, but you will judge whether it is probable that he will plead guilty himself for the magnanimous purpose of screening you from punishment. All that I would recommend for the present is unceasing vigilance, and if I hereafter impart facts which incontrovertibly prove his treachery and your danger—then be prepared to act promptly and fearlessly, and no harm shall befall you. “Till then farewell, “A— V—.” The offspring of Glenthorne in early life, by a female of the lowest rank in society, whose grovelling appetites were connected with serpent-like craftiness, the savage ferocity which Burchard inherited from the one parent was tempered and controlled by the stealth and wariness so conspicuous in the other. On receiving what he considered a personal insult, the indignant blood would rush manfully to his cheek and his sluggish eye flash momentary defiance, when that sleepless caution which ever guarded him from the consequences of his more violent passions, would successfully interpose ere the hesitating tongue could second the rash and hazardous impulse. Summoning an assistant to discharge the duties of bar-keeper, he retired to his chamber, where, after giving vent to his feelings in a few hearty curses on the head of De Lyle, he deliberately reflected on the most effectual method of turning the tables on that worthy. The result of his cogitations was a conviction that the roué was completely in his power, and with that natural shrewdness and cunning which had been sharpened by a long intercourse with felons and swindlers, he conceived a plan, which could not, in his opinion, fail to accomplish the destruction of his treacherous patron and associate, whenever the measure was expedient. That he had frequently reflected on the probability of such a crisis is more than probable, from his knowledge of the character of De Lyle, as well as from his general estimate of human nature, which could not be otherwise than unfavourable from the school in which his knowledge of mankind had been learned. His course determined on, he again descended to the tap-room, and it would have required an acute observer to discover the traces of agitation in his sallow cheek and dull grey eye. If the reader has carefully noted the relations existing between De Lyle and Burchard, he or she will have perceived that the roué was compelled, by the nature of the services required from his instrument, to lay bare the machinery which gave effect to his operations, and thus furnish an array of evidence which could not fail to be destructive to his future success, whenever Burchard should deem it advisable to hazard an exposure. That De Lyle, at times, was impressed with these obvious reflections is most true, but he consoled himself with the idea that there could scarcely exist a sufficient motive for Burchard to hazard what little reputation he possessed, for the sole purpose of implicating his employer. In addition to the consolation drawn from such a Vol. II.—D train of reasoning, De Lyle had formed a very humble estimate of the mental powers of his willing subordinate, and was extremely doubtful of his abilities to conceive or mature a successful plot for his overthrow, even if circumstances should arise which might render it his future interest to make the attempt. Lest the reader should be surprised at De Lyle's erroneous conclusions in relation to the mental calibre of one with whom he had so long held intercourse, it is proper to premise that no event had occurred during their intimacy to excite the passions or energies of Burchard, who received full instructions from the former in every emergency, and confined his agency to obedience to orders, without question or hesitation. Such was the happy state of De Lyle's mind on this subject, until the mysterious language of Helen Elwell awoke the most alarming suspicions, which farther conversation with the artful girl almost matured into conviction. To assure himself of the truth, however painful might be its import, appeared his only course, and he awaited with no little impatience the arrival of the succeeding morning, when he could visit Burchard's residence unobserved. It is proper here to remark, that the success of his scheme for Clifton's destruction had, as he conceived, rendered Burchard's further agency in his affairs unnecessary, and he now determined to sever the untoward connection with as little delay as his personal interests would permit. The shades of evening had no sooner settled over the metropolis, than De Lyle directed his steps to the domicil of his vicious associate. He was, as usual, received by Burchard in an apartment adjoining the tap-room of the tavern, but no one who was familiar with the cordiality which characterized their former interviews, would have failed to observe the embarrassment and hesitation of De Lyle on his entrance, nor the suspicious, although less obvious, twinkle of Burchard's usually dull eye. As it was the invariable practice of the subordinate to await De Lyle's commands, whenever he chose to visit his humble dwelling, he quietly seated himself on the settee, after directing his visiter to enjoy the comforts of an arm-chair. The silence that ensued after they were seated, tended to increase the discomposure of De Lyle's features, while the malignant feelings of Burchard were more strikingly manifested as he viewed what he conceived full confirmation of his quondam friend's treachery. “Well, Burchard,” at length began De Lyle, “we've been sad dogs in our day, but, as there's a time for all things, I suppose we must soon do as other reformed rakes have done before us, turn saints, and prosecute all such ungodly reprobates as will not fit our Procrustean bed.” The roué's delivery of this speech savoured much of previous preparation, for he continually shifted his eyes from Burchard to opposite sides of the room, while the words fell from his lips like the hard-studied task of a school-boy who recites the lesson without any apparent sympathy in feeling with the sentiments designed to be illustrated. To this sally, which was intended as an entering-wedge to further conversation, Burchard made no reply; but the first essay had somewhat tended to re-assure and compose the speaker's mind, and he continued, “Come, Burchard, what do you think of this plan? Won't we make as good professors as most of those who pay the barber double price for shaving their long faces?” “Humph,” replied Burchard, “I've nothing to do with hypocrites. I'm a poor man, and have enough to think of to take care of number one.” “But without joking, Burchard, I feel like backing out of all my old practices—for two reasons— one is, I can't raise the wind as I used to, and the other is, that I'm afraid I might lead you into some difficulty by and by. You've already run a great many risks, of which nothing but good fortune has cleared your skirts, and I feel continually alarmed lest some harm may yet befall you, in consequence of your being exposed.” The over shrewd roué spoke thus to impress Burchard's mind with the danger he would incur, if their crimes were discovered; but it had, as may be imagined, the opposite effect, by convincing the latter that De Lyle's visit was intended to divert his attention from himself whenever his treachery should accomplish its purpose. “Well, that's friendly of you, any how,” said Burchard, who now determined to foil him with his own weapons. “I suppose if I get into trouble, you'll come out at once and be my bail. I tell you what it is, I shouldn't like to lay in that old Bridewell for only one night.” “Oh yes, you may depend on me,” said De Lyle, “you will not lack a friend if you get in trouble.” Satisfied from the countenance of Burchard, which had resumed its accustomed appearance of stolidity, that he had effectually swerved him from his treacherous purpose, if such had entered his mind, De Lyle returned to his father's mansion, and enjoyed that calm undisturbed repose, which failed to visit his couch on the previous night. “The infernal scoundrel!” was Burchard's exclamation, as his visiter crossed the threshold, “he thinks he's got me as safe as a thief in a mill; but if I don't turn up the trump card and win the game, after giving him two, then my name ain't Thomas Burchard.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">New-York, —, —.

      <field name="fulltext">D* CHAPTER IV. TREACHERY MAY CLOSE ITS EYES, BUT NEVER SLEEPS. “Thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made, And peace itself is war in masquerade.” Dryden. Although De Lyle's interview with Burchard had somewhat allayed the excitement of his feelings, it had not succeeded in completely removing his apprehensions of his confederate's treachery. Despite his attempts to banish unwelcome fears, the malignant and apparently triumphant expression of Burchard's countenance, during a portion of the time occupied in endeavouring to win him from his treacherous purpose, would recur vividly to his imagination, affording a more faithful, but less satisfactory view of the depths of his character, and seeming to indicate passions and energies which, if fully aroused, would render him a troublesome and dangerous antagonist. Such were De Lyle's feelings on the morning succeeding his visit to the residence of Burchard; but as weeks and months passed away, and still no circumstance arose to confirm his suspicions, he began to breathe more freely, and at length, if his thoughts dwelt at any time on the painful subject, the emotion it excited was feeble, and the danger, if any, appeared too remote to renew apprehension. On the day following his visit to Burchard, De Lyle called at the residence of Mr. Elwell, and succeeded in finding Helen at home, but the presence of a number of morning visiters effectually prevented a tête-à-tête, and after awaiting an opportunity for a private interview, until his patience became exhausted, he made his congé and withdrew. In two or three subsequent calls he was equally unfortunate, either from the same cause, or in consequence of Miss Elwell's absence, until his fears becoming less vivid, he deemed it unwise to precipitate a crisis which might, he trusted, be avoided, by a show of confidence. Meanwhile, his daily visits to the residence of Rachel Samuel, which were less frequent during the prevalence of his apprehensions in relation to Burchard's disclosures, were resumed; and, as confidence in his good fortune, and exemption from impending calamity became restored, his unbridled passions again assumed their empire. That he enjoyed happiness in its true sense will not be supposed, but his jaded appetites required some powerful stimulant to arouse them from their lethargy, and his invention was continually taxed to furnish aliment wherewith to appease them. Like the horse-leech at the vein, they cried “give, give,” thus rendering the roué at once their slave and prisoner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE FATHER OF CITIES BY MOONLIGHT.—ITS EFFECT ON A WAYFARER. “When night first bids the twinkling stars appear, Then swarms the busy street; with caution tread Where the shop-windows, falling, threat thy head.” “Celestial queen! put on thy robes of light, Now Cynthia named, fair regent of the night; Oh may thy silver lamp, from heaven's high bower, Direct my footsteps in the midnight hour.” Gay. While the events we have chronicled were taking place in the western hemisphere, the gallant ship which conveyed Clifton from his native land had arrived at Liverpool, after a tedious passage, whence he proceeded to the great metropolis of the British empire. As the shores of his beloved country receded from his view, his lonely and desolate situation arose vividly before him, and, descending to the state-room, he threw himself into his berth in an agony of grief. As the passing days winged their flight to join the countless throng that had preceded them, the poignancy of his feelings abated, but sufficient gloom remained to prevent any approach to familiar intercourse with his fellow-passengers, all of whom attributed his reserve to bodily illness and debility. But it is not in human nature, more especially in youth's blooming season, to brood long over even the most serious calamities. That elasticity of spirit which is vouchsafed to the youthful voyager on life's tempestuous ocean, will ensure a rebound from the most intolerable pressure. The sorrowful Clifton, whose prospects for the future were so cruelly blasted, felt sensibly the change from the monotony and confinement of a ship's cabin to the free and invigorating air of his father-land; nor could the varied specimens of human character, and the attractive objects, both animate and inanimate, which continually arrested his attention, fail to dissipate a portion of the grief that preyed on his spirit. As the mail coach, in which he was a passenger, entered the suburbs of that mighty city, which has been not inaptly compared to Babylon the Great, in the zenith of its power and splendour, the evening shadows began to darken the horizon; but the time that intervened between the first evident approaches to London, and the arrival of the coach at the tavern where it put up, afforded some clew to the magnitude of the vast emporium. The soft clear light of the full moon, as she pursued her course in cloudless majesty—like the departed spirit of the just in its flight to brighter spheres—threw its witchery around every object on which it fell, awakening in the bosom of Clifton the dormant romance of his nature, and soothing, if not entirely banishing, for the moment, the memory of past sorrows and the anticipation of those which were in prospect. As the coach, with its wearied occupants, passed through the streets of the crowded mart, the bold outline of many a specimen of architecture of a by-gone age, threw its shadow across their path; while at intervals some huge pile of masonry lifted its Titan form against the sky, giving the vivid imagination of Clifton a wide range of conjecture in tracing the eventful scenes of which its antiquated halls had probably been the witness. Although born and bred in a populous and extensive city, yet its contrast in form and magnitude with that which he was now entering, was peculiarly striking and impressive. In his native city, the few ancient buildings owning a Dutch origin, which had survived the last century, were already sacrificed to the spirit of innovation and improvement, until modern taste had moulded its erections almost into uniformity of model, although in magnitude, finish, and quality of material, they were widely variant. London, on the contrary, presented the singular aspect of an enormous Mosaic tablet, in which all the different specimens of ancient and modern architecture, were so blended as to produce a striking and picturesque, if not beautiful effect. Although these obvious reflections did not occur to Clifton, until the arrival of day-light and more extensive observation had exhibited the great city in its general aspect, yet sufficient was seen on his first entrance to create a desire for a more minute survey of the various objects which were dimly distinguished in the moonlight. Not withstanding the temporary relief the sights and sounds of the city had afforded to his wounded spirit, yet no sooner had he attained the quiet of his lonely couch, than busy memory recalled the sorrowful images of the past in all their primeval horrors, banishing sleep from his eyelids, and renewing pangs that had for a time been steeped in forgetfulness. In vain he attempted to reason away his fears and regrets. Despair, with raven wing, hovered grimly over the future, and disgrace, misery, and banishment stalked, ghost-like, in the distance. Who that was interested in his welfare had any clew to the mystery which veiled the true history of his past conduct? Not one! His foster-father could of course know nothing of the parties, whose machinations had disgraced him in the eyes of the world, and except him, his wife, and Julia, there were none in the wide world on whose attachment he could rely. And could he really rely on Julia's fidelity and affection? Would not the opinion of the world at length overthrow even the confidence she reposed in his innocence? Was he even certain that she believed his solemn asseverations? These were questions that occurred to his mind day after day, and received replies as various and contradictory as were the changing phases of his mind and feelings. At times all was hope and confidence—and again all was doubt and despair. Such is human nature!—ever distrustful of the goodness of Providence, when imagination tyrannizes over the reason and judgment. The night at length was past, and the dawn of day served somewhat to tranquillize his agitated mind. As he arose and prepared to mix with the busy throng, his native firmness of character began to re-assume its sway, and he determined to make a strenuous effort so to apportion and employ his time that as little space should be left to solitary reflection as was practicable. During his leisure-hours in New-York, he had successfully cultivated his talent for literary composition, both in prose and verse, and his friends had assured him that he had been eminently successful. Here, then, was a solace for his wounded spirit, pure and honourable in its nature, and leaving no sting behind; and by this he proposed banishing unavailing regrets. That his talents had found a rare opportunity for development in the numerous and varied phenomena which were continually afforded in the western emporium will be readily conceived. The dweller in cities is enabled at a glance to view all the varieties that are comprehended within the wide-spread boundaries of human character. If Vol. II.—E his mind is formed of plastic and yielding materials, he soon becomes in habit and manners a fac-simile of the mass by whom he is surrounded, and might be safely exported to any portion of the civilized globe as a living sample of his genus. But while the attrition of continual contact and intercourse thus casts the ordinary specimens of humanity in one uniform mould, its effects on the more gifted order of mankind are “wide as the poles asunder.” In remote districts, where primeval nature is exhibited in all its rude sublimity, the child of genius adapts his conceptions to the bold and striking objects that reign in silent and solemn majesty around him; but in the thronged mart, where the lights and shadows of human character are continually presented to his vision, he attains the higher power of depicting the feelings and passions of his kind, and grasps as it were in the palm of his hand those moral elements which exercise, in their subtle and expanded operations, so potent an influence on the destinies of his species. Presented in this view, the gifted citizen is capable of wielding a more extended influence in forming national and individual character, than he whose lot has been cast in less multitudinous communities; nor can it justly be averred that he is less felicitous in the description of those natural objects which constitute so imposing a feature in most literary efforts. The constant practice of catching “the manners living as they rise” imparts a ready appreciation of the beautiful and sublime, in both the moral and physical world, while the rare opportunities afforded the citizen of beholding nature in her simple attire, lend attraction to the prospect unknown to the daily observer of her beauties. Trained in this school, Clifton in early life employed a portion of his leisure hours in throwing off graphic sketches of the beautiful scenery which skirted the banks of the noble river whose waters lave the northern boundary of the city of New-York, or in delineating the prominent characteristics of those moral excrescences which are indigenous to all overgrown and densely populated communities. In the indulgence of this talent, the habit of reflection had been acquired and exercised, until the regions of solitude became for him peopled with more interesting companions than those by whom he was daily jostled along the crowded thoroughfares, or in the thronged courts where pleasure holds her revels. The circumstances under which he had been compelled to expatriate himself, induced him to procure lodgings in a quiet and retired situation, where the ministers of justice would find difficulty in ascertaining his whereabout, if unhappily Ellingbourne's death should cause pursuit. Fortunately for his purpose of employing his time in literary undertakings the son of his landlady was connected with the publication of one of the most celebrated magazines of the day, and on learning that Clifton had finished some sketches in prose and verse, he kindly volunteered to introduce them to the notice of the senior editor. To Clifton's great gratification they were accepted, and after a brief period the emolument arising from their publication was sufficient to defray the expenses of his economical mode of living. To give the reader some idea of his talents, we subjoin a poetical effusion, which is selected not as the best specimen of his composition, but as affording a mirror in which his feelings were reflected. THE PAST. The past, the past, th' insatiate past, Within its broad domain Crushed hopes and bleeding joys lie cast, Like war's unburied slain! We saw their plumes in triumph wave, A bright and fair array; The morning mists are curling o'er The hill: but where are they? The past, the past, th' embalming past— Behold its march sublime: Garnering the harvest, prostrate cast By the bald reaper Time! Wit's diamond shaft, and learning's tome, Devotion's lore divine,— Fame's glittering wreath and poesy's crown— In added lustre shine. The past, the past, the joyous past, How bright its visions seem, When age and youth the hours contrast, Like some enchanted dream: Love's honey'd kiss, and manhood's pride, And pleasure's syren strain;— The civic wreath, the sparkling cup— All—all are ours again. The past, the past, the shadowy past, How dim the scene appears, When eyes that on us look'd their last Relume in after years. The dazzling cheat in mockery throws Its light o'er hopeless gloom, Like a faint taper's flickering ray Above the silent tomb. The past, the past, the mighty past; How boundless is its sway:— Hark! to its trumpet's summoning blast, While listening worlds obey! The conquering chief his helmet doffs— The brandish'd sceptre falls: And silence reigns where wassail shouts Rang through the festal halls. The past, the past, the storied past— Here genius sits enshrined,— On this bright fane your offerings cast, The Mecca of the mind! Beneath these arches' vaulted roofs Immortal spirits throng; Here Shakspeare's radiant fancy beams— Here Homer weaves his song! The past, the past, the new-fledged past, Even now, with raven wing Its lengthening shadows grown more vast Around my footsteps cling. My fingers vainly sweep the lyre, No answering tones arise; Pale memory flees to happier breasts, And hope to brighter skies</field>
      <field name="fulltext">E* CHAPTER VI. FANCY'S FREAKS.—A TRAGEDY. “Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?” Macbeth. “Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; While night's black agents to their prey do rouse.” Macbeth. “Ingratitude” is said to be a “marble-hearted fiend,” and though we shall not venture to maintain the converse of the proposition, we still contend that there are imps, its “next-o'-kin,” whose bad eminence is equally conspicuous. Among these children of darkness, superstition, that nightmare of the soul, exhibits demoniac attributes of equal power, and is more justly dreaded; its influence being active, while that of ingratitude is passive. To exhibit the highest evidence, we might adduce the circumstance that there are certain periods when it wields a resistless power over our own intellect, albeit the reader has no doubt assigned us a station high above the reach of all malign influences. To reveal a secret which, until now, has been treasured in our heart of hearts, we do love the silver moon with an intensity of affection passing the love of woman: there is not a wandering ray that dances joyously on its bright course through the transparent ether, but is precious in our eyes as the jewel on a sultan's turban—but if her virgin-beams first dance over our left shoulder, to hold soft dalliance with our glowing cheek, the coy advance meets a cool return; our cheerful spirits lose their wonted elasticity, and coming events cast their shadows gloomily before us. Does the world do us wrong, and despitefully entreat us? Even our warm regard cannot prevent the imputation that it isthe work of the luckless moonbeam. Have we no visible sorrows to mourn over? There were doubtless unknown joys in full career along our path, but the prophetic ray has diverted them to more fortunate bosoms. If, therefore, we are not exempt from the dominion of such untoward sprites, it is not surprising that Clifton was at all times their unwilling victim. Indeed it is capable of the most palpable demonstration that those who, like him, are rudely tossed on the billows of fate, and subject to sudden and unexpected vicissitudes, are ever prone to cast their horoscopes, and link, in imagination, their capricious destinies with the stars. That Napoleon, in all the phases of his extraordinary career, was the sport and foot-ball of this shadowy influence, is a matter of history. When in the zenith of his power, it was his constant practice to watch the aspect of his natal star, whose steady effulgence lighted him to victory; and when his fortunes experienced that decline which is the legitimate offspring of unbounded success, he viewed in its shorn beams, the herald of defeat. On one of those cheerless nights, whose prototypes have at times denied the solace of slumber to the most equable of our species, Clifton lay tossing from side to side on his lonely couch, wooing the drowsy god with genuine devotion, but receiving no answering sign to his prayers for repose. The night was clear, but there was that oppressive feeling in the atmosphere which creates lassitude and despondency, without precisely indicating the cause of such a phenomenon. Finding the attempt to sleep impracticable, his truant thoughts began to wander, and like other rebellious rovers, were not content, until the broad Atlantic separated them from their liege lord. Onward and still onward they continued their flight, nor rested their unwearied wing until the antique outline of Mr. Borrowdale's mansion was recognized and reached. After hovering timidly over the hospitable mansion, they made bold to enter the sleeping apartment of the fair Julia, gently lifting the curtain that shrouded her virgin couch, and peering most curiously into her face. But horror of horrors! what a sight presented itself! Instead of the glowing cheek and swan-like throat of his beloved, there lay her attenuated and emaciated form, robbed of its matchless charms, and struggling to retain a feeble existence. In vain he attempted to persuade himself that it was an illusion, a mockery of the brain—the whole scene, with all its terrible accessaries, was as palpable to his sense as the sun at noon-day. After repeated efforts to withdraw from the enchanted chamber, he at length succeeded, but not until the finger of his mistress pointed to a new made grave, seen distinctly in the distance, which he shuddered to think was prepared for her reception. The morning light brought relief and calm to his excited feelings, but superstition still clung to the recollection of the vision, declaring it a fatal omen, whose fulfilment was not more terrible than sure. Moody and abstracted, he found the usual solace in the employment of his pen impracticable, and after an early dinner entered an omnibus and proceeded to the remotest suburbs, hoping to calm his ruffled spirit by a resort to the excitement of motion and the presence of new objects. On the vehicle reaching its destination he alighted, and proceeded, without aim or purpose, in a direction leading from the city. While thus rambling along, he at length observed that clouds were gathering over the western horizon, which warned him of the propriety of retracing his steps. Darker and more gloomy rolled the sable clouds along as the day declined, dimming the glories of the setting sun, and robbing twilight of its shadowy and evanescent beauties. As the evening wore apace, a thick fog, such as often occurs in London, overspread the vicinity of the metropolis, enveloping the city and its environs in impenetrable darkness. The stars were totally obscured, and the city lamps, with flickering and unsteady light, appeared like faithless sentinels, whose eyes were rendered dim by the effects of a midnight revel. Untoward and cheerless as was the prospect at the close of day, the rapid transition from light to darkness was as unexpected as unwelcome to those whom business or pleasure had benighted on their journey to or from the busy mart. Clifton, in particular, was not a little chagrined at his late abstraction, which had caused him to take no note of time, nor was he aware of the distance he had traced, after descending from the omnibus. To move cautiously in the direction of the city, if the various points of the compass could be guessed at in this epitome of Egyptian darkness, was his only course. That he could reach his lodgings through the gloom was not supposed, and he therefore determined to seek lodgings for the night in the first public-house he should encounter. While pressing forward with as much speed as the darkness permitted, the footsteps of two or three individuals were heard in advance. As he pushed onward and came nearer, one of the party, in a rough voice, although apparently in a subdued tone, exclaimed, “Why, Bill, my cove, you didn't use to miss fire, but I'm blowed if I don't begin to think the rum uns have given us the slip.” “I shouldn't wonder,” replied another, “if, as they say in Kentucky, we've barked up the wrong tree. These tarnal dooks and barrens know how to play possum as well as us common chaps.” “Blood and thunder, you misbelievin varmin,” grumbled a third, “do you think I've lived to this time of day to be bamboozled by these sprigs of nobility? It takes an old fox to gammon me, and I've wintered and summered these fellows too long to fly off the track when I fairly get the scent. As Joe Simmons says, I know them inside and outside —top and bottom, and I could tell one of their hides in a tan-yard.” “Hush, hush,” said the first speaker, in a lower key, “I think I hear a footstep. Mum's the word. It wouldn't read well in history if the beaks nabbed us. Only think of our last dying speech and confession being on sale by all the principal booksellers.” “If I catch a spy listening,” almost whispered his associate, “I'll play Hamlet with him. `A rat, a rat; dead for a ducat.' Wouldn't I do for the stage?” “If you don't quit spouting, I reckon you'll mount a pla'form before the next grass,” was the reply, which caused no little merriment at the expense of Shakspeare's admirer, who retorted, “Come, come, no professional jokes, if you please. If I catch you at Moll Parson's you'll pay a bumper all round for insulting a gentleman.” Clifton inferred from this conversation that it would be advisable to increase the distance between these night-hawks and himself, and accordingly remained stationary until they had proceeded onward sufficiently to render their voices inaudible. But a few moments elapsed before the rumbling of carriage wheels was heard in the distance, and as the sound approached, the shrieks of a female, and the loud and angry tones of men's voices, attested the danger that threatened the newly arrived party. “Your money or your life, on the instant,” were the first words that saluted the ears of Clifton, as he proceeded with all possible rapidity to the rescue, and they were followed by the discharge of a pistol, the light from which, and the coach lamps, exhibited a carriage and pair, with one robber standing over the prostrate postillion, who begged most lustily that his life might be spared. A second ruffian grasped the reins, while the third was stationed at the door of the coach with a dark lanthorn in his hand and apparently in the act of rifling the inmates. All this passed in a second, when Clifton sprang forward, and with one blow prostrated the villain at the door of the carriage, placing his knee on his breast and pinning him to the earth. Observing the condition of his prostrate comrade, the antagonist of the postillion released his prisoner, and discharged a pistol at Clifton, who received the ball in his thigh. During these events the gentleman in the coach and the rescued postillion, with shouts and outcries so alarmed the two robbers who were at liberty, that they wisely took to their heels, leaving their less fortunate associate in the gripe of his wounded, but still powerful assailant. A moment sufficed to bring the rescued gentleman to the aid of Clifton, and the timely arrival of two or three labourers relieved both from the task of securing the prisoner. Fortunate was it for all parties that the latter auxiliaries appeared, for no sooner had they taken possession of the robber than Clifton fainted from the loss of blood, and falling on the earth became totally insensible. The gentleman (who with his daughters was indebted to Clifton's courage and gallantry for their release from the ruffians,) with the assistance of one of the new comers, bound up the wound, and placed the invalid in the carriage; and as the seat of Lord Templeton, the rescued party, was near by, the grateful nobleman despatched one of the labourers for a neighbouring surgeon, while he conveyed Clifton to his residence. While these arrangements were in progress, the arms of the prisoner were pinioned, and he was escorted to the nearest police station, to be dealt with as the law directed. A partial view of the captured robber exhibited a short but athletic person, whose countenance was purposely disguised by a mass of grizzled iron-grey hair flowing over his forehead, and a slouched hat Vol. II.—F which threw his face in shadow. Beneath the shaggy locks twinkled a pair of dark eyes, whose restless glances, although betraying great agitation and excitement, did not entirely lose their natural shrewdness and recklessness of expression. To all inquiries he refused reply, and was conducted by his escort in sullen silence to the place of his confinement. A discharged pistol, which was found near the spot where Clifton assailed him, was taken in charge by the party, and in a brief period the scene of so much alarm and hazard was left to its accustomed silence and repose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. A CRISIS IN OUR HERO'S HISTORY.—THE SCALES BALANCED. “Two or three groans;—it is a heavy night; 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very dreadful.” Othello. “How does your patient, doctor?” Macbeth. “Does your patient sleep?” inquired Lord Templeton of his eldest daughter, as she returned from the apartment in which Clifton lay, on the morning succeeding the attempted robbery. “He has this moment closed his eyes, for the first time, as I am informed by the nurse, since he was conveyed hither, and you cannot imagine how much I am relieved. I am informed by Dr. Hildreth that his sufferings have been intense throughout the night; and when I entered the room this morning I am certain the pain of his wound was excruciating, from the rigid expression that his features assumed while endeavouring to disguise its effects from the nurse and myself. Although I remained but a moment in his room, I shall never forget the convulsive action of the muscles of his face. Oh, dear papa, if he should not recover, how deeply will we all regret his interference, for I suppose the robbers would have been satisfied with fleecing us of our money and jewels, and what would have been their loss compared with the life of so noble-looking a fellow-being?” “Let us hope for the best, my dear child,” was the reply, as the fond father kissed the polished forehead of his charming daughter. “If our deliverer recovers, only think how happy we shall all be to minister to his comfort and happiness.” “How much like her departed mother,” thought Lord Templeton, as he slightly turned to brush away a tear that glittered in his eye at the recollection of one too fondly loved—too quickly lost. The entrance of Doctor Hildreth, who had risen after a brief sleep, served to arouse the noble lord from his reverie, and many and eager were the inquiries of that gentleman and his enthusiastic daughter, as to the particular symptoms of his patient's case, and the probabilities of his recovery. To all these questions the scientific practitioner gave truly professional replies, which were couched in terms sufficiently obscure to the fair querist, and not as definite or intelligible to Lord Templeton himself as he could have desired. Doctor Hildreth was one of those unbending apostles of the healing art, who, to an elevated consciousness of the dignity of their profession, unite a scrupulous regard for all its forms; nor did he attempt to modify or disguise the supreme contempt with which he viewed those pretenders who were springing up like mushrooms in every quarter of the civilized globe, poisoning, as he contended, the very atmosphere with their vile nostrums, and sacrificing hecatombs of human beings at the shrine of ignorance and cupidity. The learned surgeon indeed lived, and moved, and had his being alone in the regions of medical science; and while his skill, judgment and tact were the theme of universal eulogy, yet all admitted that the friends of his suffering patients had some reason to murmur at the unsatisfactory manner in which he replied to their anxious inquiries. At an earlier period indeed, not a few of his female friends had openly remonstrated against his technical explanations, but the doctor effectually silenced all such rebellious indications by the sternness of his manner, or abandoned the patient if further annoyed. Lord Templeton had, in early life, become warmly attached to the celebrated surgeon, and truly estimated his professional skill, while he honoured and esteemed his independence and manliness; nor did he fail to see beneath the surface a genuine benevolence that delighted in acts of charity, which were studiously concealed from the knowledge of the world. Doctor Hildreth had failings, but they were those of a high-minded man, who saw with disgust the successful efforts of quackery and empiricism to F* impose on the credulous; and who, in his indignation at hypocrisy and deception, at times overstepped the boundaries of good breeding, while he failed to make a sufficient allowance for the constitutional defects and frailties of his species. On the present occasion Lord Templeton determined to fathom, if possible, the doctor's precise meaning, and as he understood the whole length and breadth of his character and feelings, he from time to time permitted the conversation to flow into other channels, returning to the charge whenever an opportunity presented, and again masking his purpose behind less interesting topics. In this way he would have soon learned all he wished to ascertain, if the eager anxiety of his beautiful daughter could have been suppressed; but on the doctor's explanation nearly reaching the desired point, a direct question, hastily urged by her, would again start the surgeon off on his professional hobby, when ligaments, muscles, tendons, nerves, veins, sinews, and arteries, would be described with true technical fidelity, and their history, affinities, relations, dependencies, sympathies, connections, and functions, descanted on with the enthusiasm of a devotee. At length sufficient light was vouchsafed to indicate the dangerous character of the wound, and to make the querists aware that the necessity of amputation depended on the symptoms which might be developed within the succeeding twenty-four hours. “But, doctor,” said the young lady, “will not the operation be attended with imminent peril to his life?” “That, my good young lady, depends entirely on the state of the patient. Should the nervous excitement continue or increase—or should the general symptoms concentrate in the vicinity of the wound, and thereby become local—or should the strength of the patient rapidly give way, or the severing of the arteries cause too copious depletion—or the febrile irritation exceed a given point—or the prostrate system refuse to rally its energies—or the pain of the operation overpower the resistance which youth and robust health will oppose to its effects—if either or all these counteracting influences interpose, it is impossible to determine how far or to what extent they may operate. We practitioners of medicine, my dear lord,” he continued, turning to Lord Templeton, “are like the mariner on the wide Atlantic. We may be skilful—we may be prudent—we may be invested with every requisite attribute to insure success, and yet, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, a squall in the shape of an unexpected and fatal symptom, may shatter our most skilfully wrought professional fabric—shipwreck our hopes, and consign the despairing patient to an untimely grave. And yet, with all these inherent obstacles strewn along our path, the blind disciples of a blind fatality, recklessly rush into the professional arena, and instead of exorcising the foul spirit of disease, the mangled corses of their victims are the only trophies they exhibit.” “But if our patient should fortunately escape the necessity of having his limb amputated, then, I presume, we may fairly calculate on his recovery,” replied Lord Templeton. “My dear lord, make no rash calculations, either as to the patient's recovery or demise. I have already succeeded in extracting the ball, which lay buried in immediate proximity to the thigh bone, and so far the prospect of ultimate recovery is favourable. But it is difficult for me to explain, except to a regular practitioner, the various causes which, although now dormant, may soon awaken to activity and embarrass our best efforts. For example, the state of the young gentleman's nerves may render amputation hazardous, while danger of ultimate mortification intimidates us if we delay. Thus, you see, we have our professional Scylla and Charybides to steer through, and fortunate is he who can avoid both. But, my lord, do not for a moment suppose, because I place before you all the dangers which beset us, that therefore the chances are against the recovery of our patient. Has he not youth and a firm constitution? And while we see the feeble and tottering victim of age and disease resuscitated, the Lord forbid that we should despair of this young man's recovery.” With this information he again visited the bedside of his patient, who still slept, if that could be so termed which was the unquiet effect of powerful opiates. Scarce any one who had known Clifton in the flush of health and enjoyment, and who saw him now, would have believed that he and the pale and haggard being before him were one and the same person. No vestige of colour was visible in that cheek once so ruddy—the lips bore a wan and deathlike aspect—his raven hair lay lifelessly over his forehead; while the convulsive movement of the corners of his mouth indicated the pain which he was suffering. During the whole of that day, and the greater part of the succeeding night, neither Lord Templeton nor his eldest daughter ceased to exhibit the most intense anxiety for the fate of Clifton. Even the beautiful Euphemia, who, just blushing into early womanhood, was sportive and thoughtless as a young fawn, deeply sympathized with her more sedate sister, while the theme occupied her mind, but being at that happy period in life in which sunshine predominates, her spirits quickly bounded to more joyous impressions, and her expectations of a favourable issue were more confident and sanguine. Doctor Hildreth had peremptorily directed the nurse to exclude every person from visiting or conversing with the patient, but the anxious Miss Jerningham hovered like a good angel around the entrance to his chamber, and embraced every opportunity that offered to inquire into the particulars of his case, while the varying changes her beautiful countenance assumed during the day and evening, were a faithful index of her excited feelings. On learning from the nurse any symptom which she deemed important, either for good or ill, she hastened to her father, and communicated the facts, to learn his opinion of their nature and probable results. Clifton appeared during the day to exhibit every indication of extreme suffering; and the rapid pulse, inflamed and wandering eye, and confused intellect, bore witness to the dangerous character of his wound, and the uncertainty of its final issue. Although Lord Templeton was usually capable of commanding his feelings, yet his anxiety for Clifton was plainly visible, and he almost emulated his daughter's eagerness to learn each varying phase of the invalid's condition. In the morning the learned surgeon was again assailed by Lord Templeton and his daughters, whose impatience to ascertain Clifton's situation was manifest, no less by words than the expression of their countenances. To their great joy, the report was favourable. During the latter portion of the night, Clifton's rest had been less disturbed, and he awoke in the morning, extremely weak, but almost free from fever. Thus much Lord Templeton and his daughters gathered from the physician's report, whose native benevolence induced a ready reply, when its import was of so satisfactory a character. The interdiction against all intercourse with the patient was repeated with renewed emphasis, and all were too much rejoiced at the favourable prospect to murmur against a command enforced by so many important considerations. From that period, our hero's recovery slowly advanced, but several weeks elapsed before he could move with the aid of a crutch. When that period arrived, however, his recovery was much more rapid, from the favourable effect of air and exercise; and the approach of spring with its bland and cheering influences, although still lingering in the lap of winter, was sufficiently genial to awaken the dormant energies of his nature, and throw the rays of consolation along his chequered existence. To Lord Templeton, in confidence, he stated the unhappy result of his duel with Ellingbourne, which, for the present, rendered it desirable to keep his place of residence as much concealed as circumstances would admit. To this request the noble lord readily acceded, and although he severely censured the practice of duelling, he yet frankly admitted the difficulty which custom threw in the way of its suppression.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THOSE WITH WHOM IT IS DESIRABLE TO BE BETTER ACQUAINTED. “He, who is the theme of honour's tongue; Amongst a grove the very straightest plant; Who is sweet fortune's minion and her pride.” First part of King Henry 4th. Lord Templeton was descended from a long line of illustrious ancestors. Unlike many of his class, the splendour of his rank and title was more than reflected by the personal graces, virtue, and talents of their possessor. The death of his father left him, at an early period of his life, master of his own actions, and sole heir to a princely fortune; but a decided predilection for literary pursuits, and a taste for the beautiful in art and noble in nature, preserved him from all debasing associations, and directed his attention to more elevated objects than those which too often attract the regard and engross the time of the spoiled children of fortune. While travelling on the continent, he casually became the companion of a private gentleman, a resident of one of the remote counties in England, for whose beautiful and accomplished daughter he formed an ardent and lasting attachment. The young lady being equally fascinated with the talent and comeliness of her noble admirer, they were immediately united on their return to their native country. His daughters, Adeline and Euphemia, were the fruit of this union, over which no cloud of discontent or dissension ever lowered; but shortly after the birth of Euphemia, a rapid and irresistible decline consigned Lady Templeton to an early grave, leaving her fond husband for a long period inconsolable for his loss. True to his early and only attachment, his thoughts never wandered to the subject of a second marriage, but, secluded in his residence several miles from the city, and occupied with the education of his daughters and the necessary supervision of his large estates, he looked forward with calm composure to the time when, his children being settled in life and his earthly affairs satisfactorily arranged, his wearied spirit should wing its flight to that eternal home which contained the beloved of his soul. The congeniality of tastes between Clifton and himself resulted in a more unreserved intercourse and intimacy than the difference of rank and station would generally permit. More of his young guest's early history he would have been gratified to learn, but as Clifton had formally introduced the subject to his notice, and confidentially communicated all that Vol. II.—G he deemed desirable, delicacy prevented any farther allusion to a topic which the person, most interested, appeared to consider without the pale of friendly discussion. As Clifton's health became improved, the young ladies were added to the conversational circle, and the beauty, enthusiasm, and talents of the elder, with the artlessness and naïveté of her more youthful sister, aided materially in withdrawing his mind from the contemplation of its peculiar sorrows. Lord Templeton was perhaps more strongly attached to Miss Jerningham, the eldest, than to her sportive sister, much as he loved the latter, from her more striking resemblance to his departed lady. The pensive dark brown eye—the countenance playful, yet full of intelligence—the pale high forehead and ruby lips were all living remembrancers of her sainted mother. As weeks glided on, Lord Templeton did not fail to perceive, that the interest first awakened in himself and his family, by the service rendered them by his young guest, was daily gaining force, now that his talents and accomplishments were more fully developed; nor could he disguise from himself the probability that a more tender sentiment might arise in the breast of Miss Jerningham, if the handsome young American remained for a length of time under his roof, the companion of his daughters in their solitude, and a sharer in their recreations and amusements. As the noble lord had no sons to enjoy his title and entailed inheritance, and as the rank devolved on a distant relative, with whom he had never held personal intercourse, it is not to be denied that he looked forward to an alliance for one or both of his daughters, with a titled personage, as desirable and judicious. For rank itself, without merit, Lord Templeton entertained a humble estimate; nor did he consider a titled connection for his daughters of so paramount importance as to be willing to jeopard their happiness in securing it. With such sentiments, his objections to Miss Jerningham's possible attachment for Clifton was not, as may be supposed, founded entirely on his want of title or wealth. The prominent difficulty was in the mystery which veiled his career, and he felt that the veil must be removed before he could determine how far it would be expedient to waive his original intentions in relation to his daughter's future union, if her sentiments of esteem for our hero should ripen into love. With these views, it is not surprising that he attempted as much as possible to withdraw Clifton from the society of his daughter, lest her affections should be irrecoverably engaged. Had no suspicious circumstances occurred, subsequent to Clifton's confidential communication with Lord Templeton, on the subject of his reason for absenting himself from his native land, it is probable that the withheld development would have been considered unimportant; but an inadvertent inquiry by the artless Euphemia, as to the disease of which his parents died, on his stating the fact of their death, caused so manifest an embarrassment of manner, that it could not fail to challenge the attention of his host, and arouse suspicions of a painful nature. It was about this period that Clifton, one afternoon, while in the company of the young ladies, alluded to a celebrated poet, whose name was a household word in every corner of Europe, and as the only being on earth whom he really envied. This led to farther remark on the subject, which inadvertently caused him to admit the metrical sins of which he had himself been guilty. On hearing this confession, both his auditors claimed an example of his skill—Miss Jerningham blushing at the request after it was spoken, and Euphemia playfully enforcing her solicitation by holding up her finger in the attitude of mock command. With mischief and joy dancing in her laughing eye, she assured him that unless he took the earliest opportunity to display his poetical talents for their edification, he was no true knight-errant, notwithstanding his Quixotic attack and dispersion of three barbarians in their defence. To this demand on his gallantry, Clifton could not fail to respond, and accordingly on the following day the delighted Euphemia was greeted with the following playful apologue, entitled. CUPID'S REVENGE A lady fair one April day Stole Cupid's bow and quiver: The plundered urchin begged to learn What ransom he should give her. He proffered rank and tendered wealth— The lady's smile was sunny— She sportively the rank declined, Nor would accept the money. Unto his mother's court he flew, (This secret is between us,) Imploring counsel, power and aid, From sceptre-wielding Venus. The goddess summoned mighty Mars, His sword by peace was rusty: To Vulcan, then, her suit preferred, His negative was crusty! Dread Jupiter was next addressed, To claim the missing plunder: A trifle would the purpose serve— A bolt or two of thunder! The courteous god with ease replied, “I'd fain oblige you, you know, “But all my bolts are lent to-day To my beloved Juno.” The baffled goddess vainly roamed, From dewy morn till even;— No succour could her prayers command In ocean, earth, or heaven. Old Neptune vexed with feeble health Must loll in grotto shady; The rest declined (these were their words) To persecute a lady. G* With lengthened face poor Cupid now Returned to beg the favour, That if the lady still must keep What fickle fortune gave her:— She'd kindly loan the useless toys, Lest he his art should forget; In luckless moment she complied— Her breast became his target! In tears the stricken lady prays That he would draw his arrow: “Such wounds no gallant would inflict Even on a worthless sparrow:” He scornfully the boon denies; But soon is heard a carriage— Its inmate plucks the envious shaft; Who should it be but Marriage! His magic ring the pain expels,— Such wounds should ne'er be slighted:— Then vengeance sought upon the boy— Who fled away affrighted. Now all you ladies, far and near, Should wicked Love assail you, Call faithful Marriage to your aid, His ring will never fail you. Euphemia was no sooner in possession of her offering than she ran to her boudoir, and perused it with great glee. It was, she thought, so racy, and chimed so well with her playful feelings. Returning to the drawing-room, she could not keep the matter a secret, but skipping to her father's side exclaimed, “Guess, papa, what Mr. Clifton has given me. Now, Adeline, you must not give any of your hints, as I want papa to guess it without any help.” “Why, my love, that is more than I can divine. If Mr. Clifton has made you a present, I have no doubt it is such a one as was proper for him to bestow and you to receive.” This was said by Lord Templeton with great gravity, and the manner, more than the sentiment, first suggested the idea to Clifton, that his noble host deemed his longer intercourse with his daughters neither proper nor desirable. On the day previous, he had first succeeded in walking without the aid of a crutch, and this circumstance afforded a proper opportunity for the annunciation of his immediate departure. He therefore said:— “I should render a sad return for all the kindness bestowed upon me by your Lordship, could it enter into my imagination, to offer for your daughter's acceptance any other present than such a one as my sister might claim at my hands, had I the happiness to possess one. “As my health is quite restored, and I have succeeded in walking without the aid of my wooden supporter, I purpose returning, to-morrow, to my residence in the city; and, unhappily for my fame, in an evil hour I promised Miss Jerningham and her sister each a literary offering, before my departure. “As my word is pledged, I must, of course, fulfil the task as best I may, and Miss Euphemia's being the first completed, was this moment given.” “My excellent young friend,” said Lord Templeton, who observed with pleasure the delicacy of feeling which dictated Clifton's resolution, “you must not commit any such imprudence as returning to-your residence, while your health is still so feeble. No, no—a week or two hence we will permit you to talk about fixing the time of departure, but not yet. The thing is impossible. So, having settled that matter, we'll hear the poetical present recited.” Of course, all professed great admiration for the morceau. Euphemia said it was the prettiest effusion she ever read, except one or two of Moore's, and declared that she would keep it as long as she lived. Miss Jerningham archly remarked that she was pleased with the whole of it, except one idea. She did not like the assertion that marriage frightened away love. Clifton so far acceded to Lord Templeton's urgent solicitations as to consent to a few days addition to the time originally assigned for his departure. Both the young ladies, although they said nothing on the subject, evinced by their looks how grateful Clifton's stay was to their feelings. Lord Templeton from this period appeared entirely divested of his incipient apprehensions, in relation to Clifton's intercourse with his daughters; and as the lameness of our hero had so far decreased as to permit exercise on foot without much inconvenience, the extensive grounds attached to the mansion were visited in company with his lovely companions, Lord Templeton usually declining to partake of their rambling pleasures. It was now the month of March, and while the victim of consumption was wasting beneath its false and fickle smile, Clifton's health and spirits daily improved under the combined influence of spring and the conversational attractions of his fair auditors. As the visitor approached the mansion of Lord Templeton, through the lawn, he met the form of a lion rampant, which threw from its marble jaws a column of the pure element into the basin of an exquisitely chiselled fountain, of the same durable material. The beautifully decorated garden grounds were reached on passing through the great hall, and, half concealed by the budding foliage, urns and statues of bronze and marble, threw their classic witchery around the scene. A second fountain, of smaller dimensions, divided the gravelled walk in the centre of the garden, and on its skilfully wrought pedestal hovered the form of a massive eagle, which, with extended wings and parted beak, threw the liberated waters in showers over the area of the circular basin. At the extremity of the main avenue, after passing through a giant gateway, a lake of the purest water reflected on its mirror-like surface the varied phenomena of the heavens, while the well-beaten path that wound around its sedgy border frequently attracted our hero and his fair companions by its quiet and romantic loveliness. On the day previous to that on which Clifton proposed to depart for his residence in the city, Miss Jerningham reminded him of his promise to oblige her also with a specimen of his poetical ability; and as they were at that moment in the hall, and suspended before them on the wall hung an exquisite painting of a crusader setting out for Palestine—his hand on his charger's rein, Clifton selected it as the subject of the following effusion. THE CRUSADER TO HIS MISTRESS. With the folds of my banner unfurled to the wind, I leave the dear form of my lady behind: My foot in the stirrup—my hand on the rein, I conquer the Moslem or come not again. Though thy tears, my beloved, still tempt me to stay, My good steed impatient rebukes the delay: To the plains of Judea with ardour I fly, And thine eyes like bright Pleiades are lost from my sky. Dost thou view in the distance my legions advance? Fame mounts on each helmet, and death on each lance: From the harems of Selim shall rise a deep wail As the dirge of the chieftain floats sad on the gale. Bright gem of existence—enshrined in my heart, Oh weep not that glory commands us to part; Shall love cause thy warrior from honour to stray, When religion and valour both beckon away? I read thy reply in that love-beaming smile,— On the sands of Damascus its light will beguile, And when by its halo my sabre shall gleam, The blood of the foeman will crimson each stream. As the hills of Jerusalem rise on the view, And from cloud-kissing Hermon descends the soft dew— How fearful my trumpet defiance will roll To the dark-visaged infidel's terror-wrought soul. Now I bound in the saddle—my dearest, farewell— On no ear shall thy name with its melody swell; But how oft shall my eyes from the blue heaven glance To thy breeze-wafted pennon that floats from my lance. The following morning found Clifton on his way to the city, and the circle at Lord Templeton's could not conceal their regret at his absence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. SPRING.—THE RETURN.—A SUPERNATURAL VISITATION. “When with his lively ray the potent sun Has pierced the streams.” Thomson. “If I stand here I saw him.” Macbeth. Spring, with its dreamy influences, was again on the wing to the shores of merry England. True, its early glance, like the smile of virgin modesty, was tempered with a dash of frigidity; but who has not desired, in the innermost recesses of his heart, that both the type and the substance might inherit immortality; so fragrant are the flowers of enjoyment which are snatched from the brink of uncertainty! Twilight had descended upon the city with gentle and cautious footsteps, as if reluctant to dim the fading glories of the expiring day; and the vast crowd which poured along the streets of the metropolis, by their subdued voices and lighter tread, evinced their unconscious sympathy with the sweet and pensive hour. The discordant sounds which render London a second Babel during the day, were modulated, until they mimicked the solemn swell of the ocean, when the death-song of its complaining surges are faintly heard in the distance. Clifton's little study, of which he was again an occupant, overlooked the street, and directly opposite his window, a massive Gothic structure, with its pointed arches, towers, turrets, and battlements, looked down with a most protecting air on two diminutive modern erections which stood in humble attitude on either hand beneath its shadow. Seating himself near the window, he gazed listlessly on the moving panorama before him, until his thoughts became entirely absorbed in the contemplation of the varying events connected with his own sad destiny. As may be inferred, this reverie was ill calculated to secure mental or bodily repose; and unfortunately, recent circumstances had occurred to increase the gloom caused by those which threw their shadows permanently over his prospects. He had left the charming social circle at Lord Templeton's, and now felt, most poignantly, the loss of their sympathetic alleviation of his sorrows; and, on reaching the city, had been cruelly disappointed at receiving no letters from his friends in America. At De Lyle's suggestion, his foster-parents had determined not to forward any communications to his address, until a sufficient time had elapsed to allay the excitement of the public in relation to the Vol. II.—H duel with Ellingbourne; but this surely could not account for so protracted a silence. All these and a thousand other themes, in which melancholy was the predominant ingredient, passed through his mind with the speed of thought, until he came to the conclusion that he was especially singled out by untoward fate, as a victim to its most despotic and harrassing influences. To strengthen this idea, he dwelt on the fatal vision which agonized his mind on the night previous to his conflict with the robbers. Did not this conclusively prove that he was the sport of evil destiny? Just as his reflections had reached this gloomy point, the singular and hesitating manner of a pedestrian on the opposite side of the street, and directly beneath the portico of the Gothic building, arrested his attention. Although the evening was bland and lovely, yet a large Spanish cloak was wrapped closely around the individual in question, and by the manner in which he proceeded, it was evident that debility caused the hesitation of manner which first attracted Clifton's attention. The latter was about withdrawing his eyes, when, as the stranger passed beneath a gas-lamp, which threw a strong light on his face, Clifton, with horror, recognized the pale features of Julius Ellingbourne! At any other time, perhaps, he might have met as striking a resemblance to his unfortunate antagonist, without its exciting any superstitious feelings, but now, the ghost-like fac-simile of him he ha slain acted fearfully on his nerves, already weakened by the effects of his painful wound. “'Tis as I feared,” he said, musingly, to himself, “murder will have its victim, sooner or later. How haggard and death-like were his features! and methought he gazed up in my face with a threatening and terrific look, which froze my very blood. In my happy hours of boyhood, I sportively selected a star, and watched its bright course, until I became a convert to the dreams of the astrologer, and fancied that my fate was linked with its career. “Let me look on it now:—perchance it may corroborate or refute the gloomy view I have taken into futurity.” Thus saying, he sought out the sparkling luminary which, for a moment, shone with undiminished brilliancy. While he looked, a dark, but diminutive cloud, no larger than a lady's veil, was wafted by an unfelt breeze along the horizon, until it reached the luckless star over which it hovered, obscuring its beams and rendering it invisible. “The omen is complete!” sighed Clifton. “My career is approaching its close, and I may bid adieu to all the bright visions which, in years gone by, solaced and cheered me with their lustre! “Hereafter my existence will be like the bubble on the stream, which the slightest agitation of the waves of destiny will annihilate. “Farewell the anxious hope for a Name among the Deathless! Farewell the enchanting dream of a future union with Julia. A long farewell to that ambition which, like the eagle, nestled among the mountain-crags of Futurity—cradled by the thunder-cloud—companion of the sunbeam! Farewell to the sunny smile of affection—the warm grasp of friendship—the applause of the mighty in intellect. “Ye flowers of life that have here and there shed your fragrance over my path, farewell! Henceforth your thorns are alone to be my bitter inheritance!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT—A DAW IN BORROWED PLUMAGE. “You are of too quick a sight Not to discover which way your talent lies.” Roscommon. “Lest when the birds their various colours claim, Stripp'd of his stolen pride, the crow forlorn Should stand the laughter of the public scorn!” Francis. For several days subsequent to the occurrences narrated in our last chapter, Clifton's energies were depressed and his mind filled with gloomy forebodings; but he soon became convinced of the necessity of action, both from a conviction of its favourable effect on his spirits, and the demand for the means of subsistence, which now became imperative. Under this state of feeling, his next literary production was entitled “Fatality, or the Death Warning!” a tale, which for thrilling interest, deep pathos, and powerful delineation of human character, in those fearful moments when Reason totters on her throne, and Superstition hurls the sceptre from her grasp—almost rivalled the celebrated productions H* of the masters of the German school of literature. The sensation created in the public mind by its appearance, was remarkable. It was devoured with intense avidity by all classes, and the publishing office of the magazine in which it first saw the light was daily thronged with purchasers. Conjecture was busy in seeking to ascertain the author, and many and conflicting were the opinions of the knowing ones in such matters. One celebrated author whispered in the ear of all his friends, that he could divulge the secret if he would, but it must not be—at least for a time. “Oh,” said Miss Jemima Bluestocking, “I see through his reserve. He is himself the author. I can generally trace these mysteries through all their ramifications.” On the day succeeding this oracular declaration of Miss Bluestocking, Mr. Montblanque, the author alluded to, was met in St. James's Park by an acquaintance, who thus addressed him— “Montblanque, is thith you? 'Pon my thoul I'm glad to thee you. I'm told you know the author of `Fatality, or the Death Warning.' I thall conthider it pothitively unkind—I thall, on my honour—if you refuthse to tell me in confidenth. You know, my dear fellow, I'm clothse asth Motheth the utherer, and asth thrusty asth hith iron chesth. Tho, my dear Montblanque, do rethore the equilibrium of my mind, which hath been thockingly agitated sinth thith confounded thecret hath been in the wind.” The speaker was Elton Arabesque, one of the most noted of the race of exquisites. His attire was in the most approved mode, and as he moved along, the “observed of all observers,” the air was redolent of perfume. While addressing Montblanque he elevated a quizzing-glass to his eye, gently threw forward the right leg, and attitudinized most imposingly. Whether his lisp was natural or affected was a question which was still mooted among his friends; and so high ran the controversies on this interesting subject, that they resulted in three challenges being passed—one of which ripened into a veritable duel. Whether the weapons were charged with leaden or pomatum bullets was the theme of another series of disputes, which were fortunately settled by the interference of mutual friends. “Mr. Arabesque,” replied the litterateur, “I beg you will not press that question any farther. When I tell you that I have refused to hold any conversation on this subject with my devoted friend Lord Fitzweller, you can judge the delicacy of my position, and how impossible it is for me to enter into any explanation that can, in the remotest degree, contribute to withdraw the mask which the author, whoever he may be, has seen fit to assume. So, with your permission, we will talk on some other topic. You perceive my embarrassment, and no doubt appreciate my feelings. You know I am the last man in the world to covet laurels which should deck other brows; and if you should hear Miss Bluestocking hereafter allude to my name in connection with this production, do me the favour to state distinctly that I decline avowing any claim to the honours awarded the unknown author.” “Oh, I pertheive. I sthmoke the thecret. I take. I'm dumb. I am, pothitively. Not a word of your being the author. I'll look knowing; but on my honour the thecret's thafe.” “But, my dear Mr. Arabesque, you'll really believe me, when I say I must not be considered the author of `Fatality.' ” “Yeth. Yeth, I underthand. You're non-committal. Good bye, Montblanque—good bye. I'm a walking thtatue of thilence—I am, pothitively.” And thereupon this butterfly without wings buzzed the supposed secret into the ear of every acquaintance who crossed his path, in the strictest confidence; adding that his friend Montblanque would be savage if he knew that he divulged it. In this way the worthy Montblanque contrived to reap what he had not sown; taking especial care to so fortify himself with saving clauses in his conversations, that if the real author chose to avow himself, he could refer to positive declarations in which he disavowed the authorship. Oh Charlatanism—thou modern divinity—we recognize in thee the dispenser of more than life and death! At thy nod nations bow with reverence; and wo be to him who in an evil hour rebels against thy government, and sets at nought thy edicts. Let him at once repent his temerity, ere thy chariot wheels crush him to powder. Are not thy disciples seated in the high places of power? Who now dares with sacrilegious hand to profane the memory of thy departed ministers? Do not the pupils of thy Hahnemann—the apostles of thy Spurzheim—the successors of thy St John Long—swarm like locusts over the land—each one with a train of followers at his heels, which, in numbers, would throw the disciples even of Daniel O'Connell himself into the shade! Again we repeat, all hail Charlatanism! Like Byron, our hero “awoke one morning, and to his surprise, found, if not himself, at least his production famous.” And did he turn a deaf ear to the praises awarded his literary offspring? Assuredly not. His first impulse was to consider the plaudits of the multitude as a part of the heartless pageant in which he considered himself no longer an actor, and whose praise or censure it was equally his duty to disregard. That he was the victim of a resistless and remorseless destiny was his firm conviction, and he considered every effort to escape its decrees both futile and absurd. To repent of his crime in destroying the life of Ellingbourne, and to prepare for futurity, were now his paramount duties. But as days passed, and his mind became divested of a portion of its morbid apprehensions, his interest in the scenes around him returned, until at length he could no longer disguise from himself the truth that the voice of fame was music to his ears; and like a war horse at the blast of the trumpet, his spirit bounded to the call of a whole people who unitedly demanded that he should again exhibit his powers in the literary arena. Then first fell in all its gloom across his mind the dark shadow which ever attends early success in the literary world—the dread of failure—where not to soar yet higher is to sink! True, the fame attending his successful effort yet rested on a masked brow, but the sweet conviction of ultimate triumph in an open arena, where the combatants should be divested of their visors, was cherished not the less that it was still unrealized by himself. With such feelings he proceeded to the task of perfecting another specimen of what his intellectual powers were capable of creating; and many were the erasures, interlinings, and additions, which the composition underwent, from its early inception until it came forth in a dress deemed fit for the public eye. Being persuaded, from the success of his late effort, that the pathetic and the mysterious were calculated more fully to display his powers than any other species of composition—as they entered with more force into his present feelings—he again essayed to unveil the subtle connection which existed between the Past, the Present, and the Future, by delineating the remorse that tortured the bosom of the guilty—peopling the Present with the grim images of the Past, and throwing over the Future the dark shadows of them both. This tale was entitled the “Conscience Stricken,” and so eager were the public to possess it, that an immense edition of the magazine in which it appeared—being quadruple the number usually issued—was absorbed in a day. To his great joy, the papers united in pronouncing it a more able and powerful effort than its predecessor, while the controversy as to its paternity waxed warmer and more angry. Behold our hero on the high road to celebrity:— but was he more happy now that the fiery ordeal was passed? Did the breath of public applause appease the cravings of a spirit, conscious of its mighty and mysterious powers? There were moments when it failed to soothe his wounded spirit; and the bitter reflection that the fair fabric would tumble in ruins, if the authorship was avowed and his history exposed, dashed the cup of enjoyment from his lips. And even if his former disgrace could be effectually concealed from the British public, who was to be the partaker of his new-born honours? Would the loud trump of fame sound conviction of his innocence to the bosom of Julia's parents? The idea was madness. To what purpose, then, was he pouring forth the treasures of a rich intellect? Like the Eastern pearl-diver, he had descended to the innermost recesses of his soul, and though precious were the gems which sparkled in his casket, they were valueless to their possessor. Monarch of the hour, his sceptre, like that of the Ice King, waved over a region of eternal snows, unblessed by the genial beams of love, or the sunny smile of friendship. Such were his meditations in periods of mental gloom; but their influence on his spirits daily declined, and more philosophical and enlarged views and feelings resumed their empire over his heart. Again returned the consciousness that he possessed an immortal soul, invested with noble attributes; and while dwelling on its high destinies he estimated the world's opinion of his guilt or innocence, at its real value. When in this judicious mood of mind he would retire to rest with calm reliance on the goodness of Providence; and, forgetting the unprofitable studies of the astrologer, would enter the dominions of sleep, prepared to partake of its holy and serene enjoyments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. A NEW CHARACTER—EPICUREAN ENJOYMENTS. DIPLOMACY MADE EASY. “Teach me, like thee, in various nature wise, To fall with dignity, with temper rise; Form'd by thy converse, happily to steer, From grave to gay, from lively to severe; Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease, Intent to reason, or polite to please.” Pope. “Fill high the sparkling bowl, The rich repast prepare.” Gray. The exciting occupations and events of the few days which had elapsed since Clifton's return from Lord Templeton's, had prevented him from presenting a letter of introduction with which that nobleman had furnished him to the Honourable Lucius Courtenay, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States, near the Court of St. James. Indeed, when first offered, he hesitated in accepting it, but as Lord Templeton had frequently expressed great regard for the Minister, and had voluntarily presented him with the Vol II.—I letter when he was leaving his hospitable mansion, courtesy required its early delivery. It now occurred to his mind, that an introduction to the representative of his native country, might facilitate the receipt of advices from his friends in New-York, and he therefore determined to avail himself of his noble friend's introduction. At a suitable hour, Clifton visited the residence of the ambassador, presented his letter, and was received with great cordiality by the gentleman, who informed him that he had, when a boy, resided in the city of New-York;—adding, that he trusted to have the pleasure of his company the next day at dinner. This friendly invitation our hero declined, on the plea of ill health; but on Mr. Courtenay's assurance that he should be at perfect liberty to withdraw whenever he deemed it prudent, while his recent recovery would present a legitimate plea for his abstemiousness, he at length reluctantly consented. “You will meet a very select, although somewhat unique, circle of my diplomatic, literary, and scientific friends, and I promise you an intellectual banquet, which will be not the less relished, that some of the dishes are rather highly spiced. You must know that I am a bachelor, and will perceive that I am rather young for a diplomatist; but, like the captain of one of our most successful packet ships, who boasted, that it was only necessary for him to give her the proper direction when leaving Sandy Hook, as she knew the road as well as he did—so I may, with truth, declare, that the direct policy of our government in its intercourse with foreign nations, renders skill and experience comparatively useless auxiliaries to our ambassadors, who require prudence and integrity alone in their negotiations. As this is the best excuse that can be offered for the selection of my poor self, I trust you will consider it in as favourable a light as your conscience will permit.” The latter part of these remarks was delivered with a smile, and Clifton parted from the ambassador with feelings of high gratification. While conversing with Mr. Courtenay, he could not resist the conviction that they had met before, but the circumstances of their former intercourse—if such had existed—were blotted from his memory, and he at length concluded, that the apparent recognition of his countenance was caused by a striking resemblance to some individual of his acquaintance, whom it was, for the moment, impossible to designate. On the following day Clifton joined the social circle at the hospitable mansion of Mr. Courtenay, which, in addition to the host, consisted of Prince Ptolenski, charge d'affairs from the court of St. Petersburgh—Count Rosini, ambassador from the Grand Duke of Tuscany—Theophilus Elgin, esquire, recently returned from a tour through Egypt, Asia, Turkey in Europe, and the Grecian Isles in the Archipelago—and Stewart Macartney, a celebrated author and antiquary, from the renowned city of Edinburgh. After the cloth was removed, Mr. Courtenay sportively proposed the “health of his new guest, Mr. Clifton, who, like Richard the Lion-hearted, by the might of his single arm, had put to flight two modern Saracens and captured a third—while, more fortunate than the Royal Crusader, he rescued Beauty and Innocence from the grasp of the infidels.” The explanation of course followed, but Clifton, on returning thanks, begged permission to decline appropriating the compliment in its full extent. “Our host,” he remarked, “is so versed in the beauties of ancient and modern lore, that he contrives to throw over the most common-place incident the lustre of his vivid imagination. Lest I should be unduly honoured, it is proper to state that the affair to which my friend alludes was as unromantic and common-place as can well be imagined; being nothing more than an almost accidental encounter with some cowardly vagabonds, who lacked the courage to execute what their villanous hearts had planned.” “Decline neither the compliment nor the illustration,” said Mr. Elgin, gravely; “for happy would it be for the young men of the present day if they would equally emulate the chivalric spirit manifested by yourself in the rescue of Lord Templeton, and the intimate acquaintance with the history of the glorious of ancient days which has caused Mr. Courtenay to tender so apt and faithful a comparison.” “You see Mr. Clifton,” said the author from beyond the Tweed, “that you can no more unbind the laurels which are wreathed around your brow, than the captured assassin could escape from your strong hand. By the way, Mr. Courtenay, can you enlighten our mental darkness by unmasking the author of the two able productions whose appearance has lately thrown the literary public into such a ferment of curiosity?” “I am not capable of even forming a conjecture. The only name I have heard suggested was that of Montblanque, but I consider the rumour highly improbable.” “Not improbable, but impossible,” replied Mr. Macartney. “I know his style perfectly, and cannot trace the least resemblance. We all know that his manner is affected and egotistical, while that of the unknown author is plain, simple, and natural. The whole charm of the first—if charm it can be termed—consists in its elaborate and artificial polish, while the latter enchains the attention by the force and truth of his masterly delineations. Faults there are in the new productions, but they are the result of haste and inattention, which can, and I have no doubt will, be remedied, if the writer continues to pursue the career he has so successfully commenced. As every person ventures a conjecture on this subject, I will follow the example so far as to prophecy I* that when the secret is divulged the honours will be worn by some hitherto untried champion.” “How do you like the mystical region in which the author essays his new-fledged wing?” said Mr. Courtenay. “Your question is difficult to answer. If the mental powers of the artist are equal to his task, the sublimity and elevation of the subject impart a legitimate interest to its analyzation which cannot fail to enlighten while it charms. If, on the contrary, a feeble writer attempts to disentangle intricacies to which his powers are inadequate, he leads his ignorant readers into a labyrinth of inconsistencies, which is apt to result in either credulity or scepticism. On the whole, it is perhaps doubtful whether the mystical tales and romances, and the metaphysical discussions of the present century have not contributed rather to vitiate than to elevate the public taste. But Mr. Clifton has not yet ventured an opinion on the grave question, who is the anonymous writer of `Fatality.' ” “When Mr. Macartney is informed that I claim no pretensions to necromancy, he will acquit me of any attempt to unravel a mystery which the present distinguished company have failed to penetrate.” “A compliment, most decidedly,” said Prince Ptolenski. “Come, come,” said Count Rosini, “we'll drop a thread-bare theme to discuss one that's ever new By Bacchus, it warms my very soul to inhale the aroma of this iced champaign. Even in Italy—my own Italy—have our exquisite wines been thrown in shadow by this charming foreigner. Elgin, I pledge thee. May thy last resting-place be in some sunny vale of the Campagna, with the luscious fruit of which this is the essence, and the dew bending gracefully over it.” “'Tis a goodly wish, and gracefully tendered,” replied the orientalist, “and far be from me the churlishness which hesitates to return so friendly a pledge. “I have scarcely tasted the equal of this since my ever-to-be-remembered visit to the Pyramids. My escort was a portion of the body guard of Mehmet Ali, and the butler of his Highness presented me with a choice specimen of Egyptian taste, in the shape of a dozen of exquisite Maraschino, remarking with an arch look that I might as well enjoy the contents, as they were considered contraband by the Mahommedan creed. I reserved the precious gift until the Pyramids were reached, when, by Jove, my turbaned companions came near swallowing the bottles after the taste was ventured. “'Twas delicious, and added to the inspiration of the time and place. I have rarely enjoyed the equal of that hour.” “So, so,” said the Count Rosini, smiling, “we now can duly appreciate the character of the new hieroglyphics, the discovery of which has created such a sensation in literary and scientific circles. I trust that the bottle was not the microscope through which they were viewed? By the cestus of Minerva this must be looked to.” “You forget `in vino veritas,' ” said the sententious representative of Russian majesty. “Why, Count, you worse than heathen, to doubt my authority on matters of this sort. Were you an Englishman I might pardon the jest, but for a native of Italy—land of the beautiful in nature and exquisite in art—land of brilliant recollections—over whose past glory we mourn as of a bright Pleiad lost from the sky—for you to bandy jests on a subject connected with associations sublime as those which cluster around your own loved land!—the thing's monstrous, foul and unnatural.” “But we have almost forgotten our duty to our worthy host. Mr. Courtenay permit me to pledge you in a glass of Burgundy. May your shadow never be less.” “If that same wish should inadvertently be tendered to our friend Malvoisin, who weighs three hundred and ninety pounds avoirdupois, both the desire and its fulfilment would I fear be considered mal-apropos,” said Mr. Macartney. “But,” said Mr. Courtenay, “my friend Clifton has recently left New-York, and I must be permitted to make some inquiries concerning its prospects and the changes which eighteen years must have made in its appearance. At that time Canal-street, on the north side, was the highest point which contained a thickly settled population.” “The changes in that period have been great. The compact portion of the city extends for miles above Canal-street, and the buildings comprised in the new section are incomparably the most beautiful and highly finished. Although the trade of London is so much greater than that of New-York, yet the entrance to the latter presents a much more imposing array of shipping than its gigantic rival; from the fact that in this city they are scattered, and encased in dry docks, while in New-York the whole are visible at a glance.” “And Broadway, I suppose, has also increased in attraction?” “Certainly. It is now paved and closely built upon for nearly four miles. On pleasant days the throng of carriages and pedestrians which pour along its pavements and side-walks is immense, and whatever of beauty and fashion we possess is fairly represented on such occasions in Broadway.” “I should like to revisit the scenes of my boyish gambols. The palace has no doubt usurped the site of my former humble habitation, and enterprise, like Midus, transmuted the very earth into gold.” Here the minister sighed, and for a moment was pensive. “True,” replied Clifton, “but unhappily our national prosperity has engendered an inordinate desire of gain, which pervades all ranks in society, until heaven-born Genius descends from its native eyry to join the debasing strife which ever follows the footsteps of cupidity.” “I coincide with you in the sentiment,” rejoined Mr. Courtenay, “but somewhat doubt the correctness of its application. Cupidity is the vice of the age rather than the peculiar attribute of the American people. Man has in all ages reared some idol before whom the mass offered incense; and since war has doffed his helmet, and military glory ceased to dazzle, wealth, with its handmaid splendour, is the popular divinity. That the worship of this baseborn goddess has drawn down some bright spirits from the heaven of intellect, is unquestionable, and like the fallen angels, their energies, equally potent for evil as for good, lend an artificial lustre to pursuits which in their essence are vicious and degrading. “But young America can yet boast of luminaries whose steady effulgence has irradiated the hemisphere of literature, and penetrated the regions of science and of art.” “For my own part,” remarked Mr. Macartney, “I am half disposed to defend the world's estimation of literary pursuits, little as I expect to become a practical illustrator of their theory. Much as I delight in the development of those mental and physical objects which glow and sparkle beneath the plastic hand of their delineator, I must at times admit that fame is an ignus fatuus which lures only to betray. “When, after great mental exertion, my nerves are unstrung, my energies depressed and my fancy incapable of conjuring up one bright image, I sit listlessly and reflect that I am in pursuit of a phantom which withers the powers of manhood and repels the hope of a green old age, I feel that the shadowy reward is dearly earned, and almost envy the worldling his unintellectual enjoyments.” “If I might venture an opinion in opposition to such well-established authority,” said Clifton, “I should doubt whether the votary of wealth enjoys the repose you award him. “While in the acquisition of gain, his hopes and fears are continually excited, until sleep is frequently banished from his couch, and care and anxiety plough their furrows prematurely on his brow. And even when he has amassed a sufficiency, and attempts to enjoy the otium cum dignitate of retirement, his former pursuits unfit him for either solitude or social intercourse, and you behold him the victim of inanity and mental idleness, dragging out a weary existence—unblessing and unblessed. Contrast with this the bright visions which visit the solitary study of the child of genius, until they become a part and parcel of his existence—throwing over the most common-place subjects which glows beneath his touch the combined charms of fancy and reality—impelling him, like Pygmalion, to become enamoured of the grace, beauty, and majesty of his own creation, and causing him to repine at the thought that he cannot bid it leap into life and return his warm embrace. Oh the exquisite sense of enjoyment which follows the first successful flight into the regions of fancy and invention. Like first love it visits the soul but once. Memory consecrates it in her baptismal font—nor can after sorrow—or poverty—or despair efface the impress from our hearts” “In faith,” said the mercurial Italian Count, “I begin to suspect that our trans-atlantic friend is an author in disguise. Who knows whether we are not indebted to him for the celebrated productions which are setting all London by the ears?” “If I were that invisible personage I fear a removal of the mask would effectually quench the public enthusiasm,” said Clifton, blushing at the truth of the random shot; “nothing takes like mystery.” “You are right,” returned the Count. “Years since, while passing a convent near Genoa, I caught a glimpse of a lady in a veil, walking pensively in a garden attached to the ancient structure. My fancy instantly converted the damsel into a beauty in distress, and I remained watching her movements until she disappeared beneath the gloomy arches of her prison-house. The next day found me hovering near the scene of her solitary musings—like the spirits of the departed around the confines of Elysium, until she again appeared. In a few moments, on stooping to tie her slipper, I perceived a foot whose diminutive and well-moulded proportions would have captivated the heart of a Chinese emperor. “This completed the spell, and the next moment found me at the foot of the wall, affixing to a small stone a most pathetic invitation to the fair incognito, to leave the convent in my company—stating that if she would but appear at the same point, I would at midnight be prepared with a fleet steed to bear her to a safe and honourable retreat. Hurling the missive and letter over the wall, I glided behind the thick foliage and remained for a time quiet, lest some intruder might have detected the attempt at communication. At the appointed hour I was on the ground equipped for flight; and the first salutation I received was the grasp of three stout monks, whom my incognito, the Abbess, aged fifty, had stationed to seize me. With unfeigned contrition I begged for quarter, which was after a time granted; and even unto this day the sight of a veiled beauty is repugnant to my feelings. If the world was of my way of thinking the wand of mystery would be hereafter powerless.” “And yet,” said Mr. Elgin, “mystery is the parent of knowledge. What attracted my footsteps to the Egyptian shores, and caused the visit to her time-defying Pyramids? Mystery. What induced me to hang with rapture over those beautiful productions of art which ancient Greece has preserved —the relics of ages lost even to tradition? To Vol. II.—K penetrate the mystery that surrounds them. What impelled a Galileo to investigate the laws that govern the systems of which our globe is the centre, and brave persecution in defence of his theory? Mystery. This being the case, my dear Count, never rail at mystery again.” “I stand rebuked,” replied the good-natured Count. “But a truce to metaphysics. What say you, gentlemen, to a song?” “Mr. Courtenay must I think be taxed for its production. Gentlemen the call is peremptory.” “With your permission, gentlemen, I'll amend the motion, by soliciting Mr. Clifton to sing in my stead,” replied Mr. Courtenay. “Unfortunately for my fame in the social circle, my voice is incapable of warbling forth sweet sounds.” “Whatever may be my defects, either in voice or execution, they will not prevent the attempt to amuse this goodly company,” was Clifton's reply, and he accordingly sang the following SERENADE. Wake! lady, wake! the crescent moon Crowns Ida's regal brow, And Hudson's mirrored breast is bathed In liquid radiance now! O'er giant Catskill's throne of clouds The stars their vigils keep— Then, lady, lift the envious veil That shrouds thine eyes in sleep. Rise! lady, rise! night's sombre train At thy approach will flee; But moon-beams smile and planet's ray Are darkness without thee. My voiceless lute in vain essays To trill love's honeyed words, If from thy lips no answering tone Is breathed among the chords. I view thy lattice—bars unfold— Thy footstep lingers near: Fond trembler lull those feverish throbs, No ill can reach thee here. My shallop bounds upon the wave— Its light sail woos the wind; Rest! lady, rest! thy lover's arms Are round thy form entwined. Wit, sentiment and good humour regined at the festive board during Clifton's stay, and he left impressed with respect for his kind host and his friends. As he reached his residence he turned to take a last look at the heavens glittering with myriads of stars—but as his glance was momentarily directed to the opposite side of the street—behold, beneath the lamp again appeared the form of Ellingbourne—his pale countenance and its haggard expression more striking than before. Clifton but looked, and with a shriek, fell senseless on the threshold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE TRIAL—AN UNLOOKED FOR INCIDENT. “For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty.” Merchant of Venice. Several days had elapsed after the supernatural visitation of Ellingbourne to the horror-stricken view of his slayer, before the latter could summon sufficient energy to venture again into the crowded thoroughfare of the great city. The trial of the culprit for the attempted robbery of Lord Templeton, was announced for an early day, and it therefore became necessary for Clifton, who was the principal witness, to rouse himself from the mental stupor which succeeded the first convulsive agitation of his overwrought system, and prepare to pass through the trying ordeal of a rigid cross examination, confronted by that array of official dignitaries, which renders an English judicial tribunal so imposing to the eye of a stranger. The London daily press—ever eager to minister to the public taste for the marvellous, had dilated with great apparent satisfaction on the chivalrous conduct of our hero, who, according to their statements, performed feats of personal prowess, which would have eclipsed the fame of Goliath of Gath, in the palmy days of his strength. Add to this, the audacious nature of the attack— the desperate attempt of the criminal on Clifton's life—the elevated rank of the noble prosecutor— the romantic rescue of the young ladies—and the mystery which was supposed to envelope our hero, from his name being withheld—all of which were duly chronicled and commented on; and we need not be surprised that he should, as the day of trial approached, experience a degree of excitement unknown to the mass of residents of the great metropolis,—who, intent on their multitudinous pursuits,— scarcely paused to mark either the advent, progress, or consummation of criminal proceedings of a far more extraordinary description. True there are, in London, as in all overgrown communities, a sufficient number of individuals who, from various causes, are prone to linger around the precincts of the criminal courts, and who appear to enjoy the uncertainty and hazard which surround the accused. To these may be added the unemployed mechanic, who is fain to while away an idle hour in listening to the eloquence of the learned counsel, or the wisdom of the equally learned judge— the traveller, who desires to become acquainted with the forms of judicial tribunals in a strange land— K* and the scattered troop of idlers who, having no precise object in view, happen to have their attention arrested while passing by the court-room—and it will readily be inferred, that a large auditory is frequently congregated, without the concurrence of extraordinary circumstances. At length the eventful day arrived, and a large crowd were assembled in the immediate vicinity of the hall in which the criminal was to encounter the ordeal of a public trial. Here and there might be seen groups of loiterers, who were discussing the probabilities of guilt or innocence—of condemnation or acquittal—while others were dwelling on topics of more immediate personal interest—or occupied in the laudable object of settling the affairs of the nation. Equality, if not liberty, was, for the time being, conspicuous, for the millionaire was elbowed by the footman, and the scion of nobility relinquished the trottoir to his tailor's shop boy. “Mr. Jones,” remarked a brawny, and rather negligently than ill-dressed mechanic to his neighbour, “do you think the fellow what's accused of robbery by Lord Templeton will have a fair trial?” “I mis-doubt it confoundedly. The aristocracy have too much power over men as good as good as themselves, to give a poor devil fair play for his life.” “But you forget, Thomson, that the jury are composed of men like ourselves, and they certainly won't be unjust and condemn an innocent man. If the fellow is really guilty, then hang him, say I, for if he's permitted to go at large, he, and such as he, may knock you or me down in the streets, next, without our being able to obtain redress.” The speaker was also a mechanic, whose shrewd and good-humoured countenance was both English and pleasing—which some persons may consider as incompatible. His dress was of rather coarse materials, but neat and becoming; and there was that undefinable display of manly, yet modest independence in his manner, which would at once convince the beholder, that he was in the presence of one whose industry, sobriety, and moral habits insured to their possessor a comfortable subsistence for himself and family. “Ay, ay,” was the answer, “if he's guilty, he must swing, I s'pose—but somehow I can't believe it yet. Mr. Pennifeather, the attorney that speaks at our meetings, says, that he'll lay a wager that the man that's taken up is innocent, and the man that's going to swear against him is one of the gang. Because, says Mr. Pennifeather—says he—if the witness is an honest man why didn't he tell his name? Depend on't, Mr. Jones, the real rascal will go clear and the innocent man be jerk'd up. These lords and dukes never miss when they aim at a poor man.” “Well, well,” was the reply, “let's wait and see. If the man is not guilty, I don't believe an honest jury or upright judge, will wish to condemn him. For my part, I can't think of any motive they can have to do so. Remember, we must have charity for the judge and jury, as well as the prisoner.” The further conversation of these individuals was prevented by the annunciation which ran through the crowd, that the doors of the court room were opened. Those interested from any cause in the trial pressed forward in the van to procure an eligible situation for listening to its details—while those accidentally placed in advance did not fail to defend their position, although totally indifferent to the fate of the accused. The little bickerings thus created served to elicit the notice of the peace officers in attendance,—who in humble imitation of their betters in high places took summary measures to crush rebellion against authority in its incipient stages. Such of the crowd as desired admittance were at length seated, while those whose curiosity was satisfied with a view of the officials of all grades as they passed, wended their way in pursuit of new objects of interest. And now the judges appeared in their robes of office—the counsel for the crown and the advocate of the accused entered with their briefs—Lord Templeton and Clifton were seated within the bar— the crier recited his usual monotonous harangue— the prisoner, pinioned and guarded by the officers of justice, was placed in the dock—the jury were duly impannelled, and all the usual preliminaries gone through. After the arraignment of the accused, who answered to the name of Abel Watson, the counsel for the crown arose, and the low hum which was before audible throughout the room was instantly hushed into profound silence. With great dignity of manner the learned gentleman addressed the court. “My lord, and you gentlemen of the jury: I rise to discharge a painful, but imperative public duty. No one who is acquainted with the natural impulses of my heart, will discredit me when I assert that I always commence the trial of a capital offence, burthened and oppressed with the magnitude of the stake to the unfortunate culprit, and fearfully conscious of the awful responsibility it is my official duty to assume. But, gentlemen of the jury, if on the one hand the fate of the prisoner—hanging as it were by a thread—should warn us against admitting into our bosom that prejudice, or delusion which may operate to produce unjust conviction; an equal regard for the obligations imposed on us as members of society, should prevent the sway of that hesitation or weakness, which sends forth the hardened criminal to renew his depredations on the lives and property of virtuous citizens: thus rendering the innocent the prey of the guilty, and reversing the laws that protect every well-regulated community. The charge which I am prepared to substantiate against the prisoner at the bar is that of highway robbery, committed under peculiarly aggravated circumstances, on a distinguished member of the peerage, whose elevated mind and pure morality give lustre to his station, and make him the favourite of his tenantry, and the idol of a select social circle. “Fortunately for Lord Templeton and his accomplished daughters, their defender, who is a distinguished American, heard their cries, and courageously and successfully attacked the robbers— pinning the prisoner at the bar to the earth; and although dangerously wounded, retaining his grasp until aided by the noble Lord and others, who opportunely arrived at the spot. “If, gentlemen of the jury, I shall prove these facts to your satisfaction, there can be no alternative: a verdict of guilty, is as inevitable as it is just.” While the counsel for the crown was opening the case, the censorious Mr. Thomson remarked to his friend Jones: “Do you hear how he praises Lord Templeton, by calling him a distinguished member of the peerage? This is a trap to catch flats in. I think for my part that the fellow in the dock looks as honest as my Lord Templeton. “If I didn't know either of them, I should full as soon secure my pocket-book in a crowd if he came too near, as I would if the prisoner drew up along side.” “Well, well,” replied Jones, “there's no accounting for difference of opinion. I thought the prisoner had as hang-dog and cut-throat a look as I ever saw. Why, certainly Thomson, you must be joking, when you compare his scowling and savage face to the open countenance of Lord Templeton. But see, that nobleman is about being sworn.” Lord Templeton stated briefly the circumstances connected with the attempt at robbery, and was dismissed from the stand without cross-examination. As Clifton ascended the witnesses' stand, a decidedly favourable impression was made by his lofty brow, intellectual eye, and graceful carriage; but the difficult Mr. Thomson was not among the number of his admirers. “He's too prim by half,” was his exclamation; “I shouldn't wonder if he was a genteel roadster.” The testimony of Clifton corroborated that of Lord Templeton in all essential particulars; but as the reader is already apprised of the main features of the transaction, it is unnecessary to enter into farther detail. When his direct testimony was concluded, the counsel for the prisoner proceeded to the cross-eamination. “Pray sir,” said he to Clifton, “can you state under the solemnity of an oath, that the prisoner might not, like yourself, have been attracted to the spot by the cries of the assailed party? And can you swear that the pistol was not discharged before he came up?” “There is certainly a bare possibility that such was the case, but my impressions are, that he is the individual who first discharged fire arms.” “We want facts, not impressions. I will thank you to confine your answers to the point. Was not the confusion great, and might not a robber have discharged the pistol and retreated, and the prisoner have appeared on the spot, during the time between the discharge of the weapon and your attack on the prisoner?” “Such might have been the case, although the movement must have been performed with great rapidity. My reason for stating my impression as to the identity of the prisoner is, that he is about the size of the person who discharged the first weapon.” “Did I not understand you to state that the night was very dark? How then could you distinguish the height of the individual who fired?” “By the flash of his weapon, which exposed the outline of his person.” “So, sir, I am to understand that in a dark night, with no other light than the flash of a pistol, you could at several yards distance so far identify the prisoner, as to be willing to swear away his life?” “My reply is, that I found the prisoner by the side of the coach, certainly not in the attitude or position of a defender of the assailed party—that after I felled him to the earth he gave no explanation which led me to believe him innocent—and I have no reason to doubt his participation in the robbery.” “Most persons,” replied the foiled counsel, “would, like my client, have been silent after being stunned by a blow which levelled them with the earth; and afterwards confronted by a posse whose looks and actions condemned them in advance. But, sir, one more question. Are you a native of this country?” “No, sir: my birth-place is the city of New-York.” “Have you parents residing there?” “My parents are long since dead.” “How long?” “It is many years since they died.” “Will the court be good enough to note the witness's answer? he states that his parents are many years dead.” Here the evidence for the prosecution closed. The counsel for the prisoner, in opening the defence, briefly adverted to the lonely and unprotected condition of his client, who found himself unexpectedly charged with a crime at which his soul revolted. He described the accused as an honest, sea-faring man, whose calling and humble station in life prevented him from bringing into requisition the influence of friends, or that evidence of former good character which so frequently shielded the innocent, and not unfrequently rescued the guilty from merited punishment. Vol. II.—L. In addition to the innate justice of his cause, he was prepared to impeach the testimony of the witness, Clifton, and to show that he could not be relied on for the conviction of the prisoner for a capital offence. The learned gentleman stated his solemn conviction that the appearance of his client on the scene of the attempted robbery was caused by the outcries of the assailed party, and that his intentions were to aid Lord Templeton, in which he was foiled by the violent assault of Mr. Clifton. “But,” said he, “even the last witness, anxious as you perceive he is to establish this charge, states that he cannot say with certainly that the prisoner was not in the act of rescuing instead of assailing the noble lord and his family. The circumstance of finding a discharged pistol near his person, is by no means inconsistent with his innocence, as the robber would naturally have been standing at the door of the carriage, while the darkness of the night gave him an opportunity of escaping unobserved after the unsuccessful attempt at assassination. Thus, gentlemen of the jury, you will perceive that a conviction, under all the circumstances of this case, would be a fearful precedent to establish, while the blood of my client would be demanded at your hands.” The counsel here called James Lloyd to the stand. “Mr. Lloyd,” said he, “do you know Sydney Clifton, the witness who last testified?” The witness, who was dressed in the garb of a seaman, and apparently about thirty years of age, replied in the affirmative. “How long have you known him, and where?” “It is several years since I have known him by sight. I was formerly before the mast in a ship belonging to Howard, De Lyle &amp; Co., for whom Mr. Clifton was clerk.” “Do you know whether he has parents now living?” “His father was the cartman of Howard, De Lyle &amp; Co., and I saw him about six months since in New-York.” “Can you be mistaken as to his person?” “No. I know him perfectly well.” The testimony of this witness created a marked sensation throughout the auditory, who were evidently unprepared for an impeachment of the veracity of one whose appearance and manner had left a favourable impression. “Do you hear that, Jones?” triumphantly asked his captious associate. “Didn't I tell you that black coated, demure looking young man was not the thing?” The pride of opinion had caused the speaker to elevate his voice, which aroused the ire of one “clothed in a little brief authority.” “Silence!” he shouted with no little asperity, which prevented the reply of the good-humoured Jones. The counsel for the crown now recalled Clifton, who explained the apparent discrepancy of his testimony with that of the last witness, by stating that the person alluded to was his foster-father, whose name he had assumed at the period of his adoption. This being perfectly satisfactory to the learned gentleman, he turned him over to the tender mercies of his opponent, who appeared any thing but gratified at the explanation. Having learned from the counsel for the crown, in casual conversation, that our hero had represented his parents as deceased, he had with much labour and exertion found among the crowd of American shipping a seaman who knew Clifton and asserted positively that his parents were living. Upon this foundation he had in his own mind reared a tower of strength in defence of the prisoner, and the overthrow of his fair fabric caused visible irritation. Affecting to doubt the truth of Clifton's reply, which he termed an artful expedient to cloak untruth, the counsel, with an intimidating look and manner, inquired: “If you are not the son of Mr. Clifton senior, perhaps you will favour the court and jury with the name of your real father.” To this unexpected question the embarrassed witness hesitated to reply; which the examining counsel perceiving—reiterated his inquiry with renewed emphasis. “My dear sir, the question is very simple. Have you not yet learned the name of your father? I know it is said, `that it is a wise child that knows its father;' but we will not demand the proofs of legitimacy, but take your word for the fact.” The few moments thus occupied served to reassure Clifton, and he perceived the necessity of immediately answering the question. “My delay,” he said, “to answer your question, was not from any particular objection to its import, but rather arose from a doubt whether you had a right to enforce a reply. To prevent cavil, however, I will state that the name of my father was Glenthorne.” “Well well, my learned young gentleman, this is pretty fair considering that you were about throwing yourself back on your reserved rights. You would make a shrewd lawyer. Pray, sir, what might be your method of procuring a livelihood?” “Neither by defending wretches from the legitimate consequences of their crimes, nor occupying my time in the enjoyment of wealth wrung from the hard-earned substance of honest industry.” “This, sir, is rather caustic for a tyro. May it please the court to instruct this obstinate witness in his duty? Perhaps a mittimus for contempt might improve his manners.” “I'll not trouble the court to entertain the question. My present visit to London is not connected with any business, and I am at present unoccupied.” Just at this moment a little sallow personage with green spectacles and a nasal organ which protruded itself forward in a remarkable manner, as if it was L * originally formed to nose out hidden mysteries, bustled through the crowd until he reached the counsel for the prisoner. Placing himself by his side he whispered rather audibly in his ear: “Ask him when his father died, and what was his christian name.” With this advice he turned from the counsel and earnestly gazed in Clifton's face, as if life and death awaited the reply. On Clifton's stating that his name was Rupert Glenthorne, and that he died about the year 18—, the sallow querist snapped his fingers with no little gusto, saying, “I thought so—I thought so—I knew there could not be any mistake.” Thus saying, he drew from his pocket a thick memorandum book, and exhibited to the gratified view of the irritated counsel the record of Glenthorne's crime and suicide, among a list of all the malefactors whose histories had been chronicled during the previous thirty years. “Perhaps, my pugnacious gentleman, you will have no objection to state, of what disease your father died? I do not expect you to speak from personal knowledge, but from what you learned was the cause of his death.” Here the court interposed its authority, informing Clifton that he was not compelled to answer the question. Rising with great gravity and dignity, our hero stated, that he should waive the question of right, and briefly reply to the counsel's interrogatory. “As it is not in evidence,” he said, “that I have either inherited the virtues or the vices of my parents, the reply which the counsel attempts to extort, although highly improper, will neither be evaded nor declined. It is my misfortune to be the offspring of a parent, whose passions or whose vices brought infamy on his name, which resulted in the commission of suicide. “What concatenation of circumstances led to this act—whether it was the consequence of rashness or innate depravity, are questions to which I have no means of furnishing a reply. Of his guilt or innocence of the crimes laid to his charge I am equally ignorant, and as he has long since appeared before that tribunal from whose righteous judgment, neither the arts of pettifoggers nor their browbeating of witnesses, can snatch the guilty, I shall not volunteer either to be his defender or accuser.” It should have been before remarked, that on the name of Glenthorne being mentioned by Clifton, the prisoner appeared much agitated, but attributing it to a sudden pain in his side, it elicited, at the time, little notice. After the pause which succeeded our hero's reply had passed, a juror rose and stated, that his associates had deputed him to request the counsel for both the crown and the accused, to omit summing up, if consistent with their views; and although the counsel for the prisoner was reluctant to commit the fate of his client to the jury under the affecting appeal to their sympathies which Clifton had just concluded, yet a refusal would have been equally dangerous, and he therefore united with his opponent in committing the cause to the charge of the judge. After a brief but impartial statement of the case by the court, the jury returned a verdict of Guilty, without leaving their seats. As the crowd was retiring, a diminutive Frenchman said to his companion, “Pauvre diable, he is condemn because he is pauvre diable. If he is rish, he no hand! Dat is Anglais justice. It is not so in La Belle France!” “If you say that again I'll knock you down, you d—d parlevoo! You lie if you say we have no justice in England,” roared a voice in the crowd. It was our testy friend Thomson, who refused to permit his own sentiments to be echoed by a Frenchman. As Clifton proceeded towards his residence, he was overtaken by the little man of the nose, who, pulling off his hat and bowing to the very ground, begged pardon for the liberty he had taken in introducing himself. “My name,” said he, “is Marlow—Job Marlow, at your service. I am now preparing, and have nearly ready for the press, an interesting work, embracing the history of the lives and exploits of the celebrated personages whose peccadillos have rendered them obnoxious to the arbitrary codes of laws which govern modern society; and being anxious to place your father's history by the side of the most distinguished characters of that class, I take the liberty of soliciting your address, that I may here-after have the pleasure of learning the particulars from an authentic source.” Clifton's first impulse was to kick the intruder into the gutter for his untimely insolence, but as the little querist proceeded, his earnest and deferential manner convinced him that he was an original, and he therefore contented himself with bidding him “begone,” in so stern a voice, that the interrogator started back some paces, exclaiming, “Devilish odd! Must be unused to civilized society.” Here he leaned forward, until his body formed a right angle with his legs—his coat flaps extending in a horizontal position—his nose greatly in advance of the rest of his face—and his spectacles on the very tip of their supporter. “Very odd, indeed! might treat a man civilly who desired to immortalize his ancestors.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE WORLD'S OPINION NOT TO BE TOO HIGHLY ESTIMATED—DISGRACE SOMETIMES HEREDITARY—FURTHER DISASTERS. “Fatis accede diisque, Et cole felices; miseros fuge.” Lucan. If it has been our duty in the preceding pages, to exhibit the character of Clifton in less attractive colours than we could have desired, the reader will admit that the causes are mainly to be found in a combination of untoward events, whose united influences were calculated to fetter his energies, and over-shadow the more noble attributes of his mind. Like most men of genius in early life, the imaginative faculty was, in him, more fully developed than was consistent with a perfect mental organization; and the accumulated evils that beset his path, tended still farther to alienate his judgment from its true balance. That he was, at times, a dreamer and an enthusiast—the vassal of superstition, and the captive of wayward fancy—is unquestionable; but it was only in those hours of solitude to which he was driven by the malice of his unprovoked enemy, and the frowns of fate, that he submitted to the temporary sway of unguarded impulses. Nor must it be forgotten that it has been our purpose to lay bare the most hidden secrets of his heart: and who of us, dear reader, could pass through so searching an ordeal, without exhibiting judgment perverted—passions unrestrained—and opportunities neglected? The exposure of the trial, while it aroused his feelings, furnished an opportunity for the exercise of the more vigorous powers of his intellect, and a display of that judgment, fortitude, and tact, whose united influences never failed him in a moment of emergency. Hitherto his intercourse with the world had exposed somewhat of its envy, malice, and deception, but his experience had not yet reached that unhappy elevation which exhibits, at a glance, the prominent faults of human nature, causing distrust and suspicion to poison the most sacred social enjoyments. A neophyte, he had as yet only been permitted to enter the vestibule of the temple, but the period of his probation had now passed, and he was introduced to a more distinct view of the defects of his species. Notwithstanding his respect for Lord Templeton, and his unwillingness to attribute unworthy prejudices to one so liberal in his feelings and opinions, there was no mistaking the change in his lordship's manner, after the disclosure of our hero's parentage. That he endeavoured to assume his former manner towards Clifton was evident, but the effort was so visible that it but marked the contrast which it was designed to conceal. As he passed through the streets on the following morning, Clifton met the Hon. Mr. Courtenay, and although that gentleman lifted his hat and tendered a most gracious bow, yet his open and expressive countenance could not conceal his knowledge of Clifton's unlucky birth, and his embarrassment at the necessity of recognizing, with courtesy, one whom the world would consider disqualified for unreserved personal intercourse with the respectable members of society. The conviction thus forced on him, of the humble station he must hereafter occupy in the world's regard, increased the reserve that was before sufficiently conspicuous in his manner, until he at length determined to anticipate his persecutors and shun the acquaintance of the few individuals who had distinguished him by their notice. Lord Templeton and Mr. Courtenay were both sensible of the injustice of visiting the sins of the father upon the innocent offspring, but how were they to stem the torrent of public prejudice? If in a spirit of independent feeling they should invite Clifton to their dwellings and treat him as an associate, would not the elevated circle of their friends indignantly repudiate the attempt to thrust upon them the companionship of an interdicted personage? Such were the natural reflections of these honourable individuals, who rather hesitated than declined to execute what their hearts had conceived. Clifton in the meantime more fully and calmly canvassed the subject, and while he denied the justice of the world's verdict, did not fail to find palliatives for their decision in the conventional laws of society. The prejudices of his New York friends, although founded on false testimony, were in their nature not only justifiable but honourable, and he viewed them now in a more correct light than before they were contrasted by the conduct of the London public. Meanwhile the doomed prisoner received his sentence, and metropolitan curiosity was directed to other and more recent offenders. As Clifton was entering the door of his lodgings, one fine evening, shortly after the condemnation of the robber, a lad gave him a note from the ordinary of Newgate, stating that he was desired by a miserable criminal, who was extremely ill, to request the immediate attendance of Mr. Clifton at his cell, where he would learn some circumstances of his early history with which it was most important to his future happiness that he should be made acquainted. A postscript to the letter urged his immediate presence, if he wished to hear the disclosure, as the prisoner failed rapidly, and it was doubtful whether he would survive the night. As the messenger volunteered to Vol. II.—M be his guide, he immediately proceeded to the gloomy abode of vice, misery, and despair. The appearance of these human caravans, where are caged like wild beasts the outlaws of society, is at any time sufficiently repulsive; but when darkness spreads its pall over their massy walls and barred windows, to one breathing the air of liberty, they assume a frightful and terrific aspect. Who can tell what feelings are lacerated, what sympathies ruthlessly sundered or hearts crushed by the dread fiat which consigns husbands, fathers, brothers or lovers to the cheerless confines of yon solitary cells? Such were Clifton's thoughts as the ponderous door with its grating hinges opened to admit him into the outer portion of the prison, and by the time he had reached the narrow abode of the criminal who had desired his presence, his feelings had almost overpowered his strength. No sooner, however, had he recognized in the emaciated figure stretched before him, the robber whom his testimony had consigned to a premature grave, than he felt that sickness of heart which is the result of a natural repugnance to inflict even merited punishment on an unresisting and powerless fellow being. The unhappy wretch was indeed an object fitted to excite unmitigated compassion. His features were distorted by disease and remorse, and, as he attempted to address Clifton, the effort caused a still greater convulsion of the muscles of his face; and his voice was scarcely audible, although our hero placed his ear near the mouth of the speaker, and awaited his disclosure with breathless anxiety. The only words he could distinguish were “father,”—“mother,”—“stolen,”—“carried off,”—“poor girl,”— “drowned,” and many other detached expressions which conveyed no definite meaning, and only served to throw Clifton into an agony of apprehension, lest the angel of death should sever the spirit from its earthly tenement ere the secret should be divulged on which his happiness depended. After various abortive efforts to render himself intelligible, the culprit's head sank back on its hard pillow, and the death rattle in his throat, and his irregular and struggling respiration too visibly foretold the brief period of his earthly probation. As Clifton continued to apply that moisture to his lips which was the only relief his extreme weakness permitted him to receive, he watched each changing expression of his countenance, as if he might perchance gather from them some key to the mystery that lay concealed in his bosom. But alas, no sign was visible. Feeble and more irregular with each passing moment seemed his respiration—until, as the physician, in going his rounds, stopped and gave a glance at his dying patient, a momentary light gleamed wildly from his eyes, and with a groan and a sigh, his breath departed—his cheeks collapsed— his chin dropped, and the professional gentleman pronounced his earthly career closed. Almost maddened with anxiety and excitement Clifton rushed from the prison, and in the agony of his feelings was tempted to precipitate himself into the Thames, and end his miseries and his existence at the same moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. SCENES THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD FAIN LEAVE UNDEPICTED. “Think not of his eyes of fire Nor his wily heart's desire, Nor the locks that round his head Run like wreathed snakes, and fling A shadow o'er his eyes glancing.” “Farewell, lost Prosperine.” Barry Cornwall. Again the course of our history leads us to that youthful empire, the dawn of whose might and prosperity has already fixed the gaze of the world in wonder and admiration. To America, then, dear reader, with the speed of thought let us together wing our flight, nor pause until the spires, cupolas and vanes of her commercial emporium glitter before us in the sunbeam! There she rises like Venus from the ocean, captivating in her loveliness,—her isle-gemmed girdle sparkling in light—her handmaid Commerce on the one hand speeding her white-winged couriers on their mission to distant lands, M* while on the other appear the twin sisters, Agriculture and manufactures depositing at the feet of their queen the accumulated treasures their toil and skill have won! How humiliating is the conviction that the crimes and passions of our species are able to descrate a spot which nature and art had otherwise rendered an earthly paradise. The vicious De Lyle still pursued his course of folly and iniquity, unchecked, and apparently unamenable to retribution. The morning is bright and serene, and there remains in the atmosphere but that slight chill which the dying winter leaves as a legacy to its buoyant successor, like the well meant advice of a departing miser to the listless ear of his spendthrift heir. Every sojourner in the American metropolis, from limping age to heedless childhood, greeted the advent of the beautiful morn with smiles, and even the usually monotonous ring of the dustman's bell, awoke to rude melody beneath the elastic swing of its cheerful owner. To the daughter of Isaac Samuel in particular its roseate flush was attended with new delight, for De Lyle, to whom, under the assumed name of Stillman, she had pledged her virgin heart, with all its treasure of affection, had increased the frequency of his visits since his last interview with Burchard, and appeared to the deluded girl actuated by the most ardent and honourable attachment. While labouring under apprehensions of his associates's treachery, his feelings were too painfully excited to permit that constant attention to Rachel Samuel, which had before characterized his intercourse with her, but now he compensated for his previous absence, by daily exhibiting that tenderness of manner which he could so well assume, and which so fatally enthralled his beautiful and credulous admirer. About the hour of ten o'clock a slight knock at the door of the Jew's residence was heard with rapture by Rachel, who with buoyant heart and sparkling eyes admitted her lover. “Oh, Mr. Stillman,” exclaimed the tall and queen-like girl, “You have just come in time to catch the new-born fragrance of my early flowers. Before I was so foolish as to occupy my time and thoughts in the contemplation of our mutual attachment, the garden in front of our house was my chief care; but since it is desirable to us both to avoid the prying gaze of impertinent curiosity, I have transferred my regard to the little mimick lawn in the rear; and this morning the early flowers have burst forth on purpose to welcome you. Do you not think this an emblem of hope and happiness?” Thus saying, she took his proffered arm, and listened with downcast looks and burning blushes to the oft-repeated tale of his unconquerable passion. On reaching the little garden, she conducted him along the narrow and newly gravelled walk, and leaning over the well trimmed rows of box—whose thick branches were modelled into miniature walls, castles, bridges and turrets, she continued to direct his attention to the beauties of flowers, whose fragrance was so grateful to the newly awakened sense of their fair cultivator. The rose had elicited from De Lyle an appropriate encomium—the violet received the fitting meed of its unpretending loveliness—the honey-suckle attracted merited admiration, while the lovely Jewess seemed the goddess of the place, dispensing her favours in the shape of bouquets to the most devoted of her idolaters. Soft and musical did the words of love flow from the lips of De Lyle while returning to the house; and as he seated himself in the parlour, the confiding girl permitted him to clasp her to his bosom, with a fervour and boldness, which at an earlier period would have aroused the jealous opposition of maiden pride and purity. “Now,” thought De Lyle, “my task is nearly finished. The outworks are in my power, and the garrison will soon surrender at discretion.” At this moment a knock at the door interrupted the tête-à-tête, and as Miss Samuel entered the hall, she was met by a young female of apparently humble rank, who desired the pleasure of a few moment's conversation on a subject of importance, and excusing herself to De Lyle, Rachel joined the visitor in an apartment adjoining that in which he was seated. But a short time had elapsed, when the door of the little parlour opened, and exposed to the view of the alarmed De Lyle the exasperated countenance of the maid who had formerly attended Julia Borrowdale, and who, after his double purpose of destroying Clifton, and ruining the treacherous girl was served, had been abandoned by him to her fate, without receiving the least attention to her angry remonstrances. By her side, pale as a marble statue, stood the beautiful Jewess, whose features displayed the keenest suffering; and her grieved and despairing countenance was strikingly contrasted by the fierce and almost savage look of the triumphant Abigail. “There sits the wretch who has villanously abandoned me,” were her first words; “may be, Mr. De Lyle, you will deny your name to me, won't you?” With this exclamation, she placed herself directly before him, and with the most furious gestures continued to utter threats and execrations. De Lyle, whose experience in such matters prevented undue agitation, coolly rose, and addressing Miss Samuel, solicited permission to withdraw, if the insane person before him was longer permitted to utter her incoherent ravings under her roof. “It is impossible for me to say,” he continued calmly, “whether this female is deranged in her intellect, or whether she is employed by some jealous or artful person to destroy my character, and drive me from the presence of one whom I shall ever remember with the fondest regard. But whichever may be the true solution of the enigma, I owe it to my own dignity and honour to abandon a house which I can no longer visit without being subject to the most cruel and unjust suspicions.” The cool impudence of this experienced tactician threw the astonished waiting maid in nautical phrase, “all aback,” and her hesitation and surprise began to create a doubt in the mind of Rachel as to the truth of her statements. At this moment the door quietly opened, and the attenuated form of Isaac Samuel glided into the circle, like the ghost of some murdered traveller into the presence of his assassins. De Lyle instantly perceived that evil destiny had doomed his ruin, and that the hour had arrived for the execution of its stern decree. “Mr. De Lyle, said the Jew, with a malicious sneer on his countenance, “this is an unexpected honour. “May I be permitted to inquire the cause of this unlooked for condescension on your part? “Little did I hope to meet so distinguished and honourable a visitor in my poor domicil.” As the exasperated Israelite pronounced the name of De Lyle, a piercing shriek was uttered by his agonized daughter; and he had but ceased speaking when she fell senseless on the floor, the blood flowing copiously from her mouth, it being evident that the shock had caused the rupture of a blood vessel. With the most intense agony depicted in his countenance, Isaac Samuel rushed to her assistance, while the servant was despatched for the nearest physician. During the bustle and confusion consequent on these events, De Lyle withdrew unnoticed, and with rapid footsteps traversed the streets which led to his father's residence. As he opened the door of the Jew's residence when making his exit, the hated countenance of Burchard peered instantly over the picket fence in front of the dwelling, nor could a doubt remain in De Lyle's mind of his agency in this ruinous exposure, when he caught the malignant triumph depicted in the traitor's countenance. Too much alarmed to pause in his retreat, he passed on without noticing his quondam associate, and Burchard, satisfied with his success, slowly sauntered to his home. The reader will no doubt have conceived the causes which led to the exposure of De Lyle by his treacherous instrument. A second anonymous epistle informed him that the time had arrived to strike the blow, if he wished to avoid incarceration, and the knowledge of De Lyle's amour with the waiting maid, and of his designs upon Rachel Samuel, furnished him with means to accomplish his purpose without personal hazard. Knowing how completely De Lyle was in the power of the wily and grasping Israelite, Burchard saw the impossibility of his escape from the gripe of his inexorable creditor, when the wrath of the latter should be aroused by so unpardonable an offence as a dishonourable attempt on the virtue of his child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE VICTIM BLEEDS—UNAVAILABLE REMORSE. We call thee vainly; on the ground She sinks without a single wound.” “And is this fountain left alone For a sad remembrance, where We may in after-times repair, With heavy heart and weeping eye To sing songs to her memory.” Barry Cornwall. In a neat and tastefully furnished chamber, whose lack of recent care attested the absence of that daily attention which it formerly received from its fair occupant, lay the attenuated form of Rachel Samuel. The physician had, with great difficulty effected her resuscitation on the morning when De Lyle's visit ended so unhappily for her peace of mind, and her debility appeared rather to increase than diminish with the lapse of time. By her side sat her distracted father, whose indignation at De Lyle's treachery and baseness knew no diminution; but who feared to leave the couch of his beloved child, even for the desirable purpose of wreaking vengence on the destroyer of her peace, if not of her life. The appearance of the Jew was to the last degree wretched. The furrows which avarice had ploughed on his brow were daily deepened by the anxiety and grief attendant upon his daughter's critical situation, increased by the gloomy reports of the physician, which from hour to hour came like birds of evil omen to sound their dismal tidings in his ear. So intent had he been in the pursuit of gain, that he was not sensible of the hold his daughter retained in his affections, until the fear of her loss awakened in his bosom that intensity of feeling which at times gushes from the hard heart of the selfish, like the refreshing stream that poured from the rock, when its flinty side was smitten by the prophet on Mount Horeb. Although several days had elapsed since Rachel's illness commenced, he had scarcely quitted her bedside for a moment, and the length of his beard, which continued unshaven, gave a still more haggard aspect to his care-worn features. Many had been the entreaties of his afflicted child that he would retire to his bed until exhausted nature could rally its energies by repose, but he insisted on retaining his position, alleging that he slept comfortably in his easy chair. But if his anxiety for the fate of his daughter was agonizing, what language can express his remorse at the maddening reflection that for filthy lucre he had ministered to the depraved Vol. II.—N appetites of De Lyle, and thus indirectly been the instrument of her misery. Oh, if there is one crowning drop in the cup of human grief, which causes it to overflow with unspeakable bitterness, it is the reflection that our passions, or our crimes, have, in their fearful recoil destroyed the only being, the light of whose love cheered the darkness of our earthly pilgrimage! May it never be the lot of our most implacable foe to realize this truth in the terrible force with which it rushed on the conscience-stricken soul of Isaac Samuel! As yet a slight gleam of hope of his daughter's ultimate recovery continued to flash across his mind, but the time was now at hand which would dispel the last ray, and force the dread conviction that he soon was to be childless, friendless, forsaken! A beautiful evening had succeeded a day of gloom—and as the setting sun threw a roseate flush over the windows of the invalid's chamber, her feeble energies appeared somewhat to revive: and to her father's anxious inquiries she replied, with a sweet smile, that her feelings were more buoyant than they had been for many days. This cheerful response caused the relieved father to hope that the disease had reached its crisis, and that returning health would hereafter mark its glowing impress on her pallid cheek. His head now rested on his hand, and fancy was busy with the future; painting the close of his earthly career in brighter colours than those with which memory arrayed the past; until his soothed feelings caused a gentle slumber, whose dreams, brighter than their predecessors, were, alas! neither more fleeting nor unsubstantial. His slumbers had continued but a few moments, when he was aroused by the stifled groans of his unhappy child; and, although he sprung from his seat with the utmost haste, the spirit of the sufferer had pierced the mysteries of eternity before his arm could raise her head from the pillow. To picture the agony of the despairing father exceeds our art, and we leave the imagination of the reader to perform the dismal task!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. A VIEW INTO THE DEPTHS OF A VIRTUOUS WO MAN'S HEART—THE ENLIGHTENED PRACTITIONER. “But love is indestructible. Its holy flame forever burneth, From heaven it came, to heaven returneth; Too oft on earth a troubled guest, At times deceived, at times opprest, It here is tried and purified, Then hath in heaven its perfect rest; It soweth here with toil and care, But the harvest time of love is there.” Southey. The narration of the events we have thus far chronicled, has perhaps prevented us from bestowing due attention on the lovely being whose image was so deeply engraved on the heart of Clifton. In truth few and far between were the incidents which varied the monotony of her secluded existence. The record of events connected with her history would but unfold the emotions, fears, hopes, doubts, and anxieties of a susceptible girl, the most imposing vicissitudes of whose life could be legitimately embraced in the story of a heart. The passing days, as they came and went, found and left her the same in feeling and affection—except that perchance, as the frail tenure of her earthly existence became more vividly impressed on her mind, the flame of her love for Clifton beamed with a deeper, holier, purer effulgence—as if, like the fire upon the altar, it had caught its inspiration from the breath of HIM WHOSE THRONE IS LOVE. The change in her health, although heretofore almost imperceptible to those who, like her fond parents, were hourly in her presence, when the fickle month of March arrived assumed a more decided and alarming aspect, until Mr. and Mrs. Borrowdale's fears were intensely excited; and they besought the attending physician with tears to call into requisition all the resources of his art, lest in an evil hour their last hope should, with the spirit of Julia, wing its flight beyond the confines of earth. Archibald Nelmoth, M. D., who officiated in the capacity of family physician to Mr. Borrowdale, was a graduate of Harvard University. On receiving his diploma from the college of physicians and surgeons of Boston, he immediately commenced practice in that city, and if patient and untiring application, united to an ardent attachment to his profession, and a skilful adaptation of means to accomplish desired results could have insured success, Doctor Nelmoth's claims to favour and patronage would have been unanimously acknowledged and correspondingly rewarded. That no such good fortune N* awaited the worthy physician may be the subject of surprise to our sanguine readers, but will fail to astonish those initiated in the secrets appertaining to worldly success. Unfortunately for the doctor's pecuniary interests, his love of truth and abhorrence of deception, even in trifles, were of too stubborn a growth to be uprooted; and while the superficial disciples of Esculapius were paying their court to the fashionable circles of the literary emporium, Doctor Nelmoth was patiently mastering the intricacies of medical science, or wasting his skill on some forsaken child of poverty, whose gratitude bore a most undue proportion to his means. But a few weeks subsequent to his entrance on his professional career, the child of a wealthy and influential lady, residing in the vicinity of his office, met with a serious accident, and the desire to secure speedy surgical aid induced a resort to Doctor Nelmoth; and so successful was he in relieving the little sufferer that he became regularly installed as attending physician to the family. This event gave a most favourable turn to his prospects, for the mother of the child was a leader in the fashionable world, whose fiat was fate; but destiny, which delights in thwarting the most well-founded anticipations, erected a barrier to the success of our medical friend, at the very crisis of his fortunes. Being suddenly summoned to attend his lady patroness, who was represented as alarmingly ill, he found her reclining on a sumptuous couch, with a phial of hartshorn in one hand, while with the other she was gracefully fondling her favourite poodle. On examining her pulse and learning the symptoms of the case, he candidly declared that late hours and the excesses of fashionable dissipation were the sole causes of her debility; and that nothing but a resort to plain food, exercise on foot, and retiring early to rest would be of permanent service. Against this uncourteous and unwelcome advice the lady vehemently remonstrated, and on the doctor persisting in his decision, she gave him to understand that his professional services were no longer needed; and the same day beheld the introduction of a more pliant practitioner, who not only pronounced the views of his predecessor absurd, but obligingly coincided with his fair patient's fluctuating opinion of the state of her health—never resorting to remedies until he first learned that they were adapted to her taste. As will readily be inferred, the practice of Doctor Nelmoth languished beneath the withering blight of the fashionable lady's displeasure, while the star of his rival shone proudly in the ascendant. It was a few years subsequent to this untoward event, while he was struggling with pecuniary difficulties, that he became acquainted with Mr. Borrowdale, who, delighted with his talents no less than the variety and extent of his general and professional information, invited him to settle near his seat, where, by the aid of his generous friend, he speedily attained a respectable station among his competitors. Although rather past the prime of life, the good doctor was still a bachelor, and while his amiable disposition and cheerful temper would have constituted him a charming companion to a female, his devoted attachment to literature and science, rendered him invulnerable to the meaning glances of the fair maidens with whom he was acquainted. A high forehead, slightly bald at the temples, and a fine dark eye, which sparkled with benevolence and intelligence, were perhaps the only features of his face that could be considered otherwise than plain; but so pleasing were his conversational powers, when in company with those he loved, that one could scarcely refrain from pronouncing him positively handsome. It was only, however, when enjoying the companionship of congenial spirits, that the natural reserve of his character allowed him to appear with advantage; while the presence of fashionable triflers of either sex was sufficient completely to seal the fountains of his intelligence for the time. That the prejudices he naturally entertained against parvenu assumption were confirmed and strengthened by the recollection of his early adventure with the leader of fashionable society in the city, is probable; and as poverty had failed to wring civilities from which his hudgment dissented, it is not surprising that he declined the effort in the palmy days of worldly competency. For Mr. Borrowdale and his amiable family, he entertained the most affectionate regard; nor will it be doubted, that his anxiety for Julia's recovery elicited the exercise of his utmost professional skill, and constant and unwearied attendance. On the afternoon of one of those bland and balmy days at the close of winter, which, like the dove from the ark, bear on their wings glad tidings to the whole human race—but in an especial degree to the faint spirit of the invalid—the fair Julia half reclined on the sofa in her little boudoir, moralizing on the uncertainty of all earthly expectations. The setting sun poured its farewell beams through the spacious and somewhat antiquated windows of the apartment, (like the dying dolphin reserving its brightest glories for the last,) its golden hues assuming a richer warmth as they reflected the glowing tint of the crimson drapery which relieved the otherwise sombre aspect of the deeply imbedded and heavily moulded casements. There are moments, when the curtain of the past is drawn from before our mental vision;—when the emotions of by-gone years resume their empire over the heart;—when “the lost, the loved, the distant and the dead” pass in review before us, untouched by time, unscathed by sorrow, unchanged by circumstance. Oh! is not this re-creative power at once the type and the seal of immortality? Can the soul, with its high capacities, its aspirations that soar to the third heaven of intellect; its grasp encircling the vast myriads of material systems, and skirting along those shadowy regions where conjecture alone wields the sceptre; can it be that, like the butterfly, it is destined to sport its little hour and descend to the debasement of the clod and the worm? Let him doubt on whose spirit the icy hand of scepticism has fallen—chilling its divine sympathies, and chaining its powers of discrimination—but let the gifted and the pure and the lovely clasp the hopes of a brighter world to their bosoms with joy and confidence. To Julia, although attenuated by that silent and insidious disease which, in mockery, decorates its victim with the ensigns of health, while decay and dissolution are fastened on the vitals, this power of retrospection was especially vouchsafed; and with that single-heartedness and disinterestedness found alone in the softer sex, her thoughts, whether resting on the joys of the past, or shuddering at the drear prospect of the future, were associated with Clifton in all their wanderings; she forgetting her own peril in the absorbing intensity of her love for him, and centreing her every wish in the desire for his happiness. Some there may be who doubt whether beneath our northern skies the passion of love is susceptible of so spontaneous a growth as that of Julia for Clifton, but he little understands the mysterious labyrinths of the human heart, and the latent fires which lie concealed within its depths, who deems the glowing sun of a tropical climate necessary for its precocious maturity. Oh no. Love is, itself, the sun and centre of a moral system—imparting light and heat by its own essence. Beneath its creative beams, bud, blossom, and fruit, leap into life and loveliness—offspring of a moment, but heirs of immortality! Such is love:—and he who has never been a sojourner beneath its pleasant skies—nor inhaled the perfume of its flowers—nor sported with its nymphs —nor sipped its nectar—nor bathed in its fountains—nor reclined beneath its shade—has bartered the gems of existence for worthless baubles! For him no poet shall tune the lyre, nor fame with brazen trumpet herald his deeds to after ages. As Julia reflected on the difficulties which environed her lover, she at times despaired of his power to convince a censorious world of his innocence, or burst through the meshes of the fatal web which exiled him from his country and his friends. “If,” she thought, “malice and perjury have combined to blacken his fair fame, what hope is there that remorse or penitence will enter into the bosom of a wretch guilty of a crime so heinous, inducing him to proclaim Clifton's innocence and his own infamy. No, no. The bare idea is inadmissible. Oh, Clifton—Clifton! would that these eyes might again be blessed with your presence, even were it but for a moment, that the mystery might be unveiled which now shadows your reputation. But alas! an exile from your home—a wanderer in another clime—a vast ocean separates you from my sight, and much I fear that the angel of death will bear my spirit to its eternal home, before I shall be enabled to inform you of my devoted love, and my unshaken confidence in your innocence.” The ardour of her feelings caused her to utter the latter portion of this soliloquy aloud, and Doctor Nelmoth, who was at that moment approaching her apartment, became an involuntary listener. The excellent physician was not a little embarrassed at this occurrence, for his respect for the sanctities of the heart was peculiarly profound and sensitive; and while he was disposed to be gratified at learning the nature and cause of her malady—trusting that he could now shape his professional course with some prospect of benefit to his fair patient—he yet was almost pained at the conviction that he was the depository of a secret which his lovely young friend desired sedulously to conceal. Fearing that his embarrassment would be observed by Julia, if he entered at the moment, he, with a light step, receded to some distance, and in a few moments returned with a heavy tread to the door, knocked, and was admitted. As he entered, the charming girl half arose from her seat, near the window, and a straggling sunbeam that momentarily rested on her face and neck, exhibited, with fearful distinctness, the transparent and unearthly delicacy of her features. Reluctant to remain, lest his truant tongue should, by some inadvertent allusion, divulge his knowledge of her secret, he went through the ordinary routine of professional inquiries, and attributing his haste to urgent business, departed. After Doctor Nelmoth had retired to the privacy of his chamber, he long continued to reflect on the most effectual method of rendering the information he had received subservient to Julia's restoration. Something he had learned in casual conversation with Mr. Borrowdale, of the debt of gratitude which that gentleman admitted he owed Clifton for rescuing Julia from her perilous situation; nor was he a stranger to the events which had since shaken his confidence in the integrity and virtue of our hero. As during all this period Julia had never alluded to Clifton, he was, until the present moment, entirely ignorant of her attachment. Fully aware of the sensibility and delicacy of her feelings, and satisfied that Mr. Borrowdale's sentiments in relation to Clifton were too firmly implanted to be removed without convincing proofs of his error, the doctor long debated in his own mind as to the expediency of disclosing his knowledge of the cause of Julia's illness, either to herself or to her parents. His judgment at length determined him to confine the secret for the present to his own breast, leaving his future course to be governed by circumstances. The next morning found the doctor an early visiter to Julia's apartment, whom he observed, with Vol II.—O deep regret, moody and melancholy, and unable to more than counterfeit the sweet smile which usually welcomed the entrance of her adviser and friend. Seating himself by her side on the sofa, he took the hand she extended, and while his finger lay almost passively on her pulse, remarked, “What a lovely evening we were blessed with yesterday. It appeared to me the sweet harbinger of happiness to the victim of declining health, who, like yourself, has youth and strength sufficient to repel the enfeebled assaults of the expiring winter. In a few—very few days, the birds will again charm you with their melodies—the flowers waft their perfumes through your lattice—while such middle-aged gentlemen as myself will be laid aside, as neither seasonable nor useful.” “Oh, my dear doctor,” replied Julia, “do not jest on a subject with which the affections and friendship of life are entwined. If you should no longer cheer me with your society, another prop of my existence would be removed, and I doubt if I could survive the shock.” Thus saying the tears coursed down her cheek, and it was some moments ere the doctor could sufficiently compose himself to say:— “You are right, my child—you are right. Believe me, I but intended to while away the hours, but unhappily struck a harsh and unharmonious chord. Forget it, and I will be more wary in future. It is unnecessary for me to assure you of the deep interest I feel in your recovery, nor is it proper for me to disguise my conviction that a much longer residence in this fluctuating climate will be attended with imminent hazard. In mid-winter, a voyage to Europe would have been highly improper, but the season has now arrived when it is no longer dangerous. I have not broached the subject to your parents, feeling desirous first to ascertain your own views in relation to it.” In vain, lovely sufferer, your tongue like a wakeful sentinel, now guards with sleepless vigilance the treasure of your love from the gaze of prying curiosity—a moment of forgetfulness has unlocked the portals of your affections, and the treacherous pulse and tell-tale cheek conspire to break down the remaining defences! Thus thought the physician, as cheek and pulse fluttered with the excitement that her agitated feelings underwent at this suggestion. Again her tears flowed afresh, and all the reply she could make was, “Leave me now, dear doctor, and I will reflect on your suggestion. My poor nerves are too tremulous to permit me to decide just now.” “God bless you!—God bless you, my child,” was the response of the affectionate physician, as he arose and left the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. FAME NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE—THE RECOGNITION. “Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to” fate, Too soon dejected and too soon elatc.” Pope. “The prostrate soul, beneath A load of huge imagination heaves.” Armstrong. The literati of London still continued occasionally to discuss the question relating to the paternity of the two popular tales which had set the reading world agog; and many were the inquiries into the cause which induced the pen of the unknown author to remain idle, when fame and fortune were waiting on his nod. After he left the party at Mr. Courtenay's mansion, on the evening before mentioned, the question seriously arose in his mind whether he should not doff the mask, and in his proper person wear the honours which the literary public had awarded to the incognito; but the appearance of Ellingbourne's double, and the depressing incident in the trial which disclosed the infamy of his parent, dispelled the incipient desire for notoriety. That he would still attract attention notwithstanding the stigma of his birth, he did not doubt, but the applause of the good—the fellowship of the refined— the sympathies of the gifted, would be withheld; and what would he gain but the gaping wonder of the vulgar throng? These considerations deterred him also from attempting for the present any new effort in the walks of literature; and when the unfortunate issue of his visit to the imprisoned robber severed the hope of learning the particulars of his early history, the death-knell of his hopes, enterprize and ambition, appeared to sound audibly in his ears. What mystery could surround his birth and infancy was more than he could conjecture, but it was evident from the anxiety of the dying criminal, that it was of the most vital importance to his happiness that it should be disclosed. Night after night would he lie on his pillow, imagining every possible contingency that could have happened to prevent his knowledge of his real birth and parentage, and at the last he was obliged to confess the little probability that any disclosure would remove the stigma that rested on his name as the offspring of a suicide and a murderer. From this theme he would revert to his love for Julia, and although at times his confidence in her firmness and affection remained unshaken, yet he shuddered at the bare possibility of his being deluded. For several days he had scarcely left his room, so reluctant was he to mingle with the crowd who could so little enter into or sympathize O* with his feelings—but the morning was so inviting— the clear sky and cheerful sun so calmly united in wooing him from his solitude, that he arranged his dress with some little care, and sauntered forth without precisely determining in what direction to shape his course. Dreamy and abstracted, his footsteps traversed a considerable distance from his lodgings before he reflected on the subject of his peregrinations abroad, and how much longer he might have continued unconsciously to wander it is impossible to say, if the inspiring notes of a full band of music had not by their martial melody aroused his listless thoughts from their reveries. As the regimental band wheeled into a broad avenue which communicated with a spacious square, the helmets and glittering uniforms of platoon after platoon of British infantry, cavalry, and artillery sparkled in the sunbeam, while their waving plumes, and the prancing steeds and showy equipments of their officers, formed an imposing scene to one who, like Clifton, had never before beheld the admirable discipline, and gallant bearing of the brave soldiery of the fast-anchored isle. On inquiry he learned that the troops were to be reviewed by the king in person, and as several brigades were to assemble on the occasion, he determined to join the immense crowd of spectators whom the presence of royalty and the splendid military spectacle had attracted to the scene. A neighbouring gallery, which had been erected to accommodate those who chose to pay for the privilege of obtaining a full view of the array, was selected as a proper station, and he accordingly obtained a seat on the front bench, which was but little elevated above the heads of the cavalry, and overlooked a broad avenue along whose gravelled centre the private equipages of the nobility and gentry were continually passing and repassing. On either side of the avenue, pedestrians were loitering—some peering most inquisitively into the splendid coaches of the aristocracy— others directing their attention to the evolutions of the military; while the more eager and anxious majority rapidly cast their eyes from side to side, as if apprehensive that a portion of the brilliant display might escape their notice. At length the cry of “the king”—“his majesty,” came swelling on the ear from voices in the distance, and soon the earth shook with the welcoming shouts of the enthusiastic populace on his near approach. Although Clifton's republican sentiments prevented his viewing the attributes of royalty with that profound respect which actuated the subjects of the British king, he yet could not avoid being favourably impressed with the frank and manly countenance and venerable aspect of the benevolent monarch. Happily the prejudices of the people of America and Great Britain had become dissipated by mutual intercourse and the interchange of good offices, and Clifton looked therefore on the institutions of England as subject to the control of her own citizens, and as national peculiarities with whose structure or defects he had no right to intermeddle. At length the royal review was ended, and the numerous regiments moved again into marching order, and with stately steps and erect carriage retired from the scene whose chief attraction was dispelled by their absence. As Clifton was preparing to descend from the gallery, an open landau attracted his attention, and as it came near and made a partial halt, to his astonishment and joy, he beheld Mr. and Mrs. Borrowdale on the back seat directly facing him, while the slender form of a female and the more robust figure of a gentleman occupied the front seat, and of course their backs were towards him. For a moment the pulsations of his heart were suspended, his brain reeled, and he almost fell from his seat, and before he entirely recovered his self-possession, the carriage was in motion, and as it passed directly beneath him, he perceived that he was recognized by Mr. Borrowdale, who however gave no token that he was noticed; as he watched the receding vehicle, he perceived that the lady in front was his adored Julia, and that the gentleman at her side seemed to pay her the most assiduous and respectful attention! That she had not observed him was evident, but the cause was found in her eager solicitude to catch every word that fell from the lips of the gallant by her side. Who could he be? Was he her admirer? Was he not already her husband? The rapid motion of the carriage had prevented him from closely scanning the features of either Julia or the stranger, and therefore could but conjecture the probable nature of their intercourse; but what lover ever yet entered into the realms of conjecture, while under the sway of jealousy, whose fancy did not run a tilt with rivalry and despair? While Julia was in another hemisphere, the impossibility of any communication passing between them trained his mind to a partial quiescence in the decrees of an inevitable destiny; but the thought that she was now in the same city with himself, perhaps residing in an adjoining street, and almost within the sound of his voice, without his being enabled to communicate his unalterable love, his deep devotion:—the idea was madness. His first impulse was after descending from the gallery to call a hackney coach, and endeavour to track the carriage of Mr. Borrowdale to its destination; but independent of the improbability of his tracing them in the crowd of vehicles, his pride revolted at the attempt to force himself on that gentleman's attention, after he had refused to tender him any token of recognition. In this mood he retraced his steps to his lodgings, occupying the hours that should have been sacred to repose, in imagining every possible cause for Julia's attention to the gentleman at her side, and at last compelled by fatigue and anxiety to enter the land of dreams, without arriving nearer a satisfactory solution than when he first rested his head on his pillow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. THE CHASE—A DISCOVERY. “Oh name forever sad! forever dear! Still breathed in sighs, still ushered with a tear. I tremble too, where'er my own I find Some dire misfortune follows close behind.” Pope. The following morning found Clifton on his way to the post-office, in the faint hope that if he received no communications from his friends in New-York, Julia might by a line inform him where she resided in London. Although by no means certain that she was aware of his being in that city, yet the bare possibility that such might be the case, determined him to apply at the post-office and inquire for letters. As he was pushing forward, a vehicle similar to that which Mr. Borrowdale occupied on the previous day, suddenly turned a corner of the street in front of him, and the only lady who was seated in it, as nearly as he could judge at the distance, resembled his charming fair one. As the high-mettled steeds dashed onward with their lovely burthen, he at once saw the impossibility of overtaking them on foot; and an empty hackney coach passing, he hailed the jehu, and was soon in full pursuit of the receding landau. The jaded hacks were at Clifton's instance urged to their utmost speed, and after submitting to numerous detentions, caused by those obstacles which momentarily interrupt the progress of vehicles in the metropolis—during which the landau was at times seen, and again suddenly turning a corner disappeared—he at length to his great gratification saw it drawn up at the door of a handsome mansion in Portland Place. With all possible rapidity the fatigued horses were driven to the spot, but before their arrival the lady had entered the house, although the carriage still remained at the door. Presuming that she was paying a morning visit, Clifton dismissed his hack and remained on the opposite side of the street, determined to accost the lady on her re-appearance, if, as he little doubted, she was his beloved Julia. At least two hours elapsed before the door opened, and to Clifton's infinite chagrin and vexation, a superannuated specimen of the feminine sex appeared, compared with whom the beautiful Julia was “Hyperion to a satyr.” As she entered the vehicle our hero moved away with a heavy heart, in spirit and appearance resembling the mortified fox hunter, who, after following the hounds through a morning's eager chase, finds the cunning Reynard too shrewd for his pursuers, and the game run down in the shape of an attenuated rabbit. Again he directed his steps towards the post-office—musing as he went on as many of his late disappointments and distresses as his memory could conveniently compass in so brief a space of time. It at length occurred to his mind that he had been particularly remiss in not pursuing the landau to its ultimate destination, or inquiring the name of its owner from the footman, as there remained scarcely a doubt of its being the same carriage in which Julia was seated the day before, and by learning the residence of the owner, he would at once have been enabled to procure an interview with her he loved. But as it fared with all his recent movements, the lucky moment was irretrievably past. On arriving at the post-office, the clerk on his inquiring for letters, presented him with a large package which bore the city post-mark. On opening it with eager haste, he found a brief letter inclosed, from an ordinary of Newgate, stating that it contained the last dying words of James Maddox, the culprit, who attempted the robbery of Lord Templeton; and who had revived after Clifton's withdrawal from his cell, to the astonishment of the physician and his attendants. The letter closed with the information that the criminal departed this life on the day following, praying with his last breath that the substance of his disclosure might be forwarded to Clifton at the first opportunity; which was not performed in consequence of the absence of the lad who had before called on him, and conducted him to the prison, and who alone knew his place of residence. As will be conceived, our hero lost no time in gaining his lodgings, where he found on his table the cards of Lord Templeton and the Hon. Mr. Courtenay. This unexpected and grateful token of continued regard from the only persons in England whose good opinion he really courted, caused the tears to flow over cheeks unused to the presence of such womanly visitors. As soon as his emotion had subsided, he addressed himself to the packet, and to his astonishment perused the following narrative, which, from its importance to our hero, and its influence on his destinies, deserves to be recorded in a new chapter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol II.—P CHAPTER XIX. THE NARRATIVE. “Let me speak to the yet unknowing world— How these things come about.” Hamlet. As will readily be inferred, the feeble and exhausted condition of the dying culprit prevented him from entering into the minutiæ of his past life and conduct. The communication of the worthy chaplain renders the disclosure somewhat connected and intelligible; but the reader will be compelled to refer to the earlier pages of this history for the re-production of those facts which relate to the career of Maddox, subsequent to the arrest and suicide of Glenthorne. Some disconnected allusions to certain dark transactions in his own after-history are, indeed, furnished, but the strength of the criminal was unequal to the task of completing the gloomy picture. The communication of the chaplain embodies the following recital:— Confession of James Maddox, a prisoner under sentence of death. “My birth-place is the city of Boston, in the State of Massachusetts. “When about the age of twenty-one, I became introduced to Elbert Borrowdale, the son of wealthy parents, recently deceased, in the State of New Hampshire. “This individual was conspicuous for his bold defiance of those moral restraints which are justly regarded with such reverence by all reputable members of society. A few years my senior, and vastly my superior in abilities and mental energy, he soon acquired an ascendency over my feeble nature, which was exercised with despotic sway. “With his only brother, a gentleman possessed of a highly cultivated mind and unspotted reputation, he had entered into a violent personal controversy. “This feud was increased to a deadly hatred by the marriage of his brother with a beautiful and accomplished young lady, of whom Elbert was enamoured. “A fruitless attempt on the virtue of this lady, subsequent to her marriage with his brother, rendering him amenable to punishment, he hastily fled to the Canadas, and the better to elude pursuit, assumed the name of Rupert Glenthorne. “I was the companion of his flight. On his return, I became his accomplice in the abduction of the only child of his brother, a beautiful boy of not more than two years of age. This infamous crime was perpetrated in mid-winter, the child being snatched from the arms of its nurse, while she was amusing herself on a sheet of ice, near the residence of the child's parents. “The shrieks of the nurse alarmed Borrowdale, who seized her by the throat and plunged her head-long into a hole in the ice—while I was removing the infant to our sleigh, which stood at a little distance, shielded from observation by a thick wood. “We fled, and succeeded in effecting our escape with the innocent victim of my relentless associate's vengeance. “In the murder of the nurse I had no direct agency, but conscience, alas! is my accuser—nor will her voice be silent. “But I feel that the lamp of life is fast waning, and must hasten to a close. “Borrowdale, who still retained the assumed name of Glenthorne, and myself separated, nor did we again meet until our last interview in the city of New-York, when the miscreant, by committing a violent assault on my person, provoked a disclosure which caused his arrest, and subsequently induced him to rush, uncalled for, into the presence of his Creator.” The prisoner here became exhausted, and lay for some time in a stupor, from which he was at length aroused by the application of restoratives. “Oh,” he exclaimed, “how fearfully do my crimes rush on my terror-stricken soul! That I have, in part, paid the penalty of my abduction of an innocent child, you will learn when I inform you, that he is no other than Sydney Clifton! through whose instrumentality I am now within the walls of this gloomy prison! If he doubts, let him examine the trinkets which were on his person when stolen from his parents. They will serve to identify him if his parents are still living. I have much more to say—but this room is dark—and I feel the chills of death freezing the blood in my veins. Oh for a few hours to confess my own black transgressions! Alas! alas! they rise up in judgment against me—a dread and dismal array! “But see! yonder stands Rupert Glenthorne beckoning me to his side! and, horror! horror! there approaches the traveller I murdered in cold blood that I might possess his treasure! Away ye ghastly messengers of vengeance! Away! away! take me, oh! take me from this den of demons!” Thus closed the life of this miserable criminal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">P* CHAPTER XX. THE INCOGNITO. “Love me! why, it must be requited.” Much Ado about Nothing. As one partially wakened while under the influence of some dismal and disturbing dream, our hero, with reeling brain and bewildered consciousness, could not for some time collect his scattered thoughts sufficiently to determine whether he had really perused the narrative of Maddox, or whether it was the “baseless fabric” of distempered fancy. When the truth at length burst on his mind in all its strange and sad reality, his emotions were wound to that fearful state of excitement which so nearly approaches the confines of insanity. Overpowered with his reflections he rushed wildly from the house; and unconscious of every thing but the dark impressions that were so deeply stamped on his mind, he strode with rapid steps through street after street, careless whither he strayed or where his wanderings would end. The removal of the stigma which rested on his name, in consequence of his supposed parentage, was to him worse than valueless, coupled as it was with the dread tidings that Julia Borrowdale was his sister! “Why, oh why,” he murmured, “did I so eagerly desire to unveil the secret of my birth? If this horrible reality had been buried with Maddox, I might have enjoyed the dream of love to the close of my earthly career; while Julia would either have been the bride of some more favoured mortal, or remained unmarried for my sake.” Longer reflection caused him to rejoice that he had been unable to procure an interview, which he now determined to avoid. If, after Mr. Borrowdale had returned to America, his mind could be brought to divulge the knowledge of his birth, it could be done by letter, without the necessity of reverting to painful reminiscences. On one thing he was fully determined, and that was to refuse any pecuniary aid from his parents. “If they would not do me the justice,” he continued, “to permit an opportunity for explanation of my conduct, after the service I had rendered Julia, it shall never be said that I received any favour at their hands.” As he passed along one of the streets at the court end of the metropolis, a fashonably attired young lady was seen emerging from a spacious mansion, attended by a footman. Although deeply veiled, the flashing brilliancy of her eyes pierced their gossamer prison, while a well-turned neck, and ancle sufficiently indicated the exquisite symmetry of her graceful form. Notwithstanding the erect carriage and stately movements of the veiled lady were well sustained, yet a close observer might have detected a slight hesitation in her manner, and a wandering of her dark eye to the spot where Clifton was passing. As they both arrived on opposite sides of the street at the corner of another by which it was intersected, Clifton turned to the right, when the lady quickly spoke to her attendant: “Now is the time. Make no mistake—the tall young gentleman in black is the person.” The footman hastily followed in the direction which Clifton had taken, and respectfully touching his hat, asked if he had the honour to address Mr. Sydney Clifton. On his reply in the affirmative the man gave him a sealed note and immediately rejoined his mistress, who had slowly passed on. Clifton lost no time in withdrawing from public view, and entering a neighbouring hotel, called for some slight refreshment, and eagerly opened the letter, which we here transcribe. “Portland Place, April 18. “The writer of this note has, in happier hours, enjoyed brief opportunities of estimating the talents and virtues of Mr. Sydney Clifton. That the impressions left by the slight intercourse were highly flattering to Mr. C. may be inferred from the reception of this unusual solicitation for its renewal. When slander was busy with the name of Mr. Clifton, the writer, whose station in society is inferior to none, formed the bold plan of dragging forth his detractors from their hiding-places, and exposing their infamy to the eyes of an indignant world. Success having attended her efforts, she has visited England to lay her claims before him whose fair fame she can re-establish. Flattering herself that the deep interest thus manifested in Mr. Clifton's welfare will constitute some claims to his regard, the writer is now ready to communicate her knowledge if he feels disposed to make a corresponding return, by uniting his fate to hers for life. Lest the imagination of Mr. Clifton should picture his correspondent in the lineaments of age, it is proper to say that she has numbered fewer years than himself; and if the good-natured world has not descended to egregious flattery, is not deficient in personal attractions. “Knowing the high character of Mr. Clifton, the writer feels confident that if previous engagements preclude the alliance suggested, he will burn this note, and bury its contents in his own bosom; nor seek an interview that will neither retrieve his character nor contribute to his happiness. If, on the contrary, he is desirous of consummating a union on which the happiness of the writer depends, and which she firmly believes will cause no subsequent regrets to either—an interview will be afforded him by calling at No. —, — street at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and inquiring for Miss Williams.” `H.” “To Sydney Clifton, Esq.” This extraordinary epistle excited anew those turbulent emotions which were before gently subsiding in his bosom. Again the charms of Julia occurred to his fancy, arrayed in more attractive colours than they had ever before assumed, causing him to look on the possibility of an alliance with another with sentiments of horror. After he had regained his residence, and attempted to compose his mind, his judgment resumed somewhat of its original sway over his imagination, and he was compelled to confess that if the sacrifice his unknown correspondent demanded at his hands was great, the service she proposed rendering was correspondingly important. And, after all, why would it not be better for all parties that he should at once sever the tie that bound his affections to Julia? Was not the very idea of retaining her love wicked and preposterous? That every principle of honour and rectitude forbade his dwelling on emotions, which, however innocent in their origin, were now without the pale of virtue and principle, was certain; and, after long hesitation, he determined to seek an interview with this unknown correspondent; and after frankly informing her of his love for another, whom circumstances would forever prevent his espousing, place himself at her disposal, if she still considered an alliance desirable with one the first fruits of whose affections were withered at the core. “At least,” he said to himself, “I will stand forth before the world in the majesty of innocence, and if, like Caius Marius amid the ruins of Carthage, I brood over the wreck of all that is dear to memory, the spectacle that I shall present will so thickly cluster with the most elevated moral associations, that he who pauses to sneer will unconsciously tender the tribute of a sigh.” With such consolatory feelings his eyelids at last curtained the hitherto wakeful orbs which they guarded, and the land of dreams was peopled with the same visitants that had been present to his sense during the eventful day, although the part assigned them in the vale of shadows was frequently the opposite of that which was performed by their representatives on earth.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE INTERVIEW. “Good madam, let me see your face.” Twelfth Night. At the appointed hour Clifton, with a heavy heart, proceeded to the place appointed for his interview with the incognita. On knocking at the door and inquiring for Miss Williams, the same footman who had given him the letter on the preceding day, directed his steps into a small room, the furniture of which, to his surprise, bordered on the shabby-genteel, being evidently a part of the ill-matched stock-in-trade of a pawnbroker, or second-hand dealer. In truth, the house and its appurtenances conveyed the idea of poverty striving at display, and Clifton could not but wonder at the circumstance, if, as the writer of the note alleged, she moved in the first circles of New-York society. He had not long pondered on thesubject before the door opened, and a tall and splendidly attired lady entered, her face completely enveloped in the folds of a heavy dark veil. The agitation of our hero's feelings prevented his rising, until the lady had passed before him, when he awkwardly essayed to offer her a chair, although she was already seated on the sofa. “I trust, madam.” he said, as he remained still standing, “that the exciting nature of this interview will be my apology for my lack of courtesy. In truth, lady, I am a most miserable and forlorn being, the spring and elasticity of whose spirit are already broken, and really incapable of making a due return for the condescension and benevolence which have dictated this unlooked for interview. “You see before you, madam, one who has already deeply, fondly, devotedly loved. The being on whom my affections were lavished, although eminently worthy of the admiration and regard of the noblest in the land, is placed beyond the possibility of ever being united to my destinies. Such being the case, you can judge whether the wreck of what was once a heart, susceptible of the warmest sympathies—all of which are now frozen—is worth your acceptance. If, notwithstanding this disclosure, you should still desire to unite your fate with mine, my best exertions will ever be placed in requisition to ensure your happiness.” “Might I inquire,” said the veiled lady, “whether the person of whom you speak is an English, or an American lady?” “She is American,” was the reply. “Her name is Julia Borrowdale!” “Lady, in Heaven's name, speak! when and where did you become acquainted with a secret that I supposed locked in the recesses of my heart of hearts?” Vol. II.—Q “My dear sir, you must recollect, that the eyes of a rival are too piercing to permit communications between lovers to pass unnoticed, when her own heart is deeply interested in the issue. Although at Mrs. Rainsford's soirée you supposed your têtè-u-tête with Julia in the corner of the room unnoticed, there was one pair of eyes that saw your every movement.” “Who and what are you,” said Clifton, “who have thus laid bare my secret thoughts? Your voice has in it something of a remembered tone, but I cannot recall either your person or the time or place of a former meeting. I beseech you, lady, unless you intend to destroy my wits, at once to divulge your name, or unveil your face.” “Fair and softly, my good sir. You forget that I summoned you hither for the purpose of divulging other secrets than those appertaining to my poor self. We will, with your permission, enter into the detail of those matters which still so deeply affect your character. As you have complied with my conditions, I will keep my faith with you, although your affections are more deeply engaged than I imagined. “You no doubt recollect Thomas Burchard, by whose testimony your name became involved with gamblers?” “Too well, lady,” was the response to this question. “From certain indications, unnecessary for me to explain, I became persuaded that Edward De Lyle was the foundation of all your miseries.” “De Lyle!” exclaimed our hero, “impossible!” “Yet a moment, my dear sir, and you will learn your error. Having received full confirmation of my suspicions from the manner of De Lyle himself, I endeavoured to frighten him into a confession; but, although half inclined to make it, he at length mustered courage to avoid the avowal. “I then, by means of anonymous letters, induced Burchard to betray his patron; by which his villany, in reference to yourself, has been disclosed— but to me only—as the immediate cause of his public disgrace had no connection with his malicious attempt to destroy your character.” Here the speaker described minutely the facts with which the reader has been heretofore made acquainted; with the addition of the gratifying information that Ellingbourne had so far recovered from his wound as to visit England for his health, and was then in London. “Ellingbourne alive!” exclaimed Clifton, “this is indeed balm to my wounded spirit. The appearance of his supposed ghost is now explained. Oh lady, you have removed a weight from my soul that almost crushed it.” “And now,” said the incognita, “we will part for the present, as this house is not a fitting place for me to disclose myself to my intended husband. To-morrow evening, at seven o'clock, I shall expect you in Portland Place, and must insist on your not making any attempt, in the mean time, to learn my name, or recognize my person. At the appointed hour you will know both. Till then, adieu!” Here she held out her hand, and his devotion to his former mistress did not prevent him from observing that the hand was right beautiful and exquisite in the symmetry of its minute proportions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. AN UNEXPECTED CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR HERO. “Mal. Some are born great, Some achieve greatness, And some have greatness thrust upon them.” What you will. On returning to his residence, after the trial of the robbers, Lord Templeton informed his daughter of the disclosure of Clifton's supposed parentage. His lordship frankly expressed his admiration of the candour and integrity which evidently stimulated the avowal, and did not fail to deplore the necessity which it imposed on him of severing the intimate relations that he had intended should exist between his deliverer and his family. On retiring to rest, Miss Jerningham pondered deeply on the subject of Clifton's disgrace, but neither her judgment nor her feelings coincided in the supposed necessity of avoiding intercourse with one to whom they were so deeply indebted. A few days subsequently Mr. Courtenay visited the mansion of Lord Templeton, when the generous girl introduced the subject of Clifton's apparent disgrace, and espoused his cause Q* with so much zeal, that both her father and his guest became converts to her opinion, and avowed the intention of renewing their former intercourse. As Clifton sauntered slowly through the streets on the morning following the interview with the veiled lady, he was accosted by the Hon. Mr. Courtenay, who drew up his stanhope to the side walk, and informed our hero that he had a particular request from Lord Templeton and his daughters that he should convey him to their residence whenever he could spare a few hours. “Fortunately,” said Mr. C., “I am now on my way thither, and if you are not particularly engaged, I hope you will bear me company.” Clifton, who had determined to take an early opportunity of divulging the secret of his birth, and soliciting the advice of the noble lord as to the proper course for him to pursue in order to silence the malicious reports that were in circulation in reference to his character and parentage, embraced the offer of his countryman, and they were soon on the road to Lord Templeton's seat. “I feel no little embarrassment,” said Clifton, as they approached the mansion, “in introducing a subject to the notice of Lord Templeton and yourself, which, being solely connected with my own obscure history, can hardly be attended with interest to others whose rank in life is so far above my own. Indeed, were it not necessary to the proper appreciation of one whom you both have distinguished by your notice, I should not venture to bring the topic before you. But here comes Lord Templeton and his daughters down the avenue to meet us, and with your permission we will wait another opportunity to disclose my secret.” As they alighted from the carriage the greeting of Lord Templeton and his lovely daughters was most cordial and ardent, and Clifton felt a certain pride in the thought that he could so effectually remove the stigma that alone cast a shade over the brightness of his character and name. As they all passed up the avenue the ladies made affectionate inquiries into the state of his health, the younger chiding him in her own arch way for his lack of courtesy in not sooner paying them a visit. After reaching the drawing-room, Clifton said: “I must entreat the pardon of my kind friends for relieving my breast of a burthen, with the history of which nothing but your unlooked-for goodness could induce me to trouble you. I need not say that I left the court-room on the day of trial with feelings nearly akin to despair. To be compelled by my regard for truth to avow a connexion which covered me with unmerited ignominy, was, as you may imagine, gall and wormwood to my soul. But as has been my practice, I at once preferred the dictates of truth to motives of expediency, and unhesitatingly stated my honest convictions of my birth and parentage. But, my friends, I know you will rejoice to hear that I laboured under an error. Fortunately I am not the child of Glenthorne, the murderer and suicide.” Here he related all the circumstances which had so recently come to his knowledge, and which so completely exonerated him from all the imputations that had rested on his name. The recital drew tears from the eyes of the gentle-hearted ladies, and the gentlemen themselves did not listen unmoved. “But,” said Lord Templeton, “there is one fact connected with this narration which has not yet fully been confirmed, but which will, I suspect, create a still deeper interest in those whom you have laid so deeply under obligation. The patronymic of my maternal ancestors is Borrowdale, and my mother's father was named Elbert Borrowdale, the same as that of the unhappy man whose crimes brought him to a premature end. My mother's brother emigrated to America before the revolution, and as he bore the name of James, which is the same as Clifton's father's, I see little cause to doubt the fact of our near relationship. From information obtained years since, I was induced to believe all the descendants of the family in America dead, but the circumstances detailed by Maddox furnish a clew to their disappearance.” Clifton then produced from his pocket the bracelets that were on his arms when stolen from his parents, and they were decorated with the ancestral insignia of the Borrowdale family. This settled the question to the satisfaction of all. “Papa,” said the younger Miss Jerningham, “what shall we call Mr. Clifton now? I mean to call him Cousin Sydney, as that is a much prettier name than either Clifton or Borrowdale.” Lord Templeton and Mr. Courtenay were not a little amused at the claims to Clifton's relationship presented by Miss Euphemia, who, finding them all smiling, blushed and said, “Well, I don't care if you do laugh. He is my cousin, and I don't see any reason why I should'nt call him Cousin Sydney.” “My sweet child,” said Lord Templeton, “you certainly have the right to address our young relative by the name you propose, if he has no objection to the familiarity.” “I am too much honoured already by the kindness of your lordship's family,” answered Clifton: “if our newly ascertained relationship is recognized, it will add to the gratification on my part, to be addressed by the title of cousin by my charming young friend.” “But, Mr. Clifton, as I still inadvertently call him,” rejoined Lord Templeton, “is not aware of the enviable rank that Euphemia assigns him in the literary world. She declares her unalterable conviction that he is none other than the unknown author of `Fatality,' and the `Conscience Stricken;' and so impressed is her imagination with the truth of this conjecture, that she has laid violent hands on the magazines containing the two popular tales, and I have been compelled to promise a splendid binding for them. I learn that her views on this delicate subject are formed from some peculiar expressions in the tales which were used by our relative while temporarily residing with us. That there is something in the coincidence is, I think, certain, for even our clear headed Adeline joins Euphemia in this opinion.” “While at the confessional,” replied our hero, “I may as well make a clean breast of it, and admit my literary offences, that my absolution may be complete. My cousin Euphemia must be awarded the medal for her discrimination, as she has undoubtedly detected the visage of the man in the mask. Her opinion is authority on this matter, and if she had been a native of America, her guessing powers could not have been improved.” Lord Templeton urged Clifton to remain at least for a time at his house, but he excused himself on the plea that he had an engagement in town which he must fulfil. In communicating his history to Lord Templeton and his daughters, he had entirely avoided any reference to his engagement with the unknown lady, or his affection for Julia Borrowdale. The circumstance of his being a relative of Lord Templeton will not surprise the reader, if he reverts to the sketch of Mr. Borrowdale's history in the earlier pages of this work. Their noble host, finding that Mr. Courtenay and Sydney were soon to depart, proposed a stroll through the highly cultivated grounds, Miss Jerningham accepting the proferred arm of Mr. Courtenay, while Euphemia hung delighted on that of her new found cousin. As they strolled down the gravelled walks whose sides were decorated with the most beautiful and rare flowers and luxuriant foliage, our hero saw with gratification that his eldest cousin and Mr. Courtenay were inclined to wander from their companions; and from certain indications which could scarcely be mistaken, he rightly judged that all-powerful love had entered into the bosoms of both. For Mr. Courtenay he entertained the most exalted respect, and rejoiced that he had found so congenial a spirit to minister to his wishes, and cheer him with her affection. As they passed onward, Lord Templeton, who was by the side of Sydney, stopped to give the gardener some necessary directions, when Euphemia remarked in a low tone of voice: “Cousin Sydney, I just now heard papa telling Mr. Courtenay that you would become heir to his title and estates if you proved your descent. I know they mean to keep it a secret till you bring the proofs, but I thought I must tell you in confidence. So, my good cousin, keep the secret close, nor let me get into disgrace by my wish to make you happy.” “You are the sweetest, dearest cousin that ever man possessed,” he replied, “and I would sooner fight the robbers over again than divulge a word. Do you remember how you used to take my crutch, and limp like me down the garden walks?” “Yes, yes, I think I do, and what's more, I have your crutch locked up in my closet safe and sound. I told papa the other day that I prized it more than the lady-love of Richard the lion-hearted did his great sword.” “I see,” said our hero, “that I shall have to write you a new song commemorative of my crutch and your constancy.” After an hour spent in delightful converse, which for the time went far to relieve the sorrowful feelings of Sydney, Mr. Courtenay ordered his stanhope, and they departed. To Lord Templeton's earnest request for an early visit, his relative acceded, promising in a very few days to make his re-appearance. As the vehicle was about moving, Euphemia called to the postilion to stop a moment, when she peeped roguishly into the vehicle, and in an authoritative tone bade her cousin Sydney not forget the promised song. Away dashed the spirited steeds and in a short space of time our newly-named hero was sitting in his own apartments, awaiting with no little anxiety the issue of the interview with his fair unknown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. THE MEETING—THE UNVEILING—THE DENOUEMENT. “Alone with him! how many a month hath past, Though we are still so young, since we have met, Which I have worn in widowhood of heart. He speaks not—scarce regards me—not a word— Nor look—yet he was soft of voice and aspect.” Sardanapalus. The reader, whose patience has sustained him thus far in our company, will have found little difficulty in identifying the lady, whose envious veil so sorely puzzled our bewildered hero. As Helen Elwell is therefore unhooded to those of us who are behind the curtain, it is proper to revert to the causes which induced her visit to London, and instigated the adoption of such bold and novel measures to secure the affections and person of him whom she only knew as Sydney Clifton. After her last anonymous epistle to Thomas Burchard had accomplished its purpose, she despatched a messenger to that worthy, soliciting his presence at a certain hour at her father's residence. The summons was obeyed, and by dint of promises Vol. II—R and threats she induced him to disclose the subtle scheme which accomplished the destruction of Clifton's character, and in which De Lyle had played so conspicuous a part. In truth, Burchard was totally unaware of Ellingbourne's privity to the original plan, and therefore attributed its inception, progress, and completion, solely to the teeming brain of De Lyle. As will be inferred, Helen's desire to be the sole depository of Burchard's secret, until she could avail herself of the information, and thus secure Clifton's hand—was cheerfully seconded by her informant, who was more deeply implicated in the matter than he wished the public to understand. Shortly subsequent to this development, and while she was yet pondering on the most feasible method of rendering it subservient to her purpose, a letter from Julia imparted the intention of her parents to make a voyage to Europe for the benefit of her health; and soliciting Mr. Elwell to secure their passage in a packet that would sail on the following month. To the jealous mind of Helen this visit to England foreboded the destruction of her cherished schemes, if she could not anticipate her cousin, by herself embarking in a vessel which sailed previous to that in which the Borrowdale's intended to take passage. Fortunately for her design, an intimate friend of her father designed, with his lady, to sail for Liverpool in the succeeding week, and her father's consent was obtained and her passage engaged before she disclosed the receipt of her cousin's letter. Although the vessel in which Helen embarked preceded that in which her cousin sailed nearly two weeks, yet they both arrived in London at about the same time; and Helen's desire to anticipate Julia induced her to seek an interview with Clifton in the manner before related. The following morning she devoted to the return of calls from the friends of the high-born family at whose residence she remained while in London. While at the mansion of a lady of fashion at the west and of the town, the name of Lord Templeton was accidentally introduced, which led to some remarks connected with the trial of the culprit who attempted his robbery on the highway. The introduction of this subject caused the gallantry and prowess of Clifton to be justly lauded; and all expressed their regret that the unfortunate incident in the trial had compelled him to avow the disgrace attached to his wretched parent. Helen's recent arrival in London had prevented her from before learning ought of the infamy belonging to our hero's parentage; nor was she prepared by any previous knowledge of the circumstances, connected with Glenthorne's history, or his relationship to Clifton, to anticipate the disgrace thus reflected on the latter. To her chagrin and mortification the fashionable society of the British metropolis appeared unanimous in the decision, that our luckless hero had forfeited all claims to consideration by this development. To one who, like Helen Elwell, lived and moved and had her being in the sunshine of fashionable life, no calamity could be more dreaded than expulsion from its charmed boundaries. While her passion for Clifton had led her to adopt rash and somewhat dangerous measures to secure his affections, she was buoyed by anticipations of ultimate success, and stimulated by the romantic nature of the schemes which her inventive genius had moulded to her purpose. But now the case was materially changed. The anxieties and hopes which preceded the success of her plans were merged in their fruition, and the excitement of the chase was no longer sustained by the ardour of pursuit. With such views and feelings it is not surprising that the anticipated union with Clifton assumed a far less attractive aspect to her mind, than when, flushed with the triumph of her schemes, she had in the morning left the residence of her friend to make the round of fashionable visits. To increase her repugnance to so ill-assorted an union, the fashionable male triflers, whom she met in the drawing rooms of her new friends did not conceal their admiration of the tall and graceful transatlantic beauty. Their compliments were not thrown away upon her to whom they were addressed; and long before the arrival of the hour for her interview with Clifton, she had determined to refuse the nuptials she had but now so sedulously laboured to perfect. In accomplishing her newly formed purpose, the presence and co-operation of Julia were requisite; as it occurred to her mind that a most rare opportunity was presented to affect great disinterestedness and magnanimity, in resigning to her cousin the hand of one whom she had rescued from infamy; and for whom she entertained such exalted sentiments of respect. With these views, she invited Julia to call on her for a short period at six o'clock, as she desired to consult her on the subject of some new dresses, and had other arrangements to perfect which required the presence of her cousin. Poor Clifton, as the hour of appointment drew nigh, felt more and more the sacrifice he was called on to make, in thus uniting himself to a female with whose habits, dispositions and temper he must from necessity be unacquainted. In every view it seemed little better than moral prostitution; nor could his judgment reconcile the measures the incognita had adopted with the dictates of female delicacy and decorum. The beautiful lines of Byron, which we transcribe, (slightly altered,) occurred to his mind; and the aptness and force with which they illustrated his unfortunate union with one whom he neither loved nor esteemed, still further depressed his drooping spirits: “Oh, hard it is that fondness to sustain, And struggle not to feel averse in vain: But harder still the heart's recoil to bear, And hide from one, perhaps another there;— R* She takes the hand I give not, nor withhold, Its pulse not checked—nor quickened—calmly cold; And when resigned, it drops a lifeless weight From one I never loved enough to hate. No warmth these lips return by her's imprest, And chilled remembrance shudders o'er the rest.” To his excited mind it appeared that the avoidance of this unfortunate alliance would bring comparative happiness, but he saw no prospect of such a boon, consistent with his solemn obligation. In this sombre mood he traversed the distance between his lodgings and the splendid mansion which his unknown fair one inhabited; and any one not initiated in the secrets of his visit, would have deemed his attendance rather demanded by the exigencies of a funeral, than the expected solemnization of his own nuptial rites. On entering the dwelling he was ushered into a superb drawing room, whose rich furniture was arranged with that nice discrimination which exhibits the highest evidence of decorative taste. In a few moments the door opened and exhibited to his astonished view the person of Helen Elwell! The appearance of a near relative and avowed friend of his adored Julia again awoke all his more painful emotions, and it was with much hesitation that he was enabled to tender the greeting which circumstances rendered necessary. “Truly, Mr. Clifton, for a gallant and courteous young gentleman, you are, methinks, somewhat ungraceful in paying your devoirs to your lady-love. But never mind, you'll improve, I have no doubt, in good time.” These remarks were uttered with what was intended for a gracious smile; but to a scrutinizing observer it ill-concealed the mortified vanity of the belle, who resents a slight none the less that the guilty party is soon to be numbered among her rejected admirers. “Fair and beautiful lady,” said Clifton, “forgive me now, and consider me as I am, a sad and solitary being, who, although grateful for your unlooked-for kindness, am really unable at the moment to render a suitable return. Believe me, my dear Miss Elwell, that none can more fully appreciate the sacrifice you have made to rescue my reputation from undeserved reproach, nor am I either indifferent to or ungrateful for the boon. That the lady who thus interested herself in the fate of so obscure an individual would be found in the person of the high-born, accomplished and fascinating Miss Elwell, was, I confess, totally unexpected; and my embarrassment and hesitation are the natural result of so great a surprise.” “How beautiful and intellectual is his fine dark eye, and his voice is music itself.” Thus thought Helen Elwell; and she sighed as she reflected on his loss of caste in the only world within whose glittering circle she wished to move. The well-timed compliments of our re-assured hero summoned a more genuine smile than its ill-favoured predecessor, and Helen replied: “Before we proceed to extremities, it will be necessary to consult a friend in the next room; and I must beg of you to pay the most respectful attention to the advice thus given.” With these words she moved toward a pair of folding doors, beckoning Clifton at the same time to join her; and as he came to her side she took his arm, threw open the doors, and exhibited to his astonished gaze the ever-remembered and beloved form of Julia Borrowdale! To paint the varied emotions that rushed through the breasts of both at this unexpected meeting, is beyond our art; nor could we more successfully attempt to depict its effect on their agitated countenances. With Julia indeed all within was joy—turbulent, uncontrollable, unspeakable delight;—but Clifton's brain reeled, and his mind was overwhelmed with the painful conviction that he was in the presence of one, who, though dearer to his heart than the purple current which controlled its beatings, and was removed from his alliance by insurmountable barriers. The impress of those terrible regrets was so visible on his features, that even Helen with all her stoicism hastened to remove what she conceived was the cause of his sorrows, by resigning him formally to Julia. The only word that yet passed, were “Mr. Clifton here!” by Julia, and “Miss Borrowdale!” by her stricken admirer, who recoiled as if stung by an adder as he uttered her name. To Julia this hesitation and recoil were viewed with dreadful forebodings, for the only circumstance which could justify his backwardness to address her was, she deemed, his betrothal to another! “Come, come, my dear young couple,” were Helen's words, “this shyness would be in the very worst taste, if I had not by a little well-contrived artifice been guilty of implanting it in the bosom of Mr. Clifton. To be brief, for I really detest what are called `scenes,' I have thrown a most beautifully wrought net over this inconsolable lover of yours, Julia, and he flutters dreadfully in its meshes. Well, well, I'll be magnanimous, and release him. There now the story is told, and if you two do not hereafter be happy as the day is long, it will be no fault of `mine.' ” To the surprise of Helen, and the infinite horror of her cousin, Clifton, instead of proceeding to clasp Julia to his bosom, retreated into the recesses of a heavily-cased window, threw himself on a seat, and groaned in very bitterness of spirit. How long he would have remained there it is impossible to say, if Helen had not insisted on his instantly explaining his extraordinary conduct. “This,” said she, “is a most unaccountable and unpardonable affront to my charming cousin, and were I a man you should answer it with your life. No one with a drop of my blood in their veins shall be thus treated with impunity; and I tell you Mr. Sydney Clifton, that you will forfeit all claims to the character of a gentleman, if you do not this moment explain the cause of this coldness.” This spirited remonstrance had the desired effect, and rising, Clifton, with extreme pallor of countenance, said: “Miss Elwell you are right, and I submit to the reproof, conscious that it is apparently deserved. When my traitor tongue shall sufficiently return to its allegiance to explain the barrowing nature of my reflections, and their distressing cause, I trust that my offence will be considered more venial. That I love Miss Borrowdale madly, devotedly, you I presume well know. That I can never wed her you will learn when I divulge a secret that it was my intention never to communicate while we were both in one hemisphere. The present crisis however, demands the disclosure at my hands, and I will essay its revelation. It is probably known by this time to you both, that I was compelled recently in open court—in the presence of a large auditory—to avow my belief that I was the offspring of Glenthorne the murderer. This circumstance has attained great notoriety; and if it had been confirmed by the event, would have banished me from the society of a large circle of the respectable portion of this community. “Unhappily for my peace, this is not the case. I am not the child of disgrace and infamy; but what is to me infinitely more to be deplored, I am the son of Mr. Borrowdale and the brother of Julia! “If fate has in store for me hereafter any exquisite misery—such as mortal never yet endured without flinching—believe me it will fail to extort one token of regret. The present calamity is, in its ocean-like boundary, destined to engulph all present and future pangs.” During this astounding recital, the countenance of Helen unconsciously brightened, as she reflected that now the barrier was removed—the goal in view —the triumph achieved! “He is mine—mine for life—mine for time—mine for eternity,” were her thoughts. At the close of Clifton's address Julia swooned, and it was some time before she revived. As soon as her returning animation permitted she feebly said, “My dear cousin, and you, Mr. Clifton, excuse my emotion. I have for months been ill—very ill —and am now but partially recovered, and my nerves are sadly shattered. The extraordinary disclosure of Mr. Clifton, as I will yet call him, overcame me; but happily he labours under an error of which probably my good cousin has herself yet to learn the correction; as her residence at a distance from us, and the desire of both my respected more than parents to conceal the fact, have caused all our friends to consider me as their daughter, which I am only by adoption. When Mr. Borrowdale lost his only son and child, he was on the eve of removing to his residence near Boston; and although his intimate friends were aware of his loss, yet they all were ignorant of the fact that a couple in Boston died leaving me in the care of my kind foster parents. With all our friends, therefore, I pass as their child, but I will say it—although it is almost unmaidenly for me to utter it—I now rejoice that I am capable of returning the love of my ever-loved and fondly-cherished Sydney. That my dearly-loved foster parents will hail this development with rapture, is a better cause for my rejoicing, as it is less selfish.” At this explanation being given, the enraptured Clifton caught his intended bride to his arms, and we much fear that their embrace was more ardent, and continued a greater length of time, than would be sanctioned by the arbiters of taste in fashionable society. While this happy denouement was in progress, the crest-fallen Helen could not conceal her mortification, and made several ill-natured remarks, calculated to injure the feelings of Julia. Clifton, she insisted, was still bound by his promise to her, not to wed another; and she thought the opinion of the world ought to be respected, even if it were true, that Julia was not the daughter of Mr. Borrowdale; although she must say she looked with some little suspicion on a disclosure which lacked proof, and was uttered just at the critical moment. To these evidences of chagrin, Clifton mildly replied, that he partook of Julia's evident surprise and regret that Miss Elwell should so far forget herself as to venture the ill-natured remarks that had fallen from her lips. If Miss Elwell had, when he was considered the child of disgrace, continued to claim the fulfilment of his promise, he would certainly have kept it to the letter. But she had released him from it, and he regretted to find her apparent magnanimity mere pretence. The entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Borrowdale caused a suspension of this by-play. Mr. Borrowdale, on recognizing Clifton with great frankness and affability offered him his hand. “Mr. Clifton,” said he, “I trust you will pardon me for not tendering you a friendly salutation at the review a few days since. “The honest truth is, that some circumstances connected with your history required satisfactory elucidation, before I felt warranted in resuming our former intimacy; and I did not conceive either the time or place of our casual meeting proper for that purpose. To convince you, however, that I was not disposed to condemn a friend unheard, I will state, that I yesterday made inquiry at the office of the American minister for your residence, and have this moment returned from your lodgings. Whether your version of the late difficulties which so deeply involved your moral character is acceptable or otherwise will, of course, influence my future conduct towards you; although I will freely confess, that my prejudices were somewhat enlisted in opposition to the belief of your innocence. “The facts connected with the late avowal of your Vol. II.—S unfortunate descent, have caused me to doubt the truth of my former suspicions; as a frank disclosure of circumstances, where concealment was attended with no hazard, and their avowal cast unmerited obloquy, could not be the emanation of a corrupt heart. “From these remarks you will perceive, that you can now venture your explanations, with the certainty that they will meet an impartial judgment.” “I will not,” replied our hero, “conceal my gratification at this unlooked-for condescension and friendship. That the slanders heaped on my reputation in New-York were the foul emanations of a guilty wretch, who hoped thereby to screen himself from the consequences of his crimes, Miss Elwell will inform you. To her, indeed, I owe more than language can express—and I trust, notwithstanding the unkind words which inadvertently dropped from me in a moment of forgetfulness, that she will not refuse me the privilege of hereafter addressing her by the endearing title of friend.” “All is forgotten that can in any way affect our friendly intercourse,” replied Helen, with a ghastly smile. The artful girl saw, on a moment's reflection, that she occupied a false position, and hastened with the best grace she could assume, to regain the ground she had lost. “Mr. Clifton,” she resumed, “is innocent of every charge brought against his character, and at a more fitting period, I will explain the manner in which suspicion was made to fall upon him.” As she concluded, Mr. and Mrs. Borrowdale both clasped Clifton's hand with great cordiality, and expressed their joy at the result of this brief conference. “But,” said Clifton, “I have still farther developments to make, and as the evening is wearing apace, must hasten to the denouement of my history. Does Mr. Borrowdale recognize these childish ornaments?” Here he produced the bracelets which he had kept about his person from the period of his learning their importance in establishing his identity. As Mrs. Borrowdale caught a sight of them, she rushed forward with the most intense anxiety depicted in her countenance, exclaiming, “Oh, Mr. Clifton! say—where, oh where did you procure these bracelets? For heaven's sake speak, or I shall sink at your feet.” “They are mine, dearest mother! they are my own!” he replied, and rushed to her embrace. To describe the rapture of all, if we except the mortified Helen, requires a more graphic pen than ours. Suffice it, that the overjoyed parents would not permit their long-lost son to sleep, even for a night, beneath any other roof than that which sheltered themselves and Julia; and after Sydney had related the interview with Lord Templeton, in which that nobleman claimed relationship with his new found parent and himself—and the detail of which still further vexed and chagrined the crest-fallen Helen—his parents, Julia, and himself, ordered the carriage, and returned to the hotel of the former. Were it honourable to disclose the movements of lovers in a star-light evening—when they both occupied the same seat in a coach—we might relate how Sydney, as soon as they were seated, threw his arm around the slender waist of his mistress—how she neither chided him for his boldness, nor endeavoured to moderate the warmth of his embrace— how, by some magnetic influence, their lips were mutually attracted, until they united in a long, long kiss!—how Julia's head, becoming weary, fell, unconsciously, on her lover's shoulder—how he lost what little senses were left him, and imagined it was all a dream—and how his fond parents, finding they could make nothing of his incoherent replies to their questions, smiled and were silent. All this and much more than this, passed on their return to Mr. Borrowdale's hotel; but we will not imitate those busy-bodies, who appear born to meddle with matters in which they have no concern, and are forever setting the world at odds by their tattling propensity. All, therefore, that we shall narrate is, that after they had arrived at their destination, Julia and Clifton became mysteriously enamoured of gazing at the stars; and, standing at an open window, continued to watch those burning orbs that hang like diamonds in the azure sky—until their parents reminded them that it was past the hour of midnight, and that if they expected to view the sun on the next day, it would be advisable to leave the stars for a season to their accustomed solitude. This reasonable advice was followed, and we leave them to enjoy that repose which the eventful scenes through which they had so rapidly passed rendered not unwelcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">S* CHAPTER XXIV. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE FACILITY WITH WHICH COMEDY CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO TRAGEDY. “And every where huge covered tables stood, With wines high-flavoured and rich viands crowned; Whatever sprightly juice or tasteful food On the green bosom of this earth is found.” “While ravens sung Their funeral dirge.” Thomson. In an elaborately furnished apartment of Fenton's Hotel, in London, three gentlemen were seated over their wines and walnuts after dinner. The individual whose liberality had, like the lamp of Alladin, brought this banquet into being, was seated at the head of the table, sipping his Burgundy with that exquisite sense of enjoyment which causes one to linger fondly over the purple luxury, and sigh when our lip and the chrystal rim are doomed to separation. This bountiful provider was still young, and the skill and taste of the most celebrated Schneider of the metropolis were exhibited in his apparel. “Come, come, mon beau garcon,” said he, to a gentleman at his right, whose pale features exhibited the traces of recent illness; “you don't sustain your well-earned reputation. If the Burgundy palls try the champagne. I'll warrant it better than the real article. To whet your appetite for the wine, I'll give you a toast which will render even acid Rhenish palatable. Here's to an old comrade, Edward De Lyle.” “Before I respond to your toast it may be well to premise that De Lyle is no longer tolerated in New-York circles. “He's cut by universal consent, and has found it convenient to become an emigré. His little peccadillos have qualified him to enjoy the otium cum dignitate in the white mansion at Sing Sing, if the British government should repudiate his alliance. I'm told London has now the honour of his company. Your late sojourn in Paris has prevented your knowledge of these facts.” “Why this is news. Matthison, my boy, here's to philosophy. If you visit Paris I'll give you an introduction to the Chevalier De Roussilon, who reverses your theory, and believes in the supremacy of the feet. In short, he commenced as a dancing master and retires as a philosopher; believing most devoutly that no man of genius exists who is not qualified to trip on the light fantastic toe.” “The fellow is mad,” grumbled Matthison, who did not precisely relish the association, and who was moreover, rapidly approximating to that state of unconsciousness which is aptly described by the words “gloriously fuddled.” “Shafton, my boy, your stomach is disordered, or you could not thus have forgotten yourself in wishing me to become introduced to a fellow whose heels take rank above his understanding. I desire to be courteous, but must say that there is a certain meteoric wildness in your eye, indicative of disease in the epigastric region. Try abstinence as I do. If you don't follow my sober example your wit will flash in the pan—your puns be execrable—your satire will fall still-born—your ideas become foggy and your sentiments mawkish. So my boy attend to the grand regulator. What say you Julius? Won't my philosophy astonish the John Bulls? Hah, Julius?” “Matthison,” said Ellingbourne, “you have evidently mixed your wines and become non compos. For a quiet respectable citizen of the Empire State you're rather out of character to-day.” “No reflections,” said Shafton. “Our friend is looking you in the face and imagines it a mirror, and if its polish was transferred to your manners the improvement would be apparent. But I beg pardon. Did I perpetrate a good thing? If I did I was oblivious—I was on my honour.” With this the speaker again threw himself back in his chair—elevated his goblet to a level with his face—touched his lip to the rim—half closed his dull grey eyes, and appeared like one whose thoughts having started on a voyage of discovery had not yet returned to their listless owner. Slowly removing the attractive liquid, he resumed, “But let us into the secrets of Gotham, for it is three months since my carrier pigeon has visited its owner. By the way, as I passed through the strand this morning I saw an old gentleman whose physiognomy bore a strong resemblance to that of Isaac Samuel, our Israelitish usurer. His beard was as long as a goat's, which, with his dishevelled grey locks, was calculated somewhat to disguise his features; but had I met him in Wall-street, I'd have sworn to him, beard and all.” “What,” replied Ellingbourne, “the Jew here? then De Lyle will never return to America in a whole skin. You must know that he tickled the fancy of Samuel's daughter under an assumed name, and when all was discovered, the love sick maiden took it into her head to die. The old dotard is fool enough to think it was all for love; so he has tracked De Lyle here, who, in addition to jilting the girl, owes her father some twenty thousand dollars.” “Oh, aye, I perceive,” said Shafton; “the Jew's cunning has converted the debt into a debt of honour. So pay up you rascal, or pistols for two. That his regard for his daughter would make him push De Lyle to extremities I don't believe a word of. But if money is in the way, the game's up with our outlawed chum.” “Pooh, pooh, you thick-headed pair, leave talking about Jews and Gentiles, and listen to my philosophy. You think I don't know what I am about, but I'm trying the grand experiment, by getting a little inebriated. The thing works to a charm. Every time I get fuddled I regularly attempt to achieve great things—and I always fail—and why? Because the stomach is assaulted and undermined and overthrown and upset. So the proof of the pudding is in swallowing the wine. If I get under the table report me truly. Here's your health—hiccup —call the waiter. Waiter put these two intoxicated yankee gentlemen to bed. They are pretty decent when sober, but great blockheads when they're drunk. Waiter bring me three looking glasses, so that I may reflect on these drunken philosophers. Why Elly, my boy, is that you? I took you for the waiter. If you put on a clean apron you'll do. I'll sing you a song—hiccup—a philosophical ditty. When Bonaparte his race began, His stomach was in trim, sir, His cup of glory soon o'er-ran Its sparkling chrystal brim, sir. But now dyspepsia, night-mare like, The seat of know ledge pressed, sir:— His conquering arm forgets to strike— You surely know the rest, sir. Their health and cheer—to all that's here, We trust their name is legion— No tears they'll weep if sound they keep The epigastric region. Chorus. No tears they'll weep if sound they keep The epigastric region. “Why don't you sing the cho-cho-rus—the chorus-hiccup.” Here the oblivious philosopher dropped his chin on his breast, and was soon performing a solo on the nasal organ. The apartment in which the dinner was served communicated with a balcony which extended along the front of the building directly in view of the street, and Shafton and Ellingbourne passed through the window to inhale the delicious evening breeze, leaving Matthison to his repose. As they reached that part of the balcony which overlooked the side-walk in front of the hotel—the sudden report of a pistol beneath them attracted their notice, and was soon succeeded by a second; and on leaning over the iron railing, they perceived two individuals prostrated on the pavement and weltering in their blood, As may be supposed, they both rushed to the spot, and to their infinite amazement and horror, beheld the mangled remains of De Lyle and the Jew. From the statement of individuals who saw the transaction, it appeared that Samuel had confronted his victim—taken deliberate aim at his heart; and when the fatal messenger had accomplished the death of De Lyle—with a second weapon finished his own earthly carees. While standing over the bodies Mr. Borrowdale and his long lost son entered the circle of lookers-on, who surrounded the inanimate remains of the murderer and his victim. Ellingbourne first recognized our hero, and immediately tendered him a cordial salutation. “I trust,” he said, “that Mr. Clifton has ere this learned the facts connected with the cause of our unfortunate altercation. If so, it will be unnecessary for me to allude to the hapless wretch who lies at our feet.” “All has been explained to my perfect satisfaction,” replied Clifton, “and I most sincerely rejoice that your recovery has placed it in my power to apologize for my rashness and folly. If we are not hereafter friends, it will not be through any fault of mine.” As Shafton perceived that Ellingbourne was satisfied with the position Clifton now occupied, he deemed it safe also to exhibit tokens of recognition; and Mr. Borrowdale being introduced by our hero as his new found father, the cordiality of Shafton's manner was marvellously heightened, and he insisted on enjoying the society of Mr. Borrowdale and his son at his room. This proposition being acceded to, they were all soon seated at the table, and after a sufficient time had elapsed to restore Matthison to consciousness, he was aroused from his slumbers and formally introduced to Sydney as Mr. Borrowdale. Rubbing his eyes, and taking a second look, he said: “I beg this young gentleman's pardon, but had I met him in any other place I should have taken him for an old acquaintance. Mr. Ellingbourne, does not the younger Mr. Borrowdale strongly resemble Mr. Clifton?” “Not in the least,” said Ellingbourne; “Mr. Shafton, do you detect any resemblance between Mr. Borrowdale and Mr. Clifton?” “Why, it is possible that there may be a very slight resemblance; and as our friend looks through a pair of coloured glasses, it is not astonishing that their hue should deceive him. Such things have happened before.” Throwing himself back in the chair, Matthison gave a long look at our hero, saying, “Well, this is strange. I must be out of tune, or I couldn't make such a mistake. Mr. Clifton—I beg pardon, Mr. Borrowdale—you don't drink— that's positively unkind—Sydney my boy—I beg pardon, Mr. Borrowdale—my respects to you.” “Mr. Borrowdale must remember the fate of Pentheus,” said Ellingbourne, with a smile. “The devotees at the shrine of Bacchus are proverbially bigots, and the fate of the Theban king is a warning to all modern offenders.” After the lapse of some hours the arrival of the coroner was announced, and on the appearance of the jury the party descended to the apartment in which lay the mutilated remains of Samuel and De Lyle. The first individual who attracted the attention of Sydney was the identical little philanthropist with the huge nose, whose interference at the trial of Maddox caused the disclosure of his supposed parentage. This eccentric individual, who possessed a competent Vol. II.—T. income, appeared but to live in the atmosphere of criminal proceedings. When the judicial tribunals were not in session, he was a frequent attendant on the inquests of the coroner, who had initiated him in propriety of demeanour by rewarding his loquacity on a previous occasion, with a committal for contempt. From the testimony of an individual who had detected, in the movements of the Jew, something extraordinary, it appeared, that after following De Lyle for some distance, he had accosted him just as his person became clearly visible by the light of the lamps before the hotel, and on the latter's turning, he shouted with the fury of a demon, “Fiend! I have you now, and the devil whom you serve cannot save you from my vengeance. Remember Rachel Samuel! Your last hour is come! Down, down to that hell which yawns to receive you!” With these words he fired the pistol, and in another moment turned its fellow against his own breast. Matthison, whose artificial elevation caused him to take a more prominent part in the proceedings than he would otherwise have cared to assume, voluntarily presented himself as a witness; and went into a full detail of the causes which engendered the fierce hostility of the Jew against De Lyle. After he had quitted the stand, Mr. Marlow elbowed his way towards him, and soliciting an interview for a moment in another apartment of the inn, which was granted, said, “My name, sir, is Marlow—Job Marlow, at your service. As I have now in press a luminous history of the most expert heroes of the road, and the most skilful geniuses who have ever figured in any of those walks in life which rendered them amenable to the meshes in which society contrives to entangle bold innovators—I take the liberty of soliciting your address, that I may hereafter have the pleasure of waiting on you and learning some further particulars concerning the two unhappy gentlemen whose career is just closed.” “Mr. Marlow—Mr. Job Marlow, permit me to return your salutation,” said Matthison, throwing what was intended to be a knowing leer towards Ellingbourne, but which to the uninitiated appeared more like the inebriated distortion of the speaker's countenance, “my desire to serve you, and at the same time to sub-serve the cause of science impels me to solicit a survey of the surface of your tongue; and you will therefore particularly oblige me, and render philosophy an eminent service by exhibiting that appendage to your mouth for a moment. In other words, as my friend Dr. Crabbe would say, `stick out your tongue,' Mr. Marlow—Mr. Job Marlow.” Our nasal friend, not a little astounded, and somewhat irritated at this novel request, drew back with evident marks of dissatisfaction. Observing the rising ire of Mr. Marlow, the theorist addressed him thus: “Keep cool, my dear sir—keep cool. You have no idea of the injury you will inflict on the grand regulator by permitting yourself to fly into a rage. Whatever you may suppose, I assure you that it is of the utmost importance that you should grant my request. Sir, I am a gentleman, and a philanthropist, and at this moment an exile from my country, solely through my desire to investigate a moral and physical phenomenon, the enigma of whose wonderful effects on the human character it is my purpose to reveal. You, sir, are also a searcher into the mysterious depths of the human mind; and the originality of your views alone renders you a subject worthy of my attention. If, therefore, you desire to extend the researches of mental philosophy into regions hitherto unexplored—if you wish your name coupled with a work destined for immortality—if, hereafter, you expect to rank among the magnates of the literary world—show me your tongue.” Warmed with the wine he had drunk, and heated by his desire to impress on honest Job's mind the importance of his request, he concluded his address with a flourish of his hand, which, to his hearer's mind, appeared the perfection of oratorical action. The respectful searcher after criminal records bowed most complacently, and immediately extended his tongue. “'Tis well,” said Matthison, with inimitable gravity, “my theory cannot lie. Sir, you are a great genius in your way, and here is my address.” The solemn interest created in the heart of Clifton at the shocking spectacle before him, (which was not unfelt by Ellingbourne and Shafton,) rendered Matthison's absence, in company with Marlow, unperceived; nor would the theorist have been guilty of such unseemly indifference and levity, had not his senses been bewildered by the depth of his potations. At length our hero and his happy parent departed. Matthison was conducted to his lodgings by Ellingbourne. Shafton proceeded to the opera. The crowd dispersed, and the bodies of the wretched suicide and his victim were consigned to the undertaker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">T* CHAPTER XXV. THE FINALE. “Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance, but to hear The story of your loves discovered.” Two Gentlemen of Verona. The fortunes of our hero and his beloved Julia having reached their zenith, and the destiny of those whose fate was linked with theirs being fixed for good or ill, it behoves us, with them, to retire from the scene, nor linger before the audience after the fitting time for the descending of our drama's curtain. Impressed with this conviction; we bid adieu to all our fellow-voyageurs, referring them to the following editorial article from the Court Journal for the particulars of a denouement, which it is presumed they have generally anticipated. From the Court Journal of—, 18— “MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE. “On Monday last Jerningham House, the beautiful and romantic seat of Lord Templeton, was honoured by the presence of a most brilliant assemblage of rank, beauty and fashion, on the occasion of the union of his lordship's eldest daughter, the Hon. Miss Jerningham, with his Excellency Lucius Courtenay, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States of America, near the Court of St. James', and also that of Sydney Clifton Borrowdale, Esquire, of New-York, America, to Julia, adopted daughter of James Borrowdale, Esquire, of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts. “The interest attached to the performance of this important ceremony was greatly heightened on the present occasion by the romantic nature of the younger Mr. Borrowdale's history; who, stolen from his parents in childhood, was placed in charge of a wretched couple named Glenthorne, who both closed a life of crime by suicide. The facts connected with his supposed parentage have attained notoreity by their partial disclosure at a recent trial for highway robbery; but it is not generally known that the young gentleman is a near relative of the noble lord whom he gallantly rescued from the clutches of the robbers, and will, at the demise of his father, stand next in succession to the title and estates. “From his first advent in this world of trouble, Mr. Borrowdale appears to have been the sport of malign influences, which, until quite recently, have reigned with despotic sway over his fortunes and reputation. To the schemes of one De Lyle is attributed the greater portion of his late calamities, who, our readers will recollect, was murdered a few days since by one whom he had deeply injured. In addition to all these circumstances, the authorship of “Fatality” and “The Conscience Stricken,” is avowed by this accomplished American, who will rival the most celebrated authors of our time, if a fortune and the possession of the young lady to whom he is passionately attached, do not clip the eagle wings of his ambition, and cause him to abandon a career in which he is so well fitted to shine. “Among the guests were several distinguished Americans, of whom Baillie Shafton, Julius Ellingbourne and Pierce Matthison, Esquires, were conspicuous. The first named gentleman is a great favourite in our fashionable circles, where on a previous visit to the metropolis his sallies of wit, and courteous manners rendered him a welcome guest at every mansion. “Mr. Ellingbourne was the antagonist of the younger Mr. Borrowdale, in an affair of honour, previous to his leaving New-York, the result of which was nearly fatal to the former. Mutual explanations have removed all cause of hostility, and, like men of honour, they are again friends. Mr. Matthison is somewhat celebrated, considering his recent arrival among us, for the promulgation of a novel theory relating to the mutual operation of mind and matter, and although we do not profess to have become converts to the gentleman's doctrines, we cheerfully admit the originality and plausibility with which they are presented. “It would perhaps be invidious to select any lady from the brilliant throng as peculiarly entitled to admiration, but we may well be pardoned for noticing the majestic figure and graceful bearing of Miss Helen Elwell, a young American lady—and the cousin of Mr. Borrowdale's charming bride—who was the cynosure of all eyes. “A whisper circulated through the crowd, alledging her early attachment to the young American who has wedded her cousin, excited the curious attention of many guests; but if “grief, like a worm in the bud,” preyed on her heart, its effect on her person was not discernible; unless a lofty appearance of indifference to the ceremonies of the bridal, might be deemed the result of studied effort, rather than the natural effects of constitutional coldness. “Since the celebration of these nuptials, we learn that Julius Ellingbourne, Esq., has led this young lady to the hymeneal altar, and we trust that no regrets for unattainable enjoyments will poison the happiness of either party. “We are informed that it is the intention of Lord Templeton and his beautiful unmarried daughter, the Hon. Miss Euphenia Jerningham, to visit an estate in the north of England, in company with the new-married couples. “As a sequel to the notice of Mr. Borrowdale, jun.'s history, it may be well to state that to a worthy gentleman of New-York and his lady was he indebted for the name of Clifton, who, although in moderate circumstances, gave their adopted son an education which his genius and application have nobly improved. For this excellent couple their charge entertains the most affectionate regard; and from respect for those to whom his future heir is so deeply indebted, Lord Templeton has transferred them the title deeds of a valuable estate in the county of Northumberland, and in the event of their declining its occupancy the income will be remitted them annually. “By late arrivals from New-York, it appears that an individual named Thomas Burchard, who was the instrument and pander of De Lyle, in his base assaults upon the character of Mr. Borrowdale, has at length atoned for his crimes, by being recently sentenced to the State's prison for life. The immediate cause of his arrest was the commission of a daring burglary; and the developments on his trial were so fatal to his cause, that the bench of judges unanimously concurred in awarding the severest punishment which the law would permit. The eminent mercantile house of Howard, De Lyle &amp; Co., of New-York, have suspended payment. This unlooked-for event created the most intense excitement in commercial circles, when it was understood that the large engagements which caused their bankruptcy were entered into surreptitiously by the younger De Lyle, without the knowledge of his partners; and that the endorsements were, in many instances, forgeries. That the senior partner of the firm, the father of the wretched individual whose career was recently closed in this city, will, on learning the fate of his only child, be prostrated, never to rise, is but too probable; and we unite with his business friends here, in deploring a calamity which will embitter the remaining days of a high-minded and virtuous gentleman. “A recurrence by Messrs. Courtenay and Clifton to early reminiscences disclosed an intimacy which existed between them in boyhood of which both were previously unaware. “In consequence of Mr. Courtenay having inherited a large fortune, on condition of assuming the name of the legatee, the gentlemen met in London as strangers. “The name of the American minister was originally Henry Melbourne, and it is stated that his father was a distinguished American officer.”</field>
