      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. THE CONSULTATION. “My dear,” said Mrs. Harley to her husband one morning, “I have been thinking we had better make a change in our domestic department. Nancy, I find, is getting quite impertinent; she wants to go out one afternoon every week, and that, in addition to her nightly meetings, is quite too much. Shall I settle with her to-day and dismiss her?” “Why, wife,” said Mr. Harley, “you really astonish me. This changing of help is enough to make one wearied of living. Nancy is a very good girl, for aught I can see. I am sure she is an excellent cook, and you had better take into the account how much you would miss her in arranging your supper-table now and then, and her economical habits in the use of every article, not excepting wood, wherein she has saved full half her wages the present winter.” “Oh, husband, you know nothing about her. To be sure, she is careful about some things, and methodical and neat, I will allow; but she wants too many privileges. There must be a fortnight every year set apart for visiting her mother, and that hateful aunt, that plagued us so last summer with `coming down' to do her shopping, as she called it. Besides, there is Friday evening for the lecture, and she is not always as pleasant as you take her to be when you are out of the house. I only wish you had to manage one week in-doors. I suspect making out invoices and examining bales of merchandise would be easy work compared with it. But tell me, had I not better dismiss Nancy before we give our party? There is a fine housekeeper who is about leaving Mrs. Hunt, whom I could obtain for two dollars a week, and with her I could get rid of overseeing forever from morning till night. However, I submit it to you whether she shall go or not; I want to words as an afterpiece. Say all now, just as you think.” “As you ask my advice, my dear, I will give it you; but you know, beforehand, you will act as you please, notwithstanding. I make it a rule with myself, when I obtain a clerk who is honest and faithful, to overlook the many disagreeables by steadily fixing my eye upon the predominating good qualities, and to retain him in my service. As there are no faultless beings among the employers nor the employed, I account it a good thing to be forbearing—to overlook what we cannot avoid; and when we do reprove, let it be done mildly, yet firmly. I should try this course with Nancy, and if she is really incorrigible and impudent, I should dismiss her; if not, by all means keep her; for our frequent changes of help may lead people to call us very particular persons, to say the least. As I have already remarked, you can talk with Nancy, and if you find her desirous of staying, I would show a disposition to retain her, for where there is one better you would find many worse, as we have had frequent experience.” “I don't know about that, Mr. Harley. Susan Miles was a great deal pleasanter tempered, and kinder to little John. Ellen Sawyer was very good, although she was slack; and there are things I do not like in Nancy; and as I have all, comparatively, to do with her, I must say I am the better judge about her good or bad qualities.” “Well, wife, I see, after all, you mean to have your own way. My place is in the store, yours in the house; and I leave you to manage. I will bring home some small notes at dinner-time, and if Nancy has her dismission, she can be paid and go, I suppose.” Mr. Harley made his way to the store, thankful, as we may infer, that he had one retreat where the din of fault-finding was not heard. As Nancy came up to take the breakfast dishes, Mrs. Harley began to interrogate her. “I find, Nancy, of late, you require many privileges. I have just been talking with husband, and he thinks if we can keep together, we had better; if not, we will separate. You know your wages are high, and my demands upon your time are proportionately so; if, therefore, you can give up your weekly afternoon visit and your visit yearly, and be content to take care of little Johnny and do the work when I am out, always laying the table with one extra plate—provided husband brings somebody home to dine—and do the other duties about the house cheerfully and willingly, why, you can stay with me; if not, I know a most perfect housekeeper, whose services I can obtain, and whose wages will be but a trifle higher than yours; and with her I can have all these requirements, besides many other excellent things, such as my common sewing done, little John's clothes cut, and Mr. Harley's shirts made. This person does all such things, Nancy, and you know these alone would be a great saving to my time.” Nancy stammered; she had not known but that she gave satisfaction to her mistress; she had endeavoured to do her duty, make herself obliging, and earn her wages. This sudden attack, therefore, almost overpowered her; still, she commanded a little independence, and made out to say, “If my services do not suit you, Mrs. Harley, I will not stand in the way of your getting better help; but if you require me to give up my lecture and my visit to my aged mother, I must tell you I cannot do these things, because I look upon them as duties, and most ladies would consider them as such.” “Then it is of no use for us to try to keep together,” said Mrs. Harley, quite piqued at Nancy's last remark. “I will pay you this afternoon, and you may look elsewhere for a place. In the mean time, I will go out and secure the woman I spoke of. I dare say she will answer my purpose better.” Thus was a faithful domestic “turned off,” in the vain hope that a better could be obtained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B CHAPTER II. HIRING A HOUSEKEEPER. The door-bell rang at Mrs. Hunt's, and Mrs. Harley was announced as wishing to speak with Mrs. Hopkins the housekeeper. Presently a tall, rather genteelly-attired middle-aged female entered. Her face was not altogether prepossessing, for she had a terrible squint and an occasional scowl; besides, she wore a large mourning-ring on her forefinger, and seemed very much at home in the parlour. But Mrs. Harley called on business, and etiquette required no preface with a housekeeper. “I hear,” said Mrs. Harley, “that you are about leaving Mrs. Hunt, and she has recommended me to secure your services, if possible; she gives you an excellent character for faithfulness, honesty, and capability. Now as I have had those in my employ entirely destitute of all these last qualities, I am desirous of procuring you without delay to superintend my family. The work is light, the house very convenient and pleasant; we have but little company, live very plain, and a good, systematic housekeeper would have full half the time to herself. In such a place, what wages would you expect, Mrs. Hopkins?” “I suppose you have a girl `to wait and tend,' and a man to make the fires?” said the experienced housekeeper. “Oh no,” said Mrs. Harley; “my husband would not have so many people about. A man I detest myself. They are in the way in small families more than their services are worth. I make it a point to do nearly all for my little boy myself. Mr. Harley does his own waiting, and we have never kept but one girl.” “Then,” said the housekeeper, “I should not like to engage. I have the offer of three good places now. Mrs. Ogle sent for me yesterday: she keeps a man, two girls, and a washerwoman, and has only three in the family. She offers me every privilege and three dollars a week for my services. Mrs. Perkins does the same; and in either of those places my work would only consist of a simple oversight of the establishment. Besides, they travel during the summer, and the houses are both kept open, and I can have access to everything—” Here the delightful conversation was ended by a violent coughing-fit which seized Mrs. Hopkins, and terminated a recital of her high expectations. Now was the time for Mrs. Harley to improve or lose the opportunity of securing the treasure of an experienced housekeeper. She saw that she was reduced to the necessity of getting two instead of one to supply faithful Nancy's place, and it might be that even three would not do it! It occurred to her, very luckily, that she could obtain a child for her “victuals and clothes” (as the homely phrase is), who would answer “to wait and tend;” and as these were expenses she should not feel, it seemed practicable to engage Mrs. Hopkins. The wages were enormous. “Nancy did all for ten and sixpence,” echoed in her ears; and fearing a re-echo from Mr. Harley, she demurred about the wages, and finally it was agreed that the house should be kept by Mrs. Hopkins for the sum of two dollars and a half per week, provided extra help should be furnished, and yet other assistance on washing days, party nights, &amp;c. Mrs. Hopkins was to be installed in her new home the next week. Mrs. Harley returned home, and finding herself rather premature in her dismissal of Nancy, overcame her natural dislike of yielding, and begged her to stay till the aforesaid housekeeper should enter upon her duties, it being conceded that it might be a mutual accommodation. It was now dinner-time. Mr. Harley came home with rather a lengthened visage; perhaps some little incident in a business transaction had ruffled his temper; perhaps he dreaded continual changes at home! At any rate, it was an unguarded moment to consult with him respecting such a movement. Married ladies should never consult their husbands upon important changes when their spirits are disturbed by vexatious out-door proceedings. Mrs. Harley had not learned this. She accordingly gave a spring with little John, whom she held in her arms in the nursery, as she heard the door open, and, seating herself in the dining-room, she began: “Oh, husband, I have talked with Nancy, and she says she cannot give up her lectures and her visits, &amp;c. B 2 The long and short of the story is, that she is going away—not this afternoon, so don't scowl so; but when Mrs. Hopkins comes, and that will be next Friday—one week hence; and after dinner I want you to go with me to the society where they keep poor children `to let or give away,' if people want them, and we will select a little girl, one that can take care of little Johnny, and do a great deal of light work, for Mrs. Hopkins has not been accustomed to that. She has had the offer of ever so many places where they keep men, and women, and children, and she could get high wages just for an oversight in such places, so I know she is a first-rate housekeeper; and I thought we had better begin with her indulgently; and I promised to get a girl to assist, which, you know, will really be a great service to us.” “And what wages,” inquired Mr. Harley, “does the new housekeeper require? As she is to assume the character of mistress,” he said, rather sarcastically, “I suppose she expects high remuneration?” “Only two dollars and a half a week, husband! Do you think that high, considering how much sewing she is to do? Besides, she will prepare nearly all for our party; she is excellent at blanc-mange, custards, and ices; she dresses ham beautifully, can make as good chicken-salad as Ude himself, and scallops oysters to a nicety. Now, considering all these things, is it not better to pay a little more, and have one person do all?” “These are all expectations, Mary; perhaps the reality will prove that she is not as good as Nancy, after all. I have seen people highly recommended who proved no better on that account; and I must say, I think we shall go on rather extravagantly.” A fortune in a wife, and a fortune with a wife, are not synonymous terms, thought Mr. Harley. There are men in the world who are willing to yield to their wives a carte blanche as to expenses and in-door management for a time, to show them their own incompetency for the charge, even though they be sufferers thereby: such a one was Mr. Harley. They accordingly went to the society before mentioned, and made choice of a girl, who was to do the housekeeper's bidding at the very cheapest rate, and hurried back to afford Nancy an opportunity to go out in pursuit of a place. It so happened that a cook was wanted in one of our opulent families, and advertisements had been inserted in the newspapers to obtain one. Nancy had read them, and, neatly attired, she made her way thither. Her modest face was a passport to her reception, and an agreement was immediately made, provided she could enter upon her labours the next Monday morning. “Mrs. Harley will not refuse this privilege,” thought Nancy; “and as my dismission is sudden, she will not deprive me of a good place to befriend her a few days.” Justice to Mr. and Mrs. Harley require me to add that she predicted rightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. MRS. HARLEY AND HER TRIALS. We will leave Nancy at her new abode, and look in upon Mrs. Harley on Monday afternoon. The reader has had no history of her early life. Suffice it to say that she was very beautiful, and brought up by an indulgent mother, who had a few thousands, the income of which, with a part of the principal, she had lavished upon her daughter's education. She painted in water colours, and played upon the piano; she could imitate a mezzotint engraving exceedingly well, and make a wax japonica far more superb than a real one; she could waltz as well as a French dancing-master, and it was more currently reported than believed that she once took lessons on the harp. Be that as it may, her “harp of a thousand strings” was seldom long in tune at a time. She grew up fond of excitement—the creature of impulse—living upon an expected ball or party; and so exquisitely sensitive, that plain household affairs could not be discussed in her presence. Her mother, it was said, predicted from her birth that she would rise “to great wealth and preferment,” because the dream-book solemnly asserted that a child born in that month, and on that day of the month, would meet with such a fate! But, as a proof that we often grievously deceive ourselves, the result was, that she married a young gentleman of good standing in society, to be sure, and of respectable wealth, but not enough to shine as a rich man. At the time of Nancy's departure they had been married three years, had been keeping house about two years, and, incredible as it may appear, in that time they had employed and discarded thirteen different domestics! The reader will pardon this digression, as the sketch seemed necessary to prepare us for taking a peep at the domestic arrangements as they came along under the superintendence of Mrs. Harley. Nancy left everything in extremely neat order, and it required but little experience to keep things smoothly for a few days at least. But, for the want of that little experience, what difficulties ensue! Mrs. Harley's first effort at making tea gave proof of her utter incompetency. She omitted to kindle the fire in due season, and, of course, it was very late before supper appeared. Thought she, “Anybody can make a good toast; it is easy to do, and will be acceptable to Mr. Harley.” So she proceeded to the simple process of cutting the bread: she had seen that done times without number: there could be no art in that! Eight or ten slices were soon cut about the thickness of a wafer; the fire was scorching hot, and the bread, being left to take care of itself while she laid the table, was sadly burned; but, by dint of scraping and cutting, it assumed only a dark brown appearance, dried to a crisp! In this condition, she deemed rightly a little melted butter would soften it; but as she unluckily forgot to add a little water and salt with it, it made but a poor accompaniment to a cup of tea, which tasted very much as if it were made of smoky water, in consequence of having forgotten the cover to the teakettle! But, as simple as was this first trial of her skill, it produced a great deal of heat and an unusual excitability of temper. She was heard to exclaim something about the trials of house-keepers, and to intimate a wish that she were once more at board. But Tuesday morning quickly came, and how should she manage to get a breakfast? had occurred to her during a wakeful hour of the night. She resolved that her husband should not laugh at her inefficiency; and as he had procured all the requisites for a good fire the night before, and had actually risen and made it, lest the lid of the teakettle should be again forgotten, she proceeded, in like manner as the evening before, to try her skill at another plate of toast. Mr. Harley kindly volunteered to cut the bread; and as the making of coffee would be attended with trouble, they united in the belief that cocoa made on the table would answer the purpose just as well. But Johnny has awaked, and is crying to be dressed! It was a forlorn condition to be thus harassed, and no wonder Mrs. Harley cast about to know what she could do. It is fortunate for one at such a time if they have an obliging husband. Mr. Harley volunteered the office of nurse and dressing-maid to the child, and by dint of much running and flurrying a breakfast was procured, but of how fine a flavour neither of the parties was heard to speak. As Mr. Harley was about leaving the house for his business, having concluded that a steak would serve all purposes for a dinner, the utter impossibility of undertaking such a charge overwhelmed the sensitive wife entirely. She burst into tears, and could only articulate, “Hus—band, will you—pro—procure me some—help?” The request was irresistible, and Mr. Harley proceeded forthwith to the society where the little girl resided, and by many entreaties succeeded in getting her to attend him home immediately. His wife, hearing the door open, flew to his presence, and, delighted with the idea that help was so quickly obtained, really resumed her accustomed cheerfulness, and felt that the interval between this and Friday, when the housekeeper would arrive, was not so very long, after all. She took the little stranger to the nursery, and bade her amuse Johnny till it was time to superintend the dinner. But did the reader ever take charge of a little girl who had scarcely learned the names of things, C much less their uses? If so, her expectations will not be very exalted of immediate aid from this source. It requires a good manager to train such a child to be useful. “You may go, Dorcas,” said Mrs. Harley, as the clock struck one, “and put the potatoes to boil.” She forgot that the fire had gone out, and that the child did not know where to find the potatoes, nor how to boil them if they were at hand. Poor Dorcas went down stairs, stood in the kitchen, put her fingers in her mouth, and looked out in the street to see how well the boys coasted down the hill back of the windows! There was a dead silence. Mrs. Harley went to the kitchen door in due time, and inquired if “she was going on well?” Dorcas, not daring to say to the contrary, breathed out a low “Yes, ma'am.” “Then you may come and lay the table now,” said her mistress. The child came, purple with staying in the cold kitchen, clothed as she was in her light summer garments, all the worse for wear, and awkwardly attempted to proceed as Mrs. Harley awkwardly dictated. A few moments before two o'clock, Mrs. Harley inquired of Dorcas if the potatoes were nearly done. Again she stammered “Yes, ma'am.” “Then you may begin to cook your steak now,” said Mrs. Harley. The child was ordered to her cold kitchen, and there was a dead calm. It was dinner-time. Mr. Harley came home, and Dorcas was told to bring up dinner. While they were waiting for its arrival, Mrs. Harley was expatiating on Dorcas's good qualities. “Why,” said she, “I shouldn't wonder if in time we made out to do very well alone with her. The child does not seem half as awkward as I expected; these societies, after all, have a very good influence on poor children; they make them obedient and kind, and really I think that we shall never regret having taken one from its secluded walls. Do just come in the nursery, husband; I want to show you some flowers I have been arranging to wear in my hair to-night at Mrs. Blake's, while Johnny was asleep and Dorcas getting dinner.” “I am in such haste, my dear, I cannot look at them now. Let's have dinner: I engaged to meet a man on business at three this afternoon,” said Mr. Harley. “Dorcas, bring up dinner!” vociferated Mrs. Harley, at the top of the stairs. No dinner came, and Mr. Harley, not his wife, ran down to see the cause of the delay. What was his consternation at finding little Dorcas curled up in a chair, alternately looking at the pictures in an old almanac, and the boys as they coasted down the hill. Not a spark glimmered on the hearth. The breakfast relics were scattered on the table, while the potatoes were still ensconced in the barrel, and the steak in the closet! “Well, wife,” said Mr. Harley, “we are in a fine predicament, I must confess.” “What has happened to put you in such a fluster?” said the astonished wife. “Your eyes glisten like a maniac's!” While attempting thus to divine the cause, as she was disposing a bit of blonde lace over some flowers, Mr. Harley took his hat and left the house. Alarmed at such an unusual proceeding, she threw down the lace and made her way to the kitchen. Ungovernable tempers often vent themselves in harsh expressions; we will not disgrace Mrs. Harley by repeating hers; suffice it to say, poor Dorcas fell faster than a thermometer, by a sudden change from heat to cold, in Mrs. Harley's estimation. Instead of a comfort, she had a torment. She could not endure it: anger, sorrow, and self-reproach found vent in tears, and in the depths of despair to bring about a better state of things, she resolved to dress herself and go to Mrs. Hunt's, and if money and persuasion could prevail, to use both lavishly to procure the immediate services of the housekeeper. “It is high time,” thought she, “to conciliate my husband's esteem.” Intent on this scheme, Dorcas was left with John, feeling that her new home was not as pleasant as the one she had left: a scanty meal was provided for her there; now she had none, because she could not provide for others. The “experienced housekeeper,” as luck would have it, had gone on a visit to her daughter in a neighbouring town; but Mrs. Hunt, kindly disposed towards her suffering friend, offered her the help of her chamber-maid, whom she was about sending away that very afternoon, adding, by way of recommendation, that “poor help is better than none.” Mrs. Harley, having a vivid recollection of Dorcas, C 2 could not coincide with the remark, but supposing age was synonymous with usefulness in a domestic, concluded Bridget would do for a few days. Now Bridget was a stout Irish woman, who counted her beads, made confession of her sins (which were many), and attended mass regularly, and all the wakes to which she was invited. About five that afternoon she entered upon service in Mrs. Harley's employ, who did not see her till she appeared in person at her door, to which she had been directed with extreme accuracy, lest she might go to the wrong place, as she had done once before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE IRISH COOK. “And what does your ladyship require of me?” asked Bridget, as she courtesied before her mistress. “It sure is not all the work you are about setting me to do, for it is not me who am accustomed to all sorts of labour.” “I suppose you can do plain cooking?” asked Mrs. Harley; “at least you must try your hand at it a few days, until my housekeeper arrives?” “And may I ask your ladyship who she is to be?” “Why, Mrs. Hopkins, Bridget; she with whom you have been living. I thought Mrs. Hunt told you.” “Indade not,” said Bridget, colouring deeply; “if it's her who is to be my mistress, I will be after walking full shortly. Since I came to Ameriky I have never seen her like, and, by the powers, I have lived in all sorts of families; howsomdever, it's not looking well in me to put her out of your ladyship's favour afore she comes, so plase tell me my business, and I will be looking after it at once.” Mrs. Harley's heart sank within her as she listened to the innuendoes with which Bridget abounded about Mrs. Hopkins; but, willing to look on the favourable side, she reasoned with herself in this manner: “The Irish have strong dislikes, and express them unguardedly; it may be some trifling offence is the origin of all this hatred;” and with a sincere desire that things should be better arranged for tea than they had been at dinner, she bade Bridget make some buttermilk cakes for supper, as she had always heard that the Irish were particularly fond of making that kind of bread, in remembrance of the fare of their native country. She even went so far out of her usual routine as to show her new girl where she could find all the ingredients, and most neatly arranged was everything by the faithful Nancy before she left. The contrast between this unpromising cook and her last really made Mrs. Harley sigh; so she left the kitchen, bidding Bridget be sure and have tea ready at seven. Having satisfied herself that here her duty ended, she dismissed all anxiety as to the result, and returned to the nursery to await her husband's return. He came, wearing an anxious brow, giving outward evidences of the conflict within. How often had he regretted that he had been fascinated by accomplishments merely; and thus sorrow, mingling with his love, that one so misdirected in youth should be the hinderance rather than the helper of his joys, made his heart ache, and he sought to drown his bitter thoughts in forgetfulness by mingling with the world, sometimes in the theatre, and sometimes with a jovial club. His wife, among her frivolities, looked not beyond the present moment, and, provided both were pleased, it mattered not how the pleasure was procured. But we will not digress any longer from the tea-table. “The biscuit is done, ma'am, and the tea is waiting for his honour,” was the summons to the evening meal. And, sure enough, there were plenty of them done, for in the centre of the table was a high mound of bread sufficient for a large company; two slices of butter were ranged on each side of it, and, not finding the milk handy, she had put on some buttermilk, while, fearing lest the tea should be wanting in strength, she had filled the teapot nearly half full before she poured the water upon it. Mr. and Mrs. Harley diluted it again and again: still its fearful strength remained. The whole solution of the affair was, that Bridget, having tasted something stronger than the tea, mistook the proper quantity, and having carried it to table, had laid herself before the kitchen fire to cure her toothache. “She had rinsed her mouth with a little New-England rum, and it produced a sleepy sensation!” The pain continued so violently that she could not rise, and finally was obliged to be helped or carried to bed; and as she had made cakes enough for breakfast, she concluded her time was her own, and she could use it as she pleased. Having put her in safe quarters for the night, Mr. Harley proposed to his wife that they should go in the kitchen and look after the new cook's arrangements for the next day. There was a pan of bread standing uncovered upon the hearth, mixed neither with buttermilk, yeast, nor water. Its appearance was dingy in the extreme, and its flavour evinced that coffee or the grounds of coffee were not wanting to give it consistency. What treatise of cookery Bridget had studied, no one could tell. Upon being interrogated the next morning, she said it was done by “confusion of her brain.” Fearing lest the complaint should again seize her, the jug of New-England rum was carefully locked up, and Bridget was herself again. Still, it must be acknowledged that she was poorly versed in cookery; for, upon receiving a piece of meat slightly corned to be boiled for dinner, Bridget very carefully spitted the same, and, after much basting and “labouring over the joint,” as she called it, “it would not look rigelar like roast mate at all.” All these inconveniences were pretty quietly borne, because hope whispered in Mrs. Harley's ear that the housekeeper would remedy all defects; and she so often told her husband this, that he too tried to persuade himself of its truth. But there will be times when strong realities render even hope faint, and such were the days which were pressing upon the married pair. “Patience had its perfect work” wherever Bridget lived, and she called it in full exercise again the day after she roasted the corned meat. For a day or two past, Bridget, finding that she was not very narrowly watched by her good mistress, and overhearing her say that she intended to go out on a certain evening, thought within herself there would be no harm in giving “a bit of a spree.” She saw there would be a difficulty in giving her invitations verbally; but, being fortunately acquainted with the men who took the “dry dirt” and the scavenger, she communicated her intention of having a party to them, and delegated them to give her invitations, adding, “Be sure and tell them not to come till early bedtime, lest my master and mistress be not out of the way.” The sons of the Green Isle tipped up the barrel and firkin with a significant nod to Bridget, and the invitations were forthwith despatched. Bridget blundered over her duties very unsatisfactorily to her master and mistress, always failing whenever a good thing was expected of her, and yet continuing to lead a tolerably sober life, because, as she had free access to the store-room, she knew the benefit it would confer on her at her approaching party. She most good-humouredly assisted her mistress when the eventful evening came, and having lavished many encomiums upon her, as soon as they were gone prepared herself to receive her guests. Little Johnny was left asleep, quite unconscious of what was going on below. Dorcas had nodded until her knitting-work had dropped upon the floor, and then betook herself to rest, leaving Bridget sole mistress, momentarily expecting her friends. A loud shuffling of feet and clamour of tongues announced the approach of Patrick O'Connelly and his intended mate, Lucinda Finahan. Bridget had scarcely finished her demonstrations of joy, heightened, “because they had come just in time,” when a loud knock announced the remainder of the party. They were quickly seated in the dining-room, and in true Irish style having expressed themselves very hyperbolically upon the beauty of the apartment, it was proposed that they should take a game at cards. But this being a rather quiet business, since Bridget had found the key to the wine-cellar, a dance was preferred. But they had no music; and as the piano was silent in the parlour, there could be no harm D in just touching the keys: they could make out to hop by the sound. The “crathur” they had swallowed rather lavishly made them exceedingly boisterous and merry. In the midst of this high excitement, who should open the door but Mr. Harley. Bridget's heart leaped to her mouth, and she attempted to stammer out an apology, but it was too late: she was near losing her balance, and retreated to bed, leaving her company to manage for themselves in the best way they could. They were quickly escorted to the door by Mr. Harley, he bidding them, upon peril of life and limb, never to venture into his house again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. AN EVENING LECTURE AND A MORNING SCENE. If there ever was reason to give what is called a “curtain lecture,” surely the propitious time had now arrived. True, Mrs. Harley had nearly fainted with agitation at Bridget's unlawful proceedings, but she imagined that she could not be chargeable with the fault: the Irish were so disposed to take liberties, no restraint was of any use to them. Not so reasoned the incensed husband: it appeared to him that utter ruin was awaiting him—loss of reputation, at being thus imposed upon by help; and loss of comfort, since his home afforded none of it. He expressed himself firmly and freely. “Wife, things have come to such a pass that I must interfere; hitherto I have given you the charge of the house, thinking the office of managing belonged to the woman. I have not requested or wished you to labour, but I have expected an oversight of the domestic arrangements, which you have not bestowed. I have become weary of living; all I provide is worse than lost. Our family is small enough to be easily and prudently managed, but how is it done? The single article of flour has cost me more than my neighbours, who have twice the number of persons; and my bill at the grocer's this year, which only includes small items, amounts to more than three hundred dollars. I must turn the tables, and see what I can do.” “My dear,” articulated the grieved wife, “when the housekeeper comes it will not be so. She will be here to-morrow night.” “I am not at all certain she will remedy the case, wife. Every married woman in good health should keep her own house: it is a sacred office, from which she has no right to shrink; it is a part of her marriage covenant —it gives dignity to her character.” “And littleness to her mind,” interrupted Mrs. Harley. “So long, my dear, as you cherish such a silly impression, I can predict nothing but evil. I will submit it to yourself, which is the most elevating employment, to spend one's time and ingenuity in decorating a dress for a ball, arranging a few flowers for the hair, and ransacking every dry goods store for the particular shade of a riband, or faithfully to superintend that domestic economy which gives pleasure to the kind husband, and by regularity and becoming dignity creates the fear of doing wrong in the servants? I must say, had you discharged these duties, I do not believe we should have been assailed by an Irish mob; and farther yet, had you known the worth of a good domestic, Nancy would not have been turned away because her principles made it important she should go out one evening in the week to a religious lecture: we were never disgraced by drunken revels when she was with us.” “You are forever recounting the good qualities of Nancy,” said the irritated wife: “I intend, if my life is spared me till to-morrow, to get her back, if I can. I will give up my housekeeper, who possesses every requisite for the office, and once more see if, by giving Nancy all her privileges, I can have a little peace, for between you and the help I have lived in misery ever since I commenced keeping house.” D 2 “That you cannot do,” said Mr. Harley, “for I saw the gentleman with whom Nancy now lives yesterday, and he says she is worth everything to him—she is so quiet and methodical.” “And stupid and overbearing he might have added,” said Mrs. Harley. “No, I won't go after her either; for if I send Bridget away and Mrs. Hopkins comes, she will oversee Dorcas, and we shall do very well yet: you may say what you please, husband, I am resolved to try a housekeeper. You know nothing about my cares. Is not Johnny enough for one woman to take care of? and besides, what time could I get to sew, or read, or prepare for company, or receive any, if I made myself the slave you wish? If I have a housekeeper, she will take charge of all these things, and my mind need not be disturbed with `what will we have for dinner?' and `will you see to the pudding yourself, my dear, and have it punctually served?' No, thank fortune, you can discuss such matters with the housekeeper, and I shall be permitted to superintend my dressmaker, which is far more congenial to my mind.” “And elevating to your character, I suppose,” said Mr. Harley, rather sarcastically. “You are too provoking,” answered the indignant wife: “I wish to hear no more, for I am sleepy.” So saying, she betook herself seemingly to rest. What were the nature of her dreams, I will not pretend to say. Not so with Mr. Harley. He was tried beyond measure; mortification, anxiety, bitter reflections, and dissatisfaction with his manner of living, banished completely sweet forgetfulness. He would fain live rationally; with prudence, his gains would warrant many luxuries: still, though every avenue seemed closed that would bring about his purposes, he tried to think his wife's prediction might be verified, and that the housekeeper would restore some degree of comfort to his dwelling. Thus he passed a wretched night. Towards morning the intoxicated Bridget was heard making her way to the kitchen; but having risen in the night and partaken of the liquor, she was illy qualified to procure a comfortable breakfast. Her eyes were so dimmed that she hardly knew a frving-pan from a coffee-pot! She mistook the uses of things, till, growing more and more bewildered, she seized hold of the table lest she should fall, and upset it, demolishing much of the useful crockery, besides cutting her head with some of the pieces. Mr. Harley started from his bed and made for the kitchen in good earnest; seeing the dreadful havoc occasioned by the use of the jug which was standing on the mantel shelf (Bridget having obtained one of her own), he proceeded to the street, and engaged a man to convey the senseless domestic to the police court as soon as it opened. Here she, being recognised as an old offender, was conveyed, as usual, to the House of Correction for six months. Mrs. Harley awoke, and freshly pondering upon last night's lecture, resolved to acquit herself rather better as a good manager, and accordingly proceeded to the kitchen, where her eyes told her the scene that had occurred. The place was truly disgusting. Who would not rather exert themselves, if need require, than to intrust the care of the household establishment to hands so inefficient and irresponsible! And now there came another eventful day. Dorcas and her mistress were once more alone, and they both determined to do as well as they could, cost them what labour it might. Accordingly, they went about the difficult process of preparing dinner. Once more they attempted to broil a steak and boil some rice—two very simple things, certainly. With the steak they were tolerably successful, but with the rice! Dorcas was untidy in the extreme, and, without any preparation, she threw the rice in a dingy pot: it burned upon the sides; and once more Mrs. Harley was lowered in her husband's eyes because she despised cooking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE HOUSEKEEPER. We are now to be ushered into the presence of Mrs. Hopkins, the notable housekeeper, who is to take charge of everything, to bring “order out of confusion,” and restore quietness where discord has reigned. She has just alighted from a carriage, bringing with her a large travelling trunk and valise, besides sundry bandboxes, all of which indicated to the vigilant eyes of the neighbours that Mrs. Harley had a country cousin who had dropped down in an evil time, as they were aware of her inadequacy to take charge of those already under her care. Mrs. Hopkins's appearance was masculine in the extreme; she looked competent to navigate a ship, to say nothing of managing a house. After considerable stir made by paying for her conveyance, which the coachman thought worth fifty cents, and Mrs. Hopkins but twenty-five, she closed the door with a loud invective against all hackmen, and, escorted by Dorcas, went to the nursery, where she found Mrs. Harley busily engaged in taking care of little Johnny, who was threatened with the croup. “I am so glad you have come, Mrs. Hopkins,” said the delighted Mrs. Harley, “that I know not how to express myself. Had it not been for the expectation of seeing you, I should hardly have survived the day. Now I want you to make this your home, to act in it as if it were your own.” To all this the housekeeper assented with becoming nods. There was one thing Mrs. Harley detected which damped the ardour of her expectations: she observed that Mrs. Hopkins sat in gloves: it might be, she had chapped hands; but they were pic-nic gloves. Had that been the case, she would have worn kid. And still she sat, not asking to see the kitchen, nor offering to do anything in the nursery. At length it was nearly tea-time. Mrs. Harley revolved in her mind what she should say. How unfortunate that she could not assert her place, and thus show the housekeeper hers likewise. Dorcas had been despatched to kindle a fire under the tea-kettle; meanwhile Mrs. Hopkins took out her knitting, drew off her gloves, and behold, there were glittering rings on her fingers! But the time had come for Mrs. Harley to speak: she mustered courage and said, “Mrs. Hopkins, will you take charge of the tea-table to-night?” “Certainly,” replied the dame: “I always preside at the tea-table.” “But I mean, see to the making of the toast, and putting in a proper quantity of tea. Dorcas is at your service to assist you.” “That is not my business, Mrs. Harley. I did not understand, when I engaged to become your housekeeper, that I should be your cook. I merely engaged to see to the arrangements of your table, give directions as to the quality and quantity of the food, and the time that was unoccupied after this oversight was completed was to be my own. You surely have a cook in your kitchen?” Mrs. Harley had a certain inefficiency of mind, which caused her to be grossly imposed upon by the artful—such a woman as she had now to contend with in Mrs. Hopkins. She therefore did not instantly inform her how she understood it, and tell the real state of the case, but gave a sort of passive assent to all that was said, which imboldened greatly the new housekeeper. “Bridget, my cook, left me this morning,” said Mrs. Harley. Mrs. Hopkins burst into a violent fit of laughter at the idea of Bridget's being a cook, as she had been an eye-witness to her capability while in Mrs. Hunt's employ. “But I nope you are on the look-out for another,” said Mrs. Hopkins; and, bridling up her head, she added, “I could have gone to fifty places where they have established servants, had it not been for your pressing solicitations.” Now the whole truth was laid open: a new cook was to be provided. Mistress Hopkins's place was in the parlour, Dorcas was to do as she dictated, and Mrs. Harley was indeed to relinquish housekeeping. She dared not think of the issue. What would Mr. Harley say? He had already said, “Every woman ought to manage her own house.” She had a sort of feeling that there was truth in the remark. During this course of reasoning, however, all things stood still. Dorcas had made the water boil in the tea-kettle, and then, like a E child, had recourse to her almanac, and felt no farther concern. Mr. Harley came home to supper: the housekeeper was busily engaged in knitting. Mrs. Harley looked disconcerted, for, in fact, there was not much to give her a calm expression. She called Dorcas, who never did a thing unless when told, to lay the table, and they put upon it some cold bread and butter, and some preserves which Nancy had made, and sat down, leaving Mrs. Hopkins in the nursery. This was quite too much for her spirit to bear. She told Mrs. Harley that her place was at the table with herself and husband; that if she intended to make a servant of her, she would find out her mistake; and then, to show her title to the situation, she commenced a harangue upon her pedigree, making out her noble extraction, although Mrs. Hunt had told Mrs. Harley that she was extremely low, and her character rather questionable, notwithstanding the good recommendation she gave her. Poor, inefficient wife, how I wish I could relieve you! I long to discard your house-keeper, to bid you learn to govern, and become mistress of your family! Mr. Harley, of course, felt again disheartened. There seemed an end to all attempts at living with any comfort, and he communicated his thoughts again to his wife. But she bore up with a firmer spirit. She thought, if a cook could only be obtained, she should do well enough; and as she had heard of one that evening who was about leaving one of the neighbouring families, she entreated permission of her husband to make but this one more trial. The expense was not mentioned, and the indulgent husband granted the request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE NEW COOK AND NEW MANAGEMENT. “There is a firkin of butter wanting,” said Abigail, as she commenced her new apprenticeship, “and a barrel of flour, and another of sugar, and a bag of coffee, for aught I can see of any; and pray tell me where is the store-room, and the closet of crockery, and things to do with, for I suppose they don't expect me to make things out of nothing,” muttered the new-comer into the ears of Mrs. Hopkins. “Certainly not,” said she; and, drawing a little book from her pocket, she took her pencil and noted the necessary articles, to pass them over to Mr. Harley when he came home to dinner. Having finished the list enumerated by the cook, she furnished her own, which consisted of jars of olives and limes, drums of figs, boxes of raisins, &amp;c. She then handed the list to Mr. Harley, adding, “I have only put down the necessaries upon this account; the others I will give you at my leisure.” Mr. Harley took the items thus furnished into the nursery, and read them over to his wife, adding, “I see no reason why a house-keeper should be indulged in these last luxuries; do tell me if this is the fashion, to procure whatever their fancy may dictate: if so, I believe I will turn housekeeper myself.” “Now, Mr. Harley,” said the wife, “don't begin to find fault the first thing. We are out of these articles, and they are useful, I doubt not: Mrs. Hopkins is so experienced, she would not ask for unnecessaries. Do let her have the entire control for one month, at least, without fretting; by that time we can see how things will come out.” As much as Mr. Harley dreaded changes generally, now he almost desired them, for he saw the impositions thus commencing. The figs and olives were erased, for he resolved that they should not be procured; half the quantity of some of the other articles was ordered, while all Abigail's specifications were procured without finding a word of fault. The housekeeper's rage was enkindled when she E 2 saw that the handcart did not contain all the articles upon which she had set her fancy. She breathed out her invectives to Abigail in little Dorcas's hearing, ending them with, “I will come up with them yet.” These last words little Dorcas reported to her mistress, besides telling her that Abigail was going to make some poundcake for luncheon. This irritated Mrs. Harley, who, instead of proceeding to the kitchen to cast her eyes about there, bade Dorcas stop her tattling, and bring no reports to her ears; she expected the cook and housekeeper to attend to all those things; the cake was probably making for tea. Dorcas, thus rebuked, resolved, if they gave her any, she would never tell any more tales; so she crept softly into the kitchen about the time her olfactories told her the cake was smoking hot somewhere; but, seeing Mrs. Hopkins run with it to the closet as a safe retreat, while Abigail bade her “Go along up stairs and stop the everlasting crying of that child,” she deemed it best to make her retreat. “Dorcas, do stay here and attend to your business,” reiterated Mrs. Harley. The child, reproved alike in nursery and kitchen, took her seat beside the cradle of little sleeping John. By-and-by Mrs. Hopkins came up, and, in true palaver style, though much malice lay in her heart, hoping she did not intrude, begged permission to know what grocer in the neighbourhood Mr. Harley patronised. She would like to keep a little book account with one of them; it was so handy to run in such a place when you were waiting for some little thing. “But,” said Mrs. Harley, “my husband prefers to pay for such things at the time; if you want small change, he will always give it to you. He says the reason is, there is generally something added on each little article purchased, which is saved when paid for at the time. However, if it is really needful to have such an account, perhaps he will not object, if you ask him. I don't know about these matters, I am sure. Is not this a pretty frill for my satin dress, Mrs. Hopkins?” “Beautiful, indeed, ma'am: what a fine taste you have, Mrs. Harley. Poor Mrs. Hunt used to get me to make all her caps for her. She had no more taste than an owl. And is this the dress you are making it for?” continued the housekeeper, holding up a white satin that lay upon the bed. “How splendidly you will look, Mrs. Harley! I declare, I was telling Abigail yesterday nobody would take you to be a married lady, you look so young.” So saying, she ran down stairs, telling Abigail what a fool she had made of Mrs. Harley, by stuffing her with flattery; “For,” said she, “by that means I have got her consent to keep a little account at the grocer's, and I'll tell you what it is, it won't be a very small sum at the end of the year; however, it makes no difference to me: I shall be off before that time.” Dorcas (“the little plague” they used to call her) was now despatched to the grocer's for a variety of articles, and she was required to get a book, where they might be inserted, as Mr. Harley wished to open an account with him. The reader may wonder that Mrs. Hopkins did not go herself; but she knew well that, in the end, the step she had taken would occasion difficulty, and, if she did not order the book herself, the blame might, in part, be thrown upon Dorcas; at any rate, she or Abigail might be made responsible; for she could manage herself to evade it all, she artfully reasoned. Thus the book was obtained, the account commenced, and Mrs. Harley did not give herself the trouble to inquire about it. This indifference did not escape the eagle-eyed housekeeper, and she resolved to take advantage of it. Dorcas was an excellent errand girl; a little bribe would induce her to run herself almost to death. How often were her services required when Mrs. Harley was out! Little Johnny had to be tied in a chair, and left alone, while she was out doing the house-keeper's errands. If he fell over, which he sometimes did, of which proof was given by a burn or scratch, good Mrs. Hopkins was the first to tell his mother, adding, “Poor little dear, when children creep so fast, they are sure to go to the wrong place.” The bruise was faithfully rubbed and kissed, and all was well again. Thus was the shortsighted mother deceived even by Dorcas; for she soon followed the example of the housekeeper, because she was rewarded with a handful of figs or a nice cake whenever she pleased Mrs. Hopkins. Matters now went on swimmingly. This term is used, because they were literally all afloat. Mrs. Harley was out every morning, enjoying her delightful freedom. Mr. Harley was always served with food excellently cooked, and as the kitchen was prohibited ground to him, unless at night, after all had gone to rest, of course, things were in order for him to see at that time, as all they wished concealed was carefully put away, and he really began to feel as if his home might still yield him some enjoyment. The book was now kept at the grocer's entirely; for it was so often wanted, that Mrs. Hopkins said she could not take the trouble of it; besides, she feared lest Mr. Harley should get sight of it; and already leaf after leaf was filled with little sundries, from a cent's worth of yeast to those more expensive articles which gave such fine flavour to their soups, and such delicacies to their table. Mr. Harley sometimes wondered how it was that there was not oftener a call upon his purse. He never dreamed of the grocer's “little account.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. A PARTY PROPOSED. “Husband,” said Mrs. Harley, throwing herself upon the sofa, as she returned late from making some fashionable calls, and found him waiting for her to dine, “we must return some of our numerous obligations to people.” Here she ran to the centre table, and taking up a note, said, “Do look here; we have an invitation to Mrs. Howe's party the sixteenth of March, and this makes the second to which we have been invited without returning her civilities: it will not do; we must give a party. There never can be a better time than now to do so; we have good help, and, if we give it in the house, this will make all things go on smoothly; but I am thinking we had better adopt the last fashion, and go to Grubini's. We can be provided with everything there without any trouble; besides, it is the most genteel way of receiving one's friends.” “But you forget the enormous expense of doing so, my dear,” said Mr. Harley; “a party got up in this style would not amount to much short of five hundred dollars. If I should happen to have a note due that day, and wanted my five hundred, I should begin to wish that I had received my friends at home.” “Poh! poh!” said Mrs. Harley, “you commenced this style of talking a year or two ago, when business was dull; now you know you told me the other night you had sold more that day than would be sufficient to give half a dozen parties.” “Provided I received my pay for the goods, I should have added.” “There is always an if in the way when I propose anything fashionable or genteel, Mr. Harley; I suppose, though, we could manage very well with a party in the house. Our rooms are large, and the basement would do to set the supper-table in; or, in case it did not, we might remove the beds and throw open our chambers. Still, I should rather go to the Hall; the floor is so much better for dancing, and there would not be such a tremendous jam. At any rate, we will talk it over this evening; the bell is ringing for dinner now, and I will just throw off my cloak, and be down in a minute.” Sure enough, the dinner was ready, cooked to a nicety. The first course was vermicelli soup; next, a brace of ducks, beautifully roasted; then a black currant pudding, “as rich as wedding cake,” according to Mrs. Hopkins's assertion, for the recipe was taken from an old English cook-book. Both Mr. and Mrs. Harley rejoiced that at length things were arranged to their mind. During the afternoon Mrs. Harley's thoughts were busily engaged in making out the arrangements for the intended party. Thought she, “I must have a new dress—shall it be satin or velvet? The latter, I have understood, is the most worn this winter; and if I could contrive to get it trimmed with one of those golden wreaths, how splendidly it would look! besides, I could get my ostrich feathers coloured to match! but then husband will say it is silly to make such a parade—Oh dear! I wish he was more fond of living stylishly!” In the midst of these cogitations, Mrs. Gerrish entered. After the first complimentary phrases were over, Mrs. Gerrish said, “Are you going to F Mrs. Howe's party? I am really astonished that she should be so foolish as to give it in her own house; you remember how crowded we were at her last; I did think she would overcome her meanness, and go to Grubini's this time. You know I gave mine there; how I regretted your absence! To be sure, it cost a pretty penny, but what is money good for unless we can use it in this way once in a while. Besides, to have all the trouble saved is to be taken into the account; and then the supper-table is so splendidly spread, and all the company can get a sight of it there, and I rather think a taste too, for there was an immense quantity eaten at my ball! Still, Mrs. Harley, if you should ever give a party, do let me recommend you to the Hall.” Thus saying, she espied a friend in the street, and making a hasty excuse, joined her, leaving Mrs. Harley more strongly impressed than ever with the notion that it would be far better to pay a little more and appear like other people. With what busy thoughts did Mrs. Harley's brain now teem! What insurmountable obstacles lay in her way to the accomplishment of her purposes! How vainly she wished that she could overcome her husband's dislike to her nicely-concerted plans! She would be willing to economize in any way if she could only be indulged in this. She grew irritable; little John was ordered to the kitchen, because his noise made her head ache, and Dorcas, with her rattling knitting-needles, was enough to craze one. She looked at her watch, and finding there would be time to make a call before tea, slipped on her cloak and bonnet, and went to consult one of her fashionable confidantes as to what she could do! She found her friend busily engaged in arranging, or, rather, superintending the arrangement of her evening dress for a large cotillion party. It was a beautiful salmon-coloured velvet, trimmed with flowers. There was a French headdress called a toque, ornamented with feathers, which Mrs. Harley thought gave to the wearer a queen-like appearance. She carefully examined all parts of the dress, taking a pattern for her own. We will not repeat all that passed between the ladies, lest it should expose a great deal of manœuvring with which the world in general is unacquainted. The whole substance was, that a large party at one's house was troublesome, ungenteel, and a crowded sort of an affair. Mrs. Harley was now convinced she must conform to the fashion, in defiance of her husband's judgment. What a mere tool a thoroughly fashionable woman becomes! Mr. Harley came home to tea, and found his wife in a most excited state. She narrated to him how her friend had called, and what she said about parties; that she had been to her dear friend Emma's, and had seen a splendid dress, and heard her opinion, which perfectly coincided with Mrs. Gerrish's, namely, that she ought to give her entertainment at Grubini's; adding, “They both say it won't cost much more than to give a splendid one at home.” “Nonsense,” said Mr. Harley, “don't be such a dupe to these women; they may give their balls where they please, and I shall take the same liberty. It would sound pretty, I must confess, to have it reported about town that Harley &amp; Co. gave a party at Grubini's which cost six or seven hundred dollars. I have more regard to my credit than to do such a thing; besides, I remember one of your recommendations of Mrs. Hopkins was, that she understood so well how to prepare for parties.” In vain Mrs. Harley reasoned in favour of her own scheme: her husband, though usually indulgent, was not to be moved on this point, and she was forced to yield, though it cost her many tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">F 2 CHAPTER IX. A NEW FURNACE AND A NEW COOK. A difficulty now arose, not at all connected with the much-talked-of party. Mrs. Hopkins protested that she was never in so cold a house; that it took Dorcas full half the time to go to the door, and carry up coal for the nursery and parlour; she must have a furnace. It was enough for Dorcas, or any other girl, to take care of that mischievous little rogue Johnny, and it was a man's work to make fires, run on errands, &amp;c. “Now,” said she, “I believe I heard you talking of giving a party yesterday afternoon. It will be just the thing to get a coloured man, for he can carry the invitations, and attend to the door when the company arrives; and it will give quite an air of gentility to the establishment.” She forgot, when she spoke of having heard about the party, that she exposed herself to the suspicion of being a listener at the door, a thing she was quite in the habit of doing, that she might, by means of what she overheard, adapt herself to circumstances. Poor Mrs. Harley again felt a sinking of the heart. It appeared to her that no woman was ever tried like her before. Mr. Harley's reluctance to comply with her wishes rose before her, together with the housekeeper's continual demands for more help; and an intimation that Abigail would leave unless her wages were increased, tormented her extremely. In addition to all these things, Dorcas began to put on airs, and to answer with great impertinence, while she grew heedless, dirty, and careless of Johnny. Still, she dared not breathe her complaints to Mr. Harley until the party was over; that was the first and last thought about which time and money were alike expended. It so happened that Mr. Harley was engaged to a whist-party that evening, and as he never returned till she was asleep, she made no advance in any of her new plans till the next day. Early the next morning she interrogated her husband respecting the expediency of setting a furnace, alleging as a principal reason that their little boy was kept so cold creeping about the house, and it took Dorcas so much of the time to bring up the coal, that she should be thankful to have a uniform temperature with so little trouble. “I suppose,” said Mr. Harley, “this too is the wise instigation of the housekeeper.” But he had before thought that he must adopt some expedient to economize in coal, for during the past winter they had consumed double the quantity they did the last, yet they had been kept hardly comfortable; a fact which was undoubtedly to be attributed to Dorcas, who always left the doors open, unless when explicitly and at the time told to do otherwise. It therefore required no forcible argument to procure a furnace in the house. “I have been thinking, too,” said Mrs. Harley, “that we had better send out our invitations soon. Let us set a time, and shape our purposes accordingly: suppose we say the twenty-sixth of March? and the next thing is, whom shall we invite? and how many will our rooms hold? though we may venture to invite twice the number our house will accommodate, since not more than half the number will come. But whom shall we despatch with the invitations?” “Why not let Robert, our youngest boy at the store, take them? he knows all about the city,” said Mr. Harley. “Oh! dear husband, don't spoil the very beginning. There is Jethro Moody, who will take them all for a trifle; besides, we shall want him several days before and after the party. You know there is always a great deal of hurry before the time, and a great many calls after. We will keep him to go to the door.” “Somehow or other,” said Mr. Harley, “you seem to be growing amazingly stylish lately; who would know whether Jethro or Robert left the notes?” “Why, my dear, I heard Mrs. Gerrish ask yesterday, when an invitation came, who brought it? People think more of these little things than you are aware.” “It only shows that they have no large affairs to busy their heads about,” said Mr. Harley; “however, you may have Jethro, if you like; Robert is always employed at the store.” About ten on the same morning Mrs. Hopkins came up, delighted at having carried her purposes into effect, and informing Mrs. Harley that the man had come to see about the furnace, added, “It will make a great deal of dust and dirt, and whoever lives here while it is going on deserves higher wages than usual.” “Don't trouble me,” said Mrs. Harley; “go on just as you like. You know you are at perfect liberty to act as if the house were your own.” This liberty the worthy housekeeper had long ago assumed. While the confusion was so great in the house, Mrs. Harley thought it would be a favourable time to go out and select a dress for the party. She accordingly procured a pattern of every shade of velvet and satin, and teased the dressmakers, and racked her own brains to discover which would be the most becoming. It so happened that while the furnace was setting, and the bricks and mortar carried to the cellar, that the air of the house was colder than usual; and Dorcas, wishing to see all that was going on (being in favour with the housekeeper because she told no secrets), took Johnny into the kitchen. The consequence was, that, being predisposed to the croup, a violent cold brought on a severe attack of it, so that the succeeding night it assumed an alarming aspect, and, had not medical aid afforded a quick relief, the child could not have survived. In this critical season, we may say with truth that Mrs. Harley forgot entirely her dress and her party for the first time for many days. As soon, however, as the child appeared out of danger, she recommenced her perambulations, though not without charging Mrs. Hopkins to see that Dorcas did her duty and kept the doors shut. In a few days the furnace was completed, and answered its purpose admirably. But, doomed to perpetual change, as those must be who intrust the management of their affairs to others, Mrs. Harley was interrupted one morning by Abigail, who appeared, bundle in hand, demanding her wages. “Why, what has happened?” asked Mrs. Harley. “Happened! why, enough to provoke a saint, ma'am: that old jade of a housekeeper has stolen money from my trunk; and if you knew one half about her that I do, you would not give up your whole house to her in this way. If you miss anything, you need not accuse me of stealing! I could tell things enough, if I chose, about false keys, and going to your drawers when you are out, but I wont.” Abigail, having raised her voice above its natural tone, was overheard by Mrs. Hopkins, who stood listening in the entry. Fired with indignation, she burst into the room, and they criminated and recriminated each other, until Mrs. Harley was obliged to order them both out of the room, telling them she “did wish they would settle their own difficulties, as she had enough to do to write the invitations to her party.” “But if you will only pay me, I will be off,” said Abigail, “for I will not stay to the party with such a mistress as Mrs. Hopkins over me, I can assure you. If you will allow me to tell you a piece of my mind, I should think you had better look after your accounts at the grocer's, and find out who it is that puts Dorcas up to her impudence.” Do, Abigail, try and compose yourself,” said Mrs. Harley, “and stay till the first of April. Your work will be lighter now, since Jethro is coming to assist in the family.” “Oh la! I wouldn't live with a negro if I didn't hate that old Mrs. Hopkins. `Birds of a feather may flock together;”' and then she commenced another tirade full of insinuations about the housekeeper's trunks. At length, finding that she could not get her money till Mr. Harley came from the store, she laid her bonnet and bundle on the kitchen table, awaiting his return. “What can be done to keep things quiet till after the party,” thought Mrs. Harley. “Can Mrs. Hopkins be what Abigail says she is?” And then a vague suspicion came over her that an embroidered handkerchief which she had missed could not have dropped from her muff. Other things, too, had disappeared strangely; and what did the account-book mean? She hoped everything would not be disclosed by Abigail when Mr. Harley paid her. Then the thought struck her that she could go to the store and obtain money, and dismiss Abigail directly. But who would take her place? She resolved to let Mrs. Hopkins go and find some one for herself at the intelligence G office, where she kept a yearly account, for convenience' sake, as she was obliged to change so often. She related her plans to her confidential, trusty housekeeper, who, congratulating herself that she was likely to get off so easily, readily fell in with the proposal, and even offered to take upon herself the office of cook till one could be obtained. She had an eye to the party, and, moreover, was aware that in no other place could she so effectually cheat and blind the eyes of her employer. Mrs. Hopkins repaired immediately to the intelligence office, as she resolved that she would not lower herself by doing the drudgery of the family a single day, if she could help it. Not being very particular in her choice, she begged the keeper of the office to send a cook of some description that very day. Now a really good servant could not be easily induced to go to Mrs. Harley's, because they had acquired the reputation of being difficult to please, and of making frequent changes, while affairs were very badly managed. Mrs. Hopkins waited till the last moment before she went about preparing dinner. She had but a very simple one, because, as she alleged in the morning, she could not burn herself to death over the fire; but it was nearly completed, when, with paper in hand, giving proof that she was fresh from the office, a dejected, poorly-clad woman entered. Upon inquiry, she gave no very flattering account of herself. She had a bad husband, and two or three young children at board, and she wished to obtain the situation of cook, because she could command more wages in this department. As this latter clause did not trouble Mrs. Hopkins, and having perfect liberty delegated to her, she immediately agreed to give the new cook two dollars a week. Mrs. Harley returned to dinner with her husband, and Mrs. Hopkins explained to them that wages were rising, and knowing that there must be some extra work about the time of the party, she thought it best to pay liberally, and make them work freely. This satisfied Mrs. Harley far better than her husband. He inwardly detested Mrs. Hopkins, and resolved that, before long, her dismissal should make one of the many changes in his household.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. DISMISSAL OF THE HOUSEKEEPER. The changes in the domestic department occasioning Mrs. Harley no farther uneasiness, she set herself about the party in good earnest. There were but three weeks before the eventful evening would arrive, consequently they must soon determine who should be invited and who excluded. There were a few calling acquaintances whom she must cut; they were real bores at any time; for, whenever they returned her calls, she was always mortified if obliged to introduce them to her more fashionable friends, and she inwardly resolved to take this opportunity of dropping the acquaintance of all of this class: they were a good enough sort of people, but not accustomed to fashionable life, and would make most sorry figures in the room. With high determination to have a genteel party or none at all, Mrs. Harley sat down to discuss her list of invitations with her husband. He read it carefully, pausing occasionally, as he came to a name with whose owner he had not the slightest acquaintance, to ask his wife why they were selected; to which she unhesitatingly replied, that “She had met them in company, and it was rather in vogue to invite such people, if one fancied them. If they did not come, why, no farther mention need be made of it; if they did, it raised the character of the party.” This greatly amused Mr. Harley, and he proceeded: “But I don't see our friends the Bartons here, nor the Millers, nor Captain White's family. I hope you don't intend to omit such excellent people?” “Well, I did think, husband, I should not invite any of them. I know they are good people, but they would enjoy far better a visit in a social way; you know they seldom go to parties.” “No matter for that, my dear; they must be invited, and then they can act their pleasure about coming. I have no idea of bringing strangers to criticise our arrangements, while our real friends are excluded.” G 2 This last remark damped Mrs. Harley's high hopes. She begged Mr. Harley to let her have her own way about the invitations; adding, “Those I exclude will probably never hear I had a party.” “But we shall know it ourselves, and I should feel ashamed to meet those kind-hearted people, who have done so much for us, and know that I had purposely neglected them. No, no, they must be invited.” So saying, he put down ten names which Mrs. Harley had excluded. “I shall live, then, upon the hope that they will all send their `regrets,' Mr. Harley, for their daughters will only be wall-flowers all the evening,” said Mrs. Harley, quite irritated. “There won't be room for half I would like to have. Do put down Dr. Green, Professor Shaw, Dr. Baxter, and Colonel Lewis; they will be the literary part of the company, and we must furnish entertainment for some of our sensible ladies who never dance. I have met these gentlemen at Emma's and Mrs. Gerrish's, and there can be no harm in inviting them here.” “It appears to me, my dear, that it would be ridiculous in the extreme; I have no acquaintance with one of those you last named. We should confine ourselves to those we do know: I am sure there are enough in our circle of acquaintance.” Mrs. Harley apparently acceded to the proposal, but the next day wrote invitations to every one of the gentlemen; “For,” said she, “if Mr. Harley has his way in inviting all those dowdyish people because they are good, I will have these, for they will be the ornament of the party; and if they refuse, he will never know that they were invited.” In the course of the week, three hundred invitations were delivered by Jethro Moody, including all ages, and nearly all ranks in life, notwithstanding Mrs. Harley intended to have a really select party. And now the time had arrived when Mrs. Harley must decide on the quality and colour of her dress. She reopened all the patterns she had so assiduously collected, and feeling still undetermined, concluded to run down to her dressmaker's and let her select one for her. After a long consultation and deliberation, carried on with as much gravity as though the happiness of years was connected with it, they concluded that the salmon velvet would light the prettiest, and, being the most expensive, would of course be the most genteel. There seemed a fatality attendant upon both dress and party, for upon coming home Mrs. Harley found her husband very much excited about Mrs. Hopkins, whom he suspected of having stolen some money from his secretary. He was certain it was there the evening before, but this morning it was missing. He followed his wife into the nursery, and told her the particulars. She did not appear very much astonished or grieved, but calmly replied, “Well, my dear, let us make the best of it, and keep Mrs. Hopkins till after the party—she will be so useful.” Mr. Harley could be calm no longer, and exclaimed, “I will not keep her another week, wife! I entirely disapprove her management. She has already spent in the last three months more than it ought to have cost us for a year. I have overlooked her defects when they stared me in the face — ay, and her thievish propensities too, just to keep peace: only last night, as I was passing through the kitchen, I saw her give a large bundle to your new cook, and, not knowing that I was in hearing, she said, `Sally, take these things to the woman who has care of your children: it will pay their board for some time.' I was on the point of speaking, but there is such a continual change of help here, I thought I would keep still; but now I am determined to act: she shall be instantly dismissed, party or no party.” Mrs. Harley burst into tears. The mere thought of being obliged to oversee the house, just as she wanted all her time to herself, was what she could not endure. But Mr. Harley could be firm, although he had often yielded for the sake of quietness. He had had doubts whether little John was properly attended; and although he did not imagine that his wife was out half as much as she really was, yet the little fellow did not always look as neat and bright as he would like to have him. His wife, he knew, was dotingly fond of the child; but he feared that too much attention was bestowed upon her dress and appearance, and that Dorcas was not enough watched. This fear had preyed upon his mind for some time, yet he had kept it wholly to himself. Feeling just in the mood to utter all these secret thoughts at this time, every suspicion was divulged, and his entire disapprobation of her past management was not a whit concealed. He had seen far more than those in the house imagined, and he had come to the conclusion that a housekeeper must be possessed of different qualities from those of Mrs. Hopkins to make his home comfortable and prosperous. He told his wife so, and asking her how much they owed Mrs. Hopkins, which, of course, she did not know, as she cared for none of these matters, he asked her to inquire, as he wished to pay and dismiss her that very afternoon. “Do, husband, let her stay till I get my dress. What time shall I have to go out if you leave me alone with Sally? She has not half the faculty of Abigail with regard to work, Mrs. Hopkins says, and what can I do?” “Why, you had better shut up the house and send Dorcas and John in to the neighbours', than to keep such a deceitful, thievish creature,” said Mr. Harley, warmly. “I will take care myself of the affairs, if you do not, till we can find assistance. I was talking with our neighbour Mr. Cass last evening: he says he keeps but two domestics with his large family, and I am sure they live more comfortably than we do with three. I really believe, my dear, we have one too many, and I am disposed to live without a housekeeper.” “Then, of course, your wife must be a slave,” said Mrs. Harley. “Not so much of a slave as you imagine,” said Mr. Harley; “for, between ourselves, I think Mrs. Hopkins has kept us both in pretty good subjection. I intend to pay her and send her off this afternoon; and I charge you not to have any private conversation with her, nor even intimate that it is your wish she should stay longer. I will aid you if you need any assistance; we can live in a more simple way, and it will be better for our health, as well as our circumstances.” So saying, he walked to the dining-room, where sat Mrs. Hopkins, busied, as usual, about her own affairs. Without preface or apology, in true business style, Mr. Harley began: “Mrs. Hopkins, how much am I indebted to you? Whatever it is, I wish to discharge it, as we have no farther occasion for your services.” The housekeeper was thunderstruck; but, conscious of her own demerit, she rather faintly inquired “Why she was so abruptly turned out of doors?” Mr. Harley replied that “He wished to have no conversation upon the subject; all he wanted was to know the amount he owed her.” Mrs. Hopkins and Mrs. Harley had kept a sort of running account, or, rather, Mrs. Harley had often let Mrs. Hopkins have a few dollars at a time, and it being rather troublesome to put it on a book, she had charged her memory with it, and that proving very treacherous, the result was that they were obliged to abide by the housekeeper's statement, who said that she had never had any money but twice, making quite a sum for her still to receive, as she had been housekeeper for two dollars and a half a week for thirteen weeks, she said. Incorrect as Mr. Harley believed this statement to be, he could not refute it, as he had kept no date of her entrance; and, therefore, paying her without a word, though his countenance clearly indicated his opinion, he told her he would send a carriage to convey her wherever she wished that afternoon. Having the money safely in her own keeping, and feeling that she should never get another place equal to this, she cooled down her wrath, and offered to stay for half that sum until she had time to look about her for a situation; “For,” she said, “that privilege is always given to housekeepers.” But Mr. Harley was not to be duped any longer; he told her “That she had not half earned the money he had given her, and she could well afford to pay for her board till she could obtain a place.” Indignant in the extreme, Mrs. Hopkins proceeded to the kitchen, and finding Sally an easy subject to work upon, she told her of her “unhandsome dismission,” and gave it as her opinion that Sally had better look out for another place as quick as possible, for under her new mistress she would find things sadly altered. She waited below till she heard Mr. Harley close the door, and then proceeded to pour her complaints, highly exaggerated, into the ears of his wife, while she, with too little H independence to rebuke her, could only say, “Well, well, Mrs. Hopkins, I cannot help it.” Just before she left, the housekeeper gave Dorcas, too, a sly wink, telling her “She would find her a good place whenever she left this hard one — one where she would be better treated than to be dragged to death with that child!” Having thus set the whole house in a state of fermentation, she departed. The first evidence of her interference did not appear till the next morning, when Sally, just after breakfast, demanded her wages, saying she should leave that morning. Mrs. Harley immediately repaired to her husband's store, and acquainted him with her new trials, all of which she ascribed to sending away the housekeeper. Mr. Harley was just negotiating some business of importance, and was not in a situation to be troubled with home affairs. He only told his wife to pay Sally and let her go, and said, if she went before dinner, she might send to Julien's for one. Mrs. Harley went home with a lightened heart. It seemed to her that the plan of sending for dinners already prepared was admirable; she wondered that they had not thought of it before; and mentally added, “I can get my dress this afternoon if Sally does go away.” Full of this determination, she entered the house, when the first thing that met her eyes was Dorcas crying. She knew not what to make of it, as the child appeared sullen, and would not answer her repeated question of “What is the matter?” Sally, too, preferred to go before dinner, as she had to remove one of her children that afternoon, and must find her a place that morning; all of which served for a very good excuse, seeing there was no foundation in the story. Once more was Mrs. Harley left with Dorcas. Resolving to discuss the matter in the evening with her husband, she went, as she had premeditated, that very afternoon, and ordered the salmon-coloured velvet dress to be sent home, with the bill, and purchased some very expensive lace for the trimming of the dress. Upon returning, she found her husband annoyed that she had left the house, especially as Dorcas had made no preparation for tea, having little disposition to please, since Mrs. Hopkins had repeatedly told her she would find her a better place. Just after Mrs. Harley's entrance, the bell rang, and a boy left a bundle: it was the dress and bill. “Is it not beautiful, husband?” asked Mrs. Harley, as she opened it; “the shade is divine! How pretty it will light! and now the next thing is to have it made. I must let these house affairs go, and attend to it; it would be a shame to have it spoiled.” “My dear,” said Mr. Harley, “what shall we have for tea?” “Oh, dear! I am sure I don't know; let Dorcas run and get a loaf of bread. Oh! this everlasting din of cooking! I wish we were at board.” Mr. Harley had not yet found an opportunity to tell his wife of a plan of his, she was so much engaged in talking of her dress. It was, to send to an adjoining town, where he had a widowed aunt, who superintended a gentleman's house, and see if he could persuade her to take charge of his establishment. Having at length disclosed his intention to his wife, he found she did not altogether approve of having a relation to take charge; still, in defiance of her judgment, he wrote, making the offer to his aunt, and saying that a liberal compensation would be most gladly allowed for her aid. Mrs. Harley's thoughts being wedded to her dress and party, made her almost regardless of these changes. She only wanted deficiencies supplied, and accordingly sent a note to the office, telling them to send her a cook without delay. It happened that Dinah Johnson, a coloured woman, who had been many years in service, was waiting for a direction at the time when Dorcas went in with the note. She was accordingly despatched with the little girl to Mrs. Harley's as a cook. Dinah was a stout, healthy woman, without much experience in cookery, but a good house-servant, if watched; as proof of which, she had lived, she said, “with good Master Cummings fifteen years, till the day of his death.” Mrs. Harley was much pleased with Dinah's appearance, and gave her immediate charge of the kitchen. Mr. Harley did not know but that she would do as well as anybody. He thought he would observe her, and, provided she did well, would keep her. Dinah told her H 2 master she saw but one thing wanting—it was a cooking-range. If she burned the meat, or but half baked the bread, it was always because she had been used to the range. So, to remedy the insurmountable difficulties, a week before the party a cooking-range was set. Mr. Harley, in the mean time, received an answer from his widowed aunt, saying that she had laid the whole subject before Mr. Prout, with whom she resided; and although he could not think of parting from her entirely, yet she could pass a month with her nephew, and, perhaps, restore the order he wished. Jethro Moody was now employed for the sake of going on errands in preparation for the party. But, to Mrs. Harley's utter astonishment, the regrets came in much faster than the acceptances. There was an excuse from Colonel Lewis on account of “a previous engagement;” Dr. Baxter pleaded “illness in his family;” and numerous others “regretted it was not in their power to accept Mrs. Harley's polite invitation.” Chagrined beyond measure, Mrs. Harley felt almost sorry she had thought of giving a party. Nobody she cared about would see her beautiful dress! Instead of appearing in it for the first time in her own house, she resolved to wear it to Mrs. Howe's on the sixteenth. If so few of the élite were going to accept her invitation, and those only came who she had hoped would decline, she concluded not to feel so ambitious about it, and not to urge Mr. Harley to give a more splendid entertainment than other people. That evening they were to decide what would be necessary, as the men who took charge of the whole were waiting for directions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. DISCLOSURES. “It will cost a great deal more than I anticipated for our party,” said Mr. Harley, as he enumerated the expense of the articles which the waiters said would be necessary. “Pray let me see what is on the list,” said Mrs. Harley; “I hope they have put down something uncommon; I do not want just what everybody else has. We will observe Mrs. Howe's table to-night, and if we can think of any addition which will be an improvement, we will have it.” “Your ambition seems reviving,” observed Mr. Harley. “No wonder,” replied Mrs. Harley; “we have finally succeeded in getting the Bentons. You know what an air of gentility they give to a party: they waltz splendidly; and, sure as you are alive,” continued she, as she opened a note just handed her, “here are the acceptances of the Coles, who have just returned from Paris: well, I am quite encouraged. Now let me see the list of things to be procured—oysters, ham, tongue, chicken for salad, ice cream, blanc mange, jellies, candies, Champagne, Hock, old Sherry—dear me! I don't wish to read all these items; I should not wonder if they amounted to nearly five hundred dollars,” said Mrs. Harley, quite unconcernedly, “for you know you have not included the music and the lights: pray don't forget any of these things: it will be as much as I can do to get myself ready, without being troubled about the house.” Mr. Harley sighed as he looked at the amount he had roughly calculated, whistled a low tune, took his hat, and went to the store. About ten the bell rang violently, and Mrs. Harley, exceedingly impatient to know who had accepted or rejected her invitations, not thinking for a moment it could be any one else, bade Dorcas run to the door, as Jethro was probably engaged. Dorcas soon returned, saying she left the man waiting for an answer. Mrs. Harley hastily opened the paper, and discovered the bill for groceries, amounting to the small sum of two hundred and forty-three dollars and fifty-six cents. Accompanying the bili was the little book specifying the sundries. Mrs. Harley glanced at the amount, and bade Dorcas tell the lad that her husband would settle it the next morning: she then laid it upon her secretary, and gave herself no farther concern about it. Dinah managed affairs tolerably well, but she found the kitchen utensils “shocking dirty, and everything used up,” as she expressed it; but, as Jethro was insinuating himself in her good graces, she made the best of it, because, she said, “her mistress, dear good lady, was so full of the party, she hated to trouble her till it was over.” Mrs. Harley went out to procure a few little things to wear to Mrs. Howe's, and engage the hair-dresser. In the interval Mr. Harley came home, and espying the folded bill, examined it silently for some minutes. “Dorcas,” said he, at last, “did you ever go to Plumer's, the grocer, for Mrs. Hopkins?” “Yes, sir,” answered Dorcas, “every day, and sometimes two or three times a day.” “And why did you go,” inquired Mr. Harley, “without my knowledge? You know you never did before that woman came here.” “Because, sir, she told me to, and I was obliged to do as she bade me.” Mr. Harley was obliged to check the warmth of his temper, knowing the child was not so much in fault, and taking up the book, began to read over the articles specified. The source from which their nice dinners came was discovered now. He grew more furious still as he found many things registered which he knew never came to the table, but which must have been consumed by the ravenous housekeeper and her visiters. He regretted very much that the book had not been sent before she was dismissed. The truth was, it would not have been sent at that time, but, since Mrs. Hopkins had left, there had been a cessation of their demands, and thinking this might be caused by some pique of which he was ignorant, the grocer thought it best to present the bill; as it happened, it could not have been sent in a worse time. Mr. Harley walked out of the house, mortified, irritated, and self-condemned, because he had not kept a more vigilant eye over the manœuvring which had been carried on with so high a hand for the last three months. He returned late to dinner. The season had arrived when their heaviest payments became due, and he had been disappointed in not being able to raise money from sources which had hitherto proved unfailing. To be obliged, then, to pay debts which he never suspected he owed, was a most galling circumstance. For the hundredth time, he wished that his wife would give her attention more to household affairs. Perhaps Aunt Ruth would produce a favourable change when she arrived. Full of these reflections, he entered his house with rather a desponding air, and seated himself upon the sofa with his hand upon his head. His wife came to him. “Now, husband,” said she, “do cheer up; I feel just in the mood to go to a party to-night. My dress has come home, and it fits beautifully: I rather think that it will be the handsomest one there to-night; but I want some money to pay the hair-dresser who is coming to the house this afternoon. What is the matter? Have you a headache, or are you sick of the party?” “Neither,” said Mr. Harley; “but I am heart-sick, Mary. Our expenses are so numer ous, we must contrive to reduce them, or we shall be ruined. I will try to get through with this party, and then we must have some new arrangements, or entirely abandon the idea of keeping house at all.” “And all this tirade, I suppose, is just because I spoke of the hair-dresser,” said the unreflecting wife. “As to the party, I am sure you wanted it as much as I did; and unless we can have things like other people, I don't care whether we keep house or not. If you had not looked so desponding, I meant to have asked you to get a suit of damask curtains for our parlours. Mrs. Gilbert says there will be plenty of time to make them.” “Don't, wife, ask for any more of these extravagances, I entreat you: we must curtail our expenses; we can do it, I know; we can do with less help and less company, and I shall expect you to oversee a little more.” This was the most delicate hint he could give to his wife, yet it greatly wounded her feelings. She shed tears, said “she never expected to drudge in kitchens nor look after servants; she would like to break up house-keeping that very day, if it were not for the party.” Mr. Harley felt again disheartened. He began I to fear lest he never should make his wife understand her appropriate sphere. She had so long been indulged in the exercise of her taste, and devoted herself so exclusively to her person, that all required beyond this narrow sphere seemed to proceed from a design to abridge her freedom. With these notions, what improvement could be expected? She went to the glass, wiped her eyes, and sat down to the hair-dresser; and as she surveyed herself in her new dress by a mirror which reflected all her person, she turned to her husband and exclaimed, “Is not this becoming?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE PARTY. The account at the grocer's remained unsettled; there were so many demands for cash, and the very fact of owing it being a proof of such domestic mismanagement that Mr. Harley could not endure to think of it. Mrs. Howe's party was a splendid affair. It gave Mrs. Harley new strength to encounter her numerous vexations, because she felt it added very much to one's happiness to have an opportunity to make so public a display. She really longed for her night to come. Mr. Harley, too, although from different motives, said “he should be thankful to say it was well over.” We will pass by the intervening difficulties which every day brought with it, together with bad management in the kitchen, and trouble in the nursery, and mistakes in the parlour, and place ourselves in Mr. Harley's house on the morning of the twenty-sixth of March. Mrs. Harley rose an hour earlier than usual to have breakfast over, so that all might have time to discharge their duties. By some misunderstanding, the glass and china to be used that night did not arrive till morning, and in the hurry of washing and wiping, several valuable articles were broken. The carpenter came to fix up the ornaments for the side-lights, and to plane the floors, while a man was waiting to chalk out the figures, which were to be obliterated in much less time than he was employed in tracing them. Oysters were being delivered at the back door, wines at the front. Jethro was running in one direction, Dinah in another. Beds were to be taken down, tables to be arranged, lamps filled, and flowers put into their vases: altogether, such a scene of confusion presented itself, that Mrs. Harley, half in desperation, sat herself down, and began reading, for the fourth time, the list of acceptances and refusals. While doing so, the thought struck her that several were omitted who ought to have been invited. However, it was then too late to remedy the evil. About nine the first carriage arrived, filled with Mr. and Mrs. Barton and their two daughters, the very people whom she had hoped would not come. Soon after came the Millers and Rodmans—all very sensible people, yet not so fashionable as was thought desirable by Mrs. Harley. Then came a whole train too numerous to mention: in short, out of three hundred invited, two hundred actually came. The furnace, having been replenished by Jethro, who thought, as company was coming, he must have a good fire, sent forth a most intense heat, which, as the crowd thickened, became insupportable. The windows were raised, at the imminent danger of stiff necks, lame shoulders, and severe colds, since no one could dance in this heated atmosphere. The music, which had been admirably selected, sounded miserably, on account of the crowd. About twelve there was a tremendous rush to the supper-table. Blonde laces were torn, dresses stepped upon, elbows protruded in vain to force a passage, as not more than half the guests could get a sight of Mrs. Harley's elegant supper-table. On the whole, the entertainment was pronounced a decided failure. In an hour or two the people dispersed, and Mr. and Mrs. Harley were left to their reflections, which were not the most agreeable. Mr. I 2 Harley's were, that he had given a party which cost him upward of three hundred dollars, and that many of the company had had no opportunity to see or taste what his bounty had provided. Mrs. Harley looked sadly upon her dress, on which some one had spilled a glass of wine, which ruined it entirely. She felt heart-sick herself, for she had observed the countenances of some of the party, which expressed anything but satisfaction. She could not but think that it was a very heartless affair to visit in a crowd: it was not worth half the trouble it occasioned. Mr. Harley thought it was not worth half the expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII AUNT RUTH. The next day, Mr. Harley, having settled all the bills for the preceding evening, took the account which the grocer had presented, and exhibited it to his wife, not knowing that she had seen it, in the midst of her excitement about the party. He gave her a full account of what he considered to be the fraud of the housekeeper, the duplicity of the cook, even the secrecy of Dorcas, who knew she was doing wrong at their instigation. “I shall pay this bill,” continued he, “but it will be the last time I shall be thus duped by surrendering my rights to the care of an artful housekeeper.” He then looked over the items as they appeared in the book, and painful as it was to Mrs. Harley, he requested her to hear them. “Here,” observed he, “are butter, flour, sugar, eggs, and a number of other articles, which could not have been consumed by us, as there was a full supply of these articles when those people came into the house. It is shameful to suffer one's self to be so imposed upon. What did they do with the firkins and boxes these things came in?” asked he of Dorcas, who was amusing Johnny; “I never saw them.” “They are in the lower cellar,” answered Dorcas, “excepting what was split to kindle the fire.” Just at this time Aunt Ruth arrived. Mrs. Harley received her with more cordiality than she felt, having no very great desire that her husband's aunt should witness such poor specimens of housekeeping as would everywhere meet her in the house. Mr. Harley was truly delighted to see her. Aunt Ruth was not one of your overbearing, fault-finding managers, who assert that “things ought to be done so and so,” but with great gentleness she moved from one place to another, directing here, and assisting there, until she found all her aims accomplished. She proceeded upon such a delightful and easy system, that she seldom changed her help unless they married or died; thus she had acquired the reputation of being a “perfect mistress of a family.” To pass a few weeks with her nephew at this time was no very enviable situation; but, assuming no airs, and feeling that she had come into the family for a short time only, and for the express purpose of making herself useful, she had a conversation with Mr. Harley and his wife the very evening she arrived, part of which I will narrate. “I saw, William,” she began, “by the tenour of your letter, that you were troubled with faithless servants. Why is it I hear so much about difficulties of this kind in this city? I scarcely see a lady who does not tell me some pitiful tale of her servants' prodigality, want of order and system; of their faithlessness when she is out; of their deceit or theft, and sometimes of their intemperate habits. To me all this is a perfect riddle, for I never had such trials in my thirty-seven years, housekeeping.” “Because you live in the country,” said Mrs. Harley, “where servants are better than they are here: they have no temptations to do wrong there.” “They fear to do it, more likely,” said Mr. Harley, “under the eye of such a mistress.” “No, I think that is not all, William,” said Aunt Ruth; “I think a part of the trouble results from the employers as well as the employed. Ladies are not sufficiently interested in domestic life; they feel as though it were a weight which they could throw off upon their domestics. Their mothers have been unfaithful in not requiring them to take a part in superintending in their father's family before they enter upon one of their own; and, consequently, they feel as though it were a kind of menial labour, unbecoming their station; while the truth is, by this neglect they become the servants of those whom they employ. I have heard such people often laughed at by the very help in whom they repose all their confidence.” “Well, for my part,” said Mrs. Harley, “I do think it is perfect drudgery to oversee one's affairs; besides, servants always detest those bustling women who are forever looking after them. I should have changed much oftener than I have, had my eyes followed them about their employment. Mrs. Hopkins, my last housekeeper, used to say, `Keep yourself up stairs, Mrs. Harley, and your help will do very well; but come down among them, and you lose your dignity at once.”' “Who made that remark, my dear?” inquired Aunt Ruth, mildly. “A designing, artful woman,” answered Mr. Harley, without giving his wife time to speak; “one to whom we intrusted everything, but who abused our confidence, and whose artifices I was just exposing to my wife as you came in.” Here he gave her the particulars of the grocer's account, and some other deceptions he had discovered. “But why,” said Aunt Ruth, “did you have a housekeeper? Was Mrs. Harley ill, or did she find the cares too great for her?” “Neither,” said Mr. Harley; “I suppose she found it fashionable to keep one for appearance' sake. I am sure I saw no good she did. However, I think we have both been taught by experience that we had better be our own housekeepers. I wish you would teach my wife your system, for we are determined to begin to live with less expense. Why, how much do you suppose I have paid, Aunt Ruth, for incidental expenses since January—or about twelve weeks—including fires, help, party, and everything, excepting dress?” Aunt Ruth hesitated: “She knew little of city life,” she said; “but, supposing they had not been very economical, perhaps their expenses amounted to three hundred dollars.” “Bless me,” said Mr. Harley, “it is more than seven hundred!” “Seven hundred!” repeated Aunt Ruth; “why, you could buy a small farm for that sum. It does appear to me that you might save a good deal; indeed, I do not see how you could spend so much.” “La!” said Mrs. Harley, “some people spend that sum in one evening for a party. What is the use of having money, if it is all hoarded, where it does no one any good?” “Very true, Mary,” replied Aunt Ruth; “but you know we are accountable for the use we make of our wealth. It appears to me that every one should set apart something for the good of others; besides, we ought to provide for the future, lest, by any accident, we should be rendered incapable of activity and farther accumulation. I had a neighbour once, who lavished all she could obtain upon herself—dressed richly, and gave splendid entertainments—yet was always excusing herself from visiting the needy, because her time was so fully occupied with her numerous friends. At length her husband failed, and they were obliged to sink into comparative obscurity, deserted entirely by those butterfly friends who had basked in her sunshine.” “It is a pretty fair sample of the conduct of worldly friends,” said Mr. Harley. “Mary and I gave a party to some friends last night. She spent her time and thoughts upon it for a number of weeks, and to-day she has been in the `horrors,' lest they saw something to be offended or to laugh at.” “Now, husband, don't say so; I have been troubled because my dress, on which I expended so much, is nearly ruined.” “How much did it cost, dear?” inquired Aunt Ruth. “Let her guess, William,” said Mrs. Harley. “Thirty dollars,” said Aunt Ruth, “if you will set me to guessing.” “It cost me fifty-six dollars,” replied Mrs. Harley; “and if I had had my way in trimming K it, it would have been seventy-five. However, I am glad now I did not, for there was such a crowd, it looked just as well plain.” “Do not talk any more to me of such round numbers,” said Aunt Ruth; “I shall be really frightened, and think William will fail without any doubt. I don't wonder he thinks of reducing his expenses.” “To be serious, aunt,” said Mr. Harley, “will you lend us your assistance in this work of reform? I have been examining my affairs lately, and find I cannot, with safety, exceed two thousand dollars a year. If I continue as we have gone on this winter, ruin must ensue, and if it is possible to avert it, I pray you to help us before it is too late. I do not wish you to labour, of course; but I have such a high opinion of your system of housekeeping, that I wish you would put it in practice here. And I shall want you, Mary, to attend to Aunt Ruth, and profit by every hint she gives, and try to follow her example. We will begin to-morrow; and first of all, we will send Jethro away; all he does is to tease and laugh at Dinah.” “Don't, Mr. Harley, turn him away till the ladies have called who came to the party; he will be so prompt to attend to the door. Everybody will think then that we keep a man constantly,” cried Mrs. Harley. “That will not add to my credit in the least,” said Mr. Harley, “and I am determined to dismiss him to-morrow. What do you say to it, Aunt Ruth?” “William,” said she, “I shall find myself treading on delicate ground if I give my opinion contrary to your wife's ideas; I am sure I would not, for the world, interfere with her rights, or injure her feelings.” “If you will only see that things go on well in the kitchen,” replied Mrs. Harley, “I will engage not to take offence—only don't make me a drudge.” “Certainly not,” said the kind aunt; “no lady deserves that appellation because she oversees her own affairs. I recollect a remark of an eminent divine, which struck me when I read it: `Economy is the order of the universe: no woman should think it beneath her to follow in her household the rule which governs the operations of Providence.”' “But does it not involve one in a great deal of care and anxiety?” inquired Mrs. Harley. “You know I have not much time to give to domestic concerns, as John requires so much care. Besides, ladies must go out a great deal, and be dressed to receive company: how can they do all this and work?” “My dear, you confound all good management with labour: this is not correct. You can go to your kitchen after breakfast, take a survey of things, direct what shall be done, give orders about your dinner, and if your servants are faithful and capable, they will execute your directions. If not, you have an opportunity of discovering it; but if you are never seen in your kitchen, they become careless and indifferent like yourself.” “You see, my dear, that is good reasoning,” said Mr. Harley. “Now, to please me, I wish you to begin to-morrow, and try what you can do. I will provide just as many servants as you wish, if you will see they are properly employed.” Mrs. Harley yawned, gave a kind of assent, and here the conversation ended for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. REFORMS. It is a wise decree, that all who spend their early years in fashionable dissipation should suffer a just retribution for such conduct. This never fails to be perceived when a woman becomes mistress of a family; the ennui and lassitude which follow in the train of such a course cannot be overcome, unless the responsibilities of the office awaken a new energy, and give a fresh impulse to the character. We have already seen the ruinous effects of this fashionable mania. The folly of intrusting to others the duties which a wise Providence designed as a wholesome discipline to ourselves, the slavery it engenders, the weakness it fosters, and the debasing influence it exerts upon the immortal mind, which can only strengthen itself by vigorous exertion. But, it may be asked, cannot we retrieve such a character from this thraldom, if we arouse it to see the waste of its powers? I K 2 would fain speak in the tone of encouragement, for we have noble instances of such emancipation. Still, I would caution mothers not to trust to this uncertain result; for, although a person, fortified by strong principles, may redeem much of the evil of the past, yet what can efface the consciousness that the best period of life has been misused? Tears will not wear away the impression, regrets cannot justify such a course. We shall see how it operated in the instance of Mrs. Harley. Aunt Ruth, as we before intimated, was to take charge of the family while she remained, and, if possible, bring about a better order in its affairs. She rose early the next morning, as was her uniform custom, and finding no one stirring in the house, rapped upon Dinah's door, and inquired “if she had overslept herself.” “Oh no, ma'am,” was the answer; “but Mrs. Harley bade me not be over-particular in getting up too soon, and that dog of a Jethro kept me so late last night, that I thought I would lie a little longer.” However, she roused herself at Aunt Ruth's mild request, and called Dorcas, who, not approving of this innovation, rose sullen and ill-natured. Aunt Ruth proceeded to the kitchen, and thought she would watch Dinah's progress in preparing breakfast without attempting any dictation. She could not but observe gross defects everywhere. The bread had not risen, Dinah having confessed that she forgot the yeast; the water did not boil when she poured it on the coffee, and the whole appearance of the kitchen and all the cooking utensils was dirty in the extreme. The coal was burning dimly in the range, and Aunt Ruth did not wonder that her nephew wished some new management. She cast a glance into the closet, and there were piles of washed and unwashed dishes, with fragments of bread, meat, and potatoes rolling off the plates; wrecks of crockery, which indicated that there had once been a large supply of useful things; while dust, dirt, empty boxes, and dull tinware made up the remainder. She opened but one stone jar: it was filled with mouldy crusts, which apparently were put there long before Dinah came. She went to the cold and cheerless parlour, where Dorcas was bedimming, not brightening, an Olmstead stove: as a proof of her neatness, she was rubbing it with her clean checked apron. Having done this, and made a sort of an apology for a fire, she proceeded to lay the table for breakfast. This she did by putting on the cloth askew, dusting the waiter with the same apron she had used before, and putting on one thing at a time; all of which Aunt Ruth observed without comment, as she wished to be a spectator, so as to know better where to apply the reforming principle. Mr. Harley rose in season for breakfast, and so did little John: Mrs. Harley, not having recovered from the fatigues of the party, begged to be indulged in a morning nap. The reader can imagine the flavour of such a breakfast; yet, as it was a fair specimen of Dinah's management, Mr. Harley offered no excuse to his aunt. They resumed the conversation of the past evening, and it being obvious to his kind aunt that a sweeping reformation was needed— that Dinah would not do for a cook, nor Jethro for a footman, nor Dorcas for an errand girl, unless she could be very much improved—she agreed, with Mr. Harley's consent, to commence her operations that very day. This she did with full confidence in her own powers, yet with a kind of shrinking delicacy, as she knew her path must be rather complicated before a perfect system could succeed. Mr. Harley lent his aid and dismissed Jethro, which not pleasing Dinah, made her very refractory under her new mistress; and Aunt Ruth, finding “soft answers” sometimes failed in turning away wrath, told her that, as the care devolved now upon her to superintend, she would dispense with her services that afternoon. It was her maxim that “poor help was generally worse than none;” and as the introduction of a new mistress is often the cause of the removal of the domestics, the change was not to be wondered at. We will now take a survey of the new arrangements one week after Aunt Ruth had been busily employed in putting things to rights. She did not require Mrs. Harley to give her any assistance in the kitchen until she had revolutionized the whole face of affairs, or, in her language, “had seen that the house was thoroughly clean from the garret to the cellar.” This she did most faithfully, with the aid of a woman who was hired daily, to do whatever she was bade. While this process was going on, the reader will anticipate the greatest tumult; but it was not so: Aunt Ruth quietly took room by room, and thus showed her good management, instead of putting the whole house in an uproar at once. She then requested her nephew and his wife to go with her over the house, and see if everything was arranged as they wished. It is needless to add that no fault could be found. A change was also manifested in the culinary department. Mr. Harley could not comprehend why he was not every day obliged to go to market, while he saw, with astonishment, that his food was far more palatable and wholesome than it ever had been before, even in the luxurious days when Mrs. Hopkins was housekeeper. Mrs. Harley did not think the cooking was so rich, but acknowledged that it tasted better. One day, after partaking a finely-cooked dinner, Mr. Harley said to his wife, “I hope, my dear, you do not fail to take daily lessons while Aunt Ruth is with us. You must remember, we cannot hope to retain her a great while, and it is incumbent on you to improve this present opportunity.” “Oh!” carelessly replied Mrs. Harley, “we are to have a girl she has had under her training when she leaves; aunt has kindly promised to give her up, and says she knows the girl will be glad to come.” “I said, my dear,” replied Aunt Ruth, “if you would first learn to direct her, I thought she would make you an excellent servant; but you have not been in the kitchen with me yet: when shall I see you begin to learn?” “Not this week,” exclaimed Mrs. Harley, “for you know I am expecting many ladies to call: those who refused, as well as those who accepted my invitations, will be here this week, and I must be dressed to see them.” “Not early in the morning, Mary,” said Mr. Harley. “You can go down a little while every day, and yet be dressed seasonably.” “La! Mr. Harley, Aunt Ruth can leave me a few written receipts when she goes, and, with the aid of those and a good cook, I can direct that good girl as well as if I knew how myself. There is no need of my remembering, or trying to remember, all the approved methods of doing this thing or that: it would take me a lifetime.” Thus reasoned the flighty wife: so little interested was she in the pleasant effects of good housekeeping. Yet, nevertheless, in compliance with her husband's wishes, she did proceed, by slow and imperceptible degrees, to feel a little interest in Aunt Ruth's proceedings before the week was completed. She promised Mr. Harley to give it more attention after the calls were finished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE RESULTS OF A FASHIONABLE PARTY. In truth, it was rather a difficult matter for Mrs. Harley to commence learning domestic arts at that time. The house was so thronged with company from one o'clock to three every day, it could not fail to have a dissipating influence upon the mind; besides, there were other vexations; for who ever gave a party without offending some one who claimed to be considered their friends? Mrs. Harley was very unfortunate in this respect. There were the Carters, whom she had entirely forgotten, and they had been loudly declaiming against such a direct slight; and old Mrs. James told Mrs. Gerrish “she should as soon have thought of having been neglected by her own daughters, for she had always been like a mother to Mrs. Harley.” Mr. and Mrs. Hatch, former friends of Mrs. Harley's mother, told Emma “they should never call again; for if they were not acknowledged L as friends in public, they should not try to be in private;” while, to make the matter worse, Emma added, “I am very sorry, dear Mary, for you, it makes you so liable to censure; for, between ourselves, do you know you committed an unpardonable error in not inviting Sister Billings?” “You don't tell me she is offended!” cried Mrs. Harley; “why, I would rather have lost half my acquaintances than her friendship, she is so sensible and agreeable; but I thought she never attended large parties. I am sorry— very sorry. How can I atone for it, Emma?” Say nothing about it, for pity's sake,” said Emma. “It only makes a bad matter worse to tell a friend you forgot her. If you had only let me have seen your list, I should have added several others. You omitted the Paines: they ought, by all rules of courtesy, to have been invited.” “But you know,” answered Mrs. Harley, “they are in deep mourning. Surely they would not have accepted.” “Never mind that, my dear; they ought to have been invited.” Poor Mrs. Harley was again heart-sick. She could not discover that her party delighted any one who came, while it made bitter enemies of those she had forgotten. In the midst of these reflections, Colonel Morton entered. “I regretted,” said he, very politely, “that I could not attend your party, Mrs. Harley. I have been informed there was a brilliant assemblage, and I hear Miss Tilman was the belle of the evening. But do tell me why Mr. Morlay was not here?” Mrs. Harley blushed, and frankly owned that till that moment she had entirely forgotten him as much as if he never were in existence. “Well, I dare say,” observed the colonel, with his usual pleasant manner, “you can make it all right with him. You must make another party, and invite all the disaffected ones to come together.” The very thought of that made Mrs. Harley shudder. Everything was continued in the same quiet comfort as when Aunt Ruth first restored it. She had a temporary servant till Marianne, of whom we spoke before, could come, which was not until the company had ceased calling; for her former mistress wisely judged that so many people would dishearten her at once, since it took Dorcas nearly all the time to answer the door-bell. She had found Mrs. Harley apparently willing to go in her kitchen a little while every morning; still, she noticed that her appearance was dejected and unhappy. She mentioned it to her nephew, but he concluded it was only because she felt her incompetency, and was satisfied it would soon wear off. Going suddenly in the room one morning, Aunt Ruth found Mrs. Harley in tears. She was arranging her little boy's hair, and evidently trying to conceal some hidden grief. With characteristic kindness, Aunt Ruth begged her to confide to her her troubles. “I am afraid,” said she, “you are not pleased with the part I have taken in your house: perhaps you think I have been too officious, or that I impose too much upon you?” “Oh no, it is nothing of that kind,” exclaimed Mrs. Harley, earnestly. “To tell you the simple truth, aunt, I am mortified to death about that party I gave. There are so many unpleasant things which conspire to vex me, and it is so provoking, too, after one has exhausted so much time, and spent so much money, to find we derive so little real enjoyment from it. Do tell me, were you ever so treated?” “No, my dear, not exactly. I never gave such kind of parties. We used to meet socially to drink tea when I was keeping house for myself, but in those days we seldom gave splendid entertainments; our incomes would not admit of it. It was a maxim of my husband's, that “slow gains must be slowly spent:” but I really think we enjoyed a great deal more in those times, when we went visiting early, and returned by nine in the evening. I never heard such remarks then as I do now. Every one knew their friends, and felt confidence in them. But come, Mary, cheer up; if this is all that troubles you, I see no occasion for tears; besides, it is all over now, and if you have done wrong once, try and do better next time.” “But, aunt, I begin to feel that there is no pleasure in the kind of life I lead.” What an honest confession! There is no pleasure in empty ceremony, formal parade, and idle display! How often would this cry be echoed from the hearts of the merely fashionable, if they would but declare their real sentiments!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L 2 CHAPTER XVI. PROGRESS IN REFORMS. Being thoroughly impressed with the conviction that it was but a heartless business to be the devotee of fashion, Mrs. Harley now turned her attention to the performance of duties; and although the task was sometimes hard, and occasionally a little wearisome, yet it was seldom she complained of the burden, feeling grateful for the kindness of her teacher. The calls were ended, and Mr. Harley's family experienced the comfortable, rational enjoyment which springs from a well-regulated home. Marianne entered willingly upon her duties; little Dorcas, taught by Aunt Ruth, had learned to know her place, and Mrs. Harley began to awake to the responsibilities which devolved upon her. Once enlightened, our path becomes clear, and the performance of one duty paves the way to the fulfilment of others. Little John, hitherto neglected and intrusted to the care of servants, began to lisp “naughty words,” besides showing a headstrong temper, which, having been once suffered to obtain the mastery, was found very difficult to subdue. Mr. Harley, feeling his own inefficiency, sought the aid he needed from treatises on family government, while his wife was busily employed in providing for his mere external wants. How true it is, that when once the wants and gratifications of the body become an all-absorbing theme, it requires almost superhuman energy to change the current of our thoughts and desires. Aunt Ruth, as I have before intimated, was actuated by principle in all her schemes for temporal advantage to her friends. As proof of it, she very mildly asked her nephew one evening, as they were gathered round the centre table, “If he did not think many useful admonitions and directions in family government might be gathered from the Bible?” The idea struck him strangely, and he very frankly answered that he had not read the Bible much since he was a boy; “For my father,” said he, “always made it a standing rule that I should read a chapter to him every morning, and it being then an irksome task, and a mere mechanical effort, I suppose an indifference was thus acquired, which I have not been able to conquer since; though,” added he, “I generally read a chapter or two on the Sabbath.” Then turning a significant look to his wife, “Mary reads the newspapers on Sunday.” Aunt Ruth inquired “if they generally attended church.” “We go,” replied Mr. Harley, “in the morning; then I take a turn in the news-room, and, after dinner, generally sleep a short time.” “Has Dorcas ever been to a Sunday-school?” asked Aunt Ruth. “Not since she has been with me,” said Mrs. Harley. “I believe she used to go, or be taught by her weekly teacher; for when she first came she used to say her prayers and some hymns before she went to sleep, Mrs. Hopkins said; but I rather think she was not much encouraged by her in any good thing.” “I think it a great responsibility to take charge of such a child as Dorcas,” observed Aunt Ruth. “If such children have good principles early instilled in their mind, it affords the best security for the faithful performance of their duties. Perhaps, William, you remember Ellen Read, who married a carpenter of the name of Mason. When she first came to live with me, she was as ill-tempered and unmanageable a child as you can conceive. She seemed to delight in deceit and mischief. I made it my business to cultivate all her good feelings. I read to her lessons on forbearance and forgiveness, and often expatiated on the golden rule; then I taught her little prayers, and finally succeeded in making her ashamed, as well as afraid, to do wrong. You cannot conceive what a change was wrought in her character in one year. This was before Sunday-schools were established: now you can have a great deal of assistance from these; but, after all, we must help sow the good seed, for we cannot expect the work to be begun and completed by others.” These and similar hints, often reiterated by their kind aunt with perfect good nature, led the way to more important changes, to which her conduct also contributed, for nothing renders goodness so attractive as the living example. As an evidence that these well-timed hints were not lost, rather late in the spring, when Aunt Ruth had gone home, an invitation to Mrs. Gerrish's was received by Mrs. Harley. She consulted with her husband about going. “For my part,” said she, “since I have fairly settled down to these family cares, and enjoyments too, I have lost nearly all my relish for parties. I was thoroughly cured by giving one.” “If that be the case,” replied her husband, “we may call it a pretty profitable party, after all. I am sure, if you have no wish to accept Mrs. Gerrish's invitation, neither have I: we shall only put ourselves under fresh obligations; but if we give up going to these large parties, of course no one will expect us to give one. We are much happier at home, I am sure.” “I begin to think so too, my dear,” said Mrs. Harley; “I have been vexed with myself a hundred times that I paid so much for that velvet dress, which was so soon ruined. If I went to Mrs. Gerrish's, I should, of course, be obliged to have a new one; and, since Aunt Ruth was here, somehow or other, I don't care much about such things, she impressed me so strongly with the folly of permitting them to engross my whole time.” “But what excuse shall we write?” asked Mr. Harley. “Not any, William. I will call and see Mrs. Gerrish, and explain it all to her: that we have adopted a new style of living, in consequence of finding that we cannot afford to give large parties, and so, of course, I shall not attend them; and, more than all, that I have lost my relish for them, in a great measure.” The next day Mrs. Harley told her husband that Mrs. Gerrish had replied tauntingly to her excuses, by saying, “She did not wonder at her choice, as Mrs. Harley had offended so many when she gave her party.” “So you see,” added Mrs. Harley, “these fashionable friends are worth just as much as Aunt Ruth said.” By steady but somewhat difficult steps in the commencement, Mrs. Harley proceeded in redeeming the past time; but never did a week go by that she did not find some relic of her former self which she had not shaken off. So closely do our follies cleave to us when one they have gained the mastery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. THE VISIT TO AUNT RUTH. At midsummer Mrs. Harley, with her little boy and Dorcas, made their promised visit to Aunt Ruth, leaving the faithful Marianne in charge of the house. Mr. Harley took this opportunity to go South. No pains were spared by the kind aunt to make this a profitable visit. We subjoin a letter which Mrs. Harley wrote to her husband, giving an account of it. “My dear William—Your earthly treasures (that is, little John and myself) are running wild in these Elysian fields. Escaped from the din and tumult of the ctiy, it is so reviving to breathe the pure air of this healthful region, that the principal part of my conversation is to tell all the kind people whom I see here how delighted I am with the change, and how happy they must be who enjoy it all the time; to which Aunt Ruth generally replies, `Those who make the change are the people who are alive to its benefits; while those who always live amid such beauty become indifferent spectators.' “By-the-by, William, what do you think I am doing? I am learning to make puddings, pastry, and bread! What I once thought such a drudgery now makes every day pass pleasantly. It would do you good to see what I am called to witness every day; such regularity and admirable system are enough to induce every one to inquire how they can be produced. There are but two servants, and there are, including ourselves, thirteen in the family; yet there does not seem to be more than they can easily perform. “We rise early (no morning naps are allowed here), and although it was rather difficult for me at first, yet, as Aunt Ruth prophesied, I do feel better for it now that I am accustomed to it. Good Mr. Brant has family prayers, at which we all assemble before we enter upon the duties of the day—then every one, knowing his own share of the work, goes about it cheerfully: we never hear any fretting, nor the odious exclamation, `That doesn't belong to me to do!' Our living is plain and simple, but the flavour of the food would seem delicious M to an epicure. I am giving up the idea that a receipt-book is as good as experience. “But I do very much regret that I did not acquire this knowledge a little earlier; how much trouble it would have saved us! I feel vexed with myself that I could be so indifferent; but, having never been taught, I was an easy dupe. “Everything here is turned to good account; for when there is anything we do not need, a worthy but poor family near us are the recipients of Aunt Ruth's bounty. Am I not in the right kind of school, William? What say you to permitting Marianne to visit her friends, and letting me remain here a month or so? Should you return in the mean time, you can come out morning and evening. “Our Sabbaths here are delightful. I attend church all day (no headaches now), and after our return Mr. Brant carries out the topic on which the minister preached in all its practical bearings. He is not a severe, exclusive man, but one whose religion is like a cheerful sunshine, irradiating all upon whom its rays fall. He has taken a great fancy to Johnny, which is fully reciprocated by the charming little fellow, who yet fears him as much as he loves him. He, too, is greatly improving under these influences. He can wait now when he is at the table, without crying for first attentions, as he formerly did. “Dorcas has become a real help. She is quick, respectful, and willing to do as she is bid; loves her Sunday-school teacher here very much, and, Aunt Ruth says, appears to be actuated by right principles. “I hope you will accede to the proposal I have made, and come here for a few days, to witness for yourself what I have so inadequately described. “Poor Mrs. Gerrish! You have heard or her husband's failure, I suppose? I hear they are going to break up housekeeping. What will her fashionable friends say? I am glad I am no longer one of the number, for I should be doomed to hear so many unkind remarks from those for whose approbation she expended so much time and money. Of course I shall call on her as soon as I return, and will endeavour now to prove myself a real friend. “My friend Emma is at the Springs for her health, and, it is said, intends to give a splendid party early in the season. With what little interest do I now hear such reports! I, who was the veriest slave of fashion, have learned to glory in my release from its vexatious and heartless customs; but, for fear lest I am not yet wholly emancipated from its bondage, I intend not to place myself in the way of temptation, by attending any of these grand entertainments. “Pray, William, do not make yourself ill by over-exertion. My heart is with you in tenderest affection till we meet again. “Yours devotedly, “Mary.” Mr. Harley, finding it for his advantage to go farther South, and thus prolong his absence, acceded gladly to his wife's request; adding, “The pleasant, healthful tone of her last letter, made him promise himself many days of domestic happiness.” But, that we are prone to flatter ourselves, and rejoice when on the verge of misfortune, Mrs. Harley's next letter gave ample evidence.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. CONCLUSION. “Dear Husband—When I last wrote, the full tide of happiness seemed flowing in upon me on every side; but alas! the change. Johnny, the day after I wrote you, was taken ill, and has continued so ever since. His disease the doctor pronounces to be the scarlet fever. To-day he is a little better; and while he is sleeping, I have taken my writing-desk to his bedside, that I may be ready to note any alteration. “As painful, William, as was our separation, and as much as I regret your absence (rendered tenfold more trying by our child's illness), I have reason to rejoice that I am here. Our ministering angel, your good aunt, has been my nurse, companion, and friend—in short, everything to me. All the family have been unwearied in their kindness and attention. “You know how unaccustomed I have been to sickness—how ready I always was to intrust the care of Johny, when an infant, to a nurse, M 2 that I might shine in the assembly or grace a party. Now I fear that my hour of retribution has come. How often, since our little darling has been so ill, have I prayed that such folly might be forgiven me. Of all sins, it now appears to me that those of a careless mother are the most reprehensible. Dorcas tells me the nurse used to give him stuff out of a vial to make him sleep when I was out late, and she brought me one of them, which she had been using as an ink-bottle, labelled Paregoric. Can I ever forgive myself such neglect? If his life is only spared, never will I be again so heedless. “We are uniting in devising means for his relief: sympathy is expressed by every member of the family; and such quietness reigns in the house, you would think it almost deserted, so cautiously do these well-trained domestics avoid the additional pain which noise produces. If we are all spared to meet again, shall I put in practice what I am so deeply charmed with here? “Our good minister has called: from the tenour of his remarks, I fear he thinks Johny will not recover. He seems better to me, but whether I am deceiving myself or not, time will determine. Amid all these proofs of sympathy, how much, William, I feel the need of yours?” Here the letter was suddenly broken off. In a day or two after, however, it was continued as follows: “Afternoon “Our child has now passed the crisis of his disease, and is pronounced out of danger. We can never repay the unwearied kindness of Aunt Ruth. Above all, let our gratitude ascend to the Preserver of our lives.” That the feelings thus excited by sickness and other subduing influences were never lost, we have proof in the altered character of Mrs. Harley when she resumed the charge of her own family. A new field opened before her, and she resolved to acquit herself in it with the true dignity belonging to the responsible station of mistress of a family. She commenced upon the only sure plan to ensure its continuance, and that was, by adopting firm, steady, and unwavering principle for the guide of all her actions. She now, prompted by pleasure as well as duty, gave all necessary attention to her affairs, and succeeded so well, simply with the assistance of Dorcas and Marianne, that Mr. Harley said his expenses would not exceed his income, including in his estimate the cost of the party and of their wardrobe. And it was acknowledged, even by her fashionable friends, that Mrs. Harley dressed with elegant simplicity. They became quite celebrated, too, for their delightful little parties, which were characterized by liberality without useless profusion. It is not to be supposed that Mrs. Harley dropped all her fashionable friends, but those only who showed no wish to continue the acquaintance on her present plan of life. She retained all those whose opinion was worth regarding, and they rejoiced to find her improving; for, though she had laid aside the gaudy trappings which had sometimes adorned her person, and made her appear superficial, she developed those mental and moral graces which give a charm to conversation, and all who pretended to any literary acquirements felt her new charms attract them more powerfully. Of her own experience since the change, her last letter to Aunt Ruth will give us the particulars. “Dear Aunt—You very good-naturedly ask me how I like the change from my former mode of living. I will frankly tell you, that it scarcely admits a comparison. I blush to recall my former imbecility, and often wonder at the long suffering of my friends, and of William in particular—that he should chide so little when he felt so much! “I believe I never told you to what cause I attributed the superficial mode of thinking I once indulged. When I first entered the world, or `came out,' as the phrase is, I was too much flattered. I was literally surfeited by the praise of my charms. These I magnified and dwelt upon until I was weak enough to believe them all-sufficient. “When not attending parties, I compensated for the loss of that kind of excitement by reading novels. Viewing life through this false mirror, I became disgusted with the real, except when it accorded with my disordered, dreamy imagination; and when I was married, I resolved that no domestic ties should sever me from my favourite amusements. “My kitchen was of course beneath my notice, provided my wants could be supplied; the improvidence of the servants did not disturb me at all, my main object being to move in the fashionable world. And yet that life now appears to me, as I reflect upon it, the most unenviable. I was continually tormenting myself about trifles. If a house was furnished more fashionably than my own, if my acquaintances were more richly dressed, I would worry myself and William about it till I obtained his consent to similar extravagance. This made me a restless, unhappy being; for who that becomes such a slave does not see something to covet which another possesses? “Just before your timely visit, you remember, I gave my long-talked-of party, the unhappy effects of which I feel to this day; for, in my desire to include new friends, I forgot the rules of true politeness, and excluded some old ones, whose forfeited friendship I shall ever regret. “At that time you came. How I received you, you well know. Escaped from the prodigality of the housekeeper, and vexed with domestics who repaid my want of interest in them by feeling none for me, it appeared to me that you had stepped in to be a witness against me to my already irritated husband. How I misjudged you! You seem to me now to have been `an angel sent on an errand of mercy,' an instrument to enlighten me, and, I trust, save me. “Now I look upon the past as time wasted and misused, and feel that I have need to redouble my diligence to atone in part for manifold defects. My duties are now my pleasures. The responsibilities of a wife and mother are viewed, I trust, as a Christian should regard them. “I have laid aside my novels, and give my leisure to those more profitable books which enlighten the understanding and improve the heart. I devote to my child and my husband those evenings I once frittered away in the gay assembly, and william bids me add that, as you made your first visit when we were only `Keeping House,' he desires you to come and find us `House Keeping.' “Your affectionate niece, “Marry Harley.” THE END.</field>
