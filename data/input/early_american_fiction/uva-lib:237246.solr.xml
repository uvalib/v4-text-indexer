      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. THE YOUNG COLONIST. THE soft, roseate haze of an autumnal sunset was just deepening into the obscurity of twilight, as a young man came forth from the door of a humble dwelling that stood in a narrow court not far from Cornhill. The air was mild, and not a breath moved the scarlet leaves of the maple that overshadowed the lowly roof of the house. There was a little yard in front between the step and the court, which was ornamented by a few shrubs and plants, and by each side of the door stoop were three or four pots of geraniums and rose-trees. These were green and fragrant, and the former were in flower, thus betraying careful nurture, while all else in the yard was feeling the first touch of autumn. The two round plats of closely shaven grass, not larger than a chaise wheel, with the circular paths around them, were strewn and filled with dead leaves, which rustled to the tread of the youth, as he passed with a quick step from the door to the latticed gate. He wore a broad-brimmed straw hat, and a light brown frock-coat buttoned to his chin, displaying the fine development of his manly chest. He was of good height and finely shaped, with a certain air of nobleness in his carriage and step, that outward expression of the figure which indicates a frank, generous and bold spirit within. His age was about four-and-twenty. The shadow cast by his hat over his features did not bring their outline into view with sufficient distinctness to judge accurately of their character. They seemed, nevertheless, to be handsome, and lighted up by a finely brilliant eye beneath a dark brow, which was something flushed, as if with some recent excitement. He carried beneath his arm a stout stick, as if it were a constant out-door companion. He had closed the door behind him as he came out, but as he laid his hand upon the little gate, which was but twelve or fourteen feet separated from it, the door was re-opened by a young girl, who, looking after him with an earnest expression upon her lovely features, called in a low tone, “Fleming!” “Mary!” he answered, in a kind manner, removing his hand from the gate, and turning back to the door-step upon which she stood. “You will not be gone long, will you?” she asked, laying her hand in his. “Come home before nine.” “I will be at home as soon as I can, sister. But you must not be alarmed if I should be out after the bell rings.” “I do not fear for myself, as we shall not be, probably, disturbed to-night again to billet the soldiers, but it is for you. You are so quick and impetuous, and your act in expelling the soldiers from the house will bring the vengeance of the dreadful lieutenant-governor upon you.” “I do not fear him nor his tools, Mary. It is probable that he may send here to arrest me. You will obey me by having the bar placed across the door, and by keeping the windows closed. I will send Saul round at once. As soon as you let him in, keep all close till I come back. The soldiers will not dare to break in! Every man in Boston would make the cause his own! Keep courage! I shall see the governor before any order is issued, and it is for this I am hastening. I will face him in person, and represent the matter before him in a fearless and independent manner. I do not fear the tyrant Hutchinson, Mary. Do not fear for me. I shall return to you soon, and assure you of our future security. I would not leave you at this crisis; but by going without delay to the governor, I may prevent the evil you fear.” “Be respectful before him, I again entreat you, Fleming,” said the young girl, looking up into his face with her deep-blue eyes, expressing mingled admiration, love and timid apprehension. “I shall speak before him as a man, and one of the true born sons of liberty!” answered Fleming, with firmness. “Now, good bye! Remember, as soon as Saul comes, to keep the doors fast. He will be a host in himself, poor soul as he is, for he is brave, faithful, and a lion in strength. Keep heart, Mary. All will yet go better than you mistrust. I do not regret what I have done!” With these words he kissed her with fraternal tenderness, and releasing his two hands from the clasp of hers, he hurried out of the gate, and disappeared down the Court in the direction of Cornhill. The maiden listened until his footsteps could no longer be heard by her, and then folding her hands together, she looked up to the azure skies, where, here and there, a far, faint star had began to kindle its altar-fire, and fervently addressed a prayer for the safety of her brother in his present hour of peril. She was scarcely past seventeen, a sweet, gentle girl, with eyes that seemed to have stolen their color from the heavens, towards which they were up-turned. Her soft brown hair was combed back from her pure brow, and fell upon her neck in shining tresses. Her features were delicately moulded, and almost angelic in their expression of goodness and truthfulness. Her lips were like those of a young child, red and ripely full, and pouting with beauty and love. Her form was slight and fairy-like, and expressive with the spiritual embodiment of every womanly grace. While she still stood in the door, and again was listening, for she detected fresh footsteps coming up the court, each foot-fall heavier and louder, a man approached and opened the gate. His appearance was singular and striking. In height he was full six feet and eight inches, huge in the breadth of shoulder, and heavily massive in all his proportions. He was a veritable giant. He wore a blue woollen cap, with a red tassel dangling behind, a gay jacket of Scotch plaid, yellow breeches, and scarlet hose. In his hand he carried a huge cricket-bat, spoon-shaped, at the extremity and from one of his side pockets projected an enormous leathern ball, the size of a foot-ball. “Oh, Saul, I am so glad you have come,” said Mary Field, in a tone of pleasure. “I was afraid Fleming wouldn't find you!” “Brother Flemmy, Menny, al'ays knows where to find brothey Saul,” answered the giant, in a voice like that of an awkward boy just at that peculiar crisis when his voice is changing from juvenility to manhood. His face, too, though the features were large and suited to his size, was like that of a boy of eighteen, though his age could not have been less than twenty-six or seven. The general expression of his countenance was kindly, although his restless grey eyes indicated a temperament that it would be as fearful to rouse as to stir to anger the unbound lion. “You must come in, Saul, and bar the door,” said the maiden, in the manner of one who gently rules. “I don't want to be in the house a bit, Menny. The stars be comin' out, and I and the stars have pleasant times togethy, when I am sittin' a thinkin' on the round hill on the commy!” “You shall go on the common to-morrow night, Saul. Come in now and bar the door. The soldiers have been here, and I fear they may come again!” “Did they say anything wicked to you, Menny?” asked Saul, quickly. “No, Saul. But come in. You must be my guard!” “That I will, Menny,” answered the giant, taking her cheeks affectionately between his finger and thumb, as one would an infant's. “If I had been home, an' the sogies had come to harm you, Menny, I'd ha' killed 'em! I wouldn't mind knockin' 'em on the head no more than I would my ball!” As he spoke, he grasped his bat like a quarter-staff, and gave it a flourish around his head that made the wind rush again. He then stooped, bending nearly double, and entered the house. Mary closed the door after him, and then was heard the sound of an iron bar falling heavily across it into its bed; for these were times when barred doors were the only safeguard against the insolence of the British soldiers who were then quartered in Boston. At the time of our story the popular mind was in a violent state of agitation from the tyrannical spirit manifested by the English ministry, at the head of which was Grenville. The American colonists had exposed themselves to unparalleled dangers and hardships to lay the foundation of an empire where liberty of conscience might prevail. Civil liberty is the offspring of religious. Religious freedom is political freedom. The colonists early learned to know the value of liberty. They early began to cherish it next to their religious faith, out of which it grew, and which was the soil in which it was nourished. They therefore looked with careful eye and ever watchful suspicion upon the measures of the mother country in reference to them. They could not but be otherwise than jealous of the legislative acts of a power which they knew loved them not for flying from its abuses and persecuting power. In the relation which they held as a colony, however, they had willingly submitted to taxation for the purpose of sustaining the wars waged against the Indians and the French. But when these wars were ended, the necessity for taxation ceased, as the colonists had within themselves resources sufficient for their own existence. When, therefore, the ministry in the mother country proposed not only to continue the tax as heretofore, on the plea that the revenue was needed to defray the expenses of defending, securing and protecting the colony, but also resolved to levy duties by the infamous “Stamp Act,” the colonists beheld in this procedure despotism, usurpation and tyranny of the most bare-faced character. They saw that England was jealous of their flourishing commerce, and that led by her sateless avarice, and her imperious desire of power and dominion, had resolved both to profit by it and at the same time to restrain it. They saw that so far from being satisfied with engrossing all the commerce of the colonies by heavy duties that amounted to prohibition on all goods imported into them from places not subject to her rule, she sought to make them the slaves of her lust of riches, and to turn into her own coffers the wealth of colonial commerce. When the report, that a bill to levy a stamp-duty on every written or printed paper drawn up or issued for any legal or business purpose in the colonies, had been passed by parliament and signed by the king, reached the shores of New England, the excitement through all classes was indescribable. The principles of despotism were unfolded at one view in the despotic bill, and the flame of resistance to this act of oppression and tyrannical power spread from one end of the land to the other. The news had reached Boston the morning of the day upon which our story opens. The excitement throughout the town was great. Men left their several pursuits and places of business to assemble in crowds at the coffee-houses, custom-house, court-hall, and other public places, to talk over the matter and strengthen each other's purpose to resist this aggressive act. The lieutenant-governor, the notorious Hutchinson, witnessing the popular agitation, and becoming alarmed, sent over to the castle for troops, which he stationed at different quarters of the town, some in King-street, near the State-house, others in Cornhill, others in the square west of Fanueil Hall; for he apprehended, such was his plea, some outbreak of the stern passions of the people. As night approached, the citizens mostly retired to their houses peaceably, and Hutchinson sent detachments of his soldiers to be quartered in the private houses of the townsmen until the next day, there having been neither barracks nor provision provided for them. Some of the more forbearing citizens received the soldiers, fearing to resist the authority of a man so despotic and vindictive, knowing that it would be only for one night, while others more resolute closed their doors against them. The soldiers passed such quietly, having orders to use no violence, but to report all who shut them out. A small detachment seeking quarters had marched up the court in which Fleming with his mother and sister lived, and having drawn up before the gate, a young officer knocked at the door, demanding admittance. Fleming was at tea, and leaving the table with an angry face, for he had seen what kind of guests they were through the trellised foliage of the window, he opened the door. He knew the young lieutenant well, and the recognition did not smooth his temper at the prospect of having twelve huzzars quartered in his home for a night, and perhaps longer. He had heard already of the order of the governor, and his sense of justice had caused his spirit to kindle at the gross outrage put upon the town. He had not yet heard, however, that any one had resisted it. “What do you wish, sir?” he demanded, in as quiet a tone as he could assume towards the officer, an imperious young man, who had once, on a Sabbath day, followed his sister Mary from church to the house, and insisted on entering with her, when Saul met him face to face in the entry, and hurled him nearly over the gate. Saul had afterwards pointed out the young officer to his brother, and although Fleming had never spoken to him, he had marked him. “I intend to quarter here with twelve men, the last left unprovided for of the detachment I command,” answered the officer. “Sergeant,” he added, turning round, “fall into file and march in!” “My house is small—I cannot accommodate you, sir,” answered Fleming, firmly, as he placed his person in the door-way. “I have orders from the lieutenant-governor, young man,” answered the officer, with a pale and angry lip. “I shall obey it! March forward, men!” “You cross this threshold at your peril!” cried Fleming. “I have not the strength of my brother, to hurl you into the court, but I have a spirit that will resist oppression. My house is my castle! You enter it at your peril!” Fleming stood before the English officer with a look of that terrible calmness which awes. His arms were folded upon his chest. He held in his hands no weapon. The officer gazed for an instant upon him with an air of indecision, his eyes lighted up with fierce resentment. He turned his head twice, as if to give orders to his men to rush upon the daring young colonist, but at length, as if he feared the consequences to himself, for he saw that he would be the first victim of such an attempt, he replied, “Very well, young man! I forbear to give orders to my men to cut you down, as you deserve, for this audacity to a British officer— this defiance of the governor's authority. I will leave your punishment in his hands; and when you find yourself in prison,” he added, in a malicious tone of triumph, “you may console yourself that I am dallying here with your lovely little sister!” Fleming would have sprung upon him and hurled him to the ground, if, anticipating the effect of his words, he had not retreated quickly, and placed the gate between them. Fleming would still have gone after him, but Mary laid her hand upon his arm. “Brother!” she said, in a low, sweet voice of expostulation that he ever listened to in the most angry moment. “Mary?” “Let him go! Do not take any rash step! You have not yet raised your arm against them, and it is best it is so!” “Go in, Mary! He lingers to gaze upon you!” “Farewell, pretty one!” cried the English huzzar officer, and he touched two fingers to his lips, and waved them with an air of gallantry towards her. “By-and-bye we shall be better friends, my fair puritan!” It was with difficulty Fleming could restrain the impulse to bound forth upon the insulter, and punish him, in the face of his soldiers, for his insolence; but the mild voice of his sister held him back. “Fleming, do not bring his vengeance upon you. For your sake —for my sake, endure!” “I will let him pass for the present,” answered the indignant young colonist, as the officer, whose name was Cleverling, and who was the younger son of a British nobleman, walked menacingly down the court, followed by his soldiers. Fleming re-entered the house, and was persuaded to resume his seat at the tea-table; but his feelings were too much agitated to enable him to finish the meal. After a few minutes he rose from his chair and took down his hat. “Fleming, you will not go out, now that you are so much excited, and while danger menaces you from this incensed officer. Remain, dear brother, within, and think no more of what has passed. Whatever you do will only fan the flame!” “Mary, you know not what you say! If I bear tamely this outrage—if every man bears it without a word, we are made slaves. Hutchinson shall know that he must not place his foot upon the necks of free-born men. If he imagines we are like the degraded English peasants at home, he will soon find the difference!” “But what can you do, Fleming? You are a young man, scarcely known, and perhaps stand alone in the refusal to admit the soldiers into your house. If resistance is to be made to this tyranny and despotism of the governor, it should begin with the rulers of the town—with the rich and influential!” “All fires that are lighted begin to burn from the ground upward, Mary,” answered the young, colonist, moodily. “But I am not the only one. I know that there are a thousand as free-beating hearts in Boston as my own. I have witnessed this day a spirit pervading men's bosoms that makes me feel proud that I am a colonist!” “I have heard that the town's-people have said bold words to-day, since the news came that the stamp-act bill is passed,” said his mother, a tall, dark-eyed, intelligent woman, with a face expressive of that firmness and nerve which singularly characterised the matrons of that day. “If you had seen and heard what I have borne witness to, you would have gloried in a land that contained such noble spirits as have this day manifested themselves throughout the streets. There seemed but one heart and one mind, mother! From the shoemaker to the judge in his gown, but one sentiment prevailed, and this was a resolute purpose to resist this aggressive act of the tyrants over sea! It was for fear that it would take head and bear down his authority, that the cowardly Hutehinson sent for troops from the castle—these very troops which he would now quarter upon us. It would seem as if he would feel the pulse of our forbearance, and guage to the depth our slavish submission. For one, I thank God that I have resisted his power!” “I fear some dreadful evil will befall you and ourselves, my son, from the governor's resentment,” said his mother, with looks of anxious solicitude, “when what you have done shall be reported to his ears with all the exaggerations of malice. I would advise you to absent yourself from the town for a few days, Fleming, until the matter is a little blown over. If you remain here you will be arrested.” “I do not fear it,” answered Fleming, boldly. “But I fear it, brother,” said Mary Field, with anxiety. “Do as our mother advises. Go this night, this hour, to Cambridge, to your grandfather's, and there stay until I let you know that you can safely return.” “And leave my dove-cote to the mercy of the hawk! No, Mary. I will at once to the presence of the governor. I will forestall the news of what I have done, by telling it myself. I will speak to the governor as a man to a man. I do not fear him. My eye will not quail before his eye, nor my voice falter at the sound of his own. Do not say a word. I am resolved! It is the only course for your safety, and for my own. Do not fear for me. I feel that I shall be sustained by every true heart in the town. It will bring out and show to the friends of liberty who are men!” As he spoke, he placed his hat upon his head, buttoned his outercoat closely over his chest, grasped his walking-staff, and prepared to go forth. “Brother, promise me that you will be discreet, if you still will go to the governor,” said his sister, laying her hand upon his arm. “I will be so. I shall say nothing unbecoming myself or my birth as a free colonist. Now do not follow me out. God bless you both! I will ere long return with good news to you. I will first find Saul, and send him hither.” With these words he left the room and the house; but, as he was passing through the little gate, was recalled by his sister to the door, as already related in the former portion of this chapter. Mary Field was a firm and courageous girl. She was fondly attached to her brother, but not with weakness. She thought with him and like him, in reference to the subject of their conversation, and approved of his going to the governor in advance of the officer, though she strove to temper his fiery spirit with the calmer influences of her own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE TWO PATRIOTS. FLEMING passed out of the court and entered Cornhill, then one of the principal streets of the old town of Boston. The darkness of night had not yet set in, and objects and persons near could be seen and recognized with ease. He passed southward in the direction of the old State House, near which he observed a group gathered. As he came near and thrust himself forward among the people, some fifty or sixty in number, who stood silently gazing upon some object, he discovered that it was a piece of artillery with the muzzle pointed at the windows of the Town Hall, opposite which was lighted up. Around the gun were stationed four or five soldiers. While he was looking at it and was about to ask a citizen what it meant, a loud cry was raised from the north outlet of King street. “Clear the way all! Stand back men!” The call was echoed sternly by the soldiers about the gun, who, at the same time, with their sheathed sabres began to drive back the citizens. Fleming extricated himself from the rushing mass, and looking down King street where he heard the heavy rumble of wheels and the tramp of feet, and beheld advancing a second piece of ordinance drawn by horses, followed by soldiers, and attended by two officers on horseback. He stepped back to let the whole pass. The gun was trundled round into Cornhill and wheeled into its place abreast of the other. The horses were unharnessed and driven off, while the soldiers who had accompanied the piece, prepared to load it. The two officers sat looking on in their saddles in the space left by the citizens; while the latter remained aloof, gazing upon the scene with mingled emotions of fear, surprise and indignation. The latter feeling alone had place in Fleming's bosom. “What means this outrage?” he asked of a man who had resisted the soldiers, and only retired after having wrested from them and broken one of their sheathed sabres. “It means, that we in Boston are fast becoming slaves to the King of England. The passage of the Stamp Act has emboldened Hutchinson, and you see what he does! The act is nothing more nor less than a law and command for him and all others in power in the colonies, to bind us and make bondsmen of us.” “Give me your hand, William Lee. Your heart and mine beat to the same measure.” William Lee grasped the outstretched hand of Fleming. The act and words were noticed by those who pressed near. “I am glad to see that the young men feel what they ought to, as well as we who are older,” said a man with grey locks. “It is time the colonies all took the alarm.” “And they will take it, mark me, friends and townsmen,” answered William Lee, a strong, stout ship-wright, in an energetic voice. “The express rider that went to-day with the news to York and Virginia, will leave fire in his path.” “What means these two cannon posted here, William?” asked Fleming, who was watching the soldiers as they were loading and levelling it. “It means that the general court shall not do any thing that Hutchinson don't like,” answered the ship-wright. “These cannon are placed here to overawe our colonial authorities. The court are to sit under the mouths of the king's cannon.” “Let us drag them into the dock!” cried a voice from the crowd. “Patience, friend. All in good time. This is but the beginning. Let us not be too precipitate. The nut is not yet ripe for the cracking.” This was spoken by Fleming in a low but impressive tone. “Yes, all in good time, as Fleming Field says,” answered William Lee, the ship-wright. “You see, Fleming, that the town-hall is lighted to-night. There is to be a meeting of the general court and of such of the townsfolk as choose to attend, to deliberate upon the course best to be pursued when the stamped paper arrives. The governor has ordered up the cannon to keep them from speaking too freely.” “And yet,” answered Fleming, “there is no man in that assembly who will withhold the free expression of his sentiments, were the whole British force to surround the hall, aye, stand within it. I have seen bold brows and heard the echo of brave hearts to-day.” “So have I, young man,” responded Lee. “Do you know that there has been full fifty doors barred against the soldiers that Hutchinson would have quartered upon their hearth-stones.” “I am glad of that!” cried Fleming, with animation. “I knew we were not all slaves in Boston. I also was honored by a detachment of a dozen huzzars, with young Captain Cleverling at their head.” “You!—why should so gay a gallant pass the rich man's portico to disturb you in your humble home?” “I asked not his motives,” responded Fleming, with a cheek heightened by the quick blood; “but I did not let him enter. He left without crossing my threshold, though none but a free man with a fearless heart and strong arm stood upon it.” “Bravo!” cried Lee. The word was echoed by the crowd; and Fleming recollecting his mission to the governor, withdrew from the throng, and passing with a proud step and an air of calm defiance, in front of the cannon, and so close to the soldiers as to brush against them, walked rapidly up the street. He had not gone but a few steps, when Lee overtook him, and laid his hand on his arm. “Fleming, where do you go? You and I must know each other better. We are one in this matter.” “I shall be glad to act with you for the good of the country, William Lee. I foresee that something will come of this besides mere passive resistance.” “Yes. The people are up. The colonies will not consent to this usurpation, believe me. You have seen what spirit was brought out to-day. Every man speaks his indignation openly. The news is flying south and it will thrill every true bosom. Great events will follow this madness of the ministry. When we heard a few weeks ago that such a bill was to be brought before parliament, not one sensible man ever thought it would pass. We worked idly upon the issue, therefore. But to-day has opened our eyes. We see the cloven-hoof, Fleming, and we must be watchful. This is only a grand scheme to make us a colony of serfs.” “I see that it is so! I am young and not so well skilled in politics as you are, William, but I can read what is written so plainly upon the wall. I can translate for George of England the hand-writing; and it is like that of God's to Belshazzar—`Thy kingdom is finished!' ” “Bold, but I do believe true words, young man. But whither do you walk so fast? Shall I go with you?” “I will let you, though I intended to go alone. I am going to ask an audience of the lieutenant-governor.” “Of Hutchinson?” asked Lee, with surprise, and half checking his steps, for they had been walking on side by side while talking. “Yes!” “For what end. Do you know him?” “I have seen him, and I know his character, William.” “He will not speak to you. What can you have to ask of him?” “Come with me and you shall hear in his presence. I have no time to explain now.” “Well, I will go with you. I see you have some determined purpose on your mind. If evil come to you, or wrong has already been done you, in me you will find a friend.” “I thank you. I need no friend that my country needs not. He who serves her serves me. He who is my friend is hers!” “You speak the very thoughts of my own heart, Fleming Field. Ah, who is that who passed and spoke to you? I have seen him with the governor.” “It is a young gentleman, his secretary.” “He spoke kindly.” “He is my friend, I believe.” “Trust none of them, Fleming.” “I think he is honorable.” “He may be. I bluntly tell you, I have no faith in any English born, especially those of blood.” “He is not high-born. He is as humble in birth as myself.” “Then I like him the better. But it is strange the proud, highborn Hutchinson should have in his house, and so near to his person, one of lowly origin.” “There is a story touching his birth and life that I will tell you sometime if you ask me, which will explain this. But here we are near the guard-house of the governor's mansion!” “I see the sentries are doubled, and that a detachment of his bodyguard stand under arms by the gate. You see the coward trembles. He will not admit you.” “He will!” answered Fleming, firmly. “You are a very determined young man. I can take lessons of you, and better men than I. But these soldiers are under marching orders. They are tramping this way. Suppose we stand aside and let them pass on.” “Not for British soldiers, Lee. We must let them see we do not fear them. They will grow insolent now, that by the news of today they see how the king regards us, and we must hold ourselves firmly as men and free citizens.” “Your words are as full of wisdom, young man, as your heart of courage. We will not stand off into the street. We will give them full space, and stand our ground.” They stood still by a post, awaiting the passage of a column of about thirty men. As they came near the officer in command, who had been detained in the rear after it had left the door of the guard-house, advanced to its head. It was light enough for Fleming to recognise his enemy, Cleverling. He at once understood that he was marching to arrest him in his house, with an order from the governor. His first impulse was to step boldly forward and confront him. But he trembled for the fate of Mary, unprotected and exposed to his free admiration and bold presence, and pressing quickly the arm of William Lee, he said:— “Let us precede them at a quick pace, while I say three words to you.” They then walked rapidly back the way they had come, keeping about thirty paces ahead of the column which was advancing along the side-walk in column four abreast, at double quick time, and without music. “William, this party is doubtless sent to seize upon my person. Do not think I am escaping from fear. I have a favor to ask of you, and only wish to gain time.” “Speak, and it is done!” answered the shipwright, warmly. “The party that I ejected from my house, was commanded by the officer who commands this. At the time some words passed between us—I knew well his motive in seeking to billet himself there, lowly as our estate is. He has conceived a wicked passion for my sister Mary, whom he has already insulted by his notice, and passing by loftier roofs, he pounced upon mine. I knew the man and his motives, and I gave him the reception both merited.” Cleverling intrudes himself on the presence of Mary Field. “You did well. But go on!” “He left the door, and marched off with his men, breathing vengeance and the wrath of Hutchinson against me. For myself I cared not; I thought only of those dear to me. I resolved to”— “Let us move faster—as the officer is hastening. I would not have him know who you are! We are but two to thirty, here.” “I resolved to anticipate him, and see the governor in person, and represent to him the truth. Besides, I am inspired with a strong desire to speak a few plain words to this man's ears! Now, this party behind us are doubtless moving towards my little home. I wish you to hasten thither in advance, and stand in the gate, and tell them I am not there. I leave to you this trust. You will do it better than I.” “I shall, and will do it! But do not say anything rash to Hutchinson. But take my advice, and go not near the man. It will be putting your head into the lion's mouth.” “I do not fear him. Besides, it is but arrest there or at home, for I will not hide from him like a criminal.” “Nor should you!” “I have done nothing but what every brave man should have done. If I am put under arrest by him, I shall have for friends every patriot in Boston. My imprisonment will be a sifter, and show what is chaff and what is the wheat among us.” “You ought not to risk so much for this end.” “I do not for this end. I have higher motives. I do but speak of the results that would follow. And, William, should I be detained by the governor, I leave my little fold at home to your charge. Saul is faithful and brave where those he loves, as he does Mary, are in danger, but Saul is not proof against duplicity and art. I leave her to you.” “She is as safe as in a castle, Fleming. I have only to give the rallying cry, and four hundred stalwart hands, with stout weapons in them, will be at my side. So fear not for her. If you have a mind to see and talk with the governor, go! Your pretty sister shall be safely guarded from all harm, and if Hutchinson dare lay a finger on you to injure you, let him beware. His canon, nor his guns, would avail the cruel coward.” “We will part here—I up this street, you through that avenue. Good night! Remain at my house an hour after the bell rings nine, and I will be there.” “I hope so. If not, I shall see that you are looked up.” With these words the two friends separated at a corner of the street, in the dark shadow cast by the drooping branches of a tree that over-arched the walk. The officer, Cleverling, had evidently been hastening his steps to overtake the two men he had seen turn and precede him; but they walked so rapidly, that unless he had fairly run, he could not have come up with them. But as he had no suspicion who they were, he let them continue on; when at length he thought he recognised Fleming's voice, as for a moment he elevated it. He was about to call on the leading platoon of four men to rush forward with him to ascertain, when they parted at the corner; and when he came to it, neither were visible, nor could he hear a footfall to guide him. He then proceeded on his march in the direction of Fleming's abode, for thither was he destined, for the purpose, as the young colonist had suspected, of arresting him, and bringing him before the governor, who, infuriated by the numerous failures of his soldiers to get quarters, and the number of houses of the chief citizens closed against them, resolved to make an example of Field, whose case he regarded as the most aggravating of all; for Cleverling had not failed to report it with every coloring that malice could dictate. After the division passed on, Fleming let himself down from the tree into which he had drawn himself up after Lee left him, and took his way rapidly a second time towards the governor's residence. This was a spacious and very elegant mansion, separated from the street by a broad, ornamented court-yard, adorned by a fountain and several statues. It was approached by an imposing alley, paved with smooth flags, and bordered by shrubbery. On the left of the gate, which was arched and crowned with the royal crest, gilt, stood a small guard-house, capable of containing ten or a dozen soldiers. Before the gate always paced a sentry with a musket at his shoulder. As Fleming came up, he saw two walking alternately opposite ways, like sentries in a besieged camp; for Hutchinson's cowardly fears made him unusually vigilant. He had seen evinced that day, a spirit he hardly believed existed in the land. He had hitherto seen the people submissive and quiet, even under his vexatious rule; but the annoyances to which he subjected them were petty and local. They did not involve any great principle. The colonists were pacific and loved quiet, and so let his low acts of personal despotism pass without replication than irony, sneers, contempt, or pity, and always with more or less of detestation. But when a principle like that of civil liberty was moved, the people who had hitherto been indifferent to what could not be well mended, suddenly seemed to be new created. He found a lion beneath where he had lifted the lamb's skin. He was amazed; and not only amazed, but frightened. He drew around him soldiery, and planted cannon in the streets. He issued proclamations every half hour from his house, wherein he kept himself with double sentries for his protection; for he had had it whispered to his trembling ears, that men said that he had first suggested to Lord North in a letter, the infamous project of levying the stamp duty. When Fleming came to the guard-house, before the mansion he saw by the lights which shone from the illuminated windows, for the governor had candles placed in every window, to expose clearly every object in the court and street beyond the gate, he was challenged by the sentry. “Who comes?” “A citizen!” answered Fleming, approaching still. “Stand and give the countersign.” “We citizens are not apt to be made guardians of such military secrets, especially in time of war.” “In time of war, young fellow!” repeated a tall slender officer, who was just coming out. “What do your words mean? Who are at war?” “England with her colonies, I believe.” “How so? We are not yet, nor likely to be.” “Then why are our streets planted with her cannon, our halls of justice besieged, our homes intruded upon by her soldiery? Why does the king's governor hold himself in the house with defences about his person, as if in a leaguered castle? What can war do more than all this?” “I, faith, not much, that is the truth, young man,” responded the officer, laughing; and passing out of the gate, he mounted a horse held by an orderly, and galloped up the street. “That seems a good-natured officer. Who is it?” asked Fleming of the sentry. “It is Colonel Barry, of the sixty-fourth. But what do you wish?” “To see the governor. I have not the pass-word, but I have something to say to him of moment. You will oblige me by sending in to ask him if he will let me see him.” The pleasing manner in which Fleming spoke, caused the soldier to address himself to one of his comrades off duty, and send him in with the request. The man returned and reported that the governor could see no one of the town's people. “Take him this; and tell him the bearer waits,” said Fleming, giving the soldier a gold seal. The man hesitated; but the air of decision with which Fleming gave him the order, induced him to comply. In a few moments he came back and said, respectfully, “His excellency desires me to conduct you to him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR. FLEMING followed the orderly up the broad avenue of the front court, and entered the door of the mansion. A sentinel was also stationed there. In the hall several young officers were lounging and conversing, who stared at the colonist as he passed them, and went into the governor's room. It was a large apartment, richly furnished, and hung with paintings of the first masters. Elegant cases, filled with books, were between the windows, and in two of the corners were marble statues, from Grecian models. The room was lighted by a chandelier of wax candles. An air of wealth and luxury characterised the whole interior; for Hutchinson greatly loved display, and although he possessed few qualities to render him a popular governor to the colonists, he was a man of educated tastes, and of no inconsiderable intelligence and talent. “Here is the young townsman, your excellency,” said the orderly, as he opened the door and stood aside for Fleming to enter the room. The lieutenant-governor looked up, for he was seated at a table with books and papers before him, and after fixing his dark grey eye steadily upon the face of Fleming, he said, as the orderly retired, “You desire to see me. I had nearly forgotten you. What is it you wish?” “The privilege of saying a few words to your excellency,” answered Fleming in a firm but respectful tone. “I can hear them where you stand!” said the governor, with a quick suspicious air, as Fleming advanced a step or two. “You are near enough to me. Say what you wish, for you must be aware that time is valuable to me just now.” The governor spoke in the manner of one who would act with kindness; though still with an air of impatience, as if he would have liked it quite as well if his visitor had not intruded upon his presence. The suspicion conveyed in his nervous desire, that Fleming should not approach any nigher, was understood by the latter; and he smiled scornfully at that timidity which saw an assassin in every one who came near his person. “Your excellency,” said Fleming, with that free manly bearing which always characterised him, “I have sought an interview, not to ask you for any recompense for the light service I was so fortunate as to afford you and your daughter. It is true I used the seal you gave me, but it was only when my first application was unsuccessful. I come to claim no favor of you on the score of a service done, but to demand a right.” “Demand! This is bold language!” said the governor, his brow bending darkly. “I speak it with all respect, sir. I have sought you to ask of you that protection which it is your duty to extend to the humblest in the colony, and the humblest in the colony to claim as a sacred privilege from the governor.” “What is it you wish? How can I protect you?” asked the governor, looking with surprise upon the fearless countenance of the speaker. “Sir, I am a young artisan. I maintain a mother and sister by the labor of my vocation. We live in humble style, as becomes our fortunes. To-night a party of soldiers came to my quiet home, and with arms in their hands, demanded to be admitted. I knew that we were at war with no nation. I did not ask who was their king, or what their country. I knew none but a lawless party would make an attempt to cross a peaceful threshold, and so I thrust them forth. Did I well or ill, your excellency?” “Were not those British soldiers, young man?” “I have said I asked not their name or nation. If they were foreign soldiers, I did right in thrusting them forth. Were they British soldiers, I did no less; for by what right do British soldiers intrude upon our hearths. When English troops get to conduct like sacking enemies, and enter our houses, who shall condemn us if we meet them as foes, and bar our doors against them. This I have done, Governor Hutchinson; and I have come here to demand redress, if these men prove to be British troops, for the outrage they have put upon me, a free born subject of the king—your king, their king, and my king?” Gov. Hutchinson gazed upon the young man with looks of astonishment. He was confounded by the new position in which the outrage he had authorised, had been placed by the bold colonist. “Young man, if you have turned soldiers from your door, you well knew they were British troops!” he said sternly. “Then I demand, by what authority do British troops enter and desecrate my house, that altar, sacred to every man—I mean every man who has a freeman's heart beating in his bosom?” “Do you profess ignorance of my order, issued this day.” “What order?” “That the citizens should for one night quarter the soldiers, give them food and lodgings.” “And by what authority did you issue this order? Who gave your excellency power to invade the sanctity of our dwellings! to send your lawless hirelings into our homes, to insult and riot, and pollute? Sir, you were placed in your high seat to govern and protect, not to tyrannise and destroy. You have no right to cross the lowliest threshold in the colony in person, without permission of the owner and master, much less have you authority to send armed soldiery. I have resisted your despotic order, and I am ready to bide the issue.” “Do you defy me, young man! Do you know that you are in my power,—that I can send you home to England as a traitor?” “I have weighed well the consequences. I have acted from a principle that had its birth in heaven—love of liberty.” “By the king's head! I should not be surprised if you were the very person that Cleverling has gone to arrest. Was Lieutenant Cleverling at the head of the party you refused admittance to your house, sirrah?” “He was, your excellency.” “He reported to me your conduct, but did not give your name. I gave him orders to bring you before me.” “I have anticipated his intention, your excellency. I knew that he would endeavor to get my arrest effected, and I therefore came to see you in person. On my way hither, I met him and his party. I have voluntarily placed myself in your power.” “What an extraordinary young man!” “Courage and patriotic virtue are, I doubt not, wonderful in the eyes of those who do not possess them. But I came not hither to insult your excellency.” “It is well for you to say this now,” responded Hutchinson, pale with rage, but yet looking upon him with a respect that he could not throw off. “Do you not fear me, that you have placed yourself in my power?” “No, sir. I have come as your friend, Governor Hutchinson. I know that among the towns-people, there is not one that will tell you frankly the truth. I have come to save you from yourself.” “Explain! What do you mean? What new danger menaces me?” asked the governor, with lively suspicion. “You have seen, sir, the exhibition of feeling which the news of to-day has produced! You have witnessed a firm purpose of resistance to the oppressive Stamp Bill. All parties have alike to-day, in the streets, in their shops, in the coffee-houses, on the wharves, in every place of public resort, expressed in words not to be mistaken, and the echo of which will yet reverberate through the halls of Parliament, their indignation at the passage of the bill, and their resolute determination to resist its enforcement. There is not a man so weak and ignorant, who does not see in it the links of the chain that Britain intends to cast upon our necks. They see in it her purpose to weigh us down to the earth by taxes, as she has done her own groaning population.” “I do not wish to hear such language, young man. You presume too much upon the favor you once chanced to afford me, to speak thus boldly.” “No, your excellency. I should speak as freely, had I never been so fortunate as to save you and your lovely daughter from sudden death, by drowning. I think not of this while I speak! I have come hither as your friend. I wish you to know the strong feeling that is aroused among men. I wish you to forbear increasing it by any acts of your own. At once withdraw the troops from the city, and send back to the castle the artillery that is planted in front of the State-house. Keep no guard, beyond one of mere honor, about your person, and take no active steps with reference to this infamous Stamp Act, until the order to do so arrives from the king. By this means you will conciliate the people, additionally outraged by the presence of the soldiery in the streets and in their houses, and you will avert from your own person a fearful doom. There, is, your excellency, a time when long suffering ceases to be a virtue. The people have hitherto borne much from you. They are in a mood to bear but very little more. If you would secure your own personal safety, and restore quiet in the town, you will send back the troops without delay, and appear openly before the people without a guard. This confidence in them will disarm their resentment, and cause them to visit their indignation upon the ministry at home alone, in petitions and remonstrances, instead of adding to them vengeance upon your own person as their tool.” The governor listened to the words of the young colonist with deep attention, now his cheek kindling with anger, now paling with fear. He rose and took two or three turns across the room, in troubled thought. At length he turned, and said to Fleming, “What motive has influenced you to come to me?” “A desire to prevent a hostile conflict between the town and troops, and partly from that feeling which leads us to serve those for whom once we have done a service!” “It may be so, it may be so,” he answered, thoughtfully, and regarding him with a look of scrutinizing suspicion; “but, young man, I dare not trust to your advice. I have no doubt all you say is truth, touching the danger that menaces me; and at the worst I can retire to the castle and defend myself!” “True; but is there any necessity of bringing affairs to such a crisis, your excellency? One musket fired, one drop of blood drawn in such a position of things, and, believe me, England would lose her colonies!” “Do you mean to say that you would take up arms to resist her authority?” asked the governor, contemptuously. “Yes, your excellency. Every coersive act on your part will hasten this posture of affairs. If you are a friend to the king, you will show yourself a friend to the colonies!” “You are a wonderful young man. I know not what to make of you. You seem as honest as you are bold. But you will not think it unnatural if I suspect your sincerity, and believe that you are sent to me by some of the leading colonists, who wish to have me remove the troops in order to take the town into their own keeping, and doubtless imprison me in my own house!” Fleming glanced at the lieutenant-governor's face to see if it did not manifest a blush of shame at this open expression of cowardly apprehension; but fear was a natural attribute of his excellency, and his cheek retained its pale hue. Fleming was not a little indignant at this suspicion, and was about to make some reply in character with his emotions, when a young female entered from a half-open door, and approached them. At the sight of her, the young colonist's brow was heightened with a crimson blush of pleasure and embarrassment. He dropped his eyes before the power of her beauty and presence, and bowed with confusion. The governor did not observe him, as the light fall of her footstep had caused him to turn his head. “Ah, Lucy, you are impatient for me to join you at the tea-board,” he said, smiling upon her, and expressing, in tone and look, a tenderness for her that at once covered, in Fleming's eyes, all his faults of character. “This young person you have seen before,” he added, pointing to Fleming. “Yes, and I am glad to see that he has not forgotten to call and see those who owe to him so much,” said Lucy Hutchinson, with grace and kindliness of speech and manner; and walking forward to where Fleming stood, she extended her hand to him, and said, with a blush, as she dropped her eyes before his adoring gaze—“I now thank you for your service to me. At the time, you fled from my thanks, but here you are a prisoner!” “Nay, I do not mean to detain him, Lucy, after all that has passed,” said the governor, taking her words in that literal sense, which they might indeed bear. “You must know he has been barring his doors against—” “I know it, sir. I was present when Mr. Cleverling made his report; and had I known then that it was this noble young man whom he was authorised to arrest, I would have interposed more warmly than I did; for I know that such an arrest would greatly irritate the town. I have overheard all your interview in the adjoining room, and come to enforce Mr. Field's words!” “Do you think he is sincere, Lucy?” “I should be ashamed to suspect him to be otherwise, sir,” she said, her eye kindling with shame at her father's suspicion, and casting towards Fleming an apologetic look for her father's weakness. “What he says to you, sir, are the words of wisdom and discretion. You have greatly angered the people, sir, first by your unguarded expressions of joy at the arrival of the news that the Stamp-Act had received the king's signature, then by calling over the soldiers from the castle, and lastly by billeting them in the private houses of the inhabitants! We owe this young gentleman the deepest gratitude for this open and disinterested act of friendship in coming to you, sir, and making known the danger that must follow the continuance of the troops in town!” “But suppose I send them back, and then the mob should be in the humor to take umbrage at me because I recommended—I mean because they suspect that I recommended to the ministry the Stamp-Bill—for no one can prove it upon me? You know what they have been threatening, daughter!” “The only way, sir,” said Fleming, “is to show confidence towards the town's-folk. This will disarm all animosity, and secure the safety of your person.” “Well, I will think of it. I will consult with the commander of the troops.” “And he, father, will urge you to retain them in the town; for they like their quarters here better than in the castle!” “I have received no remonstrance from the General Court,” he answered, moodily. “It is time enough then to send away the soldiers. What is this boy's words?” “Truth is truth, whether offered in a wooden bowl or in a golden vase,” answered Fleming, firmly. “I have spoken, sir, for your safety, and the happiness of those dear to you!” As he uttered these words, he looked towards the maiden with an expression in his fine eyes of ardent yet modest admiration. She was not insensible to the glance, nor did it displease her; for the slight flush of emotion that passed across her features proceeded from pleasure rather than from anger. High-born as she was, being the grand-child of a marquis, as well as daughter to the powerful governor of the colony, she was not indifferent to the fact that she had created in the breast of the handsome young colonist a sentiment of timid admiration and worshipping devotion. She did not, by any means, regard him without some embarrassment of feeling. He had been in her thoughts often since the time when they first met, three months before. Fleming had been to Cambridge to take his sister to her grandfather's, who dwelt in a small farm-house on the banks of the Charles River. He could go to the very door in a boat, and had taken one for the conveyance. On his return, as he was entering the back bay, he saw a six-oared barge crossing. He knew by the flag in the stern that it was the governor's. The wind was blowing strong, and a vessel near her, which had missed stays, suddenly was driven into her. The oarsmen sprung to save themselves by clinging to the fluke of the anchor and martingale, while the boat parting, sunk, leaving the governor and his daughter floating upon the agitated waters. Fleming was but a short distance from the scene of the disaster, and hastening to the spot, succeeded in rescuing both the maiden and her father, just as they were about to sink together; for, forgetful of his own safety, the governor had used every effort to sustain his child above the surface. The sloop hove-to and took them on board. The governor, in his gratitude, forced a valuable seal upon his preserver, saying, that whenever he wished his aid, to come to him or send that. When Lucy Hutchinson had a little revived, and wished to thank her gallant preserver, they pointed out to her his little boat dancing over the waters, and approaching rapidly the foot of the Common. From that time she had thought much of the young man, and had felt the greatest desire once more to see him; and having overheard, the interview between the young man and her father, and recognising the voice of the former, she entered the apartment to express her thanks. When she now beheld him, the advocate of humanity and the bold friend of his country, his naturally handsome face lighted up with the fire of patriotism, she could not withhold, in her heart, her admiration and interest. When she saw that he regarded her with similar feelings, a gentle joy was infused into her heart, which throbbed with new and strange emotions. She saw at once the motive (her happiness) which had brought him before her father. “I will think about the matter,” at length answered the governor. “Young man, you are at liberty to go free. I will send after Cleverling and order him to return. Until he comes back you had best stay within; for, if you encounter him in the street, there may be difficulty, and I want no more occasion for getting the people up!” “I will not remain. I shall not fear to meet him!” “You had best delay, Mr. Field,” said Lucy, earnestly. “It is better you should not meet the party.” “I cannot resist your request, Miss Hutchinson,” said Fleming. “If you will walk this way,” said Lucy Hutchinson, “I will try and entertain you with some portraits of the principal personages now figuring in England. This is Lord North—this Bute's—this Grenville's,” she added, as she conducted him to the opposite side of the large room, and pointed out to his notice the likenesses of these friends and supporters of the odious Stamp-Bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE PORTRAITS. THE young artisan gazed upon the portraits of his country's tyrants with deep interest, and feelings of stern indignation rose in his bosom at the reflection that through their agency, the colonies were in danger of losing those liberties which the pilgrim-fathers had purchased with privations and self-denial unparalleled in the foundation of a new state. He was not, without feelings of deep restraint against the governor himself, who, having given himself to the examination of some papers after his daughter had walked aside with him, seemed to forget their presence. His resentment towards him were, however, modified by regard for his daughter, whom he had not ceased to remember with a sort of romantic devotion, since the time he had been the instrument of her rescue. It was for her sake he had sought the presence of her father, resolved to endeavor to move him to measures less violent than those he was pursuing; for he saw that the vengeance of the people would by-and-bye outbreak upon his head, and that the innocent child would be involved in the ruin of the guilty parent. For her sake he had spoken so boldly and earnestly; though at the basis of all lay a sincere and earnest desire to benefit his fellow-colonists. The idea of resistance to the despotism of Great Britain by arms, had not been thought of, even amid the intense excitement of the day past. Men breathed aloud their sense of injustice of the ministry, and spoke boldly of their determination to resist the operation of the new law; but petitions, remonstrances, committees to wait on the king, these only were the arms they thought of to save their liberties from destruction. It was ten years prior to the declaration of independence, the seeds of which eventful act were sown this day in the bosoms of the patriotic colonists. They did not, however, foresee the important issues; few, very few bold and fore-sighted minds, only, had the least conception of such a vast result. Among those who most firmly spoke agianst the injustice of the law, were men fondly attached to the king and mother-country, who felt themselves a part of the great empire, and loved England, the home of their fathers, the endeared “mother-land,” with an affection nearly equal to the soil on which they were born. But these men were not Englishmen in slavish submission to power. They loved liberty. They had tasted its sweetness in freedom from the oppressive taxes under which the people in the mother-country groaned, and they had jealously resisted, by respectful petition, every attempt of the ministry, hitherto, to lay upon them the same burdens. When the report that a bill to levy a stamp-duty upon all written or printed papers in the colonies reached them, the return ship took back back earnest petitions, praying that such a bill might not receive the sanction of the king; and sensible men hoped that these remonstrances would be successful. And when, at length, the intelligence came that the bill had passed both houses, received his majesty's signature, and become a law, resentment, grief, and a spirit of resistance filled every bosom. Men spoke freely their minds, and murmurs against the lieutenant-governor were loud. He was termed a traitor to the interests of the colony, and the cries of “down with Hutchinson!” reached his own ears as he sat trembling at the consequences of the volcano he had been so rash as to kindle by his suggestion of the stamp-duty. It was from a fear of his personal safety, that led him to send privately to the eastle for the troops, whose presence had only served to increase the popular indignation against him. He at length scaled, as if led on by a blind fatality, his unpopularity and odium by the order which he issued for the citizens to take care of them in their houses. The consequences to himself of these injudicious measures, to give them their mildest appellation, were at once foreseen by Fleming; and while he felt the deepest anxiety on his sister's account, and entered fully into all the feelings of his townsmen, he trembled for the safety and peace of the lovely and high-born English girl who had not been out of his mind in the last three months. He therefore combined several motives in his visit to the governor's mansion—protection to his sister and his own home, a desire to be a mediator between the governor and the town, and a wish to avert from the head of the fair maiden, the calamity which pended over her father's, and in which she Lucy Hutchinson, the Governor's Daughter. was equally involved; for, if even she was personally unharmed in any outbreak of the people, her father's misfortunes, he knew, she would feel to be her own. Love has more than once been the spur to noble deeds. Fleming continued to gaze upon the portraits, but oftener diverted his eyes to the living and breathing portrait by his side. Her face was, indeed, worthy of the deep and earnest looks with which he stealthily regarded it, while his entranced ears drank in the liquid music of her rich voice as she discoursed to him of the characters of the various personages whose pictures hung upon the wall. Her figure was tall, yet not a hair's-breadth too much so, and grace and feminine dignity reposed upon her brow as upon their native throne. Her hair was a bright chesnut brown, bound at the back of her head in a knot of shining tresses. Her eyes were large, of a very dark hazel color, and sparkled with soul and feeling. Intelligence and sprightliness animated her beautiful features, and softened the character of firmness which the occasional resolved compression of her finely cut lips indicated. She was habited in black, a net shawl being drawn closely over her shoulders, finely displaying the graceful roundness of her bust and faultless elegance of her form. Her age was about twenty, perhaps a few months less, for a certain grave decision in her air, which took nothing from her loveliness, gave her the appearance of being maturer, perhaps, than she was. There was too, about her that indescribable tone of high birth which seems to belong to the noble families of England; but in her it did not take the aspect of pride or hauteur, but rather manifested itself in a refined gentleness of manner that could only spring from a refined mind and native amiability of character. Such was Lucy Hutchinson, the beautiful daughter of the unpopular governor. As she accompanied Fleming from picture to picture along the wall, they came to the open door through which she had come into their presence. “You asked me if we had the likeness of Sir William Pitt,” she said, smiling. “I see you are likely to think more of that than of the three others I have shown you. If you will walk into the next room you will find it hanging there. The governor has banished it from his library.” “I am glad then to see that you have taken it under your protection, Miss Hutchinson,” said Fleming, with an earnest and grateful manner, as he followed her into a drawing-room, more richly furnished than the apartment in which they had left the governor. It was also, like that, brilliantly lighted up, as indeed was every apartment of the mansion, for the timid ruler of the colony was apprehensive of an attack under cover of the night, and had taken this mode to prevent a surprise, the radiance from the lighted windows being cast far around the edifice to many rods distant. “There is William Pitt!” said the young lady, pointing to a venerable and noble head. “I should have known him without being notified,” said Fleming, as he gazed upon it. “In his face speaks a generous and daring spirit as well as wisdom and intellectual power. How different are the expression and character of his face from those of the arrogant Lord North, the haughty Bute, or the sycophantic and heartless Grenville. Miss Hutchinson, such a celestial aspect, for he looks a god, could never be listed on the side of wrong and oppression. Did these two men, Lord North and Sir William Pitt, now stand before you, and each asked you to follow them to fame and honor, taking different paths to it, which would you follow?” The maiden gazed up into his beaming eyes as he addressed her this question, and regarded him with admiration, not unmixed with surprise. At length she answered, “I should not hesitate. I should follow to fame and honor, if either, that man!” and she pointed impressively to the portrait of Pitt. “I knew you would make this answer. Every true and generous spirit would reply as you have done. In one of those two men you behold the despotic noble who would oppress us. In the other the fearless defender of our liberties. I cannot look into the face of Miss Hutchinson and believe for a moment, that she is the friend of the oppressor; that she cherishes principles which that great and good man would frown upon;” and he elevated his hand towards the portrait of Chatham, at the same time watching her face with deep attention. “I am not surprised at your boldness of speech, sir,” she answered with a richer color; “since I overheard all that you have said to my father. But,”— “If I have offended you by my freedom, pardon me, Miss Hutchinson,” he said with deep respect; “but I am a colonist. I feel as one, and cannot but speak as one.” “You have not offended me, sir,” answered the maiden, with some hesitation. “I honor you for your frank avowal of sentiments that no one should be ashamed to possess.” She spoke in an under tone, but with distinctness. “Is it possible, that I hear these expressions from the lips of the daughter of the governor!” he answered in the same depressed key. “It is not of necessity that I should think with my father on a subject upon which every one can form an opinion. I feel for, and strongly sympathize with your colonial friends in the oppressive measures of which the ministry are making you the victims. I have been with you long enough to understand and respect the character of the colonists. I know you are a brave, intelligent, forbearing and liberty-loving people. I have watched with pain the progress of events towards this crisis, and when to-day the news of the passage of the stamp-act reached me, I shed tears. I wept for your wrongs; I wept for the infamy that would fall back upon my country.” Fleming listened to her as if in a dream. To hear such sentiments from the daughter of the oppressor, Hutchinson, amazed him. He stood gazing upon her spirited and animated countenance with emotion and delight. Impulsively he took her hand, bent before her on one knee, and pressed it to his lips. She withdrew it, with her face covered with blushes, but without betraying anger. “Forgive me, Miss Hutchinson; but I feel towards you new emotions. I could lay my life down for you. From this moment you are next to my sister in my heart and thoughts. Pardon my words. I am bold, to speak as I do to one of your birth and dignity of rank— I, a poor artizan. If I have offended, forgive. I shall never forget how happy you have made me. Dare I confess to you—for you look as if you would listen without displeasure—dare I confess to you how much I have thought of you since that day I was so happy as to save you. You have scarcely been absent from my mind. It has made me both happy and wretched to think upon you; sad to know that you were the daughter of one who loved not my native land, and that you, perhaps, loved it not; sad that, however much I might dwell upon your image, it could be only to worship afar off; for rank and circumstances had placed you far above me and my station. Happy to know that nothing could ever rob my memory of the sweet remembrance of you; and that though we never met again, I should ever hold it sacred in my soul.” I have said, I fear, Miss Hutchinson, what I had better have left unsaid. But I could not resist the impulse to speak to you of the fullness of my heart. I shall go from you, at least, conscious that you are the friend of the colonies; and, for your sake, I shall try and love your father. It was for your sake that I came to advise him and warn him to-night. But I will not say another word. I have said too many already.” “Fleming,” answered the maiden, who had listened to him with a changing cheek and an agitated bosom; “I am not displeased at your boldness, though I do not know but that I ought to be; yet I will forgive you, for I know not how to be displeased with one to whom I owe my life.” “I do not desire to gain any clemency from that circumstance,” answered Fleming. “Yet this fact has made me think of you, when, perhaps, I ought to have tried to forget you. If, however, I am forgiven, and you have a kind remembrance of what I have been so happy as to do for you, will you allow me to take the only advantage of it that I desire to do.” “What is it you would say?” asked Miss Hutchinson, looking him in the face with an encouraging expression, yet looking confused; for she could not guess what he meant by his words. “That you would use all the influence you possess, to urge upon your father, mild and forbearing measures towards the people over whom the king has placed him in power and authority.” “That I will cheerfully do. It has hitherto been my aim to make him more popular with the colonists. I have not been blind to the position he holds in their estimation, and which reflects upon me; for I experience the coldness of the ladies of the commonwealth, whom I esteem, and whose opinions I respect. But my father is an Englishman in all his feelings, and shares with the nobility in all their prejudices against the colonies. I have talked with my father by the hour, laying before him the just claims of the people to his consideration, and endeavored to convince him of the unavoidable painful results that must follow a system such as he is pursuing.” “And what does he answer you, noble and generous maiden!” “That he only obeys the spirit of the government at home. He says that he is placed in power here, not to please the humors of the colonists, but the wishes of the king and his ministry. To day I have talked with him, since the arrival of the news that the Stamp Bill has passed and become a law.” “And what did he reply?” asked Fleming, with deep attention. “That his course towards the colony was mild, compared with that of the monarch.” “I am sorry that he should argue in a way that implies a natural love for oppression. Pardon me, but there is no necessity for such petty tyranny as that with which he rules us. Clemency and kindness would not bring him into disfavor with the king, while it would gain him friends with us here. The governor is not either king or ministry, that he should play the despot. A governor should be a friend both to the king and people. But Governor Hutchinson is the king's friend and the people's foe. He rules like an autocrat among serfs! like a general over a conquered province.” “I am aware of the great cause you have for censuring my father. I grieve at his course, and would cheerfully sacrifice my life to heal the wounds his injudicious rule has caused in the popular mind.” “Does he suspect your partiality for the cause of the colonists?” “He does not. I have been cautious while I have been zealous. He attributes my earnestness only as the result of a womanly desire to have peace. He loves me tenderly; but should he suspect how strongly I feel, I fear that I should lose over him even the little influence that I possess; for I have been so happy as to prevent his doing much more than he has done, to make his government oppressive. It is painful for me to speak in this open way of my father, but I know I speak to one who will not betray me, and who possesses nobleness of nature and generosity of character, sufficient to appreciate my feelings, and fully sympathise with my position.” “You do me but justice, Miss Hutchinson. I do sympathise with you, with all my heart. If I can serve you, command me. It is true, I possess but little influence as a citizen, and am but little known; but all patriots will be, and are my friends.” “You can serve me, by using your influence to appease the popular mind. Assure men that the governor will be just, and that they may confide in him. After what you have said to him to-night, for which I thank you sincerely, he will reflect, and I do believe, act with more discretion. I am sure he regrets his precipitancy already. His error has been in forming his opinion of the colonists, from his knowledge of the masses at home. The spirit evinced this day, has shown him his error.” “He has been long enough ruler over us to have discovered it before. But he has kept aloof from us. He has stood above us, and governed us, as if he dwelt in another planet. His pride and his prejudices have prevented him from mixing freely with us!” “All this has been wrong, and done him much injury among those whose good opinion would have sustained him in power.” “But it has done us great good, Miss Hutchinson,” responded Fleming, impressively. “How? I would that it may!” she answered, with a look of surprise. “By showing us the excellency of liberty. He has taught us to contrast it with despotism. By his despotic mode of governing us, he has taught us how his master will govern us when he binds upon our necks the iron chains of the Stamp-Act. The king had better stamp with hot irons, as slaves are branded, his royal seal upon each of our forcheads, to tell the world we are his slaves. He could do no more, if he did this, than he does by forcing this stamp duty upon us!” “Would to God the king had been wiser than his ministers, ere he had done this, or his ministers had been more just!” answered Miss Hutchinson, with emotion. “I see not where all this will end!” “It is a dark cloud that overshadows both lands. We are already a great nation, colonists though we are, Miss Hutchinson. There are five hundred thousand men among us whose knees have never bent, nor ever will bend, to the king's tyranny. These men can bear arms and have power to construct a separate empire in this land in the very face, and in defiance of the king, if he goad them to desperation. After the passage of this act, I do not see that any mercy or favor is to be extended to us. Bow in submission to it we will not!” “I shudder to fill up, or even contemplate the picture that you have so forcibly outlined. My fears tell me you have drawn that which will be. On the first of November this act goes into operation. It is close at hand. What dreadful consequences must follow the attempt of my father to appoint the officers of revenue and enforce the law.” “We must prepare for it. I see that if he persists in his present hostility to us, and his slavish submission to the will of the monarch, which he even transcends, that judgment will fall upon him.” “Do not prophesy. The evil I know will come, but I feelthat I must stop my ears.” “Danger shall not come nigh you, Miss Hutchinson. You at least, shall escape the consequences of your father's conduct. In me you have a friend, and through me, friends in all my friends. I shall not let you out of my thoughts a moment.” “Kind and noble young man. But I shall little regard my own personal safety while my father is in danger. I will talk with him before I sleep. I will lay before him the subject in all its bearings. I trust I shall be able to change his policy.” “If you induce him to send the troops back to the castle early in the morning, you will gain a great step for him in favor with the incensed towns-people.” “This I pledge myself to,” she answered resolutely. As she spoke, Cleverling's voice was heard in the adjoining apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE MEETING. “THE time has now come for you to depart,” said Lucy Hutchinson, in a low voice. “This interview with you has given me firmness and hope in this trying emergency. I shall always feel that I have in you a friend whom I can confide in at all times!” “You honor me, Miss Hutchinson,” answered Fleming, with a bright ray of joy dancing in his eyes, as they were bent upon her beautiful face. “I shall always be ready to serve you. Without betraying the interests of the colony, I can advise you whenever danger menaces you or your father. But even you, fair lady, could not make me a traitor! What I shall communicate to you will be for your personal safety. Do not fail, in the meanwhile, to urge upon your father mildness and clemency.” “I will not,” answered the maiden, firmly. “My father calls to me. Farewell!” “Shall we not meet again?” asked Fleming, earnestly, as he held her hand in his lingering yet respectful grasp. “Yes. I shall always see you with pleasure. But for my sake do not fail to use your influence with the town's-people to forbear. Patience and charity on both sides will prove the only protection against scenes of contest that I tremble to think upon! Remain here for a moment. I would rather that you and Mr. Cleverling should not meet.” As she spoke, she withdrew her hand from his, but not before a kiss had been impressed upon it, which caused the maiden blush to mantle check and brow. The next moment Fleming was alone. He could not but hear all that passed in the adjacent room, as Cleverling spoke in a loud tone of indignation, though his conversation with Lucy having been conducted in an under voice, passed not beyond their own ears. “What do you report, Lieutenant Cleverling?” asked the governor, after Cleverling entered. “That it is time, your excellency, prompt and severe measures were taken with these colonists!” answered the young officer, in an indignant tone. “Ah, Miss Hutchinson, good evening!” he added, as he saw Lucy enter. The maiden bowed slightly, and advancing to her father's side, stood by his chair, leaning upon it with one arm. “What has transpired, sir?” demanded the governor. “You have not found the young colonist, I know, because he has been with me, and I have pardoned him!” “Pardoned him?” repeated the officer, with surprise. “Yes, I have thought it best. His arrest would have created an uproar among the town's-people, as I find he is popular with them. It is better to be pacific and conciliate!” “Thanks, dear father, for those words,” said Lucy, in a voice of deep gratitude and joy, but speaking only to that he himself could hear. “He and his family, your excellency,” cried Cleverling, “deserve rather to be hung up by the necks. I have met with treatment that I never experienced before, and your authority has been openly despised!” “In what way? What has occurred? You did not find the young man. What then has happened to cause such agitation?” “I will inform your excellency,” answered Cleverling, pale with anger. “In obedience to your orders, I marched with a strong detachment of thirty men, a force which I supposed quite sufficient to overawe any of the neighbors who might be inclined to interfere. I reached the house, though not without meeting with various insults as we passed along the streets, such as being pelted with missiles, and called after with cries of approbrium even by the ragamuffin boys of the market-place!” “What cries did they utter?” asked the governor, looking displeased and alarmed at these popular exhibitions of hostility. “Down with the red-coats! Down with Hutchinson! No Stamp-Act! Liberty forever! No tyrants! No North! No Bute! Down with the Parliament!” “This is getting to be a serious affair! Such bold language, uttered in the very face of armed troops!” cried the governor, sternly. “These colonists have too much freedom. It makes them lawless. The Stamp-Act was needful, or, by the king's throne! they would rebel and set up a king and parliament for themselves! But what further happened? Instead, you see, Lucy, of sending back the soldiers to the castle, I have need to double the number in the town!” “Had it not been for the presence of the soldiers, father, these cries would not have been uttered!” answered the young girl, firmly. “I see that Miss Hutchinson is favorably inclined towards the colonists,” said Cleverling, in a sarcastic manner. “My daughter, sir? No. She speaks thus only because she is a woman. She is a true king's subject, Mr. Cleverling. Did I suppose she felt for them, I would call her no daughter of mine! But what more?” he asked, impatiently. “I reached the court where the house at which I had been refused admittance was situated. I was followed into the court by a rabble of not less than a hundred men and boys. I had twice to order the rear to face about and present their bayonets to keep them from crowding us, they were so insolently bold!” “You should have fired upon them, sir! You should have fired upon them, Mr. Cleverling!” exclaimed Hutchinson, in a voice of rage. “Had you killed a score of them I would have sustained you!” “No, father! One drop of blood thus spilled, had it been a child's, would have been followed by fearful carnage. I commend Mr. Cleverling for his forbearance!” “I thank you, Miss Hutchinson. Your approbation is so rare in reference to me and my acts that I shall duly value your praise!” This was spoken in a tone cold and ironical; for Cleverling had been an admirer of the maiden, but had wooed without success, as she perceived in his character traits that not only withheld her love, but respect. Now, whenever they met, it was with cool politeness on both sides. He took a malicious satisfaction at such times in repaying her refusal to encourage his addresses, by throwing irony and sarcasm into nearly every word addressed her. She, however, paid no regard to this system of petty revenge, being perfectly calm and unmoved by it. “I thought it not safe to order my men to fire, your excellency,” continued the young officer, “and forebore with them. Upon reaching the front of the house. I drew up my men and surrounded it. I then demanded admittance in the king's name. There was no reply. I thrice made the same call upon those within, and then ordered four men up to break in the door with the butts of their muskets. They obeyed, and the door gave way. I was then rushing in with my sword drawn, when I was suddenly caught up by a huge giant that lodges there, and thrown into one of the side rooms as if I had been a bundle of straw! The fellow shall pay for the act if I live to execute my vengeance upon him! He then seized two of my soldiers and threw them out of the door, knocking down with them three others who were behind them. Then grasping a heavy club which he carried, he laid about him as Sampson did with the jaw-bone of the ass, and in a moment cleared the yard of my men. I leaped out of the window of the room in which I had been thrown by him, and rallied such of my men as were not disabled, for five of them were either lying or seated upon the ground unable to stir. Infuriated at this reception, I gave orders for the men to charge bayonets and carry the house by storm!” “You did right! This is a fearful state of things!” cried the governor. “It would not have happened, father, if you had not brought the troops into the town,” said Lucy, firmly. “Silence, daughter! I shall begin to think with Cleverling that your sympathies are with these insurgents! Did you charge upon the house?” “I was about to do so, when a stout fellow came up to me and said, `Captain, if you are wise you will retire with your red-coats as peaceably as you can; for, if you attempt to push a bayonet or pull a trigger, not one of you will ever get back to your master Hutchinson alive! The man you seek is not here!' “He spoke in a deliberate tone, and with a determined resolution of manner that impressed me. I reflected a moment, and seeing that the court was filled with the crowd, I thought it best to forbear for the time. So I gave the command for my men to march, the crowd quietly and silently giving away on either hand for me to pass through to Cornhill. The wounded men were borne along each by two of their fellow-soldiers, until I got to the battery of cannon in front of the State House, where I left them in charge of those on duty there. I then marched hither without delay to make my report.” “And an alarming report it is,” responded the governor. “This is a strange state of things. I see that an example must be made. They will not learn a lesson till one or two of them have been strung up or shot!” “I would recommend your excellency to order all the force at the castle into the town,” said Cleverling, “and put the place under martial law. I would have this gigantic idiot arrested and shot, for you could not find a rope strong enough to hang him with! The young man, Fleming Field, I would also arrest and make an example of him. If such an outrage as that which has been done to-night is suffered by your excellency to pass unnoticed, the town will be unsafe for us. It would sound bravely in the ears of those at home, the report that the king's troops had been driven out of Boston by the town's-people!” “Such a report shall never reach England while I am acting governor of this commonwealth,” answered the lieutenant-governor, pacing the apartment like an enraged tiger. “This comes of forbearance and clemency!” “Pray, father, what forbearance and clemency have you shown, out of which these scenes have sprung?” asked Lucy Hutchinson, in a fearless manner. “So! you are half a colonist in heart now, I'll be sworn!” cried her father, turning upon her a fiery glance of suspicion. “Where is this young Fleming Field, whom I caused to be detained from clemency, for I did not wish Cleverling to fall in with him after I had promised him pardon? Has he done looking at the pictures yet?” “I am here, your excellency,” answered Fleming, entering the room. “I have been waiting your pleasure.” “My pleasure, then, is that you be arrested for this outrage upon Mr. Cleverling and the soldiers under his care, done at your house, and doubtless at your instigation. You have heard his story?” “I have overheard it, your excellency. The reception your officer met with would have been no less severe had I been present in person!” “It would not, fellow?” cried Cleverling, who had witnessed his entrance with profound surprise, which was changed to indignation and glances of menace, as he caught the firm, calm eye of the young colonist. “Do you utter such words in my presence, sirrah?” demanded the governor, sternly. “If Mr. Cleverling strove to enter a free citizen's house by force of arms, he was served right in being ejected forcibly!” “We shall see how that is, young man! Who was this giant he speaks of?” “My elder and only brother, your excellency. Nature has denied him intellect, but endowed him in lieu of it with vast stature and Herculean strength. He has but little sense, yet the possesses strong affections. His love to his mother, his sister and myself would do honor to the kindest heart. He guards our home with the faithfulness with which a lion watches over her young. In casting forth your officer, he but obeyed the instincts of his love; and I thank God that he hath endued my brother with strength of body to accomplish that which his heart prompted him to do!” “Your brother shall be arrested,” answered the governor. “If he has wit enough to defend his house, he is responsible for his actions. I am not to pass lightly by the injury done to five of the soldiers by him, to say nothing of the defiance of the king's authority, and of my own. Cleverling, you will take a sufficient force with you early in the morning, and bring this man before me. I shall detain his brother until you have executed your order. You may now retire to your quarters.” “Suppose, your excellency, that I meet with resistance?” “Fire without hesitation upon every one who dares to oppose you! I commission you to keep the king's peace, and if these mad colonists break it, let it be at their peril!” “It shall be, sir,” answered Cleverling, as he turned to leave the room. “Am I to understand that this young man is a prisoner?” “Yes!” answered the governor, after a moment's hesitation. “Then I will take him and place him under guard, if it please your excellency.” “Do so, for he is not secure here!” “Mr. Cleverling,” said Lucy Hutchinson, stepping between him and Fleming—for he had returned after reaching the door, and drawing his sword, approached the young colonist—“this young man is free! My father gave him pardon and permission to depart. Governor Hutchinson never yet broke his word! Mr. Field, you are at liberty to depart!” Her father looked at her with surprise. He made several attempts to speak, but kept silent. He seemed to fear before his noble and firm daughter. Cleverling glanced from him to her, as if to see which would govern. He saw the father's indecision yielded before the daughter's resolution. Nevertheless, his determination to secure Fleming at all hazards, combined with his dislike of the maiden, led him to resolve to apprehend the person who stood in the way of his lawless intentions towards Mary Field. “Mr. Field, if that is your name,” he said, laying his hand upon his arm, “I arrest you in the name of the king, and by virtue of this warrant, signed and sealed by the king's governor!” “Do you dare, and in this presence?” cried the indignant girl, her eyes flashing with haughty scorn. “I have received no countermanding order, Miss Hutchinson! Till I do so this man is my prisoner! Ho there, without!” His call was responded to by two soldiers, who had accompanied him to the outer door. They entered and looked at him for further orders. “Seize that man and secure him!” cried Cleverling. “Soldiers, leave this presence!” cried the indignant maiden, “and you, Lieutenant Cleverling, also depart! Do you insult the governor in his own house? It is you, sir, who should be placed under arrest were I in my father's place! Depart, sir, and presume not too much upon the governor's clemency!” “Fore God, daughter!” cried the governor, “you had best take my place and done with it, for I see you are playing the governor before my very eyes! I shall have to put you under arrest if you carry so high a hand!” “Did you not, sir, pardon Mr. Field? Did he not remain here at your suggestion till this officer returned, that he might not be arrested in the street? Will you now falsify your word, sir, and surrender him to the charge of a man who, for some reason or other, seems to bear against him private malice? While I am in your presence, sir, I will not see you thus wrong your own honor! Mr. Field is free, and, being so, should be suffered to depart!” “Well, he shall go then. Mr. Cleverling, you may retire. When I have further orders I will send for you!” Cleverling bit his lip with the most intense vexation. He would have answered freely, and spoken his mind to the governor, if he had dared. He retired, fixing upon Lucy a glance of defiance and triumph, and upon Fleming a threatening and malicious look. “Now, Mr. Field, you are at liberty to return to your own home,” said the governor. “You see my weakness. I have yielded to my daughter rather than acted as my position dictated. I gave my word to let you go free, and I keep it, as you see! But let me caution 4 you, young man, about resisting the troops, or heading any party against the lawful authority of the king. Let my clemency make you my friend and the friend of the king!” “I would ask, your excellency, if it is your intention to send to arrest my brother?” demanded Fleming, in a firm but respectful tone. “No; I will answer for my father,” said Lucy, quickly, and placing her arm affectionately over the governor's shoulder, and smiling in his face. “He will not take any further measures that are likely to widen the breach between the people and the crown!” “How so, girl?” answered the governor, with a frown, yet still with that air of affection towards her, which never deserted him. “Am I governor of this commonwealth, or are you?” “I do not wish to rule, sir, save by love. I am interested in your honor and happiness as a daughter. Any further steps taken in this affair will be only to gratify the vengeance of Cleverling. He thinks not of the king's honor half so much as of his own selfishness! The town is now almost in arms, sir, at the attack made by him to-night upon the private house of a citizen; and I doubt not but that deep retribution would have followed ere this, if they had not thought the soldiers had been sufficiently punished already by this young man's gigantic brother!” “Tell me what I shall do, then?” asked the governor, perplexed, between his personal fears and his desire to keep the good will of the ministry, whose policy he saw was despotic and hostile to the colonists. “If I pass this by, I shall be accused by the ministry of weakness; for the passage of the Stamp-Act clearly shows me, and all the world, the temper they hold towards these people! I am not the half so severe upon them as the king at home. What would you have? The king hates them, and I must hate them! The ministry oppresses, and I must oppress them! Parliament binds burdens upon them, and I must put them on their backs, or lose my place! Blame not me, but the king I serve!” Lucy made no reply. She looked sadly at Fleming, for she knew that he, as well as she herself, saw beneath the wicked fallacy of this defence. She knew that the guilt lay as much with her father as with the power he professed to obey. Fleming now prepared to go, when Lucy said quickly, “Do not return by the direct street, nor leave the house openly. Cleverling is a dangerous man, and, for some deeper cause than your resistance to him, he desires your ruin. Follow me, and I will show you a safe way out.” “I do not fear him, Miss Hutchinson. I am not a criminal, that I should fly secretly! I will go openly as I came!” “For my sake, Fleming, be discreet,” she said, in a low, impressive tone. The words, and the kind looks which accompanied them, made his heart bound with transport, and he knew not what wild hopes. “For your sake I will be everything but false to my oppressed country,” he said, with enthusiasm. “Then follow me this way!” Fleming turned back to bid the lieutenant-governor good night, ere he walked after her. “Then you are going, young man?” “Yes, your excellency.” “I warn you, then, not to meddle with this matter between the king and the colony. Those who are discreet will by-and-bye be the best off. Heads have fallen on the scaffold for a lesser matter than this of thine! But for my daughter's sake I have overlooked the crime. Take care of yourself henceforth!” Fleming then passed out into the hall, through the adjacent room, preceded by Lucy, who had already opened the door, and was waiting for him. She led him to the piazza in the rear of the house, and so down through the garden to a gate, which was locked on the inner side. Here a sentinel was posted, who, at her command, opened the way and suffered him to pass. He hastily pressed her offered hand with grateful devotion, and the next moment was on his way towards his own dwelling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE KING'S SHIP. SEVERAL days after the events which have been detailed in the last chapter, transpired, a group of persons were seen standing upon Fort-Hill, then an open green eminence, intently gazing down the harbor. Another and much larger group was upon Copps Hill farther to the north, and the summit of the more central height upon which was erected the Beacon, was literally black with a multitude; while the piers and roofs of the houses were crowded with spectators. The bells of the churches were tolling a funeral knell, minute guns were firing from Long Wharf, and the flags of all the vessels in the port were hoisted half-mast, as if some great and universal calamity had befallen the colony. The object upon which the attention of these numerous spectators was fixed, was a large ship that was slowly coming up the harbor under her topsails and top-gallantsails. The wind was very light, being scarcely strong enough to ripple the shadows of the islands which were reflected upon the surface of the water. The ship carried the English ensign, which, at intervals flashed its red folds out to the view of the eyes of all the people. The same proud flag floated from from the staff upon the roof of Governor Hutchinson's mansion, which was near Fort Hill, and commanded a view of the harbor. The faces of the persons composing the group upon this eminence, were sad and stern. A fixed gravity had settled upon their features that was singularly impressive. It seemed that one profound sentiment filled every mind—one powerful emotion swelled every bosom. Old men and young, matrons and maidens, and even children, were alike grave. Silence and awe rested like a cloud upon every one, accompanied by a painful air of expectation, like some multitude that has fled to a place of temporary security from the convulsions of the earth, and now stand waiting for the next appalling throe that shall shake the solid ground. Now and then words were interchanged between those who were nighest to one another, but they were articulated in a depressed cadence. The ship which was thus the central object of all eyes, and whose presence cast such an influence over the minds of the citizens of the town was the “Mentor” from London, and contained the bales of stamped paper ordered to supply Boston. She had been telegraphed three hours before, and the intelligence of her arrival in the harbor's mouth, spread like wildfire throughout the town. All pursuits were abandoned, and men and women hastened to the nearest elevation commanding a view of the sea, to gaze upon the approach of the king's ship. The interval which elapsed between the events narrated in the five preceding chapters and the present time, had not passed without excitement. The Governor, through the remonstrances of the principal citizens, had been wise enough to send the troops back to the castle, after keeping them two days in the town: and this judicious act contributed materially to mollify the public mind. The inhabitants seemed inclined to let matters remain for the present, without pushing things to a crisis; and to wait until the stamps should be sent over with the officers appointed to act under the new law. The vessel had been daily looked for to bring them over, for a week prior to her arrival. The people, however, remained quietly engaged in their several occupations and, at the suggestion of the town-rulers, bore themselves with submission to the Governor. He, on his part, seemed inclined to pursue lenient measures; and even was thought to be disposed to ingratiate himself with the chief towns-people. The colony, however, had not been idly waiting for the stamps to arrive and for the law to go into operation. Committees of correspondence with the other colonies were organized, and they advised to make “a dignified resistance against the usurpations of Britain and seek an honorable redress of their wrongs.” Petitions at the same time were drawn up, addressed to the crown, respectfully praying that the stamp duty might not be finally imposed; for it would tend to the ruin of the commerce of America, and destroy the best interests of Great Britain. The reply of the English governors, when they read these petitions, was that “the colonial gentlemen lived like lords upon their estates, or were becoming merchant princes by their commerce, whilst the people of England were poor and oppressed with taxes, to support and protect them.” Such was the state of public feeling, when the intelligence that the ship containing the stamped paper, was in the lower harbor. Slowly she came onward, laden with the fuel that kindled a flame, which was only extinguished seventeen years afterwards, when the last British soldier trod as a foeman, the American soil, and the last hostile ship of her humbled fleets, left her waters. Among the group upon Fort-Hill, stood three men, who have already been made known to the reader. These were William Lee, Fleming Field, and his brother Saul. They stood in front of the group of some thirty persons, who were upon the eminence. They were gazing in silence, and with thoughtful faces, upon the approaching ship. An air of resolulution and proud defiance was stamped upon the countenance of Fleming, as if he sternly felt within himself, that the efforts of England to enforce the stamp law upon the colonies, would be futile. “I am told by them as knows more nor I do, Master Fleming,” said an honest cobbler near him, a little bald man, in iron spectacles, and a long leathern apron nearly hiding his body, “as how if the stamp paper goes into use, we'll have to pay a tax for every thing. I heard Cummer Brown say, as how poor young folks couldn't get married for the expense! Now that is what I call a mortal sin, as well as a pity.” “And I heard say,” said a thin weaver; in a blue woollen cap and a gray woollen long coat, “that for every letter as is written, we must write it on the king's stamped paper, and pay two-pence for it to the Stamp Office.” “Yes, neighbor,” said the captain of a coasting sloop, “and what is more, for every bill of ladin, every ship's paper, we must pay to the king's officer, a stamp duty of at least ten shillings.” “But suppose we don't choose to write on stamp paper?” ventured the cobbler. “We could come the lap-stone over the king, that a-way.” “No instrument of any kind, no deed, no will, no bond, no simple note of hand,” said warmly, a lawyer near by; “no marriage contract, no bill of lading, no warrant of any sort, no writ whatsoever, no commission, no instrument of conveyance, no bail bond, no grant or title, no mortgage or release, no demurrer, no contract will be legal, unless written and drawn upon the king's stamped paper.” “Yes,” said a portly inn-keeper, “and every pack of cards is to bear a stamp duty of a shilling, and every pair of dice ten shillings.” “Every pamphlet and printed sheet of any kind, is also to be stamped more or less,” said a publisher of a journal, with an indignant glow upon his brow; “and what is more, upon every advertisement in the stamped gazette, is to be levied a stamp duty of ten shillings. Not even the almanacs escape the lynx-eyed ministry. Two-pence the king puts into his pocket, for every one sold.” “Methinks the king's majesty maun ha'a long pooch too hold all the siller,” observed a Scotchman, who had been the sexton of the old South a score of years. “Yes, the king 'll get rich out o' the colonies,” said the weaver. “Its no better than coining our flesh and blood into gold for him, this stamp act!” “I'd give a silver sixpence, enny how, to get a sight o' the stamp itself,” observed the cobbler. “The stamp, mon,” answered the sexton; “its na much ye'd see I ken. The stamp is put on the paper over in London, by the kang's secretary, and the paper is sent o'er to us for each mon to buy o' his stamp officer, when he wants to mak' use on't.” “And its done in red ink! an ominous color, that the king may take warning at!” said William Lee, stoutly. “We shall give the king's soldiers leaden stamps in blood, if he tries to make us submit to this tyranny of his.” “Then its the stamped paper, an' no' the stamps themselves, as is in the ship a comin' so gallant up the harbor,” said the cobbler. “Yes,” answered William Lee. “The telegraph says that the ship is the Mentor, which we knew by the last vessel that arrived, was to bring out the stamped paper. It comes in bales, and probably yonder ship contains paper enough to return to the king's coffers, if we are slaves enough to purchase and pay the duty, fifty thousand pounds. Doubtless too, the ship brings over the stamp officers.” “If they land, let's hang em,” cried Saul, the gigantic idiot, who had got into his brain, some general idea of the grievance men complained of; “let us hang 'em right up without prayers.” The words of “the natural” were caught up by the cobbler, the weaver, and two or three others, and the cry of “down with the stamp officers!” began to break upon the still air of the afternoon, when Fleming spoke. “My friends, peace! Let us be temperate. Nothing good can come of violence. The colony is prepared for this day, and for the emergency. Be assured, the officers of the stamp will not enter upon the duties of their office. Believe that not a colonist will pay a farthing for stamp paper. This is the sentiment we have all embraced. Let this suffice. There is no need of high voices or open acts of violence. There is a more effectual resistance.” “Master Fleming speaks well,” cried two or three voices. “We will be quiet, and let things take their course. We will soon see how it ends, and what comes of the king's law.” “Till then, patience, good friends,” said Fleming. “The ship has caught a fresher breeze, and comes gaily on, William,” he added to his friend. “I hope the people will be calm, and let the officers and paper be landed. Once on shore, they are both under our control.” “If I had my way, Fleming,” answered the shipwright, a cloud of dark displeasure passing across his brow, “I would take two hundred good men with me, board the ship ere she got to her anchor, and pitch into the harbor every bale of the accursed stamp paper, and the stamp officers after them.” “This would be a mad course, Lee,” responded Fleming. “It would, instead of the tax, bring upon us a civil war. We must not resist but with dignity and firmness. In refusing submission to this yoke, imposed upon us by England, we must not forget the respect we owe to ourselves.” “You speak always like a wise man. I act from impulse. You always prove to be right in the end, while I go wrong,” answered Lee. “It is your wisdom as well as your courage, which has made you so popular among the town's people, aye and even through the whole colony. The members of the General Court talk with you, and listen to your words; and every young man looks upon you as an idol. I do believe, that if you were to say the word, they would rise to a man, lock Hutchinson up in the castle a prisoner, and make you, young as you are, governor in his stead. I hear your praise in all men's mouths. When the mob, two weeks ago, would have sacked his house, your single presence turned them aside and appeased their fury. The fire-brand which I held in my hand, somehow or other, you made me give up to you without a word; and when you stamped it out, I shouted with the loudest my hurrah.” “You give me undeserved praise, William,” answered Fleming, smiling at the other's earnest and kindly warmth of feeling. I have but done what others in similar circumstances would have done better. The ship is furling her sails to come to an anchor. I am glad to see that the people remain such quiet spectators. They are resolved to comply with the earnest request of the committee of safety, and leave events to its more legitimate guidance.” “Is it true that all the lawyers, notaries, and attorneys, resolved at a meeting last night, not to make use of any stamp paper?” asked Lee. “Yes; and the commttee of safety, as well as the general court, have pledged themselves to uphold and sustain them, and every man who refuses to make use of it.” “But suppose a captain should want to clear his vessel after the act goes in force, which will be in five days from this, the first of November; he must have it made out on stamped paper, and pay the stamp duty for it, else if any English man-of-war falls in with him, he will be declared a pirate; for England, you see, won't recognise any ship's papers as lawful, unless they are made out on stamped paper. Now what shall an honest captain do? He can't stay in port, and if he goes to sea without stamped papers, he is liable to lose his vessel?” “It is better he should not go to sea, than in a single instance acknowledge the right of Parliament to impose the duty, by submitting to pay it. If he is a true patriot, he will let his vessel rot in the dock, before he goes to sea carrying upon his papers the stamp of vassalage. But this matter will be arranged between the committee of safety and the governor. He will, probably, find it expedient to grant to such captains exemption papers, which will secure them from capture.” “Hutchinson will not do this,” answered Lee firmly. “We do not know what he will do, until the hour of trial arrives.” “This will be soon; for within five days this new act becomes a law over all the colonies, from Boston to Savannah,” answered Lee. “The ship has dropped her anchor, and is furling her topsails. To tell you the truth, Fleming, I would rather she had not been suffered to enter the harbor. I consider the very mud at the bottom of it tainted by the touch of her anchor. A ship that bears in her bosom the chains sent to bind us, should never have found the American soil, even though ten fathom of salt water flows above it. But patience, as you say, and we shall see the end of it.” A deep murmur now passed through the throngs upon the eminences of the town, as a boat shot out from the side of the anchored ship, and pulled in towards Long Wharf. “That boat brings, doubtless, an officer to wait on the governor, and tell him our chains are ready,” said the impetuous Lee. “Did you notice the ship fired no gun coming up the harbor, as they usually do. They knew they were bringing what would not be well received.” “Perhaps they thought the minnit guns firin' on the wharf, enough burnin o' powder;” said the little cobbler. “Well, let 'em come. Neighbors, suppose we take a run down the hill, and so past the Battery, to State street, and see the landin' o' the stamp officer-man.” “Is he like a lion, and has he a mane, and can he roar as well as stamp, Flemmy?” asked Saul. “Bless you, honest idiot,” answered the weaver, looking up at the face of Saul as a man looks up into a poplar, “its no a monster-beast, this stamp, with feet to stamp on a body with, ony a seal like to put on paper. Ye need not be afeared o' it, man.” “An it was a lion I'd no fear it,” answered Saul, brandishing his bat-stick; and then taking his leathern ball from his pocket, he tossed it high in the air. As it descended, he hit it a strong blow, and sent it a hundred yards down the hill. It was pursued by a troop of boys, and also by Saul himself, whose only companion it was, as this pastime was his sole occupation. For hours he would play upon the Common with the school-boys, and seemed only happy when engaged in this his favorite amusement. His skill was so great, that he could strike the vane upon the old South with it, scarcely missing once in a hundred times. His bat afforded him also a formidable weapon, being nearly as large and heavy as a capstan-bar. The service he had done with it on the night of Cleverling's visit to his dwelling, had been passed over by the governor, who had discretion enough to see that any steps taken to arrest him would be unsafe, as Saul was a town-favorite, and his cause every man would make his own. The most of the group followed the cobbler and weaver down the hill; and at the same time a movement of the masses upon the two other eminences took place, and they also began to flow towards the heart of the town, to witness the passage through the streets of the person who had come on shore in the boat. The side-walks were soon filled with gazing citizens. The shops and stores were already closed, and from many of the windows of the houses were hung black scarfs. The bells continued to toll their funeral peals, and at solemn intervals, the heavy boom of the minute gun shook the town. Across State street, as the officers, for there were three in number, ascended it, through the lines of people, suddenly appeared before them banners strung from window to window, bearing the following mottoes: “Liberty and Property Forever!” “No Stamp!” There was no cry made. Not a word escaped the silent throngs, as the officers passed along towards the residence of the governor. They seemed to be amazed at what they witnessed around them, and walked on pale but firmly, escorted by the governor's private secretary, a young man who every one esteemed, and perhaps out of respect to whom they forbore uttering aloud their contempt and resentment. Governor Hutchinson met them at the door of his house, and received them warmly in the presence of hundreds who had followed them to the front of the mansion. “You have turned out the whole town to honor our landing, it would seem,” said the British officer. “They have done it voluntarily, I assure you, gentlemen,” answered the governor, in a tone of mingled fear and malice, as his eye glanced upon the gazing multitude. “You have done well to reach me in safety. I am sorry you did not come over in a frigate. One anchored off the wharves would give me the whole place by the ear.” “They seem to be very much excited,” answered the British officer, “though they spoke only through their placards. Do you think they will be so mad as to refuse submission to the law after it goes into force, on the first?” “They are obstinate enough to do any thing! I am little better than a prisoner in a besieged place.” “I would raise the siege soon, if I were the king's governor here,” answered the officer haughtily. “I have tried every measure. Nothing will do but to send some score of the chief men to England, and hang them there. You have brought the stamped paper?” “Yes, your excellency. I have come to report to you its arrival, and to know when and where I shall land it.” “That I will tell you by-and-bye,” answered Hutchinson, as they passed into the central hall of the house, and disappeared from the view of those without. Fleming and William Lee had not left the hill with those who went to see the debarking of the king's officers. After remaining looking at them as they walked up Long Wharf, until the buildings concealed them, they conversed together a few moments in an earnest manner, and then grasping hands, separated; Lee to go towards the docks, and Fleming to proceed by way of Milk street, in the direction of his own abode.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE DEFEAT. THE young artisan, to avoid the crowd which thronged the streets in the vicinity of the governor's residence, took a devious route, passing in the rear of the mansion, and past the gate of the garden by which Lucy Hutchinson had let him out. As he came near the gate, a loud shout rose upon the air from the people in front of the mansion. It was occasioned by the disappearance of the officers within, the closing of the door, and the appearance of a soldier with a musket to stand sentry upon the steps. The shout caused Fleming to linger and listen, for his fears were instantly aroused for the safety of the high-born maiden, whom he loved with all the ardor of his being. Since their parting at that very gate, four weeks before, he had met her frequently, and their meetings had served to bind together, in pure and elevated love, two noble hearts, which heaven had formed to be mated, though fortune had cast their lots widely apart. But love knows no aristocracy. Lucy Hutchinson's gratitude had first been awakened towards the preserver of her life, and gratitude is the parent of a tenderer emotion. She had not ceased to feel a deep interest in the young stranger, to whom she owed so much, and when she learned that he was a young artisan, her interest, if possible, was increased, and perhaps was stronger than it would have been had the handsome and courageous young man been of her own rank in society. His bold and fearless bearing in the presence of her father, his generous patriotism, added a sentiment of admiration to her deep gratitude; and the union of these two emotions produced a feeling towards him that paved the way for that surrender of the heart which subsequently followed. The passion which Fleming entertained for her was modest, as became his condition, but it was open and elevated, like his own frank character. He loved her, he knew that he loved her as he could love no other, yet the sense of his own lowly state did not lead him to shrink from indulging the high hopes which at times swelled his bosom. He was not presumptuous, but her gentle kindness, her manifest interest in him, caused him to cherish hopes that otherwise, he felt, would have been madness. They were like each other in character, and it was natural that they should assimilate. He felt grateful for her regard for him, and returned it with a passion pure and adoring. His romantic love won the noble-hearted maiden's heart, and she frankly surrendered it. Thus they were secretly lovers, and mutually happy in their interchange of hearts. To Fleming it seemed a transporting dream. He could hardly realise that his aspiring love for the noble maiden was met with a return. He wondered that when he dared to unfold to her ear the secret of his passion, she had not haughtily forbade him her presence. Sometimes they met by moonlight in the garden, and walking the shadowy avenues discoursed together, now of the state of the colonies, now of England and her glory, but mostly of love. He had recounted to her all his heart's history, and she had given him her own. Thus mutual knowledge of each other bound them closer together, and made them both friends and lovers, for the holy dignity of friendship does not always walk side by side with human love. He loved to speak to her of his sister, and at her request he brought Mary one evening with him to the gardens, and made them known to each other. The maidens at once became interested in each other, and so Mary, loving and beloved by both, became, as it were, a new link to bind the lovers together. Though Miss Hutchinson was highly educated, yet in no instance did the artisan or his lovely sister betray that they were of humbler condition than herself. Nature had given them beauty of feature and nobleness of person; and natural intelligence had availed itself of all the resources of education then furnished in the colonies to all classes, and such resources were far from being inconsiderable. In all that goes to elevate the intellect, inform the judgment, and instruct and purify the heart, the brother and sister were the equals of the governor's daughter. The graces of painting and of embroidery, the accomplishment of the guitar and harp, Mary Field had not; yet Lucy thought her no less lovely in mind and person, and missed them not in the sweet purity of her character, the beautiful expression of her soul-full eyes, the music of her loving voice, and the artless mirthfulness of her disposition. The two maidens became friends. If Lucy had not loved Mary for her own sake, she would have loved her for Fleming's. Once or twice Lucy had paid a visit to the house with Mary, and was charmed with the neat simplicity of all that she beheld. Pure taste and native refinement of mind had placed their delicate seal upon every article in the little parlor. The influence which Lucy exercised over Fleming, though unconscious to herself, was very great. He seemed to take a new and higher tone of feeling and sentiment from the reflection of her love. He seemed to wish to make himself in all his acts worthy of the rich treasure of her love. Whenever he mingled among his town's-people, men marked a certain dignity in his air, and grace of bearing, that involuntarily drew their attention and commanded their respect. When he spoke, as he as well as other young men did, to the assembled citizens in the numerous caucuses held for discussing the question of resistance or submission to the stamp-act, he seemed to be endowed with a power of eloquence unknown among them. He swayed and moved them at his will, and yet unconsciously to himself, as it seemed. He was listened to by the wise and the venerable, and his sentiments were afterwards repeated as well in the hall of the rich colonist as in the stall of the cobbler. All men commended him, and his name was spoken with praise and high hopes by every tongue. He bore with modesty all this popularity among his fellow-citizens, rejoicing in his influence only so far as it bore upon the public good. Lucy Hutchinson could not but hear of his praises, and she felt that when she gave her heart to the young artisan, she had not misled her judgment—that he was worthy of a richer gift far than that she had bestowed. He was now about to enter the gate, before which he stood under the impulse of apprehension lest the governor's daughter should be alarmed by the shouts of the crowd, anxious also to know the cause of it, when he heard a footstep within the garden rapidly approaching the gate. It was a man's step, and the rattling of the chains of a scabbard told him that he was a British officer. He drew back behind an oak that grew a few feet from the gate to observe who should pass out, as he did not desire to be seen by any one, lest his presence there might be construed into some hostile purpose against the governor; for he had already got the name among the English officers as a leader of the insurgents. The gate opened, and Cleverling came out. He cautiously looked around, as if not wishing to be observed, and then crossed the street, and passed forward, muttering, “The way is clear. All the town is on the other side of the house, and I am likely to have the field to myself! That monster too is there with his infernal bat and ball! So to love and beauty I steal my way!” These words had not been quite distinct to Fleming's ear. He heard, however, enough to show him that the man was bent on some evil design. His sister Mary instantly occurred to his thoughts, and he resolved to follow him. Since the time he had been thrown from the house by Saul, Cleverling had been at the castle, save within a day or two past, when he was staying in town on leave. During this period he had once been seen by Mary passing the court and looking up it with attention. She turned pale when she saw him, but did not mention the fact to her brother. Fleming had supposed that he had ceased to think of her. But as he now took the way in the direction of his house, he resolved to see that no mischief came of it. Cleverling did not look around, but rapidly walked on. At the corner of the first street he was met and passed by the governor's secretary, who was coming from the opposite direction. Cleverling haughtily bowed, and after going by him, turned and said, “Landreth, if you hear the governor or my colonel inquire for me, say I shall be back by sun-down. I am going to Cambridge.” With these words he passed on. The next moment Fleming met the secretary. They grasped hands like two brothers. “What did Cleverling say to you?” asked Fleming. “To say that he goes to Cambridge, and will be back by sun-down,” answered the young secretary, George Landreth, a pale, but intellectual looking young man, with a remarkably fine eye and mouth, and an appearance strikingly elegant. “Have you just seen Mary?” “Yes. She was at the governor's with Miss Hutchinson when the ship was coming in, and I have just escorted her home,” replied Landreth, slightly blushing. “Is she alone?” “Yes. Your mother has not come in.” “I wish you to return at once and see where Cleverling goes. Hear those cries and shouts! I hope the citizens will not forget themselves! I have my suspicions of the man. I do not wish to wound your feelings, George, but Cleverling has conceived a free liking for Mary, and has once been hurled from the house by Saul for following her home from church. Now that she is your betrothed bride, you are equally her protector with myself. Follow him, and see that he does not go to alarm her with his presence. I was following him, but you will protect her quite as efficiently as I could do. I wish to go back and speak with Miss Hutchinson, and if possible obtain speech with her father, for a crisis is approaching. Do you hear those shouts? I must be there and do what I can to arrest violence, if it is likely to break forth. To you I entrust the sacred trust to protect Mary!” With these words Fleming pressed his friend's hand, and hastened back towards the governor's mansion, from the front of which every few moments loud and menacing shouts arose. George Landreth's eyes flashed fire at the intelligence which Fleming had conveyed to him touching Cleverling. He had never suspected this, though he well knew the libertinism of his character, and had little fellowship with him; for a pure man instinctively shrinks from the companionship of the licentious, while they repay his aversion by hatred and contempt. It is thus the evil and the good are separated one from the other in this world, and it is thus they will be in the next. Character is “the great gulf fixed” that divides hell from heaven! When Fleming left him, Landreth hastened with rapid steps after the officer. He soon came in sight of him, and kept him in view until he saw him turn up the court, when he became satisfied of the evil of his intentions. The streets in that part of the town were quite deserted, the lover and the libertine being the only two in them. When Landreth reached the entrance to the court, Cleverling was not to be seen. Satisfied that he had boldly entered the house, he hastened up the court, and, leaping the fence, opened the door. As he did so a wild shriek reached his ears from a distant part of the house. He passed into the front room. A military glove lay upon the floor. A chair was overturned. The door on the opposite side, leading to a small breakfast-room, was thrown open. He rushed into this apartment and across it through another wide open door leading through the kitchen into the yard. The outer door was closed, but opening it, he found himself in a small court-yard, which was bounded on one side by a narrow lane. As he came in sight of the lane, a carriage was driving along it at full speed, in the direction of the west part of the town. He pursued it with the fleetness of a deer, for he knew that it contained Mary and Cleverling. An obstruction in the way for a moment detained the carriage. Cleverling, looking out to see what it was, beheld Landreth in pursuit. Before the coach could proceed, George was at its side. He sprung at the door and wrested it open. Cleverling, taken by surprise, was 5 hurled by the collar to the ground. Mary was on the forward seat, with a deep woollen cap drawn over her face and mouth. Landreth called her by name, and removing it, clasped her to his heart. “Release that young woman, sirrah!” cried Cleverling, in a fury of madness at this interruption of his well-planned flight with the lovely colonist. “Villain!” cried the indignant lover, springing out, armed with Cleverling's own sword, which had been left upon the carriage-seat, “defend yourself! I am the protector and avenger of this maiden!” “She is my mistress, fellow! release her!” “Foul liar!” cried Landreth, striking him across the mouth with the flat of the sword. “Were it not for her presence, I would punish you with death upon the spot. Go, sir, and thank me for your life.” “You shall answer for this with your own,” responded Cleverling, black with rage. “Give me up my sword.” “One so base is unworthy to wear one,” responded Landreth, as he broke it in two with his foot, and cast to him the fragments. Cleverling would have sprung upon him if he had dared; but his eye quailed before the steady determination of that of the young secretary. He took up the pieces of his sword and was about to walk away, when he seemed to recollect the carriage, which was one of those one horse chariots, then in vogue, and usually driven by a negro. A black lad was now upon the seat trembling with affright. “The carriage shall convey Miss Field back to her house,” answered Landreth. “Then it is at your service.” Cleverling bit his lip with rage and vexation. He looked as if he half resolved to make an attempt to rescue his lost prize, but discretion got the better of his wishes. He remained standing where Landreth left him until he saw the carriage stop in the rear of the house from which he had forcibly borne the lovely colonist, and Landreth take her from it and convey her almost fainting with the alarm she had undergone, into the dwelling. The chariot then returned to where he stood, when getting into it he drove rapidly away. “God must have sent you to my rescue, dear Landreth,” said Mary, after she was sufficiently recovered to be able to converse and express her gratitude. “I was going home when I met this unprincipled Cleverling, and soon afterwards your brother Fleming. He told me he suspected him to be coming here, and desired me to watch him, as his presence he felt, was needed at the governor's. He amazed me by telling me that Cleverling ever knew you at all.” “I never saw him, save when he followed me from church, and once or twice since, when he has been here with the soldiers, or passed by at the foot of the lane. I have always feared him.” “How is it that he was able to get you into the carriage so soon from the house?” “I was in the garden looking at a chariot which I heard entering the lane, little suspecting its purpose, when I heard a step in the house. The next moment Mr. Cleverling appeared, and running towards me, caught me up in his arms. I shriked, when he stopped my mouth with his hand, and bore me swiftly to the carriage. He placed me in, drawing, at the same time, a cap over my face, and getting in after me, bade the driver to proceed nor spare his horse. I used every exertion to escape from the carriage, when he threatened me with instant death unless I was still. This menace caused me to make stronger exertions, hoping he would indeed kill me. At this instant, you came up, and I am saved.” “Cleverling shall answer for this with his life,” said Landreth, sternly, as he rose and walked the room. “Be composed, dearest Mary. He shall be rewarded to the top bent of his iniquity.” “Do not take any vengeance upon him, George,” cried the maiden with alarm. “You will only endanger your own life, and also make public what you had best suffer to pass in silence.” “There is wisdom in your words. The busy tongue of slander may make more of it than it is if it gets abroad. I will let it pass, unless he crosses my path. But here is Saul. I would he had been here a quarter of an hour earlier, and you would have been safe.” “Mr. Cleverling told me in the carriage when I called on their names, that he knew my brothers were both absent, and said that I was beyond reach of all succor. But for your providential presence, I should have been.” “Well, Saul, I am glad to see you,” said Landreth. “Come with me to the door, I have a word to say to you.” “I ha' been up to the goveny's, Georgy. I never see so many people afore in my life. How they did holler! I didn't get to see the stamp though. I guess they keeps him in a cage. If I see him I'd grapple him, wouldn't I. I'd kill him as quick as I would a kitten.” “Never mind the stamp, Saul,” said Landreth, taking him by the hand and leading him to the gate. “I have something for you to do.” “Well, I'll do it for you, Georgy,” answered Saul, laying his huge hand kindly on the young man's shoulder. “You know Lieutenant Cleverling!” “The red coat and gold on it. I know him and he knows Saul,” replied the giant, with a fierce look, at the same time grasping his bat-stick. “He has been here a second time, and tried to carry off your sister, who is to be my bride. Listen, Saul, and don't be too hasty. You must act like a wise as well as a brave man. He did not succeed, though he got her into a carriage; but I rescued her, and she is, you see, in the room.” “I'll kill him. I told him I'd kill him,” cried Saul, fiercely. “No, you must not kill him, Saul. Do what I wish and you will punish him better than killing him. Besides, if you kill him you will be hanged.” “I don't care, I'll kill him.” “Saul, you must listen to me,” said Landreth, firmly. “If you would do your sister a service, follow my directions. I have not told Fleming of it, as I wish to give you an opportunity that I know will please you.” “Well, let me hear, Georgy.” “Cleverling is staying at the house of Mr. Oliver, He will probably be there to-night, as it is too late for him to get over to the castle, it being now within a few minutes of sun-down. You must watch for him as soon as it is night, and get possession of his person. You know you can carry him where you list, as if he were a child.” “I know it, Georgy. He knows it too,” answered Saul, almost savagely, and with a look of triumph, as if proud of his enormous strength and huge stature. “When you get possession of him, take him to the old wind-mill on the point at the back of the Beacon hill, and there detain him until I come. See that you do not harm him though.” “I'll do it, Georgy. But, Georgy, if he an't at Mr. Olivey's, shall I take a boat and paddle down to the castle after him?” “No, we must wait till he comes again to the city. But I do not think he will leave town, as he has a week's leave, and has been up but two days. You must be wary and not let him see you and suspect you, for he already fears you.” “Yes, I gave him cause to, Georgy, I did. I will not let him know I want him. The dog! to try to hurt litty Menny. Here's brothy Flemmy. Don't you tell him, Georgy, or he won't let me go.” “I won't, perhaps, mention it to him,” answered Landreth, as Fleming came up. “Where are you going, Saul?” asked Fleming, as his brother moved rapidly away as if he did not wish to be questioned by him. Saul pretended not to hear. “I have sent him on an errand of my own,” answered Landreth. “But you looked flushed. What has occurred?” “How is it about Cleverling?” asked Fleming, quickly. “Was he here?” “He came and”— “And what? Why do you hesitate, George?” “Then I will tell you all, if you promise me that you will leave him to me.” “Has he been insulting Mary, then?” cried Fleming with a flashing eye. “Promise to leave him in my hands, and you shall hear what has occurred,” answered Landreth, who at last thought it best to tell him. “I promise then.” “Come in and you shall hear,” said Landreth; and they entered together the little parlor where Mary sat in tears, which she strove to brush away and to smile as she saw her brother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE MOB. “TEARS, my dearest sister!” cried Fleming, regarding her pale face with surprise and concern, the roseate reflection from the sun-set sky falling upon it, scarcely overcoming its deathly hue. “It is nothing, Fleming!” she said, striving to look cheerful. “I have thought it best to tell Fleming all,” said Landreth. “For God's sake, let me hear all!” he cried with emotion. Landreth then proceeded to relate what had passed. Fleming listened with a dark frown upon his brow, and firmly compressed lips. He did not utter a word, until Landreth had ended. He then remained silent a moment, crossed the room, and affectionately kissed his sister, and then grasped George Landreth's hand. “Thanks, George, thanks! a brother's gratitude for what you have done. But you have your own reward. Good evening. I shall not return till late—perhaps not till morning. Remain here and leave her not.” With these words he rushed from the room. George laid his hand upon his arm as he was going out of the court door. “Fleming, where do you go?” “To seek the villain Cleverling. I saw him not ten minutes before I came home, getting out of a carriage at Mr. Oliver's. Little did I guess for what purpose he had called it into his service. I hastened home, not suspecting that he had been here, when I saw him in the carriage, yet anxious to learn if he had, and also to tell Mary I should be out to-night; for there is intense excitement in the town about the arrival of the stamped paper.” “You must not seek Cleverling, Fleming. You promised me that you would leave him in my hands.” “A brother alone should punish him.” “Leave him with me. You have higher duties to call you to action. If the towns-people are excited, your influence and presence will go far to prevent any outbreak.” “What will you do. You must not call him out, George! He is a villain, and your life is to valuable to be pitted against his.” “I do not intend to call him out openly, because I do not wish the affair made public, for Mary's sake. He, of course, will keep silent.” “I thank you for this consideration for her. But he must not go unpunished.” “He shall not. When next we meet, I shall be able to assure you, I trust, that he has been dealt with as he merits.” “What do you mean to do?” “I have a plan in which Saul is to be my agent. To-morrow I will let you know the result.” “I trust to you wholly, George. Stay now and protect my sister. You will not be needed at the governor's. I have been there and seen Lucy. She tells me her father, though intimidated, is in great glee at the arrival of the stamped paper, and intends to-morrow to appoint his officers. One of them is certainly to be Mr. Oliver, who is now with him. He resolves, I am sorry to say, to carry the law into effect, notwithstanding the hostile demonstrations of the people against it. He appears to me infatuated. He is, however, encouraged by the officers who came in the ship, and by private letters from Bute, Chatham, and Grenville, which Lucy heard him read aloud, telling him to be firm in enforcing the law, and assuring him of being sustained by the authorities at home. So his madness is sealed, and I fear, his own fate.” “I have, in my capacity as his private secretary, tried to show him the impossibility of carrying the law into effect. But he would not listen, or listening, only speak with contempt of any successful resistance of the people, declaring that the first man who made resistance, should be arrested as a traitor, and sent to England for trial.” “For his lovely daughter's sake, I pity him!” said Fleming. “She challenges all our sympathy,” answered Landreth, with feeling. “She is keenly alive to her father's weaknesses, and I may say wickednesses,” said Fleming, “while all her heart is with the colonies. She ought not to suffer with him; yet she must, as a daughter, feel all her father's misfortunes.' “Do you apprehend any evil will befall him from the violence of the people?” “I cannot tell. I shall do all in my power to prevent it. The only course we have to pursue, is to send a remonstrance to the crown against the act, and petition its repeal. This is the sentiment of the judicious and reflecting. But the majority of the people are too impatient for such slow measures. They reflect but little, and act impulsively. They feel the wrong as present, and wish to right themselves upon the instant. Instead of applying for redress to the fountain of the wrong, the crown, and waiting the result, they are prepared to visit with vengeance, the agents of the wickedness. When I left the governor's a little while since, where I went to see Lucy, and advise her not to be alarmed at the concourse of people, and also to try and obtain an interview with the governor, and prevail upon him to send word to the committee of safety, that he would not for the present land the stamp paper.” “Did you see him.” “No. Lucy advised me not to then, as he would be sustained in his despotic intentions by the presence of the officers of the crown. I fear the most painful consequences will follow the landing of the paper. I shall endeavor to see him this evening, through Lucy's agency. But what course do you intend to take to avenge Mary's wrong?” “I have seen Saul, and told him what Cleverling has been guilty of. I stated the whole affair to him clearly, and his strong affection for her made him comprehend the wrong, and at the same time aroused his feelings. I then told him where he would probably find Cleverling, and instructed him to get possession of his person in any way he could, whether in the house or street, and bear him off under cover of the darkness, to the ruined Mill on the shore, west of the Beacon Hill.” “This is a strange proceeding, George! What do you intend to do with him at the Mill?” “To make him fight me in single combat, and with his life atone for the insult he has offered to Mary. There can be no objection to this private proceeding.” “But he may slay you, Landreth!” “No. Our combat shall be with swords. We are both masters of the weapon; but I have on my side something to fight for, while he with have nothing but his miserable life. Say not a word, Fleming, you know I am as resolved as you are when I purpose.” “I will say nothing. God above will prosper the right. But if he is slain by you.” “The cause of his death will remain an impenetrable mystery. But I shall not try to kill him. He is vain of his person—of his fine walk, and his elegance in dancing. I shall punish him enough by aiming to humble his vanity.” I would not have his death on my hands, though he richly merits death.” “The punishment you design for him, will be severer even than death, if you are the victor.” “Believe me, I shall be.” “Be careful of yourself, George, for your life is dear to one whom we both love.” The two friends then parted. Fleming hastened towards the State-house, where he heard the confused sounds of voices like the first mutterings of a storm; and the lover returning into the lowly dwelling of the maiden to whom he had committed his heart's keeping. When Fleming entered Cornhill, he saw a dense mass of people about the State-house, a short distance up the street. He heard loud shouts break upon the air, and torches were brandished, casting a wild glare over the agitated mass. The twilight had not yet deepened into darkness, the rosy hues of the west still lingering in the sky. The presence of torches so early therefore, indicated some startling purpose on the part of those who bore them. He hastened forward at first with a rapid walk, which he increased at a run as he distinguished the cries of “Down with Hutchinson! Down with the Stamp-Officers!” “What is the meaning of this, Thomas Crafts?” he cried, as he came up, laying his hand upon a man who carried a torch in his hand. “Ah, Fleming, are you here? But you are too late. You had best let us have our own way,” answered the man kindly but firmly. “Too late for what?” “You see we have got possession of the two cannon in front there, and have driven the soldiers down King street to their barracks. Not a red coat dares show his face.” “Who instigated this?” demanded Fleming, in a tone of mingled grief and anger. “No man more than another. We are all leaders, unless you The Mob. choose to take the head. You are too moderate, by half, for a lover of his country.” Fleming made no reply, but hastening forward, forced his way up to the cannon, around which were gathered a score of men with flaming torches. He sprung upon one of the guns and, taking off his cap, waved his hand and called for attention. A hundred voices shouted his name in tones of welcome, and silence prevailed throughout the vast and lately excited mob. “My friends, my brothers. What is this you do? Are you consistent when you call the king and ministry tyrants, and yet yourselves do deeds that would level you with them whom you detest. Because they would make us slaves, shall we make ourselves rebels and insurgents? Are we not the subjects of Great Britain? Are we not loyal Englishmen at heart? If we are not, whose subjects are we? To what nation do we belong? Have we, is any one of you so bold as to say, thrown off all allegiance to law and order, and made anarchy our king?” “No, no!” cried numerous voices. “We are the king's loyal people,” answered a man near him; “but the king has forgotten his duty, and we would teach him that if we are his subjects, we are also a free people.” “Yet it is not freedom to make yourselves the servants of misrule,” replied Fleming in the same bold tone in which he had before spoken. “The king has done us a grievous wrong. We cannot make him repair it by guilt. We should show him by our forbearance and by dignified remonstrances, that we are a people worthy of his confidence and love; not confirm him in his opinion that we are unworthy to hold the liberties which we inherited from our fathers. The stamp act has been passed. It has become a law of the land. The stamped paper has this day arrived in a king's ship, and with it, two stamp officers. Now what is it you would do, for no one of you will consent to use the stamp paper.” “No, no! no stamp—no duties!” cried the multitude as the voice of one man. “This unanimous declaration is enough. Let the echo of your voices reach the shores of England. Let it penetrate the palace of St. James. Let every lord in the land hear it. Let it enter the halls of Parliament in the shape of petitions for repeal and firm and respectful remonstrances against the oppressive law. My word for it, England will listen to it. The throne will heed it. The law will be annihilated by the very hands that framed it, and we shall once more be free. We have friends in England, warm, eloquent, influential friends, who will become our advocates and plead our case. The immortal Chatham is himself a host. His voice, already lifted in our behalf, shall yet be listened to, and the law will be repealed. Trust to this, my friends, and think not of taking the cause in your own hands. I have heard your cry against the governor and against one of our own townsmen, whom he is said to have named as a collector of the stamp duty. These are not your game, and torches and stones and shouts of opprobrium, not the weapons a free people should use. Aim higher. Use nobler weapons. Let your eyes be fixed steadily upon the throne itself, and the instruments you would use, petitions.” “No petitions! No base praying to our oppressors. Manly resistance with fire and sword, if need be,” cried Thomas Crafts, in a stern tone. “This course will only bring ruin upon us. The king's armed ships will fill our port, his armies overrun our streets. England is too proud and powerful to be insulted. The conqueror of India, the victor in a thousand wars, will not let idly pass forcible resistance to her laws, whether we think them just or unjust.” “What would you have us do? Tamely submit!” asked Crafts, with a frown, and looking about him with the dogged determination of a man who feels that he is the voice-piece of the majority. “In five days the law will be in force. We must use paper; we must have deeds, wills, bonds, marriage certificates, shipping papers, aye, we must have cards and dice, and what is to be done? If we write on paper not stamped nothing will be legal. If one man buys a single sheet of stamped paper it will be confessing the right of the king to put the duty.” “Wait until the first of November comes,” answered Fleming, calmly. “We shall then best see what steps to take. The governor may find it expedient to take the responsibility of suspending the operation of the law until our petitions and remonstrances reach England.” “He will never do this. If Governor Bernard were here he might, but not the lieutenant governor!” cried several voices. “Let us do nothing till the trial is made, my friends and fellow-townsmen,” said Fleming. “For one, I have no doubt but he will yield to the popular will, and suspend the operations of the law. But this will depend much on your moderation. You have done wrong to surround his house with menacing cries. You have done wrong in taking possession of the cannon. Such steps only serve to widen the difficulty. If you retire peaceably to your homes and wait the issue, I am very sure that the governor will suspend the law.” Thomas Crafts and a few of the leaders of the mob conversed apart a moment, and the former then addressed Fleming. “You speak, Master Fleming, of the governor's suspending the operation of the law. If he will do it on the first, he will promise us to do it now. Will you wait on him in the name of all here present, and put the question to him flat? We will escort you to the house and wait outside for the answer.” Fleming hesitated how to reply. He saw the firm position the people had taken; and he trembled for the result, if the governor should refuse to make the promise. His situation he felt to be a trying one. But trusting that he might prevail upon him to give the promise, though he hoped against hope, he answered, “I will wait on the governor, but I will go unattended. You will either remain here, or what is better, retire to your several homes. The governor will not be menaced to it; and if he finds you are quiet he may make the promise.” “We want no favors of him,” answered Crafts, loudly. “Menace or no menace, he must give the pledge! We will wait here for you, Master Fleming, until the old South clock strikes seven. It is half an hour to it now.” “I will do the best I can,” answered Fleming sadly, as he sprung to the ground from the cannon; for he felt that he was going like one sent on a forlorn hope. The crowd made way for him to pass, and then most of them went homeward to get their suppers ere he should return; while a few of the most determined partisans seated themselves upon the gun-carriages and about the steps of the State-house. Many, of whom one was Thomas Crafts, a wealthy blacksmith, were armed with clubs. Crafts himself exhibited in a belt, a pistol and broad sword, which, however, he kept covered in the presence of Fleming by his overcoat. This man possessed a certain influence among his fellows; and, employing some forty workmen in his shop, he had them now about him ready to obey his will. Fleming walked on in the direction of the governor's house, deliberately, with no little anxiety of mind, upon the object of his mission. With a clear judgment and uncommon foresight, he saw with regret, what must be the ultimate issue of violent measures to obtain redress. He thought he foresaw the vengeance of the crown resulting in the ruin of the colonies, and the final extinction of those privileges which they enjoyed above the subjects of the king at home; while he believed that mild measures would bring about a repeal of the act. He also was solicitous for the happiness and safety of Lucy Hutchinson, in case the vengeance of the mob should be visited upon her father. Every motive of love and of patriotism prompted him to endeavor to conciliate both parties and recommend on one side clemency, on the other forbearance. As he was passing Milk street, he was surprised to see a party of men issuing from the door of a house which he knew to be the residence of William Lee. At first he supposed it to be some five or six of his journeymen; but as they continued to march out four and four, till full seventy men had passed into the street, he began to suspect some covert purpose; and when, as he walked near them, he saw that every man's face was blackened, and that each bore some weapon, he was convinced that William Lee meditated some secret expedition. The last man that came forth was William Lee himself, and he was the only one not disguised. “William,” said Fleming, grasping the stout stick he carried; “where are you going with such a party?” “Ah, Master Fleming, I would like to have gone without your seeing me; but you shall know. I have certain knowledge that Hutchinson has sent off for the stamped paper to be brought on shore secretly to-night under cover of the darkness. He intends to have it stored in Oliver's new house at the foot of King street. That house you see, he has been building for a stamp office, but not a king's stamp ever goes into it.” “What do you intend to do?” “I will tell you frankly, Fleming, for I am resolved, and you needn't say a word to move me. Peace and forbearance will do well enough to talk about, but it won't answer in practice. I intend to take the bales of stamped paper into my own keeping. If they don't reach Hutchinson he isn't obliged to put the law into force; for no stamped paper, no stamp law. This, you see, is taking the viper by the tail and snapping his head off. It is laying the axe at the root. It will save the governor a deal of trouble, and make all quiet. So don't say a word, for as much as I love you I shan't listen to you. That stamped paper shall never see the inside of Oliver's stamp office.” Fleming reflected a moment. He saw from Lee's determined manner, that he could not dissuade him from his purpose; and it occurred to him, that if the paper could be arrested in its progress to the stamp office and destroyed, it might for the time serve to mollify the public excitement, although its ultimate consequences might fall heavily upon the colony. “But,” he said mentally, “in this dilemma there seems no alternative. If the king sends troops to punish us, we must resist with arms in our hands, and, if need be, sever our allegiance to the crown.” “I have nothing to say, William,” he added aloud; “only take no man's life.” With this injunction he left him, and Lee led his men towards the harbor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE OUTBREAK. FLEMING, aware that he could not obtain an audience of the governor by applying at the front gate, took his way around the grounds to the entrance of the garden. He found this gate closed and locked within; but having a key furnished by the hands of the governor's daughter, he placed it in the wards. He was in the act of opening the gate, when his attention was drawn by the sound of a heavy tramping, like a horse moving over frozen ground. As the object came nearer and evolved itself out of the darkness, he beheld the gigantic figure, of his brother Saul. Thrown across, his broad shoulders was hanging downward some large burden, as a hunter carries a deer that he has slain. As he passed close by the gate at a heavy round trot, Fleming saw that it was a man suspended by the heels across his back, head downwards. He did not need the aid of a lantern to see who it was. He knew that it could be Cleverling and none other. Fleming did not speak or betray his presence. He fell a stern delight in seeing the libertine in the hands of his brother; nor could he help smiling at the ludicrousness of his situation. Cleverling, however, beheld him, and raising up his face as well as he could, he cried, “For the love of mercy, whoever you are, come to my aid and rescue me from this savage monster.” As he spoke, Saul gave him a blow with the flat of his hand upon the cheek and bade him be silent. The next moment they were lost in the obscurity of the distance, though the groans of the wretched man and the heavy tramp of Saul's feet, as he took his way in the direction of the old mill, were long heard. “There is just retribution. I pity the man, yet I would not rescue him. He deserves this. I trust that the noble-minded Landreth will meet with no harm from him. But Heaven will give victory on the side of virtue.” He now entered the garden and traversed it to a terrace which 5 led round to the west side of the house, and gave access to a long window that opened into the drawing-room. This window he had passed through before under the guidance of Lucy. He threw it up and entered the room. It was perfectly dark. He crossed it to a door, through which gleamed a light. He went to it and softly opening it, beheld Lucy writing at a table with an anxious countenance. He entered, and catching the sound of his footstep she raised her eyes and recognizing him with an exclamation of joy, rose and caught his hand. “I am so glad you have come, Fleming,” she said in a pleased but low tone of voice; “I was just writing a note to you.” “I will read it now,” he answered, smiling as he took it up from the table. “No, I will tell you what I would have written.” “But I will hear also, thus I shall have a two-fold pleasure—the sweet sound of your voice and the silent music of your exquisite hand-writing.” “This is no time for flattery, dear Fleming.” “I cannot flatter those I love. But what is it you would of me?” “I tremble for my father. He has just received an anonymous letter, threatening, if he brings the stamped paper into his house, that not one stone shall be left upon another.” “Did he intend to do so?” “Yes, for safe keeping, by the advice of the three king's officers, and also of Colonel Mortley.” “But he has since changed his determination, for I but now learned it was to be landed at the new store-house just built by Mr. Oliver, in King street.” “Then this threat has induced my father to alter his mind. I hope it is so. These are indeed fearful times, Fleming. I wrote to you to endeavor to turn aside the popular tide which sets so fiercely towards my misguided parent. I know your influence with your fellow-townsmen. They will listen to you when they will hear no one else. Go abroad and keep with them and among them. Let them commit no rash acts. I tremble for my father's life.” “His life will not be touched, though his house may be attacked.” “Is this probable, Fleming?” she asked, pale but firm. “Yes. The popular excitement is at a great height. There is only one thing that will allay it. It remains with your father.” “What is it that he should do?” she asked with deep earnestness in look and tone. “I am sent hither by full two thousand men, now assembled about the head of King street awaiting me. They have possessed themselves of the two cannon placed there, and compelled the soldiers to retire precipitately to their barracks where they have shut themselves in, apprehending an attack upon it.” “Oh, when will these troubles end. I sympathize with the brave colon sts in their wrongs, yet I cannot but strongly condemn the course they are pursuing to obtain redress.” “It is to be censured by every true patriot—by every discreet colonist,” answered Fleming. “But the people now have the head and nothing will stop them in their course but a change of policy on the part of the licutenant governor. As I came hither I met sevently resolute men, headed by one of the boldest spirits in the cause, who with blackened faces and armed with clubs, were marching towards the docks with the avowed purpose of seizing upon the stamped paper as soon as it lands.” “This is fearful news. It will lead to consequences dreadful to contemplate.” “We must do what we can to turn aside the evil. I am sent hither by a body of my townsmen to demand audience of the governor; and ask him if he will give his promise that on the first of November the operation of the stamp-law shall be suspended until petitions and remonstrances can be sent to the crown.” “This is a moderate request, Fleming,” and shows a better disposition on the part of the people than I hoped for. This is the only proper course for them to take. My father cannot refuse this request, as he knows that upon it hangs the safety and peace of the commonwealth.” “I have come to ask him. Will you see if he will receive me?” The governor was standing by a window looking forth upon the harbor. His eyes were particularly directed to two lights which shone on the decks of the “tax-ship,” as the vessel which brought over the stamps was called by the colonists. He was alone; the officers having left him, to superintend the debarkation of the stamped paper. He was suddenly roused from his meditations, which were by no means conciliatory towards the colonists, towards whom, if possible, he entertained hourly more vindictive feelings; for he had made the differences between them and the crown a personal and private feud, to which he brought all the animosity of his nature. “Father,” said Lucy, taking him by the hand, “Mr. Fleming Field is in the house and desires to see you.” “I can hold no speech with him. I have to-day made up my mind. I am satisfied that the crown will sustain me if I should set fire to this insurgent town, and return to England in yonder ship.” “Mr. Field is sent sir, by a body of two thousand of his fellow-townsmen, who await his return at the head of King street. It is too serious a mission, sir, for you to treat it lightly. Your dwelling may your life, my dear father, is in danger.” “What do they want of me?' he asked moodily. “Mr. Field will inform you, father,” she answered, going to the door, and ushering Fleming in. “Well, young man! So you are sent to speak with me by a mob of insurgents.” “I am sent to your excellency by a body of freemen and loyal king's subjects,' answered Fleming respectfully and firmly. “I have heard of you, sir! Half the rebellious spirit in the town is owing to you, sir! You are a leader among them. I don't know but, now that you are here, that I ought to let you depart. It is my duty to arrest you, and send you prisoner to England, charged with treason.” “Your excellency, I have done much to prevent open acts of violence in the town. My influence is small, but what I have, I have exercised on the side of order. It is with the hope of preserving peace, that I have consented to wait upon you, at the request of my fellow-townsmen.” “What do they demand?” “They are willing to leave the issue to respectful remonstrance and petition to the crown for a repeal of the law. They, therefore, desire time to send to England, and to hear the answer of the king and parliament to their prayers. They authorise me to say to your excellency, that if you will promise that the law shall not go into operation on the first of November, but be suspended until we can hear from England, that they will retire peaceably to their homes, and return each man to his occupation and craft.” “This is modest, by the king's head. Very modest indeed! So I am to suspend a law of the empire on my own responsibility.” “But consider, your excellency, the circumstances! These will be taken into consideration at home, in extenuation of your conduct.” The governor seemed to reflect. His daughter watched his countenance with the most painful solicitude. From her heart went up a prayer that God might give her father wisdom. “And if I do not make this promise?” asked the governor, fixing his eyes upon Fleming's face. “I cannot answer either for the security of your house or your person.” “This is come to a pass. I must throw myself, I dare say, into the castle, and upon the protection of the troops. I will do this at once; so take back my answer to these rebels. Tell them the law shall go into force on the first day of November, as decreed. I shall take no responsibility. Come, my daughter, at once begin to get ready, for I shall go down to the castle in the morning.” “You have not five minutes, your excellency. A half an hour was allotted me to deliver my errand and receive your reply, and convey it back to the waiting multitude. I have no power to prevent any course they may see fit to pursue, on learning your refusal to this just and expedient request.” “I shall not consent to it.” They dare not attack me. They know they would be hung, every dog of them.” “Their minds are in that state, sir, that they care little for results to themselves. They count their lives as nothing, compared with the liberty which they inherit from their pilgrim-fathers.” “Father, I entreat of your listen to the people!” cried his daughter with tears in her eyes. “I will not. They dare not touch my person or my house. There are five hundred soldiers at the castle. I will send express for them.” “It will be too late. Already the time has expired in which I should return,” he said, as the tongue of the old South loudly tolled the hour of seven. “Do you think, young man, that they will have the audacity to try to injure my mansion?” asked the governor, with some anxiety. “I will not answer for any acts of violence they may commit. Do you hear that deep shout, your excellency. Not seeing me return, they are moving hither to meet me, and to know what you say.” “Father, be wise; dear father, do not sacrifice yourself. Be entreated, and give them the promise!” cried Lucy, with eloquent pathos. “Hark! those shouts are like the dashing of the angry surges upon the shore. They grow nearer and louder, and each moment ring more fiercely in my ears.” “Your excellency, if you will be guided by reason and self-preservation, you will not withhold the promise they solicit. Already the street is filling with them before the house!” he cried, as he looked from the window upon the dark masses of men moving towards the gate, their stern faces made visible by the glare of a hundred pine torches. “Look at this scene, your excellency, and as a friend I would urge upon you to give the pledge.” “Father, for my sake, if you love me, yield!” cried Lucy, pale with terror as she looked forth. The governor walked to the window and gazed out upon the agitated multitude, with their torches, banners, and clubs swayed and brandished above the heaving surface. The banners were displayed so as to be distinctly read from the windows. Upon them were, “No Stamps.” “No Taxation Without Representation.” “Vox Populi—Vox Dei.” “No Tyrants, nor Tyrants' Tools.” “Down with Hutchinson.” “You see, sir, the state of the public mind,” said Fleming, observing that the governor looked alarmed. “A single word from you, dear father, and all this storm, which seems ready to pour its fury upon our heads, will be allayed.” “The governor was silent. He struggled between pride and hatred of the colonists, and personal fear. Duty to the crown was little in his thoughts as a motive to obstinacy. The mob now began to cry out loudly for Fleming. Thomas Crafts, and seven or eight of the leaders entered the gate, from which the sentinel had fled on their first approach. “There is no time to be lost, your excellency!” said Fleming. “I will not yield the promise,” answered this singular man, in a determined tone, that under a higher motive, would have commanded admiration. But his intense and bitter hatred of the colonists, transcended for the moment, his fear of personal injury; and under its influence he answered as he did. Fleming saw that there was not an instant for delay, as Crafts, with the current of the mob setting after him, was near the door; and seeing Fleming, he called to him to come out. “Lucy, there is no further safety here!” cried Fleming. “Fly through the garden, and seek shelter at my mother's. No! do not venture into the streets alone. Stay by the gate for me. I will follow you in a few moments. Governor, if you would save your life, follow your daughter. I assure you, that I shall no sooner report your refusal, than your house will be assaulted with a fury that will be irresistible.” “Master Fleming, do you come out, or shall we come in and fetch you?” cried Thomas Crafts. Fleming lingered an instant, till he saw Lucy safely beyond the fated dwelling, and then returned to open the door. The governor was in the hall, standing irresolute. “Mr. Field, do you believe that they will dare to enter my house? I can barricade the doors and windows.” “You hear them already beating loudly upon the door! You have yet time to turn aside this tornado. Bars and bolts will be like straws before them.” Ere the governor could reply, the door was dashed in as if with a catapult. Hutchinson fled to one of the back rooms, with a cry of fear. Crafts and Fleming met in the hall, face to face. “We have waited, Master Fleming, past the hour. What says the petty tyrant?” “He refuses to give the promise, I am sorry to say.” “The tyrant refuses!” cried Crafts, shouting to the people who were crowding up the steps. “He refuses! He wont promise! Down with him!” was echoed from mouth to mouth, till the very skies rung with the vast uproar. “Let us down with the house!” cried Crafts, in a voice that rose above the rest. “Torches, men! Axes and torches! Down with the tyrant's palace! We will smoke the fox out of his hole! Light up, men! Torches to the four corners!” The work of destruction and devastation now commenced. The mob divided themselves into bands. Some set fire to the corners of the house, others rushed into the rooms, both up stairs and below, with axes and bludgeons, destroying the furniture, and casting it forth to heap upon a bonfire. Costly pier glasses were shivered at a blow, and chandeliers torn from the chains which suspended them, and dashed out of the windows. The valuable library was demolished, and papers of immense value destroyed. “Here is a drawer full of gold and silver!” cried a man aloud, as he split open a secretary with a broad-axe. “We shall make money, my friends!” and he began to fill his pockets, while others came up to do the same. “Throw that gold into the bon-fire!” suddenly cried Crafts, pointing to a large fire burning in the court; not a dollar of it shall go into any man's pocket. We have not come here to rob the tyrant! Not a farthing's worth of value shall be taken away by any man! The flames shall consume all!” At length the mansion, by far the most magnificent and best furnished house in the colony, was destroyed. The plate, the pictures, the furniture, the apparel of the governor, and nine hundred pounds in specie were destroyed. The governor's coach, which had been preserved from the conflagration of the stables, was then dragged into the street, and an effigy of the governor, dressed in the laced clothes and cocked hat which had been found in the house, was placed in it, and thus marched in triumph through the city. Behind and before the coach, were fastened placards, reading, “No Stamps.” In the procession one person carried a large square banner, on which was represented a man with “Liberty” inscribed upon his hat, with his foot in the act of stamping upon the neck of a man, who was labelled “Doctor Stamp Act. Beneath the devise, were the words in large letters, “We have no Stamps but the feet of Freemen.” The procession proceeded to the liberty tree, and here hanged the effigy of the governor, placing in one of his hands a paper, purporting to be the dying confession of the stamp act; and in the other hand a picture of a horned devil, labelled, “Hutchinson's Prime Minister.” While these scenes were being enacted in one quarter of the town, events of equal interest were going forward in another. The party led by William Lee having reached the Long Wharf, placed themselves in concealment in an old store-house, near the head of it, and waited for the passing of the bales of stamped paper. At length, after an hours time, a spy came from the end of the wharf, reporting that the bales, sixteen in number, were landed, and were being packed in a cart, which the governor had sent for the purpose of conveying them to Mr. Oliver's store-house. William Lee, upon the receipt of this intelligence, selected ten of the most resolute of his party, and instructed them how to act. The cart, at length, came rumbling along, and passed the spot were they were in ambush. It was drawn by two horses, and about a dozen marines walked on either side of it in file. “Now, my friends, to the capture. Each of you single out his man, take his musket, and leave him to be bound by those who follow.” Lee then bounded forward. His men reached the cart at the same moment with himself. The guard was in a moment surprised, disarmed, and given into the charge of the remainder of the party. Not a gun was fired; scarcely a word spoken, till the cart with its contents were in the possession of its resolute captors. “Now, my friends, we have got the lion,” said William Lee. “We will look at his teeth.” At these words, a bale was cut open with a cutlass, and the stamped paper exhibited to their various inspection. “Now what is to be done with this?” “Fire, William, tells no tales,” answered a man of the party. “True, and they will burn as well as any paper. But we will first destroy Oliver's store; for by the light and the report of this lad, our friends are busy burning. Hutchinson's mansion. This store was erected as a stamp office, and it must come down.” In less than half an hour, the new brick edifice was levelled with the ground. The cart, containing the bales of stamped paper, was then escorted up King street, with sheets of the paper displayed on poles above it, and rendered visible by the light of torches. The rumor of what Lee and his party had done, soon spread throughout the town, and reached the mob assembled around the liberty tree, which, with fresh shouts of triumph, mounted their effigies upon old horses, and moved in procession to meet Lee's advancing party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. SAUL AND THE HUZZAR OFFICER. THE licutenant governor had succeeded in escaping from the fury of the enraged mob by flying from his house through his gardens, the moment he beheld their leader enter his hall. He then saw that his faith in the people's reverence for a king's governor's house and his person was wholly fallacious. He repented when it was too late; and overwhelmed with dismay at the crisis that assailed his ears, and with bodily fear he hurried after his daughter, who, when Fleming left her in the gardens to return to speak with Thomas Crafts, had, with noble filial devotion, flown back to suffer with her father whatsoever might befall him. “My child!” cried the governor as he beheld her; “fly and escape. The house will be in flames, and these fierce men will not even spare you. Take my arm and let us seek safety at Mr. Oliver's.” “Alas, sir!” cried Lucy; “do you not hear the name of Mr. Oliver mingled with your own in their shouts. Come with me, my dear father, and I will find for you a more humble and safer assylum” “Let us hasten then. If I am seen I am lost. They would not hesitate to hang me up on the first tree. Let us escape on board the ship,” he cried, become nearly a child with fear, as he heard behind him the wild shouts, accompanied by the glare of the ascending flames, by the light of which they threaded the avenues of the garden. Lucy was firm and calm. She possessed one of those spirits that always rise to the level of every emergency. She sustained her father, rather than he her. She encouraged him by her coolness and self-possession, and bade him yet hope for the best. She uttered no word of reproach; betrayed no feeling, that all was the fruit of his own proud and imperious temper. Fleming, in the meanwhile, having returned into the hall, endeavored to stay the storm of violence which he saw bursting forth. He ran here and there, made eloquent appeals to ears that were stopped to words of forbearance. He dashed the torches from the hands that were applying flames to the portico, and exposed his person to the angry violence of his friends. But all was in vain. He saw that the tempest would rage till it exhausted itself; and turning from the painful scene, he hastened to the protection of the maiden whom he had directed to await him in the gardens. Ere he reached her, the roof of the mansion was in flames, and the glare of noon-day lighted up half the town. “All is lost, sir!” he cried to the governor. “Nothing less than the total destruction of the house and its contents will sate them.” “My papers, my money, my valuable books!” he exclaimed, clasping his hands in grief. “Can nothing be saved?” “Nothing, sir! Even your own life would be sacrificed, I fear, should you be taken. I passed men searching for you as I came into the garden, and turned them on another course. You have no time to linger or bewail your misfortunes, sir. One word from you would have averted all this great evil.” Fleming spoke sternly; for he felt that this act of the people would bring upon the colonies the vengeance of the crown, and wholly defeat the object all good men had in view—the repeal of the obnoxious act. “You are very kind, young sir, to take such an interest in the safety of myself and daughter. Do you know where we can find shelter until I can escape to the island?” “Yes, your excellency. My own house, though humble, is at your disposal. There your person will be as safe as my own.” As Fleming spoke, he opened the gate and preceded them, Lucy leaning upon her father's arm. He was, however, so overcome on turning back and beholding the flaming ruins of his magnificent abode, that he had nearly fainted; but at the request of Lucy, Fleming supported him on one side, while she lent him her aid on the other. In this way, their road made as plain as if lighted by the sun, so brilliantly flashed upward the fiery tongues of flame, they at length reached the abode of the young artisan, and were ushered by him into the little sitting-room. “My dear mother and sister,” said Fleming, “I bring you as guests, Governor Hutchinson and his daughter. They have been driven from their home by violence and fire, and this house is to be sacred to their security and repose, so long as they see fit to honor it.” Mrs. Field, with that gentle kindness of hospitality which wins the heart, took the governor's chapeau and offered him her large arm-chair; while Mary, folding Lucy in her arms, kissed her with tears of sympathy. “Where is Landreth?” asked Fleming, not seeing the young secretary. “He saw the flames shining into the windows, and fearing that it was the governor's house, where he has left many valuable things, he hastened at my urgent desire, to see and save what he could.” “Then I fear he will be in danger. If men see him in their present madness, they will sieze upon his person. I must go at once after him.” “But all men love him, Fleming,” cried Mary between hope and fear. “They will net lay hands upon him.” “I will not trust them,” answered her brother. “Yet I know not how to leave you. My presence is needed at home if any should seek the governor here.” “Here is George returned!” cried Mary as the young secretary entered the room. “God be thanked!” he cried, as he looked round upon the group, and beheld the governor, Miss Hutchinson, and Fleming. I feared the worst since I have witnessed what I have but now!” he cried. “What a fearful pass things have got to be in the town. It appears like a place carried by storm and given up to pillage and flames. The wild shouts of the infuriated mob even reach us here. But now that you are all safe, Fleming will remain here while I go and try to save some thing from my room.” “It will be rash to go near the terrific scene,” cried Fleming. “Your position as the secretary of his excellency will expose you to insult.” “I do not fear it. I will be cautious. If I find I am in danger I will at once return, leaving my little property to its fate.” Fleming, finding that he was determined, made no further objection, and Landreth departed, receiving at the door from Mary, an earnest injunction not to place himself in the way of danger. When he reached the gate of the garden he found it open, and bands of persons roving it in all directions, destroying the fruit tress and statues, and carrying devastation every where. Pulling his cap down over his eyes and concealing his features by the collar of his cloak, he passed up the garden towards a part of the house where his room was situated, and which he saw was yet free from flames. Suddenly two men darted from behind a tree and laid hands upon him, rudely casting aside his cloak from his face. “Ah, pardon, Mr. Landreth,” said one of the men. “We didn't know but it was Hutchinson, whom we are after. But, if you would save trouble to yourself, get away from this as soon as you can. There are men here that would not mind doing you an injury. I speak as your friend.” “Will it not be safe, Thomas Crafts, for me to go to my room. I have a watch and money and private papers in my desk that I would not willingly have consumed.” “Which is your room?” “That with the blind half open.” “Describe the desk?” “Cherry wood, inlaid with brass.” “You shall not lose it if it is not now already too late to save it. Go out of the garden and keep in some place of safety, at least for twenty-four hours. If I can save the desk you will find it at my house. Take my advice and leave this at once, for I am a friend to you, though you are that man's secretary.” With these words, Crafts parted from him and hastened to the burning mansion; while Landreth, following his kind advice, retired without delay from the garden. He was hastening back to Fleming's house, when he suddenly recollected Cleverling and Saul. Not having seen the latter since he sent him after the former, he believed that he must have got possession of his person. It was but ten minutes walk to the old mill, and he therefore determined to go to it and see if Saul had fulfilled his instructions. The street in which he was terminated in an open field at a stile, from which a path led round the base of the Beacon hill to the point on the west side. Upon this point was an old mill for several years disused. A narrow footpath led to it, and seldom trodden save by boys, who used to visit the mill to rob the numerous swallows' nests that were built beneath the eves. The foot-way to it was now as light as if the full moon gave her light; and the red reflection of the distant conflagration gave it a wilder and still more desolate appearance. At length he came before it and listened to hear any sounds within. All was still. The door, broken from its hinges, gave him access to the interior, and he entered, for he thought he discerned the glimmer of a light from the second floor. He was not deceived. It shone full down the stairway upon him as he advanced. “Saul!” he called aloud. “Ah, is it you, Master Georgy?” answered the natural in a gratified voice. “I am glad you got here, Georgy, for I want to go to the fire. There never was a fire in Boston town that Saul wasn't there to see the sport. Ah, Master Georgy, its rare fun to see the flames dart and wriggle and spit and crackle and shoot up into the sky, and to hear the fire-folks holler, and the engines rattle-rattle, and see the spouts of water shoot to the top o' the roof. Come, Georgy, take him, and let Saul go to the fire.” “Have you then got Cleverling, Saul?” asked Landreth, as he placed his foot upon the upper step of the flight which he had been ascending while Saul was speaking. “Yes, and I've done my part, and you may hang him or set him a-fire, Georgy. I never learned the trade of a barber, but my work is well done,—look Georgy.” Landreth did not require to be directed to the corner of the mill, where, visible by the light of a blazing knot stuck in a crevice of a shattered mill-stone, sat an extraordinary looking object. At first he did not know what to make of it, whether to call it a man or a beast. But groans, mingled with deep curses, and the most bitter lamentations assailing his ears, he knew the object was human, and he recognized the voice as Cleverling's. His head had been closely shaven, and then covered with a coat of pitch, in which was stuck a mass of dried grass and twigs. His features were blackened and then crossed with red ochre, in stripes, like an Indian warrior's visage. A sheep skin was tied about his neck and shoulders, and the lower part of his body was encased in a long meal sack. A rope was noosed around his neck and fastened to a beam above his head. Landreth gazed upon him with pity, amazement, and a strong desire to laugh. “So, then, fiend!” cried Cleverling in a terrible voice, “you are the instigator of this! This is your work! This is your revenge! You may as well let this devil incarnate finish his work by hanging me up!” “I assure you that I authorized nothing of this kind,” answered Landreth, in tones of real commiseration at the pitiful situation in which he saw his enemy. “I wished to have you brought here that we might alone and without publicity, have our quarrel adjusted with our swords. I came here to meet you in mortal combat, for the maiden whom you would have dishonored is my betrothed bride. But this treatment you have received, I am no party to. Saul, you have done wrong.” “I have done just what he deserved. When I was shaving his head I kept sayin' Mary, and so I had no pity. I tied his head between them two beams, for he was hard to shave. I told him if he moved I'd kill him. So he was quiet, but he cried like a baby, Georgy. But I thought of Sissy Menny, and I wouldn't pity him.” “You have had punishment enough, Mr. Cleverling. You are in no situation now for me to take vengeance upon you. I am satisfied with what you have received. Severe as it is, it is no more than you deserve. It will keep you out of society two or three months, until your fine locks grow again, and I trust that the interval of retirement will be passed by you in wholesome resolutions of amendment. Saul, remove the rope, the skin and sack. If it was in my power I would restore your hair, sir, for I do not glory over a fallen foe. I would much rather have taken the matter in my own sword-hand, if Saul had not forestalled me. Shall I send a carriage for you?” asked the generous young man, kindly, as Saul took off these outward appendages. The pitch and grass were not easily removed, and he still presented a frightful spectacle about the face and head. At the command of Landreth, Saul, who was now as passive and docile as a child, went after a carriage, which he brought to the stile, where Cleverling, accompanied by the kind Landreth, met it. “Where will you go?” asked Landreth. “To Mr. Oliver's,” answered Cleverling, bitterly. “That house is in danger from the town's-people. You had best go to some inn. If you wish it, I will ride with you and speak for a room for you. My cloak you shall have to completely envelope your head and face!” “You are kind! I should like to have you go with me,” answered the wretched young man, deeply impressed with the kindness of the person he had so greatly wronged. He was completely humbled and spirit-broken. He felt not even resentment against Saul, who had caught him up as he was crossing the street near Mr. Oliver's, borne him off upon his back, and committed upon his person such hideous outrages. He felt humiliated, subdued and despicable in his own eyes. Landreth fulfilled his charitable duty by leaving Cleverling in a chamber of the inn under the care of a servant. For two months Cleverling kept his room. The act of Saul had been referred to the excesses of the populace, and in England the report went that a British officer had been tarred and feathered by the colonists from their hostility to the crown. Cleverling never unfolded the truth of the matter for his own reputation's sake; and as he got credit by his supposed sufferings in the cause of his country, there seemed no necessity for divulging the secret. He, however, was taught a good lesson by the treatment he had undergone, and in his conscience fully justified it; and ere he left the colony, three months afterwards, he voluntarily called on Mary Field, now become the happy bride of George Landreth, and making a full apology for the gross insult offered to her, asked both her forgiveness and that of her husband. In the vessel in which Captain Cleverling, for he had received promotion since his “misfortune,” sailed for London, went passengers, Mr. Hutchinson, ex-governor of the colony, his daughter, and Fleming Field. The latter went out as one of a committee of three gentlemen, for the purpose of urging the repeal of the act, and laying before the crown other affairs touching the weal and prosperity of the colonies. The stamp paper which was landed from the English ship, after having been paraded through the streets under a pall, with tolling of the bells as for a funeral, was taken to the Common and consumed amid the shouts of triumph of the multitude. There were, however, a few other bales still on ship-board, which the governor, the next day, gave up to the people; and at the same time he pledged himself not to take any steps to enforce the stamp duty until an answer could be received from the petitions about to be addressed to the crown. Such, briefly, is the history of the Stamp Act in its effects upon the people of Boston. Their example was followed by the other colonies, which united in one spirit of resistance. At length England opened her eyes, and saw before her either repeal, or the alternative of losing her colonies. The bill to repeal the obnoxious act was introduced into Parliament, and the venerable Pitt once more lifted up his influential voice in its behalf. The bill passed by a large majority, and the Stamp Act, which at one time threatened to involve the colonies in a sanguinary civil war, was repealed! The effects of this effort to bind the colonies, however, did not pass away with the annihilation of the act. A serious blow had been struck at the harmony which for a century had existed between the colonies and the mother country, and in ten years afterwards broke out the war of independence, hastened by further acts of despotic power on the part of the crown. Within the bales of the stamped paper was contained the germ of that tree of liberty whose branches overshadow twenty-eight independent States. The mission to the Court of St. James, undertaken by Fleming. Field and his coadjutors, was successful. Through their statements, and mainly through the eloquent representations of Fleming to the leading men of the House of Lords, and even before the king, with whom he had audience, the bill was introduced into Parliament and finally carried. After our hero had seen this great result achieved, he turned his heart and thoughts towards the noble maiden, whom in the bustle of political scenes he had little time to think upon. Lucy was at her father's seat in Sussex, and thither, by invitation from Mr. Hutchinson, he hastened, the second day after the repeal of the act. Here he was kindly received by the ex-governor, who had never ceased to be grateful to him for his attention and kindness at the conflagration of his mansion; and when, as the time drew near to embark for Boston, Fleming asked his daughter's hand in marriage, he did not withhold his consent, for he had been already advised of their mutual attachment through her. “Take her, young man,” said he, kindly. “You, who have twice saved her life, with mine, are certainly entitled to her!” Fleming was married a few days afterwards, and directly sailed, with his fair bride, to Boston, where his descendants now hold distinguished positions in society, and wield great influence in the councils of the republic. Landreth, after two years residence in Boston, went suddenly to England to inherit the title and estate of the Earl of Ludlow, from which he had been from early childhood defrauded through the knavery of an uncle, who had declared no such heir to exist. Thus the gentle and lovely Mary Field became the Countess of Ludlow, and her graces of character shone as brightly in her elevated sphere as they had done in her lowly estate. THE END.</field>
