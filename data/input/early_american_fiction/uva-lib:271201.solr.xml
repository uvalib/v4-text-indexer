      <field name="fulltext">Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1848, by GEORGE P. PUTNAM, In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, for the Southern District of New York. EDWARD O. JENKINS, PRINTER, 114 Nassan St., New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The following story was written prior to its very recent predecessor on the publisher's table, “The First of the Knickerbockers,” but having been prepared with more especial reference to the holidays, its publication has been deferred for the purpose of bringing it within the influence of that charmed season. This explanation is made, partly because the writer is unwilling to subject himself to the charge of offering to the public a hastily written work, and partly because he hopes to escape that closer criticism, which is usually and appropriately applied to an author's second book. The subject is one which, to New Yorkers at least, will probably not require apology. There is a charm hanging about the idea of the ancient city, and the old-fashioned populace which were identified with its peculiarities, most tempting to a vagrant pen. Moving on that distant stage, under the hazy light of an imperfect history, and looking down upon us through the vista of two hundred years, our venerated ancestors are freed, for the time, from the more rugged features which a nearer scrutiny might compel us to discern. For one, I confess to a love, more than lineal, for these worthy fathers, the founders of this great metropolis, the explorers of these majestic rivers, the hospitable, humane, generous, stubborn, obstinate “old smokers of Manhattan.” Nor for them alone, but for those gentler spirits, whose reign was over the domestic hearth, and in the social circle, and to whom pertained in a larger degree than is generally believed, those feminine graces and beauties which impart to human life so much of its poetry, and cast an air of romance over all its dull realities. Ye dear and venerated visions, voiceless, yet eloquent, who have long cheered my solitary hours, and who now go forth to meet the gaze of less partial eyes—farewell! I weep to think that ye must pass that Ithuriel band which guards the portals of literature, and that when next we meet, some of you, alas! touched by transforming wand, may be changed into “monsters and chimeras dire.” New York, December, A. D. 1848.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. More than a hundred and fifty years ago, there lived, just without the goodly city of New York, but far within its present precincts, a worthy Dutch burgher whose name was not Van Corlear. It is ventured, however, to borrow that venerable patronymic in his behalf, withholding his real name, lest some of his irascible descendants, jealous of ancestral fame, may impugn the verity of those family secrets which are about to be divulged. This prudential arrangement in relation to names is intended also to extend to the other personages mentioned in the following history; and when thus much of fiction is so frankly acknowledged, it is hoped that the reader will be therewith content, and will be willing to concede to the more material matters the credence they deserve. Whether Burleigh Van Corlear was christened after Queen Elizabeth's treasurer, or whether his baptismal name (which was usually written and pronounced Burly) was bestowed in anticipation of his future figure, it is difficult at this late day to determine. That he was both rotund and robust, that his circumference was equal to his height, and that it was no easy matter to get around him, either literally or figuratively, are points which are, fortunately, better established. Burley had at one time been an alderman of the city which now bounded him on the south; and it required only to look at him to perceive his qualifications for that office, and the faithful manner in which its duties had been discharged. His appearance, indeed, spoke a volume upon this subject. It was no small gratification, either, to Mynheer Van Corlear to remember the official honors which he had thus enjoyed, and they formed the theme of much pleasing reflection. Like many retired statesmen of later days, he was consoled for present obscruity by the consciousness of having once been 2 famous. Newspapers, indeed, were too scarce in that age to admit of any reasonable hope that he should ever see his name or titles emblazoned in print; but the time would come—he often thought of it—when they would be engraved in marble, and, suspended on a mimic scroll, by the down-reaching arms of two little fat cherubs, would proclaim to the world the dignity of his dust. Mynheer Van Corlear was third cousin to the great patroon of Kenterhook, and annually, in the season of the winter holidays, did that august personage pay a visit to his city relations. It was in the latter part of November, in the year 1689, that the household of the alderman was thrown into commotion by the receipt of a letter from the patroon, announcing his approach. He would set sail, thus the bulletin ran, on the first of December, and expected with favoring winds to arrive at the metropolis on or about the tenth of the same month. He came thus early to avoid the fatigues of a journey by land, as the advancing season would soon close the river with ice; but it was none too early for the protracted and convivial visits of those hospitable days. Great was the note of preparation at Van Corlear's, for old General Van Ness was in truth a personage not to be slighted. He was the proprietor of a princely estate on the banks of the Hudson, and his family mansion had been a landmark for nearly half a century to the navigators of that beautiful river. Wealthy almost beyond competition in the province, he was also a generous and benevolent old man, dispensing on every side his bounteous charities, and making glad the hearts of all who surrounded him. Like the latter rain were his gifts, and like the dew of Hermon the cheery smile with which he beheld and participated in the happiness he bestowed. Many a poor neighbor found his winter store of flour and meal at his door upon opening it on a Christmas morning, with no other clew to the donor than a feigned note from the merry and ubiquitous saint of the season. At times, too, tied in the mouth of the sack, like the rejected gold of Joseph's brethren, a glittering guinea greeted the glad eyes of the poverty-stricken laborer, who had passed a sleepless night in harassing thoughts of quarter-day at hand. The good old man's heart was indeed unfitted for selfish joy; nor was he willing to celebrate with unmeaning merriment alone, the day which commemorates Heaven's highest mercy to mankind. But the now anticipated visit of the patroon was to be marked by an unusual feature, for his nephew and prospective heir was to be his companion. For many years a widower, and more recently rendered childless by the loss of his only son, his paternal affection had been transferred to his sister's child, and Harry Livingston was everywhere known as the future lord of the vast domains of his uncle. He had but recently returned from a sojourn of several years in England and the Netherlands, where he had been sent for the completion of an education then considered unattainable in the colonies. These opportunities, with the additional advantages of travel, had not been lost upon a mind naturally acute and discerning, and sustained moreover by a strong substratum of good sense, and the young Livingston had returned to his native land, a well-educated and accomplished man. It need scarcely be said that he brought with him no repulsive airs, and no affected contempt of provincial life. But while these distinguished travellers are darting down the Hudson at the rate of “fifteen miles in sixteen hours,” and stopping nightly to avoid collision with a vessel which was expected to pass up the river during the same month, an opportunity will be afforded us to visit that mysterious household of the alderman, to which allusion has been made. Please, then, to drop into the clairvoyant state for a moment, gentle reader, and you shall be speedily enlightened on this subject. A few “passes,” if you please—there—thus —a moment's steady gaze of the eye—and now I think you are en rapport. And now, as the French mesmerist informed his gaping patient, I shall tell you what you shall see; to which with easy acquiescence you are expected to assent. Endwise to the street standeth the dingy yellow brick mansion of Burley Van Corlear, dated in front, in iron letters built into the wall, 1666. Essentially Dutch, “from turret to foundation stone,” its shape and proportions have evidently been fashioned after some fantastic old-world model, yet with a curious nicety of detail which speaks plainer than words its builder's faith in its being the very perfection of architecture. With two wings and a tail-like appendage, it looks not altogether unlike some huge bird which has settled heavily down upon the landscape, with ruffled pinions projecting at many points, in the shape of ill-hung window blinds, of which the one half cannot be opened, and the other half cannot be shut. An iron weather-cock, somewhat opinionated on the subject of the wind, and like its proprietor, not easily moved, surmounts the summit of the building, and its walls are decorated with little martin houses, to be let, rent free, and already hospitably open for their expected tenants. The out-buildings, arranged in the heterogeneous order, stand pointing at their principal from every direction as if in amazement at the extraordinary spectacle, while an arched and open-mouthed carriage house, on the side of the court, stares ceaselessly at it, with undisguised astonishment. But it is less with the clumsy and ungainly casket that we have to do, than with the jewels within. And jewels, indeed, there were; to say nothing of Burley himself, a precious old ruby, or of Vrow Van Corlear, a very pearl in her way, albeit in dimensions one that would have made even a Shrewsbury oyster stand agape. One more magnetic touch, one gentle pass along the temples, (start not, fair reader! those clustering curls shall not be harmed,) and these richer gems shall become visible. Look now through that open doorway which partly reveals the mysteries of a half-acre kitchen, and tell me what you see. I do not want to know about the mountain of freshly fried cookies on the hearth, or the long row of pale and unbaked mince pies on the dresser, or the depth or breadth of that Shadrach looking oven, glowing with uncommon heat for their reception. But rather—ah, yes—you see her now—crimping with white fingers the edge of the forty-second pie, and turning around with a face bewitching in its unconscious beauty, to give a laughing word to a little crowing brother on the floor. That round snowy arm, upraised in playful menace, those soft, blue, laughing eyes, those glittering teeth, revealed by “chirrups,” and that brown glossy hair, scarce kept by force from curling, are part and parcel all of sweet little Jessie Van Corlear. The golden beams of the wintry sun, streaming through the window, are bathing her beautiful form in light, and casting moving shadows upon the floor, thrice strange and wondrous to the little learner there. But Jessie has another sunlight, emanating from within, the perpetual product of a joyous and innocent heart, gilding and permeating all things with its beams. “She was made for happy thoughts, For playful wit and laughter, Singing on the hills alone, And Echo singing after.” But what other vision, equally radiant and dazzling, is this, which rises suddenly to our view? Queenly is her gait, tall and Juno-like her figure, her eyes are dark and flashing, her brow the home of Thought— while, flitting o'er her curling lip, steals that dread bane of beauty, pride. An ornament and almost a fixture of the parlor, the pride and hope of the family, the future bride, perhaps, of the heir of Kenterhook, (for to such a height did the daring ambition of Burley Van Corlear rise,) is the beautiful Gertrude. She has by no means descended to the kitchen for the purpose of assisting in its labors, nor is she expected so to do. She has come, rather, to learn the progress of affairs. Accustomed to deference, she must not be too highly blamed, but there might, methinks, be a little more of kindness in the tone of her voice as she addresses the gentle Jessie, and, it may be fancy, but there seems an air of chillness in her deportment as, rustling in silks, and shining in antique jewelry, she returns speedily to her apartment. But the mystic fluid is failing—the room grows dark—the building itself recedes, until with a twinkling motion of its last grotesque chimney, it vanishes from view, followed by its whole group of satellites.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2* CHAPTER II. As the fowler spreads his snares for the unwary bird, as the spider weaves his toils for the unconscious fly, so, saith tradition, did the belles of the seventeenth century entrap the harmless and unsuspecting beaux. But Fortune be thanked, that this cruel fashion, if ever it existed, has passed away, and that not a lady now, in all this broad land, pretends to exercise the art. The commotion caused by the expected arrival of the young patroon was far from being confined to the family of Van Corlear. Many a plump Dutch maiden in the neighborhood, and some even in the great city adjacent, were calculating the chances against the beautiful Gertrude, as they lingered, innocently enough, at the labors of the toilet. None thought of Jessie, nor did ever so treasonable an idea enter her guileless breast as that of competition with the commanding charms of her sister. She even looked forward with delight to the expected triumph of Gertrude, albeit it was a stinted measure of kindness which she might ever expect from the future lady of Kenterhook. But her good nature seemed, for once, to be fairly reciprocated. Gertrude became suddenly very kind and considerate toward her, and in the excess of her solicitude, began even to discover symptoms of impaired health in the bright blue eyes and ruby lips of her sister. A little change of air, and a respite from domestic duties, was clearly requisite for so decided an invalid, and inasmuch as old Aunt Schermerhorn, who resided in the adjacent city, had long been importuning her for a visit, Gertrude advised that the invitation should at once be accepted. Doubting and wondering much, Jessie was still too ingenuous for suspicion, and too much overjoyed at the prospect of the proposed visit to analyze motives. Her parents' permission was accordingly obtained, and she was posted off without further ceremony. But while the sagacious Gertrude had taken such pains to get rid of internal enemies, she found herself suddenly subjected to an unexpected attack from without. There were in the immediate neighborhood of the Van Corlears, three single sisters, not youthful, to whom some mischievous wag had given the appellation of “the fates”—a name which, unfortunately for them, proved as adhesive as diachylum. They were daughters of old Baltus Van Dingle, a man half as rich as the patroon himself, and they now became suddenly gracious to Gertrude, and made her some long-deferred visits, with many a condescending reason for their delay. Not the least curiosity had they about the expected guests, and when the subject was casually mentioned, they were jointly and severally surprised beyond all measure. The figures of two of these ladies belonged to the style of beauty known as the squabby, and their faces, round as a dumpling, had an expression not entirely dissimilar to that viand. The youngest—Eve by name—was tall and not a little lank, with very long and very yellow ringlets, which were taught to twine, in many a golden convolution, adown her neck. Her eyes were, in color, of an unexceptionable pea-green, but they were unfortunately somewhat at variance, and her nasal organ, a little upturned, seemed ever bent on learning the cause of the difficulty. If, however, the visual organs of Miss Eve were ill-arranged, she was favored with a corresponding mental obliquity which prevented her from discovering the magnitude of the defect. One eye, she argued to herself, was certainly true, and if the other manifested a disposition to disclaim companionship with its fellow, the aberration was too slight to attract attention. When it is further said that Miss Van Dingle's brow was always a little corrugated, probably by an ineffectual effort to keep the refractory member in position, a more adequate portraiture of this lady will be presented. But there is a wonderfully transforming power in the alembic of a vivid imagination, and, by its aid, Eve had learned to believe herself quite handsome, though certainly, as she admitted to herself that very morning, while unpinning her sixteenth blazing curl at the mirror—certainly of a different style of beauty from either of the Misses Van Corlear. The exploring party tarried long enough to glean the information for which expressly they had set out, and then took their leave with some discouraging presentiments; but they had long been taught the potency of gold, and possessing so powerful an auxiliary, they did not altogether despair. Time rolled on. The little obstinate weather-cocks, which had so long pointed pertinaciously to the south, suddenly veered about, and a fresh northerly breeze came sweeping down the river. On the wings of the wind therefore, if not on the wings of love, came the gallant young Livingston, all unconscious of the gins and pitfalls which were set for his capture. Overjoyed was Burley Van Corlear, delighted was his worthy spouse, and as glad as propriety would permit was the more discreet Gertrude, at the arrival of the guests. So boisterous in his merriment was the old patroon, and so many were the alderman's words of welcome, that both, in unison with the good dame, poured forth a long, continuous, and commingled stream of double and twisted words, to which none made the least pretence of listening or reply. But if there was an uproar of welcome within the hospitable house, there was “confusion worse confounded” without. The well-packed wagon, which had transported the guests from the city, where the sloop had found moorings, was darkened by a cloud of jabbering negroes of every age and size, making the air ring with their merriment, as they clambered upon the sides and wheels of the vehicle, and eagerly assisted to discharge its contents. Of these, while the greater part belonged to Van Corlear, a few had been attracted by the commotion from the neighboring farm-houses, and two, a little more staid and sober, yet grinning broadly, were servants of the patroon, rejoicing in the euphonious names of Josh and Squash. These last were themselves the objects of no small degree of admiration to their less favored brethren; nor did the horses, well-fed and shining, which were their especial care, fail to attract their share of attention, for restive and champing, the noble steeds manifested their delight at regaining the use of faculties, of which, on sloopboard, they had been so long restrained. The travellers, it will be seen, had judiciously provided themselves with the means of returning home by land, if their more unstable highway should become unnavigable before their visit was brought to a close. Great was the surprise of Livingston and Miss Van Corlear on being introduced to each other; for instead of the fat, dumpy, and peony-faced girl of Harry's imagination, he met an elegant and graceful lady, while she, anticipating the awkward salute of a bashful youth, found herself confronted by a gentleman, courtly, refined, and self-possessed. It will be unnecessary to dwell at any length upon the events of the few succeeding weeks. Miss Van Corlear had a clear field, and it would have been strange indeed, if, without a competitor, she could not have gained the winning-post. Harry was a student, fond of books, and fond of nature. Of human nature he was not the best judge in the world, and least of all, of that variety designated by bachelor Oldbuck as “woman-kind.” He was a Dutchman, and rather phlegmatic. But there was no resisting the perpetual recurrence of one beautiful face, the continuous harmony of one gentle and melodious voice. His books were gradually laid aside, his walks were suspended, his favorite steed, unmounted, stood stamping idly in the stable, turning his graceful neck, wistfully and oft, to look for the master that came no more. Sitting at Gertrude's side, and telling her tales of the olden world, leaning over her harp as she warbled the airs which he had taught her, reading aloud from her favorite authors, these became now the more prominent features in Harry's daily life. The fountain of his feelings had burst its icy surface, and like his native Hudson, released from its wintry chains, revealed a strong, deep, rapid current beneath. Harry was in love. In vain did the Misses Van Dingle, Goth-like, make a second irruption upon the Van Corlears. The ancient family carriage, with its fat, glossy steeds, and its grinning black driver, in vain proclaimed the aristocratic rank of the dumpling faces and the long yellow curls. Nature's aristocracy carried it clear, against the broad acres of Van Dingle; and if the visit of “the fates” had any effect, it was to enhance, by contrast, the charms of Gertrude, and thus to hasten the catastrophe which they would have averted. Harry's fate was nearer at home. Christmas came not, ere Gertrude Van Corlear, the cold, calculating, ambitious Gertrude, was affianced to the young patroon as his future bride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Christmas Holidays, which brought home every member of the family, never drew to paternal doors a more frank, generous, whole-souled, and sound-hearted youth, than Seth Van Corlear. Freshly released from academic restraint, he came bounding into the house like a fire-ball, his round red face blazing with excitement, and his large blue eyes sparkling with joy. Staying for but hasty salutations, he danced off with a little Van Corlear in each hand, to see the horses, the cows, the pigs and the poultry, and as if he had but one minute's vacation instead of three weeks, was back again in a twinkling, dashing through every room in the house, catching hold of everybody, and finally coming to a stand, only to shout long and loudly for Jessie. Great was his surprise and grief to learn that his favorite sister was absent at such a time. Although himself within his minority, he was still two years the senior of Jessie, and considered himself in some degree the guardian of her interests, as he had been in boyhood her champion and defender. If his affection for her was ever full and overflowing, it was perhaps owing partly to the fact that its channel in another direction had been long since obstructed. His monitor, his task mistress, the informant against his boyish peccadilloes—these were the unfavorable lights in which Memory ever placed his elder sister, and there had been but little in the deportment of her later years to regain the fraternal affection which had been so early estranged. That she had been in some way the cause of Jessie's absence, was a suspicion which at once forced itself upon his mind with all the strength of conviction. Bitter and burning, therefore, was his shame for Gertrude, but more bitter and more burning was his indignation. His dear, his gentle, his pretty Jessie, whom, in sportive mood, he had so often styled the future bride of Kenterhook, had been spirited away by a jealous sister, at the very moment when all his brilliant visions in her behalf might have been realized. And might they not yet? Learning for the first time to dissemble his thoughts and feelings, he became a vigilant observer of Livingston and Gertrude. But there was as yet no openly avowed engagement of the lovers, and there was but little to mark the intimate nature of their relation. Seth, indeed, saw nothing. In ecstacies with the belief that all was yet safe, he took every occasion adroitly and with seeming inadvertence to sound the praises of his absent favorite, and within a few days gained the parental permission to terminate her exile. Flitting across the crackling snow, behind two noble steeds, whose hot breath smokes upon the air, behold him now hastening to the city, his merry sleigh-bells chiming with the music of his sanguine heart. Hark to that last emphatic crack of his whip, as dashing gallantly up, he stops suddenly at old Aunt Schermerhorn's well remembered door; and see where, bounding down the steps, across the side-walk, and into the very sleigh, Jessie throws her arms about his neck, her warm curls brushing his frosted cheek, while the frighted steeds start and stand trembling at a sound that minds them of the falling thong. Short was the visit of the restless youth. In a few brief hours, with Jessie at his side, cloaked and muffed and tippeted well nigh to suffocation, he was starting for home, under a perfect shower of prudential admonitions from a spare, spectacled old dame at the door, who foresaw a whole catalogue of accidents in a two miles drive across the snow. Not a whisper, however, did he breathe into his sister's ear on the subject which lay so near his heart. He descanted, indeed, upon the many merits of Livingston, and described his person and his manners, and when his laughing listener, utterly thoughtless of self, hinted her suspicions, and indeed her hopes, in regard to Gertrude and her guest, Seth did not hesitate to scout the idea as entirely unfounded. Not a little astonished at this, Jessie became perhaps a shade more thoughtful during the remaining part of their ride; but she would not own to herself, and she would have died at the stake before she would have confessed to another, the thoughts which had thus been forced upon her mind. Her brother's conduct, his praises of Livingston, his decrial of Gertrude, she now understood them all, and her heart fluttered until she feared that Seth would hear its pulsations. Cordial indeed was her reception at home, and from no one more so, than from the good old patroon, who chided her roundly for her prolonged absence. As for Livingston, in every word, in every look did he betray his admiration of the beautiful little fairy. It is true that he looked upon her as a sister, but there was a natural empressement in his manner when addressing a lady, of which he was unaware. Although his engagement to Gertrude was unknown in the family, he never for a moment doubted that she had confided the secret to her sister. But Gertrude had no confidants, and, ever selfish and unfeeling, she either did not notice Jessie's danger, or noticed it only to count on her own approaching triumph. As the good-natured but blundering zeal of Seth had originated, so did it continue to foster an error which daily became more portentous. But let us not dwell upon the painful particulars that mark the yielding up of fresh, pure, generous affections, in response to the misunderstood kindness of a heart equally noble and equally pure. Christmas came, and a merry Christmas it was. It was cold without, and the snow lay deep upon the ground, and a million of feathery flakes were sporting leisurely in the air, whether falling or rising the eye could scarcely tell. It was cold without, but the Christmas fire, built at dawn, was blazing cheerily within, where, deposited deep in the capacious chimney, a section of a centennial oak upheld the glowing, crackling, roaring pile. The little folks, half clad, or with their garments tucked beneath their arms, were rushing gleefully from their rooms to gain their plethoric stockings, and gloat over the now disgorged treasures, which had floated, night-long, before their imaginations, with all the flitting colors of the kaleidoscope. And firmly faithful in their invisible friend, the good, old, undying Santa Claus, they were next seen eagerly searching for his traces on the chimney side, or rushing, with a shout, to see the foot-prints of his tiny steeds upon the roof, which, alas, the falling snow had already effaced. Nor were they alone happy. Joy sat on every countenance, and the “Merry Christmas” salutation rang from every quarter, as the family, assembled early in the breakfast-room, discussed the past, or planned approaching festivities. There, towering on the old misshapen sideboard, rose the huge pile of cakes, embossed with strange devices, awaiting the calls of troops of rosy-cheeked children from abroad. There was a jingling, too, of many sixpences in the capacious pockets of the patroon, who looked eagerly and often from the windows, and wondered why the little rogues did not come. He had not long, however, to wait, for the first detachment of light infantry, as he loved to call them, was early on its way. Ploughing, knee-deep, through the snow, their wild laughter ringing through the clear cold air, as each strove to be foremost, bursting headlong into the house, with blazing cheeks and frosted locks and large sparkling eyes, thus did they come, a blithesome and a joyous band; and soon, laden with their anticipated gifts, hastened away to storm some other citadel, equally well prepared for the expected attack. The holidays were marked, as usual, by a joyous round of wintry amusements. At the top and the bottom, and in the midst of every scheme of merriment and fun, the life of every party, and the favorite of all, save one, was Seth. But brief was his dream of delight. The delusion into which he had run, and which he had imparted to his ingenuous sister, could not, fortunately, be of long continuance. Words may not paint the deep mortification of Jessie, her self reproach, her bitter, burning grief, when the fatal truth became apparent. Duplicity, she knew, formed no part of Livingston's character, and she readily perceived the mistake under which he had acted. But if her anguish was at first severe, it was in no small degree alleviated by the belief, nay the certainty, that he had never suspected her sentiments. This conviction, indeed, was the removal of a mountain-like weight from her mind. She was spared that last dreadful blow to a sensitive and modest maiden, the consciousness that one who loved her not, knew himself to be the object of her regard. But Jessie did not pine. Every sentiment of duty, and of self-respect, bade her forget her transient error, and conceal its traces from others. Seth alone suspected the truth and although his very efforts to seem unconscious of it, betrayed his thoughts to his sister, what did she care for dear kind Seth? Not from him would she have feared censure or doubt, had she been as deserving of these as she was of the smiles of Heaven, which even then, through the clouds that enveloped her, were resting upon her guileless heart. And what during all this time were the thoughts 3 and feelings of Gertrude. Still selfish, proud, and aspiring, suspicious of Jessie, scornful to Seth, and but simulating a regard for him whose love for her was only less than adoration, Gertrude Van Corlear was prepared to plight, before the altar of Truth, a false and perjured faith. Ah! it is a sad thing to behold a bright and beautiful spirit, severing the golden links that connect it with Infinite Beneficence, and descending by the acquired gravity of earthly passions, from even the slight moral elevation of poor human nature. But the time for the departure of the guests drew nigh, and the betrothal of Harry and Gertrude was at length openly avowed. It met with the full approbation of parents and uncles, and the cause was duly set down in Hymen's calendar for the ensuing May, the intervening time being considered requisite for the bride elect to make her multitudinous arrangements. Ever cheerful, the old patroon was in ecstasies at a result which he had long secretly anticipated; he had a good word for all, and to the delighted children he promised another round of holidays in the spring. “As for our pretty bridesmaid,” said the garrulous old man, seizing the slightly tremulous and wax-like hand of Jessie, “the next ship shall carry orders for a dress of pearly satin for her, that a princess might be proud to wear.” Hurried thanks, and a sunny smile, rewarded the old man's kindness, but whiter than the promised robe turned Jessie. Harry and Seth had formed an intimacy which promised perpetuity, and had spent many a merry hour together in the woodland, scouring over “brake, bush and brier,” in pursuit of the game, which then abounded in regions that are now well nigh central of the great metropolis. Seth had meanwhile found many an opportunity to recount the merits of his pet, but maintained a pertinacious silence whenever the young patroon hinted at the more magnificent charms of her sister. The young friends parted with regret, but with the anticipation of many a merry day's sport together in the forests of Kenterhook. Yet pleasing as were those hopes, there was nothing that could compensate Seth for his bitter disappointment. He knew the ungentle temper of his elder sister too well to expect anything like happiness for his friend from the anticipated union, and he grieved alike for Harry, for Jessie, and for himself. Why was it, he vainly asked, as the departing guests faded from his sight, why was it, when the elements of happiness might have been so easily mingled for each, that the bitter and brimming cup of grief was to be substituted in its stead? The vessel in which the visitors had journeyed to the city had, of course, long since returned, and the river was closed with ice. They returned in the family carriage which they had brought with them, taking advantage of the January thaw for that purpose, which then, as now, occurred with sufficient uniformity to be a matter of almost accurate calculation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The imperious Gertrude, relieved from the restraint imposed by the immediate presence of Livingston, no longer set limits to her pride. Her sister had daily to bear some new variety of contumely, and as for poor Seth, his would have been a slight discernment indeed, if he had not read in every glance that encountered him from the bride elect, the simple mental element of contempt. In vain did his generous spirit fret and chafe to contemplate the sumptuous preparations which were making for the approaching nuptials. In vain did he quarrel with Jessie for lending so willing a hand in furtherance of a match, which, wherever it may have originated, he stoutly contended was never made in Heaven. Old Burley meanwhile groaned under the daily exactions levied upon his purse, but consoled himself for his diminishing guilders, by the rising honors of his family. “Donner and blitzen, Getty!” would the old man exclaim, his looks really expressing the last degree of alarm, “her you come again for money?” But Getty condescended to no explanations; but with the slightest perceptible smile, and not the slightest curl of a scornful lip, replied only that she must have it. And have it she did, no matter what denials or privations it occasioned the less distinguished members of the family. The alderman's purse was, indeed, none of the longest, and he began to look forward with some anxiety to the time when he should get so expensive a piece of property off his hands. But Spring, beauteous Spring, began to give token of her approach. The venturous red-breast was her earliest herald; the tiny blue-bird soon followed in its path; the swallow began to caracole through the air; and the little daisy, wakened, perhaps, by their voices, peeped timidly from the earth. Coquettish April came, like her fickler type, dispensing alternating smiles and frowns, now making bright skies the prelude to a storm, now threatening wrathful gusts, only to burst forth in sunlight, or dissolve in tears. “Thirty days later from Albany,” were the eye-catching words, paraded at column-head of a digny, diminutive newspaper, issued at this period; and following this startling announcement was a long account of an overland express, two months from Oswego, through the Genesee country, and giving tidings of the pending troubles with the French. But the vessel which brought this important intelligence, and which now lay at the wharf, thronged by the curious, was the bearer also of despatches from Kenterhook, where it had put in for provisions and repairs. The great family seal of General Van Ness was easily recognized upon the neat-looking packet which was put into Burley's hands, addressed to “Ye Honorable Burleigh Van Corlear, whilom Alderman of New York.” “Reet it again,” said the old man, as Seth announced the pompous superscription. Seth gravely repeated the address. “Dat ish very goot,” said Burley, lowering his pipe, after a moment's reflection; “dush he say anything elsh?” Seth proceeded to open the missive, and found something else within decidedly more to the point, that is to say, that the great patroon and his nephew were about to embark for the city, and were to be looked for from the first to the fifteenth of May inclusive. But the letter also told of the serious indisposition of the general, and that he would not venture upon the voyage but for the advantage afforded by the vicinity of the city in procuring medical advice. This was really afflicting news to Van Corlear and his kind-hearted vrow, the latter of whom, however, “warranted” that she could cure him. The poor old man, she said, knew nothing about coddling himself; the doctors might be hanged, as she had known more than one to be in her day, and she began to enumerate a list of herbs on hand, of which one would be certain to cure him, if another failed, although, to be sure, she did not yet know whether his disease was the gout, the measles, or St. Vitus's dance. But the letter proceeded to say that the patroon desired the wedding to take place as soon after his arrival as possible, for he thought, benevolent old man, that the very sight of so much joy would infuse new life into his veins. They came. It was on one of the brightest mornings in May that the manly and noble-looking Livingston might have been seen, with earnest solicitude, assisting his feeble relative to alight from a carriage at Van Corlear's door. No noisy salutations now welcomed his approach. The family, indeed, thronged to the carriage, anxious to learn how much to hope or fear in his behalf; but he who had seen the good dame rush smilingly out, and catching a distant glimpse of the invalid's face, stop midway, and return silently to the house, with her apron at her eyes, would have needed little other information than that simple gesture. But if his friends looked sad, the patroon himself was still merry. His unfavorable appearance, indeed, was partly owing to the fatigues of travel, and after a little rest, and some of the good vrow's doses, and the still better medicine for him, of smiling faces and cheerful words on every side, he began to exhibit a returning vitality that gave promise of better things. The carriage, which had approached the door with a slow and hearse-like motion, was immediately seen dashing away at a fearful speed, for Seth was within, despatched express by Livingston for the city's most eminent physician. Nor was Doctor Schwackhammer tardy 3* in obeying the summons to the bedside of the distinguished patient, who had travelled so far to obtain the benefit of his advice. He was an old practitioner, to whom half of the existing population of the island had been indebted for assistance at quite too early a period of their lives to admit of their appreciating the favor, and to whom many of their cotemporaries were under unspeakable obligations for a somewhat hasty exodus from this troublesome world. The doctor was older even than the patroon, and he consequently saw no evidence of natural decay in his patient. There was no breaking up of the constitution, not a bit of it. There was a little of one disease, and a slight touch of another, and some symptoms of a third, but altogether the eminent physician thought he would be a great deal better on the next day, provided he had a good night's rest, and had no bad turns. And so he was. The hushed voices of the children were changed, on the morrow, to gleeful tones, and merriment was again the order of the day. The wedding was now in every mouth, and was arranged for the first of the ensuing week. Harry Livingston was a happy man. His own heart was full of all noble emotions, and he easily discovered the same qualities in one to whom they were as foreign as flowers to the iceberg. There was indeed a winning beauty in the expression of Gertrude's soft, dark eyes, as they rested upon her fascinated lover, and a thrush-like melody in the tone of her voice, although one might have taken many a safer wager, than that she was not at those very moments calculating how soon it would be prudent to broach the subject of a fashionable house in town. “You will surely return with us,” said Livingston, addressing Jessie, “and aid to cheer up our poor uncle. The magnificent scenery of the river, of which you have so often heard, ought, of itself, to be a sufficient inducement.” Jessie hesitated to reply, but the considerate Gertrude came to her relief. “I fear that dear sister,” she said, “can hardly be spared from home; it would be indeed cruel to leave our kind parents to the tender mercies of Seth, and the other children.” “Let Seth also go with us,” rejoined Harry; “he will find abundance of game in our forests, of every variety; even deer and moose are not scarce.” “Seth's vagrant propensities are already sufficiently developed, I fear,” was Gertrude's reply, “and need no such encouragement; besides which, he will certainly be needed at home.” Seth heard this conversation, and for once his ready smile took somewhat of a hyenal cast. His spirits had gone up to fever heat on the mention of the deer and moose, and had sunk as suddenly to zero, under the cold-water treatment of his sister. But he was not quick at repartee, and he quietly swallowed the affront, for the amiable Gertrude had taught him to perform some remarkable feats in that kind of deglutition. Livingston continued to urge his wishes in regard to Jessie, confident that her society would be invaluable to his uncle; but the subject was postponed for future consideration. The great day came. The patroon's continued illness had in some measure frustrated the design of having a large party; but there were such quantities of good things prepared to be eaten and drunk, and carried away, that it was absolutely necessary to have somebody come. There were some relations, too, whom it would not do to slight. A few were therefore invited from fear and a few from affection. The Van Dingles were asked out of spite. They came, too, from the same laudable motive, for if anybody could pick flaws, and make surmises, and hint dark inuendos of shadowy suspicions, it was “the fates.” The bride might look to her dress, for if there was a crease in the flowing satin, the world would know it. But Gertrude was above criticism both in person and apparel, and that she herself was not unconscious of this fact her deportment very plainly proclaimed. Jessie, too, who had donned the magnificent robe which the patroon, mindful of his promise, had presented to her, Jessie was faultless in her beauty. Not lynx-eyed malice itself could have whispered aught against the perfect charms of the little Houri. The budding moss-rose, the daisy, the dew-drop, the sunbeam, all things bright and beautiful in nature, were emblems of Jessie. So at least thought Harmon Van Dingle, a wilted bachelor brother of the fates, who, his own word for it, had been “turned of thirty” any time within the last fifteen years, and who had begun seriously to contemplate the idea of sharing his future patrimony with the pretty bridesmaid. Everybody knows that Cupid follows in the train of Hymen to select new victims. Ill-natured people might say, indeed, that part of his errand is to reclaim the darts which he had implanted in the breasts of the married pair, and for which they would have no further use. At any rate, the little archer was present on this occasion, fully equipped, and his shafts flew in more directions than one; for the youngest Miss Van Dingle was observed to gaze tenderly and oft at the ruddy cheeks of Seth, who was unfortunately too busily engaged in looking daggers at a costly necklace of the bride elect, to observe his conquest. For Gertrude was already present. There was no parade of an imposing entrée of the bridal party, with the rustling of silks and a gale of perfumery. Quietly awaiting the arrival of the clergyman, who made it a point of dignity to be a few minutes behind his time, the family and visitors were seated about the room, chatting as yet with a little restraint. In a large easy chair, eligibly posted to command a view of the ceremony, sat the patroon. He was wan of face, but his bright beaming eye seemed to give token of returning health. If there had been any limit to his stock of smiles and good wishes, they would have been long ago expended; but the fountain was inexhaustible, and poured forth its generous streams as freshly as ever. His eyes rested frequently with a patriarchal expression upon Harry and Gertrude, but occasionally strayed past them, through an open window beyond, and onward to the cloudless skies. There were noiseless motions, too, of his lips, and a calm assurance on his face, which spoke of hopes and communings far away from earth. The clergyman was at length announced, and reannounced, alas, in the sudden pallor of poor Jessie's face. Giddy and faint, her heart flutters and stands still, and starts again with a labored and violent motion. One eye only observes her distress, and turns hastily away. Ah, unhappy Seth! these are thy doings. But she soon became calm, the color returned to her cheeks, and she faltered no more. There was a little further delay, and then the clergyman arose, and the bride and the groom, and Seth and Jessie at their side, and a silence deep and breathless prevailed. Deep and breathless, and broken only by the chirp of the swallow, as he darted past the open window, and the hum of the noisy bee, loitering among the flowering vines on the porch. But at this moment, a faint scream issued from the lips of Jessie, and darting past the priest, she knelt at the old patroon's chair, and caught his hand within her own. His head had dropped upon his chest, his eyes were quietly closed, and his spirit was in Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. May had passed away, with her early flowers, and June began to tinge with a deeper green the forests and the fields. The blossoms of Spring had fallen, and the reddening cheeks of the cherries, those first rich fruits of the year, told that the warm breath of Summer was playing among the trees. All things were as blithe and beautiful without, as if the wings of the angel of Death had never overshadowed the land, or rather, as if the spirits of the good departed from their earthly frames, only to diffuse themselves among the birds, the sunlight, and the flowers. In a small but handsomely furnished room in the mansion of the late General Van Ness, gazing through an open window at the beautiful scenery without, sat Seth Van Corlear. Before him, around him, and on every side, were books; shelves lined with books, extended half way around the room, and books, maps, and papers lay strewn about the floor. Seth was usually but little fond of retirement, and seemed scarcely at home, seated thus in the study of Livingston, at whose request he had gone to Kenterhook to take a general superintendence of affairs during the absence of its new proprietor. The heir, who had been so suddenly transformed from a dependent to a millionaire, had resolved not to return to his estates until the ensuing autumn, when the nuptials, which had been so sadly broken off, were to be celebrated, and he might bring back smiles and joy to his now desolate house. The family vault of the Van Nesses was in the city of New York, and there the remains of the late patroon had been deposited. He had left no will, because without it, the law itself devolved his large property upon his nephew, who was his only near relation. Seth spent a portion of his time in visiting some of the nearer tenantry, and occasionally making an excursion into the interior to call some remote delinquent to account. Of amusement he was in no lack, for the forests on every side were alive with game, and the antlers of many a noble stag, posted conspicuously about the room, proclaimed his prowess in the chase. But latterly he had seemed more disposed to quietude and reflection, and he would sit for hours in the study, gazing out of the window, with an unheeded book open before him, and with a sad and half-angry expression upon his face. But Seth's eyes no longer rest upon the distant river, nor on the more distant hills, nor on the high-piled snowy clouds floating buoyantly above them. He is looking now upon eyes that seem to return his gaze, from within a large gilded frame on the opposite side of the room. It is a portrait of the late patroon, and at its side, in smaller compass, is a likeness, also, of the blooming lad of fourteen, who ten years before had left the paternal roof, never to return. He had been sent abroad, as Livingston subsequently was, for the completion of his education, and after four years of absence, had embarked for home in a vessel which was soon after totally wrecked. The particulars of his fate were not known by his relations, for although the late patroon was supposed to have had minute information of all the facts, the subject was one, doubtless by reason of its exceedingly painful interest, on which he seldom spoke. Long and thoughtfully did Seth gaze at the pictures; frowns gathered upon his brow, and smiles succeeded, and his bright blue eyes now flashed with merriment, and now grew serious in doubt. Anon he started suddenly from his chair and rapidly traversed the room, uttering disjointed sentences, and occasionally stopping before the portraits and looking up as if he expected a reply. More boisterous still became Seth. His red face grew redder, he walked the room more rapidly, he rubbed his large hands together, and finally brought one of them down upon his leg with a slap that made the very windows tremble. He next proceeded deliberately to take the dimensions of the smaller frame, and having committed them to writing, he left the house. When he next returned to the study, he brought with him a shallow wooden case, opening with hinges, and secured with a lock and key. In this he carefully deposited the portrait of the lad, locked it, pocketed the key, and again sat down to reflect. On the next day, he announced to the surprised domestics, that he was about leaving home, for an absence of ten or twelve days; and many a secret conclave was held among the sable gentry to discuss his destination. They could make nothing of it, however, excepting that he must be going clear up to the great city of Albany, a place which, although less than thirty miles distant, was to the oldest of them an object of faith rather than of sight. The best horses and the best wagon were, however, prepared with great alacrity for the momentous expedition, and old Aunt Dinah, fearful of famine by the way, made her appearance at the moment of starting, laden with a large and snugly packed basket of provisions. “It's ony a bite,” she gravely replied to Seth's remonstrances, meaning thereby, as appeared on future inspection, three several hams, half a score of mince pies, and cakes untold. Seth had succeeded in transferring his mysterious looking box to the wagon without observation, and had secured the study from any intrusion during his absence, lest the portrait should be missed. Whistling and singing, chirruping to the horses, and occasionally shouting to fright some distant crow from his perch, or scare the scampering squirrel to its nest, he dashed merrily along through the still and echoing forest. His course was northward, and his immediate destination, as had been rightly conjectured, was Albany. In this venerable Dutch city resided several families distantly connected with the late patroon, whom he did not hesitate to visit. That he was a Van Corlear, was a sufficient introduction for him everywhere among the friendly mynheers; but Seth was not disposed to trespass long upon the hospitalities of any. In vain did the buxom maidens dart their sly glances at his sunny face, and vainly did their more worldly mothers hint at munificent dowries, with the brindled cow thrown in. Seth was proof against all such gentle blandishments. His chief attention, on the contrary, seemed given to the grown-up sons of the family. With these he took pains to win favor, and while he praised the horses and the sweet-hearts which divided their affection, he looked narrowly into their faces, and watched closely their deportment. From these interviews, he would go directly to his wagon, unlock his carefully concealed casket, and gaze long and earnestly at the treasure within. Thus did he visit and inspect all the families in the city, who claimed any consanguinity, however remote, with the late patroon, but from his last examination, as from his first, he turned away with a saddened and disappointed air. Coarse features and coarser frames, white heads, thick necks and bandy legs—these were among the pleasing reminiscences of his new-found friends, which floated continually before his mind. He had not yet learned that remarkable physiological fact, that in the Dutch races, the family beauty and grace, like the family plate, all descend in the female line. But on more minute inquiry, he heard that there was still another family, bearing the name of Van Ness, living far up toward the Champlain country, which last named region was then generally supposed to be the territory lying immediately around the North Pole. Their place of residence was some twenty miles north of the ancient town of Schagticoke, a name which, however barbarous to the outside Yankees, is dear to many a Dutch ear. The polar Van Ness, too, was said to be a very near relation of the late general, their fathers having been first cousins. Nothing daunted by the magnitude of the journey, young Van Corlear bade his Albanian friends farewell, and without informing them of his course, crossed to the eastern side of the river, and struck out boldly into the northern wilderness. His winding road, but half redeemed from the surrounding wilds, led through primeval forests dark and tangled, where now, rivalling the modern capital, and a very thorn in her side, stands the beauteous city of Troy, well worthy of her classic name, and where long Lansingburgh out-stretched, adorns the river's side. Opposite to Half Moon Point, he paused awhile to witness the confluence of the mighty Mohawk with its northern sister, and to meditate upon the unrevealed mysteries of that far western world, through which its silvery tide had rolled. With what an air of life and freshness did it come, that bright and sparkling flood, alive with the impetus of its leap at the cataract of the Cahoes, and singing its wild song of freedom, and its lays of forest chivalry and love. There were curling columns of smoke that told of wigwam life upon the point, which overlooked those mighty rivers, where now a dreamy spell-bound town exists, like some enchanted city of the Past, where men grow gray in the simplicity of childhood, and are disbelievers in the progress of the age. Omitting a record of the perils which beset the solitary traveller, let us see him next, again a welcome guest in a hospitable family, of which, until the preceding day, he had never so much as heard. His hopes, whatever they were, revived as he beheld the multitudinous progeny that surrounded the hearth— aye, the house, and the barn, for that matter—of Bartholomew Jacobus Van Ness. As before, however, his attention was chiefly bestowed upon the young men of the family, of whom there were not a few, and more and more did his spirits rise, as he conversed severally with these, and still made his mysterious visits to his concealed picture. But he learned, on inquiry, that there was yet one whom he had not seen. This was Derick, the eldest of the sons, who was absent on a hunting excursion; and Seth, having inquired the direction he had taken, immediately set out in pursuit. He was not long in coming up with the sportsman, the very first glance of whom made his merry eyes sparkle with delight. He was tall, well-formed, and graceful in his deportment, presenting a striking contrast to his obese and awkward cousins. But on a sufficiently near approach to look into the countenance of the young Van Ness, Seth's ecstasy no longer knew any bounds. His smiles deepened into a grin, as he first stared silently in the stranger's face 4 and then proceeded to dance around him and inspect him on every side. Derick gazed with a droll and puzzled look at his visiter, who, still completely abstracted, was coolly proceeding to examine him next by the sense of feeling, but a significant gesture of the other partly recalled him to his senses. “Never mind,” said Seth, apologetically, “it's all the same, you'll do;” which last two words he continued slowly to repeat at intervals of a few seconds, while reperusing the features of his companion. Never doubting that he was dealing with a madman, Derick stood a little upon his guard, and returned the other gaze for gaze. But when Van Corlear's excitement had partly subsided, he politely apologized for his rudeness, and having cordially shaken hands with the huntsman, they were in a few minutes seated together at the foot of a huge tree, engaged in earnest conversation. Whatever may have been the subject under discussion, it was evidently one which pleased them both mightily. Seth, however, now kept himself under restraint, although his body seemed to have parted with all its natural gravity. Like the pith-ball “witches” of children, held forcibly upon the wrong end, he seemed continually about to bound upward and turn a somerset. His nervous grasp upon a projecting root of the tree favored this supposition, and conveyed the idea that he was holding himself down. Derick was about twenty-five years of age, jovial to an excess, and fond of every variety of adventure. His inner man was but little indebted to education, but he was quick-witted, had good natural parts, and a head that was never hazy. When their forest conference was ended, they returned immediately homeward, and went privately to the wagon of Van Corlear, where the latter unlocked his box and displayed its contents to his companion. Much did they marvel and chuckle, but at what more particularly, tradition doth not say. On the next morning, after another long and secret conference with Derick, Seth bade his hospitable friends adieu, and started for home, where he safely arrived on the third day, having made the most formidable inroads by the way upon Aunt Dinah's store of provisions, to the no small delight of the good-natured slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. It was about six weeks subsequent to the occurrence of the events last related that a gentleman with a decidedly foreign air, and wearing a heavy moustache, called at the mansion of the patroon, and inquired for General Van Ness. He seemed greatly afflicted on hearing of his death, and dismounting from the jaded steed which had evidently borne him no small distance, demanded to know who was in possession of the house. He was surrounded, by this time, by a circle of awe-stricken negroes, whose huge platter eyes were distended to the last extent, while a brood of monkey-like children were peering through the interstices, looking, if possible, still more astonished and alarmed. The hoarse croak of old Jake at length found utterance sufficient to reply, in behalf of the company, that they didn't any of them know anything there, but that Massa Seth was in yender and could tell the gemman everything. “And who the d—l,” said the fierce-looking foreigner, forgetting his grief, and frightening his whole auditory a step or two backward, “who the d—l is Massa Seth? Is there no one here to welcome Bleecker Van Ness back to his father's house, after ten long years of absence?” Old Jake, on hearing this adjuration, ran up and gave one eager gaze into the stranger's face, and then stood mouthing horribly at him, without voice, while every joint in his old palsied frame shook with agitation; Aunt Dinah performed a feat never before recorded of any of her race—she fainted outright, and fell like a feather-bed upon the ground; while the rest of the troop ran pell-mell in every direction, some shouting, “A spook!” and others that the day of judgment had come. Attracted by the turmoil, Seth made his appearance first at the window, and then descended into the court, where, having hastily reproved the slaves, who had rallied in the distance, he turned courteously to the stranger, and inquired the cause of the alarm. The latter at once assumed a more lofty air, and glancing at the servants who were again clustering around him. replied that their affright could scarcely be considered a matter of surprise. “I,” he continued, “am Bleecker Van Ness, the only son and rightful heir of the late patroon of Kenterhook. How long shall I stand, sir, surrounded by menials, awaiting a stranger's invitation to enter my own doors?” Hurriedly apologizing by saying that astonishment had held him speechless—for very much amazed was Seth—he immediately led the way into his study, which both having entered, he locked and double-locked the door; but conscious that the listening negroes were already piled three tiers deep on the outside, he at once conducted the stranger across the room into an adjoining bed-room. The door of this apartment he also hastily closed, and then turned upon his visiter a face bearing the marks of the last stages of suffocation. “You'll do,” he said, “you'll do,” chuckling and choking as he grasped the hand of the other, and then, throwing himself upon the bed, he buried his face in the pillow, and shook like a stranded grampus. “Don't you think I'm rather too dark?” said the stranger, looking in the mirror at his sun-burnt features. “By no means,” replied Seth; “why, man, haven't you been six years a prisoner in Algiers?” “Oh, aye, I forgot that—so I have—and deuced hot work it was, too, toiling on the quays under that broiling sun.” “Of course it was,” said Seth. The two friends now sat down for further conference and consultation, and for many days succeeding, they were busily engaged together, at times poring over maps and charts, and at times perusing books of travels. The stranger proved an apt scholar, and with Seth's aid, soon acquired a valuable addition to his stock of useful knowledge. The delighted slaves readily recognized him as their young master, and he, in turn, remembered them all, not excepting some youngsters of nine or ten years. The new patroon did not, however, deem it prudent to make any very extensive draughts as yet upon the allegiance of his surrounding tenantry. His modesty indeed extended so far, that he even denied himself for the present to the few visiters whom the rumor of his unexpected advent attracted to his house. But in the presence of Seth and the domestics he was more pretending, and seemed desirous of practising some of those airs of authority and station which his future dignities might require him to exhibit, and which would indicate to the observer that he had been “to the manor born.” “Look at dat now,” exclaimed the sable Josh, half surlily, and half in admiration, as booted and spurred, and flourishing a fanciful riding-whip, his young master made his appearance, and after much scolding at the imperfect grooming of his horse, (or rather of Livingston's choicest steed,) mounted and rode dashingly off—“jes look at dat—he aint rubbed down, aint he? and he shining like beeswax all over. But golly gosh!” continued the negro after a pause, with his eyes fixed wonderingly on the flying steed, “how Massa Bleecker do ride—how stiddy he set—see him go, Quash—cross de bridge—over de creek—troo de grove—by jingo! Massa Harry no ride like dat, any how; yhah! yhah! yhah!” and an echoing plaudit arose from the whole sable fraternity. “That is really a very respectable sort of an animal,” exclaimed the new patroon when, after an hour's absence, he had returned at the same rapid pace, and dismounted among the officious slaves, where Seth also chanced to be present; “quite respectable for this new country, but you should mount a real Barbary once, Mr. Van Corlear, to know what riding is—a coal-black Barbary, with head erect and flying mane, and flashing eyes, and flaring nostrils, and feet that you'd swear didn't touch the ground once in—” An expressive glance from Seth interrupted this beautiful rhapsody, and brought it to a rather lame termination. “Not that I ever rode one myself, of course, being a prisoner there,” continued the other, “but I've seen the Moors ride, you know, very often.” “You'll do,” repeated Seth, once more, sotto voce, as followed by the admiring eyes of the negroes, the friends withdrew into the house; “You'll do—but—I say!” “What, Seth?” “Do you know what is in that formidable looking box, locked and strapped and cased in canvass?” 4* “Certainly not.” “Nor I,” replied Van Corlear, smiling; “but it came from London about six weeks ago; the ship that brought it had a long passage, or it would have arrived before the time which was set for Harry's marriage last spring. As it is—” “He knows nothing of its arrival?” “Nothing—and cares less.” “It may be placed in my room,” was the grave reply. “This is the key, I think; there are doubtless some articles of wearing apparel which will require airing;—in fact, now that I reflect upon it, I believe I ordered these things myself, just before I left London;—it's all right—all right.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “Come, Jessie, it is not necessary to be so very particular in arranging your curls; it is not your beau, I believe, who is expected.” The amiable Gertrude had never forgiven her sister for her fascinating appearance as bridesmaid, and occasionally amused herself now by taunting her with the futility of her charms in obtaining admirers. “Though, to be sure,” she continued, “Harmon may possibly come, for I saw him passing but this instant on horseback, with a bag of meal for a saddle. He is a gallant cavalier, Jessie, and I caught him in the very act of casting a tender glance this way, just as his steed caracoled away.” Had not Harmon Van Dingle actually made some awkward and indirect advances to Jessie; had not old Baltus and Burley smoked seventeen pipes on the subject, and settled the whole matter to their perfect satisfaction, only to be indignantly vetoed by the little beauty; had it not been for these things, Gertrude's unfeeling joke would have had but little effect. As it was, Jessie's blood for once boiled with wrath, for you have been mistaken, gentle reader, if you have supposed that Jessie Van Corlear was altogether an angel. There are in reality no angels among mortals, at least there were none returned in the census of New York in the year 1690. But Jessie well knew that she was no match, either in coolness or sarcasm, for her practised sister, and she wisely refrained from entering the lists against such unfavorable odds, contenting herself with shedding a few bitter tears, and wondering seriously for the fiftieth time, what enormous crime she had been guilty of, to draw down upon her head such accumulated misery. It was about the middle of October, and Livingston, who had spent the summer chiefly in travel in some of the more southerly provinces, was expected home on that day, and it was in allusion to his return that Gertrude's first remark had been made. But her agreeable anticipations were disappointed. The mail stage from Philadelphia, which came in punctually every other Saturday, arrived with its usual parade at the old Crown and Anchor Inn, and although it contained nearly a dozen passengers, packed with inconceivable skill, it did not bring Harry Livingston. There is undoubtedly a letter, however, thought the disappointed Gertrude, and one of the younger brothers was forthwith despatched to the city post-office. The Misses Van Dingle knew very well on what day the Philadelphia coach came in, and they knew equally well that the patroon was expected, like the rain, somewhere about these days; but whether their knowledge on these points had anything to do with a friendly call which they now made upon Gertrude, it is difficult to tell. They were daughters of Eve, and had inherited, at an immense remove, an infinitesimal portion of her curiosity; and let them not, therefore, be blamed if they were desirous to behold a sight so rare to them as a meeting between two long-separated lovers. They came—no less lynx-eyed or spiteful than usual, but a shade less lofty, for the Van Corlears were now classed among the aristocracy. The fates indeed were humbled. They felt as if the foot of the haughty Gertrude were resting perpetually upon their necks, and pressing down their very jugulars. But if they had lost a small part of their pride, the deficiency was made up by an additional supply of secret malice, so that, on the whole, the moral proportions of their minds were tolerably well preserved. The interview was rather a formal one, for they had few topics of conversation in common, but there was an ancient and very convenient custom in New York, which is now unfortunately obsolete, of talking much about the weather; so that it was considered quite allowable to tell an individual that it rained, notwithstanding he might, at the same instant, feel the proof of the fact trickling down his neck. This went a good way. And then the fates found opportunity to vent a little venom by hinting at the dreariness of living in the wilderness, and Gertrude spoke once, in the most accidental way, of her anticipated house in town. They winced then, the fates did; and they were soon after about retiring in utter discomfiture, when a shuffling and snuffling without, announced the arrival of Gertrude's penny-post extraordinary. He had brought a letter too, and Miss Van Corlear, willing to add a little to her triumph, extended her hand carelessly for the missive, remarking at the same time that Harry wrote very frequently. But on looking at the superscription, she slightly colored. “Ah, it's from that tiresome Seth,” she said, “filled of course with fox-hunts, and long yarns about Jowler and Towzer; you may read it, if you choose,” she continued, tossing the letter to Jessie, “for I certainly sha'n't.” The letter was addressed to Livingston; but as he had left word that all communications from Seth might be opened at home, Jessie did not hesitate to break the seal. Eager to hear anything from dear Seth, and vexed that he was so unceremoniously treated, her eye ran rapidly down the page. But the letter dropped suddenly from her hand, and rising to her feet she exclaimed, with a look of utter astonishment: “Bleecker Van Ness is alive, and at home!” Three shrieky exclamations were heard, and three pairs of flail-like arms were thrown up; but silent and pale as the sculptured marble, and as incapable of speech, sat Gertrude. She found a voice at length, though not seemingly her own, so hoarse and unnatural did it sound. “Bleecker Van Ness is dead,” she said, emphasizing the word, “and buried in the sea, long years ago; why will you repeat the idle tales of that vagrant Seth?” “Seth is no vagrant,” returned Jessie mildly, and extending the letter to her sister; “read here the details for yourself.” “I will not read it,” replied Gertrude, dashing the paper to the floor, and striding across the room with the air of a tragic queen; “it is false,” she said, “whoever says it; false,” glancing at the visiters, “whoever repeats it.” So saying, she went out. The fates lingered only long enough to assure Jessie that they thought there must be some mistake about it—indeed they sincerely hoped so, and thought, for their part, that nothing at all had better be said on the subject for the present; and so saying they hastened to depart, and spread the news. The youngest, indeed, was overheard to say, as she left the house, that she always thought there was something suspicious in the looks of that Livingston. Direful was the commotion at Van Corlear's; for despite of Gertrude's affected incredulity, there was too much reason to credit the unwelcome news. Seth's letter had stated the facts too definitely to admit of much question. The resemblance to the portrait; the full recognition of the claimant by the oldest of the slaves; and his consistent story in other respects, scarcely left room for a doubt. Besides this, the new heir manifested the utmost indifference as to whether his claim was promptly admitted or not, having, as he said, abundant evidence at command in the person of an old college acquaintance now in England, who had shared his captivity in Algiers. Old Burley broke three successive pipes in trying to fire up for reflection on this important subject, and finally dashing pipes and tobacco together into the fire, he gave way to a series of Dutch anathemas, which, properly strung, would have reached half way to Kenterhook. “The tuyfel,” he said, “might have come if he had chosen, and should have been heartily welcome; but for this sea-soaked mollyyhack to turn up now, after lying six years quietly under water, potstausends!” said the old man, “donner and blitzen!” and he stamped about the room until the whole house rang with the echoes of his elephantine feet. Dame Van Corlear also was not a little afflicted, for she too had indulged in her dreams of ambition, though these were of an extremely modified character. She had counted largely, indeed, on her daughter's elevation to the superintendence of the Kenterhook dairy, with its interminable rolls of freshly made butter, and its long triple tiers of nicely shelved and snowy little Dutch cheeses; and had indulged in some far-reaching visions of periodical visits to the manor house on occasions of unusual interest. But with the simplicity of a very guileless heart, she did not think of suspecting the stranger's claim. “Bleecker,” she said, “was her own cousin only six times removed, and was a very good boy, and his rights were his rights, and of course he wouldn't pretend to be alive if he wasn't, would he?', Gertrude had descended sufficiently from her first lofty position to peruse the dreadful letter, and she felt a secret, sickening, withering conviction that its contents were true. But she entertained no idea of tame submission. If Bleecker Van Ness had really returned, he was alone, friendless, and without pecuniary means to prosecute his claims; while Livingston, already in possession of the estate, would be able to keep up a protracted and expensive litigation, which would be ruinous to his competitor. She did not allow herself to doubt that the new claimant would shrink from so unequal a contest, and that, long accustomed to hardships and privations abroad, he would gladly resign his pretensions for a competence that would insure him a quiet and peaceful home. In a word, he was to be bought off. A few thousand pounds would but slightly impair Livingston's magnificent estate, and were not worth a thought. These were the flattering reflections in which Gertrude indulged, as still holding the abhorred letter, she sat, in the deepest abstraction, gazing upon the floor. But a sudden flush suffused her pale face, and her little foot fell with a hammer-like force upon the carpet. “Oh why,” she exclaimed, “why must those malicious old maids, those very trumpeters of Fame, have been here at such a moment! And why did that very idiot of a Jessie proclaim it before them? The neighborhood—the city—aye, the whole province,” she continued, rising and clasping her hands in agony, “will ring with the news!” But Gertrude's grief was altogether secret; before others she carefully concealed her apprehensions, and treated the whole affair with ridicule. Livingston at length came. He was met by Burley without, bearing as dolorous a face as one so round and rubicund could be, who returned his joyous salutations by hinting, in general terms, at intelligence of the most dismal and awful nature. Appalled and stunned at the thought of Gertrude's death or dangerous illness, the noble-hearted young man was really relieved on learning that his misfortune extended only to the probable loss of his property. Not that he was unmoved at the prospect of so serious a calamity; on the contrary his alarm was great. He hastened to meet Gertrude, anxious to dispel her fears, but was surprised to find that she manifested but little concern on the subject. He was induced, indeed, by her example, to hope that there was no serious ground for apprehension. His prompt and honorable resolve was to subject the claims of the stranger to the severest scrutiny, and, if fully convinced of his rights, to surrender the estate without litigation. But before learning this conclusion, Gertrude had hinted in no ambiguous terms, at her own ingenious scheme, provided indeed, which she very much doubted, that any action at all should be requisite. “Surely, Gertrude,” replied Livingston, “this is hardly a subject to jest upon.” “I do not jest,” returned Miss Van Corlear, “but I would not have you sacrifice everything to a mere abstract idea of right and wrong.” A sudden pallor overspread the face of Livingston. “And is it thus,” he said, “that you designate the immutable principle of Justice?” Gertrude had the grace to color at this reproof, and murmured something to the effect that she was scarcely conscious of what she said or thought on so exciting a subject. The patroon mused sadly and in silence for some minutes upon so startling a disclosure of principles, but came charitably to the conclusion that Gertrude's remarks had been only the result of a thoughtless and momentary impulse. He at once addressed a letter to Seth, inviting his guest to pay him a personal visit at Van Corlear's, that he might have the means of judging of the correctness of his claims. To this he received a ready answer from the claimant himself, assuring him that he would do himself the honor to wait upon Mr. Livingston in a very few days, until when, he begged that he might be considered the latter's very much obliged, and very humble, and very obedient servant. How this distinguished gentleman travelled from Kenterhook to New York does not with any certainty appear, but he arrived at Van Corlear's from the city in no small state. A sumptuous carriage and a span of pawing, champing horses, and a coachman black as Night, and a footman still blacker, were seen, suddenly standing before the alderman's gate, fully exposed to an extensive masked battery of eyes from the Van Dingle garrison opposite, including the cross guns of Miss Eve. The dress of the individual who alighted from this vehicle corresponded with his travelling equipage. The hands of no provincial artisan had been upon the elegant apparel that enveloped the graceful form of Mr. Bleecker Van Ness. If it had been allowable to criticise the labors of a London shop, a practised eye might possibly have found fault with the fitting of some of these trans-atlantic garments, but nothing could be more captivating than the rich ample cloak, as yet unknown in the colonies, which hung suspended from the shoulders, and fell in many a graceful fold around the faultless legs of the new patroon. Gertrude's heart sank within her, as she perceived all these evidences of resources in the stranger. She feared that he would hardly prove a purchasable commodity, or if so, that he was undoubtedly marked up exceedingly high, with no discount for the ready money. Now it so chanced that Livingston was absent in the city, at the time of this important visit, and it so happened, nay, it did not happen, for it was a pre-concerted plan of Gertrude's, that there was a pompous pragmatical Dutch lawyer, named Van Bummel, a cousin of the Van Corlears, tarrying with the family for a few days. He was not exactly retained in a professional manner, but Gertrude was anxious to avoid the dangerous effect of first impressions in favor of the new heir, and she had great confidence in her cousin's adroitness in making any given subject whatever wear just such an aspect as he chose. In company with that gentleman, therefore, and with him only, Gertrude contrived to receive the distinguished guest, who, having been assured that Mr. Livingston would soon be at home, had graciously consented to await his return. Miss Van Corlear's reception of her visiter was cool to the last degree; and Van Bummel, in addressing him as Mr. Van Ness, thought proper to do so under special protest that he did not thereby admit or deny the gentleman's right to the cognomen which he had assumed, but left the matter entirely open for future proof, or rebuttal, in the same manner as if he had never spoken, pronounced, uttered, ejaculated, or mentioned the same in any manner whatever. The stranger replied only by a contemptuous stare at the swoln-looking attorney, and helping himself to a seat near Gertrude, he assured her that it was with the greatest pain he had learned that his assumption of his legal rights at home was to be accompanied by severe disappointment on the part of some of his worthy relations. The lady replied, that from what little she had learned upon the subject, she believed there was no cause for his giving himself any very great uneasiness upon that point; and that although Mr. Harry Livingston and his friends would never be found backward in restoring to others their rights, she did not think that a princely estate was to be yielded up merely for the asking, even although the modest claimant should possess an accidental resemblance to the true heir. “I admire, madam,” replied the other, “the very ingenious and very correct view which you seem to have of this matter. I have said frequently to your brother Seth, Cousin Harry will recognize me at a glance; he will see the fidelity of the portrait in his own study, at which he has so often gazed, and he will never dream of disputing my rights. But it is, as you say, a princely estate to which I lay claim, and I would prefer making stronger proof of my title. I have the most ample evidence at command, and with cousin Harry's permission, shall despatch a special messenger at once to England—another to the Netherlands—and a third to—to—Algiers.” “It is very well,” interposed Van Bummel, “that you are in no particular haste if you propose to await 5 the return of your express from Algiers. He would do well to carry his ransom in his pocket.” “Ah, never fear,” returned Derick; “I assure you I left the city on very good terms with the Dey.” “And how, if I may inquire,” continued the pertinacious Van Bummel, “how was your own release effected?” “With that of seventeen others, by the intervention of the British government,” replied Derick promptly. “My friend, Lord Sidney, heard, by the merest accident, of my imprisonment, through an escaped sailor, who had once seen that noble lord and myself walking arm-in-arm in front of Somerset House, and who, fortunately for me, had a devilish good memory.” “Yes, sir,” continued the lawyer, “it was so; and it would perhaps be still more fortunate for you, if you had a good memory yourself. Do we not very well know that the English government is deeply engaged in intestine wars—that the whole realm is agitated with the struggles of the dethroned monarch to regain his lost crown—and that the royal William, but half secure of his throne, would be little apt to give heed to any such trivial matters?” “I must say,” returned Derick, “that you are exceedingly, nay, I may say, surpassingly impertinent, and that at a proper time I will hold you responsible therefor. Yet for the satisfaction of this lady, I will make answer, that it was during a temporary lull of the war that my friend found access to the ear of King William—despatched a man-of-war to the Barbary coast—bombarded the city of Algiers—destroyed seventy-three houses and three mosques, and brought the Dey to terms in twenty-four hours.” “Nay, then,” replied Van Bummel, with a scintillation of Dutch wit, “if the Dey held out for twenty-four hours, that was certainly as much as could be expected.” Although this joke produced a laugh, it did not seem in the least to soften the asperity of Van Bummel himself, who, lowering his spectacles, and eyeing Derick still more closely, continued: “And so the Moorish monarch not only released you, but took you to his palace, I warrant, filled your pockets with gold, and gave you an order on his lord high tailor for a suit of Christian clothes?” “Under protest again, against your very amusing impudence, not so,” replied Derick. “You are surprised to see me well dressed, and apparently in no want of money. The secret is plain; I have been in the hands of the Jews.” “The Jews? They are said to leave scarcely the skin, much less a covering of superfine saxony on their customers.” “You misunderstand me: it is a common thing abroad to raise money of the usurers on estates in expectancy. I have supplied my wants from this source; and, by the way,” he continued, finding that Van Bummel pressed him pretty hard, “I find that I have a few thousand pounds more than I require, which I should like to put into safe hands for investment— possibly into yours.” The latter part of this speech was addressed in a low tone to the attorney, and produced a singular change in his deportment. His hitherto rattling fire occurred now at long intervals, and finally sunk to a mere pop-gun affair. He soon, indeed, called Gertrude aside, and to her great consternation informed her that he thought, on the whole, there could be no rational doubt that the individual before them was Mr. Bleecker Van Ness, the rightful proprietor of all the estates of Kenterhook. The interview having been considerably protracted without the return of Livingston, the guest took his leave, and promised to call again on the ensuing day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Gertrude had seen the new heir. She had observed, despite her unwillingness, his resemblance to the late patroon; she had seen him undergo what she thought a rigid cross-examination from her own legal adviser, and even that had proved unfavorable to her interests. Was there then no hope? Should “the fates” triumph over her? Should she be the laughing-stock of the whole world? No—she would not submit. Harry should defend his rights to the very last! To the high court of Parliament, if necessary, should the question go, to be settled in some future generation, among future heirs. Such was the determination of Gertrude, to which, with an iron will, she resolved that Harry should consent. Even although the stranger was the true heir, she argued to herself, his claim was too old to be thus trumped up when the rights of so many others had become involved. “Possession is nine parts of the law; what can't be proved, doesn't exist,” she said, with several other equally moral axioms, which she had caught up from her astute counsel before his sudden conversion. When Livingston returned from the city, it was in company with old Aunt Schermerhorn, who had once seen Bleecker Van Ness, and who thought she could settle the question of identity; for Harry's mind was so harassed with the excitement that he was anxious in some way to terminate his suspense. He had a painful presentiment that his own very first glance of the stranger's face would be convincing as to the correctness of his pretensions; but he felt that he ought not to be satisfied with that proof alone. Gertrude hastened to relate to him the interview of the morning, to which, of course, she gave her own coloring, while the old lawyer maintained a discreet silence, not being quite certain yet which way the wind would set. Derick was faithful to his appointment on the ensuing day, and was received this time in committee of the whole. A thrill of amazement, distinct and perceptible, seemed to pass through the whole company, on their simultaneous perception of a countenance which, whoever or whatever it belonged to was so strikingly like that of the good old patroon. Dame Van Corlear was just restrained by an imperative frown from Gertrude, from rising and grasping the visiter by the hand; while, in the strong resemblance to the portrait of Bleecker, Livingston had an additional ground of apprehension, and his few remaining hopes were fast flitting away. The salutations on both sides were courteous, though cool, and conversation at once took a business turn. Aunt Schermerhorn was the only one of the company who had ever seen Bleecker since he was a very small boy, and some favorable turn was hoped for from her verdict. The stranger made no hesitation in submitting to a close scrutiny from the old dame, who, having wiped her spectacles with great care, walked deliberately up to him, and peered silently for some minutes into his face. Gertrude's heart beat violently, and even poor Harry felt his breath come quicker during this examination. There was perfect silence in the room, and the excitement, of which even the old lady seemed to partake, grew momentarily stronger. Again and again did she gaze at each individual feature, and when, at length, she lowered her spectacles to speak, more than one heart stood suddenly still with emotion. “I think it is Bleecker!” said the old lady, and Gertrude lay swooning upon the floor. Borne from the room, and speedily resuscitated, it was only, in the violence of her emotion, to heap reproaches upon Livingston, who with affectionate solicitude sought to dispel her grief. “Why,” she said, “should you search out witnesses against yourself, and aid your adversary to make good his claims? Never mortal before heard of such fatuity! If you are so soon tired of your wealth, Mr. Livingston, remember that there are others who have a right now to be consulted in its disposal.” Bewildered by anger and mortification, such was the language of Gertrude. Livingston listened for a few moments with the keenest anguish to the revelations thus opened to him, of a heart which he had long so devotedly loved. But he listened in silence. He returned to the parlor with a settled conviction that fate had no remaining dart in all its armory for him, more keen than those which he had already felt. If 5* such were the wealth of human love; if all the treasures of affection amounted to but this, then not for a few square miles of soil would he condescend to grieve. Two cubic yards would better subserve the purpose of any rational man, for that would serve to hide him from a world deserving only of execration and contempt. Such were the first bitter thoughts that forced themselves in a dark current over the mind of the ingenuous youth, flooding and overwhelming for a while every nobler sentiment. But a better spirit soon returned. The very violence of his feelings caused a sudden reaction, and Hope and Charity came hastening back to the posts from which they had been temporarily frightened. He would be better satisfied yet before he recognized the stranger's claims and yielded up dear Gertrude's rights. Having made this resolve, he reentered the room where Derick was entertaining the company with the accounts of his toils under cruel taskmasters, upon the piers and fortifications of the barbarian's capital. The subject of identity being resumed, Aunt Schermerhorn suggested that there was one relation of the family who she thought could settle the matter beyond dispute, by reason of his know intimacy with the late patroon, and that was a cousin, of the same name, who lived far off to the north, away beyond Schagticoke, but whose Christian name she had forgotten. “Ah, I remember him,” interposed Derick; “old cousin Bartholomew! a lame old cock!” “That's the name,” replied Aunt Schermerhorn, “Bartholomew; and he is very lame.” Harry turned a thought paler at this additional proof in the stranger's favor. He whispered a moment with the old lady, and then proceeded to ask one more question, trembling while he awaited a reply. “If you do, indeed, remember him so well,” he said, “there is still another peculiarity of his person which you can hardly have forgotten.” Derick drew his finger diagonally across his upper lip and smiled; it was in allusion to a hare-lip of the old man, and seemed conclusive beyond further cavil. “I can no longer doubt,” said Harry, extending his hand to his cousin, “that you are what you claim to be. As the son of my deceased friend and benefactor, I welcome you,”—his voice faltered as he spoke—“I heartily welcome you back to your native land. For the sake of those whose interests are bound up in my own, and who have a right to be more incredulous than myself, I will not offer to resign to you your rights, until your witness arrives from England. Until then, however, share with me in everything of what thereafter will be exclusively your own.” “Not exclusively, cousin Harry,” returned Derick, pompously; “I intend that the Wilton farm shall be yours.” Harry looked surprised at this narrow generosity for the land alluded to, although a tract of about a thousand acres, was scarcely worth half that number of pounds. He made, however, no reply. His cousin expressed himself perfectly willing to await returns from England, and his entire readiness to acquiesce in this proposal dispelled the last shade of doubt that had rested on his claims. There would be nearly a year's delay preceding his full investiture in his rights, but he was looked upon as virtually the present owner of the deceased patroon's estates. But Derick had still a further ordeal to undergo, for although he was now no longer questioned by way of testing his claims, a natural desire pervaded the minds of his companions to learn all the particulars of those remarkable vicissitudes of fortune to which he had been subjected. So reasonable a curiosity could not be censured, and vainly did he seek to evade the torrent of questions which was poured in upon him from all quarters, but chiefly, of course, from the sympathizing old ladies. “Tell us about your capture,” exclaimed Aunt Schermerhorn, “all about it, and the fighting, and the black flag and all; and where it was, and how many were killed, and strangled, and bow-stringed, and goodness gracious me! do tell us all about it now!” she said, drawing her chair closer to Derick, and folding up her spectacles, as she gazed with watery eyes into his face. Derick, thus adjured, buried his face for a moment in his handkerchief, doubtless to conceal the emotion which it would have been unmanly to betray, as the remembrance of some dreadful scenes returned to his mind. “Well, you see,” he said, speaking with the hesitation which strong emotion always occasions, “we were somewhere in latitude about forty-four, and longitude—let me see—say twenty-two west from Greenwich—when we were overtaken by a tremendous gale, most tre-men-dous; and were compelled to scud under bare poles.” “Bare polls indeed,” muttered Van Bummel, in a voice inaudible to Derick; “it blew your hats off, I suppose.” “Seventy-four hours and a half—and a half—” “Going,” whispered the lawyer— “— did that wind continue, whistling, howling, screaming among the cordage of the vessel, like some wild animal, impatient for his prey.” This poetical flight arrested the attention of Van Bummel, who being himself a wholesale dealer in flowers of rhetoric, began to think he might pick up something for future use, and closed his jaws for once as firmly as those of a steel-trap. “So dreadful and so long-continued was the blast,” continued Derick, “that it seemed impossible we should finally escape its fury, and our ship lay at one time for six hours together on her beam-ends.” “Awful!” exclaimed Aunt Schermerhorn, “right straight up on end! well—go on.” “We were of course blown off our track many hundred miles, and when the gale abated we found ourselves off the north-western coast of Africa.” “Maircy!” said the old lady, hitching her chair still nearer to Derick, but without removing her eyes from his face. “Yes, ma'am,” continued the latter, “and not more than fifty miles from the Mediterranean. The captain then put the ship about, and made all sail for America, but we had not gone more than three knots before we discovered a fast-sailing sloop-of-war on the weather-bow, coming down upon us like the wind. It was an English-built ship, and under English colors, and no one thought of being alarmed until she was close alongside, when down came the banner of St. George, and up went the black flag; while at the same instant two hundred blackamoors who had been concealed on deck sprang to their feet, with a tremendous shout, and sixteen long cannon were suddenly unmasked, pointing their great black open mouths straight at us—and the captain, a hideous looking Moor, stood waving his sword on the quarter-deck, and calling on us to surrender. There was no use in fighting; they would have blown us out of water and air too in ten seconds at the very most, and so our captain struck his flag. Then you see, ma'am, they boarded us at once, and instantly put to death—” “Oh, maircy! maircy!” “—all our pigs and poultry; for they had been at sea a long time, and were quite out of fresh provisions. They would doubtless have served us in the same way, if we had not been worth more to them alive. They took us straight to Algiers, and reported us to the government, as so many head of infidels, fit for labor, and so many invalids—two or three, you know, poor sickly fellows, whom they just—” Derick here waved his curved finger toward the back of his neck by way of conclusion. “What? what?” asked Aunt Schermerhorn, with distended eyes. “The scimetar, you know,” he continued—“one blow, and the head was overboard, with the lips still moving that had begged for mercy!” The old ladies here gave a united scream, under cover of which Derick attempted to retreat, with the promise of resuming his narrative at some future time; but this design was frustrated by his eager listeners. “Wan't you terribly scairt, Bleecker?” asked Dame Van Corlear. “Well, I must say those health-officers frightened me a little—for I was rather puny then, and they seemed to hesitate on my case, one feeling of me, and the other standing by with his scimetar. It was neck or nothing then, ma'am. But they pushed me aside and passed on, and the next day I found myself wheeling a barrow of dirt up a steep hill, a Sisyphan sort of amusement, which I was allowed to pursue steadily for the next eighteen months, after which I was promoted to laying stone. I shouldn't have cared so much for the work, for I grew as fat as a seal on it, but it was rather aggravating to be ordered about by a black Moor, with a turban on his head, sixteen inches of beard, and a whip in his hand.” “And you a patroon's son, too,” said Aunt Schermerhorn. “And I a patroon's son, too,” said Derick. There were some points in this story which aroused the pettifogging spirit of Van Bummel not a little and he began to square himself for a few puzzling cross-questions, his very spectacles assuming for a moment an air of triumph, when he fortunately remembered that his interest was on the other side, which, on the whole, he concluded must be the right side, saying nothing at all about the investments. Gertrude had not been present during the latter part of the consultation, but she was soon informed of its result. A stormy train of passions continued to agitate her mind, but amidst them all was nought of commiseration for Harry; no thought of self-censure, humility, or submission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Alone, in her own room, pondering deeply upon the past, remembering with a gleam of ecstasy the sunny hopes which had once flashed across her mind, and then forever disappeared, sat Jessie. Long endured and long concealed sorrow had slightly impaired the crimson tinge of her cheek, and changed a little, a very little, that elastic step, from which, in other days, the bending flowers had risen unharmed. Notwithstanding her sister had been so studiously cold and cruel toward her, she would still have felt a deep commiseration for her under any real calamity; but she had no sympathy for a distress which proceeded solely from disappointed ambition, and she could not but feel that so lofty a pride deserved so great a fall. What was there, indeed, in Gertrude's fate, that demanded pity? She looked into her own heart, and felt that under similar circumstances the loss of wealth would have wrung no sigh from her; nay, that she would almost have rejoiced at the opportunity which adversity ever gives of winning a closer shelter under the wings of affection. And such was the light, she did not doubt, in which her sister would soon regard the change, laughing at the remembrance of present grief. Poor simple Jessie! such was thy faith still in Gertrude, the proud, the cold, the scornful Gertrude, whose heart, to thine, was as the barren sand-bank to the flowery parterre. It was not until some hours after the departure of Derick, that Livingston sought the presence of Miss Van Corlear. He came to bestow condolence where he had a right to seek it—to ask forgiveness where he might require apology. Unmoved by calamity, overflowing with kindness, he came to meet still a haughty frown and imperious demands. Then, even then, Gertrude found it in her heart to ask, nay to insist upon what she had resolved should be. “Let the Law,” she said, “determine this great question; when the courts, aye, the last court of appeal shall have adjudicated it, then it will be time enough to surrender your rights.” In vain did Livingston assure her that nothing short of the most conclusive proof should satisfy him. “It is not enough,” she said; “you must employ skilful counsel, who are accustomed to unweave, aye, and to weave tangled webs, and who will soon, I warrant you, raise such a pother about this interloper's ears that he will be glad to retreat with whatever you choose to give him.” “And do you really mean, Gertrude,” asked Livingston, solemnly, “that I should do all this, even if I am myself convinced that his claim is just?” “You have no right to be convinced,” she replied quickly; “it is a question for the courts to settle. Ask legal proof, that will bear sifting and re-sifting; use all the complicated machinery of the Law; throw the case into Chancery, only to come out in another century, and by such means you will at least secure the estate for your own life-time, which is all that is really important. Do not seek to be so much better than your neighbors; others have done it, why not you?” “I could indeed,” said Harry, “do all that you require. The Law is a friend to the rich. Drive but to its temples in a coach-and-six, and you may drive over the broken hearts and crushed hopes of the hapless crowds who throng, penniless, around its gates. But when I consent to do this—mark me now, Gertrude Van Corlear! when I consent to use the tortures, the racks, and the thumb-screws of the Law, to defraud the son of my old, aye, my only friend, then may his loved form rise from its grave, and haunt me till I sink into my own!” It was not with the declamation of the schools, but with the richer eloquence of nature, attested by quivering lips and gushing tears, that this was said. But Gertrude was not moved. “If it is in the light of a threat,” she rejoined, “that you speak of your deceased uncle as your only friend, let me assure you, Mr. Livingston—” “Nay, Gertrude, forbear! I anticipate your meaning. Let it not all come to this, or at least not now. Take a little time to reflect, and we may yet be happy in the realization of brighter days even than those that we have so long anticipated. In calmer moments—” “I am calm now, Mr. Livingston; calm enough to say that your visions of a quiet cottage and clustering honeysuckles are unsuited to my taste.” “A better spirit, Gertrude, will be yours—you will repent—” “No, Mr. Livingston; he who refuses me the first boon that I ever asked of him, will probably refuse the last.” “And are you then, really, in earnest? Do you ask no time to reflect? a week? a day? an hour, even?” “Not a minute, sir!” And thus they parted. That same evening beheld Livingston on his way homeward. Not without kind words and earnest entreaties from Gertrude's parents to prolong his stay; but without another word sought or given from her. His leave-taking was a hasty one, and none knew of the quarrel but as it might be guessed by his pale cheek and excited bearing. Dame Van Corlear, never too astute, suspected nothing amiss. That the nuptials should be again postponed, was, under the circumstances, not a matter of surprise, and perhaps scarcely of regret. Pressing business of some kind, growing out of the new state of things, doubtless demanded Harry's abrupt departure. She never dreamed, good soul, and never would have consented, as far as her influence went, to any estrangement between him and Gertrude. As to the alderman, so many remarkable events had put him in great perplexity, and in vain did he seek to clarify his ideas with his never-dying pipe. A little smoking volcano, grumbling mightily within, and threatening continual eruptions, was Burley. Like the thin vapors that rose around him, like the ignis fatuus of the marsh, like the mirage of the desert, all his anticipated honors were vanishing from his view. Not that this imagery of thought passed through Burley's mind. He dealt but little in similes, and in those of a different class. Mixed metaphors were Burley's, for in his mind everything was mixed. It possessed, indeed, an agglomerating power peculiar to itself, and over its recondite treasures hung a perpetual haze, undisturbed by one clear and lucid idea. Had such a visiter found entrance there, it would have been like a stray sunbeam amid the cobwebs of a dungeon. Some men's first impressions are correct, and some attain certainty by reflection; but to neither of these classes belonged Burley. Before, therefore, he could decide whether Harry's departure boded evil or good, the latter was gone, and, gliding quietly over the waters of the Hudson, was reflecting painfully on the singular turn of fortune, which in one short week had divested him of home, of property, and of friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 CHAPTER X. It had been a hard day's chase, had Seth's, but not, as the bleeding trophies of his skill attested, not a fruitless one. A noble stag formed the nucleus of a pile of smaller game which lay in the court, and around which, like so many crows, chattering and gabbling, the delighted negroes, young and old, were clustered. While one examined the larger victim, to see at what point the fatal ball had entered, others handled the hapless wild fowl or the glossy squirrel, and the merry Josh was fingering exultingly the carcass of a silver fox to see if its unbroken skin would afford material for a winter's cap. “'Tis de berry feller,” he said, putting his finger upon him, and looking gravely up, while his huge lower lip seemed to swell with emotion, “de berry feller dat stole my chickens, kase I see him one mornin' arly, jes peep o' day, draggin' off a squalkin' old hen. Darefore,” raising the body of Reynard, and looking to the patriarchal Jake for approval, “darefore his hide is mine.” Taking a paralytic and involuntary nod of uncle Jake's head for assent, he ran off with his prize, making the yard ring with his laughter, and followed by a troop of noisy children. Seth, fatigued with his day's labors, sat resting within. His mind had reverted, as it did twenty times a day, to the state of affairs at home, and he was becoming anxious to know the result of an experiment which he had but recently remembered he never had the right to make. He had acted from an impulse created by generous feelings; yet he had acted wrong. Fearful of some indefinite harm, he was pondering deeply on the subject, when an additional shout and commotion was heard without, so loud that he was almost prepared to see his slaughtered stag returned to life, and scampering back to the forests. Nothing else occurred to him at the moment that could have caused such a turmoil. He started toward the door, where he was met by the whole gang, each eager to be first in announcing that a sloop was coming up the river, and putting in toward the adjacent landing. Seth ran out, and perceiving the intelligence to be true, hastened to the wharf attended by his sable train. That the vessel was the bearer either of Livingston or Derick he did not for a moment doubt, but the uncertainty as to everything else threw him into a state of nervous excitement most painful to endure. That his brilliant scheme had all fallen to the ground by some blunder or inefficiency of his coadjutor, and that Derick had returned discovered and disgraced, was his first fearful suspicion. His next, that Livingston and Gertrude were themselves on board the vessel, and the white wing of a passing gull was, for a moment, transformed by his excited fears into the flaunting feathers of his sister's bridal bonnet. Great therefore was his delight to find that Harry had returned alone. The greeting between the young men was cordial in the extreme, and there was but little in Livingston's countenance or deportment to mark the extent of his recent sufferings. His views and feelings indeed had already undergone a material change. His grief was turned into the most bitter indignation. Gertrude's faithlessness, her desertion of him at the very onset of adversity—her total absence of sympathy for his sufferings, and above all, her hardihood in requiring of him an act of positive injustice as the price of her continued regard, began all to appear in its true light. Baleful indeed was that light. It was as if an angel radiant with beauty, had suddenly assumed the features and the scowl of a fiend. Livingston no longer loved. The glowing flame of his affection was extinguished at once and forever. He grieved indeed, not for the loss of Gertrude, but because the Gertrude of his imagination had never existed. He felt that he had been standing, with closed eyes, on the brink of a precipice, and that some friendly hand had drawn him forcibly back from the danger. Safely as Seth had calculated on Gertrude's character, he was not prepared to hear that it had been so soon developed. He had no expectation of news as good as that. And when he heard it; when he heard that the engagement was finally and effectually broken off, beyond all possible reconciliation, he was for a while as fit a candidate for a lunatic asylum, as ever entered the walls of Bloomingdale. Hastening to get away from Harry's presence, that he might give way to his merriment, he flew to the barn—an old barn it was, habited by a thousand echoes which joined in the roystering laugh, and the hearty three times three of his loud huzzas. He danced, he shouted, he flung his cap to the roof for the fiftieth time, which the roof, joining in the sport, finally caught with splintery fingers, and refused to return, twinkling gleefully down upon him with a pair of knot-hole eyes. And when he had exhausted his own strength, he summoned Josh, famed for his obstreperous mirth, and exhibiting a piece of money, bade the negro laugh for him to about that value, and to mind and do his best. Josh roared at the very idea of the thing, for his cachinnatory apparatus was set with a hair trigger, and went off easily. His detonations were perfectly astounding, while his employer, panting and grinning, sat cheering him on. When this little business matter was over, Seth returned quietly to the house, with a face not materially redder than a peony. Livingston bore his changed fortunes with reasonable fortitude. But he was no stoic. He looked abroad upon the immense estate of which he was but yesterday the proprietor, commanding a personal influence unsurpassed in private life in the whole province, and he remembered that he was now a beggar, dependent on his own exertions, or on the stinted generosity of his cousin, for the very means of existence. He had already seen in Gertrude's conduct a specimen of the changed treatment which he might expect from the world under his calamity. Reflection therefore served to magnify his grief and his fears. By degrees he confided to Seth all the particulars of his quarrel with Gertrude, and was astonished to find that his friend manifested no kind of surprise at the recital. It was no small budget of charges and specifications that the young Van Corlear, acting on this hint, opened against his haughty sister, and Harry was really relieved to learn that her recent conduct, characteristic of herself, was not necessarily a type of all human nature. Misanthropy had begun to overshadow with her ebon wings his tortured mind, but the cheering voice of his companion recalled him to hope. A ready listener, too, did Seth now find whenever he felt disposed to chant the praises of Jessie, for Harry had himself begun to remember her many excellencies, her exceeding beauty and gentleness, her frankness, modesty and truth. He remembered, too, how often he had thought, yet banished the idea as treason to Gertrude, that an earlier acquaintance with Jessie might possibly have made her the object of his choice. “Would she,” he said suddenly to himself, “have deserted me thus? Would she have been the very first to forsake me, setting an example for the hollow-hearted world to follow?” His whole heart, sending its warm life-tide forth with renewed force, answered, “No!” It was a bright November morning, and Livingston was sitting in his study arranging the few papers which would be needed in rendering an account of his brief stewardship, when Seth, suddenly entering the room, invited his friend to accompany him to the observatory, a modern addition to the house, which, although looking very much out of place, and very ill at ease, commanded an extensive and magnificent view. The broad and noble Hudson, forest-lined, lay spread out before them, with calm unbroken surface, and in the distance, the lofty Kaatskill mountains were seen mingling their summits with the sky. But not on these objects, long familiar to their view, did the attention of the young men rest. “Do you see,” said Seth, pointing to a house “set upon a hill,” nearly ten miles southward, “do you see that distant building?” “Yes,” replied Harry; “there lives one of the tenants of Bleecker Van Ness.” “And do you see,” rejoined Seth, “this other dwelling with windows glistening in the sun?” pointing to one about the same distance northward. “Yes,” was the reply; “there lives another of the tenants of Bleecker Van Ness.” “And do you see yonder lofty oak?” continued the querist, pointing to a conspicuous tree, leafless and bare, several miles eastward. “I do,” replied Harry; “it is on the eastern line of Bleecker's estate.” “And all the intermediate land—?” “Is Bleecker's—why do you torture me with these questions?” “Harry Livingston!” exclaimed Seth, grasping his companion's hand, and looking earnestly in his face, “Harry Livingston! there is no Bleecker Van Ness! You are the owner of these broad lands! You are the patroon of Kenterhook! Hate me, punish me as you 6* choose; I am the author of the delusion which has so long held you spell-bound.” There was truth in every line of Seth's honest face, —truth in every sparkle of his eye; Harry could not doubt it. Alternately flushed and pale with emotion, aye, with deep unutterable joy, he spoke with difficulty in reply: “Who then is the pretended heir?” “His name is indeed Van Ness, and he is a son of that cousin Bartholomew, who—” “Enough! I see it all now; and what, Seth, has been the object of this strange drama?” “What has been its effect?” retorted Seth triumphantly. “True, true,” exclaimed Harry, emphatically; “you have given me a brief, bitter experience, but you have saved me from a life-long sorrow.” It was with a proud step that Livingston once more walked abroad upon his ancestral soil; his foot fell firmly on the ground, and he gazed with delight on the beautiful landscape around him. “It is mine!” he said, musing deeply, and feeling that strong sense of gratitude to Providence, without which all happiness wants its highest relish; for his was no selfish joy, no petty pride of purse, no contemptible love of property for its own sake. But Seth was far from feeling an equal delight. His object was but half accomplished, and over the remaining part he felt that he had no control. Livingston grew taciturn and thoughtful, as the few succeeding weeks rolled by, but did not seem unhappy. Of a confiding and generous nature, his disappointment had been at first painful to endure, but reflection had summoned both Pride and Anger to his relief, auxiliaries which had waged war with Grief, and left upon the battle-ground of his heart no vestiges of affection. Whatever might thenceforth be his destiny, Gertrude must forever remain to him a stranger, and that bright page of Memory, which had been filled with thoughts of her, was to be a perpetual blank. It was about ten days prior to Christmas that a changed deportment in the young patroon gave token of some new and sudden resolution. There might be doubts about it, his eye and manner seemed to say, but it should be done. His countenance assumed that calmness and serenity which follows the decision of mental conflict, his voice became cheerful, and after the lapse of a few days he threw Seth into another paroxysm of ecstacies, by proposing that they should return at once to New York, to spend the holidays. “I consider my old invitation,” he said, “sufficient warrant for the visit, and you will, of course, be welcome.” “Never fear for the welcome,” replied Seth; “hip— hip—hurrah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “And how dush it all stand now?” asked Burley, pipe in hand, one December morning, after vainly trying to unite the fragments of several ideas, that were floating dreamily through his head: “how dush it all stand? who ish de patroon, and who ishn't? Has de Dey of Algiers come yet? Where ish Harry, and where ish Bleecker, and where ish Getty, mit all mine guilters?” This was considerably the longest speech that the alderman had made since moving the honorable board that Mynheer Focke Jans should have his weekly half-barrel of beer free of excise—at which said Jans's house, the said honorable board were accustomed to meet—thereby foreshadowing the future privileges to which the fathers of the city should attain. A categorical reply seemed to be demanded to these questions, and it was given by Vrow Van Corlear in a breath, to the purport that Bleecker Van Ness was the patroon, and Harry Livingston wasn't, and the Dey of Algiers had not come yet, and was not expected, owing to pressing engagements at home, and that Gertrude had gone on a visit to Aunt Schermerhorn's, but the guilders she knew nothing at all about, and it was precious few of them that she ever saw, or ever expected to see. These answers put Burley into a brown study, from which he did not emerge for the remainder of the day. The last few weeks had been to Jessie a period of unusual gloom. Added to her private griefs, her shame and indignation at Gertrude's conduct, and her sympathy for Livingston under his two-fold calamity, made up a total of trouble which told rapidly upon the bloom of her beautiful cheek. It had been rumored that Harry had entered the provincial army, and was going to the northern frontiers, to take part in the war then pending with the French. Gertrude had heard the story from Derick with secret pleasure, and had repeated it to Jessie, adding, that she really hoped he would get promoted, for he was certainly a very good sort of body, but for some old-fashioned notions. “And by the way, Jessie,” she continued, “why don't you persuade your Harmon to enlist, for a campaign or two? He might distinguish himself by killing an Indian—or a papoose, perhaps,—and then you could have it on your coat-of-arms!” But the scalpel of Gertrude's wit had become powerless, and her sister listened to her only with silent contempt. She had now, as has been stated, gone on a visit, self-invited, to dear old Aunt Schermerhorn, for whom she had conceived a very sudden affection. It is true that Derick's hotel—for Derick was still living at a dashing style in the city—was somewhere in the same neighborhood, and that he was compelled to call occasionally on the old lady in gratitude for her ready recognition of him. But that, of course, had nothing to do with Gertrude's visit, and it was really very slanderous in old Van Bummel to say that her affections were like certain covenants known to the law, because they “run with the land.” Aunt Schermerhorn was not a little flattered by the civilities of the young patroon, and she took every opportunity to spread the news of his return, and to comment, with no light exaggerations, upon his adventures. The town became quite agog with the tidings, and if Derick had not prudently kept somewhat aloof from society, he would doubtless have been lionized beyond all precedent. As it was, his Scyllas and Charybdes lay thickly strewn around him, and it required the very skillfulest navigation to evade the dangerous contact. “Do you remember, Bleecker,” said the old lady, during a morning call from her dashing relative, “do you remember your old uncle Stoffle of Flushing— that is to say, he was your mother's uncle, and was very old and infirm?” “Oh, yes—yes—certainly—of course,” replied Derick, a little startled, for he knew the Cham of Tartary quite as well; “ah, yes, poor fellow; I used to pity him very much.” “Your father sent you there on a visit, just before you went abroad, you remember?” “Y—e—s,” said Derick, who felt that he was certainly abroad now, if he had never been before. “How long was it, Bleecker, that you staid there?” “Well, I don't remember, Aunty, I declare; I must have been there—oh, a number of days I should think.” “Days!” exclaimed the old lady; “why, your aunt told me the other day when I was down there, that you were with them four months, and went to school there, and said she so longed to see you.” “Ah, yes, the dear old soul—bless me—I'd forgotten; this foreign travel and captivity does put things so out of one's head; but how is the dear creature?” “Poorly, poorly, Bleecker; ah, she never held up her head after that dreadful affair, you know; it happened when you were there, I believe?” “Ah, certainly, yes, of course,” said Derick, floundering more and more. “She can't bear to speak of it, you know, and you must not say a word in her presence that points that way, for she is coming here soon to make a visit, and you'll come to see her, of course.” “Oh, I won't speak of it, of course not,” said Derick; “I wouldn't wound her feelings for the world.” “She is coming to stay several weeks with her pretty daughter Anna, whom you used to romp with so; but, Bleecker,” continued the querist, as the latter, by way of diverting the dangerous attack, was about to throw in a few Moors, with piled turbans and flashing scimetars; “Bleecker—how was it about that affair? I never could get at the whole story, and you were there, you know: do tell me now. The old man—?” “Yes,” said Derick, with amazing impudence, and trusting to the promptings of his inquisitor; “the old man—he—” “He did take a drop too much at times, poor fellow, didn't he?” “Oh, yes, yes, I think he did, beyond doubt, but I don't like to mention it—and then—” “Yes!” said the old lady. “You see—” “Yes!” was again the eager response. “By the way, how did you understand it at the time?” asked Derick, taking a pinch of snuff. “Oh, they did say, you know, that he was quite boozy, and set fire to the bed curtains, trying to get another dram in the night, and before they could get to him he was a mere crisp.” “Done brown—yes, that's about it, I suppose; wasn't it dreadful; why, when I was in Algiers—” “And now his poor wife—” “The great mosque took fire—” “And his daughter Anna—” “During prayer-time—” “And those three little children—” “And blew up!” continued Derick, raising his voice, in desperation, “scattering heads, trunks and limbs in every direction—never could be matched again!” “Maircy, Bleecker! how did that happen?” “Why, you see there was a kind of smuggling huckster, who had a shop in the basement, under pretence of selling fruit and fish to the faithful—a very devout Mussulman he was, and liked to be under the floor of the mosque, he said, because it was so holy—a mere cover, you know; he had nineteen barrels of powder under there, besides lots of kegs— he called 'em fish—the regular torpedos they proved to be, ha! ha! ha!”—and so Derick rattled on until the descent of Miss Van Corlear relieved him from the dangerous garrulity of his companion. The fates, meanwhile, were up in arms. They had been seen several times in wrathful conclave, and important results were anticipated from their councils. Distrusting their own fascinations, they had resolved—the two senior sisters carrying it by one against the yellow curls—to import a pretty cousin from Long Island to enter the lists against Gertrude. She was not only young and handsome, but she had metallic attractions to no inconsiderable amount, her well-cured old papa having ceased to smoke and been buried with his pipe, (peace to their ashes!) just one year before. She had been left an orphan, and the disconsolate proprietress of twelve long stockings-full of gold, a perfect little sub-treasury, for the management of which there had already been numerous candidates without distinction of party. Fortified with this addition to their strength, the fates plucked up courage, and made several small parties to which Derick was always invited, and Gertrude was always, by some oversight, left out. They had resolved, however, on giving a larger and more general party on Christmas Eve, and as there would be no pretence then for omitting the Van Corlears, the danger would have to be openly met. They were not afraid, however, at least they said they were not, with Miss Katrina Van Derspeigle on their side. But other events now claim attention. On a dark evening about ten days prior to Christmas, although not at all the season for fireworks, the alderman's house was once more suddenly irradiated by the blazing face of Seth. He did not come unexpected either, for Christmas would have brought him home from the antipodes, even if he had been obliged to return the next day. In roaring spirits too was Seth, and Jessie was as delighted as her little heart, laboring under its Atlas load, could be; and old Burley sputtered forth a very coherent welcome, and the good dame first kissed her son, and then, mindful of his supper, flew to order off the head of a hapless little rooster, which had retired to his perch without any surmise at all of so unpleasant an interruption to his slumbers. Thus was an opportunity afforded to Jessie to make inquiries, which she did not hesitate to do, about poor Harry. Had he really gone to the wars? and was there much danger? and how long would he be gone? and had Seth heard, had he heard of Gertrude's most shameful conduct? These and a dozen other questions had Jessie rattled off, every one of which Harry, standing in the passage, had heard, while Seth, grinning and chuckling, stood speechless before her. But Harry has entered the room, and has grasped her hand with a cousinly grasp, and kissed her with a cousinly kiss; but there was a flush on his cheek and a light in his eye, and the trace of a vanished tear that never a cousin need to have called up, and so Jessie put it all down to the credit of his lost and faithless Gertrude. Days passed on, and Jessie was delighted to see that Livingston retained a cheerful disposition under his heavy misfortunes. But other days came, and more delighted and more astonished still was Jessie, and signs and tokens grew more and stronger, until her little heart fluttered like a frightened bird in its cage, scared by obtrusive hand within the bars. But she would not see, and would not believe, for across her troubled mind came visions still of Gertrude returning penitent and in tears, to find in Harry a magnanimous and forgiving lover. The arrival of Harry and Seth, it will be remembered, had taken place in the evening, and had been unperceived even by the watchful Van Dingles. Seth, for a reason of his own, was desirous to keep it secret, and had no great difficulty in so doing. Gertrude troubled herself very little about affairs at home, whither she did not intend to return until after Christmas; but she would be present at the Van Dingle party on the evening preceding that festival, and was expected to look in at home before returning to the city. The twenty-fourth of December was just such a day as every whole-souled man would desire to have it. It was very cold, and the snow came down in one continuous day-long descent. There was no earth, no sky, no houses or trees to be seen; for the air was literally filled with the little flakes, which jostled and crowded each other in their haste to get down in time for Christmas. Three inches to the hour, by old Burley's weather-gage—a huge tin pan— did the snow accumulate all that day, and seemed just as fresh and brisk at nightfall in its descent as ever. But scarcely had the first feathery tier touched the ground before Seth's bay colts, and Seth's sleigh and buffalo robes and whip, and Seth himself, were paraded at the door. “I'll do it!” he said, muttering to himself as he hitched the horses and hurried into the house, where he had a brief and laughing consultation with Harry. Then he bounded back to the sleigh, and if that and the colts had been the apparition which their whitened surface seemed, they could scarcely have vanished quicker than they did, to the cracking of the flourished whip, while the sound of their merry bells came back to the ear long after they had ceased to be visible. When Seth returned, which he did a few hours subsequently at the same dashing speed, he had a companion; a glum, gruff man, from whom the frightened children fled, for they had gathered around the sleigh, thinking it might possibly be Santa Claus. But Santa Claus would come notwithstanding, some time during the night. Did not they know that? Had he ever disappointed them? Oh, when would it be dark, that they might go to bed and pass through an oblivious night to their Christmas morning gifts! Such were the children's thoughts. Seth conducted the stranger at once to his own room, and having provided him with pipes and tobacco, those genuine Dutch weapons for killing time, he left him to his own reflections, or probably to that more perfect state of repose, a vacuity of mind. Still white with unmelted snow, he next entered Harry's apartment, and to the inquiry of the latter, whether he had “found him,” answered only by a wink and a snap of the fingers. “Has no one seen him?” said Harry. “Only father—who mistook him, I think, for you.” “The alderman's sight is failing, certainly,” rejoined Harry, with a laugh. But Harry seemed absent-minded, and Seth and Towser went out to play with the children in the snow. Happy children were they, and a happy fellow was Seth, and quickly did they rear their snowy castle without—poor Towser wagging his tail, and looking joyfully on, little thinking that he was to be shut up within, to whine piteously through a small chink, while the children clapped their hands, and called upon him to chase some imaginary prey. But the hours passed on, and the short day drew to a close, and Jessie was sitting alone in the parlor, pondering deeply, joyously, fearfully. Tears were in her eyes, and strange thoughts and fearful misgivings passed through her mind. But her bounding heart has answered to an approaching step without, and 7 Harry is once more at her side, with a changed countenance and a subdued and faltering voice. Subdued and faltering, although it was but on common topics that he spoke. The weather, the holidays, Seth and his steeds—what was there in these to change the voice of Harry, or to drive the fading hues from Jessie's cheek of snow? But the twilight is growing less, and lower still is Harry's voice, and cruel, cruel are his words—else why those blinding tears of Jessie, and that averted face? What is it that, with fixed gaze, she sees—what can she see through that snow-coated window, and through the snowy air without? Not a word has she answered, not one single word for all the many that Harry has so earnestly spoken, and she has passed, still speechless, from the room, and entered into her own. Safe now in the privacy of her own apartment, her tumultuous emotions gradually subsided, and she knew then, and not till then, how exceeding great was her joy. What was it to her that Harry had lost titles and estates? Not for these bubbles had the wealth of her affection been bartered, and their loss had no power to awaken a sigh in her heart. Others, indeed, would say that Livingston, the wealthy and honored, would never have stooped to wed with her, but what cared she for the slanderous world? She did care, though, a little, for she thought of “the fates,” and she thought of Gertrude's sharp, malicious wit; but deeply at the next moment did she blame herself for yielding to such reflections in the hour of her greatest joy. But there is a knocking at Jessie's door, and a younger brother's eager voice is heard without. He has come with a well-enveloped package, charged only to say that it is a Christmas Box from cousin Harry. Many were the envious wrappers that interposed between the eager fingers of Jessie, and the mysterious treasure; and when all were removed, a beautiful ornamented box of alabaster was revealed, embossed with gold. On opening the lid, glistening against the crimson velvet lining was seen a set of costly jewelry, a necklace of pearls, and a watch and chain of gold, articles which in those days were unknown to any, save the very wealthiest classes. Astonishment and delight held Jessie for a moment breathless, but on looking again she perceived a small folded note in the writing of Livingston. There were but few words within, but they revealed to her the whole overwhelming truth, that Harry, her Harry, rejected of Gertrude, and slighted by the world, was still the rich and powerful patroon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Old Baltus Van Dingle's house had never known such a lighting up as it received on Christmas Eve, in the year 1690. Why should not the old fellow loosen his purse-strings a little? Was there not a prospective patroon to be won, and might he not be secured, if not for one of his own tender daughters, at least for some branch of the family? It would be something, at any rate, to keep him out of the clutch of those Van Corlears. Such were Baltus's thoughts, and he saw no reason, for his part, why Bleecker should not take a fancy to Eve; for Eve certainly was handsome, he said, although a little cross-eyed. Her nose turned up a hair's breadth too much, perhaps, but what of that? He had read of a race of South Sea islanders, whose probosces all pointed zenith-ward, being carefully elevated in infancy by maternal hands. Their noses were turned up, so to speak, against the whole world. Figuratively speaking, if Baltus had ever spoken figuratively, he might have said there were national propensities of that kind, elsewhere than in the South Seas. It would be difficult, even if it were not foreign to the purpose of this history, to give anything like an accurate view of the party at Van Dingle's. Let it suffice that it was a fashionable one for the age, and that many of the stiff and starched aristocracy were there. Not that it in any degree resembled “a jam” of the present century, got up to solve some mathematical problem as to the number of mortals who could possibly stand within four given walls. There may have been thirty people, all told, and counting old Alderman Stoutenburgh only one, who on any fair division would have made three. If they had supper, they sat down to it in an orderly manner, and did not congregate in crowds, peering piggishly over each other's shoulders, at the tempting viands beyond their reach. That swinish simile, however, is hereby rescinded; for politeness may be, and doubtless is, a common feature even of crowds with pinioned elbows. But porkers are really never polite. You couldn't imagine a pig, passing a potato to his companion, with a bow, instead of eating it himself, or disavowing his appetite, and resigning to another an eligible stand at the trough. But this is manifest digression. It might well be supposed that Derick would be a little backward about strutting in his borrowed plumes before such an assemblage, but he was the most reckless of fellows, and could not deny himself this choice bit of fun. It was to be positively his last appearance on any stage, and he meant to make the most of it. He was exceedingly cautious, however, not to excite undue expectations in the susceptible hearts of any of his fair suitors. Studiously polite was the new patroon on all hands, and none could claim and none complain of any monopoly of his attentions. Dimples or wrinkles, all were the same to Derick. Even Katrina Van Derspeigle did not melt him; and what was more provoking to the fates, she did not try. While Gertrude was discharging repeated broadsides of witty speeches and tender glances at the enemy, and the Van Dingles were momentarily dreading to see him strike his flag, and drop alongside, their own powerful ally was sailing off in another direction, and levelling the whole artillery of her charms at another foe. And who was that, do you ask? Why, who should it be but Seth—our Seth, whose good-natured face had made its appearance in the crowd, much to the astonishment of all. He had come by virtue of a general invitation to the family, and was, as he everywhere was, very welcome. Some cool inquiries were necessarily made of him as to Mr. Livingston's health and welfare, to which he replied in terms which, although seemingly quite explicit, threw no light whatever upon Harry's whereabout. The subject was not urged, for, as may well be supposed, it was very delicate ground to tread upon; quite, indeed, of the quicksand order, both to Gertrude and the fates. Miss Katrina's fancy for Seth seemed to be fully reciprocated; for she was a warm-hearted, generous little girl, full of fun, and, as the event proved, not at all disposed to be kept in leading-strings by her two staid senior cousins. Eve copied her graceful gambols, and played off seventeen in quite a frisky, kittenly manner. 'Twould be a match—Seth and Katrina—everybody could see that at a glance. The question was settled. The stockings that were full of gold, and the stockings that were not full of gold, were all done for. That sub-treasurer was appointed, and all other candidates might thenceforth retire, as they very discreetly did, and seemed quite oblivious of ever having made any advances in the premises whatever. Gertrude was in high spirits. She had recovered from the shock occasioned by the late laceration of her affections, and was entirely herself again. Never had she been more beautiful, and never had the coruscations of her wit been more brilliant. So confident had she grown in the power of her fascinations, that she considered her prize already won, although, doubtless for good reasons, there were as yet no outward signs of such a result. Not a little did she congratulate herself on the master-stroke of policy, by which, “in the very nick of time,” she had got rid of poor Harry. She would really, however, see that Bleecker did something nice for him when he came to the property. And while looking idly around the room for a moment, she made a little mental memorandum to tell Jessie how disconsolate poor Harmon seemed, sitting as stiff and as still as the tongs in one corner for the whole evening, and all because she was absent. Aunt Schermerhorn was there, but the poor old soul had scarcely a chance to speak to dear Bleecker, so thronged was he by the belles. She found an opportunity at last, however, and pressed boldly up, because she felt that she was the bearer of good news. “Who on airth do you think has come?” she said, addressing Derick: “who, of all the world! and so anxious to see you?” Derick could not guess, but looked a little startled. “Why, old cousin Bartholomew, of Schagticoke!” “The d—l!” exclaimed Derick; “that is to say, I'm delighted, I mean,” as he caught sight of his father, hobbling slowly across the room. “He's very anxious to see you, for sure,” said the old lady. Just behind Derick and his bevy of beauties, and nearly opposite to where the old man had entered the room, was another door, near which stood Seth and Katrina. “I shall be transported with delight to see the old gentleman,” rejoined Derick, who had now regained his easy self-possession; “beg him to wait for me one moment.” “Where is he? where is he?” grumbled forth the old man, with a bull-frog sort of voice; “let's see him, cousin Polly.” “My horses are at the door,” whispered Seth, as Derick glided past him, answering only with a wink and a smile. “Where is he?” repeated the stranger triumphantly, as much as to say, “It's all humbug, you can't show me any such person.” Amazed at Bleecker's inexplicable conduct, no one replied, and the old man, who had caught sight of his retiring son, at once hurried off in pursuit. The room continued silent, a sound of voices was heard without, then the jingling of bells, and old Bartholomew came stumping back. “I saw him; I saw him,” he said, laughing loudly; “it's my son Derick, Polly!—didn't you know Derick?” “La! so it is!” exclaimed Aunt Schermerhorn. “Talk to me about Bleecker Van Ness!” continued the old man, excitedly; “don't I know that he has been dead, coming seven years next Spring? Haven't I seen a copy of the what-d'ye-call-it there, of the coroner that sot on him on the coast of Ireland, with a dozen others, taken off the wreck of the Iris—pshaw!” and with this polite valedictory he left the room. The consternation, fortunately for Gertrude, was too general at first to admit of her own alarm being especially noticed, for her sensations of shame and anguish were really stunning in their intensity. She felt herself going up, as it were, with an exploded mine, and anticipating momentarily the shock of the descent. Duped, fooled, exposed to the ridicule of all, had but the floor and earth yawned beneath her then, she would have leaped, gladly, into the chasm. She managed soon to make her escape from the room, whence poor Eve had already fled. Katrina, who had no cause for mortification, stood her ground boldly, supported by Seth, and together with the remaining part of the company, who were gathered in little knots about the room, continued for some time to discuss these remarkable occurrences. The opportune appearance of old Bartholomew had been in part only the result of Seth's management. He had come down to the city, influenced by the combined motives of a desire to visit his relations, to find his scape-grace son, and to dispose of a load of frozen poultry for the Christmas and New Year's markets. Seth had accidentally heard of his presence in the city, through Van Bummel, and had secured his attendance in the manner that has been described, instructing him at what time to make his appearance. Derick was not in the secret of the last scene, which was a little private fun got up by Seth for his own amusement. He could think, indeed, of no better way to bring about the dénouement, which ought not to be longer deferred, and if he subjected his coadjutor to a little extra embarrassment, he at least provided him with a ready way of escape. Although the shock to Gertrude was violent, she soon began to rally. She reflected, while on her way home, that, fortunately, Derick had paid her no very marked attention, and that whatever suspicion might exist, there was no proof of her having had any designs upon him. No one, she thought, but Jessie, even knew of her quarrel with Livingston, and she by no means despaired of regaining her lost ground in that quarter. Harry was a good easy soul, and was, no doubt, still pining for her, and if she could only once meet him, she had but little fear for the result. What then was her surprise and joy, on entering her own parlor, to behold Harry, whom she had supposed to be on the Canadian frontier, sitting quietly beside Jessie laughing and talking, and seeming very much at home. How truly, she thought, had she estimated his character. “Most magnanimous of men!” she exclaimed, throwing herself into a graceful attitude, and applying her kerchief to her eyes, “do I indeed find you here awaiting my return? How can such generosity ever be repaid?” Poor simple Jessie, accustomed to defer, in all things, to her imperious sister, actually trembled for one unreflecting moment, lest Harry should relent. It was but a moment. “Miss Van Corlear has no reason to applaud my magnanimity,” said Livingston, rising and speaking slowly; “she has not found me here awaiting her return—or expecting it—or entertaining any other feeling in regard to her movements than that of the most perfect indifference.” If a railroad locomotive could be endued with consciousness and sensation at the moment of bounding off the track under a forty mile per hour headway, it would doubtless feel very much as Gertrude did at this moment. For she had been quite in earnest in her belief as to the object of Livingston's return. But his words now, and his manner, and the frightened looks of Jessie, and the tout-ensemble of affairs around her, convinced her that there was no hope. Overwhelmed with mortification, yet partially sustained by her invisible handmaiden, Pride, she beat a rapid retreat to her room. On the next morning, notwithstanding it was Christmas day, she made good her escape to the city, under plea of some engagement with Aunt Schermerhorn, with whom she had the good sense to remain for the next three weeks. At the end of that period, on a fine cold morning of January, a very noble but very restless pair of horses and a very sumptuous sleigh packed with divers trunks and boxes, were seen standing in front of Van Corlear's house, thronged by peering children and servants, much to the annoyance of a pompous negro driver, who begged them to have the goodness to stand a little back, and make way for the pat-ter-roon and his lady. And he spoke none too soon; for the front door had opened, and Harry and Jessie, muffled and cloaked for travel, and Burley and his vrow, and Seth and the children and Towser, came crowding out, all full of a few last words, not excepting the dog, whose remarks were probably about as intelligible just then as those of his companions. Jessie was a little paler than usual, for the marriage ceremony had but just been performed, but the cold air soon brought back her color and her spirits. “Mind, Seth, we shall see you in the Spring?” she called back as the horses began to move. “And Katrina,” added Harry. Seth colored, and making a significant gesture to the driver, the latter brought around his whip with a double-extra flourish, and they were gone. They are gone, gentle reader, “for sure.” We shall never see them again. Seth saw them, however, the very next Spring, and so did Katrina, and very welcome visiters they were too at Kenterhook, and many was the merry day's sport with horse and hound, that Harry and Seth enjoyed in the wild forests which formed a part of the Livingston manor. Burley was perfectly contented and perfectly happy in the fulfilment of his ambitious dreams. The patroon was his son-in-law, although it is doubtful whether or not he ever fully comprehended the affair. Indeed he was too wise to trouble himself about processes as long as his end was gained. Gertrude was fully humbled, but it is to be feared, was not much reformed, until later years. After many ineffectual attempts at conquest, she contented herself with acquiring the legal right to teaze the little remaining life out of poor Harmon Van Dingle, a labor of love which proved neither very arduous, nor very long protracted. Derick retired to private life, not fully reconciled to his loss of wealth and station, or altogether free from self-reproach. That his duplicity had produced a good result, could not, he properly argued, render it justifiable; but he consoled himself by the belief that his wild oats were now all sown, and he determined henceforth to turn his attention to more profitable crops. He became, indeed, a good, orderly citizen, although with such talents for intrigue and diplomacy, he would, undoubtedly, under other circumstances, have made no small ado in the world. Had he lived in our day, his path to political distinction would have been unobstructed, unless, possibly, by the pre-occupancy of a few kindred spirits. The two senior fates continued single; but on the sudden death of old Baltus, a few years later, bachelor Van Bummel, finding that the estate would cut up into pretty large slices, made some very abrupt proposals for Eve, which that young lady, with modest avidity, accepted. She could not call to mind exactly on what occasion she had captivated the lawyer, but as she had long considered him to be a gentleman of taste and discrimination, she was in no wise surprised at his choice. Marriage meliorated the harshness of Eve's disposition very materially, and her husband, who had long tried the flowerless path of celibacy, was tolerably well contented with his fate. If she was not the very best of wives, the land at least was of a good quality, and in this world, thought Van Bummel, we must take the bitter with the sweet.</field>
