      <field name="fulltext">ADRIAN, THE NEOPHYTE. BY GEORGE LIPPARD, ESQ., AUTHOR OF “HERBERT TRACY,” ETC. There was a Poet whose untimely tomb No human hands with pious reverence rear'd. — — No mourning maiden deck'd With weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath, The lone couch of his everlasting sleep; Gentle, and brave and generous, no lorn bard Breath'd over his dark fate one melodious sigh; He lived, he died— — (The Nameless One.) In the gallery of the monastery of St. Benedict, in the City of Florence the Fair, the eye of the traveller is fixed in mute interest and wonder, upon the strange contrast presented by four ancient paintings. They are embodied in a legend of wild and startling mystery, for it is said— (Adventures in Italy.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST PICTURE. A Youth is standing amid the warm sunlight of a Cathedral aisle. Images of Religion and sacred pomp are around him—a calm light plays upon his unwrinkled brow, and you behold—the Enthusiast of Religion. THE LIGHT OF THE PICTURE. It was in the ancient time, when Religion dwelt in the shadows of the solemn temple, and the lofty fane, and made her home amid the recesses of age-worn altars, the time of glorious deeds and magnificent superstitions, when Romance came forth from the minds of men, and walked abroad, a thing of visible life, the age of war and love and song, on the afternoon of a bright summer's day, that a young Student paced the aisles of a gorgeous cathedral, with slow and measured steps, while the melancholy echoes sprang from pillar to pillar, and leaped from gloomy arch to shadowy niche. Advancing from the shadow of a massive column, the student paused for a moment, where the warm sunbeams, streaming thro' a lofty window, gaudy with rare emblazonings, fell with all their golden light, over a simple altar, tinting the opened missal with a ruddy glow, and flinging a halo around the cross, which rose above the altar like a thing of sacred hopes and hallowed affections. As the student paused in his walk, and standing in front of the altar, clasped his hands upon his priestly robe, in reverence of the holy symbol, the sunbeams fell warmly upon the outline of his youthful figure, and his face, with its darkened hue, the forehead broad and high, and pale with thought, relieved by clustering masses of lustrous brown hair, sweeping in ringlets to his shoulders, the marked eyebrows curving with the frown of meditation, the dark grey eyes, brilliant with fancy, the bold nose, the expressive mouth, and the rounded chin, all were shown in the warm glow of the golden light; and the head and features of the Neophyte stood out from the background of gloom and shadow, like a picture, wrought by the hand of an inspired master. He bowed his head, low on his breast, and raising his clasped hands in the sunlight, in a low and deep-toned voice, he spoke— “A solemn place and a hallowed hour”—he murmured in that rich, melodious voice, with which the full heart ever whispers its mysteries to the silent air.—“A solemn place, and a hallowed hour. Let others chose the glittering scenes of the courtly hall, the music of the war-trump, or the glare of the gay and flitting world. For me —Ah, thanks to the Ever-Living, whose emblem is the Holy Cross—For me, my home is made amid the solitude of these quiet aisles and solemn arches. The music of the organ, lofty and sublime, fills my soul with vague and dreamy emotions—more solemn, more grand, because most vague and dreamy. And the scenes of the far-extending procession where golden crosses glitter, and sacred banners wave—the High Mass when the Host is elevated, while the million bow their heads in speechless adoration—the still melancholy of the vesper hour, when the dying day with its thousand sounds, re-echoes the twilight calls to prayer—ah, these scenes to me are far more dear, far more hallowed than all the pomp, the show, and the glitter of the world.” And raising his full grey eyes solemnly upward, while his youthful face, warming with all the inspiration that lightens the soul whose thoughts are in the far-world of the unreal, glowed and brightened in the light of the mellow sunbeams, in a voice made holy by intense and absorbing feeling, the Neophyte exclaimed— “Thanks be unto God, the Ever-Living— thanks be unto the Saviour, called the Blessed— and unto the Holy Mary, the Pure Woman and the Sublime Divinity; the thanks of the heart, and the adoration of the soul be rendered; now and forevermore.” “Benedicite!” said a calm and solemn voice— “Benedicite, my son!” The youth turned and beheld an aged man clad in robes of undimmed white, with the mitre of an Abbot, surmounting his high and thoughtful brow. His blue eyes gleamed with the calm light of a soul that knows no thoughts save those that are of the Awful Unseen, while floating along his wrinkled cheeks and over his shoulders, the locks of snow white hair, gave grandeur and dignity to the appearance of the holy man. “Holy Father, thy son returns thee thanks and blessing!” said the youth in a solemn tone as he bowed low before the venerable Abbot. “Adrian my son,” said the Abbot, in the mild, soft voice of a father, speaking to a beloved child, “like the sweet sound of far-off music, melting away among twilight hills comes the voice of youthful enthusiasm over my heart. Adrian, my boy, thy voice is now deep-toned, and thy heart throbs with the warm feeling of youth—how oft have I heard the voice of youth, deep-toned as thine, change to the shrill and piercing laugh of reckless despair— how oft have I noted hearts throbbing with youth and hope like thine, wither and die, beneath the cold death-chill of the first heart-break. But with thee Adrian this may never be.” THE GLORY. “Never, father, thanks be to Him above, never!” said the Neophyte solemnly raising his eyes to the vaulted roof—“Here amid the holy cloisters have I grown from infancy to youth—here when thought and memory first awoke within me, did I wander silently beneath the shadow of the Holy Cross, and here afar from the world, afar from the strife of men, afar from the woe, the wrong, the passion, the despair that attends Life in her pilgrimage without these hallowed walls, here will I die! Here, while the sound of the swelling organ, and the melody of the vesper hymn break on my freezing ear—the last of earthly sounds— here, where my last look shall be met by the vision of the solemn cross, made more glorious by the beams of the setting sun, here will the orphan give back to God, the spirit which he gave, without a sigh, without a pang. Father, mother, brother, sister, have I none—but—” “God is thy Father—Christ the Blessed thy Brother—the Virgin thy Mother!” And as the grey-haired Abbot passed his thin and withered hands along the brow of the Neophyte with the gesture of benediction, a tear dimmed the eye of the youth, but it was a tear of holy joy, of sublime enthusiasm, a tear of hope and heaven-born love—and as that tear sparkled between the eyelids of the youthful face, it shone like a star, trembling along the pathway of the skies. “Adrian, my son—” the Abbot continued, as they paced toward the emblazoned window— “Thy life has been a strange mystery. Since the day—the cold winter's day, when the friendless foundling first entered these walls—well do I remember it! 'Tis now more than nineteen years gone,—on the return of the next Mass of Christ 'twill be twenty years—since that dark and desolate day, thou hast not passed beyond the cloisters of this our monastery of St. Benedict, in the good city of Florence the Fair. The world with its good and evil is all unknown to thee, save from the rare knowledge gained from the tomes of the sacred library. And yet thou hast made passing wondrous advancement in the holy mystery of music. Who in this good city may wake such sounds of melody from the chords of the harp, as swell along the air when the strings are touched by thy fingers? Nay, blush not, my son—'tis no mock-praise I offer thee. Who in all our House of St. Benedict, may illuminate the holy missal of devotion, with such rare emblazonings as warm the parchment when touched by thy pencil? Thou art a strangely gifted youth, my brother—nay, my son—and thy life has been a wondrous mystery. Still when I look on that young brow of thine, methinks there must be, within thy heart a lurking desire, to mingle with the world without the convent walls? What sayst Adrian?” The Neophyte turned to the Abbot, and as he turned the warm glow of the setting sun, fell in a veil of light over his features. As he stood there on the tesselated pavement, with every lineament of his countenance brightening with enthusiasm, the grey eyes sparkling with the light of inward soul, the lips parted with sudden rapture, the cheek flushed, and the brow unclouded, as thus he stood with his hands upraised and his youthful form elevated with a feeling of heaven-born dignity, the holy father looked upon him, and started as he thought, how much the youth seemed like the pictures of the Saint John, which were hung along the gallery of the convent. “Mingle with the world without, reverend father!” exclaimed the Neophyte—“A wish ever cross my heart to mingle with its scenes of earthly triumph, and earthly toil? Look around, holy father, and gaze upon this sacred place! Above, the fretted roof wrapped in gloom and shadow— beneath, the tesselated pavement, with soft gleams of sunlight breaking the misty veil that is thrown around the lofty pillars—yonder the high altar, with its cross—See! how the light of the setting sun gleams over the face of the Blessed One!— Look around, father, and mark this solemn place, with its light and its gloom—its pillars rich with age-worn sculpturings—its rare paintings, where Genius waits at Devotion's shrine—its altar and its cross—its sublime roof—and then father as you mark the solemn silence that rests upon this hour, think, here has been my home since infancy! Here have I wandered while visions of God lifted my soul to that Brighter World—at the foot of yonder cross have I knelt prostrate while the glories of the Unreal have been bared to the eye of Faith! Look, holy father, look, and then think how poor, how vile the soul, that would prefer the scenes of the world without to the holy hours of this awful temple!” THE SHADOW. “And yet, my son, thou must endure the trial! Well thou knowest the rule of our order which declares, that once in a hundred years, a brother shall be selected from among the brotherhood, to take a vow, yet more solemn, more awful than the vow uttered by a simple monk. It is the vow of eternal separation from the world, and from sight of the faces of men. Hidden in his solitary cell, the One Set-apart, shall pass his days, his nights, in one unending solitude, save that once in every year, it is enjoined upon him, to appear unto the sight of the world, for one hour, while from the pulpit of the Grand Chapel of the Cathedral, he shall speak to the multitude of the wonderful revelations made to his soul in the passing year. From thy childhood, Adrian, thou hast been selected as the one set-apart. One month hence thou wilt take this solemn vow of eternal separation. Yet stay—there is another condition to be complied with first. It is the rule of our Order that the month previous to the taking of the vow, shall be spent, by the Neophyte, amid the glare and glitter of the world. When the end of that period arrives, should the One Set-apart still desire to take the solemn vow, 'tis well. But should his heart fail him, after his eye has feasted upon the vanities of life—then it is also well. He may recede; he may refuse to take the vow, and God will still be honored, for He asks of his children, none other than a willing service. To-morrow Adrian, the Carnival begins, here in Florence.— And to-morrow, Adrian, thou wilt commence the TRIAL.” The Neophyte bowed low, and folded his hands upon his priestly robe. “Come hither, Adrian, to this emblazoned window. The sun has set, in the west, and the new moon gleams through the azure. When that moon has attained her full orbed glory, here in this solemn cathedral—thy month of trial passed —on the last day of the Carnival, when the folly and mirth of that mad time shall have swelled to universal riot and revel, then, if thou art still firm, in this temple shalt thou take the solemn vow— the oath of oaths—and all Florence shall hail thee as the sacred—as the One Set-apart!” “So may it be, my holy father!” said the Neophyte with a voice of prayer. “Adrian I have thought of this, thy solemn trial with much pain. A dim and shadowy fear has crossed my mind, that thou wert not strong enough for the ordeal. Yet methinks, I have discovered a way which hedged in as it is by the fires of the ordeal, may still guide thee through the trial unscathed. Hast ever heard of the fair Countess Rose, Heiress of the Palaces and Lands of Ellarini?” “Father,” replied the youth, “in the still solitudes of these walls, but little of the gossip of the world without breaks upon the student's ear.— Still it were hard to wait at the altar, where the gay cavaliers of Florence throng to worship, without hearing the name of the Lady Rose, which is whispered by every gay tongue, and repeated by every gallant voice. The fame of her beauty has been echoed even within the shadows of these walls.” “One month hence, my son, the Countess Di Ellarini will succeed to the broad lands of her deceased father. On the last day of the Carnival, the Holy Church will celebrate the sacrament of matrimony between this fair lady, and the gallant Lord Urban Di Capello—Hast heard his name!” “All Florence repeat the praises of the rich lord—and report speaks him young and handsome.” “Well, my son—thus runs my story. It is the desire of the fair lady, to procure from our convent a brother skilled in the mystery of music. I know none more gifted than thou. Haste thee away to the Palace Di Ellarini. Thy name will gain thee audience with the fair lady—commence thy instructions this very night. Thy harp shall be sent after thee as well as thy missals of devotion, by the hands of a lay brother. Thou art to remain in the palace, until the last day of the Carnival, save that one hour each night, thou art to spend in thy cell in this convent. And now my son away—yet, hold, I will open this postern door.” THE GLOOM. And a small door, curiously fixed amid the intricate panelling, along the side of the lofty casement, flew suddenly open, and the beams of the rising moon flung a line of silvery light through the aperture over the pavement of the cathedral. The Neophyte advanced. One foot rested upon the threshold. Beyond was the world. Mountains sleeping in the moonlight—shadowy vallies—streams of silver. The azure sky and the silvery moon.— The distant horizon where the outline of the heavens was broken by uprising columns of ruined temples—the foreground of the view, where the foliage of a massive forest, floated with undulations, like those of the ocean wave. His foot was upon the threshold. His face to the world, his back to the cathedral, with its far-extending pavement its roof supported by giant columns, its gleams of light, and its masses of shadow. “Farewell, place of glooms, scene of glories.— Home of my heart—farewell. Bless me, father!” And as he looked over his shoulders backward, into the gloom of the cathedral, the hands of the Abbot were laid upon his dark brown locks, while his eyes were raised to heaven in prayer. “Thou goest forth pure, my son, come thou back unscathed! The God in Heaven grant it!” A loud, wild laugh, broke on the air, directly over the heads of the abbot and the neophyte.— It awoke the solemn echoes, and rang along the cathedral arches, like a sound from the Spirit. Land. “Ha! my son, what unreal mockery is that? Hark! how it echoes along the cathedral aisles!” “My father, that unearthly laugh thrills through me, as though my blood were turned to ice. In old legends I have read, that the echoes of this solemn cathedral are aroused by laughter wild and dread as this, but once in an hundred years. It is a sound of fearful omen—the laugh of Despair, bidding Hope farewell!” And as the beams of the rising moon, floating through the opened doorway, shone over the aged form of the Abbot, robed in white, and for a moment touched the deep black tunic of the neophyte with gleams of silver, that wild, dread laugh echoed along the cathedral aisles again and yet again; the youth cast one look back into the cloister, and then sprung over the threshold; while behind was heard the sound of the closing door, and around, startling the still air of night, with its fearful discord, broke that sound of unreal laughter, commingling with a hollow whisper that had its origin in no mortal voice. “Forth thou goest Youth—High in Heart— Bold in Thought! Thou comest back—and a crushed heart and a withered soul are thine—Ha —Ha—Ha!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND PICTURE. A lonely cell, lighted by a dim taper. The figure of the first picture is sitting silent and alone; his head drooped low, and his arms folded on his breast—a mingled light and gloom is upon his brow. You have before your eyes —the Enthusiust of Love EARTH DARKENS HEAVEN. The student sat in his lonely cell. The hour was silent as the grave, and a faint cresset, hung from the side of a massive pillar, rough with age and worn by time, flung its faint and scanty beams over the face of the Neophyte, while the farther recesses of the solitary home were wrapt in gloom and shadow. Adrian sat upon a bench of stone, projecting from the dark grey wall, with his head drooped low upon his breast, his right hand lay clenched upon his knee, and the left drooping heavily by his side, while the fingers of the hand carelessly entwined a beaded rosary, which fell to the earth, with the holy cross resting neglected upon the floor of stone. The dark grey eyes of the student glared fixedly from beneath the eyebrows set together in a frown, the thin lips tightly compressed, quivered and trembled with a wild nervous movement, while over his youthful face and open brow, a deathly paleness rested like a veil, and the lamp-beams tinted with a ruddy light the folds of his dark robe, heaved upwards by the throbbings of thought, that awoke the demon within his breast. “I have seen her!” were the words that broke murmuringly from his half closed lips—but oh, how changed and hollow was his voice, since you heard it last in the Cathedral aisle—“I have seen the Beauty of Florence—The Rose of Ellarini! I have seen her, beautiful and peerless as a vision —I have sat by her side, have drank the glance of her full dark eye, and looked upon the glow of her cheek! These fingers have trembled with hers, as they ran, all alive with music, along the chords of the breathing harp! I have seen her —and in my heart is hell, and in my brain is fire!” He paused, and his hands were clasped wildly across his breast, while the strained sinews seemed bursting from the skin with the wild effort. And then gazing upward with a look full of utter abandonment of soul, and in a voice made thrilling by the despair of a soul, that sinks to night, within the sight of Heaven, in a voice hollow and ghastly, yet broken ever and anon, by tones of pathos, that would have thrilled a heart of stone to hear, he exclaimed, raising his hands on high— “Oh, God—no longer mine—where now is my Religion? My beautiful religion of dreams and shadows? My faith of light? My belief of holy love and hallowed hope? Where are they now? Where the calm soul, and the heart that erewhile knew no care? Where is now my hope—my heaven—my life? Gone—gone—all gone! THE DREAM OF EARTH. “And on the throne of my soul, sits a fair image—but not of Christ or God! An image of beauty with shadowy eyes—full, liquid and black as night—eyes that dart passion; and lips, ruby with health, parting like severed rose buds, and murmuring tones of music, that madden my very brain! “And oh, along each cheek, flushing with life, are floating tresses of midnight hair—dark night mingling with the first warming flush of rose-hued day—and a single tress, dark, waving, and glossy, falls twining round her neck of alabaster, and rests in all its beauty upon the bosom with its globes of snow. 'Twas thus when I saw her last—but an hour since! That tress rises with the throb of thought—it sinks with the ebbing sigh. 'Tis the dark buoy of her soul, floating o'er passion's wave, floating above the depths, where passion's hopes lie anchored! And she never can be mine!” He started to his feet and paced the floor. The rosary fell from his hand, and the cross rang with a clanging sound upon the tesselated stone. “Holy cross”—he cried, starting round and gazing wildly upon the fallen emblem—“To me thou hast been full of high hope and hallowed joy. Father nor mother, brother nor sister hath the orphan, but I have looked upon thee, and He on Calvary stood before me, the Virgin was by my side, the Presence of God was around me. These were father, mother, sister and brother, to me—and I was happy. Now! Oh, God! she never can be mine!” Again and again he paced the floor of stone, again were his hands clasped wildly across his breast, and his voice once more startled the air with its sounds of mockery and despair. “Lord Urban Di Capello”—he murmured— “Rich, young, fair-tongued, and gallant in bearing! The pride of Florence—the boast of her chivalry! And can he love her? As I love, can he love? Would he give his soul, his heaven, his all—in life or death—would he give his God for her? He loves as the gay gallant can love—but all this madness of passion—this phantasy of affection— this despair of heart—these can never wake a thought within his bosom! Urban of Capello— Rose of Ellarini! May the God of Heaven pity me—but my soul is lost! And sinking on the marble floor, in the solemn voice of the olden time, the student sent up his soul to Heaven in prayer, and as the memories of Religion, the sanctities of enthusiasm, and the imaginings of hallowed hope, fell wild and trembling from his lips, the warm and gushing tears came streaming from his eyes, and—Adrian the Neophyte was with the olden time again. “I will forget her!” he exclaimed, bounding on his feet—“I will see her again and again, and as I look upon her, I will conquer this madness of soul! The struggle is hard—the reward is grand! Adrain, the Neophyte, will come forth from the ordeal of fire, unscathed and unharmed! And now I will away to the mountain solitudes! No sleep for me this night—but the clear sky and the free air! I am ready for the ordeal!” And as he sprang with a bounding step, thro' the narrow door of his cell, his full grey eye flashed with the light of hope, and his cheek with the ruddy glow of youth, but — The hollow laugh of supernatural omen broke over the silence of the cell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD PICTURE. A princely hower—arabesque columns, wreathed with flowering vines. A youth and maiden are the figures of the picture. He clasps her hand, and a strange gloom is upon his brow. The enthusiasm of Religion and Love are past—this may be the enthusiasm of Despair. “Sir monk, methinks thy harp is wondrously out of tune! By my fay, thy fingers tremble like leaves of the aspen tree—thy visage is the semblance of gravity itself. Ah! me—how grave thou art! Nay —nay, doff that solemn look, and, with thy priestly face wreathed in smiles, sing me a merry song of love, of chivalry, or war, as it shall please thee. Mother Mary, but thy harp is wondrously out of tune!” “Blame not the harp fair Ladye—my thoughts were far away, and—” “Beshrew me, that was a peach-like blush, sir monk! Ha—ha—ha!” And as the light-hearted laugh of the maiden rang through the bower-hall, the student, attired in robes of priestly black, kneeling beside the harp, along whose chords his fingers ran tremblingly, raised his head from his task, and looking over his shoulder, glanced at the face and form of Rose, the Flower of Ellarini. Seated upon a sofa of costly velvet, in an attitude of careless ease, the Ladye Rose turned her face of laughing beauty toward the Neophyte. There were the full, dark eyes, beaming with liquid light, the locks of raven blackness, falling along one dimpling check, with the relief of a snow-white lily gleaming from its shadow, while from the other check, warming with life, the midnight tresses were swept back and gathered within the confines of a circlet of gold, mingling with drops of pearl, that encircled her head, shining like stars from the midnight of her hair. The folds of a loosened robe, gemmed with carelessly-strung jewels, floated around the outline of her young form, sweeping gracefully over the fullness of the youthful bosom, and drooping in slight folds along the slender waist, while down to her delicate feet the garment fell in many a circle of grace and fold of beauty, giving witchery and fascination to the slightest movement or faintest gesture of the proud and peerless Ladye Rose. A round the maiden were images of luxury and splendor. The warm light of the declining day, streaming between the fantastic pillars which separated the bower from the open portico without, fell mild and golden around the Mosaic pavement, and flung its mellow beams amid the shadows of the fragrant vine, creeping along each arabesque column, and hanging from the carved and painted ceiling in many a gay wreath and light festoon. The breath of roses and the perfume of lilies were upon the air, and the hushed breeze lay sleeping in the tendrils of the vine, or the cup of the flower, while afar, gleaming beyond the open balcony, was the gorgeous landscape, with its woods and its streams, its mountains and its vallies, all glowing warm and golden in the flush of the setting sun. Adrian looked up and gazed upon the face of nature, with her thousand beauties, her flowers of graceful shape and rainbow hues, her shadowy woods, her streams of silver, her golden sunlight, and her azure sky. “These all,” he murmured, “are mine, the wild delight of forest and flower, sky and stream, all are mine!” Adrian glanced upon the maiden. “She breathes to mine eye,” he murmured, “a fair combination of the beautiful in nature, a magnificent reality of the dream of thought. The sunlight's smile is on her ruby lip, the morning's glow on her check of youth, the grandeur of the star of night flashes from her eye. Beautiful she is, fair and graceful, a thin; of light and love. But she never can be mine!” “Sir stndent, you are absent,” exclaimed the light-ringing voice of the Countess Rose. “By my troth, 'tis well thy life is destined for the solitude of the convent walls. A gallant thou wert never made. What! still silent? Thrice have I craved a song of thee, sir monk—” “Pardon me, fair lady,” exclaimed Adrian, passing his fingers along the harp-chords. “The humble student hath not at all times the entire control of his thoughts. The will of the Lady Rose is the pleasure of the monk Adrian. I will sing you a song of free-hearted joy and careless mirth.” And seating himself beside the harp, the Neophyte passed his fingers lightly along the chords, and a strain of gay and bounding melody floated around the vine-clad pillars of the bower hall. His face glowed with an expression of careless glee, as, in a voice full of manly music, he gave the words of an ancient melody to the air. Sing me a song of the summer day, When mirth springs forth in her sunlit way, And the woods resound with the voice of glee, And the breeze blows soft, and the stream rolls free. The summer day, with its halcyon hours— Its hours of calm; Its fragrant dews and its rainbow flowers— Its flow'rs of balm. Earth, and air, and sky, are gay, All in the soft midsummer day.[1] [1] In this song, and the ensuing “Death Chaunt of the Soul,” the author neither pretends to peculiar originality of thought, melody of rhyme, or beauty of structure. It was his object to imitate some of the rude rhymes of the feudal ages, with all their abruptness of thought and diction. The words were plain and simple, but the full and manly voice of the Neophyte floating along the hall, commingling with the strains of the harp, gave them force and volume; and the Lady Rose leaned forward with interest, while an expression of quiet attention and delight came over her beautiful countenance. “Thy song is a merry one, sir student,” whispered the maiden; “and the melody is one of gladsome music.” The Neophyte lowered his head for a moment, and when he raised it again the light of the sun fell warmly on the face of the enthusiast, and his dark grey eyes brightened and glowed with a strange and shadowy expression, as the wild strains of his harp gave life and animation to the words of a monkish chaunt, which the student had gleaned from some ancient missal of the monastery of St. Benedict. THE DEATH-CHAUNT OF THE SOUL. I. In dreams, one winter night, Methought a solemn bell did toll A death-knell, wild and dark— The corse a soul—a LIFELESS SOUL. II. A soul that in its coffin lay, Made of the wondrous Tree of Life; Fruits and flowers were o'er it strown— The flowers of love, and fruits of strife. III. Methought the corse arose, And, with its shadowy face, Smiled on a phantom band, Who thronged the ghastly place. IV. Images of Love were clust'ring there, Phantoms of Hope and wither'd Care; And' brooding o'er the coffin's-head, With leaden look, sate wan Despair. V. And then the corse sent up a wail— A wail to Him unknown; And cursed the light that gave it birth, With gibbering laugh and moan. VI. And then methought the unseen bell Did sad and mournful toll; While the phantoms gathered round— Mourners o'er the lifeless soul. “Sir monk, thy chaunt is a strange and dark one. My blood runs cold, as I listen to thy harp strains, floating wildly and sadly along the silence of this hall. Beshrew me, but thou art passing melancholy in thy taste, this summer even.” “Fair lady, in good troth, my chaunt was somewhat solemn and wild, but solemnity and thought are ever wedded to the calmness of the twilight hour.” A shade of thought came over the features of the fair girl, and she regarded the bronzed face and dark grey eyes of the Neophyte with a look of strange and mysterious interest. “And thou art doomed to pass thy days, which should be given to youth and hope, within the shadows of the convent walls?” “Doomed! fair lady?” Adrian repeated, echoing her words. “Doomed, indeed!” he murmured to himself, in a tone of thrilling emphasis. “And canst thou, young sir, resign the pleasures of youth, of hope, without a sigh?” “Without a sigh?” murmured Adrian, turning his face from the glow of the sun, and drooping his head low on his breast to conceal the agitation that worked like a spasm along his countenance. “Sir monk, thou art moved?” exclaimed the Ladye Rose, with a winning smile, that gave faint glimpses of her ivory teeth. “Would that I knew his thoughts!” she whispered to herself. “Can the passions or the feelings of youth find a lurking-place under that solemn countenance? Can another glance than that of devotion flash from the clear grey eye? I will try him!” And as the thought flashed over her mind, she arose from the couch of velvet, with a graceful motion, and with one light tripping footstep attained the side of the Neophyte. “Sir monk, thou art moved with some strange emotion?” she said, in a kind and winning voice. The student trembled with a feeling of strange and new delight, but still raised not his head. “Thou art my spiritual father, in troth,” she continued with a light-hearted laugh; “yet thy face is not a shade older than mine. 'Twere but a merry jest to call thee father, therefore I will address thee by thine own name. Nay, good sir, turn not thy head away. Adrian, Rose of Ellarini asks what is't that moves thee?” And with her fair, white hand, she parted the brown locks over the student's brow. “She speaks mine own name!” he murmured. “Her hand is on my brow—her large black eyes are fixed on mine! O, God!—I shall fall to the earth. Have mercy, Heaven, or the dream will drive me mad!” “Adrian, you answer me with silence!” “Nay, lady—'twas but a memory of some far-gone dream of my early youth that awoke this sudden feeling within me.” “Adrian, 'tis now the last week of the carnival. Thou hast been a wondrous faithful teacher, though I, mayhap, have not been as dutiful a pupil. Many songs of melody have I learned of thee, and thine art of waking sweet sounds from the harp chords, has in some measure become mine. 'Tis not of this I would speak to ye now. Ye monks, cut off as ye are from the pleasures of the world, are wont to revive them in the pages of the illuminated romance. Hast thou amused thyself thus, Adrian? In the book-room of St. Benedict, is there no parchment-leaved volume, gandy with rare emblazoning that owes its creation to thy fancy?” “Lady, thou hast judged aright.” “Adrian, I would thou hadst some merry tale of love and war with thee now. The sun is dipping behind the mountains, and a story of the olden time would well become the twilight hour.” “Lady, 'tis true I have no pictured volume with me, but there is an old legend which now rests upon my memory, which it might pleasure thee to hear.” “Well said, my monkish romancer!” laughed the Countess, as she yet stood in front of the Neophyte. “This night shall be a night of joy with me—the Lord Urban Di Capello holds high festival on the waters of the Arno, by moonlight. This thou knowest, is our bridal eve. Thy merry story, be it of love, of chivalry, or war, will fit my mind for the gaiety of the carnival night. Adrian, draw thy seat near this couch, and I will listen to thy legend.” “I dream!” whispered Adrian, as he drew his seat near the velvet couch, on which half seated and half reclined the Countess. “'Tis a mockery of fancy which some wanton fiend has conjured up, to cheat my soul with a vision of bliss that may never know reality.” There was a pause of a moment, and then mastering the strange tumult that was gathering round his heart and brain, the Neophyte began his legend. THE STORY OF THE NEOPHYTE. “Ladye Rose, 'twas on a night soft and balmy as the night we now behold, that the rising moon, gleaming over the mountains and the streams of a landscape fair and lovely as the view that opens before our vision, shone light and silvery through the columns of a palace hall, where sat a youth and a maiden, awed by the silence of the twilight hour. “'Twas a lovely place, that palace bower—with its curiously carved columns, its pictured ceiling, its flowers of balm hanging in festoons along the balcony on which it opened; it was a lovely place, and the silent air, and the rising moon, made it a scene for thought, a home for melancholy musing. “The maiden was fair, and young, and beautiful. O, how beautiful! A thing of joy, with a full, dark eye, that flashed with the eloquent thoughts that hope and youth alone can speak—a voice whose whisper was music, whose laugh was harmony—a smile that came thrilling to the heart, like the smile of an angel face seen in a midsummer dream. “Oh! she was beautiful! with her form of maidenly proportions clad in the vestments of rank and power, her neck swan-like in form, with its alabaster whiteness flushed by the warm blood of youth, and around her face of beauty hung drooping tresses of midnight hair, through which the moonbeams played, while her countenance was half averted in dreaming thought, and her bosom throbbing with the pulsations of a strange emotion. “And there she sat, gazing silently upon the moonlit landscape, while he who sat by her side had but one look, one voice, one soul—and all were hers!” The voice of the Neophyte was warm and impassioned. The Lady Rose leaned forward with interest and attention. For a moment the distinction between the proud ladye and the nameless student seemed cast aside, if not forgotten. “And he who sat beside the maiden,” whispered the Lady Rose, “who was he, and how looked he? Was he young, gallant, and handsome?” “Young he was, fair Ladye Rose, but neither gallant nor handsome. There was a ban upon his soul, and a curse upon his fate. The joys of others were not his joys—their fears not his fears—their hopes were unknown to him. His way of life had lain along a desert strown with ashes, the embers of his blasted hopes, and the sky above him was dark, and the earth beneath him lay dead, yielding nor flower of joy, nor leaf of consolation, nor fruit of gallant purpose or high-wrought ambition. “And as he sat in that silent hall, his soul was possessed by one thought, and for that thought he had denied his God, bartered his soul, and taken to his heart an agony that gnawed like the eternal fire —and that thought he dared not breathe to the maiden's ear. That thought was—his love for her!” “Fool that he was!” absently murmured the Ladye Rose, as she gazed on the bronzed face and the flashing eyes of the Neophyte. “Dared not tell her of his love? Coward in heart—knew he not that 'tis the bold heart ever wins the fair face? Why seized he not her hand? Why knelt he not at her feet? Why to her own ear did he not speak the words of his love?” The legend of the Neophyte had aroused the better feelings of the maiden's heart, her bosom throbbed, and her eye flashed, her voice was deep-toned with sympathy; and, with glowing cheek and parted lip, she awaited the answer of the student. “Ladye Rose—in one word thou hast my answer. He was poor and nameless—she rich and proud! Life opened to her eye a path winding in sunlight. He was cut off from his kind by an irrevocable ban. Life to him was—despair. Death alone was hope!” “Poor—nameless? An irrevocable ban? Thou speakest mysteries! Was he poor? What knoweth Love of poverty or wealth? A ban upon his fate? Dark must be the curse, dark the ban, that Love may not break and dispel. How name ye this lover and his love? Said'st thou he was a warrior?” “Ladye!” shrieked the Neophyte, starting to his feet, “he was no warrior! He was—a monk! His name was Adrian, and,” he sank kneeling at her feet, “and he loved Rose, the Flower of Ellarini!” He seized her hand—he pressed it to his lips! His eyes gleamed passion, and his breath came fast and hurried in convulsive gasps. There was a death-like pause of a single instant —a pause of speechless astonishment on the part the Ladye Rose—of speechless passion on the part of the monk Adrian. “Ha—ha—ha!” laughed the maiden, starting to her feet, “ha—ha—ha—ha! This is a passing merry jest! 'Twill do to tell to my Lord Urban Di Capello, at the festival to night! `How the monk loved the maiden!' Ha—ha—ha! What! ave I aroused a passion in the bosom of young anctity? Ha—ha—ha! By my fay, a passing merry jest! I'd even tell it to my lord, were't not for the thought that thy priestly robes would prove a sorry defence against the thrust of his sword! `How the monk loved the maiden!' Ha—ha—ha!” Adrian arose slowly upon his feet. He leaned against a vine-garlanded column. He covered his face in the folds of his dark robe. The maiden sprang between the columns of the bower-hall, along to the balcony, and her voice, with its musical laughter, again broke upon the air. “By my fay, a gallant sight! See—see! the carnival procession winds around the brow of yon hill on the farther side of the silvery Arno! A gallant sight!—there are maskers and mimes quaintly attired—strains of festival music come floating along the silent air, and all Florence is alive for the river-feast to-night! How gallantly the warriors guide their prancing steeds along the hill! Plumes gleam in the moonlight, and banners wave! A gallant sight! And there is my Lord Urban Di Capello—young and bold—on his dark black steed! His robes glitter with jewels—the plume is on his brow, and the sword is by his side! I hear his manly laugh and his bold voice! A gallant cavalier as ever rode to battle, or danced with fair ladye! Ha—ha—ha! I must e'en tell him the merry legend, `How the monk loved the maiden!' Ha—ha—ha!” And leaning over the balcony, her robes flung back, and her dark hair swept aside from her brow, the fair Ladye Rose, the Flower of Ellarini, clapped her delicate hands with joy and delight. Adrian, the Neophyte, threw back the folds of his robe, and the moonbeams fell upon a face from which all color of life had fled. “Would I might weep!” he murmured. “Would I could weep! There is fire in my brain, and mine eye-balls are turned to things of living flame! The fiend hath frozen the blood around my heart! Oh, that I might weep a single tear! Ah—ha! I see it all! I am in the regions of the lost—tears are unknown here—tears are foes to despair— 'twere not well for the Lost to weep, else might they regain their native heaven! “And I am lost, then! Once I had a dream of love and beauty—and ere that, a dream of a God and a heaven crossed my soul! But all are gone, now! Shapes of terror are around me, and forms of death gibber and laugh in my face! They think to fright me! They wot not that I love them now, for—for,” his voice sank to a whisper, like the voice of a skeleton, could it speak, “for I am an evil spirit, now—and I love these forms of horror —I woo them! Ha—ha—ha! I am a demon, now!” No hollow laugh of supernatural omen broke the silence of the air, but a low moaning sound was heard directly over the head of the Neophyte. It was the spirit that ruled the destiny of Adrian, the Neophyte, groaning as he looked upon the ruin he had wrought. Despair had bidden farewell to Hope—and the end drew nigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOURTH PICTURE. A solitary figure, in a lonely cathedral aisle. The blaze of sunbeams is around him, and his brow is calm with— Religion? Love? I trow not. The light upon his brow is the enthusiasm of Death. THE JOY OF THE SUNSHINE. “'Tis the sweet hour of morning man voice, save mine, disturbs the siience of the cathedral, yet 'tis all alive with life and joy! “The light of the sunbeams streaming through the stained panes of the lofty windows, and flinging images of garish splendor along the aisles, and over the altars of this solemn temple—the joy of the sunshine dancing amid the sculptured flowers of the lofty columns, and gleaming gaily and merrily from the Mosaic pavement to the fretted roof, while the massive shadows of altar and column, flung heavily along the tessellated stone, served only to render the glow of the morning sun more bright and glaring. “Silence rests upon the place and hour—yet how soon will the place and hour be noisy with the hum of human voices! 'Tis the last day of the carnival, and while mirth and riot mingle their voices in the streets without, a solemn scene shall render even yet more holy the hallowed silence of God's own temple. “One month since, by yonder postern door, I gave my son Adrian his first view of the world— he went forth on his strange pilgrimage. Last night he returned from his scene of trial. No word, save the word of blessing, passed from me ere he sought his cell, yet methought trouble was written upon his young brow. May the Holy One nerve him for his hour of trial!” And devoutly crossing himself, the aged Abbot glanced around the silent aisles of the cathedral. He stood in the centre of the chapel, with the light from the dome far above gilding his grey hairs, and brightening the glow of the cross reposing amid the folds of his sacerdotal robes. In the full blaze of the morning sun, in the eastern nave of the cathedral, in front of the high altar of the temple, arose a stage, covered with folds of snow-white velvet, gay with flowers of gold, and drooping in sweeping circles down to the marble floor. From the centre of this stage arose an altar of silver, gaudy with mouldings and ornaments, bearing a cross of gold on its surface, intermingled with a simple wreath of flowers—the rose entwined with the laurel. The flower of Ellarini mingling its perfume with the unfading glory of Capello. At the farther end of the cathedral, in the centre of its western nave, in front of a high altar surmounted by a grisly skeleton, side by side with a massive cross, arose another stage, covered with folds of solemn black. An altar of iron arose from the darkness of this stage, with a death's-head grinning beside a rugged cross, formed of like metal with the altar. It arose like a shadow of gloom, that altar of black, confronting the altar of white, at the farther end of the church, with its solid and massive form of dread, like death frowning in the face of life, and the altar of white, with its flowers of gold, seemed laughing to scorn the face of death. A merry chime of bells came floating along the silent air. “The merry marriage bells!” exclaimed the Abbot. “They hail the union of the laurel of Capello with the rose of Ellarini!” The solemn toll of the death-bell burst like a thunder-clap over the cathedral. “Toll—toll—toll! 'Tis the knell which consigns the youth Adrian to the solitude of the living-death!” LIFE AND DEATH. And as the chime of life and the knell of death mingled their strange and contrasted sounds, the wide doors of the northern part of the cathedral were flung suddenly open, and a band of rosy-cheeked children came thronging into the temple, walking two by two, and scattering rose-buds and leaves of laurel by the way. And then came a fair maiden, clad in robes of snow-white, side by side with a gallant cavalier, all gorgeous in the blaze of golden attire, with a sword by his side, and a snow-white plume drooping over his youthful brow. As the eye of the Abbot rested upon the youthful pair slowly approaching the centre of the temple, where he stood, he also beheld, winding through the opened door, the gay throng of beauteous maidens and gallant cavaliers, each lip with its smile, and each eye with its flash of joy, while the air echoed with the music of the marriage lay. As the merry strain came pealing gaily along the cathedral, the massive doors opening to the south, were opened wide, and a hymn for the dead, chaunted by manly voices, rose solemnly upon the air, and mingled with the marriage song. Winding from the shadow of the southern door, and walking two by two, a band of dark-robed monks raised the death song, and as they sung, they slowly approached the centre of the cathedral, where the Abbot stood gazing at this singular scene of life and death. Amid the band of monks, attired in a tunic of white, over which, sweeping to the floor, descended the folds of a robe of black velvet, there walked, with slow and measured step, a youth in the flush of early manhood, yet with a face pale as death, shaded by long locks of rich brown hair, that fell along his shoulders in massive curls. His hands were folded fixedly upon his breast, and his dark grey eyes gleamed forward in one unvarying, unchanging glance. No smile was on his lip, no frown was on his brow. All calm, all composed, all silent and still. “How calm, and yet how pale he looks!” murmured the Abbot, as the two processions, with their songs of life and death intermingling, approached the column. “Onward he stalks, slow and solemn in pace. His face is calm—his eye is clear and steady in its glance, and yet there is something o omen in that even gait, that unalterable look, that freezing eye!” As he spoke, the procession of life and the procession of death, on the point of turning toward their separate altars, met beneath the light of the magnificent dome, and the eye of the Abbot rested upon the forms of beauteous maidens, brilliant with jewels, and gallant cavaliers, with their plumes of white waving in the air with each motion of the figure, or floating aside with each bend of the head. And in their midst, side by side with his bride, Lord Urban Di Capello tripped gaily onward, the smile on his passionless lip, the vacant glance in his eye, and the ready compliment, or skilfully-prepared flattery, ever on his tongue. The Lady Rose of Ellarini! How queenly was her air, how magnificent her step, how proud the inclination of her swan-like neck, as, moving onward in her robes of white, she glanced around with a flashing eye and a peerless look, while she surveyed the scene, where every eye, and glance, and tone, and voice, had but one object of attention, and that object her own fair faee and lovely form. Adrian the Neophyte stood in the full light of the dome; and as the sunbeams fell brightly over his erect form, his folded arms, his mingled robes of white and black, the gallants and damozels of the marriage procession started back with a sudden thrill of fear, and each gazer noted, that there was a strange expression resting upon his massive brow, a strange compression of his lips, and a strange and unknown steadiness in the glance of his eye. The fair bride looked upon him, but his glance met not the glance of her eye, and for a moment the proud and peerless Lady Rose, the Flower of Ellarini, with all her fame and beauty, with her bridal robes, and her future of hope, envied the poor and nameless monk with his robes of sacrifice and his doom of eternal solitude. Why should she envy him—the nameless Neophyte? She knew not; Yet a thought flashed over her proud heart that she might have acted a nobler part, than by toying and trifling with the soul of the Enthusiast as though it were a thing of no value. Yet she was a gay thing and a fair, and her heart was the heart of a woman of the world. “Urban Di Capello—Rose of Ellarini!” the voice of the Abbot was heard above the song of life and the hymn of death. “The blessing of heaven be upon ye, as ye pass onward through the gates of Youth into the future of Happiness and Hope!” And as he spoke the bridal procession wound on its way to the altar of white. “Adrian, my son and brother! God be with thee in thy solitude, and thy soul will have room for never a care of earth, never a pang of her woes, her wrongs, and her sorrows! The blessing of Heaven be upon thee, as thou passeth through the gate of Eternal Solitude into the presence of God! And the procession of dark robed monks wended heir way toward the altar of black, and the hymn of life and the hymn of death, broke louder and yet louder upon the air, while high over all the marriage chime and the death-knell mingled their notes of bliss and woe, with a combination of discord and harmony, that seemed like a mockery of the petty joys and petty sorrows that make up the sum of human life. Adrian the Neophyte stood upon the Altar of Black. THE LIVING DEATH. On either side, and around the foot of the altar, were grouped circling bands of dark-robed priests; beyond were the temple aisles, thronged by laughing groups of carnival revellers, in their fantastic costumes, and garish attire, and at the further nave of the church, the morning sunlight fell warmly and brightly over the altar of white with the marriage procession winding up its flower-strewn steps, in bright and magnificent array, their jewelled attire glittering in the light, and their happy faces glowing with the smiles of vacant joy. “It is past—thy month of trial!” said the venerable Abbot, laying his withered hands upon the brown locks of the neophyte. “And now take one long and earnest gaze around thee, at the gay world which thou art about to leave forever! Disease has not weakened thy young limbs, nor sorrow dimmed thine eye, and yet in the full glow of youth and health, thou passeth from this gay scene, to the shadows of Eternal Solitude! Canst thou resign the world without a sigh?” “I can!” The Neophyte turned his face to the Altar of Black, with its iron cross and its grinning skull. “And dost thou here in the presence of the gay and glittering world, in the name of God, in the name of his blessed Son, in the name of the Awful Spirit, before the Virgin ever worthy of adoration and in presence of the Saints, vow a solemn vow by the safety of thine eternal soul, to set thyself apart from the world, apart from the faces of men, apart from human hope and human consolation, now and forevermore! Dost thou take this solemn and irrevocable vow?” “I do!” The Neophyte placed his hand upon the cross and the skull. “Adrian, Sacred and Set-apart, turn thee and look upon the world for the last time!” Adrian turned and looked. His glance was fixed and unwavering, and yet he beheld not the throng of dark robed monks clustering around the altar, he saw not the sea of upturned faces, he heard not their voices, he knew not of their presence in the cathedral aisles. THE DOOM OF THE STUDENT AND THE LADYE. He looked far, far beyond, and there, gleaming in the sunlight, he beheld the altar of white, the bridegroom and the bride. One long glance he cast over the sea of faces, and then a shout of alarm, a mingled shout and yell ran along the cathedral, and the altar of black was vacant, while through the affrighted multitude with, steps that knew no obstacle or hinderance, rushed a figure in mingled robes of white and black, his eye fixed upon the distant altar, his arms outspread and a long and slender dagger gleaming in his clenched right hand. Onward, still onward, ere the venerable Abbot had time to glance around him, ere the dark robed monks knew that the Altar of Black was vacant, onward and onward, fearlessly breaking his way through the bands of maskers and revellers, onward toward the bridal altar, with the speed of wind rushed Adrian the Neophyte. A pause of a moment! Another yell of horror shrieks along the aisles of the cathedral! The dark figure has reached the bridal altar—one bound and he springs upward, and stands erect upon the velvet carpeting of the stage, the gleaming knife raised on high, the arm nerved and the death certain, while the astonished priests, the thunder-striken bridegroom, and the bridal guests recoil with the utter helplessness of a fearful surprise. He stands upon the altar, his eyes glaring, and the knife raised! One blow, and the Rose of Ellarini will fall a bleeding corse upon the snow white velvet of the bridal altar—no human arm may save her now— the madman may call one single moment his own —that moment is small, yet to him, to Adrian the neophyte 'tis worth an age—it will serve for the accomplishment of his purpose! “Nay, start not, fair maiden, nor turn pale!” These were the words that fell shrieking from his lips. “Recoil not with horror, nor avert thine eyes with fear! Fair thou art and beautiful, thy full dark eyes were but made to speak passion, thy ruby lips to murmur tones of love! And for thee have I denied my God, for thee have I bartered my soul, for thee have I kindled the flames of the eternal fire within this bosom, that knew no care till mine eyes looked upon thy face of beauty and thy form of grace! “And these are the last words of Adrian the Neophyte to the proud and peerless beauty—Rose of Ellarini! “If ever thou knowest a joy, dear unto thee, as hath been the thought of God to me, then may that joy be torn from thee as thou hast torn the thought of God from my soul! “Mayst thou taste the cup of human bliss, nor taste alone, but drain to the dregs—mayst thou revel in hollow pleasure and souless gaiety, until it becometh a part of thy nature, and then when the faces thou lovest to look upon wither, when the friends of thy heart are faithless, when the lips thou wert wont to kiss stale on thy taste, then when life has wasted all her pleasures at thy feet, mayst thou then know, not Despair, nor Woe, nor Death—but Life! And then as the curse of curses —the curse of SATIETY is gathering over thy heart, then remember that for thee, Adrian the Neophyte denied his God and bartered his soul!” With eye flashing, with hair thrown back from his brow, in a tone of fear and horror, the Neophyte uttered the words, which thrilled the spectators with helpless terror, while the dagger gleamed in his clenched hand. He advanced toward the maiden—he gazed upon her fair face for a moment—he flung the dagger to the floor. “The curse of Satiety!” he murmured, looking her fully in the face, and then folding his arms across his breast, he stepped backward, and cast a look to heaven! In a moment a heavy body fell to the floor, and the bystanders gazed upon the shapeless corse of Adrian the Neophyte, the arms outstretched, the limbs contorted, and a thin stream of blood flowing from the compressed lips. “He lieth low, a wreck of all that is noble or good!” exclaimed the venerable Abbot, as bursting through the affrighted throng he surveyed the corse. “He lieth low, a shapeless corse, and yet fair maiden 'tis for thee that we should weep—not for him!— He hath said the curse, and it is upon thee—the curse of a broken heart! Behold how his blood streams along the white robes of the altar!” And there, while the bystanders recoiled with horror at this strange and spectral scene, while the Lord Urban Di Capello hid his face in his robe, and the maiden Rose of Ellarini stood gazing vacantly at the corse, while the head of the Abbot was drooped on his breast, and from aisle to aisle of the cathedral ran the shriek and the cry and the groan, there, above shout and cry and groan, was heard the sound of unreal laughter, far above in the air, and a voice unseen and unknown whispered the words— “Youth—and Hope—and Love! Brave things are they all! Ha—Ha—Ha—Behold Adrian the Neophyte!”</field>
