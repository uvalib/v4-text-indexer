      <field name="fulltext">Southern District of New-York, ss. BE IT REMEMBERED, That on the 9th day of June, A. D. 1827, in the 51st year of the Independence of the United States of America, Charles S. Francis, of the said District, hath deposited in this office the title of a Book, the right whereof he claims as Proprietor, in the words following, to wit: “The Buccaneers; a Romance of our own Country, in its ancient day, illustrated with divers marvellous histories, and antique and facetious episodes; gathered from the most authentic chronicles and affirmed records extant from the settlement of the Nieuw Nederlandts, until the times of the famous Richard Kid, carefully collated from the laborious researches, and minute investigations of that excellent antiquary and sublime philosopher, yclept Terentius Phlogobombos. There are land rats, and water rats— There are land thieves, and water thieves. Shakspeare.” In conformity to the Act of Congress of the United States, entitled “An Act for the encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the time therein mentioned.” And also to an Act, entitled “An Act supplementary to an Act, entitled an Act for the encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times therein mentioned, and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.” FREDERICK I. BETTS, Clerk of the Southern District of New-York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A SHORT PROEM; THAT CONCERNETH THE INDITER WHEREIN IS CONTAINED AN EXTRAORDINARY VISION THAT BECAME MANIFEST UNTO HIM: AND ALSO, HOW THEREBY HE BECAME POSSESSED OF THE WORK THAT ADJOINS. “For my own part, being hindered partly by the charge, partly by impatience, and partly by the rumours of the vulgar, I was not willing to make experiment of all things which may easily be tried by others; but have resolved to express those things in obscure and difficult terms, which I judge requisite to the conservation of health, lest they should fall into the hands of the unfaithful.” —Friar Bacon. “To use no circumstance at all before one comes to the matter, is blunt,” says the great Baron of Verulam, and in setting forth in this work, I mean, gentle reader, to avail myself of this advice; not but what we have heretofore had acquaintance, nor that I intend to make a long and lame excuse for errors in the composition of these pages—for those, as will be perceived from the incident detailed in this proem, I am not accountable; but that sufficient precaution may be given to the peruser that he allow not his imagination too much latitude. I am aware that many pages will be construed into direct satire, and with their usual forwardness and conscientious readiness of opinion, the extant knaves and blockheads of the day will be for taking the application to themselves, thereby making me the avowed enemy of all of their class. Now as I am but young, and have therefore not a right to make foes, it would be impolitic in me, who have much to look forward for, to turn against me the most respected, influential, and envied portion of the community;—for although an author is lauded as ingenious when he slanders the defenceless, the inoffensive, and the nobodies of society—or when he confines his pen to base calumnies on the poor, the modest, and the retiring citizen, he is supported with the venomous spirit of party; and the higher order, in unison with the multitude, lavish applause, and heartily shake their sides in pleasure at the most contemptible and villanous scandal:—yet if he be indiscreet,—and the satirist too often warmed by his subject, and a just indignation against vice, hath a wonderous propensity to rashness, and oversteps the bounds of policy and caution by taking what hath been styled impertinent and libellous freedoms with men of consequence, or at least the temporary wielders of power, no matter how corrupt, base, venal and deserving of reproach, he soon finds to his cost that he hath unawares ventured on dangerous ground, where neither the justice of his cause, the purity of his intent, or the criminality of his opponents avail him against the machinations of his enemies: he is truly condemned without hearing—dragged to punishment without a trial, or at least a mere mockery of one—in short, like the great English martyr of liberty, Algernon Sidney, who perished for writings found in his cabinet, he is led to the block, with no chance of life from the infamous malignity of the most abandoned and profligate; for however these latter may enjoy the tortures of others, and sneer at the defamed victim of political or private persecution, they soon discover in the altered case a thousand monstrous enormities, and that to be exposed and laughed at themselves, is a direct breach of the peace, and they adopt every means, no matter how foul, to chastise and silence the traducer; for it is beyond doubt that the station, the wealth, and disposition of the vicious characters he assails, more than the truth of his accusations, test the event of the successful reception of the person who aims at the destruction of public immorality. Convinced of this in every instance, and having likewise learnt by a close observation of passing events, that the truth of the position I have set forth is more peculiarly apparent in unstable governments, which are swayed by fickle and alternate factions, whereby the power and authority is to-day delegated in one hand, and to-morrow in another; for it is in such jarring and conflicting struggles for empire that arise from such a state of things, that the knave and the rogue have the best opportunity to flourish, as they will boil up like scum upon the surface of affairs—for should they luckily adopt the strongest side, which by a careful change of opinion at the right period they always can steer to in time, and for which such men are ever on the watch—no matter of how deep a die the crimes they may have committed—no matter whether they be the barefaced and abandoned swindlers who have stripped the orphan and the widow of their scanty pittance—no matter whether their names have heretofore been an infamy and blot on society which 1* hath allowed them to walk abroad in the day, they are ushered triumphantly into power, and it is a crime to mention their villanies; unfortunate indeed hath it become, and dangerous to every right of man, where there is no firm head or fount of sovereignty to which those who are trampled on and oppressed for their weakness may appeal for mercy and redress from the bitter persecutions of petty and subordinate tyrants—where the stream of justice is always contaminated and divided, and instead of pouring forth broad, rapid, and powerful, like the rushing cataract of the mountains, it trickles away into a thousand ruts and gullies until it is clogged, choaked, and finally lost amid the mud, sand, and pebbles with which it hath been mingled—where neither a strict impartiality or even a common rectitude of feeling hath influence on the mind of constituted authority— where he that mounts the seat of judgment hath no will of his own, but like the sere and russet-coloured leaf of autumn, the last of its race, that dangles on the topmost branch, is moved by every breeze that breathes upon him.—In such states, (and the like we have seen) it is reduced beyond the possibility of doubt, that the feeble hath not the shadow of chance against might, and the maxim of the politician in all cases prevails—the judgment must not be made according to the law, but to the man:—and how can it be otherwise, when that time which should be given to high and important duties, is spent in forming selfish and personal plans of future aggrandizement—when the brief and precarious enjoyment of office must for its own safety be wasted in rewarding hungry partisans, without regard to qualifications or character—when the prerogatives of station are merely used for intrigue, personal motives, or to crush an adversary? It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that while such laxity of principles and virtue are freely countenanced and fostered —that when the very administration of justice hath become tainted and rotten to the source—when the judge will sit cheek by jowl with the very parties whose case he is to decide upon, and in secret and apart listen to their separate arguments, that I should seek, and with reason, that no motive of mine should be misconstrued, and that no man may take up this book with an idea that as he looks in a mirror he will behold his own visage in particular. I hasten to assure all that from the extraordinary manner in which the manuscript came into my possession, there can be no hesitation in saying that however strongly marked some passages may appear, yet the intention hath been to expose the general vices and follies of the time, and particularly to avoid virulence; but if any ass should be peculiarly obstinate in applying certain remarks to himself, I am very willing he shall enjoy his innocent pleasure. I was seated one beautiful and radiant afternoon, in thought at my window, which looked out on a cluster of those lovely little spots of cultivation, that in the centre of the squares, like Edens, surrounded by lofty walls, refresh and delight the sight, tired with the noise, bustle, and dust of the crowded and busy streets. In such a seclusion one seems retired from the world, whose afar off hurricane scarce disturbs the solitary quietude of meditation. The sun was near his setting, and the whole wide west was lighted up with a thousand gorgeous colours, which seemed like banners floating amid the drapery of a conqueror's pavilion to which he was in triumph retiring; lovely rays of crimson and scarlet fell on the neighbouring windows, over which often hung a gay cloud of blushing vines, the fragrant jessamine, and purple honeysuckle, from whose velvet blossoms a living sweetness floated to the sense; the summer birds swam by in a stream of melody, and the breath of a hundred shrubs filled the air with odours far more pleasant than the soft wind of the Indian isles that fans the lips of the mariner, rich and loaded with spicy and citron perfumes. But the subject that employed my mind did not harmonise with the delicious repose of nature that lay before me. I was amid the very music of the flowers, whose silken cups waved redolent with life before the faint whisper of some straggling zephyr; yet I marked not their beauty. Busied and agitated in reflection, my eye turned with vacant gaze upon the glories of the sun, yet heeded little their splendours:— “How strange is man,” I exclaimed in the course of my reverie; “he seems truly formed to be his own bane; with sorrow in his bosom he will make a desert of the brightest paradise, scattering the bitter feelings of his soul, like frost upon the earth at night—a chilling, destroying, blighting, and untimely frost; and yet inconsistent with its horrors, like an angel to the sick, joy, yea happiness will come, and he will feel its influence in the wide and desolate wilds of Asia, or on the cold and rugged floor of the dank prison-house. Yet it is apparent that evil doth almost eternally spread a shadow over the populous events of life, and that however fair our prospect of pleasure, we are deceived;—though our cup may be filled as with honey, poison, deadly and venomous rankles on the brim;—thorns sharp and piercing as the poisoned darts of the Saracen enthusiast, mingle with the flowers which we grasp; all which hath the semblance of beauty is as the apple of gold with the heart of ashes:—man is truly born to adverse fortune—to be the very curse of his own life—a mote, a creation fashioned for the amusement of some greater being, who gathers enjoyment from the troubles and adversity which he has caused—the groans and misery which his dwarfs and puppets draw from each other: For man is the enemy of man; his hatred to his brothers of clay is sucked in, as it were, from the snowy fountains of his mother's breast, the milk he imbibes is gall that circulates in the very air he breathes, and like a curse doth the foulest passions cling to his existence;— nor like the venomous garment of Hercules, will they leave him with life. Look around! are not our fellow-creatures tormented one by another in endless, countless varieties of pain? If pestilence is in the city, will the rich man open his overstocked stores to the starving populace? If the most sacred treaty can be violated with personal safety, will the bondsman keep it? If gain will arise, will not those of the same blood compass the death of each other? For a rood of land are not cities sacked and levelled to the ground, so that the ploughshare might pass above? Are not the fields of the husbandman watered with his own blood? and the reaper gathers his grain, which hath been manured by the gore of armies. Extirpation, from plague, famine, murder, leprosy, and a thousand torments and diseases, are our doom; nor will there one step aside in his path, though by such he might succour and save from these his own kindred: What myriads of bones whiten and bleach in the sun of Palestine and Italy! the Infidel, the Pagan, the Moslem, the Nazarene and the Jew—who whilst living made it the business of life to destroy each other, and though mingled in one common dust, that their fiendish lot may be sustained, they have sowed the earth with dragons' teeth in their descendants. Who will contend that life is not an evil gift—a foul image with a veil of loveliness—a diadem of adders and of nettles hid by vine leaves—an iceberg of death, glowing beneath the variegated hues of sky, beautiful as a palace of spirits to the sight, but destroying if approached;—Or if otherwise, why are we from infancy filled and agitated with desires, to dream of the bare possibility of which were madness?—Why doth the fulfilment of our wishes lead us oftentimes headlong into ruin?—why are our days wearied out in strife, revenge, and cruelty?—why doth the wing of ingratitude take away the light of heaven from us?—the hands of those who have fattened on our bounties thrust us to night, piercing our hearts with the barbed tongues of serpents—formless as the undistinguishable air, yet deadly as the spear broken in the heart, blow on every gale the slanderous whispers of calumny:—and doth not the eye of envy glare out upon our every action, like the fierce glance of the sun from beneath a thunder cloud, seeming the ireful and death-boding gaze of a warrior on his advancing foeman?—What do we not suffer from thirst, hunger, and want?—Every movement we make, we are tempted to our destruction, as though standing on the brink of some mighty precipice;—for what a receptacle, a store-house of horrible desires, and desolating, mighty, and overwhelming passions is this high prized lump of clay—this human body—this superior brute of earth; ambition, pride, lust, remorse and grief,—all are concentrated in one little mass, one circle of mortality; and yet withal what a frail, weak casket is it that holds all these—a thing fragile as the fallen leaf or the icicle on a garden wall—as soon, as sudden as the flashing of a summer light it will perish—a very particle of dust will end the workings of the wonderful mechanism—and the restless, motionless frame will lie still and powerless at a moment— hope, despair, joy and might at once are at an end,—though in the midst of wo—though bright visions illuminate the airy future—all is dissipated as by a word;—the statesman's busy brain—the lover's anguish—the poor man's tortures—the lazar's pain—the losel's sloth, are finished—the white death, the spectre king, the insatiable rioter of the grave hath been with them, and the farce is over. What avail the riches of the much vaunted mind, the pomp of pride, the plenitude of wealth, and the solitary luxuries of genius? Look at yon sorry elf; behold him toil, and by the dim and languid taper pass the night; see he hath worn the day in his unwearied labour, even until like an adder disease hath crept into his bones: what is his reward? he has gathered the gold of science, but it is as dirt; he has climbed the rugged and precipitous hill of fame, but his travail hath been like the punishment of the son of Æolus,[1] [1] Sisyphus. to see his work was in vain. And mark you purse proud follower of traffic; what comes of his dishonesty—his overreaching, or his selfish cunning—his ingots of gold—his silken bales—his rich cargoes and galliots? they are but a mere mockery, a dream; with all his accumulations he is made a bankrupt in a moment. Of what use hath been those heaped up volumes of knowledge—those mountains of inestimable thoughts, which days, years, an existence hath been wasted in collecting? have they bettered the condition of man one jot? is not life a child's play, a pantomime of smiles and weeping, a harlequinade of folly and unhappiness still? for what hath been the learning of a Bacon, the cringing and slavish couplets of a Waller, the fire of a Spenser, the philosophy of a Locke, the wild theories of a Newton and a Fontenelle, the wit of a Boileau, or the sweet fancy of a Sidney? What have they taught us? are we not the same miserable, wretched atoms that we were before they were heard of?—and with all their qualifications, what were they, and what are they now? —the wretches and the nothings that all men are and must become.” As my lips embodied these ideas, I felt that the curse of life was far beyond the lines of description; it was only to be felt—a biting, withering gift—the aceldama[2] [2] Rather Chakeldam, a portion of blood, vid. Lingua Sacra. A name also applied to the field wherein strangers were buried. of the Hebrew—an inheritance of blood and crime: and as my thoughts that had burst into voice were hushed; wild, scattered, yet vivid imagery seemed trooping through my brain, like the sickly and terrible phantoms that rattle past through the midnight and distempered dreams of a dying man. My lips moved, but there came but broken sounds—while with a fixed attention, my very eye-balls distended as it were to suck in the boundless phantasy which floated by like the eaglet on the wings of the storm:—first I could mark the scaffolds that were dripping with gore as though in wine—the pure blood of the innocent was as a fountain, but that of guilt was scarce seen; then came those mockeries of solemnity, the vain judgment seats of mortality, where the criminal sits to judge the criminal—where the only difference between the thief and the sentencer is his garb—where the homicide hath often less to account for than he who rules the trial!—then came the elder brother, his limbs blasted by the potions of his ambitious younger—but there were whole armies of the lame, the blind, the diseased and the mutilated, the offals of the dungeon, the lazaret, and the brothel; victims of religion, bigotry, cruelty, and madness, their misery the infliction of daily sport! There was the stranded wreck of a brutal and momentary enjoyment— her form lean, thin, and wan—her features haggard and care worn, nauseous and distorted with sickness—her love formed lips withered —and her arms, once so round and fair, wrinkled and faded that you might have counted every sunken vein—while her eye shot forth the red wild glare of insanity:—hard by the palace porch of her proud betrayer who revels in wealth, she hath sat her down for shelter from the night dew—she hath wrapped her tattered cloak about the feverish body of her fatherless, her disowned and famine stricken babe—its hollow cheek, its lustreless sight, its heavy sighs, its houseless state, exposed foodless to the pitiless blast, have conquered her last pride—she hath begged at the gate of her destroyer for a bit of bread, but his liveried lacquies and his scoffing serfs with bitter gibes have thrust her from the threshold:—yet she hath made a double grave upon its lowest step, her infant's and her own. Now came a blast as if the summoner was nigh—the braggart flourish of the trump and clarion waken with their war cry yon mighty mass—it is a city fast bound in sleep and night, defenceless and open to the ruthless foe—the alarm bell tolls its dreadful peal —from out their doors the half-garbed citizens rush like the sheeted dead from their startled graves—the wild shout—the wailing and weeping cry of woman—the falling of burning rafters and cinders —the shrieks of the dying—all mingle in one horrid medley; the blood of childhood is not spared in the slaughter, the lintels and the doorways serve to dash out the brains of the screaming and helpless babe—will not the sacred nuptial couch save you youthful bride from ravishment? will not the white arms of the maiden shield the bosom of her betrothed? will not the grey hairs of the patriarch serve to protect him from the sword? No! the aged father of threescore, the new-born infant, the wedded wife, the warrior and his promised love, who blushes as she names the hour of marriage, lie unregarded in a heap of bloody and putrid corruption; while the vulture feeds amid the ruins, and the wolf, fattened and tired of his banquet, couches to rest in the carrion-strewed streets—Yet yon traitor, decked in the spoils of triumph, snatched from the mouldering ashes of the place of his birth which he had betrayed, is pampered with honours in the gorgeous pageant of the conqueror. I sickened, and closed my sight, straining to shut out the visionary horrors. I leaned my head on my hand and looked forth—all things were bright, blithe, and blooming—the spirits of youth, joy, and enjoyment were abroad, enriching earth with their most pleasant smiles—the butterflies fanning the air with their gold dropped wings, like brilliant and lovely eyes of the summer, sporting in gladness, sailed from bud to bud—the soft and beautiful blossoms of the lily, waving in maiden loveliness, looked like floating cups of down; in troth, dame Nature had donned her holiday kirtle, and seemed like some sweet girl smiling amid her fears, as she waited the wished for one on her bridal morn and in her bridal drapery— the very air that wantoned as it stirred the glittering trees, was genial as the breath of life, and the timorous leaves of the aspen lapped the warm kiss of the sunshine with a long unquenching thirst, like the lips of some fresh and happy seraph first drinking in the breath of paradise and delighting in its food. Yet even amid all this, I could not banish from my thought the wild autumn and the sterner winter—when this beauty should become an outcast, and like some shunned and naked leper, or one upon whom the cherem[3] [3] A curse or excommunication, of which, among the Hebrews there were three degrees; the first of which was called Nidui; that is, a separation. The person thus excommunicated, was obliged to stand off from the company the space of four cubits, nor approach any person for thirty days, but was allowed to be present at religious ceremonies, that he might learn penitence; but if he continued hardened in crime, his separation was doubled or trebled, and in some cases, his male children were not admitted to circumcision till he gave proofs of repentance: if he died thus, a stone was hung upon his hearse, to shew that he deserved to be stoned, and therefore nobody mourned for him, or accompanied his corse to the burial; the sepulture of his fathers was closed against him, and his grave was apart by itself. The second kind was the Cherem; this was to publicly denounce, with the addition of the curses of the law; during the ceremony of censure, candles were kept burning, which, at the end of the imprecation, were extinguished, to intimate that the person under the ban was to have no share in the light of the regions of the blessed, (Gan-Heiden.) The third and most formidable, is called Maranatha, which signifies, this is death, to intimate that the condemned person was delivered over to death in the severest sense. The Sadducees had a sort of anathema, which comprehended all three degrees, called Tetragrammaton, which was pronounced in the most solemn manner in the temple, with sounding trumpets, cursing the Samaritans in their music, by the mysterious name of God, by the decalogue, and with the civil ban, charging that no man have intercourse or even eat with them. hath been thrown, she would sit mourning, lonely and forlorn upon the icy and barren hills, a monument of wo and despondency, her crown a diadem of gloomy clouds, as she sorrowed over the work of desolation that had been within her pleasant places. “Ill,” said I, “endeth the race of all created, for the wicked triumph, and plant the thistle and the tare throughout the earth; and it hath come to this, that their power hath given them a right in which they flourish; oh, that I could take the trackless course of a star, that I might seek for peace.” As I said this, my eye rested unconsciously upon the fitful and playful light of a sunbeam that darting through the window before me, died the glittering glass with many fantastic hues and shapes, like those stained in the lights of some ancient chapel, or traced on Indian ivory by the delicate fingers of the Hindoo, when, to my admiration and wonderment, in the very centre of this radiance, surrounded as it were by dazzling rays of brilliancy, there appeared to my sight a form so passing strange yet so transcendently beautiful, as to far outparagon the loveliness of mortality; it seemed a being of a purer essence and a brighter sphere —some fairy creature of the sky, born of the smiling elements and blooming flowers that spring about the gates of paradise. As I gazed upon it at first, I felt as though inclined to doubt the reality of my sense; but the figure, which when it attracted my sight looked indistinct, faint, and pale, like some unfinished outline of beauty, or the evanishing forms that float in the moonlight clouds, grew plain and vivid on my vision; yet still it had a look so fragile and evanescent, that it appeared as though fading in the air of which it seemed a part. There it stood, still and stirless, a creature beyond earth, while myriads of happy things, motes as it were in the sunlight, swam in the opal waves around it, and shook their tiny wings in delight. A soft expressive beam fell from its face, which surpassed the human countenance, and was bright like polished silver—from its brows there floated down in one glittering mass, silken locks of hair—threads of amber spun by mermaids, so gauzy and effulgent, that the very light in which they glittered shone through them as they brightened in its rays—its arms were as snow transparent in its own whiteness, while from either shoulder dropped two filmy pinions studded with starry eyes, delicate as the web of the gossamer, impearled and shivering in the morning dew. At length it spoke, though in an unknown tongue; yet each sound seemed familiar and understood, and my ravished ear drank in the voice of melody sweet as the song of summer birds, and as clear as the blast of a forest horn; thus, methought, ran the tenor of its words:—“Descendant of animated dust, frail and weak formation of earth, in whom are mixed at once the fiery and self-destroying attributes of the fallen angel, but whose composition is mocked by the want of power attendant on mortal birth, cower not at my approach, start not at my visitation, nor plume thee therefrom above thy fellow compounds of clay, those stirring atoms—those busy insects that crawl upon the broad face of creation, swelled and pampered with a conceit Vol. I. 2 of mightiness that scarce belongs to spirits, and is ridiculous from the insignificance of its wearer—creatures who vainly believe the vastitude of world they behold moulded but for their use,— while the very serpent that with his slimy bosom sucks the ground, a thing shunned and trod upon alike by man and beast, coiled in the narrow shadow of his den, holds as fair a capacity of ownership as he that sits within his guarded palace, upon a throne of purple and of pride. Mortal! not to the bidding of the breath of human lip I come, but to that of the heart—for know thy inmost and hidden fancies, and thy secret thoughts, are read by me as palpable as thy most open actions that are written in the volume wherein the doings of creation are recorded: nor think that I am here to gratify the sinful madness of thy wishes—to quench thy thirst for forbidden knowledge—though to me are known all the past events and the future of time—though without form, shape, lineament, or character to the sight, I might have mingled my lessons as it might be from the whisperings of thine own soul, yet I have chosen thus to expose the proud presumption and bold unblushing ignorance of the daring and discontented mind—Children of folly, ye blindly curse the fate whereby you exist, nor seek for the origin of the evil you complain against;—'tis not the fortune that hath made him a being of life— nor the vileness of his fellow that is man's curse—but the lashing and never sleeping scorpions that he bears about in his own restless and aspiring breast: nor is it the gift of his birth—but as from the moment of his existence, his movements are free and uncontrolled, so doth he imbibe the baneful influence of temper and misanthropy, which become in his own hands weapons of destruction against his peace. There are good and bad elements in man, commingled not for war, but for the use of life, and in their direction he hath their entire control; and it is his own rash wilfulness that gives evil the conquest. Like the matin bird, when he first delighted feels the warm sunlight on his downy wing, and springs from his nest in song, doth the child of earth set forward in his pilgrimage of existence; basking in measureless enjoyment, he cares not, even though warned, where he steers his bark, if the sea looks smooth and the sand sparkling; but when the skies lower and the storm launches out from among the gloominess of clouds, he counts not the days of pleasure that he hath passed in careless youth, but reckons them in his despair a nothing to his sorrow—mere rainbow glimpses seen in a stormy heaven,—and yet often it is his own rash temperament that destroys him; he seeks out the vexations of life— when the arrow wounds him he calls not the leech, but madly hastes to tear it forth himself, and skilless leaves the barb within the flesh, and the gash more angered:—is he offended, plots he not revenge double to the injury—is his most senseless plan baffled, are the wildest speculations of his fancy shrunk to the naked and bodiless air of which they were formed—curses he not his creation—looks he not with an eye of hate and a heart of gall upon the prosperous— cries he not out against the unequal decrees of fate?—when he alone hath brought down the wo upon his head—when his own weakness, and not an ungrateful world, hath kindled the fire of misanthropy, that consumes slow but sure, and is his living hell. There have been among ye, men—creatures superior of the species —though the heathen and the infidel,—who have scorned the vain observances, and smiled as one would at the tears of childhood on the cares of mortality, and rose resplendent above the infirmities of earth. But hath there come aught of such examples? have they been studied by the complainer, the bitter sorrower of his birth?— surely it speaks but little of the proud faculties—the godlike inheritance of which men boast and pride themselves, that when they have fed in the luxury of summer, they should not have the fortitude to bear the winter storm.” Not a breath was lost to me, for I was enchained and bound down in tranced emotion, and stirred not; but like one who hears the sudden melody of angels on their night watches, every feeling was rapt, and my very soul seemed to dwell in intense and eager attention upon the words of the shadowy speaker; each moment, as in suspense, I feared lest all should be silent, and the beautiful being, that now was so palpably visible, should disappear and melt away like the dark clouds that float about the white brow of morning; but now there was a pause in the music of its voice, like when the wind god hath passed the Æolian Lyre, and its silken cords have hushed their tremulous notes to silence; and the figure moved not, but stirless as it was, it might have vied with the statue of the Greek, that gave eternity to beauty—my power of speech seemed loosened, and mastering awe, with a doubtful mind, I ventured ed to address this delicate and fairy creation of the sky— “Beautiful Spirit,” I cried, “sweeter than the balm that drops from Arabian trees hath thy sayings come upon me, healing and softening; and once more about my heart have vibrated strings of tenderness, and that which was a barren, scathed, and blighted soil, feels the dew, and fresh green vines spring forth: yet these last are but like girdles round a granite pillar, whose cold and rugged sides mock the softness of their embraces, or I would not, slow of convincement on that which hath formed my food of thoughts for years, inquire at thee—Since man is the cause of his own sorrows, and life might, if rightly used, be made a blessing instead of bale, why is temptation like some enticing courtezan, whose white arms cling about our necks, nor will be loosened until destruction share the embrace, cast in our way at every turn? Why with the witching song of the Syren, are our frail and weakened barks lured from the moonless ocean to the surf-bound rock? Why, in every step we venture, do we run the chance of the pit and the snare? Surely you will not say that we have wisdom and strength enough in ourselves to shun and avoid these dangers—or that it is just that a son should suffer for a father's crime—or that poverty and misery are the consequences of our own imprudence at all times—and further I would ask, why doth the honest man fail, when the knave, by the vilest of means, prospers? What is the use of talent or learning, or honour, when it is given but as a jest for the fool, who, born to wealth and power, delights but in crushing that flower of whose fragrance he is insensible, and whose loveliness he cannot perceive? Why are the feet of the innocent pierced with the sharpest thorns, when the guilty wretch walks the path of pomp and glory?” “Unreflecting mortal!” returned the bright apparition, “would you imply that answers were not easy to be had to these questions, or that the ills which you inveigh against, are wedded to life even as death is inseparable to its close—and these are woes not of your own formation? Have you thought on it, how little are the real wants of human existence? when ye have hungered, hath not the earth an equal heritage to all?—Doth not rich and clustering grapes, like rubies amid the green leaves of the clambering vine, hang free to the hand? Doth not every golden fruit that starts into ripeness from the bosom of earth and blushes in the sun, belong alike to man? When ye have thirsted, doth not water burst from the hill side clearer than crystal, and brighter than the jewelled diamond in a monarch's crest? What should ye seek then?—happiness! and had ye bound your desires no farther than this mere sufferance of nature, ye would have found it; but early ye cast aside the reins of reason—ye grasped ambition by the hand with the love of a bridegroom—from the womb ye were stiff-necked and uncurbed from all authority; and, like the half-tamed steed that hath broken his bridle, and who is stopped by no impediment in his fiery course, but continues his flight with unabated speed, until borne down with fatigue he drops upon the ground and dies,—ye have rushed forth madly into the wide world, acting for yourselves; and ever restless, have rose in rebellion causelessly against heaven, and decried the just decrees of fate itself;—ye have sought, proud in your ideal mightiness, a new temple and a new god; a molten image, wrought from the mine by human labour, have ye worshipped; and what consequence comes of this? what gain hath your folly? ye toil till the veins swell and the sweat pours from your brows like rain drops, and when ye have clasped your idol, ye die!—ye build mighty ships, and plough the unmeasured waters, your souls filled with nought but desires for gold; and ye have your punishment.—For the tempest comes, and the false element ye have trusted, secure in your own strength, buries in its briny masses of waves your weltering corses—ye walk the earth, heaping crime on crime, trespass upon trespass, till there is no end unto your iniquities; what comes of it? plagues are among ye;—ye cannot fly the shafts of the avenger; pestilence walks in the darkness of the night, and ye are swept like dust away; Seek ye for wealth? Murder,—fratricide, becomes in your laws no crime—the sanctity of the grave may be violated, and its buried ashes exposed to the winds; and yet the deed is good;—then were do you seek pleasure? in the arms of harlotry—in the midst of debauchery and dissipation—and so the example of the parent descends to the child; but judgment, that of a just judge, goes down likewise to their posterity—the face that was formed the very model of beauty, is distorted and haggard; that cheek which should have been lovelier than that of spring, blushing beneath the warm gaze of summer, is sallow and wan with disease, seeming a frightful effigy of death, rather than the visage of living man—and are there not legions of the crippled, the blind, and the blighted, from these sources, their own folly and crimes? The fulness of richness begets poverty; should he who hath scattered his gold upon every idle and worthless project, who hath cast his money away on wild carouse and wassail with the gambler and the losel—should he shrink from the suffering that he deserves, and hath brought upon himself? and does he dare call the gift of life a curse, when he alone hath made it such: How the situation of circumstance 2* alters feelings: the poor man supposes that had he wealth he would know how to use it better to the advantage of his creatures than all men who are flourishing in fortune; while the rich believe poverty a thing gentle, and easy to be encountered;—let them have their wish; how soon hath the first forgot that which he intended, and how much harder than dying doth the latter find the wound to which he hath often preached patience and hope; deny not then, that all is well ordered: the fool is born to fortune,—for were it otherwise he would perish for lack of bread and sustenance; and talent is granted, that, in spite of the lowliness of its birth or prospects, it may battle through every storm, and may be equal to bear either the disasters or glories, that are alike the portion of mortality,—yet the human desires have never a sufficiency; no matter what the situation, the same dissatisfaction will exist—they are ever grasping at impossibilities, and there is no portion within the boundary of the far-stretched universe that holds a relief to their insatiable wants.” “But why,” I ventured to seek of the phantom, “hath not virtue, which is so seldom found, the protection it deserves against the persecution of the bad? Why is triumph showered on every offence that is committed against justice or honour? Why hath it even become dangerous to denounce the guilty, and to tear from their blackened visages the mask of hypocrisy, under whose shade they have acted? Doth it merit the prison-house, with cruelty that an age of barbarism would have scorned, the thong, or the public outcry, to disclose the knaveries of the peculator, the vileness and the vicious effeminacy of the debauchee, the criminal intrigues of the selfish politician, the corruptness of the partial judge, the presumption and assurance of the thriftless knave and adventurer, the shallowness of the vain fool and empty coxcomb, who, with unparalleled hardihood, thrust themselves in the place of better men, and with the barefaced impudence, which such as these have always in readiness, busy themselves in every affair, trampling down worth and capability?” “The culpable,” I was answered, “conscious of their own weakness when in comparison to honesty, have flocked together for a mutual support; they have leagued one with another to destroy that which they were unequal to in brightness—as the clouds upon the mountain head are gloomier for the whiteness of the snow which they enshadow, so doth the criminal feel the superior beauty of vir tue, and that which he envies it is natural for him to strive against for ruin; nor is it of moment what ends are used for his object: the cunning of the fox and the quenchless thirst of the ferocious tiger, that hath once lapped human gore,[4] [4] Vide “Sketches of Field Sports in India,” by D. Johnson, 1818. alike assist and urge him on his hateful course; the good have seldom worldly guards, and are ever unsuspecting, and soon fall an easy prey to dark intrigue and persecuting guile—but which is to be envied, the conquered or the conqueror? the first is not abandoned in his fall, for in the howling wilderness, on the stormy ocean, on the bed of death, and in the stony walls of the dank dungeon, doth the pure heart beat free and light, and far happier than the stern victor under the silken canopy; the breath of heaven is ever about the virtuous; health, nursed by ruddy labour, with a colour like the moss rose bud, e'er the sun and dew hath kissed away its delicate and rosy smile, visits the cheek of the lowly, and is wooed by the rich in vain—tenfold are the blessings that wait on the good, even amidst persecution and sorrow, and though surrounded by grandeur and prosperity, the wicked feel the curse: If you believe that vengeance and punishment are not dealt out to the offending, ask at the lone traveller, if o'er the Syrian waste he passed, why the stagnant and dead pool lies in bitter flood above the ancient cities, or why the dire hyena and the jackal's scream heard from among the grass grown halls of the luxurious Persian? and what is now the towering temple of Chaldean Bel? where are the city's hundred brazen gates? her airy gardens—the harnessed chariots of her haughty nobles; yes, the music of the cymbal, lute, and glittering dulcimer, and all the pomp of her unholy worship to her carved gods have passed away—all is a shapeless ruin—desolation's sacred place! the vials of long stored wrath have burst upon the abode of empire, and the pride and terror of the world is now a plain of ashes. Not wrongly do you assert, that it is rash to tear away the cloak beneath which the hideous and secret designs of vice are fostered, for is it safe to pluck up the rushes that overshadow the couch of the venomous snake?—it is not in the hope nor in the power of one single being to prostrate the evil of his species, and he is unworthy of his task if he cannot bear without suffering (when knowing the reason and the source,) the wretched revilings of his enemies; when the hunter pursues the desert leopard, knows he not that every barb that pierces the wild animal's spotted hide, renders him more savage; and when the villanies of man are exposed, does it not render him the more revengeful? He that cries out against crime, places his hand in the nest of the adder—for wealth feels that he is its foe—for the many find that the hidden deeds of their own hearts are brought to day, and all are conscious of their deformities. Is it not natural then that the wounded should hate him who struck the blow? and is it not to be supposed that every means would be employed to trample down to dust the presumptuous unmasker of iniquity. And what is to be sought for or to be expected from the dastard and despicable spirit—the low, mean, and grovelling souls of the coward, the convicted slanderer, the timeserving sycophant, the conceited fool, the selfish hypocrite, and the venal tool of every paymaster—if fate, aided by corrupted justice, for awhile should place their foe in thraldom, where he is open to their attack and is unable to defend himself:—nothing but such pitiful revenge, as contemptible minds alone can dictate, and with which the souls of the most despised wretches are familiar. Look at this allegory, and mark the lesson you behold, and bethink thee how much more noble and worthy, and deserving of praise, (which it will receive in spite of malice) is virtue persecuted, than vice that attempts to triumph over it.” As the last words were uttered, the slender and lithe figure before me waved in motion like the light cypress, when the breeze awakens music in its boughs, while the waves of the sunlight parted with the movement of its white arms, and I beheld in its hands something that approached to the likeness of a clear and transparent mirror. I gazed therein as commanded, and there lay, stretched out before me, an extensive landscape of a wild, trackless, and wooded country: the sky would have been clear above, but some light clouds wandered on its surface, like the fears e'en happy love must know. But in the foreground of this pictured resemblance of nature, was the object that soon attracted my attention: it was a gallant and noble lion caught in the wily snare of the forester, and bound in every limb tight as by cords of iron, in a mesh more closely woven than the nest of the spider. In vain did he strive to tear his hateful bonds asunder; his matchless strength was of no avail in his agony, and his fierce endeavours served but to rob him of his remaining vigour; heavy moans burst from his bosom in sorrow, and black despair had made an entrance into his heart. At this moment, there sprang briskly from an adjoining thicket an ass,[5] [5] I leave the characters that figure in the above allegory as well as its object, unto those diviners who think the matter worth the trouble of elucidating. It was my intent to have fitted each garment to its wearer, but better reflection recalled to my mind the saying of Lorenzo Di Medici, when asked who were most prodigal of their time, he answered, “those who waste it in describing fools.” whose hide bore such deep and recent marks of the lion's fangs, that had it not been for the overweening length of his ears, it might have been a difficult thing to distinguish of what class of animals he belonged; no sooner, however, did he behold the king of quadrupeds than planting his hoofs upon the ground, he shook in very terror, until the sweat poured down his sides, but after awhile, perceiving the object of his fears lay prostrate and stirred not, as though dead, his horror began slowly to disperse, and mustering courage, he slowly approached, though cautiously, at every step glancing his eye back, like a sensible ass, to secure a retreat in case of danger. After having, however, perceived the forlorn situation of his foe, all dread in an instant fled his heretofore doubtful mind, and prancing about he brayed loudly and lustily for joy; and taking courage, from the advantageous state of circumstances, he at first boldly struck up the dust against the enthralled beast, and then most valiantly ventured to strike the prisoner with his hoof; then indeed did the generous beast feel the coward indignity, and roared aloud in scorn upon his pusillanimous tormentor, whose timorous heart died within him at the sound, and braying with affright, he fled with speed in the deepest of the forest. But the sound of his voice had roused the tenants of the woods, of whom many had felt the power of the lion, and when they learnt his bondage, they all rushed, many whom he never injured, to enjoy the dastard pleasure of adding to his misery. First came an ourang-outang, an animal who walked strait upright like a man, and imitated a great number of his actions more than any other brute, but of a bald and unsavoury look; but believing itself an animal of greater pretensions than others, it stood apart, and with hideous chatterings, and owlish grimaces, kept urging its companions forward to their sport. Next came, with all the gravity of an alderman, a churlish and savage looking ape, who, having picked a stone out of a mud puddle, cast it against the side of the chained monarch of the woods; but it being of a soft and dirty substance, ere it struck the lion it divided, and fell into pieces of its original composition. But it were wasting time to describe minutely the herd of creatures that followed, suffice it, they were all of the lowest species, and tortured by the meanest tricks. And there were not wanting birds of the air to fill the train: there was the musical owl, with all the appearance of wisdom; and there was the goose with its kingly stride; and lastly the dunghill cock, that sought the shelter of the barn door at every notice of battle; the spotted and venomous toad leaped forward in the crowd, while the gouty and bloated blue-bottle, the very image of some black-robed hypocrite, was droning about with its teasing and tiresome hum. “Such,” continued the Spirit, as I withdrew my eyes from the representation of the objects presented by the glass, “even as actuate these that I have shown, are the spiteful and gall-overflowing feelings of the hearts of those who are wanting in mind, honour, and every ennobling quality, and he that can feel ought but scorn and contempt for such beings as are possessed of feelings of this kind, is fit alone to herd with them; while that man, who, armed in defence of Vol. I. 3 virtue, though for a time he may be overborne by mean intrigue and dastard subtlety, will flourish in respect, and daily feel and behold the success of his labours in spite of persecution.”**** Suddenly, the voice of the shadowy being with whom I held converse, ceased, and I perceived its figure grew fainter and fainter on my sight, though retaining its beauty to the end, as the pale stars that linger last in the train of departing night, until the whole vision totally disappeared, leaving not a trace behind, like the fading of a white translucent cloud that hangs in the trackless path of the summer moon. I gazed with intense interest until not a lineament of form was visible, and strained to catch a last glimpse of the departing vision, but it was in vain, the sunbeam itself, in whose dazzling light it seemed to live, was gone, for the orb, of which it was a ray, had folded its wings of golden fire, after its long and weary travel, and sought to enter the cloud pavilion of its rest like a crowned bridegroom, glowing with rich and purple gleams, while hundreds of shapes seemed gathering in its train, of bright domes and groves, of golden spires and armed and gigantic warriors, about whose way as around the destroying angel, rose clouds of dust along the silent, thronged, and living sky; but soon all passed away, even like the pageant of a dream, and dark low mists began to creep in lazy folds along the house-tops, while afar off from out the eastern gates, like to the blossoms of the almond tree, that branch out in knots of silver, came forth the glittering stars, the harbingers of night. I had gratified the first and favourite longing of my soul; that for which for years I had thirsted, with a deep unquenchable desire. I had discoursed with a creature of a different element from that to which I was condemned to toil in, and yet I felt disturbed and disappointed, there were a thousand things I should have sought —a thousand inquiries I had neglected, a thousand doubts that I would have solved. I had my wish, but still I felt irresolute and hesitating, and as I looked upon the closing heaven, I felt as though I scarce believed that which had past a reality—`Is it not possible,' I thought, `that I have deceived myself with a creation of my own brain; can this have happened, or hath my imagination, lost to reason, built up this wild fancy, this airy fabric;—for it is not within the bounds prescribed to the knowledge of mortality, that the secrets of another world should be thus idly disclosed, that bright beings, whose dwellings and substance are beyond mortal divination, should thus reveal themselves to human sight, or hold words of intercourse with living man, yet I have not slept, nor hath there been a lethargy upon me, my blood rushes free in its currents through my veins; still e'er now I have had wakening thoughts, mad, wild, and singular as this, on which I now am misled, and even as now I have remembered the words and circumstances as palpably as though acted in life, of visionary characters that had no existence, except in the strange phantasies of my own o'er-wrought brain.' The melodious song of the bird of night that loves the rose, and if eastern tales speak true, lives almost on its perfume, rose to my ear from a tender bough beneath my window; it stole upon my busied mind, and roused me from reflection—I started impatiently from my seat, and was about to pace the apartment, when by accident, or induced by the tenor of my late reverie, I cast my eye towards the spot where the phantom had stood, when, to my astonishment, on the very place, where, with its silver brilliance, the sunlight had kissed the floor, I beheld something white and motionless; with eager step I rushed to grasp the object of my wonder, almost believing as I approached it, a deception of my vision; I snatched it in my hand—it was a roll of paper, huge, and folded carefully; I burst the strings that bound it, in haste, and with hand that trembled in unison with my doubting heart, and straining my sight, I traced the letters of the direction: gentle reader, to my astonishment, I discovered the manuscript of the following pages; here was new matter for speculation and surprise, and whether it was a confirmation that I had indeed felt the presence of a Spirit, or whether the hand of mortal man had conveyed the writings to my chamber, is what I am even now unable to solve. The text in which the papers were written, seemed aged and antiquated, the ink yellowed, dried, and pallid, so as in many places to be scarcely legible; the mouth of time appeared to have decayed many pages, which were shrivelled with damp, and fell to dust when touched, and which I have been forced to supply to continue the thread of the narrative, and I have also altered many passages and sentiments which were expressed in obsolete and ancient phrases, into a modern form, and as I found some parts were likely to involve historical discussions, and feeling my own small informa tion on the time of the action to be very slight and deficient, I have undertaken to call to my assistance the pen of a philosopher and scholar already well known to the public,[6] [6] Peradventure it here appeareth, that meus amicus (the inditer) intends a delicate and sufficient compliment to my erudition, which hath been heretofore exercised for the benefit of the world in a certain learned commentary to a little work; though one that beareth great fame.—Ter. Phlog. and I trust his judicious remarks and learned illustrations interspersed through the work, will meet that favour with all that they so justly deserve.

The Old Couple. On the north eastern extremity of the island of Manahadoes, or New-York, lies a small track of flatland backed by a hilly country, and bordered by a narrow river, which seems to have taken its rise from the rapid current of the sound, flowing between the two shallow channels formed by the shores of the lesser Barn islands and the mainland. On this level spot, tradition[7] [7] Historical Illustration.—Albeit, after abstruse and minute investigation thereon, and consultation with divers wise and oral authorities, it indubitably appeareth unto me, that the tradition in the text hath imperative foundation—and the place above named, taketh precedence by three years of the present site, although it hath in no wise been so represented by any author who hath written on the antiquities of the island: howbeit, a personage of extreme research, whose portraiture in a snuff-coloured coat, doubtless on account of his learning, sitteth on the top of a book case in the library of our Historical Society[8] [8] A note upon a note, (being a shrewd commentary by the printer's devil.)—I presume the reader has learnt that a society of this designation is in existence—if not, I refer him to the daily papers; for it is famous in advertisements and puffs—its true object, however, is to make new members by way of a show off to the president, who has always a standing speech ready for all occasions—while ancient cobwebs, and venerable dust, have ensheathed the records of antique lore, which, like tools in the hands of the ignorant remain unemployed—unopened on the undisturbed shelves, nor will be removed except by the palm of the auctioneer. In short, whatever this society might have been, it is now but a mere sinecure of adulation to one or two individuals—who, not content with having ruined it by their extravagance, are fast bringing it in disgrace by their ignorance, selfishness and conceit. (which inclosure mentioned, holdeth not a single volume—but is by its grave emptiness, a type or symbol of the deliberations of its owners) affirmeth to the fact, as he doth by multitudinous other facts, which from such affirmation becometh stubborn. T. P. relates that the gallant Hendrick Hudson, on his second expedition to the mighty waters that now bear his name, in the year sixteen hundred and ten, by order of the Dutch East India Company, in whose service he sailed, landed and marked out the plan of a small settlement, which, in honour to a favourite officer of the Half Moon, (which was the name of the stout and gallant bark in which the discoverer voyaged) who had derived his birth in the famous town of Harlæm in the Low Countries, he called after that place; it was not long, however, before the disadvantage of forming the colony in this spot was experienced by the adventurers, who, though they at that early period could scarcely be supposed to have dreamt of the gigantic city and immense commerce which was to spring from the desert and desolate strand, whereon the roving spirit of enterprize, and the daring cupidity for wealth and possession, had induced them to cope with the “wild salvage” in his wilderness, and the piercing arrows of the northern frost; yet they soon found great inconvenience from the lowness of the water that formed their haven, for the larger supply ships which in the season following their first embarkation, arrived from Holland, were not able to be brought to the landing beneath the small palisade which had been erected to preserve the colonists from the irruptions of the fierce Maquaas, as the Indian nation who held their hunting grounds adjacent, were termed: it became therefore, absolutely necessary for the company's agent to select a new site for building the intended capital of the stadholder's dominions in the western world, which should possess a harbour for receiving and preserving, during the rigours of the winter, the vessels freighted with stores and other necessaries for the hardy settlers. The Dutchman is ever constitutionally slow at motion;—it was, therefore, with many sighs for the favourite spot they were leaving, which, with its low marshy plain and beautiful prospect of water, so much reminded them of the dykes and the blooming fields of the Hague, that the adventurers removed to the south-western point of the island, which, projecting in a spacious bay formed by the confluence of the Hudson river and the streight or oost vloed[9] [9] Now called the East River. between the Long Island and the northern shore, afforded them every convenience for a noble haven. They here laid the foundation of a fort, which was called Amsterdam—and erected a few log huts: in a short period, however, these hardy Netherlanders, being undisturbed by the native owners of the soil, the warlike tribes of savages who dwelt near them, conquered the stubborn difficulties that nature had cast in their path of labour. As the new village grew, the old one decayed; and in a little time, Harlæm had nearly resumed the appearance of its nativity, ere the arrival of the fearless navigator and his crew. No voice broke the gloomy solemnity of neglect that enveloped it; the sharp hiss of the rattlesnake, and the baying of the brindled wolf, reigned once more, where so lately, yet for so short a time, the echoes of civilized life had usurped the long scream of the monarch eagle as he sailed through the earth-shadowing clouds towards his mountain throne, amid the lofty solitude of the towering Kaatskill, stole on the sleep of midnight that lay upon this scarce trodden strand; its airy reverberations unbroken by the startling shout of the hunter, or the shot of the arquebuse: the mullien stalk and the dock weed grew in the pathways, while the green and slender creeper climbed up the walls of the crumbling blockhouse, and the wild sumach shook its scarlet berries to the wind, where the bright standard of their high mightinesses the states-general, had first been unfurled, and floated in the breezes of the new continent. Years stole away, and glided in the mass of time: the new city prospered: governors came from the mother country gifted with powers to reward the deserving, and to give laws to the new found province: commerce with the neighbouring settlements of England and Sweden, opened doors of wealth to the growing colony, which, like a blooming and healthful child upon its mother's bosom, glowed with gathering strength and happiness: the dark and mocassined forester brought his richest furs, and the fragrant spices of the western Indias found their way to the rocky banks of the lordly Hudson: the smooth hand of agriculture and unceasing industry, soon changed the giant mountain to the smiling garden: the brown and antlered deer tossed up his head, and springing from his leafy covert, fled before the face of the European: the harsh whoop of the Indian, was more seldom heard from the pinnacle of the spiring crag, or the howl of the fierce and bloody panther, from the dark pine forest: where the herds of roaming buffalo had grazed, the jocund harvest laughed: the white sails of the schuit, like light clouds upon the bosom of the waters, were now seen daily hovering o'er the broad expanse of the river of Mountains[10] [10] Riviere des Montagnes was one of the ancient names of the Hudson—it was supposed by some to be of Spanish origin, but by others, this name is thought to be a mere corruption of Manathans. to the Taappan Zee, where heretofore none but the bark pirogue had glided: the mirrored sheet of wave, whose glass had alone reflected the savage features of the Mohiccan,† † The Mohiccans were part of the river Indians—they were descendants of the Delawares, or Lenni Lenape, and a branch from the nation occupied the island of New-York—which from their name, was called “Manathans'—the appellation of Mohegan was also given to the Hudson. and the dancing feathers that adorned his head as he leaned from his canoe in its birdlike course, now gave back the floating mantle of the foreigner, and the flaunting bandrols of a distant nation: honesty, unshaking virtue and truth, (how different from our times!) characterised the low country emigrants and their immediate posterity: they therefore (although the fortune of these qualities are now reversed, being all three in miserable bad repute) prospered, and their city spread; by degrees the black mud hovel and the rough log hut disappeared, and the brown and glazed tile, and the small yellow brick, imported from the Vaderlandt,‡ ‡ Brick was imported from Holland, and sold for $4 16 per thousand, payable in beavers, Nov. 19, 1661. Records of Nieuw Nederlandts. took their place, and glistened beneath the joyous rays of the golden sun in Nieuw Amsterdam. The evident prosperity of the new territory of the United Provinces, however, unfortunately for that power, opened the eyes of desire and envy to their European neighbours, the English; large bodies of whom flying from the iron hand of persecution, that religious intolerance had stretched over them in their native country, had sought the freedom of worship in the boundless deserts of America; where, forgetful of the misfortunes and the oppression they had suffered in their own land, (such is the ungrateful nature of man) as their strength of population increased, with unheard of cruelties, with fire and sword, with murder and torture, they wrested the country from the Indian, who in the hour of their mourning and distress, who in the bitterness of their exile, had granted them a refuge and a home; who, when they could have overpowered and massacred them to a man, as easy as one might destroy a viper in its egg, held forth the hand of peace to the destitute, and smoked the calumet of amity with the stranger;—and the distressed were succoured, and rested secure among the children of the wilderness, unharmed by the red tomahawk of war— when in the country of civilization, they met not the grasp of brotherhood, but the axe of death and the embrace of the loathsome prison house; they built their altar on the wild shore, and its incense rose free as the untrammelled elements: they planted their feet upon a foreign strand which clung to their steps in friendship, receiving them in its bosom like a parent doth its weeping offspring:—and these men thus received, were the venom darting snakes that hid amidst the verdant and beautiful grass of the savanna, whose treacherous poison concealed within the surrounding loveliness, is the first to spread its death to the deceived and trusting traveller: for, unmindful of the vast benefits bestowed in their hour of nakedness, no sooner were they grown to strength, than that country in which they were but guests, they claimed as theirs by right: that spot on which they were by sufferance, they haughtily deemed as owning by chartered dominion: the parchment deed of a monarch whose empire was divided from it by a world, the deep and turblous ocean, had given a title to the soil that his predecessor knew not existed in creation—placing their fellow men merely because art had given a superiority that virtue wanted, upon the footing of the wild animals of the woods:—they hunted the red Indian from his home—tore up the olive stalk that he had planted—drove him from his cedar wigwam, until at last, treachery, aided by the deadly inventions of what is termed civilization, left him not a rood of the land of his fathers; but like the birds, driven by the approaching winter, he sought another climate and peace beyond the great lakes; so that in a few years, throughout the vast country of New England, all that remained of the wielders of the bow, was here and there a green and flowery mound, within whose silent bosom mouldered the skeleton of some warrior, who, happier than his living brethren, crumbled to dust in the land of his birth, though his chichung[11] [11] The shadow or spirit, which the Indians believe survives the body, that it may rejoin its departed friends in an unknown country, which they suppose is in the south—where they are to enjoy every kind of happiness; and what they believe will add much to their pleasures is, that they should never become weary or satiated. Vid. Indian Wars. had gone southward to the unknown paradise, where, never weary of the hunt, the feast, and the dance, it sported in the shadowy revels of its fellow heroes. With such lovers of encroachment, and men so greedy of possession, it was not to be supposed that the unoffending Netherlanders would remain long undisturbed—no sooner did the wily puritan become aware of his power, and see the weakness and the good nature with which the Hollander bore his approaches, than no barrier of existing peace, no legal right of boundary, stopped his covetous advances; that selfish avarice that lusts after the fruits which the toils of another hath matured, was awakened, and little by little, by overreaching cunning and dastard subtlety, was the country snatched from its first settlers, until at last the mask being entirely thrown off, the whole territory held by the Dutch, was seized on by the English crown. The inhabitants of Nova Belgia had all the peaceable and substantial qualities, that characterized their merchant ancestors; the scion, though engrafted in another soil, showed all the solid virtue of the parent stock—neither had a climate of increased cold, nor the necessary bustle attending the settlement of a new country, added ought to their constitutional activity: their standing maxim was still the same—that all matters must take their required time—for that which is finished hastily, is sure to be executed indifferently;—No! things were not done in our hurried flimsy way—few men built their houses in a week, as is proved by the stout dutch walls, that give our modern improvers of building such trouble to demolish—however, a frequent breasting of the cold northern storm, and the cutting winds, which gathered in their rushing flight strength from the tops of the snowy mountains, and the ice prisoned lagoons, may have given to their native phlegm, a testiness of temper and irascibility in little matters, that is seldom enjoyed by their fellow traders of the Scheldt,—for in his contests with the tempest, the New Amsterdamer had acquired a necessary length of breath or wind, that was aroused on the slightest occasion, by a helping activity of tongue:—and this propensity hath descended to this æra in a most admirable degree—for it is now the mode, as well as then, to make a great noise about nothing, and to take no notice of concerns of moment; and indeed from this cause, it may be that all public undertakings are begun by talking, and therefore are accustomed to end in smoke: from hence it is not to be wondered at, that after quietly submitting to the change, the placable burghers of Nieuw Nederland remained, with slight variation, in passive subjection to their new masters. It is true, there might have been a noisy meddlesome fellow, who was out at the elbows, and had a hungry eye for preferment, who, like the office hunter at an election, blustered himself into a passion, and strived to kick up a dust among peaceable people by alarming them with a cry that “the nation would be ruined”—but as his wind was always spent, and his breath shortened, as his own private object was attained, and it was found that bread was not dearer, or stock[12] [12] I opine that this must be an interpolation by a modern hand— seeing that history giveth no light on the subject—nor, after mature deliberation, hath it been demonstrated to me, that there was ought of stocks in the ancient day in Nova Belgia, unless peradventure, it were those for corporeal punishment, being used as restrictions to the legs and neck of a person, who, having committed a criminal delict, incurred the penalty thereof—howbeit, there beareth an appearance of similitude to that of these times—for they were of wood, which merely wanted rottenness to give a type of their modern namesake—T. P. fallen, so they deemed it prudent to bear the yoke in patience— they enjoyed the liberty of their native religion, and held rights of citizenship on an equality with their conquerors:—it differed in truth, but little to Mienheer, at least in appearance, if he could sit in the summer's sun, and puff the swelling cloud from his nose, that gathered from his long `pyp,' drink his `zoopje,' and see his Holland pinks and bloemates flourish, whether he obeyed the laws of `My lords, the High and mighty states-general,'† † Vid. Stuyvesant's letter to Col. Nichols.—Smith's History of New-York, p. 24, Lond. 1774. and the Dutch East India Company, or the arbitrary edicts enacted at Hempstead, by the deputies of the Duke of York‡ ‡ Jus Novæ Eboracensis vel, leges illustrissimo principe Jacobi Duce Eboraci et Albanæ, etc. institutæ et ordinatæ, ad observandum in territoriis America; transcriptæ Anno Domini, 1674. Vol. I. 4 —And it was not until the country had been many years in the possession of the English at the opening of this narration, that the seeds of disaffection took root against the existing power—and doubtless many of those dreadful convulsions that soon followed and shook the province of New-York, (as it was now called) in 1689, in favour of the Prince of Orange, who was then aiming to ascend the throne of his father-in-law, the weak and bigoted James the Second, of England, may be in part attributed to the popish measures, and high hand used by Sir Edmond Andross, who, about thirty years before the revolution in favour of William the Third, was commissioned as governor of King James' (then Duke of York) patent in America and is related by history to have been a man perfectly devoted to the arbitrary views of his tyrannical and misguided sovereign—so much so, as to have drawn down upon him the universal odium and hatred of the people he governed. It was not, however, until the spring of the year above named, that the coals of discontent, which had every where been strewn throughout the wide extent of colony, burst in a flame; for finding the toleration of his religion, the shrines at which his fathers had knelt, threatened, the Dutchman roused him from his torpidity, and joined with the English follower of Calvin, to withstand the encroachments of the Church of Rome, and the overbearing arrogance of their papist rulers. However, even at this early period, New-York was tainted with some of the corruption and selfishness, that hath ever been its leading traits—there were then also, as now, men who were of that careful principle to know which was the strongest, and the party most likely to conquer, before they made their choice or espousal—no matter whether the cause was just or holy— that hath ever been a minor consideration—and as there hath since been, men were not wanting who carried their consciences in their pocket, and were ever ready to change sides as it suited their own private interest; that province, therefore, was not the first which roused and turned the bold face of resistance to the advancing oppressor, but for awhile stood apart as though weighing its gain or loss in the opening contest—while the free spirit which the New Englander appears to have imbibed from his birth, like a thing breathed for the vital air of life, and the detestation which he seems to have ever alike felt for any encroachment on the liberty of man, here breathed itself forth; and like the field fire, caught and spread in every place where it could find entrance— from the halls of the rich, to the naked and smoky caverns of the poor—from the smiling circle round the burgher's evening hearth, to the solitary heath, the midnight resting place of the belated hunter. Like the majestic tulip-tree, once the giant of the American forest, towered the pervading flame above all lesser interest, the deputed tyrant sunk like a stripling beneath the vigorous arm of manhood before it; he that had stretched forth the hand of iron above his subject, as though men were but created for his tyranny, he that had considered those whom fate and the fragile wax of commission had given a momentary sway and rule, but as the slaves of his desires, the tools of his commands—he even in the day of his grandeur, in the height of his power, quailed, weak and shivering, before its advances. The investments of office, the privileges of station granted by the sovereign, were but as atoms in the wind—the dust of the desert, the withered remnants of autumnal leaves before the driving blast. The ruler found himself but as a reed, the very breath of the people bent him to the earth— the crafty and overbearing Sir Edmund Andross, met the due reward of his arrogance and artful machinations, in a deserved and unpitied imprisonment, and soon found himself fortunate, in being allowed without scath of life or limb, to depart from the country where he so late had been obeyed in terror and disgust, and return to the superstitious monarch, from whom he had derived his ill used authority. At length after due interval, encouraged by the boldness of this resolute and gallant conduct, the citizen of New-York awoke to the call, which, like a trumpet clear and shrill, sounded in a note of thunder from the grey shores of the Atlantic, to the lakes—but it was as the wearied lion rousing him from his slumber at the distant echoes of the chace; for at that time, early as it was, the seed of disunion was rooted, which hath since flourished to the disgrace of the present day—the rich were too proud, as now, to mingle or follow even in a good cause with the poor—and these last were idle and disunited; for in truth, most men are too selfish to risk one atom of their convenience, to public safety— there are indeed but few persons, who do not admire to be considered as the leaders in matters of importance, and are vastly tickled as such, at reading their name in print— but they want all this without trouble—and thus it hath become the custom to thrust people in the public eye, who make a great fuss for the newspapers; and then, go home and set by their fires. At the period in question, the vulgar were divided, abused and misled by the senseless arguments, and intrigues of designing knaves and busy sharpers; who realized to their gaping listeners, the ancient fable of the dog and the shadow; for our own eyes have proved to us, that none fatten on the advice of these characters, except themselves—for while they cajole the greedy multitude with fine speeches, they, amid all the disinterested patriotism, which is sure to be placed uppermost in their sentiments, like froth upon the wave, and always forms the garb of these deceivers, make out to juggle them of every right and every gift of power, from whence a shred may be gained.—Indeed New-York from such causes, presents a disgraceful spectacle, for its extent, and population, and resources—its offices of trust and moment, are mostly held by those whose origin, whose life, whose actions, befit them better for the gallows, than the representatives of a majestic state—for if by chance a man of worth attains station, a thousand engines, mean and despicable as those who use them, are set in play by the envious and malignant, to destroy him, and in reality, such hath become the reputation of the places, which are showered now alone on those whom Cromwell hath designated as “waiters upon providence,” the artful and corrupt office seekers of the day, (for it is a rare and unprecedented thing to bestow ought on honest men, who are not unblushing dust-lickers and hypocrites) that the moral part of the community, those who hold a pride in themselves of conscious integrity, have almost considered it a disgrace to succeed as incumbents—and to take the situations of those wretches who have concealed the rags and dirt of their true standard in society, beneath accumulations from the national purse; or to sit as Judges after men who sacrifice justice, their consciences—if they ever possessed any—and their duty to honesty, “to satisfy the feelings” of some political partisan. After this detail, the reader will not be surprised, that while the rich, the powerful, and those whose province, it might have been supposed from their situations in life, it was to step forward as leaders in times of distress, turmoil and danger, held aloof, prudently debating the odds and chances to themselves in case of success or defeat, and anxiously watched the aspect of affairs, that they might not be too late to kiss the feet of the victor, and claim a reward for services they never performed—that there arose a champion for the people in one Jacob Leisler; a man in the middle order of life, though of considerable esteem, and having a certain popularity attached to him from his descent, from the Dutch portion of the populace—yet no being (says history) could be more ill adapted to conduct and guide a bold and hazardous enterprise, wherein aught of management, mind or resolution, were required—his fortune was moderate, and he was destitute of every qualification that could gain him adherents; for however great his personal courage, he was proverbially ignorant, and dependant on the guidance of others—yet with all these imperfections, he succeeded in his most extraordinary attempt of overthrowing the established government of greater part of the colony—for fired at the same time by ambition of power, and inflamed by revenge—for during the administration of Andross in the province, he had been an object of persecution, from his turbulence of spirit to the government—he formed the perilous design of seizing the city for the aspiring William, who was now contending for the throne of his father-in-law. To accomplish this, Leisler, urged to haste by the success of the eastern country, and aided by one Milbourne, an Englishman 4* related to him by marriage, brought over and armed in his league, a small body of citizens, who had been enrolled under his command, for the purpose of patroling at night through the different out wards and skirts of the town. At the head of these, by a sudden and unexpected attack, he surprised the royal garrison who protected the fort—the troops were easily overcome, making but a slight defence, and without difficulty submitted to the views of the insurgents, who, by this blow, found themselves undisputed masters of the counties of New-York and East Chester. Accordingly, they lowered the standard of the Stuarts, and administered the oath of allegiance to their Protestant successor:—and at the same time, taking advantage of the ambiguous wording of a despatch that arrived from England, Leisler assumed to himself the title of Lieutenant Governor, and instituted a council, the regular heads of authority having sought safety in flight; in the meanwhile he sent home an agent to London, who might early on the succession of the Stadtholder, claim the expected rewards and favours due to the signal devotion that he had shown to his cause. But Leisler's new dignity sat uneasy on him—it has been often seen that a rise to unbounded power, from comparative insignificance and dependence, is sure to bring on a man's destruction—it is not alone that he may act indiscreetly, and bear with unbecoming pride his new gotten consequence—yet he has more to fear from those whom he trusts—from those whom he heaps his friendship on, his partisans, than the open hostility of his foes; the flower that grows to perfection in a day, veins not the earth with its roots—so on the very foundation on which he hath risen, he will totter.—The investiture of supreme authority over the province, and the prospect of the new king's approbation of his proceedings, could not but excite the jealousy of those who had not joined in the revolution, and hence, together with the impossibility to satisfy the insatiable demands of needy adherents, arose the aversion which was shown to the man and his measures by many individuals; however, finding it in vain at first to stem the current of Leisler's influence, Nicholas Bayard and Van Kortlandt, the late mayor of the city, who were the leaders of the opposition, retired hastily to Beverwyck, which is now called Albany, and urged the rulers of that city to refuse communication with the revolutionists, and with such industrious hatred and animosity, fomented the misunderstanding, that the affairs of the public became greatly embarrassed. The safety of the country itself, was also extremely endangered by the ill will and vexatious conduct of the rival parties, who, occupied with their own jarring, respectively sought to injure each other, until they came to open rupture of arms—of course, to this internal enemy of civil war, was sacrificed the defences necessary by the convulsions of the times, against a formidable and foreign adversary; for while the one was inebriated by new and unaccustomed greatness, and the other could not brook, from their former standing, submission to a man mean in his abilities, and inferior in degree, the drum was sounding, and the sword and spear were glittering on the frontiers. France had taken the part of the dethroned and exiled sovereign, and hostilities had commenced against England:—an officer of courage and talent, (the Count De Frontenac,) well acquainted with the situation of the disturbed and distracted province, held the command of the Canadas; who, with an unceasing industry, seeking to add to the distress of the English, early in the contest; contrived to stir up the savages against them; for angered by numerous wrongs, they were ever ready to wreak deserved vengeance on the white oppressors of their fathers; all was in alarm—the tomahawk and scalping knife found numerous victims, and the lily of the Bourbons was crimsoned in blood. At the same period, the broad seas were swarmed with rovers of the most desperate character, whose whole thirst seemed rapine and cruelty; and whose boldness and temerity was much augmented, by the apparent insufficiency of the authorities to suppress them:—scarce a sail could plough the waters, without her decks becoming the stage of slaughter and of robbery—the trade of the Indian islands and the Spanish main, was nearly destroyed; and such was the audacity of this maritime banditti, that neither disparity of force daunted, nor laws human or divine, restrained them from the most wicked and savage atrocities. The numerous inlets and coves of shallow water, where they could neither be pursued or attacked to advantage, that line the Long Island and the entrances of the New-York harbour, afforded these desperadoes convenient concealment and lurking places for depositing their plunder, or hiding their swift craft, when chaced by a superior force, or while watching the departure of some outward bound trader, who, from its rich cargo, was worthy of making prize. The city itself, gave by its countenance to the buccaneers, an excellent market for the disposal of the booty accumulated by their bloody expeditions—it is of indifference to most persons, so as they gain by the bargain, how, or by what deed, he of whom they purchased, became an owner; the honest winkelier cared not, so as he could dispose of them at three times the rate of cost, to some vain and greedy dame—that the Spanish silk, the tissue, or the brocade, that adorned his shelves, were not yet dry of the gore of their last wearers,—the klopliediew, as he gloated over treasures of ingots and golden moidores that now swelled his coffers, and as his daughter simpered as she hung to the yellow beads that enchained her neck, the glittering cross of silver that had adorned the soft bosom of some Peruvian beauty, gave not a thought of the raging ball that had been ruthlessly buried in the hearts of the unfortunates who had once delighted in their possession. So far indeed did the evil extend, and such was the weakness of the laws, which have not as yet been improved—that as at present, the murderer, the robber and the rogue, walked the streets without fear of punishment, if they had but wealth, or were but sticklers to a party—for justice is not made for these; and many of the principal inhabitants, were known to be in open connexion with this illicit trade. Every retailer of the laws, was, as now, fearful of offending some powerful character, or a sputtering and noisy partisan; and therefore, though edict after edict was promulgated, the penalties were scarcely enforced—for they were but as Corporation ordinances—mere dead letters—to be left on the shelf as soon as enacted, hereafter for the wonder of the antiquary[13] [13] It appeareth most veritably unto my investigation, that this and the like references in the narration, (albeit, there being as must be perceived, many strange lucubrations therein, that applieth to modern times, as it would seem from a superficial acceptation thereof) nathless their wording, designate in their true meaning some past period, peradventure the era whereat the historie was indited; howbeit, of the precise time thereof I am greatly in dubitation, seeing that in the text there are divers digressions and multifarious insinuations that approximate unto matters and men, whereof it strikes my imagination there hath been an existence in mine own memorial of events. Nathless adverse to such conclusion (and therefrom I am somewhat inclined to hesitate ere an ultimate decision,) many circumstances detailed have the strongest evidence of an ancient origin, and must have happened perforce in the very observance of the relater; yet assuredly from the style of the text itself, where left by my erudite and learned friend (the editor) in its pristine orthography, stubborn arguments might be drawn as to the first supposition; and even from the words under consideration in this annotation, might be inferred an insuperable convincement thereof:—for peradventure, understanding it that the laws were dead letters at the time of the inditing of the narrative, there would be an excellent agreement and association in the particulars thereof, with the height of civilization whereat our era hath arrived; for the modern system of philanthropy (to which I am a convert, detesting all barbarous customs wherein the infliction of corporeal laceration or restriction is included,) abrogates and abolishes the exercise of the statutes, albeit when the application thereof tendeth to harm society. Whereby I mean to admit that there existeth the letter of the law, but it is truly an inanimate and dead letter, as the text expresseth it, for the spirit thereof is construed, not the word. And peradventure this is right in penal laws, for in the enactment thereof, the legislator intendeth of a surety that the spirit should be taken, and not the words wherein he expresseth himself. Albeit the intention of penal laws goeth in these times no further than to clear the country of useless population— poor pennyless vermin, who from want commit paltry depredations, and are utterly inapplicable to people of consequence and wealth who have by accident come within the jurisdiction thereof. And to show this position to be sound, I will refer unto a late enactment* * Vide. Laws of New-York, vol. 4, 1818. of the wise and accurate statesmen under whose rule we abide, which condemns in case of the commission of certain trespasses which the law reciteth, the directors of a certain hamlet, (therein called “the trustees of the village,”) to be “impounded in the common pound;” and before they can be loosed from such confinement, they are doomed to “pay the keeper and all costs.” Now, as there cometh to my knowledge no enforcement of the letter of this law, I take it to be truly a dead letter, and only construed according to the spirit thereof; whereby stray cattle are impounded in the place of the trustees. T. P. —affording no good, except to the printer or the paper maker, whose profits never have been known to make a retrenchment in a city feast. At times, I will allow, the records commemorate the vigilance of some pettifogging attorney, who was the king's prosecutor for the day—who with extraordinary eagerness, and with inflexible impartiality, had laid hold of some poor devil whom nobody cared about, who had ignorantly sinned against the statute, and verily skinned him to the bone in terrorem, for the wonder of the gaping multitude—who were always mightily pleased at such stern proofs of the unimpeachable purity of the criminal code of the Nieuw Nederlandts: but, mutatis mutandis, did some low mongrel, without influence or money, presume to whisper to Mr. attorney, that such a burgomaster had been seen smuggling contraband goods into the Stadt, and such an echevin was concerned in certain unlawful transactions, be assured the affair was very differently looked upon—the wily lawyer would find out the proof was insufficient, or it was a matter of too little consequence to trouble the court withal, or it was a dangerous precedent to meddle with persons of respectability, or as it was only the fourth complaint, that he would speak with Mynheer, that he might be warned for the future; or that he was too busy in waiting the result of the election,[14] [14] The colonial elections of New-York, particularly for members of the Provincial Assemblies were carried on with uncommon virulence between the opposing factions of the day. Bands of partizans with placards stuck in their hats, and armed with clubs, would parade the streets, and at intervals would shout and chant in Dutch and English, the names of the candidates whose cause they espoused, as— Kruger, Van Dam, Phillipse, Beekman, Morris, und Jacob Delancy. and could not spare time from public matters to attend to the business at present, but would hereafter examine into the affair— or that the law did not exactly provide for the offence; and remedy against such things, in future would be had by application to the next assembly—or in final, that it could not be expected, that his time was to be taken up in listening to every body's malice; that as the person who sought redress for the people was unknown, the whole subject was unworthy of notice, and no indictment could be drawn without a flaw.—But to resume my subject:—as it hath often appeared that a man can see the mote in the eye of his neighbour, much quicker than he can perceive the fault in his own, so it was in this case,—for the Spanish, backed by other friendly powers, made heavy charges to the court at Whitehall, against these frequent aggressions on their property, which were so openly committed by the subjects of a nation then at peace with them, and who pretended to maintain an amicable intercourse and relation, while they were encouraging despoilation; all this appeared to the citizens of New-York, as very unreasonable, and a very impertinent interference in the government of a country, the riches of whose inhabitants they were daily seizing on with the strong hand; whose officers they were accustomed to insult, in the very mouths of their cannon, with impunity; and who, in short, they considered as their prey, from their riches and indolence: and who, owing to circumstances, was then the weakest power; and therefore, without grumbling, it was thought they ought, as marks of regard and deference for the strongest, allow themselves to be drubbed, robbed and bearded. As is customary on occasions of excitement, a self-formed “committee of three,” having all things cut and dried for fear of a mistake in the performance, called a public meeting, in the name of all the citizens, through the medium of the Post-boy,[16] [16] One or two numbers of this antique paper, are still in existence. which was the popular journal of the day; and published by a long necked, lanthorn jawed. Connecticut runaway schoolmaster,† † The people of the east, have certainly been extraordinary votaries of the quill—the oldest newspaper in New-York, the Gazette, was first started by Deacon Lowdon—of Stonington, no doubt—and most of these conveyances of intelligence existing among us, have had their origin from his countrymen; these puritanical adventurers, have pulled the cup from the very lips of our old Dutch families, whose descendants are fast finding the truth of the rythm,—“The folks of the east, have been feasting on geese, And sent the feathers to us.” at the extravagant price of two coppers a number; which sum however, when one takes in mind the talents of the editor, was not out of the way; seeing that once a week he enlightened his readers with an account of the secret plans and the private thoughts of the cabinet of the great Cham of Tartary, whom he honoured by a particular notice, and who it was believed, was then about going to war; and as the writer was also accustomed to cut up and slap at a terrific rate, the policy of the king of the Hottentots, who was very unpopular through these sharp attacks, and no doubt must have felt extremely sore at perusing them. However, the above mentioned “committee of vigilance and public safety,” as they styled themselves in the advertisement, being greatly interested—as probably the characters most in danger should the business become serious,—finding their call well attended, before commencing business, proposed adjourning the assemblage to the fields[17] [17] Also then called the Commons, and was where the City Park now is. The place where the City Hall and Jail are erected was commonly used for the execution of criminals. —which was of course, unanimously carried into effect; and a little man being elbowed on the shoulders of the mob, commenced with a weak and whining note, a very philippic—“the most eloquent specimen of modern oratory,” as was announced by the Post-boy next morning; the editor of which paper, by the by, having received a corrected copy of the speech a week before it was delivered, for publication: the diminutive speaker, after exhausting his lungs, storming against the audacity of the lazy and haughty dons—and to the very top of his voice, calling on each honest man present and absent, to oppose every attempt of governmental proceeding; and concluding with a flowery and glowing description of his own patriotism, and “that he was no friend of tyrants, even before he was born,” sat down exhausted and panting for breath, amid repeated shouts of applause from his audience, very few of whom had heard a word that he had said;—his silence was followed by a long string of resolutions, flaming with determinations which in a week were forgot; but which were all appropriate, being ready made to suit the occasion, and brought in the pocket of a stormy pot-bellied burgher, who read them off in a snuffling tone, puffing and labouring at every word, as if his entrails were coming through his throat—and then all was adjourned by motion in order by the chairman—every body departing “with the greatest regularity and decorum,” not excepting a dozen ragamuffins, who had been busied in emptying the pockets of the attending crowd—and who, together with one or two particular friends, who were the public thief catchers, hand in hand retreated to the neighbouring taverns to divide gains, and determine what would be befitting conduct for the nation in its emergency. However, the very great scandal brought on an English province by this unblushing perseverance in wrong, at last succeeded in bringing the Board of Admiralty, after various delays, to concur in the fitting out of a private armament—the command of which was given to one [18] [18] Kid in his trial, (State Trials, vol. 14) is called William Kid— but Richard being the name by which he is most generally distinguished, as used by Hume, is here adopted. Richard Kid, who had been recommended by an ancestor of the Livingston family, as a man who was well acquainted with the customs, manœuvres and rendezvous of the pirates. But Kid, in setting out on this cruise, was moved by the same motives which guide most of our own brawling bullies, and swearing politicians—self-interest—and therefore soon betrayed his trust; for, like a certain hypocritical time server, who by his shifting, servile and corrupt conduct in office, has become as contemptible as the crawling vermin, whom in his character he resembles, and whose custom it hath been as it were by instinct, to preserve a station which he has Vol. I. 5 for years disgraced—to change his party on the very last day of an election, to that which his shrewd judgment foreboded would be the conqueror—so that, though a dozen principles have had their sway, it hath mattered fittle to him—he was always among the victors. Kid eagerly seized upon the opportunity thus fortuitously thrown in his way, and sought to use the armament and advantage he possessed, in the furtherance of his own purpose,— for having burnt the frigate he commanded, he leagued with the buccaneers; and at the period of the narration, the commencement of which follows, his savage actions and desperate exploits, had filled the country with horror and amazement. To such an alarming extent had grown the terror of his name, that the parts of the province where it was supposed and reported that his lawless crew used to frequent or land, either for the sake of concealing the booty acquired by their robberies, or to carouse after some murderous and successful expedition, were avoided with fear and superstition, by all except his associates, who, however, were numerous; and although even by them he was hated for his barbarity, yet he seldom found want of stores and assistance, when necessitated to put in port: indeed the fear that he inspired, not only pervaded the breasts of those whose callings were to plough the deep and weltering seas, but many far distant, at least in appearance, from his revenge, dared scarcely breathe a threat: encouraged, and hourly emboldened in his unbridled course, the hand of justice was too weak to wield the avenging sword; formidable and unrestrained, his audacious emissaries were spread in every quarter of the coast, and countless were the deeds acted, that would harrow up the soul, and chill the blood's free flowing in the hearer's veins, at the relation: and often when the storm from the north, howled bleak and dismal, and swept from the trackless ocean with mournful voice, and like a funeral dirge sung round the snug cabin of the fisherman, its inmates would fearfully whisper, that the spirits of the murdered had risen from their watery graves, where they had been darkly tombed, to shriek their curses on the pirate; such is ever the idea of man; for there is a secret and natural abhorrence against great crimes, instilled upon our minds from birth, that however prosperous guilt may be for awhile, yet as the terrible and just sentence denounces `blood will have blood,' so a late though a sure punishment, must attend upon the guilty, and their most hidden actions:—thus many believe, but the ways of providence are inscrutable, or how can we account for the evident long during of the rogues of the day? yes, we have seen to all appearance, men raising their fortunes on the tears of the poor, unpunished; every stride they take to wealth, trampling on the hearts of the unfortunate—and like the reckless warrior, in the crowded flight of the vanquished, spurning the prostrate body of his falling comrade, they base the fabric of their prosperity, upon the hopeless ruin and blasted happiness of others; and have we not beheld the iron-hearted landlord go down to the grave, leaving behind unto his offspring a mint of riches, gathered by grinding and extortion?—he hath enjoyed a long life, and ease and luxury—and round his plumed hearse, are marshalled troops of weeping friends—and to his burial place, the mournful pomp of sorrow and respect, accompanies him—while, mark the reverse, the generous noble hearted creature, whose whole soul was charity and friendship for his species, spends his life, even as a lingering death; want, poverty and famine, his companions; and ends it either in the common alms-house, the lazaret or the prison, happy if there be a roof above him, that he die not by the way-side untended and unpitied; and his uncoffined limbs be not cast into some loathsome pit dug for carrion:—the one like several examples now in view, is the great, the good, the worshipped, the every thing, with the world; possessing its confidence and its honours;—and the other is always a poor mad besotted foolish fellow, whose witless brains and extravagant courses in relieving the distressed, and allowing every body to cheat him that pleased, never gave him a chance to gather up a single dollar in his whole life; and who has come to that which it was expected, since he allowed himself to be so sadly shaved by the bro kers, and endorsed for a friend who made it his pride, after getting free by the act, to insult the poverty and misfortune that he had caused.—As is the case just cited, with the prosperous, whose slightest notice is more acceptable than the cordial smile of the thriftless; so, though horror and disgust followed the deeds wherein he gained them, yet the spoils of Kid introduced themselves into the favour, and the purchase of the good burghers of the city; and it is even asserted by tradition, but how veritably one knows not, that at the grand festival of St. Nicholas, which might perhaps assimilate to a twenty-fifth of November dinner of our own modern Corporation, that not only the Chief Scout, but the lordly and substantial burgomasters, and the well fed Schepens of the honest city of Nieuw Amsterdam, or New-York, all appeared arrayed in certain calico morning gowns, which were adorned in lieu of bloemates, with orange trees and singing birds: the which material, had formed part of the cargo of a Spanish galleon which Kid had lately captured, and openly sent into the bay,[19] [19] On the 17th August, 1691, Kid brought a prize in the port of New-York; and the governor and council resolved, that paying the king's tenths and the governor's fifteenths—no other duty to be paid for the prize.—Vid. Council minutes, Secretary of State's office. consigned, as usual in these cases to some respectable trading firm; much in a like manner as our late uncommissioned privateer captures of the ships of a friendly nation; and for which an agent of the original owners had instituted a suit of recovery before the above mentioned Scout, who acted as Judge, together with his other municipal capacities; and as might be expected, the said suit shortly after the aforesaid festival of St. Nicholas, was decided peremptorily against the Spanish merchants: from this, discerning reader, it is evident that the custom is of singular ancient derivation, that the “mayor, aldermen and commonalty” of a certain large city, have, time out of mind, been in the habit of `acceptation,' or receiving presents; which may have a partial reference to the present fashion, of taking a dozen bottles of excellent Madeira from each of the wine venders in the city, before a public dinner; none of which are returned, though the apparent purpose was only to taste them; when it is certain to have the mind made up determinately about the purchase, which must perforce be from a nabob of the same side at the last election, before the arrival of a single flask, or the drawing of a cork; tradition hath, it is understood, for the sake of elucidation, farther related, that ever since the afore cited banquet of St. Nicholas, corporations have fallen greatly in the knack of winking at all rascals, even though they break their own last enactions; provided they can give presents, which are in these days, read offices, or can gratify in any way the least selfish wish of a burgomaster, but `si populus vult decipi decipiatur.' It is said that the country on the borders of the little river, or rather creek, the description of which begins this work, was a favourite haunt of the sea robber, that there he landed after his successful piracies, and that when time or the pursuit of fresh plunder would not permit his lavishing his ill gotten treasures in the accustomed debaucheries on the beach of this stream, and its wild and desolate neighbourhood, with many superstitious ceremonies, he was wont to bury them:—strange are the fearful tales men tell, that to the keeping of infernal spirits were given these mines of hidden riches, and even within a few years past it was whispered abroad that the unearthly guardians, which he had charged with these concealments, by the cruel butchery of a prisoner, wandered still true to their unhallowed task about the spot where his gold lies yet unearthed. In these times, as it becomes apparent, people have to fear nothing more wicked than their own evil minds, the place hath been less regarded, as the other portions of the island are more closely settled; but in the days of the pirate Kid, the sole representative of the famous town of Harlaem in the new world, consisted of one broad long roofed cottage, which indeed, in the consequence of its owner, might have vied with its rival `in den bosch,'—for suiting to its lofty pretensions, though the building was of one story, and the eaves almost kissed the ground, yet the gable ends 5* soared steeply up like a pyramid, and were both ornamented by points or stairs, in the true style of the Keysar Graft, the Harring Vliet, and the Bompies; from the centre of the mansion arose a sort of structure that appeared like a pigeon house, containing one huge long door, used for the reception of goods, and although at the top of the edifice, was the place of transacting business, when the occupant was so inclined—above all, mounted on a sea of lead, sailed a small tin Dutch built boat or schuit, which served the double purpose of a weather cock and a ferry sign,—at least so intended, but the architect who had taken the model of the little vessel from the best in the town of Termunderzyl, at which place he had driven the careful craft of a brick maker, found after its completion that what would do in the winds of Holland was not at all fitted for those of America, for a spanking vexatious broad bottomed figure of one of the Dutch graces, which filled up the poop by way of ornament, with all the obstinacy of the sex, who seem to flourish best when most contradictory, always swung around whenever the wind carried the ship in one direction to that point of the compass which was completely opposite; the sapient clay moulder, to whom the mystery did not explain itself, after having smoked several pipes in profound deliberation on the failure of his plan of telling the wind, felt, however, nowise put out, being possessed of true Dutch mettle and considering himself another Quintin Matsys;[20] [20] A native of Antwerp, who, from a blacksmith, became one of the greatest painters of his time—his monument of iron is still seen in the city of his birth. For the life of this great man, vid. Graham's Lives of the Painters. and therefore with immense sagacity, he determined, that as all the trouble had been taken to make it serve, it was of no use beginning the business over anew, for the spectator, by a very slight reversion, if ingenious enough, could at most periods guess aright, the more easy if a Nederlander, for he could not then be so ignorant of navigation as not to know that his countrymen used both the stern and the bows for the same purpose, and to the same advantage. This saving principle of leaving things remain in the situation they were first designed, whether right or not, seems to be the leading maxim of modern economists, if one might draw the conclusion from a grave body corporate, who, whenever they calculate erroneously, which, by the bye, unless one of their own members is interested, is commonly in their own favour, take certain pains that it shall not be easily remedied: for instance, it is to be remarked, they allotted to themselves an uncommon space of time to repay a certain wrongful assessment, but when they, “in their wisdom,” assess the property of others who individually cannot protract, they do not wait to petition, but will have their demand at once, nolens volens. However, the dwelling whose top was thus tastefully adorned, was, to all appearance, a comfortable domicile, which, as it snugly nestled between two rising hillocks like an egg in the nest, seemed protected from every danger—indeed it bore no resemblance to any tall, gaunt, disproportioned mansion, that now casts its clumsy shadows across the narrow lanes of the city, showing the nature of the owner, who selfishly means to take the jolly face of the sun from the passers by, or to astonish the beholder with his magnificence and aspiring imagination in erecting a wind tower, which generally repays him for his trouble by an assignment to some relation or friend in trust, while he pays the honest carpenter for his labour and plan, by taking the benefit of the two-third sweeping clause, which is receiving a full and fashionable receipt;—? don't look wise reader, you are not here thought of—yet there is a Latin saying very applicable, `qui capit ille facit.' Be all this as it may, the home of Sporus Vanderspeigl, for such was the wordly designation of the occupant of the ferry house, had been the work of years; for it was spread out something like a crab, or its owner's hand, which it hath been truly stated exceeded in the breadth, the length from the wrist to the end of the fingers; but as this tradition comes direct from the wife's side of his family, implicit confidence should not be given to it:— for as Sporus was a little man, he was like a small bottle brimful of spirit tightly corked, and apt at times to make a mighty explosion, or in other words get into a great passion, particularly when his kitchen chimney smoked, which like the contract built chimneys of the present day, was very apt to cut up such capers whenever there was any breeze abroad, and it is said, by whom it is not accurately known, that before he removed from the city of Nieuw Amsterdam, his vrouw having on a windy Monday purchased at the Zmidts Vly,[21] [21] Since called Flymarket. at the extravagant rate of four stuyvers, a fat Kalkoensche hen from a broad mouthed Long Island negro, he was so enraged at her prodigality, that as every honest burgher was used when the goed vrouw went astray, he gently corrected the spendthrift quean with the said Kalkoensche hen; but which fact her relations, after the common fashion of all such meddling persons, flatly deny—vilely reporting that Sporus had basely beat the good woman with his hand; for which atrocious slander the honest and learned Dutch Schepen or Assistant Alderman, who in those days held about the same dignity as those of our own times, being equally as thick headed and consequential—though possessing in addition a kind of authority resembling our police magistracy—ordered, that both the party slandered, and Jan Van Schroper and Derrick Tunesse Snedigher, relations to the aforesaid vrouw Vanderspeigl, the slanderers, should pay fifty schellings to the poor; and further, that Garret Van Hoorn, the `konstabel,' should discharge the costs:—now though no reasonable creature will deny the uprightness and profundity evinced by this decision—and that all parties should be punished for the disturbance of the peace, and wilful annoyance of the calm and quiet of the tranquil province of Nieuw Nederlandt— yet who could suppose that the villanous breath of slander would have dared to whisper that the worthy and immaculate Schepen deposited the mulct in an inner drawer of his lessenaar; and being plagued with a shortness of memory, peculiarly in matters of this kind, he neglected to render in his general monthly return to the vroedschap, the afore-mentioned sum of fifty schellings;—nevertheless, though true, this might have been an accident, for it is now no uncommon thing for a public officer to become a defaulter to a round amount, and then, on account of the hardness of his case, apply to government to let him clear of debt, giving as a reason that he does not know what has become of the money. However, from the transaction just detailed, the patient magistrate acquired the surname of den Springer, or the Hopper, owing to the badness of his eyesight, which forced him to jump over the afore-mentioned item of fifty schellings. In the present instance Sporus seemed determined not to be outdone by any Dutch farmer in the convenience and costliness of his tenement, and he was therefore, while debating the design, extremely particular, slow, and cautious, as all wise Dutchmen are invariably in affairs of moment and emergency; which is no doubt the reason why their ideas are so weighty and profound; for like city feasts—great thoughts are not to be digested in a minute, and, as the adage teaches, Rome was not built in a day; so it might be repeated of the residence of this Hollander —for it cost him four years of smoking, planning, and reflection to begin the structure, two more to lay the foundation, and twice that time ere the first apartment, which was the pronk room, was finished to his liking. Do not consider, expeditious reader, that all this period was spent in projecting and finishing off any thing like the tawdry gingerbread finery of one of the four story barns, which are the unrivalled specimens of the improved architecture of these days—no, Sporus was a man of prudence, and his mind and desires were only bent on obtaining a modest Dutchman's comfort; and indeed though all the materials were of the best, the only extravagance known in the building, and that was the boast and pride of Mynheer's heart, was the monstrous width of the chimney place—whose great mantel piece jutted boldly from the wall like the blackened jaw of some huge and cavernous den, while each side was variegated with neat glazed china tiles, which at the enormous cost of a stuyver a piece, had been imported from the manufactory at Rotterdam; and whereon was delineated in a masterly manner a whole Bible history—the life of the patriarch Joseph and the dreams of Pharaoh, which however were interpreted after the artist's own fashion, for not having an ox as a model at hand, he had, in the frenzy of the moment, by an excusable graphic license, made both lean and fat kine resemble the acute quadruped called the jackass, as near as any other animal in creation, although at the same time he could not have been accused of violating the commandment of Scripture, as it would have been difficult to have ascertained an exact similitude of the creatures figured, in earth, air, or in any other element. As soon as the exterior of the building was completed, Sprous moved bag and baggage into the mansion, and that all his valuables might be secured from spoilers, which commonly appeared in those times in the shapes of thieving Indians or pilfering and wandering pedlars from the New England provinces—who under the name of trading, but in reality for the sake of sharping, inundated the country of the inactive and ease loving Meinheers, elbowing them out of their quiet and cheating them out of their very eyes, much in the same manner as in these latter years have emigrated from the same part those brazen herds of adventurers—most of whom first come begging as itinerant preachers and schoolmasters, without any other qualifications than conceited and assured impudence, ready for any employment that presents, they push themselves in the crowd, jostling on one side honest and better men, (for it is no hard matter for rogues to tread down virtue) and soon they either transform themselves for the sake of novelty as well as bread, to crazy political journalists—characters which certainly are arduous ones, as they want true adepts in slander, untruth, and hypocrisy, places which are to be only filled by such as will lick, dog like, the feet of a rascal in authority, or care not how they bring themselves to be despised, contemned, and disgraced;—or ambitious of a better standing as speculators, they start into the world usurping the desk of the merchant, lacking honour, honesty, and name—without any other capital than the low and despicable cunning of their nature, which is ready ever to seize on petty, dishonourable advantages—without any other credit than an inherent knavery, a quick and palpable tongue, and a lying and specious appearance can obtain for them. Perhaps as much for the sake of comfort and convenience, as that all might be under his own observation, as it is well known there is nothing like the master's looking to what is going on in his house—and as the careful Nederlander did not often desire to extend either his imagination or his exercise he introduced under the same roof and within the same enclosure, most of his moveable property—the principal items consisting of his wife and kind, his negro, his tobacco pipe, his snickersnee, his hogs,[22] [22] The raising of hogs was of some moment, as a fair was instituted by ordinance annually, on the 1st of November,—Records, Sept. 30, 1641. his flask of Hollandts, his goats,† † Goats and goats milk were frequent subjects of traffic about the year 1638, and several years later.—ibid. (in the raising of which animals he hugely delighted,) his `kist' of guilders, together with an old spavined, wind dried blind mare, and a lean, lank, bare ribbed skeleton of a snarling mastiff; for with all the slackness of movement that Vanderspeigl was famous for, he had by some means or other amassed considerable wealth; and as he was too lazy to seek fortune, it really seemed as if the fickle divinity determining that he should not be indifferent about her embraces, had therefore with open arms ran to him, for she appears to have her humours like all females, and the best way oftentimes to obtain her favours is to treat her with indifference, and not to trouble one's head about her; now in this the prudence and foresight of Sporus cannot be too much commemorated; and indeed he was not only worth money, but he knew how to keep it; he was not one of those eager, avaricious hazarders, who anxious to make themselves rich or to add to that which was already an independence, would jeopardise all upon one single chance—leaving their happiness or destruction to the changing of a breeze:—for once, being offered by old Conraedt Goelet, a tight, crabbed dealing Nieuw Amsterdamer—but who was something given to dress, a whole tract of woodland situated in the neighbourhood of Spring Garden and the Holy Ground,[23] [23] This extended from about where Dey-street now is, until beyond the College and Park-place; and being the suburbs, was a spot almost exclusively devoted to dancing and gaming houses, and other rendezvous of the lowest description, and from its character it had obtained in derision the name of the Holy Ground. Such was the ill fame of this portion of the city, that the site of St. Paul's Church was given as a donation in a pious fit of the owner of the soil, whose conscience possibly pricked him with the evil deeds committed on his property, for the purpose of erecting a place of public worship. And it is recorded that the text at its consecration, preached from by the rector, was from Exod. chap. iii. verse 5,— “And he said, Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” in exchange for a beaver hat, whose fashion was the latest worn in the Hague—Vanderspeigl, who well knew he could sell an article of such demand for at least ten stuyvers, could not help wondering at such a foolish idea as that Goelet could suppose he was to be taken in that way—so after hearing patiently all the fine arguments that were used to induce him to close the bargain, he shook his head in a knowing manner, and placing his finger by the side of his nose he only answered “dat Meinheer Goelet dont drick beobles mit hish dalking out vrom dere geldt.” As may be expected from such amazing shrewdness and knowledge of the world, Sporus might have been called in the expressive idiom of the moderns a warm man; and doubtless, had banks been chartered at so early a period, judging by the great and efficient personages of this era concerned in the controlling of such institutions, Meinheer Sporus Vanderspeigl would have been a capital character for the president of one; for as he was a cunning man with all his phlegm, he would have taken precious care to feather his own nest, though the public suffered thereby;—and in truth who are the public, every body?—then surely it is a safe maxim, that being such it cannot feel a loss or injury like an individual; it does not therefore surprise that so many shave the every body for a private advantage; and besides all must perceive the many cannot be harmed by that which is taken to enrich a single person. Still with all that he was blessed, Vanderspeigl had to contend with foul breaths and evil tongues. Never have men congregated together, no matter in how small a portion, but what they have envied each other, and sought to destroy that which they themselves were unworthy of and unable to attain; what I have not, none other shall have, is the maxim under which most act; and whence hath arisen so much sorrow, misery and destruction: scandal, with its cold and blighting wing, freighted with self swoln intelligence, was busy with his fame; and there were whispered hard stories about the guilders that this Dutch owner of Harlaem Ferry had collected in the safe depository of his home—and much was said of a great chest which had been seen in the Hollander's house, and which as reported he watched with unceasing caution; now there was nobody who could tell who had a glimpse of this mystery, or give an account in the least connected—yet all agreed that the chest, whatever was in it or whatever it was—if indeed after all it was a chest—had not been fairly come by; and then the speakers would shrug their shoulders and wofully turn up their eyes in an awful and meaning manner. Thus from the busy brains and quicker mouths of jealous knaves or fools is the peace of even the innocent destroyed; for every communication that harmeth another, is given to all except the object of the rumour— and like the flames from lightning borne that in the dried forest rages swifter than wind, it hurries on, gathering in its blasting flight new vigour—thus are our lives a torment—thus by insidious lies are we pierced to the marrow—and like one stabbed by some coward bravo in the back, we see not the arm that darts the blow, and die unable to avenge—for the victim is the last to know the extent of the calumny:—is not this persecution worse than the sword or the axe? doth it not blast the brain and sear the heart with hopeless misery?—truly it turneth our souls to gall and bitterness, and man becomes companionless, a phantom among his fellows, and moves through life solitary, suspicious, and hating, like a lonely Vol. I. 6 and stormy cloud that blots the visage of a summer heaven. Indeed, many were the mischief-fraught tales told in all the pride of conscious importance by those notable tea-table housewife gossips, whose time is passed in the busy and saving duty of looking after every body's affairs except their own, that were not much to the credit of the honest scouw steerer:—there were dark hints of pirates—of murdered travellers—such as a certain person on a certain gloomy night stopping at the ferry house and asking for a night's lodgings, and the certain person being never seen to depart. Whether it be that sudden accumulation of wealth alone creates envy and desire, or it is engrafted in the very nature of humanity to pluck a hole in the garment of a fellow creature who is not even a stumbling stone in our path of prosperity, cannot be solved; but while Sporus (and such had been the case) could not enumerate more than one pair of `broeks' in his wardrobe, and his home was nothing but a miserable hovel of rude unplaned logs, scantily thatched with bark, whose only aperture besides the low entrance was a small hole in the roof, which admitted faintly the light of the heavens, and afforded a void for the smoke—then there was none who thought him worthy scarce of a passing word, for he was looked upon as one of those wretched outcasts who in the freaks of unpropitious fate had been cast upon this world of wo as a very model of misery—but now the picture was reversed, things were entirely changed, and though the good dames who have been mentioned were never weary behind his back as has been stated, at denouncing him “a gruff, cross creature, who knew more of some things than he should do for his conscience sake,” yet in his presence, no man in the whole island of Manathan was more belarded and beflowered with compliments —the Dutch language itself was wasted and exhausted in culling sentences fruitful in respect, and instead of plain Sporus as it had been, “Mynheer Sporus Vanderspeigl,” and “hoe vaart u Mynheer,” were now the current pass words. Had it been in the present day that this was enacted, Sporus would certainly have stood an excellent chance for being elected a congressman, and probably a governor, for from a natural taciturnity he was much averse to speaking, which would have looked very wise and sapient, and as long as it did not interfere with his own interest, he doubtless would have `drout broper' to vote always as his constituents directed, particularly when on the strongest side, and by this means, placing honour and virtue out of the question, he would have been long able to keep his place, which is now the only aim of a politician—and though one would suppose it no easy matter to humour the whims of the crowd, yet the practice and improvement of the times have reduced it to a simple maxim;—take care of yourself, get all you can, and do all you can for those who elected you; which does not mean the multitude, but a certain intriguing few, the demagogues of caucus[24] [24] I incline indubitably to derivate this word from an ancient source—there seemeth a certain similitude in the sounding thereof unto the Greek a shoe; and of a surety a caucus is the sole of cobbling—for the public candidate who is debarred from caucus nomination, had better have lost his soul. Albeit the method now of fitting on a shoe to the nation is by a caucus government. —T.P. nomination, to whom both the people and their representatives are but tools, and with whom no honest man can thrive. But Mynheer Vanderspeigl was born a philosopher—he heard little and cared less what the world (which expressive word usually includes no more than the circle of one's immediate acquaintances,) said of him—and that which would have fairly turned the brain of another, scarcely disturbed his accustomed quietude, or roused him more than a summer zephyr would the sluggard waters of the Zuyder Zee. Indeed he was a person of experience—early he had left behind him the miserable and comfortless hut, and wandered unpitied away—to what course not even the sharpest guesser could imagine:—time rolled by and had nearly obliterated his memory, for the poor and miserable are soon forgotten—few are the kind remembrancers that recall with pleasure or with pity that they have once been—No! to them the only words that speak their ha ving existed are, “poor fellow, I am glad he is out of his misery;” probably from the very lips that selfishly had hastened the fate they thus commemorate; truly, there are not many who will believe that the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate have as fair a claim to life and the sovereignty which man holds on earth, as the most rich and powerful that breathe the wanton airs of heaven. However, as most strange and extraordinary things have happened, so the eyes of the burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam lightened as it were of a sudden, on a well filled winkel that occupied the upper story or rather garret of the weduwe Yokupminshe Van Schaik's new house, in the pleasant straat called der Mayhden Paetje,[25] [25] Now called Maiden-lane.—Vide MSS. information of Garrit Van Gelder. Hist. Soc. (Library.) or the virgin's path—a street then as now, one of the most fashionable for ladies to saunter in, and spend their money out of mere pastime, under the name of shopping—a word which carries with it the meaning of bargains, gained by a whole day's waste of time—and necessary purchases, which were only necessary for the salesman to get rid of; but besides this for business, the Mayhden Paetje had other advantages, as it was the most public place of resort in the mighty stadt of Nieuw Amsterdam, as the very first young women of the place, after milking the cows on a summer afternoon, walked up its crooked paths for the sake of taking an airing and hearing the love sighed tales of the gallant Mynheers. In the long door of the loft aforesaid on such occasions could be distinguished sundry big-bellied Flemish jars, on which might be plainly read in splendid letters of Dutch mettle the delightful words of der goold water and der zilver water; and there too, enveloped in the smoke of his pipe, might be observed the master of these liquids, the lofty Mynheer Sporus Vanderspeigl, contentedly viewing in the looking-glasses† † Most of the houses in Dutch cities, particularly at Rotterdam, have looking-glasses placed on the outside of the windows on both sides, in order that the inmates may see every thing which passes up and down the streets. on the outside of his dwelling all that passed by—or laughing as he listened to the merry jokes of his buxom landlady. As things moved on, aided by considerable custom and close and economical living, the industrious Nederlandter was enabled to shut up shop; not in the modern fashion by breaking at full credit, and leaving the unfortunate creditors to whistle for their demands, and then setting up a carriage—but in a strait forward strict Dutchman-like manner, paying and being paid; so having closed his affairs and wound up his business, Vanderspeigl (for the heart even though hardened turneth fondly with the affection of a child for its mother, to the green spot of earth whereon in youth we gamboled,) once more hastened to seat himself by the side of his native river, determined to grow fat on Esopus beer, to smoke his pipe in peace, and to cultivate to his heart's content, sun flowers, holly halks and cabbages. But alas! how short sighted are human plans of happiness—how have the most knowing been deceived,—for attracted by the seeming ever cheerful temper of dame Van Schaik—her merry chatting and her gleesome jokes—and then too what Dutchman of susceptibility could behold without emotion the forlorn state in which the weduwe dwelt in her new house of the best Holland brick, without wishing to console her in her loneliness—and then too, to think what an enticing hand she was at pickling cucumbers, smoking red herrings, drying peaches, potting preserves, and tossing slapjacks— and then to behold her neatness as she overlooked the scrubbing of the side walks of her dwelling, and sanded the white floor of the zaal, carefully marking out pretty tasteful Dutch figures on the boards—and then too, to listen to the spiteful jingle of that great bunch of keys that adorned her side, and know of the flask of ancient genever, of precious delft, and of cracked china milk pots, that paraded the ample shelves of the cupboard;—considering these moving circumstances, where is there a man who boasts the least Holland spirit but might be led astray; and is it to be wondered at that wisdom itself was triumphed over by such charms?—but alas, it is useless—a mere waste of time which is fleeting and precious, to sum up any more evils when the understand 6* ing reader is informed, that this miserable little Dutchman was involved in the utmost trouble, with all his riches and contentment—he had taken a wife; so it was—not all the phlegm which the capacious stomach of Vanderspeigl contained was able to keep his rib in subjection, or all the weight and power of his broad hand to allay her “skipping spirit” as the poet terms it:—not even the pride of the burgher's return to his former home—not even the goodly satisfaction of showing to the astonished boors his new and high fashioned garb from Nieuw Amsterdam, which had been cut by Snhyder Ketteltas in the latest mode of the beaux of the Vyverberg fuyten-hoft—no, though his broad and ample leathern broeks might have vied in magnitude with a common sized beer barrel—though his flat shoes bore as sharp a point and glistened and shone with silver buckles, whose broadness and brilliancy were equal to those of the Dominie Van Niewenhyt,[26] [26] The quarrel of this minister and Nicholas Ranslear seems to have made considerable disturbance in the province, and rendered him famous in 1675.—Vide Smith, p. 43. the great pastor at Beverwyck— though in brief his whole appearance bespoke the man of wealth and consequence; whether it was from the fineness of the `goud' that glittered in the large round buttons of his colopeye, which from their hugeness might have rather passed for plates than the necessary loops of wearing apparel—or from the broadness of the brim that decorated the bowl shaped hat that crowned his head— not all these could give him a quiet house, or change his situation one jot from being the most put out, pestered, plagued and hen-pecked Hollander in the whole country. The throne of his happiness was demolished—the very seat of his comfort was destroyed—the strong hold and citadel of his enjoyments were stormed—there gathered no domestic peace about his hearth—but all was strange and cheerless around him. Although, as has been told, Sporus was a man of few words himself, yet he was a great admirer of eloquence in others; indeed he would have made a wonderful jury man, for long speeches acted by way of a soporific on him—and having this quality, he would have served to sleep out the frothy, windy, sounding, and matterless declamations of certain of our modern advocates, who always take care to breathe forth sentences so very fine and poetical that no one can understand them.—Truly, Sporus enjoyed company, an it were only to amuse his eyes; and he had been with exceeding honour to himself, a useful and active member of the ancient association of burghers who were accustomed to meet in the centre of Coentjes Slip, under the wide spreading shade of a lofty button-wood tree, and within sight of Dow Cregier's sign of the Dog's head in the Porridge-pot,[27] [27] This sign is celebrated in an advertisement in the “New-York Weekly Journal,” published by Johannes P. Zenger, 1705, and from the description, must have been at the beginning of Coenties Alley. on a bright and shiny Sunday afternoon; for the purpose of debating and deciding on the aspect of the times, smoking their tobacco, and quaffing wholesome draughts of beer—and had even smoked himself to be one of the first men among them, though he had several doughty rivals to contend with,—in particular, Burgomaster Wyckoof, Mynheir Kipp, and Krygsman Van Zaandt: the first of whom being an echevin, and a heavier man, of course it was natural should have the advantage over him, not only in deep and instinctive views of public matters, but in puffing and blowing—a prerogative of great men; the second was very near his equal in wisdom; but then the last being a tall, straight, fighting character, could beat all hollow at a story, —and easily run a-head in shuffle-board, nine pins, quoits, cock and hens, and dominoes; in all of which games and manly exercises, his descendants have been most wonderfully proficient, owing doubtless to their inheriting his scientific and military attainments. Of all these instructive amusements and improving companions, Vanderspeigl was now deprived; he had never dreamt of their not being an estaminet at Harlæm—and when the first novelty of his landhuis was passed away, and when he had sufficiently admired the fiery visages of his marigolds and the huge jolly faces of his sunflowers, and was somewhat wearied at the scarce ever ceasing music of the bullfrog and the cat-bird, and had become accustomed once again to all such rustic melodies and comforts—he was surprised and awe-struck to find that the shrill and harsh notes of his loving spouse predominated, and kept his ears busy, and his household in a clatter and confusion the whole day long. As is customary with most husbands in his desperate and melancholy situation, he became dogged, sullen, and weary of the combat, in which as he grew fainter, the more severely he was urged by his opponent; and as might be expected from such matters, he shortly gave in to his wife—who was one of those damsels who knew no modesty in triumph, but pushed her conquest to the utmost with a high and tyrant hand. Whether from this or not, it is impossible to ascertain; yet on settling in their neighbourhood, Vanderspeigl on his part avoided the dwellers of East Chester as much as they had formerly shunned him, and though the goed vrouws made frequent attempts at sociability with his dame, yet as she was possessed of one of those save-all dispositions (and which was also in unison with her lord and master, as the world would style him) that characterize many of the hospitable ladies of the present century,—she soon taught them, though with perfect high-dutch politeness, that as she was lineally descended from a hoogduisch family of Amsterdam in the Low Countries, her father having been a skipper on the Amstraccan canal, (and by the by, of this parental dignity she often reminded Mienheer to his cost) she could not condescend to encourage an intimacy with persons, who, if they had been aboard of her father's trekschuit, would scarce have been allowed to look at the roef; and who knew nothing of the accomplished civilities of the beauties who frequent the Cingel; it was soon therefore discovered that neither oley koeks, katrinshe or smoked sausages, were to be feasted on by them at Vanderspeigl's—and this added, in all probability, to sharpen the wits of the disappointed masticators against the insensible ferry owner; as soon after offence had been taken, it was noticed (for when women are determined to find out something ill, they are lynx-eyed, and far beyond the watchfulness of men) that Sporus, with all his guilders, was but a paltry miserly nasty little fellow; and having laid down this broad foundation of character, it became no hard task to raise a more certain structure: nor was the poor man's wife suffered to pass without reputation, for Vrauw Clopper, who was a shrewd knowing woman, and always just in her strictures, thought it hard that he, abused creature, should bear all the blame, when he merely deserved a small portion,—and therefore, to put the saddle on the right horse, she gave the dame of Barent Fonda a morning call,—and in the tide of important converse, she ventured to hint that she was convinced that Sporus, (unfortunate being,) bad as he was, would never have been so outrageously mean, were it not for his helpmate—who without mincing matters—and this the emphatic lady assured her hearers, she did not mind telling the person of whom she was discoursing, to her very teeth; (of which, nevertheless, she took prudent care, as she was no promoter of mischief) that she was a low, spiteful, pride-becrazed wretch—who would one day live to know her betters; for it was a true proverb, that those who ride a high horse, must take care they have not a sad fall. From this situation of things, it is not to be wondered at, that, what otherwise might have been considered a mere whim, was now metamorphosed into a real peccadillo: and it was very earnestly descanted on, that our Dutchman was seldom or ever in the habit of attending his family (though Vrauw Yockupminshie was extremely devout, pious and sincere, and in all spiritual things mightily godly given) either to the neighbouring conventicle of master Baregrace Trebletext, or to the high Hollandsche sermons of Dominie Van Gieson; which he snuffled forth weekly out of a huge and mighty book, bound in parchment splendidly stamped, with thick brass clasps, and other brazen ornaments; the whole of which had been manufactured at Leyden, at the sign of De Ruyter's Head; and which, from its ponderous weight and compactness, was a most awful specimen of antique superiority, and the flimsiness of all modern publications: and it was further reported about this persecuted Nederlander, that when questioned—however, during the absence of his wife,—on those subjects which most pertain to the good opinion of the world, (though you be a great rogue otherwise) charity in public and church going, that he would ruefully, at the interruption, take his long pipe from his mouth, and after deliberately clearing his throat and puffing away the smoke from his nose, which rose in volumes from his lungs, would answer with rapidity; for as has been related, he was prone to slowness in action, and by no means garrulous, yet he delivered quickly whatever few words he chose to honour his hearers with. “Mein got—got tam!—would u hab ik von breacher? Ik vill hab none of dien zottigheid—dien nonzensh—de breaching be vrouws wark—vivers wark— op myn ziel! Ik hab der vrouws breaching t'huis van den ogtend tot den avond—got tam! vrom der buttoning ob myn broek dill myn eysh are closhd—mein got!” It is perhaps less to be wondered at, from the forced solitude of his life, and that, as must be perceived, he was withal, much addicted to the unrighteous vice of interlarding his conversation with divers metaphors and vivid illustrations, which the gued wives set down as rank staring oaths, these numerous, disagreeable, disadvantageous and tough rumours, remained uncontradicted in circulation; nor was Sporus a person disposed to stop their progress; for they were of no moment to him; they neither sickened him, nor took away his daily food: he consumed his allowance with as hearty a stomach, as though no one troubled themselves about him: and he could shrug his shoulders with all people's talking: still he had sufficient to employ the brief space, he exercised his mind and his tongue at home, with a stirring wife and a thriving farm: for while the former filled his house with a whole short-legged tribe of chubby clumsy Dutch urchins, with bright and pleasure dancing eyes and rosy cheeks, that vied with the cherry ere it burst in its summer ripeness, and who with their loud and cheerful halloos as they sportive gambolled round his hearth with hose scarce gartered, drove away the little silence that their `moeders taal' might be pleased to allow him; the latter ever greeted his sight with increasing stores; on his domain, the sweet sad warbling of the reaper's voice, floated through long fields fresh and beautiful with luxuriant ripeness: here the tender buckwheat's gay and snowy fruit, shook to the gentle southern breeze, like the white tops of a turbaned host; there the yellow beard of the Indian corn, glistened to the sun like threads of brightest amber, or sparkling nets of gold that form the silk-worm's summer palace, and many a gallant drake gave amorous call to his speckled mate on the blue waters that softly glided in the front of his cheerful mansion, and though `silently across the aspect of terrestrial things, a chilling change had pennoned its wide flight,' and the hoarse winds raved, and the clouds hung heavy o'er the unsheltered earth, while the cold winter's ice covered his grounds, and the white snow piled itself before his door; yet rich stores of grain filled his ample barns, and within his dwelling the crackling log sent forth its life sustaining warmth; season after season, seemed merely to revolve within the circle of unending time—adding to his coffers and extending his comforts: could then unhappiness disturb him? day followed day to him with scarce a change; he possessed all; that all wherein is comprised the ideal contentment and enjoyment of this world—wealth!—no matter how gained, how accumulated—it is still “the high imperial type of this earth's glory;” and he that hath its sway, as is daily proved beyond contradiction, holds a shield invulnerable; against whose brazen breast, the breath of fame, the giant strength of justice, equal with the poisoned dart of envy, wither hurtless as a reed slung by the arm of infancy:—but by this time, the reader must be impatient for a more intimate acquaintance with the Hollander, than mere description; he must therefore be referred to the succeeding section, with which the story whereon this history treats, is more properly commenced. SECTION II. `We are bold and brave,' the pirate said, `Our fame is known afar; `We've plundered on the southland, robb'd on the sea; `Our barks have ploughed the dark waved Caribbee, `Our wills our only law; `For we are as free as the red salvage, `In the wilds of America.' Myles Couper. THE BEGINNING OF A STRANGE STORY. It was late in the fall of the year; the gloomy shades of night were fast approaching, rendered darker by the impending tempest; the wind howled low and mournfully through the dried and ice fringed branches of the trees; and as it shook their bare and unclad arms, it seemed to moan like a wailing spirit, that is restless with the knowledge of coming evil: the wild forest wore a cheerless livery, and where a lonely sallow leaf hung quivering on the drooping spray, the last of its once green brotherhood, it clung faintly and fearfully to its hold, as an aged man to life, when all his friends are gone; a melancholy emblem of the changes of the earth— speaking how passing is the pomp and vanity of all created things: the waves of the usually quiet creek were agitated, and drove sullenly on, dashing heavily and roughly against the beach, crested with clear and sparkling coronets of foam, that gathered on their tossing heads like white flowers upon a dark and trembling bush; here and there the brown backed tortoise showed himself on the waters as he swam along—while the white mews, with wailing shriek, on slow pinions dropt downward to the sea, and the long winged wild duck hied to its oozy nest amid the sedge, whose lank spears sank beneath the flowings of the breaking waves; detached masses of dense and misty clouds, chased each other along the still and stirless heavens, seeming like the fearless bands of a mighty army gathering to the conflict; and now and then a white and straggling snow-drop, as pure as its home, fell languidly through the air—a token of the coming drift: the sun, as is in northern climates, long ere the joining of night and day, could be scarcely traced on the stormy horizon, except by a sickly circlet of dim and ghastly light, that at intervals broke through the thick haze and rolling clouds, that covered the blackened visage of the lowering sky: from the depth of the brake, was heard the hideous howlings of the wolf, who, frightened, sought his den; and the piteous cries of the tameless and prowling panther, swelled the passing blast: the lithe brambles of the tangled copse and the deep hedge, were verdureless; and shook in the nakedness of their desolation: while their seared and decaying fruitage, lay stricken on the dried earth, silent and deserted—sad memorials of the departed beauties, and the loneliness of nature. Yet on the hill side the strait and lordly pine towered upwards, its green boughs beprankt with foliage dark—as hung with votive wreaths by some sylvan worshipper, flourishing in bloom amid the cheerless and desolate scene, like the spirit of the good, which neither misfortune, sickness nor poverty, can bend,—while around was the season of man's decay, when all of hope hath fled and perished, and every thought and prospect of futurity, are frowning and bleak with storms. Upon the ground in front of the ferry house, a large chesnut lay outstretched like some fallen giant, torn up by its massive roots, the victim of some late and appalling hurricane. Its branches, which had once shot their blossomed spires of silver upwards, and within the arbour of whose pleasant shade, whole flights of summer birds had nestled, were now crushed and broken: and the countless foliage that had decked them in the hour of pride and majesty, lacerated, torn and dank with rottenness, were strewed in decayed heaps about the scathed tree, or were driven to dust by the unsparing wind along Vol. I. 7 the uneven beach:—composedly seated on the trunk of this o'erthrown pillar of the wilderness, and contented as though he had been a burgomaster, while drawing the essence of the tobacco which he was smoking from his pipe, was placed the lordly Mynheer Sporus Vanderspeigl; gazing with vacant eye at times on the heavy aspect of the clouds, and on the labours of a stirring, sturdy, grey wooled negro; whom it is proper to introduce to the reader by the nominal of Yonne, or rather without disparagement, Mynheer Yonne Vanderspeigl: by which sounding designations, he modestly chose to be addressed. Now as names have become mere optional matters in latter years, wanting neither law nor estate, to be changed or modelled as the user chooses to wear them; for a different address is often a passport to credit—and an advantageous cover, under whose disguise a foreign vagabond adventurer, and escaped convict, may pretend to the part of an honest man: therefore Yonne's right to these innocent additions, was beyond question; the more so, as the only sinister design apparent in their adoption, was a little pride—excusable, since now the rage for a great appellation, is much more ridiculous than it was in the simple black: and though there is known of no existing kindredship between Yonne and his proprietor—and to which, were it not that modern example and philosophy had exploded all doctrines that could be advanced, in an insuperable difference of complexion, feature and race, one might be inclined to suppose, from this bearing of title;—yet nevertheless, he had more right to a respectable surname, than nine out of ten of our great men have, to that of honesty; or one of a thousand of our cheating, shallow-brained, purse-proud, would-be nabobs, to that of gentlemen. Indeed Yonne was the right hand man of his master; his confidant—his ever ready assistant and adviser in all business of importance: garrulous in consultation, and active in execution, he was, in truth, after Ya Vrouw, the person of most consequence on the Nederlander's domain; and with all his Dutch breeding, one could not look without a deal of satisfaction upon his open, good humoured visage; for though he could not be estimated as having an uncommon share of beauty in his dark countenance—for his eyes, which were of extraordinary magnitude, and bolted out from the sockets like the same organs in the head of a beetle, appeared but as huge white orbs, owing to his rolling the balls under their lids;—his nose likewise, an admirer of correct proportion, might not have considered fit for a model—it being extremely flat and large at the nostrils; though to make amends for a broad red under lip, that like a jutting cliff o'erhung his chin—his huge mouth, which was always widened by a grin, discovered a row of teeth white as milk itself; added to these advantages, his cheeks were decorated by sundry scars and seams, and his ears hung with a pair of copper rings, which as ornaments, he greatly prized: and though the fastidious might have deemed his outward man unprepossessing, yet he owned that simple purity of heart—that virtuous truth of soul, that rendered him worthy of every trust with which he was encharged; and Vanderspeigl gave him sufficient to do, and keep his blood stirring; for while the Hollander took his ease and rested from an hour's labour—an exertion that required for the heavy moulded Dutchman on an average, ten hours out of twelve, of inaction and recovery of wind—and oftentimes a day to come to his proper stamina, Yonne, during such lapses of time, was the very game-cock of the fields—bustling in the cabbage garden, and strutting among the Holland pinks and tulips, with all the dimensions of a monarch; for while the mistress made matters stir within doors, he pushed things on merrily without; delving, weeding, and driving away the crows from the corn—or making the shores of the creek resound with his loud and hearty laugh, as he joked the traveller or the pedlar, while he schouwed him across the rivulet; for Yonne's nature was as comely as his heart—mirthful as kind, in disposition: he was unlike the servants of these times, who ape in vice their superiors; for while the latter pilfer in the way of business, the former follow the example, by trying it on their masters: he was of a different species—and that now rarely to be found; he had foibles, but they were of the cast that wronged none; he was a faithful creature, and could it be otherwise? he had been bred up with his master; the companion of his youth, he had for sixty years fed from the same table and dish, and had slept under the same roof:—in a word, he had wintered and summered from infancy to age, in the same family—and in them his being was wrapt up: the name of ingratitude to him, was strange; though now, a word more acted on, than any in the language: he never dreamt of stinging the bosom that fostered him; proud to be the dependant, of his owner, and almost equal by treatment, he went cheerfully to his duty—and all prospered under his assiduous hand during the day; and when the dusky night closed his task, ere he sought his little loft, which was on a level with the swallow coops that were fastened on the ferry-house wall, he would take his accustomed seat on the well worn log that filled one corner of the huge fire place—and while basking in the genial warmth of his situation he would make the roof ring with his glee; as, to the wondering urchins who regardless of his colour, clung about his knees and neck, he would relate the traditions of his mother, who had been brought from the gold coast in a ship belonging to the Holland West India Company—and which had been consigned to Guysbert Myndero, of Nieuw Amsterdam: and at times, for the further amusement of his infantine audience, he would to the sonorous chords of a crack-stringed violin— from which, with much grimace and many laborious scrapings, he succeeded in producing a species of melody that might alone be compared with the soft tones extracted from the filing of a handsaw—blithely troll some rude song. part English, part Dutch, and part African, that would set all his hearers in a titter of delight. Besides this, Yonne had many other powers of sociability— he was the gazette of the whole country round; and the honest Dutch neighbourhood, when any subject was abroad, was always sure to hear the relation through the medium of his tongue: there was not a wedding in embryo—an old witch to be burnt—or a pirate to be gibbeted, but what he was the person best informed on every matter concerning them: his brain was truly a chronicle of recorded experience; stored with tales of ghosts, Indian massacres, spukes and wood demons innumerable: he could tell whole histories of the devil's dans kammer and the Hellegat—and never was there a winding sheet curled in the lamp, or a stranger who had fallen from the burning embers of the cheerful hearth, but they were construed aright by the divining black;— he was therefore, in high favour and credit with the goed vrouw, particularly as he had foretold that the day was to come when she would ride in a coach drawn by four long switch tailed mares, which were to come from Coeymans—and should yet live to carry her head as high as the governor's lady herself; and it was a matter of course, that his wife's favourite, was in this case equally Mynheer's; and in indulging the whimsies of Yonne, was one of the rare matters on which they agreed. Yonne, at the period herein deseribed, under the immediate superintendance of Vanderspeigl, was busily engaged in scraping and overhauling the bottom of the schouw in which he daily laboured, ere it was laid up for the winter; near him, bubbling over a brisk flame which had been kindled from the dry brush wood that lay around, stood an iron pot, heating with tar, from which he was busied in filling the gaping chinks of the boat, though now and then he would pause in his occupation to address some passing word to his master, who, taken up with the arduous task of smoking and thinking, would merely assent to his words by a slow motion of the head; or, as he felt the increase of the cold, and the nearer approach of the tempest, with a quick jerk of the pipe from his mouth, and a shrug of the shoulder, he would bid the black hasten his work. “Me tink him birate be a berry bad man,” said Yonne, as he stirred the boiling liquid and addressed Sporus in one of the intervening conversations, which were occasioned by some necessary hindrance of his pursuit, “Massa Boomelhyser say him kill neegur man to gard him goold—der brute! him hab no bowel—tink neegur man hab no feelin—him blood no run ven him hurt nuder,”—then apostrophizing his work, he continued, “ter 7* debbil dake a nail—him plit ter schouw clebber, sartain —him rotten ting Massa Sporus—vat you tink Massa Boomelheyser 'pose him no stand noder rack—me neder sartain;—den to tink dem debbils dreat negur man so— him no cristin cretur; bad as dem ingin beasts—sartain him all hang some dime a noder.” “Ja! Ja!” drawled out his half dozing auditor, between long intervals of heavy breathing and puffing, “mein Got! der ish der sensh in dein woord, ash vat ish in der spraken von der groodt Stadhouder, op myn ziel—ja! ja! Dou betwisten ash broper ash der Burgomaster in der raadkamer, dat ish, der gounshil der Nieuw Amsterdam—mien Got! ja! ja, Yonne! ja!” The black's visage lighted instantly up with a smile of satisfaction at this high encomium, in having the sense of his words compared to the profound reason that actuates the speeches of their heerships, the lords of the city in council assembled,—that showed the double fence of ivory which guarded his mouth from ear to ear; and it is understood, from the chronicles extant of the enlightened era which is here treated of, and which in most things resembled the present improved times, that Vanderspeigl's discrimination in the matter was extremely accurate; for it appears that their mightinesses, like our own puissant aldermen, were much addicted to silence in city affairs, and only spoke sensibly and interestingly at large, before voting on giving a contract or bestowing an office, and it has also been made certain by deep research, that as the present test on taking a place under government, municipal or national, is to make what you can out of it—so the ancient burgomaster took the oath of allegiance, by swearing “to maintain the reformed religion in conformity to the word of God, and the decree of the Synod of Dordrecht,”[28] [28] Vid. the oath taken by a Schepen and other officers.—Council Minutes. and in other matters to promote public good, whilst it served his own purposes. However, it is but just to these by-gone dignitaries that their histories should not be wrongly inserted, for the former part of the test was that which they spoke with a loud voice, while the latter was a mental reservation, and like all mental determinations, was kept strictly to the letter; but perhaps it is erroneous thus to hazard remarks on persons of such heavy heads and stations, whether living or dead, for the inditer is innocent and unlearned as to what is proper in such great and profound characters, whose dignity is in reality sublime, and this, though well-meaning, might be construed into scandal, and as it hath been demonstrated, there is but small change of sentiment or power among them from former days, he might be forced to suffer the ancient punishment of the wooden horse[29] [29] In Dec. 9th, 1638, two soldiers were condemned to sit two hours on the wooden horse.—Records of Nieuw Nederlandts. The wooden horse, it appears, was a military punishment in general, though sometimes a civil one, and was often used in Holland and her dependencies. It consisted of a large wooden horse, ten or twelve feet high, with a very sharp back; the culprit's legs were fastened with a chain to an iron stirrup, and sometimes a weight was affixed to the feet. The editors of the city, are men of taste, science, and the Lord knows what not; they have set the ladies crazy with riding, which, it must be admitted, most of them do in a very masculine manner, being always prepared, and having no fear of falling, leaving that for the spectator; now it only wants their recommendation to have this animal revived, and become a complete fashion, and as the Sicilian tyrant was fain to have the inventor of the famous brazen bull make the first trial of its efficacy, so our Corporation would do a favour and a benefit to the public at large, to allow the encouragers the first mounting: there are Colonels, Lieut. Colonels, and Majors among them, plenty of officers though no soldiers, and as it is known they all want courage, a wooden horse would be more safe than a live one, particularly as the horse and its riders' faculties would assimilate, being all of wood.—Note from an original Essay transcribed by the Pr. Dev. ; or like Jan Hobbes, the early Dutch satirist, who had the audacity to write a classic hollandsche distich, by way of compliment to one Burgomaster Ezel-een Mensch, who sold lumber near the Webber's Kreek,† † This was towards Corlears Hoek: wherein he stated in verse that would have become a Johannes Secundus, that when Ezel-een's yard was empty, (to wit of lumber,) his head was full, and that the thickest block he possessed, was his own skull, which Hobbes writes kop, in the original; this, however unfortunately, Echevin Mensch did not altogether rightly understand, for he was a strong stomached Dutchman, and rather hard of digestion, owing doubtless to his extreme ignorance and his not having studied the learned Dutch authors, for it is reported, that when he was a child, being more lacking in sense than children are in common, he used to run without broeks and play with the hogs, and from these animals his manners being formed, the term `hoggish,' in stating a man's perfections, hath arisen, and was first applied to this renowned burgomaster; who, from these causes, was utterly unable to take and relish the delicate allusion to his business and his mind, contained in Jan Hobbes' poetry, and he therefore commanded his two Schepens, before whom, as he himself was an interested person, the cause came on to be tried, to order that the said Jan, his guilt not clearly appearing in evidence, should be punished that a confession might be extorted from him by torture; therefore the presumptive satirist was sentenced, to allay the irritated and delicate feelings of the burgomaster, to pay four stuyvers, when it was known he was not worth a groat, and also to stand in the rasphouse door at the ringing of the bell, and humbly and contritely beseech the magnanimous Ezel-een Mensch's pardon.[30] [30] Vid. Dutch Records. “Me sure Massa Burgher,” continued Yonne, presuming on the applause he had received, and anxious to prolong the discourse, “me sure him do him bowel mush good did him kill dem birates dere—den be so berry tankerous wid poor negur man, sartain—ony tink, Massa Roperdauser lick Primus, vat lib wid him, till he kill der neegur,† † Ibid. and den him money, him goold, bring him off; no, dey no hang rich white burgher at Nieuw Amsterdam, ony poor neegur, sartain.” From the conclusion of the black's speech, it will be perceived that he was no mean observer of the course pursued towards criminals in the province, and it may be fairly deduced from his words that there is not a great alteration in our own era, for now probably, even more than the period spoken of in this volume, riches have their influence—gold in the hands of any man is the strongest passport that can be held;—if even a murder is committed, juries are tampered with by those whose situation as public officers demands that they should prosecute. —Judges themselves become but mere tools of corruption —and should even the public outcry call for a condemnation, so rank the crime, that not even premeditated and artful delays will serve, and should the solemn mockery of trial be gone through—what is it all—a farce! Go hunt the prisons; they are filled with wretched losels, beggars, who had not wherewithal to bribe, or whose crimes were forced upon them by mere want, by bitter misfortune and accident—these have no friends, but wear away their lives in sad and solitary wo, while he who was unfit to breathe the free air, whose black heart swelled with wickedness, hath been set at large; his wealth hath loosened the chain—he crossed the threshold of the dungeon door, but his pardon was in his pocket. Think not from what here hath been set forth, that this is but the fevered railing of one disgusted by petty wrongs, and who gazes on all things with a jaundiced eye, making mountains from sand hills—far from it: there is not a word in this paragraph, to prove which, examples are not easy to be pointed out—they need not far to be gone for —they are even at hand. “Ja! ja! Yonne! dou sbeaks mit der menschlyke natuur—op myn ziel, dou dalks ash goot ash dosh der dominie,—mien Got! vat a neger!” said the smoking Vanderspeigl in answer to his slave, blowing with the labour of utterance, and the unaccustomed exercise of his jaws, “Got tam, der storm ish come vroom der Spyt den duyvel, ash it would plow myn ziel out—myn Got,” he continued somewhat more briskly, as with unusual haste he doubled his jerkin across his body, “myn Got! de wind waart hard—Yonne, mensch haast—Got tam de ding will dake you all night, op myn ziel.” “Lor a mitetee, vy you crumple Massa,” returned the negro pettishly, “some dime one ting, some dime nuder,” added he, muttering sullenly to himself with the freedom of a favourite servant checked in this indulgence of his career—“habbe no peace; der debbil, me workee, workee, no tanks neder, sartain”—then turning sulkily to the boat, as is the natural resource of most in fault, he sought to vent his spleen on a new object—“den tink me patch dis old schouw—dam him tar, de neegur—him plack snoot no run in him hole, him berry cantagus—tink wid me no loose him dime mend dis old schouw—dam him imperance—ony tink!” But it was not in the nature of the garrulous and even tempered African to remain long put out or displeased with any body or thing, for having quickly discharged the momentary bile in these ejaculations which Sporus's admonition had called forth, he shortly turned again to his testy companion, and with a complaisant grin, sought to join in his anticipations of a tempestuous night. “Massa Boomelhyser,” said he, for it seemed this important personage was a favorite oracle and undisputed authority with him on all subjects and occasions, “tell me dis morning him hab no doubt it snow 'fore night like him berry debbil, sartain, him corn gib him clebber trouble—sure sign ven man's toe itch dere someting come— Massa Boomelhyser no 'staken—him berry clebber man.” “Ja! Ja!” growled the Mynheer, whose crabbedness was rather increased as he felt the air grow sharper with cold, and feeling somewhat worried at having the tranquillity of his mind disturbed by his attention being called to listen to Yonne's ill-timed address—“mien Got! dien clipper klapper, dien taal, dosh as moosch wark ash dien hand, dou art ash bad ash der vrouw. Goot Got,” he continued, puffing clouds of smoke from his mouth, and blowing like a swimmer between every three or four words, “der sneuw ish naa by, op myn ziel, dou praater mak haast; ich mun smoke mien byp mit beace, so holdsch dien tam blaffing, negur.” The black well knew the sudden changes of his owner's humour, and therefore forbore answering him, but grumbling sourly, in a few half whispered and unintelligible sentences, expressive of discontent, he proceeded to apply himself solely to his work, which soon rapidly progressed, and the ringings of his busy hammer were loudly and oftentimes repeated; yet Yonne's thoughts were not engaged with his labours—he had been barred in the very moment he was entering on the relation of an important subject; in truth he was swelling with news, and he felt like some talkative gossip who receives an offence at the opening of her budget, and though provoked to silence, wants but a word's concession to loosen the strings of the whole communication, and at last fearful of receiving no encouragement or hearing, of her own will, details her story, amply and at large, as it were out of mere wantoness; and thus it was, that not even the long drawn puffs, the half closed eyes, and the nodding head of the nederlander, which bespoke, that in spite of the weather and of care, he was making himself as easy and comfortable as any Dutchman could be in his situation, were able to deter the slave, brimful of his subject and unmindful of his late repulse, from again breaking on Vanderspeigl's quietude. * * * * * But ere proceeding with the narration, (and indeed the matter grows out of Yonne's situation,) it seems as if it ought to be remarked, that though it is certain all are greedy, selfish, and avaricious, without generosity in most matters, so that it may be fairly supposed that it is a principle of civilized society that any thing bearing a value obtained by one should be denied another by the very hand that hath been gifted, yet in some affairs of moment and import there is an unbounded and liberal feeling, and the first among these that is given without a seeking or a demand of return, is the fame of the day, the current of passing intelligence, the reports and rumours, which are the existence and the moving breath of the crowd, that flies from mouth to mouth swift as a signal on the mountain; for in truth, it is seldom but what the person who hath received aught that he deems interesting or strange, is anxious that others should share his wonderment, and he is no more to be obstructed in his intention, though met by coldness and even frowns, than the swollen linn, that dashing down its rude and worn channel in the face of the hill, is to be changed or dammed up from its irresistible and brawling journey by the splintered shrubs and shattered pieces of rocks that it hath washed in its way, or that hath been cast from the overhanging cliffs to impede its passage; truly the earth is overstocked with beings of this species, ever active newsmongers, who would scarce be known to have stirred in an honourable action, but are still of so free spirited a disposition that their whole business is to fetch and carry information—if in the heat of argument an irritable word falls from one, they are sure to let it be known to whom it may concern; not as truly spoken, but larded with their own conclusions, and then when the hearer hath expressed himself in return, all is brought back to the original speaker, and after that it becomes their part to let the world into the secret; surely the idea of these disgusting insects, whose brains are thus stored, and whose venomous tongues are thus urged to activity, calls in view the flight of a busy, buzzing blue-bottle, who sounds his wings with great noise and beats actively against the window pane without impression, but yet though insignificant, is troublesome; for however contemptible are these constant bearing and ever talkative gentry, so slight is public belief and confidence, that many times their adsurdities thrust them into consideration, for the bustle and appearance they assume are apt to deceive, and are calculated to impose on the ignorant and unreflecting, who contribute largely in the formation of the crowd: for the surface is that which soonest attracts the eye, and there the lightest air blown bubble always swims —that this is true must be obvious, for it is not to be supposed, that the possession of great abilities, so often as a moving, noisy nature, aided by the influence of accident, have brought men forward or lifted them from a lowly sphere; it has happened that many a hollow but strong lunged blockhead hath been thrown in a place of consequence, for the world goes to great lengths when once it sets out, and when once a man is raised a step above his fellows, he is pushed up in spite of his own dullness to the very top of the ladder, and while so exalted, the adoration of a blinded mob, (for there is no reasoning with a popular rage, however ridiculous,) even though his baseness be as vivid as light, it is in vain to deny him talents and acquirements, as stragglers from the opinion of the great mass and herd, the world, are sure to be considered envious or foolish; indeed, in many instances, the same thing that calls attention to a village bellman, raises to notice a beer house politician, or whence are public trusts held so commonly by characters of the meanest and lowest description, if not that they bully themselves to power, or that designing men, believing them from their hot, senseless, and unquiet spirits, fit puppets to gratify their private malice, intrigue, ambition, or avarice,—for who is more capable of wallowing in dirt and filth than those who have been bred amidst them,—have helped them to authority and power, which their vulgarity and ignorance render contemptible as well as disgraced: and there cannot be a more singular difference than in the conduct and bearing of these hour raised mongrels while mixing in the common duties of life with their equals, and while robed in the insolence of the functions of their ill borne greatness: in the one, they are on the level with their kind, bending to their constituents and fawning and cringing to their superiors; in the other, swelled and conceited with ideas of their own vast importance; they are haughty to those above them, and overbearing to those below them; dressing themselves in all the vulgar airs of affected greatness, acting a part to which hitherto they have been unknown; they almost conceive themselves of a higher class and finer mould than the rest of mankind, but having neither opinions, thoughts, or actions that are their own, moving without reason, method, or sense, they soon are made the mere jests and tools of the wary; but what else could be expected? If you place a butcher in a legislative hall to make your laws, doth he not partake of the stupidity of a bull? If you take a potter from his jars and jugs, and set him to enact statutes, will they not be as empty as his ware? Drag a hatter from his line of business, is not his skull as hollow as his work ere it is used? a mason's brains are, in government, as hard as the brick he was born to lay; and a publican, though he may be able to guard his till, and measure out drams, knows but little of finance or public measures, except what he might have gathered from tap room knowledge and wit. How Vol. I. 8 far nobler would it be, were men more diffident, did they not endeavour to make themselves ridiculous by aiming at stations for which they are unfit, but keep to those which were allotted them by education; were this the case there would be a lack of that host with which we are now over-run, barefaced and insolent upstarts, who, without foundation, pretend to every thing. To the conceited greatness and impudent self-filled consequence of such, the Records of Nieuw Nederlandts present an excellent lesson in the humility and condescension of that worthy ancient, Whamuldus Schermerhorne, of Schenectadie, who being preferred to the trust worthy and dignified situation of dog whipper for that famous city, attended Dominie Meir's lecture the Sunday after his exaltation without any feeling of pride or elation, which he modestly, as he entered the kerk, evinced, for as he waddled towards his pew under the pulpit, at the commencement of a solemn portion of the dominie's service, to unite with which, the pious Dutch congregation had arisen from their seats, and by which motion, the sapient Schermerhorne understood they were paying respect to him; yet nothing puffed up by this mistake, which might have raised the head of any man, the worthy Hollander, bowing humbly and with profound lowliness, so that his nose almost touched the ground, an exertion in so fat a man of no ordinary kind, exclaimed in a loud voice that all might have the benefit of his words—“By myn ziel, dish ish doo musch, Ik ish nien lift up mit mien brosberity—Ik ish but a man;” so were the persons just written of, to remember they were but men, and what kind of men they had been; it would be much more creditable to their modesty as well as sense. Hiatus in MSS. And now having concluded to my own satisfaction this important theme, the necessity of entering on which, easily excuses its length, and the propriety of which I leave entirely to the judgment of the reader, who, I have already found, a most gentle, courteous, and candid personage, I will straightway and with great alacrity go back to where we first set out, if he so desire it, and will accompany me thither; for indeed our friend Yonne's words have been a long while on the end of his tongue, and the poor fellow has been bursting to speak could he have found an opportunity, but as no one has been in a hurry to hear him, I have not cared much to attend to his discourse; yet as some one or the other will take up this volume, to whom the state of disposition and opinions laid down, will not give a moment's concern, but whose whole heart will be placed on the unravelling of the important tradition with which this section began, and as I am a very obliging author, always minding the admonitions or wishes of the peruser, I am minded to let all the odds and ends of matters for a time take care of themselves, and once more journey towards the pith and marrow of the business in right earnest, on which account an attentive application is recommended to all that follows. SECTION II.—Pursued. “Him no hear vat Massa Boomelhyser tell 'bout ven him come vrom Massa Piet Bogert's dis tay,” said Yonne aloud, as if to himself, yet in a way to awaken his master's curiosity, and rolling at the same time his large eyes on one side, so that he might note the effect of what he spoke on the dormant faculties of the lazy Hollander, “ony tink, him hear Snippitee Waldron tell dat him hear Brom Schenck tell him hear dat Dominie Vermilye's neegur, Crippiltee Cuff, vat goes clamming, tell him Massa dat— Loramitee, ony tink, Massa Sporus, how him sleep,” cried the slave, abruptly breaking the connexion of his communication at beholding Vanderspeigl gave no heed to what he said, except by a kind of half snore or snort, which appeared to intimate that he was more asleep than awake, “catch him det a cold, sartain—him no hear, Massa Boomelhyser tink ter ting true—dem debbil birate back agin wid him ugly face, ony tink Massa,” pursued he, perceiving Sporus moving and listening, “ony tink now, him imperance; him ship in ter sound, Cuff see ur big gun as clebber as him see me—'spose him here vor sum mischief or noder—las dime him here, him teel Gerard Beekman's cows—take all him lay him tam hans 'top—der tief.” It is not a slight thing that will stir a man of equanimity, and of the placid temperament of the ferry master; but nevertheless, the tighter the cork be driven in, and the slower it yields to the screw, the more wind, spirit, and fire when it once comes from the neck of the flask, may be expected from the liquor; therefore, he that is slow to anger, when once aroused, is sure to be more fierce than one who blazes at every spark, catching like tinder; so though the bosom of man may seem impervious to the slightest emotion, yet there are times when some chord being stirred, we are surprised that the feelings are so acute and quick, having heretofore beheld nothing but a strange indifference; but that string when moved must be a home one—that which winds about the heart itself. Whether the last was the cause in this case, or that Vanderspeigl had a mind to circulate his blood, and give a specimen of his activity, it is difficult to determine, but he had scarce heard Yonne's intelligence through, ere, with singular velocity, his eyes started wide open, and his hand, with equal despatch, snatched the pipe from his mouth, which naturally from the movement of the muscles of his face, was left full ajar,—or what may be more probable, in his haste of action, it being a minor thing, he had neglected to close it, not (forgetting however, at the same time, to make a gulp and swallow down suddenly the smoke which might have remained in his jaws,) while, with astonishing rapidity, considering the mould, he raised that inert and ponderous load, his body, on the support of his legs; indeed, the whole pantomime was in the true stage style, and would have called down applause from all judges, who are now-a-days lamplighters, editors, scene-shifters, and all other blackguards, hired by managers to force on an audience lascivious spectacles and bawdy dialogues: it is incumbent, however, to mention that the facility of enactment just described, it is probable, might have been inherited by Sporus from his `grootvader,' who was a stage sweeper at Saardam, to one Van Worst, a great fat, greasy, gin-swelled, duck-legged, beastly knave, who kept a beer byt or bear garden, for the amusement of the rabble.—“Mien Got!—Got tam,” cried he, speaking quickly with the peculiar emphasis, that belonged to his gutteral enunciation, and then pausing a considerable time, as if fairly to get rid of the ejaculation, he added rapidly, “vat dis dou dells, der zeerover in der oost vloed—Yonne, mien bloud ish cold, mien vingers, mien pones dremble— op myn ziel, tish nien drue, negur, niet waar Ik saai, Ik hab mien dout,” and having thus delivered himself, he with all the quietness and calmness possible after so terrible a squall, comfortably reseated himself, and resumed his pipe, leaving the amazed black to gaze at him with the utmost astonishment, for although Yonne had sometimes beheld the placable Nederlander fly into a vagary or so, which either came up to or exceeded the cause of his surprise, and had heard him execute the delivery of many staring oaths with the like flourishes, yet it was seldom that these were performed, except when the worthy burgher's peaceable disposition had been alarmingly wrought on to the full bearing of his manhood and patience, or when fairly put out of countenance at being sadly driven, teazed, and provoked by the never ceasing, and bitter attacks of his helpmate; but that any thing else in the world should have, at such a rate, moved or stirred him up, was not only singular, but alarming,—and direful misgivings and strange thoughts ran riot through the fertile brain of the faithful slave. That the announcement of what had been formerly an every day occurrence, (though for several months past it had not happened,) that a rover's barque was lying in the waters of the sound, whose neighbourhood, however to be dreaded, had heretofore only been of detriment to the poultry yards and the cattle of the Nederlanders, the numbers of which always diminished at these visits of the buccaneer, but which were amply repaid by the rich trade that was sure to follow their arrival, among the merchants, pedlars, and speculators of the island of Manathan—that this could have awakened the frigid torpidity of Mienheir Vanderspeigl 8* seemed nearly incredulous, a matter unaccountable, and indeed Yonne did not know what to make of it, so having looked sufficiently at the visage of the sturdy Dutchman, he bethought himself that it would be of no use whatever to again repeat the correct, straight forward, and not to be doubted source and channel from whence he had derived the rumour, for he was well acquainted with his proprietor's hatred of being contradicted; for when Vanderspeigl asserted black was white, or any other disputable position, if his words were not instantly assented to, he was sure to be as quick, surly, testy, and crabbed, as a snapping turtle himself, and it was all along that his wife's manner and customs were in this matter the very counterpart of his own, that the poor man dragged out such an intolerable existence, that his temper was ruined, and his flesh like a jelly on his bones; since, though it may be a very romantic theory, that when taste and dispositions assimilate in a married couple, they are the certain sources of conjugal happiness and contentment, yet the truth is widely against such interpretation, and Mienheir Sporus and Vrouw Yokupminshie, proved the latter in every sense of the word for nothing could be farther from happiness than as they lived yet on whom the fault rested will not here be determined; but still it is no more than just and impartial to say that ya vrouw herself stated with great feeling, that she was obliged to preach from morning to night, and yet it was to no purpose, for Sporus, do what she would, was never satisfied, and so it appears the poor woman talked herself as lean as a razor in her dutiful endeavours to make her spouse cheerful, while he, in spite of her affection, (as she most pathetically affirmed,) ungrateful dog as he was, continued as dogged, contrary, and cross-grained, as if he was possessed, which truly, to the amiable creature was vastly provoking; for though the obstinate mule of late never ventured to speak a word in return to her gentle and admonitory rebukes, yet what worried the kind soul almost to death, was that he would look at her glum, sour, and ill-natured as old Nick himself. Now all this had, in a certain degree, a weight and influential power on the observing, acute, and close viewing mind of the shrewd negro, and therefore having gone completely through the subject by conjecture, and finding without satisfaction, that both in thought and supposition he was drained to the very dregs, or in other words, that every idea he could muster on the occasion relative to the matter which he strived to develope, was entirely ran out without confirmation, he thought it of moment to wind up the business by coming to a conclusion, in which he definitely considered that at present it was adviseable as his safest plan to say not a word more on the matter, as it would be of no use or service for him, if not certainly dangerous and hazardous, to broach to his master's hearing aught further that had been spoken by the worthy Mienheir Boomelhyser; for though the storm of Vanderspeigl's mind seemed to be entirely blown away, it was wise not to give it fresh cause to feed on, were there any hunger left: and of a surety in this, Yonne argued in a sound, cautious, and discretionate manner, and with reasoning cool and dispassionate, and it might have been that he drew the foundation of this logic from his experience entirely, for the forest and the wild hill and bitter labour had been his only books, and there are few better, saith a wise old saw; though it must be confessed their lessons sometimes direfully puzzled and bewildered his woolly pate, as in one instance fell out while slooping to Coxsackie, up `de noordt rivier,' at the time his master hired him to old Cobus Kuypers, of Waappinger's Kreek, for as he came by the Shaangum Mountain, there blew up a devil of a squall which in a moment set the craft on her beam ends, and in the snap of a finger, swung the spanker boom about with such velocity, that forgetting all ceremony, it took the luckless skull of the black in its way, whirling it, together with the body adjoined, into the water; now, though this was rather a severe warning, yet it had its effect, for when in a pitiful plight, by the aid of the leeboard, he got on deck after his sousing, he bethought himself that all was owing to his want of civility in not getting out of the road for his betters; he therefore gathered wisdom from his misfortune, as rubbing the bruised seat of wisdom, he exclaimed, “Loramitetee be prase— ony tink now, me nebber put dis cokernut in de way agin, sartin—ven me do he velcom to gib nuder slap”—now it is no more than to be believed, that this remembrance had its force in the resolution which he had settled for his conduct, as above amply descanted on; though for all this, one might incline to think that he had equally in view the correct, memorable, erudite, and impartial decision of that sound just, and learned Dutch civilian, Dirk Von Rikkettie, of Nieuw Amsterdam, who will be found figuring to no small advantage in one of the latter books of this remarkable tradition;—but to the case in point, wherein it appears that skipper Van Wycke, of Sing Sing, was complainant, and old Mutchin Brinckerhoff, a ragged, lousy, beggarly, brazen, shirtless, breechless vagabond, without a character or a coat to his back, stood defendant; and thus it was,—while the respectable `roeyer's slupe' lay snugly harboured in der Breede-Gracht,[31] [31] This was a canal that ran up the centre of Broad-street. opposite the beurs,† † The Exchange about the year 1700 was so placed. which was on the top of the market house, right in the very centre of business, for he had arrived with a valuable cargo of radishes, manure, and aard apples, and while the skipper, who had brought for him a great round Yonker's cheese, was comfortably drinking a zoepje of peach brandy, and smoking a friendly pipe with his cousin Mienheir Van Kortlandt under the cover of the great locust tree that stood before his mill door in der molen weg, or the mill straat as it was most usually called; that strapping knave, old Mutchin, who had been watching his opportunity, for the artful dog was at all times about, poking his nose in places where he ought not to have been, and where nobody wanted him, slipt away with an old copper basin, the skipper's clam knife, and the cover of a high Dutch psalm book, upon which Van Wycke's name was written by the dominie in a flourishing Hollandsche text—now Van Wycke who was a tall, strong, raw-boned, six foot giant of a Dutchman, with huge staring black whiskers, and great long lanthorn jaws, set great store by these articles, and when he found they were gone, he swore horribly, and in a towering rage he advertised them in the Post Boy, offering a reward for their recovery of a vier stuyver stuk, and a skipple of meal, and soon traced them to a hovel in Rotten Row,[32] [32] This place was at the end of the Old Slip. the residence of Mienhier Brinckerhoff, whom he brought by the nape of the neck before the redoubtable and incorruptible Dirk Von Rikkettie, and in a blunt, Low Dutchman-like way, informed that sapient judge of his wrongs. Now Dirk having limped forward on their entrance, for he was a truly courteous man, and very condescending withal, though monstrously deep in law, greeted both parties kindly, inquiring after their vrauws and little ones, together with their own healths— and after shaking hands, began with a very profound visage to maturely weigh the state of the case in his own mind;—now it should be premised that Dirk mortally hated the whole race of Van Wyckes for they were of the old government interest, and he had joined the other side ever since they were in power—and he also well knew that old Mutchin was as noisy as he was dirty—and could lie, toss coppers, and vote in every corner of the stadt at an election time, when either a Burgomaster or Schepin was to be chosen—so after fitting and proper time his mind was made up, and in a clear audible voice he began to deliver his judgment:—first he set forth with a compliment to the high standing and well known respectability of the persons concerned—then he diverged sapiently in quotations from Puffendorf and Grotius, together with many other legal authorities, whose writings were appropriate—first he appeared to lean to one side of the question, then the other equally balanced it—then he had select cases from unknown juridical reports—then he stated what would have been the opinion of Jan Erasmus in the business—lumbering out and tossing over the whole substance of the statutes of Nieuw Nederlandts, like a skittish Flemish mare who switches her long tail about her, sending the mud on all sides—so that for a long while it was uncertain how matters stood. At last, after having kicked up a surprising dust by thus beating around in every direction, and solemnly taking every bearing of the compass that was visible, he slowly sought to bring matters into a narrower compass by ordering the honest Mynheer Brinckerhoff to be set at large, and advising him immediately to seek a remedy against the skipper for false imprisonment—and also with a very stern countenance, which he however asked Van Wycke's pardon for putting on, as it was impossible for him to look otherwise on so serious and dignified an occasion, he proceeded to admonish the skipper for his carelessness in leaving temptation in the sight of Brinckerhoff, who had the articles not been imprudently exposed, would never have had an idea of taking them; and he (Dirk) therefore could not but consider it as justice, that might in part sooth the wounded honour of Mynheer Mutchin (and the law allowed greater latitude of severity, but he refrained from the exercise,) if he sentenced Mynheer Van Wycke to pay all the expenses of the trial. At this the skipper could not help, in spite of the awe that pervaded him at the research and talents of the judge, ripping out a huge swinging oath, and giving his mustachios an undaunted and defying twist that made all stare again, and was about to make an appeal—but Dirk, interposing, said he had not yet finished, for that on account of the complainant being a resident of another county, he was doubtful of his jurisdiction in the business, and he therefore supposed that the affair of the costs would be best referred to a higher tribunal. And then finding it time to dismiss the court, he invited the skipper to walk home to his house and take a drink of brandtwyn with him—at the same time thanking Van Wycke as they went along, in the name of the Stadt, for the inflexible activity with which he prosecuted offenders against the laws. Now doubtless it is apparent to every mind of reflection, that this judgment was the best at every point for the parties themselves and the public good, that the state of the affair admitted; for had it been determined otherwise, Mutchin might have been put in the pillory, and been thrown out of his livelihood, though it was difficult to say how the fellow lived, yet he made out to get along some how or other; and losing its head and stay, his whole family would have been broken up and gone to the `werkhuis,' and so have been a great expense to the vroedschap, while on the other hand, the unsuspecting skipper would, not thinking of the matter, have placed some new temptation in the way of somebody else, and there would have been another trial and more time lost, now all this was foreseen and adroitly avoided by the inimitable decision of the immortal Dirk: and thus it was with the sapient Yonne, for as he had not the least desire that his head should again be where it was in danger of a rough salute, it struck him thoroughly that he ought not to put the smallest temptation in the view of his testy and irritable owner, so without more ado abandoning Vanderspeigl entirely to his internal cogitations, in one tenth part of the time which has been taken to relate it, the negro once again resorted and assiduously applied himself to the finishing of the labour in which he had been engaged. Meanwhile the vapours that had hovered darkly upon the heights, gathered their dusky mantles over the distant prospect, and the hoar frost hardened as the night approached near, and as the light grew fainter, the aspect of the long line of woods that skirted the river was continually changing; first could be distinctly marked mighty and majestic groups of trees even to the delicate fibres that like smooth long grass hung to the rough bark and twisted boughs, nor were branches of minor growth hid, the lithe and prickly stems of the wild rasp, the orange hipp and the percimen whose berries had been the food of autumnal birds, rustled and bowed their tender heads as the blast raved by; now like a colossal column some broad trunked and gnarled oak, whose scathed coat was whitened by moss that had been growing a hundred years, could be distinguished, erect in isolated and spectral grandeur, a leader in the forest, while mingling with its shadow, like attendants to its glories, the brown fir, the proud cedar, the noble elm, and the wild mountain ash, cloaked in their russet garbs, blended their multitudinous arms into a darksome net work; but in a short time all was mingled and merged in a sable and undefined mass, whose broken, scattered heaps, seemed like the black armour of a giant carelessly strewn amid the surrounding obscurity. The snow fell faster from its invisible palace in the clouds—its drifting and feathery flakes, now melting in their flight, anon resting on the earth white as purity, while the brown soil of winter grew chequered with its touch; at intervals broke on the ear, through the melancholy swelling of the wind, the plashing of some waterfall, that like the floating mane of a courser in flight, leapt adown the mountain's rocky side, here concealing itself as it rapidly trickled amid a cloud, over-hanging swamp wood and dying brush, that strung with icicles, the frozen drippings of the wave, glittered dazzlingly even in the night above the clear transparent waters; here bounding forth over the smooth worn stones that choaked the ravine, it rushed into the stream below—the voice of the wilderness, the appalling and gloomy solitude around, the sublime and time enduring forms, among which nature alone was paramount, all seemed scorning the weak invasion of man, with a comparison of the insignificance and transitoriness of the arts, enjoyments, and occupations, and of the brief duration of human existence itself. And now that ruthless and uncourteous ancient—impartial time! who tarrieth not for man—be he high or low—overflowing with riches, or stricken with poverty— but with the same rapid and unerring stride, passes o'er the king, priest, or peasant; the lord and slave; the festal of the victor, and the despair of the vanquished; on his sure journey moved insensibly, though scarce noted; while Yonne, though driven hard by desire, for his soul was of that o'erflowing kind, that it was a task for him to set bounds to his loquacity—remained silent, finding no favourable moment wherein he could indulge himself by a renewal of conversation; at several periods indeed the words of a new subject were on the very ends of his lips; and it was with much ado of grievous exertion, that he restrained their utterance; being alone forced to stillness, by the awe of his lordly proprietor's humours: it is to be remarked, however, that Yonne, although given singularly to earnest discourses, spoke always to the purpose: and what he said, was preferable in most instances, to the breathings of many who now are of the like disposition: for truly, to be ever chattering like a noisy ape, is a superior qualification; since to be taciturn in company, is a mark of vulgarity as well as folly—yet on the other hand, to engross the whole that is talked, by senseless words and foppish grins, is not only to be agreeable, but extremely talented and witty: as such is the conclusion, it is in no wise astonishing, that every brainless blockhead that is blest with a nimble tongue, gives it full latitude—troth, 'tis disgusting to walk abroad and mingle with the crowd, and have one's ears deafened as it were by the hollow and ceaseless clapper of a bell: for indeed there are but few circles that have not their active mouthed idol, their privileged jester and buffoon, whose mean and impertinent liberties of speech and contemptible dullness, are received current for pleasantry and smartness; and who, though an egregious ass, hath the best of countenance. It is certainly to be highly regretted, that the judicious reader should thus have been forced by the untoward disposition of circumstance, to lose what the sagacious negro would have spoken: still it is a true proverb that teaches it is an `ill wind that blows nobody any good;' and so it was with the black; for what was a deprivation to his wishes, was a considerable gain to his employment, which throve mightily in having no rival in his attention: for it seemed with Yonne as with most people—that the more fuss they make, the less they do: as is verified in the proceedings of certain assemblies; where the more they discuss a matter, the farther they are from bringing it to perfection: and thus day after day, is wasted in brawling and childish disputes—foreign to the purpose, as unsatisfactory to the hearers: so that from remarking the management of large and mixed bodies, wherein seldom unity of action or sentiment prevails, it is not to be wondered, there are many who would prefer the sway of one ruler, than the corruption, disagreements, Vol. I. 9 and intrigues of a dozen, who, when they do agree on making a law, form it so that in case of need, they may find a corner unguarded which may be turned; and it is a close observance of this crafty principle, that hath made so many of our statutes like the mesh of a spider, which to be entangled in, is certain death to all smaller winged insects; but for the buzzing bee, the stinging wasp, the hornet, and other of the greater species, it is no impediment: for wheresoever it pleases them, they can with ease tear to rags every thread of the web. As it may be expected from the premises above set out, a much briefer space had been gone through, than otherwise would have been necessary, ere the boat was, by the dexterous and alert movements of the slave, in a proper condition to execute its portion towards the interest of the ferry-master: and soon thereafter, that the object of his care might be safe from the attacks of the tempestuous weather already aroused, Yonne snugly housed the repaired schouw under the shelter of a neat straw-thatched schouwloots, that adjoined the barn and dwelling; whose roof served the swallow to hang his nest to, and where the martin and wren coops were nailed; all of which from the past summer were silent, deserted and decaying, making the dreariness of winter more palpable to the heart, and visible to the mind: and thus having concluded his toil, and shivering like an aspen with the cold, to which he was more sensitive than his hardy master, whose phlegm alone was enough to keep him warm, the black proceeded with considerable alacrity, (for the finishing of work, however worn down and fatigued the labourer may be, is always the quickest,) to collect together the implements that had assisted his skill, for the purpose of conveying them with him into the mansion: it nevertheless must be mentioned, that the speed of this performance, was interrupted at intervals by the enactor's being forced by the biting rigour with which his fingers were affected from the wind, to call in the aid of sundry stratagems, of rubbing, clapping, and blowing on the numbed flesh with his breath, to keep his blood in circulation: it was in the procedure of the latter, at a moment when a somewhat long exposure had rendered an extraordinary exertion necessary from the lips—that while bending his head in this pursuance, the bearing of the negro was attracted and his notice called from that on which he was busied, by an afar off sound, which indistinct and broken by the density of the air and weakened by its being very distant, at first was scarcely distinguishable, but soon grew stronger on the ear: Yonne stopped from his occupation, and raising himself in an attitude of listening, he strained every nerve to catch the origin of the noise, and it was not a great while ere from the swiftness of its approach, that his curiosity was satisfied; for as it became louder and embodied itself, though from the darkness and the white showers of falling particles of drift, that in hosts thickened around, dark above but bright as sea foam below, he could perceive nothing, yet soon he plainly marked the dashing of the heavy hoofs of a horse at great speed on the frozen ground, and whose course was evidently in the direction of the ferry house. An occurrence so strange and uncommon was not a little surprising to the black, who marvelled greatly thereat, since it was but seldom the custom of traders or others, who adventured to thrid the lonely, scarce broken paths of the wilderness, to pursue their solitary travel beyond the fall of evening, but sometime ere its coming it was prudent as well as necessary for them to shun danger by seeking shelter from the hundred deaths that would, armed, spring up to oppose their way, whilst environed with the gloominess and shadows of night; and further, it was entirely out of the question to suppose for an instant that any of the lusty Dutch colonists had ventured at so late an hour without the precincts of their own comfortable homesteads; and indeed both Nederlander and pedlar were too knowing as well as careful of the wind of their sleek steeds, to urge them at the rate with which the one that now approached was spurred—considering these reasons, it is not to be wondered at that various odd conjectures, surmises, notions, and flighty ideas, gathered in almost the swiftness of a moment in Yonne's teeming and fruitful imagination so that his very brain swarmed again with fearful visitations, as some how or other, (and there is no accounting for such things,) they are the maggots of the sense that thrust their heads out of their holes at every turn; and thus each dormant fear aroused in his mind, he bethought himself how it was said that the spirit of old Antony Colve a fierce, storming, swearing dragoon of a Dutch Governor, (who had been deprived of his power by an unfortuitous peace between the United Belgick States and England, in which the former ceded the colony of Nieuw Nederlandts to the latter, and had consequently smoked himself to death out of clear vexation,) was accustomed to ride round and round the seat of his former government, the proud isle of Manathan, on a winter's night, mounted on a fiery, trampling, black war horse, that snorted vengeance on the invaders of his master's rights; and so, shaking and shivering through his whole carcass as though stricken by an ague, scarce able to hide his fright, the timorous negro turned his eye towards his owner, as if to seek safety and protection from his countenance, “Mien goot Got! dishish drange—op myn ziel, tish niet him alrede,” muttered Vanderspeigl, somewhat perturbed and perplexed, for he also was started from his reverie by the sound of the galloping. “Ja! ja! der ding ish twyffelagtig—Mien Got! Ik peleives tish nien more ash der draveller, ja! der reezer vor mien schouw to croosh der veer—Got tam! tish zome Nieuw Englesch loopkramer, some tam bedlar vrom der stadt ash drades mit tem tam prutes der Indiaan—ja, Ik hersch der horsche's voet ash blain ash mienzelf—Mien Got! Ik hab een goed gehoor.” As this speech took up considerable time, for the Dutchman paused between every sentence to collect his words as well as breathe, Yonne had no opportunity to remark in answer, for now the rider, whatever he might be, was but a short space distant; the doubtful black, however, as he hearkened breathlessly to the closer boundings of the hoofs, could not refrain from whispering to himself, “Him no like a tradin massa horse, him ride too fas for dat, sartain—him nuder sort of ting, take my say: den me see a trange someting last night—me dream all 'bout de debbil too, ony tink now;” and he shook his head with a lengthened, rueful, and ominous visage. On the left of the ferry house, for about a quarter of a mile, ran a rude and narrow path, or rather track, winding around several precipitous ledges of rock and hill, until it gained the open and unfrequented country; a few yards from the building it overhung a thick and straggling copse, which sprang up along the borders of the river below, to the full length of the footway, while here and there was a small and sudden opening with a descent to the water cut by the hand of nature through the tangled thicket; beyond this stretched out a sandy and pebbly beach, over which, at nigh tide, the hasty current made its march, and sullenly murmured against the bank that stopped its farther progress; still in some places beyond the ascent, lay scanty patches of dry ground, covered and often defended from the stream by splinters of the rocks and roots which had crumbled or been washed down by the rains from the edges of the earth and crags that projected above. Guided by this difficult and dangerous way, now trampling recklessly over the sharp and flinty stones, now plashing in some overflowing of the current, whose waves tossed up their white caps, moaning as in anger, like unblest spirits threatening in their shrouds, with the carelessness of one who well knew the rugged and broken track, in spite of stock or hindrance the horseman boldly rode, the clash of his horse's feet following each other in a thick, close and uninterrupted succession, so that Yonne's words were scarce breathed from his lip ere the subject of his forebodings appeared beneath the brow of a lordly locust tree, which was fast enveloping itself in a cloak of fleece, for the snow hung like leaves to its boughs, as it stood like a sentinel at the head of one of those narrow descending ways. As soon as the rider perceived the Dutchman and his attendant, through the dense haze, he hailed them with a loud halloo of `what cheer ho!' and striking his heels lustily in the sides of the strong and mettled steed that he was mounted on, he was borne by the sure footed animal in an instant to the place where they were. At the period here written of, many varieties and fantastic fashions of garb prevailed in the province, probably owing to the combining circumstances of the time 9* for then raged in the old world disaffection, troubles and persecution—in government, religious and personal controversies; and the eyes of the anarchist, as well as the felon, the vagabond, and the bankrupted swindler whose ways of living were overstocked, undone or ruined at home, turned naturally and wistful of trial, towards a land so new, so remote, and as yet scarce operated on—so that numbers of wretches, vile and base, flying from merited punishment, and inflamed with wondrous hardihood and the spirit of adventure, sought in the new world fresh fields for daring and the exercise of their talents; and from the accession of these emigrants the inhabitants generally, for the bad will soon contaminate the good, were composed of a motley medley of rogues and knaves: and as it is wisely though homely remarked, that what is bred in the bone will follow the flesh—so it hath proved that though the community in modern days may be better than it hath been, it hath only improved in ingenuity in committing many more atrocities with impunity—for indeed such numbers of bad men, the outcast scum, the loathsome purgings of European enormities, have ever since been flowing in upon us, that every shadow of virtue that might have once been, hath totally disappeared: and as it is the interest of those who are ill of heart, to put honesty and honour out of countenance and favour—they have, by the repeated attacks, overcome all who were hardy enough to oppose, and made at last every thing so subservient to their wills, that for characters who bear in conduct affinity to them, there is not a country on the bosom of creation more favourable—hence there is no marvel that daily and hourly their host is augmented with recruits from the oldest adepts in villany—so that our whole community is reduced to one common mass of worn out pimps, sharpers, gamblers, and broken spendthrifts. As is natural, the innovation of strangers brought with it, as well as fresh crimes, new manners and customs; which as novelty, however absurd, is most greedily followed, were soon either grafted on or entirely superseded the old; and to this day the vulgar rage of imitation hath flourished to the ruin of many of its worshippers. Rich and poor, high and low, are crazed with the folly of dress;—no matter how it befits their situations in society—whether it strains their slender means—or is ridiculous from their contemptible birth and education:—here the wife of a hod carrier is beprankt in loads of lace and finery that hath eaten up in the purchase all that her labouring husband hath been able to obtain for months by the severest industry— and probably whilst she is showing out her awkward airs and decorations, her offspring are lacking sustenance in some damp and filthy cellar or garret:—there the daughters of some cheating usurious skinflint, who hath piled up his fortune by the lowest means, and who, uplifted above the condition to which he was born, the stable, the cow yard, or the bake-house, hath suddenly swelled into consequence—ape the splendour and the ways of their betters; and unmindful of their origin and forgetful of the times when the plainest garb was a rarity, they launch forth into extravagance:—one broad shouldered, coarse bouncing wench, who was certainly intended by nature for a scrub, hath her waist drawn to the compass of an hour-glass, and her robe so loaded with trimmings, that strong as she appears she hath much ado to carry it—another, rouged to the very eyes, brawny as a scullion, hath her covering so light and delicate that the wind almost carries it away:—this lady cannot stir abroad but she must have her glasses on, to show the world how learned and studious she is—but it is only abroad she wears them:—and lastly, the more strange that lady dresses, if it be but costly and differing from common people, the more she believes herself admired: and what to day excites the laughter of all, to-morrow is sought after with avidity— and the greater price set on the thing, however mean its intrinsic worth, the more valuable in the eyes of the world. Indeed with us it is only considered that high, luxurious, and magnificent living, together with fine and costly clothes—no matter whether they are in character or not—whether afforded within the means of the wearer or ever paid for—are wanted to make the lady or the gentleman. But the stranger must not be forgot, the singularity of whose attire from these remarks will not surprise the reader. He was a slight built man, though formed with that knit of shape and texture of limb that at once bespoke uncommon strength and activity. He was about the middle age of life; though a naturally sallow, swarthy and somewhat livid cast of complexion, which had evidently attained its height from the dusky tinges of a southern sun—such as his whole appearance told he had lately been toiling under—together with the half grey hairs that scantily mixed in his long, black and untrimmed locks—might possibly to the eye have added several years: yet his every look was of that wild and desperate nature, and there was about him so much of the quick glance and dauntless daring of one who cared or feared not, that the mind was forcibly stricken that he was a man rather to be shunned than encountered. In his apparel there was but little that could elucidate that course of life the wearer followed, for it was a strange mixture of mendicant garment, applicable to the sea and land; still it was not difficult to perceive that whatever might be his calling, that of arms formed a part. His jerkin was of Spanish cloth, whose delicate woof, intended for a milder clime, could have guarded the rider but ill from the stingings of the piercing blast—but this he recked not;—loose trunk hosen, such as were in use by the mariners of the era, slashed with silk, were gathered with party hued ribbons at the knee—though all was much rent, faded and discoloured, as by long and constant wear, such as would be from the straits and passes of one who voyaged the ocean, and had assumed some portions of his attire from the strange places he had visited: a large belt or bandeliere thrown over the right shoulder hung down under his left arm, and sustained an arquebuss or hand gun, which was carefully shielded from the wet and night, by being wrapt in a folding of a huge sea cloak that fell negligently from the neck, floating down on one side of the horseman, and as it was thrown back by the wind, disclosed in his baldric the glittering barrels of a pair of pistolets and the naked blade of a hanger— while a stout leathern cap, or rather a sombrero, ribbed with curves of iron, such as was worn by those on board of armed vessels who were selected for boarding, completed his equipments. “Ho, how goes it old broad stern,” said the stranger as flinging himself to the ground, which rang with his heavy tread, he rudely greeted the ferry master: while the ample and gallant chest of the brave animal that had borne him dripped with foam, which the speed that he had been driven covered him with; “how has the wind set in your canvass since last we swung in a hammock together? Santissima Trinidada! I'll wager a pistole to a marvede you've smoked more tobacco and swigged as many cans of bomboo,[33] [33] A liquor composed of a mixture of water, limes, and sugar, which was in great favour with the buccaneers.—Vide Trials of the Pirates, (vol. xiv. State Trials.) as would freight a barqua longa—by the gold of Deldorado, old dolphin! you've here quietly turned in, whilst in storm and sun we've swept the broad Pacific from Panama to the stormy Cape. Hey topirassou,† † This appeareth to me to be the name or appellation of a quadruped which liveth in Brazil. It partaketh of two species, and assuredly therefrom it may be said to be a beast of capacity; and is an indubitable representative of the conductors of the newspapers who are contemporaries with me:—verily the likeness is striking—for the topirassou is a creature between a bull and an ass, but without horns, and entirely harmless though it maketh a prodigious appearance. —T. P. how goes times ashore?” There are but few more truly awkward and disagreeable situations, trying to one's self-possession and temper, as when pursuing our way in a great hurry, on turning a corner our sight is met suddenly, and our further progress interrupted by running full tilt against some teazing, dunning, beggarly, dirty looking fellow, who has the impudence to claim an acquaintance, and from whose disgraceful companionship and button holding familiarities and importunity there is no escaping. Feelings not entirely different from one in that sad predicament appeared at the view and salute of the horseman to actuate the motions of Vanderspeigl, for first with a sheepish gaze he looked up, then down—then on one side and then on another, as though anxious to shun the stranger's eye; who perceiving the Nederlander's embarrassment, and irritated at receiving no answer to his address after a short interval abruptly continued in a rough voice. “Curse me, but you look as thof you'd fell afoul o' the flying Dutchman rather than an old messmate—you 'ant lost your reckoning, swipes;—diabolo! but you land lubbers are always stupid, like the albatross—but little can be got out of you, for as it is said, `Quen no ha vista Sevilla, no ha vista maravilla,'[34] [34] He who has not seen Seville, has not seen a wonder.—Spanish Proverb. so short yarn, out with your grapples and lash to.” Having become sensible to the backwardness of his conduct, Sporus sought to obtain a transient mastery over his actions, and while the cross and sour aspect of his visage in spite of himself belied his words of welcome, he thrust out with no cordial haste his huge hand. “Mien goot Got!” said he in a tone of affected surprise and recognition, “van vaar koomen u!—blesh mien ziel tish Eumet ash ik livsch!—hartig un wel!—mien Got! dou beest velcome aan strand, mien oude kennis op myn ziel dat dou ish.” “Nuestra Senora,” returned Eumet coldly, “but your hail drops like partridge shot in a high sea—troth, thy cutwater looks as long as Cogi Babba's† † An Armenian merchant, owner of the Kerry merchantman, which was taken by Kidd, having on board 50,000 rupees, being bound from Bengal to Surat. when we laid the Kerry merchantman aboard, yard arm and yard arm—and none of your damned yawing, old dog.

Mi amigo! you'd not let the scuppers run had we all messed below with the bellena—mass! we're all jolly and alive my hearty! top and top-gallant! riding yonder above the hellgat.” “Goot Got!” groaned Vanderspeigl in sore despair, scarcely able to contain his muttering “den ik ish in der verdamnt biece ob business—ja! ik hash der geluck, dat ish der duivelsh—ja! en dat ish hish eigen: Got tam! ik mill hab mien zeil droubled vrom mien leeven!—ja! vrom mien podies.” “Troth, I bear ahead too fast,” continued Eumet, without noticing Sporus' agitated murmurings, “I must about ship—for we should count no loss bate gunner Moore and the hermosa barco herself—a line fifty fathoms would not sound them. Virgen Santissima, as they say on the main; but Tom was un noble espiritu, as ever handled a pike under red bunting—but el y el capitan could not pull the same cable; so d'ye see the old man scuttled him, knocked his brains out with the strap bucket off the coast of Malabar.[35] [35] Kid's Trial.—State Trials, vol. xiv. Mass! there was not a boy aboard that thought the lousy dog had brains, till we saw them strew the deck; thof there was not enough blood to float a straw† † Ibid. so now his podredo esqueleto swings in a wet hammock without parson's fees—while the Adventure, poor soul, wanted copper, for her body was rotten; so we rigged the Quedagh, our gallant prize, and jilted the thing, leaving her with a lighted match to seek her own harbour—so give her your tears picaron, for she was as sweet a creature as ever ploughed salt wave or bore live oak—then as to her crew, d'ye hear, el valor nuestros marinos maketh a free ocean, and you know at a chance there are mangrove bushes and un hermosa puerto at Tobago.”[36] [36] An island famous as the rendezvous of the Buccaneers.—Vide History of the Buccaneers, London Edit. Ever since the mariner's arrival the darkness had been increasing, and now the whole face of the heavens had become of one black hue, like a mighty funeral pall—the wet sleet drove violently and swiftly about at every breathing of the wind—strong and irregular blasts of which, loaded with the drift, at times swept wildly and madly along, involving every thing around in obscurity. The freebooter wrapt him in his broad cloak, and sought to conceal himself within its ample folds from the anger of the storm; while the hardy Dutchman also began to feel concern from the increased severity of the atmosphere; for actively rubbing his hands together, he thrust them in the comfortable warmth of his wide breeches pocket, whose mouths yawned to receive them like the jaws of some monstrous abyss;—and then drawing with all his might two or three hearty puffs from his pipe, as if thereby to obtain confidence, he resumed the conversation. “Sapperment! mien guter vreind,” said he, “tish verdamnt cold—hol mich der duivel, ik ish ys—ash von kanelboom mit itsh dykes—ja! ik ish ash der Y—dat ish vrozen. Mien Got! tish ash vone zo cold nagt in December dat you shall zee—op myn zeil dis blace ish ash der Lablandsh!—Got tam!” “Mass! perro—thou sayst true,” replied the buccaneer, “the wind hath a mind to cut up all my rigging, the cold hath nearly wrecked me—carra! have you no aqua vita, or aught to warm one's hull.” “Mien Got!” returned the other, “ik hash niet— mien ver guter vreind, der vroew hash der zilver water, and der goold water, an der genever, an der Hollandts, altig in der potbank—ja! in der glozet—an der vrouw likesh it met een slotgesloten zyn—dat ish she sall keep der keysh mit der locksh zo ash any oder womansh.—Sapperment,” added he, anxious to change the discourse to which he had been betrayed, for though he was willing to refresh his own clay, he did not relish giving a drop of comfort to his unwelcome visitor; so he collected his courage, desirous to know at once the worst—“vat in der vorld Eumet mensch, makes dou come dis dime a nagt zo as dien paard sall break his neck, mit der gelop—ja! dat is hish spoed.” “Humph!” ejaculated the rover drily, at the same time casting an expressive glance on Yonne, who ever since the pirate's first arrival had remained in one unaltered attitude of fixed attention and wonder at every word that passed, with eyes distended till they looked like teacups, and glistening with the anxious curiosity that pervaded his whole frame, while his ears drank in every sound that escaped the lips of the speakers. “Mien goot Got! vat u means by humph?” exclaimed the ferry master crabbedly, and not understanding the caution, “in mien minds tish besser as dat u sbeaks blain zo ash dat bersons sall verstand de zaak, vat u wants, Got tam!” “Santa terra! hold water my little Dutch mud turtle,” rejoined the mariner, “that which I have is for your ear. El que obra sabiamente merece el abanza, as the Spaniards say—yonder gull hath piped his hands all adeck— white owl there hath his hatches loose for a cargo—cut your cables ebony—tack ship without freight and take your course to another harbour, for damn you if your black canvass is not quickly spread, I'll beat that calabash of thine as flat as the deck of a Moorish ketch—luff you dog—steer clear of my musquetoon.” “No cassin 'tall, massa—no cassin massa sartain!” cried the terrified negro, springing back at least a yard to avoid the marauder as he advanced on him, “Loramittee—ony tink—now be clebber—vy you angry so? der debbil! take care him gun—me go fas as nuder man—dere dont crumple, me gone—me gone, massa—ony tink now.” Vol. I. 10 Yonne, however, having obtained what appeared a sufficient distance for present safety, heedless of his assurance of instant departure, stirred not farther, but seemed rather inclined to return to the spot whereon he stood ere his retreat—for in spite of the savage visage of the sea robber, and although he fearfully stole a glance at the arquebuss, which his obstinacy rendered so likely to descend upon his head in anger—he still hesitated not, urged by uncontrollable curiosity, to linger, for as yet he had not comprehended the character of the pirate; and a desire to know what a person of such strange dress and language could have to say privately to his owner, awakened every dormant faculty within him. Besides, in the dumb companion of the stranger he recognised an old acquaintance, for whose being in such servitude and condition he could no wise account—all this combined gave him an uncommon share of stubborn courage; and depending on his usual alertness in case of want, should the threatened menace be attempted to be put in execution, he bravely dared the consequence of his remaining. It is true, that bravery is a faculty easily assumed, and mostly displayed while distant from danger; and the credit of its possession is often granted to some noisy sputterer, the haunter of taverns and the bully of bawds, who, swelling with conceit, and mighty in some nominal distinction which he hath himself taken without cause, and which courtesy merely allows him, or that he may have by chance obtained by hard service as a veteran, by marching and countermarching a ragged train of levies through lane and street under a destructive and heavy fire from that enemy of citizen soldiers, a raging sun; (whose power affords him an opportunity of boasting of the severity of his discipline, though in reality he may have a mortal antipathy `to that villanous saltpetre that is dug from out the bowels of the earth;' and loveth no kind of smoke except the smoke of his segar; for that bears resemblance to his own bravery—being a great deal of smoke to a little fire, and is alone kept alive by repeated puffings;)—yet fear, the very reverse of courage, hath oftentimes called it forth: many cowards, driven to desperation, have acted like brave men—dastards in their whole lives, have, when thrust forth by fear, proved victors in deadly combats. It is likely from these known and certain principles, and perhaps urged by the hope of becoming heroes from some lucky accident, that there are among us so many bitten with the mania of being chieftains without scarcely knowing the lock from the bore of a fusee—though doubtless it is neither necessary for a general to have either brains or boldness; for in truth he from whom I draw my example and supposition, hath neither; as indeed the only mystery he may comprehend is the making of his own beaver, which from so competent a judge, ought to be of the best; however, it is equally certain that the composition of that which the beaver covers, is too much mixed with the commonest wool to give its wearer any assistance at a critical moment:—nevertheless, the rashness of the prying negro was not derived from any of the causes just detailed, but solely from that which it was first explained had actuated him—unconquerable curiosity. “Curse him tam imperance—him tirty manners—ony tink der feller treat a body so cantagues,” in spite of prudence burst from the lips of the provoked Yonne at the uncivil attack of the freebooter, “him no wort mush, me see dat clebber 'nough—good as him any day, me like— him look like a tief sartain, wid all him talk,” and then turning up a nose whose nostrils naturally covered one half of his wide face, he gazed at his persecutor with one of those contemptuous glances that denoted his sense of the unmannerly breeding of his enemy, and an amazing confidence in his own superiority of gentility and education. However Yonne's continued loitering succeeded in irritating one of whom he stood in greater awe—for Vanderspeigl being probably likewise unwilling that a third person, and particularly one of so communicative a nature as the black, should be a partaker of the freebooters words, at last exerted his authority. “Yonne—God tam!” he thundered out, “zo dou is not gone mit dien tam gibble gabble—op myn zeil, ik sall preak dien kop, negur, dat is dien head, dou blaffing hond.” There was wanted no repetition of this threat, for the negro spoke aloud not a word more, but quick as the darting of a rat in his hiding place when suddenly surprised at his midnight revelling and depredation—Yonne shrunk precipitately in the door way and in a moment disappeared. SECTION II.—Concluded. “Defiendene de me!—trades over—sharks are abroad as thick as shoals on the banks,” said the buccaneer, drawing himself close to the Hollander, and leaning familiarly on his arquebuss—after, however, having first glanced cautiously around to assure himself there was none near to observe what might pass; “commissions are out that will make your friend Jacob Liesler shake in his leathern breeches like a rogue in the bilboes. Carra! there has not been such ill news abroad since we missed the Mocca fleet in Bab's Key—if the world should tack in these courses our capsterns will not longer stretch our orders,[37] [37] Vide a song said to be composed by the arch pirate Every or Bridgeman, (1696:) nor a caballero andante ship 'cept under the king's proclamation. Cielo! but I am one never down hearted while there is a rope to hang hope to, or a breeze to blow us clear of breakers—so drown care as they say on the main, bien vengas—si vengas solo.” “Mien Got! ik sall be ver zorrie—dat is in mien hertz,” replied Sporus in a tone with which he meant to commiserate—but there was little soothing in the sound of his voice, which rather resembled the hoarse and guttural growlings of some cross grained mastiff; “ja!” pursued he, drawing a long breath from his pipe, and then sending the smoke slowly voided from his mouth in the “My commission is longe, for I made it myself, And the capstern will stretch it full larger by half.” face of his companion—“ja, hoe does all dis gebueren— dat is, vat does it come vrom—ja! tish nien goot—tish nien goot—mien Got!” and then slowly and dolorously shaking his head as if to show the depth of his foreboding, he drew the pipe from his lips, and with a forceful blow he sent forth a volume of smoke that had for a long while been concentrating in the huge corners and monstrous cavities of his hollow jaws. “Guardate! dont run out a false colour, hermano; I know your rigging too well for a wrong chase,” answered Eumet, while a smile of derision passed across his dark and sunburnt features, “the Spaniards say `todo arbol se conoce per su fruto,'[38] [38] Every tree is known by its fruit. and, picaron, I have sailed life's ocean too long not to tell a shark by his teeth—but come Dutchman,” added he, clapping Vanderspeigl on the shoulder so stoutly that he crouched from the touch, wincing with pain. “Yo te amo—that is, I love thee— and now's your time to return favours, or damn me I shall give you a salt eel for supper—for as I just let you know, all's going by the board;—d'ye hear me—I am without a copper.” “Ja!—Ik dort as mush!” groaned the Netherlander, his jocund shaped face losing its rotundity, and the long bushy brows that overhung his little grey sleepy eyes moving simultaneously together and darkening in an anxious frown. “I'm a mendigo, stript as bare as the poles in an hurricane,” continued the rover, “so d'ye see, I'm come to lighten your locker of part of its ballast:—there's my share of the yellow boys, the booty of the Scudder merchantman,† † The name of a rich vessel taken by Kid.—Vide State Trials, vol. xiv. —how say you knave—que no respondeis— give me an order for an hundred pieces of eight on the house in Nieuw Amsterdam—it will set me apiè-afloat as gallant as a galleon.” “Mien goot Got!—dou be'est craze—mad as ish von littel hares in de sbring dime,” exclaimed Vanderspeigl, raising his hands in the utmost astonishment, “vone hondred 10* bieces von eight, bresarve me!—Got tam!” he added testily, his choler fast rising, “dou dinks ik is all geldt. Sapperment! ik hab nien stuyver in vone gorner von mien broeks—ja! ik ish vone zeer boor mensch—dat ish as bad zo as vone rotten haaring dat dey give der hond.” This petulancy did not, however, have the desired effect, or stop the marauder's demands; for ere Sporus had well ended his explanation, he strode within a foot of him and gazed sternly in his face. “Come swabber, overhaul your chests,” said the pirate abruptly, in a sneering voice, “how many doubloons have you laid by from that cargo, after cheating the revenue?—San Joachin! draw for the gold and be damned to you.” “Mien zeer guter vriend, dou dinks der guilder last vorever? ja!” rejoined the ferry master, retreating back as the other advanced on him, and speaking with as gentle and placable a manner as he was capable, “Ik has baid de brize moneys dat sall be dien zo long as dat u sall zee;” so saying he drew from his `broeks' a torn, dirtied and well thumbed Low Dutch ballad, on the blank side of which was scrawled some Hollandsche characters and figures, to which having called attention by pointing with his finger, he continued, “dere mien vriend is der reckening—dat is der calculations op der zum dat is baid— dere ish blain mit drute—dwendy guilder von der schepen—dirty von der schout”— “Thou miserly, lying, cheating picaron!” roared the angered sailor, “you and those beggarly corrupt rascals would swallow up an Indiaman:—But knave,” added he, fiercely grasping the breech of his arquebuss in one hand, while with the other he strongly seized the shrinking Vanderspeigl, “an I thought thee worth an ounce of lead and charge of powder, I'd tear your canvass rag from rag, but I'd haul the right tale from thee; thof curse me, thou smuggling porpoise, an you do not in the shifting of a block sign for the broad pieces—traidor! I'll tar that double jacket of thine till there is not a seam except of running blood on its cowardly owner's carcass—perro! I'll batter that hull of thine while there sticks a plank to its rotten ribs to keep the stingy frame together.” “Mien waarde vriend—mien zeer guter vriend,” moaned the affrighted Dutchman, striving to mollify the rage of the mariner, and sinking his short pursy form into a heap beneath the powerful gripe with which it was assailed, “op myn zeil! dou sall hab der beices. Goot Got! dou is ash hot mit bassion, ash vire, ja!—zo ash der blexemstaal dat is der lidt'ning dat vlashes—ik mill run vor der baper—dou sall hab der bieces, myn guter vriend.” “Not so hasty, lubber, I've brought all things, even to the purser's quill,” said Eumet producing them, “here clap your anchor—a hundred, a round hundred, rascal— do you mark? The Nederlander, while his determined tormentor stood watching over him, with the muzzle of the piece on a level with his head, though scarce alive with terror, or conscious what he was about, complied quickly with the marauder's demand, and signed the draft handed him; which he had no sooner finished, than the other eagerly snatched it from him; and having carefully folded it, he placed it securely in his jerkin: while Vanderspeigl by this motion being relieved from the present threatened and imminent danger, turned his eyes towards his garment where it had been held by Eumet—the place of whose grasp was plainly visible, from sundry rents and lacerated marks of violence. “Mien got bresarve me,” he grumbled, unable to refrain his anguish at the sight, “zee heir—got tam! u dake a jonker mit his droat, as he was zo as a bear—op myn zeil, u sall nien be willing to bay vone zingle stuyver to mend dis jakje—ja—it mill gost more as vat dat is.”— “Avast, my bold hearted mosco, be of good cheer about it”—returned the mariner, as with a loud laugh he replaced his arquebuss in the support of the bandalier. “Yo so agradacio![39] [39] I am grateful. round bow—that's thanking you like a true tar for the supply; and now, since I've mine own freight aboard, I'll stow cargo for others; for I am cursedly tired with looking at that ugly cats-head o' thine: and if I anchor longer before your inhospitable harbour, I shall hoist as many colours as a dying dolphin. Mass, I am already an ice boat; therefore I must run up my sail: nuestra senora, but first I've orders for thee; low deck—the old man says you must heave anchor—for as I tipped you a glass or so since, the little gentleman who's rigged in black velvet[40] [40] William III. hath shipped the province a new ruler—but the dog is wind bound at Catsdown, and be damned to him: thof diabolo, his convoy parting company, hath brought to in the very jaw of the sound; we slipt her in the fog, and were it not for policy, in spite of her iron teeth, we'd muzzle her—but d'ye see, they might send the despatch in a leaden cannister to the sea's bottom; so mark me, Dutchman, without spinning a long yarn, we must have her papers or our jig's up; for thof we have friends in Old England, as Kid says, who will bring us off, it is hard to treat with the conqueror after the flag's down: now ere I steered here, a canoe rowed for the creek in which was the king's messenger; the galliot herself, I take it, is fearful of venturing without a pilot down the river; so hark ye, rogue, the captain leaves much to thy ingenuity; they will perforce seek your guidance,—and then,” whispered the desperado, “you must run the old tack—and there'll not be a great difficulty to give them short shrift, a burial ground, or a winding sheet.” “Ik dravel ad dis uur,” replied the phlegmatic Hollander, every bit of resolution within him aroused at the idea, “dou sall nien dink zo—got tam! 'tis one zo storm— ja—zo cold nagt as dat u zee in der louwmand—dat is der dime von midden winter—op myn zeil,” continued he determinately, “ik will niet sdirs vrom mien huis vor all dat Von Trump was—sapperment! “Santa terra, buey! but thou shalt obey,” said the buccaneer, turning suddenly round from the horse which he was preparing to remount, and interrupting the Dutch man, “diabolo! refuse, and in the flash of my petronel, your blood shall die the snow,”—he shouted in a voice that made his hearer shake at its sound—“picaron, the red flames of your hovel shall be a beacon on the coast; your glutted lockers shall not have one real to keep them from emptiness; not a hound that you cherish shall live: damn you, hedgehog—your hide shall be stript in thongs, and tanned from the yard.” “Bresarve me,” faintly ejaculated the cowering Vanderspeigl, his courage momently escaping him as he expostulated with, and strived to calm the marauder— “mien guter vriend, your blood is zo warms as in vone long day that is in Shune—op myn drute! do blease, mien friend, ik mill dravel to der Guilderland—ja, ik did dry u mit mien jockkernie—mien vun.” “Avast! you need not take that latitude,” answered the rover—“but time wears; an thou dost mutiny, beware! ho, my caballo!” pursued he, smoothing the broad flowing mane of his restless steed—who during the action that had passed, had impatiently, with fretful pawings, dashed up the drift and sand that encircled his hoofs; “are you 'most ready for a cruize?—and you, messmate, look ahead how you trim your ship,” continued he, turning a deriding glance on the crest fallen Nederlander as he sprang into his seat; “thof blow what breeze may, I shall bless your hundred pieces, lo agradacio infinito mi amigo[41] [41] I am infinitely grateful, my friend. as the Spaniards say. Mass! you may see a second draft when this runs low; but for now, buen noches—veti en paz,† † Good night—go in peace. senor Close-chest.” And striking his heels sturdily in the flanks of the horse, the gallant animal sprung like an arrow through the night—and darting down the long track by which he had advanced, in a few minutes both steed and rider were lost to the view. “Der tam birate—der tieving hond,” growled out the ferry-master—the long pent up flood of gall bursting forth with all the virulence of an angry stream breaking its dam; “ja, hesh sdole dat bay paard, mit de vite sbot all over mit him: blesh mien hertz, tis grying Benson's hosh, dat livsh at der kommons. Ja—der zeerover—got tam! hesh dakenmien brincibal—vone hundred—mien got, Ik sall loseder belaang—dats de inderish—vyf ber cend—goot Got! Ik sall be ruin—ja! got tam, Ik sall be ruin.” The Dutchman having thus sorrowfully expressed himself, paused and listened a short period, with an elongated and melancholious visage, to the hollow, sullen and retiring echoes of the horse's tread, muttering indistinct curses between his teeth, and giving over the buccaneer, without remorse or reservation, to the devil. Being somewhat satisfied with this severe revenge—and all the oaths applicable, furnished by his fertile imagination being exhausted, he surlily shrugged his shoulders and turned to retire, when right in his path he perceived an abused companion;—the fragments of his pipe were scattered before him; it had dropt unfortunately, during one of his partial stresses from the embracing lips of its owner, and had met a destructive reception from the frozen earth whereon it had fallen. “Got tam! myn byp is broke,” he lugubriously groaned—“dirty dousand bieces—myn byp—Got tam.” As he grumbled these expressive words in woeful spirit, he seized with a hand at each corner, the colopeye of his huge `broeks'—which either from the agitation, or the uncommon exertions he had been forced to undergo, were fast escaping by gentle slips from the situation they were used and intended to occupy: (for in those times, the waistband was the only supporter;) and giving them a fretful hitch, that brought all back to its duty—he, (the puissant Mienheer Sporus Vanderspeigl, slow and thoughtful, bearing a countenance whose expression was that of vinegar itself, while wending dolorous and malcontent unto that retirement and solacing shelter, of which, had it not been for the goed Vrouw's usurpation, he was lord and master)—strode into his domicile,—the ferry-house of Harlæm. And so worthy and patient reader, he having thus taken it in mind to depart, I shall with his disappearance, make an end of this first book; not however, without inviting you, if your stomach holds good, and your appetite be as yet unsated—to turn your eyes to the fresh food which is served up in that which cometh next.</field>

Why this history o' thine is but a lie Fit for a charlatan—a disjointed thing Born by fits and starts—having no symmetry: A worn out cloak, filled with motely patches: A kind of labyrinth, where the thrider Hath no sooner set forth, than he is brought Disappointed back unto the entrance: It hath more flourishes than a fiddler's Prelude; more prosing than a sailor's narrative: And as many new beginnings, as a Repentant sinner's life—who no sooner Gets fairly through with one peccadillo, Than he slips as it were by mere habit, In another; yet roundly swears that each Shall be the last.— A RIGHT WOMAN. The potent wand of the storied necromancer of Arabia, hath dwindled to the feebled rush that bows before the blast, in comparison to the enchanter pen, whose touch portrays the boundless fictions of modern romance: the tameless spirits of the elements, earth, air, fire, and the living waters, ever wait its magic calls; are ever obedient to the wizard's command; while alone of all created things—(guided by imagination, upborne on free and soaring pinion,) the mind whose thoughts it sets upon the page of man, ranges uncontrolled as a creature of sthe air itself, the unlimited space of time, ransacking the almost forgotten stores and buried ashes of the long departed—searching and renovating to its own purpose and use the chronicles, records, and rude and mouldering pages of legendary lore, of ages past; bidding, as did in ancient day, the wise and holy cabalist, by a word, the scattered and dust dissolved flesh, to revisit the dry and carious bones of death, with life, and vigour, and freshness, as in the hour of their breathing actions, when animation dwelt within them; commanding the wanton and fickle winds to give back the wild and wandering rumours they once swelled with, and tell of mighty tales of hard fought contests; of triumphs, of wars, and raging storms; of leprous plagues and foul diseases—which, since spent, that merely the memory thereof was known, had in their angered and deadly passage, depopulated, spoiled and laid waste to deserts, wide regions; making the grass to grow within the city's streets, and turning the fair face of health, of beauty and of youth, to the livid and pallid colour, that loves to creep with fading hue upon the hot cheek of yellow sickness, eating away the roseate tint of loveliness, and struggling for its banquet with life itself:—yea! filling the now earth-choked and unregarded sepulchres, with all the then brave, rich and great. At once, even in the flight of a vision, hath it called the proud city—that of all its relics of ancient splendour—its marble palaces—its bright and glittering spires—its haughty temples, lofty and carved colonnades and frowning citadels, whose names of glory time hath scarce preserved, to rise like the summer's sun, redolent in magnificence; its busy crowds and thronged marts awakening to the sight: nay, more—unbridled fancy hath dived down in the ocean's womb, and with curious eye gazed in its chrystal and untrodden caves—where, hid from human search, are heaped treasures that would make the heart of prodigality run over with desire, and craze the miser with coveting; where alike, with the bleached and cadaverous remains of the sea whelmed mariner, and the green webbed nest of the water snake, sleep in obscurity, the dusky amethyst, the lily coloured pearl, Vol. I. 11 whole beds of coral—the yellow bars of gold, washed by the waves for ages, even to sand—the vast wrecks of the richest argosies, that ever swam on the bosom of the dark blue deep—all, all come and appear at the sorcerer's beck, changing and flitting like shadows in some brilliant dream of midnight, which as music listened to in youth's spring tide, dwells long upon the memory though the notes are hushed in silence. From the premises set down, understand not reader, (be you gentle or simple) that it is meant that all the tribe of quill-drivers are thus gifted; for it requires but a small share of observation or study, to perceive the vanity of the multitude; for where there flourishes one individual endowed with the necessary qualities, there are a thousand scrawlers, besotted with ambition and ignorance, and the desire of imitating; who spring up weed-like, sucking the wholesome juices and poisoning the fatness of the fresh and fruitful soil, as tares in a wheat field: for in all man strives to copy man: he is a mere creature of imitation, not less than the animals of the forest: the ass, though stupid and insignificant, with clumsy hoof attempts the proud tramp of the gallant charger: the ape mimics with antic and fantastic capers, the noblest actions of humanity: and even so will coarse conceit, and impudent and selfish consequence thrust themselves in the path of aspiring and eagle flighted talent: but what is more to be lamented, by the aid of their very assurance, they are too often for a time enabled to mislead and deceive, obtaining a momentary and shameful applause: for indeed false merit is many times taken for the true; because while the one sinking beneath its own diffedence, scarcely dares show itself, the other with loud and insolent boastings, is constantly pushing forward: and while the first is surrounded with starveling myrmidons and prostitute flatterers, who are forced for their own subsistence to keep it in credit, the last is unassisted, unadorned, and hath nothing beyond its own virtue to recommend it. And further, prejudice will go great lengths; and when that infirmity hath taken sway, the weakest drivellers, even by persons of excellent mind, are commended; while the brightest parts appear intolerable organs of nonsense or stupidity. Indeed it is to be remarked, whether it can be owing to that blindness which policy or passion casts on the understanding, or the careful prudence of faction, is difficult to determine, that even the many shallow, empty-brained dependants of a party, who undertake by noise and impudence, calumny and gross railing, vile lying and scurrility, to advance their cause, are considered in the light of sensible and witty writers: yet these evils have their remedy in time—as the strict examination which it calls forth, withers undeserved laurels—for not even the strong barriers that wealth may build, are able to oppose its sure and steady march: nevertheless the crowd is ever imposed on—for it seems as if universally, the reason and judgment of mankind; (if indeed the multitude have those faculties,) are sunk in inertness and indolence: so much so, that where there is naturally a strength of thought, and a vigour of reflection, the nature of the beast (the term must be permitted) strives against allowing itself scope even when demanded in action by an incident of uncommon moment. Assuredly people in general take too little trouble to think for themselves; they are ready at any time to receive an opinion formed and expressed by others, even though its fallacy be apparent, and it hath gone the regular routine of conversation when applied to the subject in question, a month past: and though it hath the foul impression of its original birth, and bears the marks of the narrow mind—the selfish view—the particular and actuating feeling: the hired and ignorant strain of the first framer, it still has its effects; for the greatest liar, has those who believe and place confidence in him; and though the untruth which he hath coined lives but an hour unexposed, it hath done its work; there are its votaries who will not be convinced of its error:—How seldom is there met that man, who, totally divested of malice, of littleness of mind, of private envy or public enmity, will give to that which he reflects or speaks on, a fair, candid and impartial representation: who will take in the range of his argument and idea, the bright and gloomy sides; giving them a like chance; neither seeking to draw an unkind inference, nor disposed to receive aught which is not broadly shown; but holding the affair as it should be viewed in truth, not giving his sense to one side, until he has heard and understood the other: while daily the mob is seen to be led on and wielded by the busy tongue of some shallow-pated and noisy egotist, whom principle and interest urge on to corrupt the manners, blind the understanding, and destroy the honesty, of all whom he can; and who frequently, by the power of his own emptiness and self-sufficiency, (this is from existing life) raises himself to be the very sparrow-hawk of the circle wherein he holds forth; gaining, though despicable in reputation, by dint of loud words, an empire over the supine, languid and careless spirit of his listeners, who would not put themselves to a minute's labour from the laziness of their natures, to refute the hollowness of his doctrines, or overturn the flimsy foundation which he argues on. Again it is to be observed, that man is greatly a follower of habit; and were it not for the uncommon stupidity of some, even in the earliest childhood, one might incline to the opinion that supposes providence hath not granted one of his creatures, more by nature, than another; but that it is the custom, the accidental taste, the treatment, and a thousand directing circumstances of infancy, that points the course taken, and the faculties shown, in after manhood: for many, who would have made the world wonder as writers or statesmen, have climbed the trembling mast, and toiled on the weltering deck: many who would as warriors have conquered, sleep unknown beneath the osiers of a rustic tomb; and many who would by the fire of eloquence have roused a nation, have laboured for a single crust to sate life's cravings, in the most menial office—and so it is ordered, for the sake of that inequality which constitutes society: yet from this, there is reason to believe, that could the true roads be pointed out in youth, that few could boast of a superiority to their fellow sojourners of mortality: but as it has just been stated, it may be custom, habit, from being cribbed and bound in servile dependence on one another, in the state termed civilization; that is owing that want of strength, that womanish weakness of mind, that dares not, when convinced, contend against the incorrect voice, that nearly always guides the popular feeling; though when that very feeling hath subsided, or met with some bar that hath sent it back with the force of a mighty whirlwind, to the right way: for popular feelings, are as the clouds of sand driven by the desert siroc—ever shifting, ever assuming new forms and shapes; there are many, (after it hath become notorious how widely mistaken they have been,) who quick enough take undeserved praise for judicious foresight, justice of reflection, and predictions of the event as it had happened; while it wants but small stretch of remembrance, that these had been loudest in the wrong: and thus it is— if one begins the cry, all follow in the wake, yelping and open-mouthed, even as the pack, the leading hound; though it is extremely probable, the loudest noise-maker, and the most hollow throated knave, hath the worst reason for his conduct: this, and no more, are the wheels that bear the movements of party rage and political factions: for who is it that is exalted on the shoulders of the mob—who holds the helm of government—at least popular ones? Is it the wise, the honest, or the deserving of the nation? No! the people are darkly led on, plunged in night; they are deceived in all things; their name is only used for their destruction; an engine to further the views of intriguing and designing rascals: they believe themselves all powerful—but they are mocked—they are driven unknown to themselves—they are ruled as by rods of iron—they are misled by artful stratagems—and what is worse, many times they rush wittingly into bondage, and grasp their chains, with eager hands and open eyes: for who are at their head—who are their spokesmen—their dependance? a miserable, beggarly set of half-starved blockheads: ruined at once in fortune and reputation, whom the convulsions of the day, and their own insolence, have drawn out of obscurity—who unable to earn their bread by industrious and honorable means, fly to a trade, which, such is the depravity 11* of the time, its, followers may be known and drawn in one single sentence: if he is a politician, he is an office seeker; if he is an office seeker, he is little better than a scoundrel, a sycophant, a hypocrite, and a lying rogue: and is this not proved? go, doubter, and ask who write for the public journals; who bustle in the world; who brawl at city meetings; who cry at the corners on an election; half-starved physicians, who lack practice from their ignorance; swindling, client-skinning, pettifoggers, retailers of the law, whose wit at knavery, hath run too dry to get a livelihood; bankrupted traders, and drunken, ruined mechanics: all an outcast, outlawed, desperate set!—undeniably, such are the great leaders of our political struggles; all caring not one jot what becomes of the people, their liberty, or their rights, so they themselves are taken care of; and to accomplish this, they overthrow without remorse, every obstacle: they adjust, to further their pernicious and selfish views, the principles and the constitution of the government; having their hearts set on how to get or to keep their places: they mingle and sow discord among all; changing nature itself—setting brother against brother—neighbour against neighbour—so that no man is either a citizen or friend—however great his honour, patriotism and religion, unless he be of the same side.—And again, who are they? What a throng of despicable villains present themselves in answer to the question: behold yon sycophantic lawyer—filled with mean, low cunning, gained from the rabble and dregs of society, with whom his business lies, and from whence he hath sprung: glutted with stripping thieves of their plunder, and robbing the burglar of his booty, that it may serve his debaucheries— a licensed highwayman of the bar—winked at in his rogueries, when he should be sent to the same bourne with those whom he defends, and whom his ignorance or his cupidity, often condemns—see him changing from side to side, as each party prevails, as often as the shifting current of the waves: shallow and brainless, he roars aloud —but the brain and heart that guides it, is as empty of honour, faith, and all that good men delight in, as the sound that forms the words he utters—out on it! out on it! the purchase and the price of such a man is in the hands of all. And yet he is surpassed by his comate— fit friend for such a being—(fiends make compacts)—a real descendant of old Macklin's hero—who, had he lived in the days of that stern satirist, would have given the ancient fresh hints for his Scotchman, of consummate villany, that he never, with all his misanthropy, could have believed man capable of conceiving or acting: a civilian—just possessed of talent enough, to make his roguery more atrocious: a politician—but of that corrupt class, that he would embrace an opportunity of committing the blackest wickedness, to keep or obtain an employment—and is ever, at a moment's warning, ready to throw off his allegiance, and turn from the party, whom from interest he has espoused: just such a character one would have to set, were he going to draw the portraiture of a man, who, placed in an undeserved public office, would turn the power derived therefrom, to his own private use: who devoid of every sense of honour, humanity or honesty, and swayed by the blackest demon of revenge, would meanly persecute and crush the unfortunate: a man indeed, who was he placed in the situation, would act, if his temper be rightly judged, like the notorious Finch, the solicitor general of James the First, who, while public prosecutor against Lord Delamere, forgot the manners of a gentleman, and breaking down the virtuous barrier of disinterestedness, which should have actuated him, became the corrupt and violent partisan and declaimer: but the province hath a precedent of character nearer—for when that Bayard, of whom farther on this narrative makes mention, was accused of treason and sedition, Weaver, the king's attorney, hearing the jury was loth to bring in a bill, is said to have shown his heart by crying out, “that if they found not an indictment, he would have them trounced—and that though Bayard's neck was gold, he would hang him.” Thus would this man act, was chance to place him in such a station; for instead of the first to quell, he is the first to lead the riotous and disaffected, even though he should commit the greatest crimes; but he is one that would not stickle at a trifle—for a moment's spite; he would without shame, nay, glory in it as an honourable deed, defile the house of God: the name of sacrilege, from youth hath been familiar with him; he is the leader and the spokesman of every noisy blackguard; instead of obeying the laws he breaks them, and winks at the crimes and enormities of his friends and partisans; he would make a partnership of knavery with the released forger, and cover, as the parent bird its unfledged young, the atrocious enormities of his companions:—but it is disgusting to dwell longer on this contemptible subject—yet there is an Italian proverb, that tells us there is a gallows for every rascal. Hic multa desiderantur. From all this, a conclusion may be formed, that human laws will ever be defective, and that knaves will always find out some invention to elude their force; for their wits being ever industrious, it rarely happens that honest men are able to guard against them. “But what hath all these wise dissertations, these tedious episodes, and these round about flighty wanderings, to do with the progress of the story,” inquireth the worn out reader of the composer: “you are wrong, master author—positively wrong.—these are not times for wholesome satire: and between us, if you bend your bow, your shaft will be blunted on hard rocks— for folks now-a-days, care very little about being told their faults—so it is in vain you cry down vileness and ignorance—as not only brass, but lead, is above par value in the market, saith the stock jobber, or rather the honourable member of a certain honourable board[42] [42] This sentence of the colloquium between the auctor et lector, puzzleth me exceedingly; seeing that, I believe, the words of the text have an allusion to some matter or thing, whereof there is now no trace or authority: howbeit, in the elder day, the epithet `honourable,' was of great signification, and choicely and sparingly used: moreover, few men had attained its application: albeit, the matter is reversed in these times, and every blackguard putteth in his title thereto; so that could the text be applied to men of this era, or any institution whereof the foundation had been laid within late date, I should fain construe it as an ironical designation for some community of sharpers, black-legs and rogues, who like a band of thieves, had joined together, the easier to plunder the unwary, who divineth not their mysteries.—T. P. —for both these commodities are greatly dealt in, especially by editors—and imported by the wholesale from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and the other New England States. Though if you intend to cry down the vices of the time, heaven forefend you die not ere the enumeration be finished: therefore friend, take this advice— trouble your head no more with other people's doings, but look to your own—and without more ado, travel on with this matter between us, of which I am already in despair of understanding—for I begin to lose the connexion of the plot and every thing else: but before you set out in earnest, let me tell you, if you wish to make the thing palatable, after trying my patience as you have done, spice your story well with murder, madness and love—or rest assured it won't do.”— “Well on my word, I believe you are right, and I'll strive to comply—but I am of such a singular and digressive nature—(for I am writing perfectly at ease, determined to inhale every fragrant flower that I meet;) that it will be a severe trial for me to restrain my humour, nevertheless I must confess, that although I respect what you have said, being at leisure and not caring, as long as you accompany me without downright grumbling, how far I am from my journey's end—I cannot help but think it will be pleasant, when the road is particularly dusty, that we make a short excursion in the fields—though it will be a sufficient hint for me, when you get tired, that you yawn, or turn over the pages with a slight glance. Yet as to your concluding sentence, I can only assent in part: for it is now the fashion among all great writers, to forget the plot, or put it on the last page—being the most inferior ingredient of the composition: however, the proem above indited, like the unmeaning and hackneyed sentiments of an argumentative discourse in Congress, which gives you more trouble to understand than read, will serve to amuse and keep you in play—while at a gentle pace, I transport myself across the threshold of the puissant Mynheer Vanderspeigl's domicile: the door of which, just opened, I have some time been holding, for the purpose of describing somewhat of the interior; whither, if you have no objection thereto, we will enter before the magnanimous owner—who in the present instance moved heavily; weighty with dubitation, and feeling in nearly as sharp a disposition, as a certain modern orator and statesman, who having carried his speech in his pocket to a political meeting—nevertheless on rising to give vent to his eloquence, and astonish the natives, found at a pause, that unfortunately, he had dropped the manuscript, which was to prompt him by the way—and so after thrice in vain attempting to proceed, he sat down as he rose—even as that wondrous hen—who cackled and cackled, and cackled, about the barn yard for three winters, but never laid an egg.” The huge log blazed cheerfully on the broad hearth, and sent up the wide and cavernous mouth of the chimney, rolling clouds of smoke, while basking in the grateful warmth, with that love of heat which characterizes the African, as close as it was possible to creep in the fire-place, was stationed our old acquaintance, Yonne. His legs resembled, when drawn together at the ancle, an octagon window—or rather, if a digressive simile may be allowed, his were such a couple of shanks as would elicit the unbounded admiration of a horse-jockey, and would gain for him from a person of that respectable calling the appellation of a well set man; for the shin bones ran in that perfect and graceful curve, which, if their proprietor was mounted on a racer, would have secured his safety, as though they were a pair of braces made to the shape of the steed's body: now these legs, which were an ample illustration of the saw, that there cannot be too much of a good thing—for they were of a wonderful even thickness from the knee downwards— were cased in two redoubtable cast off jack boots of the Mynheer's; but in whose wearing, the utmost attention had been bestowed on economy; for long before, they had been given on a pauwse holy-day, by the generous Vanderspeigl, to his slave: the sole of one foot, had been completely worn out to a sieve; while but little more praise could be given to the other, for fellows, without a violation of description, they could not be called: and as the Dutchman, in his personal affairs, always practised, and manfully stuck to the maxim, that a thing should not be thrown away, if any use whatever could be derived from it: so that although one of the pair might, by misfortune or accident incidental to protracted usage, be rendered unfit for further service, he was wont to take care of that which remained, as in case of unfavourable weather, he might preserve his best boots, which had cost him ten stuyvers—for they were of the first cut of Tony Von Slyck, the shoenmaker of Nieuw Amsterdam: still this which was about to be described, was perfect, except the heel and one side having given way—being to the disgrace of the thread with which it was worked—burst in a monstrous gap—so that from these unavoidable occurrences, while Yonne's toes in a state of admirable nudity and cleanliness, as if in defiance of frost and cold, and as wearied of confinement, paraded in respectful obedience from the point of the one boot; his other foot, either from a knowledge of the cool reception it was likely to meet, or from being unable to force its way from a narrowness in the passage, (which was unconquered by coaxing or grease,) scarcely made its way half down the upper leather, as the cobler designates it: yet necessity being the mother of invention, here supplied her part—for the heel, by constant residence there having formed its bed, the remainder unattended to and entirely neglected, hung useless and unoccupied on one side: however, this superfluous ornament, like a dirty, noisy vagabond who has nothing to do in the world but make a great clamour, that people may suppose him a person of magnitude and business, kept up such a constant, everlasting, never failing clatter, that when the negro was in motion, he seemed as if he had a dozen tin kettles and pewter pans adjoined to him. After this specimen of frugality, it will not be improper to remark, that in general this excellent virtue has disappeared—or at least there are but solitary instances of its practice; not but what meanness is in perfection, but it is of that sort which prompts a man to go to every length, and pursue every low method to entrap and cheat another: but with themselves, they believe all depends on show; that their character consists in their appearance; and that he whose coat has lost a button and is worn to the threads, is no better than a rogue; but he who runs up a bill at a fashionable tailor's, is of the first standing. And further, it is the aim of all to appear beyond their sphere—this man, not worth in the world a farthing, must have his furniture of the first kind—so he takes every way to deceive and get credit—fills his house and then breaks: this lady is bitten with a fever to buy all that is sold at auction, of the latest and newest—she crowds her rooms with costly and unnecessary articles, but for which her family has no use; her tables must be of rose-wood, exquisitely carved and gilded—all for show, though not for wear: if the fashion of last year is offered her for comparatively one third of its worth, she will turn up her nose as scornful as a queen—“sooth, what is she to do with such trash? indeed she would not give it house-room, though it might do well enough for some who were of the lower order”—nevertheless it is not improbable, could this fine lady think so far back, that an age had not passed since she was fortunate in having a deal board to set to—and was happy instead of feeding off of China, to take her meals from the coarsest earthen ware.—But to the black, who at the present instance, being seated in comfort, had both of his crooked yet sturdy supporters, resting against a huge mound of ashes, that had been collected and heaped up by that tidy housewife, dame Vanderspeigl, with the most extraordinary nicety—not a grain protruding on the bright surface of the pavement of Holland brick, which shone in a gay coat of Dutch pink, tastefully polished with molasses. As most of the ornaments of the worthy negro's person have undergone a description, it would be unbecoming, and really not doing him justice, to neglect a mention of those useful limbs his hands, especially bearing in view that which they were engaged at; natheless, they were as delicate as might be expected, although of the real shoulder of mutton make, and were, when spread, not unlike an Indian pancake, presenting to the sight of the curious, two high prized and deep tinted hues, the outside being of the most durable and stable black, while the palm was a mixed copper and dingy red-in truth they were an exceeding proper explanation of that new order of architecture, the very offspring of modern taste, science, and refinement, that in the same edifice allows that extraordinary diversity, a front of white marble and a rear of brown stone; amply proving that the ancients knew nothing about building, with all their pretensions—their vaunted chastity and simple grandeur of effect; for what were these to the divine conceptions of a Corporation committee? What, though jesters may liken the structure in question to a vestcoat pattern, still how infinitely obligated is posterity to that wise head and erudite ingenuity, that in so expensive an undertaking could make out to save money—who notices how much it wants in breadth, or that it lacks any proportion, when their admiring eyes gaze on that effigy which surmounts it; that wooden representation of justice, that with hands extended seems ready to grasp every thing within its reach: (a just emblem of the deeds that under its name is enacted, for he that can best fill its hands is surest of his object)—But the hands of Yonne are those that ought to engage the attention, for the one was busily employed in steadying, with the aid of his chin, the support of his huge fiddle whose ravishing power entranced the soul of the musical negro, and solaced his vexed spirit, which, as the reader is aware, had been wrought on to irritation by the incivility of the rover, so that his whole soul was dissolved in harmony of his own making; while the fingers of his Vol. I. 12 other hand gracefully drew the bow athwart the catgut, in time to the contortions of both visage and body, for the last at every proper period, as by way of assistance to the melody, moved slowly backwards and forwards with a see-saw action, like the pendulum of a clock; added to this, with not an unharmonious throat, as has been hinted was his custom, he poured forth in voice some catch, the words of which hath not reached these times by tradition, though the famous tunes of `Greenland dat's a barren place,' and `Toraches the buttermilk's fat, Toraches,' are of such antiquity that they might be ventured without an anachronism to be inserted, but as this narrative is one on which much may be relied as an assured relation, they cannot be here stated as the ones which Yonne trolled. Around him, as the reader might expect from a former relation of this Orpheus' powers, enwrapt by interchange of voice and instrument, crowded the whole issue of Sporus Vanderspeigl, a chubby-cheeked, open-mouthed troop of little white-headed, sunburnt varlets, who at times at the very top of their lungs, swelled the notes, or sprawled about the hearth half naked and filled with laughter; to these delectable sounds it must not be omitted to detail, were adjoined, as by way of variation, the snarling, barking, howling, and snapping of the Dutchman's dog, a long, hollow-backed, thin-gutted, shabby-coated, ill-natured house cur, that tantalized, as it dozed before the fire, by the restless feet and startling shouts of glee from the joyous children, seemed teased and goaded with venom and crossness nearly to bursting:—breaking into this riot of sounds at intervals, came the quick, sharp, and piercing voice of the goede vrouw herself, as she drew her hand away from the swift turning spinning wheel, which by the help of her active foot, was kept in constant motion, to shake it threateningly as she stilled the different complaints which, in spite of the prevailing good humour, were often preferred to her, or as she soundly saluted the ears of some little stiff-necked and obstinate delinquent or rebel to her sovereign authority, with a hearty cuff that made them tingle again, and which was returned by the bare-legged urchin with a fierce long screaming to the very stretch of his throat. Of the dame, it is almost needless to repeat, that about the Nederlander's precincts there was not a living thing but what cowered trembling at her slightest glance; few were more respected than the matron; she ruled over her domain, all paying unlimited obedience; did she command, a page flies not faster to a monarch's orders than did her subjects; the very cats ran affrighted to their couch in the oven when she spoke, and the anxious eyed and watchful rat coiled himself close in his nest in the cupboard, even the spider paused in fear and wonder at its laborious work along the rafters, as it listened to the echoes of her shrill tones. She was a tall, spare, meagre looking woman, with pale sharp features of the vinegar cast, all terribly pitted with the small pox, and enlivened with a pair of tartar twinkling little grey eyes, that, together with the puckered, pinched up mouth, appeared as sour as they well could be—she wore a chintz short gown covered with large red flowers, her petticoats, (on the number of which she prided herself,) were of a woollen stuff, interchangeably of blue, black, orange, and white hue; the outer one being uncommon short; from their edges, the various colours of the others that were under displayed themselves to advantage like the many dies of a rainbow; at each side of her hung a pocket, which, in size and dimensions, might be compared to moderate saddle bags, these were filled to the brim; thick blue yarn stockings, with clocks, and sharp pointed, broad bottomed, skate shaped shoes, with bright large silver buckles, covered her feet; on her head, she had a little round, puritanical kloeckminshie, or night cap, close crimped and stuck full of pins, needles, and other stray articles of that kind, which the saving dame had gathered from the floor in sweeping. The good woman was snugly seated at her wheel in a high backed, low bottomed, and leathern cushion chair, lustrous with wax and rubbing, curiously carved, and studded with numerous brass nails; and without doubt this chair was a magnificent thing of its kind, and had been an heir loom in mevrouws family time out of mind:—and if her statement could be depended on, and there is little cause to disbelieve her, it was a proof of the antiquity of her race; for she was one who had her whole genealogy by rote, and whatever might be thought, there were few who dared openly dispute her averments, that the aforesaid chair had belonged to her great aunt's fourth cousin's great uncle's grandfather, who had been den Hogen Mogendheid of Amsterdam in der Vaderland—and on such dignity, his descendant greatly plumed herself, and in consideration of which, it is currently reported, she was wont to hold her nose at the smallest computation, a foot higher than her husband, who, low-lived and wicked fellow, cared not a grain for all the ancestors in the world—and hard hearted wretch that he was, had no pride of family—so much so, that it was generally supposed he scarcely knew or troubled himself, whether he had ever had a grandfather. It must be allowed that in most cases, pride is a despicable feeling, but Vrouw Vanderspeigl had much to say in her defence, for as ornaments to the elbows of this same enen zeetel, were exquisitely chiselled two little pursy, round bodied, Dutch built cupids, with legs nearly as thick as their bodies, and curled full bottomed periwigs, and short squabby wings— each holding to his mouth a pipe which might have been meant for a trumpet, which the deities, by the prodigious swellings of their cheeks, for they were blown out like bladders, were straining to sound—and indeed when we hear of speeches on a walking stick, and the value set on an old cocked hat, who can blame the matron if these wooden dignitaries were the joy of her heart? they were in her mind superior to the finest sculpture that could be produced—the whole gallery of statuary might in vain have been offered for the tail of the bob wig of one of the puissant gods: she even affirmed that the schout himself, had not a seat in his council that could be compared with the one in question— and which she positively asserted had been publicly presented by the Stadt itself, to the worthy, her ancestor aforesaid, in reward for his being the greatest builder of his day, and his being a burgomaster—in which capacity she boasted he was accustomed to outsit all his fellows at a feast—a virtue now in extreme vogue among modern echevins, who make it an invariable rule to remain at table until they cannot stand. So having been induced, by this veneration in which he was held, I have hunted up with great research, the tradition and history of Mynheer Van Zwakborstig, as the worthy from whom Vrouw Yokupminshie was a lineal branch, was called—by which it appears, although nothing is known of his early life, except that he pursued diligently the careful craft of a timmerman or carpenter: yet in despite of the dame's statement, he was first brought into notice in the city of Nieuw Amsterdam, instead of the mother metropolis of that name—as usual in the great town with others, it had been with him—that the maxim used towards him, was not `what he had been,' but `what he was'—so the Mynheer got respect on account of his pocket, not of his manners—for the latter, as may be imagined, were not of the best—for it is confidently asserted, that he was a tough knot, and scarce could be planed: nevertheless he made out to plane most others with whom he dealt— for he amassed considerable shavings—so that in a short period after his first debut, he established himself in a stylish and blooming prieel at Schabakanica,[43] [43] This was the name by which the place, where the village of Greenwich now stands, was anciently known. but the more wealthy he grew, like most men so situated, the greater this rural character felt his consequence; and although Hopthe Von Beeftingh, the butcher, jeeringly said that the marrow bone of Van Zwakborstig's conceit ought to be knocked to splinters—yet as the person spoken of was a tall man, and warped in the shoulders, he made out to look down on such petty malice: so having conquered all things and opposers at home, Mynheer, who was not one to lay and rust like a nail, bethought him of an astonishing idea—no less than of making a visit to the Vaderland, for the sake of improvement, and being polished like a gentleman: so having petitioned the honourable and awful council of Antony Colve for permission, which was granted, to depart, with 12* the addition of that excellent warrior's giving Mynheer a military travelling title: (though by the by, he had never handled any weapon except a saw or a hammer:) he set out, and after a time returned so much edified and smoothed by his journey, that the whole colony was thrown in amazement: without denial, he was surprisingly altered—and it was astonishing to hear him tip his `daden,' that is, tell the marvellous adventures he encountered in Holland—how he had seen the great gloobs in the Stadt huis—and viewed the pictures of the naval fights of the De Witts, and many other wondrous things:—and above all how he rode a quarter of a mile upon a jackass, behind the Stadtholder's youngest son, who sought of the intelligent Van Zwakborstig sundry pertinent queries concerning the colony of Nieuw Nederlandts—such as if the moon shone at Nieuw Amsterdam as bright as at the Hague—whether the people were not a scalping set of savage brutes and baboons, of which last mentioned quadruped his high mightiness most condescendingly was pleased to remark he judged very favourably, on account of the specimen with whom he was conversing:—overwhelmed by which compliment, the Mynheer made the most lowly acknowledgment. And further he related that at a splendid service, whereat the new Prince of Orange was sworn in office, at the new kerk at Amsterdam, that through the favour of the afore-mentioned Heer he had an excellent seat near the grand organ, besides the satisfaction of looking vastly pompous, to the infinite mortification of Schepin Olisteen, who happened at the same period to be also in the Vaderland—and although a big man at home, he was in Mynheer's words, in Holland, “nien more den is vone hone dat you might wet your wit a dop on;”— but then what could be expected of a baker, for such had been Olisteen's trade—and poor devil that he was, he nearly got knocked down in attempting to smoke his pipe in the crowd. Van Zwakborstig had also many more glorious events that befell him which there is here no room to mention, but they can be found among the records of the stadt, in the same volume wherein is detailed the admirable voyage made by that famous navigator Hartz Kruger, to the “unknowne countrie of Madagascare;”[44] [44] Vide the early volumes of records in the Register's office in and for the city and county of New-York. for Mynheer had it all written down in a clear, legible and round Dutch text, by Dominie Megapolensis, that such an extremely interesting and accurate history should not be lost to posterity. Nevertheless, Mynheer did not bring only bare words back from his tour, for his return was accompanied by sundry chef d'œuvres of the Dutch artists, as is remembered to this day, from his unbounded liberality—for in the generosity of his heart he bestowed on the Stadt one Amsterdam Apollo without a nose, moulded at the lime kilns in Overyssel; a Venus, cut by Edric Vanderkunderspuke, without a leg; and a Cupid and Psyche without heads but of admirable form, the one being dressed in a field marshal's uniform and the other in a hoop and stomacher. Besides these, he robbed the old country for the benefit of the new, of a number of the finest engravings, as he himself said, in the world—together with the stoel which first introduced this account of him, and which had in reality belonged to the learned Professor Von Rospinygen, of Leyden; and on whose account Mynheer was admitted a member of most of the philosophical associations of the province; the principal of which is well known to have been der Knoflook und Vleesch club, that used every once a year to assemble at the sign of the Egg and Gridiron, near the Beaver Lick, to eat sour krout. Now, though it is in some wise advisable for all who wish to imitate the worthy just written of, to travel, and amuse themselves with the wonders of foreign parts—yet it must be confessed they too often forget their own native country, being filled with the virtues of others: and indeed such has been this evil, that scarce any of our witless and conceited coxcombs have stirred abroad, but what they have come back loaded with folly and pedantry —and in these there is no addition desired to our growth; for there are numbers among us who, crowded to the very throat with the mightiness of their own opinions, consider the judgment they deign to bestow on any subject whatever, (not caring how abstruse or beyond them it may be,) of that importance, that it is a final fiat which is to build or destroy its being and existence—for it is not more evident than remarkable, that the more vanity a man is possessed of, the more he is wanting in understanding—and the puerile and ignorant are always the most dogmatical; and indeed it is no wiseuncommon for some to insist on their pretensions to wisdom, and as the vacant skull of a fool has little difficulty in raising a throne to its own conceit, they can argue themselves and those who in capacity are their kindred in the same belief—for it is not unnatural for the simpleton and the idiot to worship each other. But while the relation of the goed vrouw's ancestor has led on to the remark just concluded, the poor neglected dame has waited our leisure with more patience than she would have waited that of her husband's. She has been eager this some time past, and ready to be formally acquainted with the reader had there been an opportunity; so it would not now be treating her as she ought to be, to keep her longer in suspense, for she was truly a personage of authority:—and she was surrounded by her subjects animate and inanimate—on her one side was the moveable cupboard of the Antwerp make, with its pannelled doors and brass handles, gorgeous with cleaning—on the other stood the slaubonk, serving the several purposes of a bed, table, and dresser, while all around the kitchen were marshalled hosts of pots, kettles, and cooking utensils of every shape and fashion. Here were barrels cut down into seats, such as are seen in the paintings of the Flemish masters—there were the earthen bowls of Long Island, which almost outdid even the Dutch manufactures themselves—and lastly, high up the chimney might be seen the blackened carcass of the green goose, that was smoking for the approaching New-Year, and whose delightful and delicate perfume filled the whole apartment; for however economy at other times might rule the domain of Mynheer Vanderspeigl, on the solemn feast of Sainte Claus he opened his soul and his heart; and surely he would not have had a drop of Dutch blood in his veins had it been otherwise. Nevertheless, ere the matron speaks, for after that there will be no chance, it must be premised that however strenuous mevrouw was in upholding the dignity of her Dutch extraction, she had somewhat deserted the ancient faith, having left the brief and steady homilies of Dominie Van Gieson attracted by the more powerful and spirit working holding forths of that sanctified, pure, holy and precious brother in truth and spirit, Mass Baregrace Trebletext; who, chosen appointed, and beloved vessel of the believing, had received a blessed call, to the infinite dissatisfaction, mortification, and disadvantage of the above named Dominie, all the way from Jericho and Babylon, where he was busied growing onions, to pour forth from his lank and lanthorn jaws, nasal and long winded denunciations against the carnal transgressions of the worldly minded backsliders of the Manahadoes. SECTION II. He is a soldier, or a man of art, lady, But shall have some great honour shortly. Pli. Brother, He's a rare man, believe me! Kas. Hold your peace. Here comes the t'other rare man. Save you, captain. —The Alchymist. The subject is proceeded in. “As I am a living woman, it is a dreadful night,”— quoth dame Yokupminshie, pausing at her occupation, and stopping for a moment the whirling course of the wheel at which she was employed, as she listened anxiously to the dreary and hollow sound of the angry wind that rushed by with flight swifter than the antelope, shaking the stout walls of the ferry house almost to their foundation, and driving the eddying smoke back from the chimney, so that in fleeting clouds it rolled among the beams and rafters of the apartment—while accompanying gouts of soot and wet lumps of dust and clay loosened and driven down from the crannies, dimmed for a moment, the clear and lively blaze of the ascending fire. “Sooth,” continued the matron, “the heaven is as dark as the storm and clouds can make it: and yet I aver, it compares not with the black evil and foul savouring courses of those who wallow in the mire of worldly sensuality and blindness: dear me, dear me! to think on the wickedness of the carnal creatures—the crying sins of man—dear me, dear me!” and she heaved from the bottom of her heart, a deep sigh, or rather groan, and clasping her hands across her bosom, she rolled her eyes upwards devoutly—“a murrain on thee, coistrel knave,” pursued Vrouw Vanderspeigl, starting from the meditation which she was about entering on, as a provoking flourish of Yonne's fiddle broke on her musings—her voice rising to its shrillest tone as she spoke, so that its sharp echoes pierced the farthest nook of the building— “a murrain on thee, saucy knave—with thy rioting and lewd canticles, one would believe you was at a boosing bout, rather than in the decent dwelling and tarrying place of a follower of the word: have done, for momently I expect the pleasant youth, brother Tribulation Wholesome, who is one that seeketh not the cares of the body, nor minds the tempest; seeing that he means to hold forth within our earthly tabernacle: so I enjoin you to silence, that I may hear his coming.” “Deare me, missee—lor pless you, ter moosic clebber 'nough, him make ony little noise,” returned Yonne in a deprecating tone, “dough Massa Boomelhyser preak ter tring at him Bee, but him berry nice fiddle vor all dat, sartain.” “Mercies on me!” said the matron, unattending to his expostulation, and casting her eyes round on her progeny, “what a set of imps; alack, if that cub, Stoffel, an't got his doublet out at his knee—yet it was but morn, that I patched it with the grey jerkin of his father: dear me, dear me, what a life one leads with them all—mend and work, even from the rise to the set of sun: troth there is not time wherewithal to commune on the health of the spirit, nor drive from the thoughts, with manifold taskings, the divers rank abominations and unclean profanations of the flesh, even as Deacon Zerubbabel Bare-bones rightly terms them, the temporal sins and vanities of the world.” “Ah now, mudder, do let Yonne play one more,” besought a chubby and shining faced urchin, in a coaxing voice. “Loramittee, let ter little ting hab him desire,” exclaimed the slave, backing a request which was consonant to his own wish, “ony missee hear me play ter tune, how der debbil come like a big neeger to old Moggepous, der great Jarmin docterdat lib at Bloomendael, 'fore him die, and askt ater him healt—ony tink now—massa Boomelhyser say him all trute, as me set dere—sartin.” “Nay, it behooves not me to listen to thy carnal melodies, lest it raise unholy and abominable ideas—the Lord preserve me—a woman to live with you all, should have the patience of Job: see, if that sweaty cheeked rogue, Coby, has not worn out his shoes already at the toes— dear me—the impudent varlet hath broken in twain the silver buckles which belonged to his maternal grandfather, Volkert Schepmoes, rest his soul! alack, Jekyl, dost think one has no ears? dear me, I shall be crazed; Tunesse, let go thy brother's hair—was there ever one so pestered—first here, then there—'tis sufficient to wear one to a skeleton: yet I have my trust, even as remarked the righteous elder Hopeful Clapp, when his crop of onions grew to seed and he lost thereby a portague: verily, I am resigned even unto this measure, since there cannot be a change thereof.” “Lor, me hear ter water roar at ter hell-gat, as plain as me see you—pless us, what a time is coming—ony listen—ter chimney crumbles as him plit,” said Yonne, and at the same time smoothing the rough coat of the disturbed animal reclining at his feet, he added, “still Snoocher—beast, hush ty tongue—Lor, vy der debbil you no be still?” “There is even a great gathering of the elements, and it moves me exceedingly for the coming of the absent Tribulation: stir up the fire, that he may abide here in warmth—and Yonne, get unto the pronk room, and take from the great chest the quilt that hath the Stadtholder's hunt thereon, worked by the hands of the respectable maiden Minstrie Snedigher, that was of kin to my godfather, who came from the Doele-straat of Amsterdam, having followed the reputable calling of baard schraper to the Dolen Huis—and mind, Yonne, that the best bed is aired, that the pious master Wholesome may have all that pertains to his comfort—and Yonne, take the new pair of striped blankets—and Yonne, tarry not long, for even as I speak, I hear some one approach,—dear me, it is not the step of the precious youth, but that of the brute, my husband: alack, how the sight of the man of sin disturbs me—for multitudinous are his ill doings—so that when I lay me by his side at night, my spirit is greatly moved that the wicked is near—and there appears unto me, that I look on the horned beast of the Revelations: mercies on me, Sporus, what have you been after—who is it Yonne says you've been talking with?” As she spoke, the door was roughly thrown open, and the Mienheer entered grumbling, growling, and swearing in notes as gruff and hoarse as a hungered bear, and ready to vent the gall which overflowed him on the first thing that came in his way; no sooner was his entrance effected than the bright eyes and ruddy cheeks of the children were dressed in smiles, as pure and innocent as those with which the summer flowers greet the dawn, while with glad cries they hailed his approach, and skipped forward with all the light hearted gaiety of sorrowless infancy to meet and welcome him, and hear the loved sounds of his well-known voice. Vanderspeigl was a harsh and selfish man, holding no sympathy for aught than that which furthered his own immediate enjoyment, and having no constitutional feelings except those of avarice and indolence, for like thousands who make up the great herd of mankind, his whole existence centered in his gold, and he prized the possession of wealth beyond all other earthly objects, and almost the goods to come; yet there was one fair trait in his character, it was a love for his children, and what heart, it may be inquired, however base or hard, is without that affection—and yet in the breast of human beings there are such:—to some, the dearest, fondest ties of kindred, the most sacred bonds of blood are as slight and feeble as a hair, and as easy to be broken; but such, though he wear a finer form, is but a monster, a brute, unfit to be ranked with the vilest of creation. What is more daily cried up as honourable and excellent than the love of family—do not men award it praise? but such incentives are needless, are superflous; that which is duty it is criminal to omit, but it shows how rare, even though it is so, that it is fulfilled, since it is so greatly lauded. Yet what parent, let him be cast in nature's coarsest mould, rough and uneducated, but must melt into womanish mildness when surrounded with his little ones and feeling their gentle endearments, when the soft warm cheek presses against his, wooing their roughness, and the weak, tender, and waxen arms twine for love and support about his neck, like the feeble vine of the honeysuckle about a towering column—or hears the delightful lispings, the wild and broken prattle, the music of their little lips, breathed on the parental bosom like the cooings of ring doves on the tree of life—indeed, one would suppose it beyond humanity not to delight in these. Men have been who spurned all ties that bound them to mankind, who have been as the savage panther watching the roaming elk, ready ever to spring, lacerate, and devour the very vitals of their fellow, and yet with a boundless devotion they have gloated even to adoration on their own offspring, and would, though selfish in all other respects, have perished piecemeal in tortures the most cruel and Vol. I. 13 rending, ere one moment's adversity should reach the objects of their worship—and still, so depraved are mankind, that there hath been the reverse of this: there are those who have from birth shunned and persecuted as an enemy the fruits of their bodies, have exposed them naked from infancy to the pitiless scorn and buffetings of the world, and have, rock-like, heard their cries for help; rolling in riches, they have bid them waste by famine, nor would stretch out the hand of relief;—yet worse than these hath there been, trampling on the rights of one child to exalt another, seeing one laid in the grave tearless for the inheritance of a favourite; but so often deals fate, that the one preferred is the instrument of vengeance in this life, as imitating, by force of example, the selfish feelings of the parent, the child turns the persecutor, for like the light on the flamingo's wing, which brightens but a moment and then is lost in the surrounding night, many times the kindnesses of nature which blaze in youth's spring tide are quenched and obliterated to apathy as they are tainted by the breath of society—and the care worn guardian of childhood receives for his countless anxieties and sacrifices, the withering coldness of ingratitude or desertion; so it is not uncommon to remark, that help in misfortune, balm to misery, and the outstretched hand of renovation is sooner extended and received from the stranger than the closest by name and blood. But the Nederlander was in no mood of love, his shaggy brows were contracted in a deep and surly frown, and appeared like dark clouds when swollen with a tempest; he took no notice of the children's jocund visages, but with a rude motion he dashed aside their outspread arms, and without answering his wife's questions he stalked sullenly to the fire and seated himself— “Got tam! sall Ik hab nien biece? nien, nien,” growled out the Dutchman, as the dame repeated her interrogatories, “op myn zeil! der sdorm ish in der huis mit dien tam taal, zo musch ash id is bueten duer, dats on der oudshide—vifers, vrouw, womans, Got tam! dunner and blixum, dou dinks der mensch hab niets do dink but dalk zo ash vone tam klok mit ids glapper.” “Mercies! what a taking the man's in,” quickly retorted the matron, the whole asperity of her composition filling her countenance with spite and sourness, for she was not one who was to be so spoken to with impunity, nor ever took one word without giving in return a dozen, or in other sense, without showing as good as was brought her. “A fine humour to be sure—you are not to be spoken with, I suppose; dear me, I did but task him with a word, and thus he turns upon me, showing the lowness of his breeding—truly did sister Hepzibah Praise-the-Lord, aver, at our last love-feast, that out of a dunghill one cannot expect a—” “Got tam, vrouw, stillen dien gerass,” crossly interrupted Vanderspeigl, “blesh mien hertz und batience! dis is nien genoeg; dat Ik has hish hondred beices sdole vrom der bogkets von his broeks, zo as hish zeil be blagued vrom hish bodies mit der tam voolish gesnater—dou duyvil's nikker, dake dat.” He addressed the last words enforced by a violent blow to the ears of one of the little urchins, who, with cautious and timid glances, had venturously approached within the reach of his hand; the varlet no sooner felt the injury, than with loud screams, enforced far beyond the extent of his hurt, he sought shelter in the arms of his mother, where experience on former occasions of the same kind, had taught the rogue that he was sure to receive more caresses than, in proportion to the ill-treatment of his father, he deserved, and which he was cunning enough to perceive was usually extended as much from direct opposition, and to irritate her spouse as from real concern. “A murrain on the man! he'd better snap one's head off —art crazed to beat poor Stoffel without cause,” exclaimed mevrouw, as she took the boy in her arms and stilled his sobs and cries; “hush, mind not his ill nature—dear me, he'll weep his heart out. You ungrateful man,” continued she, bouncing from her seat towards her helpmate, “was it to be treated thus I condescended to marry you, when I was well off in the world. Was not my father the schipper of a hoy that belonged to the great house of Mynheers Jan Jansen, Alperdam, Lunden, Vanderschroper &amp; Broders—did not my poor dear first husband that's dead and gone, Rip Van Schaik, leave me as comfortable a widow as any in Yorke—was not I far above you, you low, dirty wretch! when I married, you had scarce a rag on your back, and not a friend in the world—had I not a whole houseful of relations—and have I not had a first rate English education, from the worthy Baalim Snipe, who kept an academy in Queen-street—did I not prefer you, you unmindful and forgetful villain, to the precious pastor Habbakuk Alsermon, who, although he had but one eye and one leg, would have refreshed me with the good word and the outpourings of the spirit—doth not your conscience bespeak my wordly superiority, in which I take no pride, for pride is an abomination of the harlot that is throned on the seven hills—yet so I am repaid for my sacrifices by the rank and bitter waters of the cup of tribulation. Dear me! dear me! that my poor dear first man, Rip Van Schaick, was alive this day.” How much longer the incorrigible dame would have pursued her advantage, for her invectives seemed a never-exhausting weapon, and fell on the head of the offender in an unsparing flood—for she granted, being fairly set out, little or no quarter to her astounded spouse, who was deafened by the rapidity of her declamation and the sharpness of her thrusts—it is impossible to be ascertained; for words of reproach flew as swift to her tongue as she could utter them, and rendered no chance of her being pacified as long as she could speak: and how long that would be was difficult to conjecture, for every sentence seemed to come out with stronger emphasis and shriller voice—however relief came, unlooked for as sudden—as her attention, at the expression of the wish above narrated, was called to a loud knocking at the outer door of the ferry house. No sooner was the sound repeated, than the dog, who alarmed and affrighted at the violence of his mistress as she rated Mynheer, had crouched silently in a corner of the kitchen, and fearfully eyed the parties askance, sprang on his feet, and answered with loud and determined barkings the halloos of the disturbers. “Tish dey alrede—mien Got! zo zoon as vone weineg minnit!” cried the Dutchman starting up, “mien hondred bieces—ja—mien geldt—God tam, Snoocher, hond sdil dien blaffen,” and as he added the last words he gave the noisy animal a heavy blow with his foot in the ribs, that sent him across the floor, yelping, howling, and moaning piteously with pain. “Mercies on us! the man's mad, stark mad—you've killed the poor beast—here Snoocher, here,” said the wife, motioning the bruised creature to her; but the oft ill treated quadruped, cautious of her protection, and unaccustomed to the call of friendship from so questionable a quarter, only raised his head heavily at the sound, and crawled limping to the feet of Yonne, who at the moment returned from an inner chamber, where he had been preparing for the reception of the goodly Mass Tribulation Wholesome. The black soon soothed his dumb companion, who crouched in a heap, answered his caresses by whining affectionately as it looked in his face, and by licking gratefully the hand that patted his back. “Let the dog be, Yonne, and see who seeks entrance —I trow both the brute and thou art alike,” said dame Yokupminshie petulantly; “dear me, it must be the precious brother come at length. To him, Sporus, I will tell thy conduct, and put you to shame—mercies on us! if I mistake not there are more voices than one; God willing, the pious Hezekiah Holdfast, or some other of the brethren accompanies his righteous mission—therefore hasten and unclose the door; and Stoffel, put wood on the fire, that the good men may have cheer.” “Leib it staan, slaaf—zo as dou obensh it, op myn zeil, ik mill preak dien kop mit mien knokkles,” ejaculated Vanderspeigl, interposing with vehement action the motion of the negro, and thrusting his unwieldy form between Yonne and the door with an alertness of movement that his huge bulk scarce appeared capable of attaining, ja, dis is nien blace vor dem inkoomen—mien Got—ik ish verleizer vone hondred bieces alrede—ja.” “Who hath ever hearkened the like,” exclaimed the enraged matron, regarding him as though she could, in 13* the common phrase, eat him, “thou babel of iniquity— that beareth visible marks of the serpent, thy heart is like the Levites of old. What, wouldst thou detain the gifted Tribulation, and the reverend Hezekiah on the outside of the house in this storm? thou sinner—but thou shalt be stricken with a mighty mourning and repentance for these black indulgences of thy carnal mind against the faithful and elect; and manifold wailings and gnashings of teeth shall give testimony thereof Mind not the wordings of the Philistine, Yonne, but I bid thee unbar the door to the chosen of Israel.” “Dirty—fordy dousand duyvil—dis is vone verdamnt ding—ja, ik ish nien zo mush mashder in dis mien huis, zo as is mien negur, Got tam!” “A murrain on the black! why lingerest thou slave,” cried the vrouw, her eyes flashing with wrath and venom, and her natural shrillness of note increased almost to a scream, “will you not mind me? Negro, an in a minute thou dost not do my bid, I'll break every bone in thy black skin; and for him, let him stop you an he dares;” and she regarded Sporus with an Amazonian grin of ineffable contempt, and placed her arms a-kimbo. “Have I not made him a man, the ugly, dunghill born cur—but it is ever so in matching beneath one. Nevertheless, do you mind to do as I tell thee, or we'll see who's mistress.” Vanderspeigl gave no answer to this tirade that could reach the virago's hearing; but slowly and reluctantly withdrawing himself from before Yonne, he regarded his gentle helpmate with a grim visage, expressive of rage and stifled hate—and from the bottom of his lungs he sent forth a deep growl, or rather a revengeful grunt of displeasure and gall; and at the same time giving way to the abusive violence of the termagant, he sheepishly hung his head with an awkward air of submission, and thrusting his hand into his breeches, he drew forth a large clumsy iron tobacco pouch, curiously figured and decorated, and taking from its interior a considerable portion of its contents, he filled one side of his mouth with an enormous piece of the spleen dispelling herb; and on which, from the earnestness with which he seemed to attack it, he appeared to vent all his disappointment and venom—for his countenance quickly expelling its rueful elongation, looked as clear, stolid and unmoveable, as though nothing whatever had intervened to disturb his quietude. In the meanwhile poor Yonne, perplexed and awe struck, and scarce knowing which party to obey or which way to turn, for he had his Scylla and Charybdis on either side, cast fearful, hesitating, and doubtful glances from one to the other: however, perceiving the dame's cheek flushed and her eye lighten towards him like a fiery meteor, as she addressed her rhapsody to his alarmed ears, and aroused by his master's equanimity lest she should be tempted to turn the irresistible torrent of her expostulations and wrath altogether on his head, and being also well satisfied as to the general issue of such matrimonial conflicts, he opined and proceeded as best for his own security, though with a cunning appearance of reluctance, to unclose the entrance; but here a serious disappointment awaited the eager and expectant matron—two persons indeed presented themselves for admittance, but they were neither the precious Tribulation, nor his co-mate Hezekiah, nor, by their garb and appearance, followers of the word: dame Yokupminshie, whose hospitality and charity was of a careful kind, and seldom or ever without good reasons or weighty inducements, extended farther than towards her own immediate sect, as it was her firm belief that all the rest of the world were a set of graceless sinners, for whom there was no redemption—that is literally, they all deserved to be damned to all eternity; and as the quality of the strangers was not easily to be perceived, for both were enveloped from head to foot in large mantles, which were loaded with snow and dripping with water from every fold, and which entirely concealed their figures—she therefore fell back several steps, while her countenance underwent an instantaneous change from every expression of welcome that had for a time taken possession of her sharp and skinny features, to that of the utmost forbidding ill will and morose selfishness—and it was extremely probable, from the glances which she cast on them, whether, if already they had not entered the door, they would have been able to have made a shelter in the house at all. “We are loth and sorry to disturb or incommode you, honest friends,” quoth the foremost, shaking the damp from his cloak, and addressing both the Dutchman and his wife, as with surprise, he perceived neither advanced to greet him—for while Vanderspeigl stood aloof in sullen silence, his spouse, who had at first sprang so eagerly forward to receive her expected co-religionists, had now petulantly retreated towards her spinning-wheel, and almost turned her back on the persons whose presence had so grievously disappointed her wishes—“we are strangers,” continued he, “just landed from the ocean; our vessel lying in the sound, and unable to make a safe anchorage till light—but being desirous of reaching the city, if possible, we have sought your hostel, that we may obtain warmth for our almost frozen limbs, and guidance on our way.” “And what may your name be, and what is your business?” demanded mevrouw, turning suddenly round, and viewing him strictly with the pert gaze of impudent curiosity. “I deem that, good woman, entirely foreign to my request, and unnecessary for your satisfaction,” returned the intruder haughtily—and then moving from her, he beckoned particularly to Vanderspeigl, who appeared solely and assiduously occupied in rolling the tobacco from one side of his mouth to the other, in such a manner, that two liquid streams of juice voided themselves over his lips, and coursed down at each side of his chin; “probably from you, master,” pursued he, “I may obtain more to the purpose—speak out! can we have that which we seek—a guide and temporary refreshment from the fierceness of the tempest?” Vanderspeigl, however, gave no reply, but continued his amusement, only raising his eyes with a vacant, dull look to the speaker's face, and then casting them referringly to his wife, who, with every muscle of visage contracted to a more disagreeable aspect, prepared to vent her spleen and anger at the rebuff she had received—“Good woman, forsooth! mercies on us! good woman!” broke from her lips—“I'd have you to know”—here, however, the threatening storm was prevented from bursting, by the interference of the companion of him who had offended, and who appeared considerably the elder of the two.” “Now, by my halidome, thou art wrong Hal, to bear thee thus: leave them to me—an I do not correct the outline, call me the botch of a dauber,” cried he to the first, as he pushed forward a jolly, red, round, good humoured and staring countenance, smirking with smiles, which an endeavour at gravity, could not disguise to seriousness, and speaking quickly, as impatient at having been so long in the back ground—“I beseech thee listen to our modest asking, honest gentle folks—kind, good people—by the by, the woman has a most admirable head, a study for a Rembrandt—I'll have a sketch of it, by Saint Paul! You see we want nothing but what we can pay for; and gad, if you say it, I'll draw your lovely likeness in the bargain—and Hal, you know that would'nt be aught beneath the art, either; for Caravagio, an you recollect, painted a tavern sign for his breakfast.” And at the same time, he advanced boldly towards the matron with a formal obeisance, and drew forth a purse apparently well lined—in the performance of which action, he threw back the outer garment in which he had been wrapt, and discovered a large, thick-set, broad shouldered, clumsy shaped personage, considerably inclined to corpulency—whose appearance was not a little displayed by the splendour of his equipments, which were not lost on the attentive Vanderspeigl, and the now admiring and observant eye of mevrouw: his dress was a light coloured embroidered loose coat, made low in the neck, with immense tails and cuffs, of such a size that they hung at least a half a yard below the hand, which last was encircled by a treble row of the finest Flanders lace—his waistcoat was superbly barred, and worked and ornamented with large and glittering buttons, with wide flaps in front, that extended nearly down to the knee, in the style of the true court gallant of the day: he also wore a small gold laced, three squared, or cocked hat, that sat perched like a yellow bird on the top of a large flaxen periwig—whose fine and graceful flowing curls, rolled in profusion below the shoulders, but divided most carefully in front, that the full rotundity of the wearer's visage might have sufficient space to show itself; a thin walking rapier hugged his side, and although a huge pair of travelling jack-boots of the greatest dimensions, whose very tops hung loose from their magnitude round the calf, that they appeared like an open umbrella reversed and standing on the ferule, cased his legs—yet the silk stockings, and the garters, deep fringed with silver, were plainly to be perceived. There is probably, nothing that can command more respect, than a fine dress and a show of means, well seasoned with assurance: a ragged, slovenly, out at the elbow sort of a chap, or one of your modest, gentlemanly, unassuming gentry, will pass unnoticed; yet they may be able and willing to call for and discharge all debts incurred—while a grass-hopping mushroom, just freed from his master's counter, who flings his purse and oath at the same time in your face, may with impunity insult every woman he meets, run over the children, damn the waiters, and cheat their masters, and still have every attention paid him even in the places where he is most known—for a dashing, roaring blade, meets always an excuse, when an honest man would have utterly lost his character: whether convinced of the certainty of this conclusion, or transfixed by the rapidity of speech, pomp of attire, and the rattle and glitter of the shining ore held in view, or whether the strong argument of the stranger's address, was the inducement, for it seemed likely from the curtsey dropped on a sudden by the relenting dame, that she understood it as an entire compliment to herself; yet it was equally apparent, that no sooner was the broad piece presented by the thumb and forefinger of the speaker, than Sporus, as if at that very instant he had awakened from a lethargy, or shook the binding and dreamy cobwebs of sleep from his eyes, started from his apathy and pushed himself forward, with an outstretched hand that seemed envious of the sordid bait, that he might grasp it into instant possession; while athwart his heavy countenance there flitted a grin of pleasure and selfish delight, as he eyed the gold, which doubtless he intended for a smile of open hearted hospitality, and gracious repayment for the money: indeed it was of that species,—a glance which might have been given in return to the maker of a feast, for all his fine dishes—and which expressed in language stronger than utterance frames, the grateful maxim, `fools make feasts, but wise men eat them;' or rather, that the reader may more forcibly comprehend the sagacity of Vanderspeigl's look, if he hath a wife who attends those springes to catch idiots, termed ladies auctions, only let him recall to mind the ineffable leer of satisfaction with which the auctioneer repays him, when he lays down the amount of a long list of cheap articles `almost as good as new, and worth as much again as has been bid for them,' and which speaks to the utmost, that `the ass and his money hath soon parted,' and he will have the whole expression of the sturdy Hollander's countenance before him; but the proverb, though somewhat musty, carries considerable truth, `there is many a slip between the cup and the lip,' and here it was verified—for unfortunately at this momentous period, by some unaccountable caprice of fate, the ferrymaster's evil star reigned in the ascendant, for ere he was able to take due distance towards the object of his longing desires,—even in the very instant it appeared within his gripe, he had all but clutched it, when his wife (and indeed such women will interfere in every thing) hastily stepped forward—(for it is above observed, the brave garb and clinking purse of the stranger had made an impression, and had an effect at once ludicrous and singular on mevrouw, and proved that the mammon of lucre found an equal savour in her sight, as in that of Mienheer's, and therefore to her first courtesies, she added a second lowly inclination of body,) taking, however, a due precaution in the enaction, to receive the magnet of attraction in her own hand, which she was careful should be opened for that express purpose: this no sooner done, than with the greatest precision, and the nicest accuracy, this worthy better half of the prudent Nederlander, deposited it in her pocket,—while alas, the misadventures of that unlucky wight, Sporus Vanderspeigl, ended not here—for in his over anxiety to attain his point, and in the procedure abandoning his used and wonted caution, by an unguarded movement, he unfortunately struck his foot against the end of his wife's spinning wheel—and before he was well able to recover from the shock of such an encounter, and hold his accustomed equilibrium, (as from the velocity of his motion, his head and feet would have given an apt explanation of the extreme points of an angle;) and in order to regain his proper balance by way of an assistance, though probably without ill intention, for a falling and drowning man, alike will catch at a straw for safety, he struck his broad palm forcibly against the head of little Stoffel, who, by the by, was the very image of his father in bib and tucker, and who, poor varlet, was gazing with distended eyes, stretched like saucers by curiosity on the new comers, entirely unconscious, and by no means dreaming of so rough a salute. The boy flew screaming in one direction—the wheel, the cause of all the disturbance, took another—while the ferrymaster, partaking in his own body somewhat of the properties of a Dutch herring buss, (which are shaped considerably like a basin, and are therefore proof against sinking,) regained his footing after a clumsy struggle, which he closed with a hearty oath, that with an irresistible force sprang from his throat as if urged by circumstance, to follow in the immediate train of the words of welcome that had just preceded his direful mishap: still there is much doubt, whether the alertness of his rib had not in part the power of mingling more than common bitterness with the rising phlegm that produced the exclamation, “Mien Got—dis dam ding is altyd in der weg—op myn zeil! Ik hash proke mien scheenbien wid der tam sbiening weil—ja—mien Got!” For indubitably, it is a very mistaken idea, that supposes man and wife are one— and that all which belong to them are in unison— and that the notion is unfounded, no one was more thoroughly convinced of than Vanderspeigl, for though he and his cara sposa rested on one couch, and dwelt under one roof, they had two very separate customs as to many other material matters—and they were divided like most married couples, particularly in their money affairs; for although they both held to the plan of hoarding it, yet it was in different portions:— that of mevrouw's, to the grievous dissatisfaction of mynheer, being most sacred, and seldom gratifying his view. Still, nevertheless, ill nature reported, and what will not ill nature report, that it oftentimes gladdened the sight of the precious brother Wholesome. However, if this affirmance hath any truth in it, all evil suggestions shall be disappointed; for there can be no hesitation in asserting that it must have been exhibited for pious and righteous purposes alone, judging by the extraordinary value set on it by the matron. “Mercies on us, how awkward to throw down the wheel,” said the dame peevishly; “and you brat, still your noise—I'll warrant no bones broken. Sweet master, he always bawls thus when least injured,” continued the mother, as the younger stranger lifted the child from the floor; “the heedless goose is ever thrusting his nose where it should not be. Why dost not stir about,” added she, moving smartly on Yonne, who like his young master had been lost in admiration at the splendour and fashion of the stranger's garments, “see you not that the gentry stand while you dangle your fingers idly before you. Dear me! Koby get from the fire, hast no more manners than the prophet's ass. Alack, my good cavaliers, excuse these creatures—why Sporus man, beast! must I do all, as did Gideon of old in the Scripture— prithee move thy stumps a bit.” And thus did mevrouw show off her hospitality, buzzing about like a fly round a candle light; eager, teasing, and pressing; endeavouring by her present activity to erase the remembrance of her first lack of courtesy. A Vol. I. 14 sudden change seemed to have come to her nature, and she was now a true semblance of Dutch virtue, generous and disinterested—though it may be that at times against her very will, her wandering thoughts (for such it is impossible to control) ran sadly in divers abstruse calculations in how great a degree the stranger's purse could bear diminishing; and as one idea is often apt to keep pace with another, as naturally as a bird follows its flock, and we are accustomed to look to the very extent of a pleasant prospect, so did the goede joffrouw's mind (for in spite of the battlings with the spirit, she had her carnal periods of human weakness and visitation and of which, at task meetings she bitterly complained;) pursue the subject to its farthest source, and she even believed it probable, if events turned out as she expected, that she could afford to appear abroad in a new fardel or vandyke, or at least with a handsome tasbeetel, that would make the envious Vrouw Clopper sick with coveting. Therefore it may be well supposed that her guests were scarcely seated, ere thus urged she made the top of the slaubonk groan with the enticing contents of her larder—while her thrifty husband gazed in wonder and affright at her prodigality; —for indeed she did nothing by halves, when the whim once actuated her. There was the last made crulershie shining again with the fat in which they had been cooked, and towering like an Egyptian pyramid from the wide earthen dish—there was the milk-white hominy and the speckled sackatas, cookery peculiar to the new world, and unknown to the kokwinkles and estaminets of Vaderland, loading and overflowing the clean wooden bowls that held them, and flanked by huge flagons of molasses—and again, there was the shattered remains of the last meal, thick and greasy slices of smoked ham fried brown, with the gelid gravy clinging to them like the snowy foam of the wave frozen upon an ocean rock—there was the partly demolished dough nuts, the delight of children,—and also the small round Holland saucers of preserved peaches and cold baked pears, filled to the very brims with their delicious liquors—and then, to wash down this feast, came the mighty family porringers of Delft make, chased proudly with broad, laughing bacchantes, and short pug-nosed satyrs and clumsy fauns, sporting without, and mantling brightly with sweet flavoured cider within—while the whole was crowned with long necked, squat, green glass pottles, bursting with the rich juice of the gooseberry and the golden genever, and supported by tall, thin, thimble cupped Flemish glasses; a parade of viands fit for the banquet of a burgomaster. “Gezondheid,” exclaimed Mynheer as he filled a cup, and in one draught swallowed the greater portion of its contents and held the residue before the light, at the same time smacking his lips loudly, “op myn zeil, Mynheers, dats der drue stduff—mien God! it flikkers more zo as vone weineg ligt der zon—blesh mien hertz—tish goede, tish der regt ding vor zoopje;—gezonheid.” Although the ferry master thus graciously began to do the honours of his table, and appeared cheerfully to assent to the designs of his wife from the very bottom of his soul, yet every mouthful that disappeared before the hungry lips of his sharp set guests, seemed in his eyes like drawing blood from his vitals; but he was forced to take the part he was acting—for there is no disputing, that which cannot be mended should be endured with as good a grace as can be mustered from necessity—yet it went exceedingly against the grain, as he was truly, (as the reader must remember,) one of those sparing and economical creatures who are enabled by dint of a discreet careful, and somewhat ingenious management, to prevent every thing like waste or profuseness, and who can show the worth of a little by making it serve for a great deal— and it therefore grieved him mightily, and he waxed wroth within himself at the uncommon, unnatural, and unfeeling want of reflection of the huismoeder's at one time placing such a bountiful and sumptuous entertainment before such a couple of unmerciful and unsparing stomachs, (as in his own mind, before they fell to work,) he had determined were possessed by the strangers—and from this, as of course his idea was strengthened that every mouthful they devoured was more than sufficient to have served any moderate and reasonable man with satisfaction and support for the animal frame, for at least a month. Indeed it is necessary to mention that no one could have been more surprised, and even struck aghast with amazement, than he was at the very production of the banquet—for like the water that sprung at the stroke of the lawgiver's rod, it was as though it had flowed from the barren rock; he could not recall, though he was conscious he never burthened his memory too much, that his helpmate had told him of there being such a various and great quantity of provisions laid by in the house. It is true he recognised numerous scraps which had in their time formed parts of his meals, yet it strangely ran in his recollection, that mevrouw had assured him that they had all been devoured; and so to see them start in being direfully puzzled him—but all was the fault of his narrow mind— he did not for a moment dream that the matron had generously from each particular service set apart a choice bit, culled out by her own delicate hand, for the taste and approbation of the gifted man Hezekiah, for the pouring forth of the word was attended with much bodily labour and mighty sweatings and strainings of the jaws, and help and refreshment of strength necessarily was obtained from the good fare which was always provided for him when his coming was known; and which he enjoyed while the Dutchman snored, little believing his high prized and precious stores where gliding down the throat of the worthy brother. However the presence of the travellers had for a while entirely obliterated from Vrouw Vanderspeigl's thoughts, the expected visit for this night, and the share of the neglected Tribulation was marshalled out for the attack of the voracious mouths of those who seemed to threaten to leave but little for his temporal comfort.— This is an ungrateful world—sacrifices, benefits, favours and friendship can at will be shifted off and forgotten— there are but few who are not of that light and fickle kind who will call to memory an absent acquaintance if they find it serve a minute's interest to do otherwise: unconscious Wholesome, little did he suppose the ill that was done him as he trudged heartily towards the mansion, his hollow bowels yearning with expectation. But as to Sporus, who having carefully considered the matter, came to a mental determination, that there ought to be enough left from the feast for the support of his family for a week, after his guests were satisfied—yet for the dame's conduct he felt some anxiety; and it was only the awe in which he held her expostulations, that prevented him from making up his mind to act a prudent part: as a due reflection on her profusion seemed to absolutely demand his speaking to the croyer of the neighbourhood, that he might, after the example of an honest Dutchman of the vicinity called Yokup Van Solingen, who for a doit got clear of many destructive contracts, by hiring Gottlieb Klokspolenswartz, the little Schieldterberg croyer (at least a half year after the goods which had been got were safe housed, though a few days before the bills came in,) to proclaim three times before the whipping-post which stood in Duke-street, the following lawful notice: “O yez, O yez! dis is dat givesh notish do all manners von bersons dat sdands do hear dis broklomashin—and dose dat never hears him at all—dat whozoeversh has drushd zo ash a vool, der vrauw von Yokup Van Solingen, der dater ob Hauns Swagger, widout her mensche's bermission,—u must zee how u kits u monies. O yez, O yez!”—words which were brought out with sundry guttural flourishes, from the harmonious and clear throat of the strong lunged Gottleib, who, at the beginning and conclusion, rang manfully a bell, which he had in his hand, and which had a very moving effect— particularly on the faces and pockets of the creditors, who were forced, like all persons in such a predicament, to philosophize, and content themselves that they had no business to trust, and therefore their loss was of their own seeking, and it behoved them to make up for it by cheating the first persons that next dealt with them; for, after all, Yokup was an extraordinary honest character; but, poor fellow, he had a wife that, with all his care, would certainly ruin him. Violently stirred by these disturbing cogitations, the gray, envious eyes of Vanderspeigl, shot continually eager, greedy, and begrudging glances, as with silent celerity mighty portions of the victuals disappeared; with close investigation, he seemed 14* to strive to measure the very quantity of each separate piece that was swallowed, and which almost fearfully dilated in magnitude as he watched its progress to the lips—for he believed that every scrap that was spared was an addition to his wealth; and truly, few could practice as well as Sporus the difficult custom of frugality, which however despised, is one of the surest means of prosperity; for hath it not been, that the saving of the most insignificant articles, the very preserving of the blank parts of his correspondents' epistles, have been an accumulation of profit to many an honest Dutch trader? and on a like principle Vanderspeigl considered that he was equally entitled to a handsome return from the persons entertained as on the present, had his wife set before them the common fare which supported his family—a broad dish of mush, rendered palatable on extra days, (such as the anniversary of Binke's Conquest of the Colony, or the Stadtholder's birthday,) with the juice of the maple tree, together with a few hard coarse cakes, known by the name of journey cakes. Although to this inviting feast in this instance, he deemed it possible, in consequence of the appearance of the company, he might have ventured without much loss, to add a taste from one of the long slender flemish goblets that is above mentioned—and which he never allowed to be brought out except on extraordinary occasion, such as the festival of St. Nicholas—of his best Hollandts, a liquor, which on the great day just cited, he was first accustomed himself to take down in one gulp, nearly three quarters of the contents of the glass which he filled, and then after sundry expressive smacks of his lips, he would pass it to his wife, who having also done it justice, directed its course, (if any remained in the vial) alternately through the family, till its career was ended in Yonne's pouring a certain sufficiency of water to the rinsing and drops, that cleaving to the bottom, had escaped the thirsty tongues of his superiors—the procedure of the black being followed by a shower of charges from his provident owner, advising him not to take the liquor strong, lest it should get in his head, or rather noddle, as Vrouw Yokupminshie familiarly named it. All these ceremonies having been fully concluded, and the form and quality of the glass itself thoroughly examined and admired, for it had been imported from Flushing, and was known to be of the real Scheiverland blowing,—with great precaution in the fingering, it was cleansed, wiped dry, and safely deposited in the cupboard, until it should again be brought forward to the light by some other extraordinary event. From what has been stated, no doubt it has been foreseen that it was with more than an ordinary degree of satisfaction, that our Nederlander perceived his guests finish their repast without suffering their hunger totally to demolish as much as his views, which were singularly distended on the occasion, had first comprehended; for in this case he had looked on the darkest side, and at times, so hopeless had appeared the prospect, that he had already deemed it fortunate, were the clingings of the dishes spared. “Wel moet het u bekoomen Mienheers,” quoth the Hollander at length in a joyous tone, as the strangers turned from the table, though somewhat damped in his pleasure, by the movements of the elder guest, whose eyes still strayed towards the half destroyed meal, as though doubtful whether he had eaten sufficient while so much was left still to be devoured, “wel moet het u bekoomen Mienheers,” repeated he with a clumsy courtesy, to which the persons addressed made suitable return. “It is a miserable storm to encounter, and without doubt a dreary road we have to traverse,” said the younger traveller, “and comrade, the time wears apace; but I trow an we linger, day will surprise us ere our journey be finished—sooth, the wind seems to my ear to have lost half its rage—what say you—belike it were as well we do resume our way?” “Now by the skill of Claude, thou art out of keeping, cavalier,” replied his companion, “at an hour like this to fly the free quarters of ease and safety, to madly breast the tempest—and here is a scene that Teniers might envy and Ostade seek to paint, cast as it were by design itself in my way—by the fame of Durer, I'll not budge one jot until I've taken down the group—troth, who knows but the interior of a Dutch cottage, by your humble servant Jost Stoll, of Kakiat, may one day rank with the masterpieces of him of Nuremburg?” “Thou art ever too uncurbed for caution,” returned the other seriously, “for rashly, in spite of situation, by want of guard thou temptest danger; you do forget your place and duty, sir, thus idly to run out upon a theme more fit for leisure hours—bethink, this is a time that doth demand a secret lip and sterner action.” “On my troth this might have been spared,” answered the second, “wherein have I disposed me wrong? you should know I am no awkward boy at the crayon— had I been so, I had never had the honour of kissing the hand of his sacred Majesty William, at—” “What boots the reflection now,” said the first hastily, and in a sharp tone, interrupting him, “does this uncalled disclosure serve the king, or perfect the service on which we are dispatched? let me beg at least, if not command you, to restrain this feeling that urges you so simply to betray those things, which for every cause at present, should be hid—my report of a repetition, sir, might not forward your favour at home.” The person rebuked hesitated a moment, but checked the reply that hung on his tongue, and drawing his seat close to the light, he drew his tablets from his pocket, and glancing minutely round the apartment, he appeared busied in transferring the form of its contents on the vellum. “We must further trespass on your kidness, host,” continued the first stranger, addressing Vanderspeigl, “it behooves us to reach the city as soon as we can perform the task—and if by the procurement of horses to bear us thither, and an accompanying guide, you will contribute to the speedy effecting of our intention of travel—thy beasts shall neither lack provender, nor their owner reward—how say you, master?” “Blesh mien zeil! dis nagt do der Stadt,” said Sporus, amazed, and shaking his head with a rueful gesture, at what seemed to him the madness of proposal, “mien Got —dis ish more dan zo mush as vone ding op den myl—bresarve mien kop! Ik dakes callen tyden dree—ja—mores as dree dag reizen—den Ik sdops zo littles as dwice at Notchie Vermilyea—dat is do light myn byp, and dake enen zoopje, dat Ik may drive myn paard mit sbirit— mien Got—dis is drue as mien hertz is in mien bodies— mien Got!” “Three days to go ten miles—by the classic brush of Van Tulden, a great stretch of canvass,” exclaimed the elder guest, pausing and looking up from his employment, “master, hold thy head a little a one side, that the strong shadow may rest on thy nose—the other way— there, the broad light suits the expression—admirable— admirable!—a beautiful mezzotint, by the freedom of Adrian Brouwer.” The Hollander gazed at the speaker in astonishment. “Whatever difficulties are to be met, they must be overcome; to us danger will be no detention,” pursued the first—“come, to the point—can we obtain the horses required? I repeat again, you shall not repent our payment for any alacrity you exert to oblige us.” “Horsh—paard! goot Got—dat u zay,” said the Nederlander twisting his countenance to its most lugubrious aspect, “u dinks Ik hab dwo—dree paard—op mien zeil, dere is no mores dan vone boor ding von merrie—ja—geschoeid on no mores dan dree op his voet—bresarve mien bodies—he'sh losht al der wind dat's in him, zo as he bulls mit der ploeg—mien Got! hersh de vrouw mit her tam nonzensh—Got tam!” “Dear me, dear me! what a creature you are,” said vrouw Yockupminshie, interposing after an uncommon length of silence on her part, which can only be accounted for by her having been busied in superintending Yonne's removal of the remnants of the meal that had been set before the travellers; but having caught a portion of what was passing, and finding her spouse seem strangely backward, inattentive probably, from fears of his precious person, which alone he valued above his gain, she pushed forward determined to use her authority in perfecting the seeking of the guests— “mercies on us,” said she, “thy heart, Sporus, is like unto a cage which is filled with unclean birds, as the goodly master Trebletext says of the heathen—Yonne, take care you do not crack that jar—thou art as blind to all things, as were the deluded men of Babylon unto the words of the prophet—was there ever such a lazy black serpent—how he moves—believest thou not if you try, these gallants can be accommodated? they may ride thy nag at least, unto the man Vermilyea's drinking house, where they can get others—see there, Yonne, how you drop the grease—the bricks were scrubbed and sanded this morning—dear me!—an they can do no better, they can ride and tie, as did the worthy brethren Nehemiah Adams, and Zachariah Canter, who rode unto this wilderness in the glory of the Lord, on one steed, from Waterford—having nothing in their saddlebags whereon to subsist, but a dozen onions and some butter milk cream—ah me, the trials of the faithful—and thou, dumb dog, hearkenest thou not that you will have a fair return for the usage of the animal?” “Don't make such wry and woeful faces man, I shall never be able to catch your likeness—by my halidome I shall make you as mean a figure as that in the hundred guilders print of Rembrandt: hold still, by the cartoons, that's the very position—what noble shadows; the hand of a Pietro Longo is wanting, it is beyond Jost Stoll,” said the elder, enwrapt with the drawing at which he was evidently employed. The children had slowly, as their awe of the stranger decreased, by perceiving him engaged at something which they were unable to comprehend, but which aroused their curiosity, crowded round him, and now being unrepulsed, with eager sight glanced over his shoulders. “What do you think of that my little man—what does it look like? You have the eye of a painter, you rogue; I see you like it—what a pity it is you know nothing about tints, composition, rules, manner, effect, air, and freedom; but you are an amateur, you young dog, I see it by your look,” and with all the self delight, and satisfied admiration imaginable, he held up his tablet to the gaze of one of the little urchins, first close, and then further and further, and at last at arms length. “There's correctness of outline—there's picturesque grace—there's a group—don't talk of Vosterman, of Hemskirk, of Hollar, or Bloemart, while—who the devil's this? something for the back ground; all it wanted, by the slovenliness of Vander-Kabel”— “Mercies on me! here comes likewise one,” said the matron, “who will lend his mite to those in need, even his beast of burthen, doubtless, for a proper and reasonable recompense. Thou art truly welcome unto my tabernacle, brother Tribulation Wholesome!” As she spoke, the door which had been left unbarred since the travellers' arrival, was gently opened with one of those conscious timid pushes, which bespeaks the character of the mover, and the vacancy that was left, was immediately filled, and the sight of all present greeted by the remarkable person of the righteous young man yclept Tribulation Wholesome, who meekly entered. This worthy was a thin, gaunt, lank, spare, raw-boned anatomy of a man, so tall that his head, as if from a secret feeling of awkwardness in height, projected forward several inches before his body, like the upper beam or arm in the ancient erection of a gallows; but so low was the Dutch ceiling of the ferry house, or rather the bare rafters of the Nederlander's kitchen, that in spite of this unnatural inclination, his skull came at intervals incautiously in contact with them. He possessed a long hollow-cheeked visage, through the dry parchment hued covering of which, every motion of his wide and alligator-like jaw was plainly perceptible; the colour of his skin was pale, and nearly approached to the dye of the mahogany, his nose excepted, which, probably by way of ornament, hung out in shape of a pot hook, and was tastefully studded by sundry precious purple and blood red carbuncles to the utmost end, that outvied the eminent lustre of the claret tint which pervaded the rest of this excellent appendage of the human features; in brief, it must be admitted, there was not much novelty in the object, for our paths are full of vessels of the like kind, and which is more commonly known to the spectator by the designation of a brandy nose, or one blooming with rum blossoms; yet be not reader inclined by this evidence, for the pious and abstemious Tribulation never drank aught stronger than water, at least so his own lips bore testimony. Now be that as it may, all assent to the truth of the maxim, `a good nose is worth a kingdom,' as is here proved, for being weak of eye, the said primary portion of the countenance served to support and uplift unto the assistance of the secondary planets a huge pair of leather bound green goggles, through which his red and ferret orbs twinkled in all the pomp of certain wisdom;—and indeed the custom of wearing glasses looks wonderfully learned and studious, and in these times is much followed, particularly by ladies, who wish to be supposed extensive readers, and therefore mount them whenever they can be seen, and also by youngsters, who believe they give them a scientific appearance, and shows at any rate that they have read all the late novels, in which the whole literature of the present day consists; indeed, when one has read the wretched scraps of nonsense collected in the pages of a journal, and skimmed over the watery and fulsome leaves of the last new tale, in his own opinion his education as a critic and a man of letters is completed; and every ruffled fopling and hollow blockhead thus armed, sets himself up as an oracle, whose judgment is definitive and not to be disputed—but to proceed in the description, in which wrong will be done if a due chance is not given to the amiable person of Master Wholesome, a superiority to whom few could boast, as even his mouth was a model for a statuary, for when opened it presented to the inquiring view, a species of forest, where trees, trunks, bramble bushes and rocks, flourish in rich luxuriance, for it was laid out, or rather irregularly lined with a row of large black stumps and putrid broken teeth, which, from their relative situation with each other, appeared somewhat like a scattered and unarranged crowd in earnest conversation, and over which at times floated a zephyr, not sweet as musk above the bulbul's nest, but somewhat like a breeze of garlic over a bed of assafœtida. His stilt-like legs were half-enveloped in a rusty, greasy, leathern doublet, which was so tight to the body that the slightest stirring of the muscles was visible, and the remainder was cased in a covering of blue yarn hose, thickly spotted, to the exclusion of its original hue, with divers party coloured darns, and withal, worn in mighty holes in sundry places—but the flesh of the wearer, although seen through these unlucky gaps, probably from the pinching severity of the cold, could scarcely be recognized rom the garment in colour. His outer dress was a large loose cloth jerkin, worn extremely threadbare, and seeming, from its shortness of length and width of body, remarkably adapted for a small, squabby, hogshead built character, and in no wise fitting for the gainly and comely form of Tribulation—who, had he condescended to wear a linen garment, but in which article of comfort, it was reported that his wardrobe was singularly deficient and scant, it is likely from the numerous ruptures in the jerkin just mentioned, some stray perspectives might have perchance been visible—and further, the sleeves of this gaberdine, either on account of their original want, or from a sudden growth of the wearer, merely served, by kindly and with great consideration stopping above the wrist, to set off both the huge bones of that joint, and a hand that exeedingly resembled a warming pan, and which by exposure to the bleak blasts of the stormy weather, was interchangeably of a delicate brown, blue, red, and indeed of every tinge except its natural white, being also of a wondrous horny substance. This delectable personage, in consideration of his special attainments, and marvellous proper personal appearance, was like most men, in his own conceit, a worthy of extraordinary and profound qualifications—and moreover, in high favour with most of the matrons and maidens of the neighbourhood, at whose dwellings he was always a welcome visitor—for joined to his private capacity and calling, that of a travelling preacher and tinker, he was the public leader of psalms—being tune setter at the meetings of the faithful; and from the pursuance of this profession, to a natural snuffing note, he now had obtained a canting, nasal, guttural, quavering method of enunciation in common parlance, so that when he began a sentence, however short, in a low key, it gradually rose to the highest stretch of voice ere conclusion— and when started high, the tones diverged, slowly dropping down; until the last note was almost unintelligible to the hearing: all this was melody to the musical ears of Vrouw Vanderspeigl and other admiring gossips ; and it was often discoursed among them, on what a blessed gift of utterance had been granted unto the precious and chosen youth Wholesome—and that young man, be assured, was not a little vain and gratified by such just eulogiums—for natheless, he was thus affectionately termed a youth, it was only in the word, for Tribulation was no chicken, as was signified by sundry marks of the years of discretion in his person—such as certain deep indentions or wrinkles on the forehead, and divers stray hairs among his close cropped and carrotty locks, that seemed fast changing their original fiery cast, and plainly announced this discreet boy to have sometime cut his teeth, and past the age of infancy—or in other words, to have seen at least a half a century: however, this did not allay his assiduity in any manner— and so frequent and so long was the time spent by him in pious pilgrimages to the warm homesteads of the honest Dutch landsmen—but where by his own accurate relation, his whole solicitude was engaged in the righteous employment of holding forth for the prosperity of the temporal sojourns of his misguided fellow creatures in this world, with the godly given females whom he visited, that from his preference by the sex, either through envy, or for the sake of truly describing his predilections, he commonly was known, and passed currently in the way of derision, among the males, (but this slur he scarce noticed,) by the expressive appellation of sister Wholesome." Ye're well in the body, I take it, dame," out spoke in salutation, or rather, sonorously chanted the man of psalmody, as with two or three prodigious strides his shovel shaped feet cleared the intervening space between the door and fire-place, while his long arms swung out as he stalked forward, like the sails of a windmill in a gale, “on my salvation, it hath been as smart a storm as that wherein Jonah, the elected of the Lord, was cast from overboard a ship wherein he had embarked, fleeing from Tyre unto the land of Gershon, and whereon being swallowed by a hugeous fish, he did remain within the bowels thereof, for three days and three nights before he was released therefrom and cast unto dry land,—as I take it, there will, dame, be a clever snow before daylight doubtless, if so please the Lord.” Having uttered these words without taking cognizance of any other person than the favoured matron whom he addressed, he placed his form, or as he himself in his own clear manner would have explained, squatted the body down in the nearest vacant seat, which he dragged close into the fire without regard to the situation or disturbance of the company—and crossing his legs, he rested his elbows on his knees, and spread out his broad hands before the blaze that sparkled warmly from the hearth. “Dear me, thy coming has been mightily longed for, brother Wholesome, how hast thou tarried thus?” anxiously inquired Vrouw Yokupminshie. “I felt weakened in spirit,” quoth he in return, “and stopped even in my path, to put up in secret a prayer, and vow, as did Jeptha, the holy Judge of Israel, that I might in communing, renovate my inward man—so I wended unto the tents of sisters Charity and Patience Praise-the-Lord, who, I take it, are monstrous clever women—for under their hands I became restored, yea I was made whole through the means of the word and a mouthful of peach brandy, which on my salvation, did much to warm my stomach, and give peace unto the yearning of my bowels.” “Mercies on me! but thou hast come in good time— yet I grieve me for thy mishap, Tribulation Wholesome,” rejoined the matron, “however, here are two men that seeketh for beasts of labour, that they may pursue their journey—also, they lack a guide, for their going is of moment as they state—cannot you, brother, assist them on their way, which lieth, albeit, in despite of the night and the storm, as they represent, unto the city?” “Ye're not in a mistake, on my salvation, sister Yokupminshie Vanderspeigl,” drawled out Tribulation, having first rolled his eyes askance in his goggles on the travellers, and feeling wondrous satisfied with the survey, “You know, I take it, that little resteth in my power, but please the Lord, what I can do, that will I— although my nag wants a sure foot, and the creatur, I take it, is ailing with an attaint that may approach unto a spavin, and so labouring, it would be an abomination to work him: yet, as I take it, there is balm in Gilead, therefore I will venture his strength for a moderate surety.” “I trow, friend, if we can use your horse, and take your services, you shall not feel dissatisfied at the repayment,” said the younger stranger. “Eh!—why—I take it we shan't quarrel,” answered the righteous Wholesome, now for the first time, pretending to notice that others were present besides himself and the dame, by giving a certain bob or jerk of the head, which he meant for an obeisance, “on my salvation I do not think, howsoever, that the creatur is worse than Baalam's ass, after all, though he does balk at times— but you are clever men, I take it—and as Abraham said when he purchased of Ephron the Hittite, the cave of Machpelah, that was the burial place of his family, what matters a few shekels betwixt me and thee? I have hitched him just by the door, and if you will scan him, I doubt not you will find him a beast suitable for thy purposes; for on my salvation, it was but last week I rode him unto praver meeting, with sister Remarkable Hobbs, and brothers Ezra and Gulian Perschieghts, all mounted on his back, and he went as gentle as a lamb led unto sacrifice, yet he was guided alone by a manger halter.” After thus delivering himself, with the same unceremonious manner that marked his first action and movement's, but with a more gracious expression of visage, he arose, and having first with a social bend of his neck, lifted the black jack, which stood on the slaubonk as yet unremoved, to his mouth, he took a long and deep draught from its contents, and then beckoning the company to follow, he led the way, assisted by Yonne, who had hastily provided himself with a lanthorn, towards the schouw huis, at the entrance of which, his steed was fastened. “A finer whole never was conceived—by my halidome! though I wish the fellow would sit a little longer, that I might throw his spirit in the piece,—by the pencil of Angelo! a nobler study never was; a Vandenvelde might envy me—don't walk so fast—let me catch that light—just move your chin, the shadows fall too thick on the throat,” broke from the lips of the elder stranger, as with a pencil in one hand, and his tablets in the other, he pursued the party to the door. The storm still continued, though now much of its violence was spent; for it was but at intervals that the snow rose at its breath, like a wavering and curling celumn—and swept bare and naked in its course, the hard and frozen earth, while deep mounds of drifted fleece, were heaped up against the trees, hillocks, rocks and hedges: it was one of those fearful lapses of the tempest, that bespeaks that its fury is gathering afresh, and that its coming will be like the last and forceful charge of a desperate army, the most blasting and destructive; and yet at times, there came from the clear sparkling drops, a warmth that was grateful to the blood; the drifting particles were as tears of the heavens, renovating amidst desolation. Through wet puddles of dissolved ice, which impeded the way along the hollow and uneven ground that lay between the ferry house and the waters of the creek, stalked undaunted the ungainly figure of the guiding Tribulation, tramping and plashing the water and melting sleet at each step in every direction: close after him, moved the travellers, and the slow and heavy footed Nederlander dragged behind all—while leaning, or rather stretching over the half opened doorway of the dwelling, was the long bust and carefully wrapt up head of mevrouw, as she with one hand held out a flaring lamp, which she endeavoured to shield from extinguishment, 15* with a defence of the open palm and fingers of the other—but in spite of her precaution, it seemed as if the angry elements momently threatened the existence of the light—and sparks of fire driven from the wick flew wildly around, rendering with their faint, uncertain, and sudden dying brilliance, the darkness and dreariness of the night more apparent. Indeed the good dame was shewing a singular and uncommon anxiety in this exposure to the weather—for she was urging her helpmate to return, but without success, to get his night-cap—for she said in bitter, shrill, and tender accents, “he will, the obstinate mule, surely catch a cold—and then let's see who will nurse him—as to her, the lord knew—she had her hands full enough already—without having more trouble with him.” While the matron was thus exhausting herself to no purpose, the anxious Wholesome turned out his charger, which underwent a curious and minute inspection, and truly it was worthy of the time spent therein, for it was a bald-faced, wall-eyed, bare-boned, half-starved animal, with a back that looked as sharp as a razor—a thin, lean body that shewed its whole skeleton—each rib as plain as a whip cord—with shoulders galled and raw at every point, while a coarse untrimmed mane, stuck full with burs, thorns and furze, dried and tangled in the neglected locks which had been probably untended to ever since the beast was in summer pasture, covered the neck— and this last, without pride and unassuming, hung drooping half down to his hoofs, which were grown with huge uncut fet locks and added to his other perfections, the lower joints of the creature's legs were bound with pasterns and bandages, to guard the sharp iron shoes of which there were but two to the four hoofs, from striking and interfering—to complete his appearance, this thin-gutted, and broken-down shadow was without saddle or bridle, being nowise vicious, for when mounted he was easily guided at the option of his rider by a half twisted rope, the flax of which parted as it passed through the hand, and this halter was merely fastened about the neck of the gallant steed, without troubling the animal's mouth or head. “You will not hap on a cleverer beast I take it,” remarked the precious Mass Wholesome, as confidently he unbound the animal from the beam round which the halter had been tied, and cautiously led the reluctant quadruped a few paces—“on my salvation I might have swopped and traded him three weeks past with Garry Von Enghen, or Mony Van Slyck that keeps the public at Bloomaendael, and is an exceeding good judge of horse-flesh, (seeing moreover he belongs to our meeting) for a copper bowl and three pounds of tobacco, booting his old Flanders mare, which had no fault except being a little close sighted—but I give me not unto the carnal and abominable transactions of the men of mammon, for the Lord be praised, I am blessed with a charitable and religious disposition, I seek to divide my mite with those who have need thereof—therefore I object not unto lending thee this beast of carriage, merely asking at thy paying sufficient whereby I may satisfy my conscience—as thou art in haste I take it, and by thy hurry it behoveth me to lose not if the Lord please—four marks in my reflection will not be beyond the value of the service.” “Oh, for the taste and brush of Wouvermans”—said the elder—“that master could never have had a better subject—his very white horse—perfect, perfect—what a lucky dog am I—that chance should give me such opportunities—who knows but the name of Jost Stoll and Paul Potter, or some other great artists of animal life, will go hand in hand surprising the lover of the ancients with the skill of the moderns.” “The sum is not out the way I take it,” pursued Tribulation, after a scrutinizing pause to give the travellers an opportunity of accepting his offer, for which however, they appeared by no means eager. “The creature looketh not in his accustomed trim; howbeit he hath come some distance, and show is but vanity, yet on my salvation his condition exceeds most”— Here the steed, which seemed not at all satisfied at this unusual disturbance of his rest and comfort, for he had counted no doubt on the long inaction, with which he was wonted to be solaced whenever his possessor paid his holy visits to his sisters in the spirit—slipped and stumbled woefully along the icy ground—being either off guard and unprepared to display his points, or owing probably to a certain uselessness of the vision, one of his optics of intelligence being in a total eclipse, and the other scarce superior in guidance. This miscarriage of the charger was followed by a loud and undissembled roar of glee from the expressive lips of Yonne, that made all ring again, while the fallen countenance of the devout Wholesome elongated to a doleful and dire length at the flat contradiction given to his immaculate affirmance by his faultless courser, and being truly confused he failed in his endeavours to explain, that the only cause of the quadruped, or rather triped's misfortune arose from his tail getting between his hind legs, where being of unmanageable dimensions it impeded the use of all those after limbs. In spite of this position which he strongly enforced by reasons incontrovertible—the strangers seemed unwilling to risk themselves on the animal's back, and to the discontent of the precious brother it was arranged that they should proceed on foot under the guidance of Sporus, whose assent after considerable persuasion together with the powerful argument of several pieces of silver, was obtained to the agreement. However, the goodly Tribulation was not to be so thrown out, as his mind for some idea best known to himself was fixed on accompanying the party—and it is just to suppose, his eye was engaged in measuring out a share of the purse, which was so carelessly lavished by the strangers, or otherwise he could not have been induced to forego the recreation and pious amusement of holding forth the word with the righteous damsel Yokupminshie Vanderspeigl. So, under pretence of his interference being of some weight in procuring horses from the farm houses on the route, he volunteered himself and nag—shunning, with singular disinterestedness, the very profitable discussion carefully preserved by the vrouw for him in the enticing and inviting shape of cold venison, pasty, and the divers remnants of the good fare set before the travellers. The matron however, unconscionable woman, looked on the departure of the pslam-setter in a very different light from that which he desired, and as a dereliction from his whilome duty stuck deeply in her breast; and, if the reports of the period state rightly, it was no small space of time ere the incautious Mass Wholesome regained her favour. His mare being adjusted for the journey by the dexterous hands of Yonne, under the peculiar care of his wife—who seemed from the conduct of the brother to have suddenly awakened to bestow peculiar attention on Mienheer—Vanderspeigl was straightway accoutred in a huge and warm overcoat which was fastened by a leathern belt about his waist, and this also accommodated the neck of a stone bottle well filled with brandtwyn; a thick red flannel night-cap shielded his ears from the cold, being snugly covered by his hat, the broad brim of which was brought down by a large cotton muffler tied in a vast and voluminous knot under his chin, while his hands were confined in a pair of thick knitted mittens, with but a thumb and forefinger separate, which grasped a short copper mounted whip, with a head figured of brass—the broad heels also of his jack boots, were ornamented with monstrous iron spurs, weighing at least a pound: thus gallantly and safely equipped, he marched forth as warm a little Dutchman as ever rode on a stormy night. Nevertheless though attired, his difficulties were not ended—for he encountered considerable trouble in mounting his mare—yet after numerous failures and slippings off on one side as he was uplifted on the other, he was at last securely seated in the high peaked saddle, with his feet dangling in and out of the wide wooden stirrups, somewhat to a danger of his keeping an equilibrium. Indeed the ferrymaster was not a great horseman, although the animal that bore him was equally as gentle as the one on which the Records of Nieuw Nederlandts inform us, that Pieter Van Doever, the honest hangman of Nieuw Amsterdam rode (when before a public execution, he exhibited the halter to the good burghers) and which he borrowed from Kouse Van Ranst, who let him have it for a skipple of wheat, being the most foundered beast he had—and astride of which, Pieter looked like a mounted meal bag, for he always wore a cocked hat and a white wig. In the guise above set out, the Nederlander led the way, closely followed by the two travellers, one of whom was obliged, until the party had got without hearing, to turn back to the calls of the Vrouw every minute to receive some new charge and command, which Vanderspeigl was to fulfil on his way— for she enjoined him to recollect that he should inquire the prices of certain articles of wear at the city, and that he should not neglect certain calls, and that he should take care of himself, and not get in difficulty, and lastly, that he should not forget to buy a long list of things, which she separately and minutely tried to impress on his memory—while she scarce noticed Tribulation who brought up the rear of the cavalcade, perched on the back of his meagre spectre-looking nag, with his long lank legs stretched stiffly and stoutly out at least a yard from the sides of the horse like the fins of a fish, while his red lean neck, peering forward to the utmost, brought the curved point of his nose at every jolt and concussion nearly in contact with the half raised ear of the short winded and hard trotting creature that carried him. Indeed a natural risibility at the singular appearance of their attendants moved the travellers until they had progressed on their journey a considerable distance—the further events of which, are more largely detailed in the succeeding section. SECTION III. The night upon the earth is bent, And the cold wind bloweth loud, The close ground's sparkling with the snow Whiter than a dead man's shroud; Like a thousand scattered diamonds glow, And with a thousand shadowings blent— In one white flood the storm doth rave, O'erwhelming nature in a snowy grave. THE JOURNEY AND THE TEMPEST. Taking a route entirely in an opposite direction from the river, the party proceeded for some time over a clear and level country, here and there scantily strown with the poplar and wild locust, and thickets of leafless underwood, fast dying to rottenness beneath the eager tread of winter, and outspread far and near, with one vast and wide sheet of snow, that within its huge embrace hid every vestige of green and verdure that the unpitying frost had spared. A wild, desolate, and dreary aspect pervaded all, and as the last glimpse of the habitation of man died away with the ferry-house they were leaving, it looked as though the travellers had entered on a boundless and trackless wilderness, which had heretofore been untrodden by a step of human life. Their eyes so late cheered by the blazing hearth of Vanderspeigl's home, and unaccustomed to the ghastly whiteness that shone from the earth o'er which they trod, and the thick blackness of the atmosphere, that like a funeral mantle crowded on them, at first almost refused to distinguish the nearer objects; but as their sight grew used to these, in spite of the gloomy visage of the cloudy and lowering heavens, the savage, barren prospect, unchequered with a sign of pleasure, was laid before the view, plain and palpable in cold and icy magnificence. At times, as they hastened on some dusky stump, crowned with sleet, disrobed of all its livery, stunted and bowing low and mournful before the wind like an aged man grey-haired with anguish, the very emblem of decay and death, started suddenly within the way; and again, right in the path would spring, towering loftily in solitary splendour, a blasted larch, barkless, seared, withered, and branchless, rising from the ground like some infernal god or phantom of lost mortality, with the snow about it as it were wrapt in a burial garb; and then the breath of the storm as it flitted above the banks of drift would drive fiercely and roughly against them, filling the air with wild and floating particles of haze, of wet and yellow leaves and the shattered splinters of the forest, seeking an entrance into every opening and fold of their cloaks. And now they would startle upon the courses of the roaming moose, and the tracks of the savage and unwieldy bear were left fresh and vivid as but a moment before he had passed upon the crisp and sinking snow, driven forth from his den by the pinching calls of hunger; deep in the distant solitude, faint as echo, came to their ears the sharp barkings of the wild fox, and the deceptive screams of the wakeful lynx aping an infant perishing in the night; and at times, so close to the path wandered this tameless and ferocious tyrant of the woods, that the fallen dampness could not destroy or dissipate the sweet perfume of his hide, and fearfully for an encounter would the travellers grasp their pistolets against the threatening danger. Once through the dense mist that bound the horizon, there came, losing strength as it approached, the afar off report of a musquetoon followed by the whoop of some belated hunter seeking his watch fire and his comrades, and an interval scarce ended ere there bounded in front of their road, affrighted, with his brown neck arched like an Indian bow and breathing heavily with speed, a gallant and antlered stag, hieing to the wooded and the mountain glade for safety, and as his wandering and distracted eye caught with a sudden and terrified glance the approaching company, he with redoubled haste strained the thick muscles of his broad and ample chest in flight—yet this passage, the herald of man's presence, (for the persecution of the beautiful and innocent ever follows in the wake of his steps,) was broken and buried by the wind, as scarce to be known from the mournful and melancholy murmur of the half frozen rivulet, as it tinkled over its hollow bed, winding in its course like a gliding serpent, and wimpling about the rocks and the blue cakes of ice, the very offspring of its own bosom, that impeded its once rapid and arrowy flowings. After a brief journeying along this waste, the road of a sudden took a different course, and stretching narrowly on the marshy margin of a considerable piece of water, the sluggish and nearly sleeping waves of which, gelid with cold, and half formed in ice, scarce murmured as they heavily rolled in vast sheets to the shore, became broken, trackless and uneven, intersected with frequent sloughs and deep and abrupt hollows filled often with soft snow, deceiving at a glance the most experienced sight with a surface of firmness and strength, but which when risked, instantaneously sank down beneath the trusting weight, while the water rushed upwards through the gaps gurgling as with anger, and flooded all above to a considerable distance, swithering and almost endangering the safety of the tempter—dried, decayed and withered weeds such as line the borders of fresh streams, lay stricken beneath the feet as though cut down by the destroying hand of the mower, yet stiff with clinging icicles that cracked and crumbled in pieces when trod on—stagnant pools, swoln and half mud, bound in a thin and fragile covering of fresh made ice, as weak as isinglass, and often fenced with sharp rushes that bristled around them like pointed stakes, were momently to be leaped by those on foot, while the riders and their horses floundered clumsily through the fords, casting on every side the black dirt that lined the very depths, and often from the dangerous sliding and stumbling of the hoofs on the slimy edges of these pit-holes clearing them at the very risk of the horsemen's lives—the travellers had not proceeded long ere they felt the fatigue arising from the pursuance of a route against such difficulties and roughness of ground. Vol. I. 16 From the period of setting forth, until this part of their travel, but very little conversation, to what, from the characters, might have been expected, had passed between them, and it was not until they had finished the toilsome task of wading through the miry, quaggy and unsound road, and had by dint of great exertion, gained the hard and stony ground that extended beyond it, that the path, which had began slightly to ascend, yet in an extreme rugged and difficult manner and shelving above the bed of the creek, admitted any regular or formal attempts at social speech, besides exclamations, and now and then a cry for assistance, or an assurance of encouragement in their mutual perils, as they dragged themselves through the impeding bogs, drawing their bodies wearily and heavily along. Slow and with tiresome efforts they mounted the way which now gradually wound towards a gloomy line of hill and forest that skirted far across the country—yet on one side, while rocks, woods, and crags, like white spectres rose wildly above them, on the other, a quick descent showed a deep, black abyss, far down, in which scarce distinguishable, the waters by whose brink they late had passed lay sullenly chafing the mountain's root, looking like a lake of ink—and close behind crept one dense and unpiercable mass of mist and darkness. “By my halidome, this view repays one for an age of toil and hardship,” here broke out the elder traveller, as with delighted eye he gazed upon the wild and stormy scene around him, “yea! yon is the very heaven that Romain de Hooghe copied in his deluge at Coerverdon,—by the pallet of Tempesta, this shall not be lost—in spite of the night, from this rock, I may catch a portion of the landscape, and who can tell, that when I, now Jost Stoll, ensign of the province, next kiss the hand of his majesty William the third, he may speak to me as he would to a La Fage, a Redenger, or a Van Kuelen—but I must hasten lest those black troops of clouds flit on— “Was there ever such childish madness—such unguarded folly,” said the companion in a bitter tone, and seemingly highly angered and provoked—“a boy might better have been trusted with that on which depend men's lives than thee—did I not warn thee before, Sir, to silence, yet now you have added to the fault which was so lately reproved—by my troth, if these men be in want of hearing, the wilderness may have ears you wot not of —nay Sir, you need not lay your hand upon your sword —I say again this is neither time nor place to indulge your idle humour. “Pardon, friend Hal,” returned the other, “you know I am touchy, and however just, your reproof was galling —I was in error—but what man of taste—who that like me has seen the paintings at Hampton-Court—the works of Andrea Mantegna—of Guido—of Caracci— “Enough, ensign,” interposed the younger; “look to the desert we are traversing, for an you set out to sketch every glade we pass, I shall not marvel but morning will see us either frozen into statues or buried beneath the tornado which is again gathering over us.” The road was now followed awhile in silence, but which was shortly broken by another of the party;—and this was Mass Tribulation, whose spirit had a long time been contending within him for utterance; for however the dangers of the way during their partial existence employed his curious and active mind, yet the bone breaking jolts of his limping steed, which at every step either flung him prostrate and almost breathless along the hind quarters of the animal, or as by way of reversion forced him to forego the mastery of the halter, and cling with quickness for the preservance of his carcass, by both arms to the neck of the jaded beast—were not sufficient to drive from him a certain inquiring and searching vein which began stoutly to move him, and which soon betokened itself by sundry stray and singular queries, which he sought at convenient opportunities to put at the strangers, particularly to the younger, in whom appeared somewhat of authority beyond the senior; and although the answers he received had little of satisfaction or encouragement in them, he still perservered in his curiosity. Indeed, no rebuff had on him the least effect; for the godly youth's assurance was naturally imperturbable—and like that spirit which has been universally adopted by our modern journalists, extremely capable of every change, and comfortable to the security of its possessor—in short, he was endued with those excellent feelings that will take no offence, or will not understand the most pointed insult if not convenient to receive it; and like the ignoble spaniel, the more he was abused if he thought it would gain him any thing, the more patiently he would bear, and fawn on the hand which struck him. Indeed, he was a creature of that hardened cast of visage which once set, it was a matter of difficulty to discompose, and therefore although heretofore completely driven from the point he wished to gain, he remodelled his attempt; and a cold and unsatisfactory return to some preliminary remark, was unable to overawe him, or prevent his again aiming at the same object. “Ye're not much used to sich going, I take it,” droned forth the pious psalmsetter, varying his key at every word, as was his custom, and abruptly dragging his gaunt limbs across the steed which he bestrode, so that with a very slight inclination of body, which was given by the motion of the horse, his sugar-loaf shaped hat came in contact with the visage of the person he addressed, to the imminent danger of his sight; “yea, on my salvation they bear similitude unto the unwholesome doings and ways of man, which are strewed even like to this on which we journey, with numerous darksome and dolorous pits, from whose depths cometh mighty wailings, and repentance, and direful moaning and tribulation, even as is set down in the tenth hymn, which goeth in long metre. I take it as ye're late from beyond sea, that ye can guess whether the man William, whom they call king, is like to succeed over him they name James. And truly I wonder, natheless I inwardly opine whether thou art not laden with words for the ear of Jacob Leisler, even he who is the temporal ruler of the colony since the fleeing of the boaster Nicholson.” At every breathing space in this harangue, which he whined and drawled forth word by word to an exceeding length, through his capacious nostrils, (these last adding their melody to perfect the cadence of his delivery;) he made at least a minute's pause, possibly with the hope that he might obtain some information in repayment for his dolorous exercise of lungs; but he to whom he spoke seemed placable and content to endure the whole flood of the sermon, a taciturn hearer: but this was not what Tribulation wanted, as, although few men delighted more in the patience of his listeners, yet he was at this period rather desirous of being spoken to than of keeping up the whole burden of the conversation. He therefore, chagrined at his disappointment, yet as in a pleasant mood, guided his charger's head to the side of the elder stranger, whose good natured looks had early proclaimed that silence was painful to him; and in the same snuffling notes the worthy brother proceeded. “I take it ye've found the way tedious —on my salvation, three times have I liked to fall from the back of the dumb brute that beareth me, the Lord preserve me from a fourth chance—I suppose likely ye're seeking to trade at Yorke with notions, or sich like— things are dull, sister Hepzibah Gotobed says, that she could not sell a bushel of cabbages there to any profit—I take it the niggers from the Jarseys cut up that business.” “Why who in the devil's name do you take us for?” warmly returned the man questioned, somewhat nettled at being so widely mistaken in dignity—do I look like a cabbage trader—you snuffling dog—I that have studied the masterpieces of Lely, and Houbraken, of Zatch-leeven and Heek—who have lounged with the wits at Will's Coffee house—have frequented the Park and White's—who have in my day been a true Cavalier—who have kissed the hand of his sacred majesty at Whitehall in full levee —by my halidome this is scandalum magnatum against science, painting, and taste, you canting rascal—did not his majesty say to me—Mienheer Jost Stoll von Nord America wy leeren—” “I am again forced to remind you, Ensign Jost Stoll, since so you will be termed,” interrupted his comrade, “that the fewer words you use the more praise-worthy will be your forbearance—I beg you not to be again wanting in care— 16* “Why, Governor, cannot one open his lips unless—” “Whence this loquacity,” cried the other angrily— “these disclosures are as uncalled for, as imprudent at this juncture—can you not rein in your tongue, but must it be ever thus unruly, or has the hand of treason been busied with thee that thus—” “Treason! do you mean that,” retorted Jost Soll hastily, “Colonel, I have an Andrea Ferrara by my side, that hath seen some service, and I know something of your stockadoes and imbrocadoes—so if you want a subject for a picture in the style of Le Brun and Parrocell, I am your man—bilbo's the word with Jost Stoll”—and he placed himself firmly, putting on a fierce look, and blowing up his cheeks until his face resembled a fiery ball, and at the same time he manfully touched the hilt of his rapier—“your situation did not call for such a rebuke,” pursued the enraged ensign, “and as I am a soldier—” “This is useless,—though you may take leave of sense Ensign Stoll, I am not so far lost; at present Sir I am your superior; therefore move on, hereafter if your passion holds, we can discourse of this matter more at leisure, and if any satisfaction then—” “Nay—nay Sir—I am drawing without rule, my lines are all wrong,” said Jost Stoll, his warmth of feeling dying away as a sudden reflection forced him to perceive the incautious conduct into which he betrayed himself, and the full extent of the danger which might arise from the knowledge he had already made known to the guides by his former remarks—“I did not think as I spoke—but I have done ill—here, Hal's my hand, let's not allow a quarrel between old comrades—I shall strive to act better in future—while as to you” continued he, haughtily drawing himself up and turning to the pacific Tribulation “I see it is merely proving the saw, that it is throwing pearl to swine to discourse with thee.” The dignity intended to have been thrown into this sentence, however was entirely lost on the person to whom the reproof was pointed, for he made now no attempt at an answer, nor appeared desirous in any manner to continue the discourse, for it seemed as if a sudden change had taken place in his very disposition, which may hereafter be divined—yet what had first fallen from the ensign had been differently received by him—a slight grin moved his features with the same power as a loosened anvil, and disclosed the putrid population of his jaws; indeed, the thin, long, hollow, and half-starved countenance of the precious Tribulation was for an instant lighted up as with a certain satisfaction of his inward spirit, (as he might have described it) as though from the remarks that had passed he had gathered something of more than ordinary importance to his self interest; and truly so satisfied did he appear with what he had obtained, that he did not anew strive in any way to pursue his seeking, and although for a short period be anxiously, probably in hopes that further words of moment might be dropped, endeavoured to keep up with the rest of the cavalcade, which now at the desire of the younger stranger pursued the way at a brisker pace, which was often remonstrated against by the Dutchman, who complained in a lugubrious accent “dat his paard would loosh mores wind as was in his bodies”—yet finding all remained silent, the wily Wholesome by degrees began to linger behind, in such a manner, however, as to excite no suspicion—except as wearied by the difficulties of the road. By this time, the narrow path had assumed a still more mountainous aspect, presenting at intervals almost insurmountable obstacles to the rapid progress of the travellers; for leading up a broken and precipitous ledge of rock they ascended a passage, or rather gully worn in the sides of the hill, and which continued its course over the very brow of the highland, so that in a very short space the way became so extremely steep and dangerous, and often the brief line of the rock which they occupied was so obstructed by huge projecting pieces of granite and fragments of grey and shattered crags bedded for ages in the ravine, that it was rarely possible to keep the ground abreast, or even to distinguish the route many yards ahead; and here and there nearly blocking the further procedure as well as sight, would stretch forth some scathed tree, whose hundred roots like the claws of the spider had twisted and warped themselves in the fissures of the cliffs, half covered with dark garments of ice, mingled with the undying and fadeless moss, while a shower of wet and snow dropped down, as the passengers passed beneath the bare, solitary and blighted branches, that still clung to it, and guarded it with embowering arms, seeming like the spears of a warrior, over whom the brunt of the conflict had borne, but who yet remained, though seared, dauntless and unconquered—while far down in the hollow glen to the left, in the breaks of the dark masses, and shadows of the forest of wild ash trees, and the tangled copsewood, that clothed with a shroud of night and cold autumnal dreariness the ragged edges of the hills, at times could be perceived some flashing waterfall or distant lagoon, though scarcely to be marked through the dropping mists, except by dark or moving spots in the boundless vales of snow, by which they were encircled: tremors of awe pervaded the bosoms of the travellers, as they gazed on the magnificence of unbridled nature which surrounded them, and the appalling visage of the wilderness seemed to impress them as it were with a superhuman voice. Obliged to surmount such obstructions, contrary to their wishes, reluctantly being on foot, and forced to use their utmost energy, the two strangers soon began to feel greatly fatigued in the accomplishment of their tedious task, and it was not long, ere symptoms of abated vigor were manifested in their flagging and slackened walk, and as they ran o'er many a rapid computation of the distance they had already journeyed, (for when tired and exhausted in the pursuance of travel, it appears a singular relief to con over the miles we have crossed,) they began heartily to desire the assistance, which the ferrymaster at setting out, had stated they were likely to obtain from some of his neighbouring settlers—but it was in vain their sight endeavoured to pierce the surrounding darkness; the way yet seemed lengthening, and in spite of their weariness, and what they had already combated, new inconveniences presented themselves to retard their desired haste; and neither, though anxiously listened for, did the baying howl of the guarding ban-dog proclaim the nearness of an enclosure, nor a light move its twinkling lustre along the deep vistas of the close and fantastic figured thickets of hazel and dwarf oak, that peopled the huge swelling knolls around them, to give a single hope that a habitation was, in case of need, attainable: all seemed a lonely solitude—as desolate and deserted by man, as fitted for the haunt of the destroying wolf, or the roaming wild cat, whose dens are in the recesses of the forest, and who fly the human face. “By my halidome, though this may be a country fit for a Salvator to study from, it begins to conquer me,” exclaimed Jost Stoll, as he impatiently drew closer his large cloak against the severity of the atmosphere, and peevishly endeavoured to drag his body along so as to keep up with his companions, but in the accomplishment of this necessary exertion, his legs were forced to contend against a heavy drawback in his tremendous jackboots, which, whenever they touched the earth, appeared to take an affection for the soil they pressed—so much so, that they did not part from its embrace without carrying away some thick tokens of remembrance: “an I hold out longer, it will be a miracle,” continued he, “I trow, if some auxiliary in the shape of horses comes not soon, I shall never finish another picture, but shall be left as a league mark in this dismal waste—by the brush of Parmegiano, a storm looks well on canvass—but it is rather of sad endurance.” “In sooth, I have seldom traversed a more tedious road—and a worse country I have never seen; I did not expect that the island itself was so wild and poorly inhabited,” said his comrade in reply; “ensign, I am as nearly knocked up as you appear to be; indeed I can hardly keep feet:” and then addressing Vanderspeigl, he pursued, “master, we have crossed a long stretch of ground, much more than from your dame's account, I had supposed lay between your dwelling and its neighbours—and truth, this road appears to have been but little used—have we far yet to go?” The Hollander had, for most of the route, made good his accustomed silent character, and from being snugly mounted, he had met less disadvantage from toil, than his employers, and therefore had full leisure for exercise of mind—though indeed if he was visited by any thought during the long interval of absence from speech, which he imposed on himself, it might have been in what manner he could most cunningly induce the travellers to add to the sum of money which he had already received from them for the use of himself and his string-halted Bucephalus—in driving the one forth in the cold storm, depriving him of his accustomed warm sleep in his comfortable slaubonk, and the other from his pleasant straw couch and manger,— but being now aroused by the words just spoken to him, he answered somewhat testily, no doubt, being teased at his having been so unceremoniously disturbed in the midst of some very important reverie—“Mien goot Got! zo u is dired is nien von mien vault—Ik did nien mak der wegh—blesh mien hertz and zeil, Ik dort dis moud gome zo, as any oder ding dat u dinks—ja! der jonkers mill dravel in der nagt mit his koppig vollie—mien Got, and mien boor merrie muzt zuffer mit his nonshenze.” “Come, my master, this avoids my asking—the night's too black and piercing with frost, to waste words—speak out, are we yet distant from any place where we can procure horses, and a temporary warming for our almost chilled frames?” “Mien Got! vat a hurries der mensch ish in—Ik believes—ja, dat is, Ik dinks dat—nien—nien, Ik is zure doo—op mien zeil, dis is no more as dree myl vrom der Zouth riviere boint—dat ish waar mien kennis Gottlieb Affleback der hoogdiutscher doktor lives—mien Got—he has dree more horshes as dat u wants.” “Three miles, the devil! I can scarce stir ten yards,” groaned Jost Stoll, “why as true as the pencil of Palma, your wife said—that is, gave us to understand—” “Dunner und blexum! der Vrouw kens no more as vone kind,” cried the Dutchman warmly, “Got tam! vy der dunner u buts der womansh in mien deeth? Ik dells u dat tish dree Hollandt myl—mien Got, mores dan voor, Ik believes—Ik weit het zeer wel; hoe der duivel should der vyfers dink—op mien zeil, tish niet der vrouw wark vor do dink—mien Got!”— At this moment, Tribulation, who had been attracted by the discourse that was passing and had drawn himself towards the party interposed—“There dwells in these parts,” said he, “a pious and worthy brother, who is a compounder to the righteous, healing the bitter words to their ears which the unfaithful cast upon them; of a certainty, he is a preacher of the truth, and is one who followeth not the bleating of Jeroboam's calves in Dan and Bethtel, and he hath pitched his tent a short ride hence, even a stone's throw, in this howling wilderness. I take it, for a reasonable recompense, forbye that which the beasts might earn, he will kindly lend unto ye those of which ye're in need, and at the expense of a mark, I will, if it please the Lord upon this animal of mine, go unto the man Job Ne'erdoill, and warn him of thy neighbourhood and wants.” After a desultory consultation on this offer, it was determined as best in the present emergency, that while the rest slowly proceeded onwards, Mass Wholesome should seek out the domicile of the patient Job, and having obtained from that benevolent personage the loan of his horses, for whose use, however, the psalmodist was fully empowered to bargain with him, he then should make all speed in overtaking the party, which, from the tardiness they now journeyed, would easily be effected. In pursuance of this arrangement, Tribulation prepared to turn his palfrey's head and depart down a small opening, which led from the road on which they were proceeding, and which seemed rather formed by the foot of the hunter in pursuit of game, or by some beast of the wild, as a track and path to his den, than as a way to the house of man; for the bushes and brambles that fringed the woods at its mouth being trodden down were the only sign that denoted its existence—the will, however, of the holy brother was sooner said than done—for a greater obstacle presented itself to his wish of going in this narrow path than he had first imagined, and this was through the wilfulness of his gallant steed—this creature who was so honoured in bearing him, and whose various perfections have at large been descanted on, added to his other superior virtues that of balking, and whether he had an inclination for company and wished to remain with his nose in the same direction he had set out, it is hard to discover, at any rate, at the first motion of his rider to change his position, he placed his forefeet stubbornly a few paces before his body, and would not in spite and defiance of sundry kicks, cuffs and knocks which sounded hollowly through his lean ribs, broach a single step; nor was it until he had gallantly endured much abuse, and gone through divers marvellous evolutions that threatened each time an extraordinary display of Tribulation's agility in loosening him from the seat which he so manfully occupied, and after he had been often coaxingly led forward, that the obstinate animal would in anywise concede his will or consent to submit to his master's guidance— and when at last, as if by a sudden freak impelled, he did set forth, it was at full gallop, over stump and stone, and down steeps lined with furze and brushwood, as though flying from the following of an enemy, to whom, as in daring, it sent back his hate by flourishing one hind leg in flight like the bow of a fiddler ere he begins his melody, and merely using in progressing the other three—all however of which heroic feats were performed to the evident discomposure of the steady Wholesome;—yet adverse to this slight difference, they made an excellent appearance together, for from their thin and meagre aspect, both looked as though every gust of wind that swept by, would have blown them away at once. “Is your friend who has just left us,” said the traveller to Vanderspeigl, as Mass Wholesome disappeared through the trees, “always as inqusitive and forward as he has been to night—or is it the custom of the country to make such minute inquiries of the business of every wandering stranger.” “Mien vriend, wie dells u dat—goot Got—hy ish mien kennis—ja—hy is nien mien gezelschap,” returned the Hollander shortly and indignantly, “blesh mien hertz, dough—zister. Wholesome is mien vrouw's gezelinne—dat is vat is mien vifer's vriend.” “Well, then, your wife's friend, since it so pleases you,” pursued the other smiling, “he is one whose conduct appears to me to bear a more than ordinary concern in us—and I demand at you whether it be usual for him so to demean himself to all he meets, or if it be now first assumed towards us?” “Op mien zeil, heer—Ik weet'er niet van—dat is Engelsch spreeken—Ik droubles mienzelf mit oder beoble's dings nien mores as dat is noding—zizter Wholesome breaches mit mien Vrouw, den Ik zmokes mien byp zo as any's oder mensch dat is redelyk, dat is Hollandts is nien vone vool.” Finding no advantage from pressing the Nederlander further on a subject of which he appeared either wilfully blind and ignorant, or that from his native indolence and apathy of disposition, he had not troubled himself to note, the traveller dropped the discourse—and all silently pursued the way o'er the waste and barren ridge of wildly varied and continuous hills, which became, each moment as they progressed, if possible, more hopelessly sterile, dreary and disconsolate in aspect—though in traversing them, their late worn out spirits and frames, seemed to have gained for a short space, new vigor for exertion, being renovated in the hopes of receiving early and speedy succour. But now they had followed the route for a considerable period beyond that in which they had solaced themselves in being overtaken by the messenger Tribulation—and yet not the least sign of the righteous man was discerned—though every shadow, and aught that resembled life or living thing, was anxiously watched for on the expected road. Often, some dark fir tree, lessened by distance, and shaking its foliage in the breeze, would for a time, be likened, by the busy aid of fancy, into the shape and form of an approaching figure—and again, some broken and ragged Vol. I. 17 piece of rock, jutting suddenly and rudely forward at the very turning of the pathway, would cause the party to stop and call long and loudly, to direct what appeared vividly their coming friends—but it was vain—minute after minute flew swiftly on, yet brought not those looked for: and although the travellers had not, in all probability, proceeded a half a mile from the spot on which they had parted with Tribulation, yet full twice the distance might have been passed with ease, in a much shorter circle of departing time: from this delay, suspicion in various guise, took possession of the mind; the strangers were men who had much to fear—and such was their situation, that an instant's detention, might be fraught with consequences of extending and destructive evil—not only to their personal safety, but to the perfection of the object they were eagerly hurrying to attain,—still, as the mind buoyed up by hope, loves to banquet on the luxury which a fair prospect presents, various excuses for the delay of master Wholesome, at first thronged to them, and served for awhile to banish unfavourable impressions—yet soon against these, it became evident that he had either lost their track, or had designedly deserted them. And truly the latter supposition, had every fair foundation for its support—for as it is above stated, the cunning hypocrite had been rather incautiously trusted, through his representations of the charity of brother Job Ne'erdoill, with a small earnest of the gold that he was to place in the kind Job's hands, by way of equivalent to the desired and generous loan of his animals of labour: and as the amount received by Wholesome, was what sufficed his own conscience in the attention he himself had so condescendingly and beneficially bestowed on the travellers it is supposed that his long tarrying was caused by a secret dubitation of spirit and reluctance of soul, in parting with what sat so comfortably in his pocket; yet the honest psalmsetter ought not altogether to be considered capable of such barefaced duplicity, as is here somewhat laid to his charge, for as it was afterwards proved by his own lips, in detailing his experience at what his sect term the weekly feast of love, the business thus befell him—that not having been able to obtain the relief he was sent after, for Job was a crusty fellow at times, and like many other saints was given to some of the carnal ways of man, particularly to taking too much comfort from strong liquors; and being at the period whereon Tribulation called on him rather more disguised than usual on account of the cold, he would not listen to reason, seeing that Wholesome merely spoke of his lending his horses by way of benevolence, carefully keeping back all offer of the money or of any pay whatever; for he very generously told Job that it was a crying sin, practised by those wallowing in the gall of bitterness and the floods of iniquity, to seek for a reward for that which it was the duty of the brethren to extend, like the Samaritan of old, unto their fellow men; no matter whether they were given to the mammon of unrighteousness or followers of the word. But all had no effect on the obdurate Job, who heard him as patiently as his namesake in the Scripture might have done; and then with a hearty oath told him to get out of his house, for he was not in a humour to hear the word. Being so refused he departed, and thinking it adviseable, as the best way to overtake the travellers, he set forth to make a circuit of the hills and meet them on their descent to the commons:—which having partly performed, his inward spirit and its outward attendant, (his body,) wrestled mightily and grievously one against the other— and unfortunately the combat was decided in favour of the unclean and sinful clay, for having been entirely unprepared for so severe a night, he concluded, with a due share of reluctance and a lengthy debate thereupon, that he had better seek the earthly tabernacle of his brother Baregrace Trebletext, who luckily dwelt within a few yards of the memorable spot whereon he had held the profound argument aforesaid; where having alighted, he consulted the divine upon his speculations of the night, that nothing blameable should be attached unto him; stating, that he took it that so small a sum as two marks could not be an object to persons such as he described the bestowers—and that on his salvation they were Philistines, and peradventure worshippers of the scarlet whore —it was therefore, doubtless, a charity to the sinful wretches, “men” as he expressed it, “blinded and misled in spiritual affairs and unconverted in heart; yea,” he went on, “it would be as snatching brands from the burning, if the base lucre should be retained for the furtherance of the good word.” All of which determination was strengthened and confirmed by the gifted opinion of that sanctified and reverend pastor Trebletext, who always qualified his remarks with the saving sentence, “God willing,” being a true savour of his extraordinary piety; as is the case with a certain other sacred character duly ordained but whom it becomes not the unholy to hint at—nevertheless it is worthy of record, as a serious proof of his zealous spirit of ministry, that having agreed to serve one set of his admirers, who gave him a call, as a fat living is termed, he sent them word that, God willing, he would shortly be with them; but lo! even saints' and holy men's assurances are as liable to fail—yea, are as deceptive as carnal laymen—so the expectations of the callers were in vain, and only roused for disappointment; for it came to pass that providence, which feedeth the hungry, gave the disinterested follower of the Lord just mentioned, another call elsewhere, whereunto appertained much more of the goods of this world—yea, and the salary was of a greater sum, though the first was not insignificant. But as the gifts of the Lord are not to be despised, so he deemed it sufficient to inform by writing those who were looking first for him, “that he could not come unto them, for lo! God was not willing.” And after this orthodox fashion it was agreed by Tribulation and his pious pastor, that the sum should be equally divided between them; which was performed in the most equitable manner imaginable—to wit, Baregrace received one mark while Tribulation kept the other, and also an odd piece of money, that he had neglected—or which, rather, in deference to his purity of conscience, had entirely slipt his memory to mention. Meanwhile to the bewildered travellers every appearance of a regular or beaten trackway, which until now had accompanied their labours, and upheld their courage from entirely sinking, in the faint belief of yet meeting some hut or sign of the residence of man, began slowly yet totally to disappear; while the nature of the ground on which they trod assumed so break-neck and treacherous a character—interchangeably of abrupt ascents and sudden and broken hollows—that it became a risk of life and limb for the ferrymaster to continue in the saddle; so that now he was obliged to dismount, and engage with an uncommon activity to sooth or force the terrified and reluctant animal forward, along the slippery borders and brinks of precipices, where it looked as though the slightest falter, or the breath of the night would have consigned all who ventured to the edges to certain oblivion and death. Often did the animal start back from his course, as sensible of the danger that he was urged to brave; and scarcely when blinded would he advance, while his sides heaved with the beating of his heart, and he panted in terror. It was now one of those intervals when the snow had ceased to descend—yet the heavens afforded not a gleam of light, but were wrapped in a gloomy and ashen pall, that looked like the trappings of a burial; still, in one single spot, through a far spread, round, yet hazy and stormy circlet, shone out the dying and fading moon, battling for a glimpse of the earth that it was wont to light, through the huge voluminous groups of mustering clouds, that at times were duskily folded over its face—yet went the travellers onwards with nearly a midnight around them, trampling oftentimes over the ground bare and naked from the wind, so that in many places, the lank grass, battling for life with winter, looked green and felt soft beneath their tread, until the incautious plashing of their feet, as they sank in the swampy fen or the morass, would startle the bittern, the shypoke, the lapwing, or the speckled curlew, who still lingered about their summer couches, the oozy nests of dank and withered sedge, to give with 17* shrill, monotonous and plaintive screams, a mournful and melancholy warning to retrace their steps: and now, the shadowing, though leafless and forked branches of broad plumps of ancient oaks, as they drooped above the heads of the weary journeyers, darkened before and around them, even beyond the night's blackness—while hosts of sharp, dried saplings that sprang about each parent tree, barred all further progress, and would force the party to return back a considerable distance, thriding close and tangled thickets of thornberry, spicewood, and wild percimmon, whose armed heads tore their garments, and lacerated their flesh. Though repeatedly questioned, yet the Dutchman for a long time, steadily affirmed that they were on the right route, and at every doubt of such assertion, and as appearances seemed to dispute his correctness, such were now frequently expressed by his companions, he would reply or mutter a surly and resentful answer.—“Dat he kennen der wegh zo goot as oder mensch dat had a nues on his vace—ja! Got tam,” said he at one time, apparently provoked, as he was pestered and examined on his capacity as a guide, and his knowledge of the road, “dosh der jonker dink Ik vone kind—vone littel schild—op mien zeil! Ik has drabelled dis blace mit mien oogleeden closh as dite zo as vone hang-slot—dat is vone bad-locksh—mien Got bresarve mien zeil,” proceeded he, lifting up both hands in amazement, at the audacity of supposing him ignorant of the way, “wie has zeen der liksh dat dis is zince mien moeder game vrom Vlairdengen—mien goot Got—ja—” His assurances now, however, in spite of all his protestations, were fast beginning to lose effect, and notwithstanding his natural immovable and imperturbable coolness of countenance and action, which had heretofore been greatly aided by sundry strong and sly potations from the stone pottle which depended from his belt, and whose secret assistance as yet had rendered him almost senseless to the attacks of the frost—he nevertheless was evidently become disconcerted by the aspect of the country, yet upheld by a constitutional obstinacy which strengthens men in error, out of mere daring, and shame of being convinced of acting wrong, he still persisted in leading onward, without, as it soon was apparent, the least certainty, or even idea, of the probable correctness of the bearing of the direction he was pursuing,—nor did he yield in his pertinacity, until assailed by fears for his own personal safety—and truly this was to him a most important point—one that he was greatly careful on, and exceedingly easy to be moved; for like many others, he was the more anxious about his life and limb, as they were most worthless; and truly it is from such preserving and cautious feelings, that so many knaves deface the fair visage of the earth so much longer than retribution for their crimes and villanies ought rightly to allow. To these movements, in the breast of Sporus, was now adjoined a secret idea, which was sternly embodied on his mind, and which for some time had been growing even from a small and latent thought, unto a violent and frame pervading action,—the Dutchman had, between sleeping and wakening, as he was wont to sit beside his fire at home, unconsciously imbibed from Yonne's relations, a certain strong belief in the existence and earth visitations of supernatural beings; and often with eager ear, he had drank in the soul disturbing descriptions of the black. The sad evidences of Indian murders, and the damnable effects of the powow service to the devil by these heathens in their dwellings of Satan, were at this period, a like terror to the whole colony—so that by law, the performances of such mysteries were punishable with death: and terrific visions were presented, by the force and circumstance of his situation, to the sensible and susceptible nerves of the Nieuw Nederlander, however dull of apprehension on matters not so immediately personal, and his spirit was wonderfully wrought on, considering that every story he had heard, was strongly attested; some of the narrators having gone so far as to say, that if necessary, they would not mind swearing to what they had beheld on the brass clasps of Dominie Van Gieson's great parchment covered Bible,—a folio, whose size and sacredness, was believed to be hallowed: and further, as to the very manner and distinct dress of the relations, the vividness of the Hollander's recollection, seemed to perfect itself nearly in a moment, as he looked about him midst the darkness of the forest; the groan of the tall pine tree, disturbed by the blast, as it rushed with the wing of an eagle o'er its towering crest, the sudden and startling yell of the ounce, as it roamed abroad in the jungles of the mountain, were conjured up, and dressed out in the livery of dire and nameless phantasies of the `woud gest' and the koubold;—and ever and anon, under the influence of such disturbing imaginings, with sudden jerks of the body, Sporus would cast twitching and startled glances about him as he stalked along, and with a quick and nervous step, would almost spring close to the side of his companions in trouble—who, extremely angered at his bearing, after having wandered a long while by this uncertain and random guidance, at last obtained, by threats and persuasion, a sullen and dogged confession of his dilemma, from the obstinate, and equally timid and stupid Mienheer. “By Saint Paul, this fellow resembles the composition of Peter Testa, the engraver—he is all in confusion,” said Jost Stoll, as the surly ferrymaster crabbedly informed them of the perilous situation in which his ignorance had betrayed them—“trow! we have a dark back ground—all shadow—not a glimpse of light—foregad, Domenichino never painted more dreadful figures than we shall cut, an we are forced to linger here till daylight.” “It is strange you should be thus lost, after such strong affirmances—and the road is one, that ought to be known by all who live on the island,” said the younger traveller, sternly gazing on the Hollander. “Mien Got,” answered Vanderspeigl dryly, while every feature remained unbent, or from the darkness, the stranger was unable to perceive a change, though he stood at his side—“mien Got,” said he, “Ik dreads der wegh, Ik dells u, in der dagligt, zo well as oder beobles—der duivel—tish nien zich wonder dat Ik 'sdakes mienzelf, as tish zo donker as bitch—Got tam!” “Curse on that stupid brain of thine—what are we to do? I'm tired—fainting—freezing,—which course can we take?” cried the ensign rapidly—impatient, as he felt his limbs grow weaker, from the fatigue so uselessly endured: “it was madness—tempting the wrath of heaven itself, to venture forth in such a night—what difference could it have made, and—must we perish in this desert?” “Nay, comrade—you know not what you say—let us keep up a good heart—things may not yet be so desperate,” returned his companion calmly, “suppose Mienheer tries the strength of his Dutch lungs; he has drawn us in this danger, let him strive to rescue us.” “Mien goot mensch,” exclaimed Sporus, somewhat alarmed, “u mill niet hab Ik raish der woud duivel vrom his zleeb mit der sneuw—mien Got bresarve—” “Ay, you rascal,” shouted Jost Stoll, “any devil, to help us free of this dismal solitude—so call away, or by my halidome, I shall be forced to beat you, to keep the blood warm in my viens.” The Nederlander needed no stronger hint, as the stout arm of solid animation, which was exhibited by the soldier, for the time presented an argument more powerful in Vanderspeigl's sight, than the whole world of spirits; and long and stoutly did he call: but neither his loud sounding halloos, nor those of his fellows in affliction, appeared to receive any answering hail or voice; the faint echoes of each, as they floated away in the distance, were alone heard in the pauses of the storm; or were returned by the hoarse scream of some frightened cormorant, as it rose in alarm from its mountain nest; and often, such was the din of the blast, that their strongest efforts were dwindled to the weak cries of infants, and carried away as though unheard, and merely swelling the whistling of the wind: and now, as if to fill the dreadful measure of their wretchedness, the tempest increased in violence, raging with devastating fury; at first, a thick shower of dense and sleety rain, came pouring down, rendering all things around undistinguishable; so that it was in vain, that the eye strained to catch the outline of some neighbouring object in the black and dreary expanse, and though at times they fancied shapes and forms amid the fog, the next moment, a gust of wind would whirl away the fantastic illusion, and reduce them to actionless despair; then would come the power of the blast, rolling at first upon the ear like distant thunder, and seeming to mutter appalling threats—and then opening in its anger with a noise so deafening, that they could not speak to each other, for their words were lost and drowned as in the rushing of wings. The drift around them was in continual agitation, rolling along in mighty volumes of strange and changing forms, and so heavy as to affect respiration: it was useless to struggle against its careering strength, for every instant the wind received fresh force, until the trees were almost uplifted by the roots, and intermingled with horrible crashings, groaning and creaking incessantly, and shattering their boughs in a thousand pieces, as they struck against each other: fibres of wood and torn splinters, were caught and swept along, and clouds of snow, and of withered leaves, showered around in every direction:— all was frightful and distracting; one rapid and fearful tumult, that rendered the mind confused and dizzy with perturbation. To proceed onwards at random, was impracticable, or only plunging deeper in the disconsolate difficulties of the waste, in which they were already so sadly entangled: nor were the travellers able, though they turned back, to retrace their steps; they examined the rocks and turnings, the trees and glens, but not one could they recollect; the full and vivid horror of their abandonment, alone broke upon them; and it appeared to differ but little whether they fled away, or remained to meet the event on the same spot; and indeed they could not move one single step without risk, or drawing destruction down on them; while, to complete their misfortune, their limbs became debilitated to the weakness of striplings, and the piercing and frosty breeze, cut their flesh to the very bone, with the sharpness of a tempered scymetar of a hostile foe; each joint fast stiffened, and seemed as if rendered moveless and stark, as touched by the wand of the magician, death: o'erborne with fatigue and cold, the horse of the Dutchman sank down on the snow, and gasping, stretched out its useless limbs; his master, cast himself in grief, upon the body. The travellers gazed on each other—they were separated far from the homes of men—beyond the voice of assistance—as it were, cut off from the peopled world—despair, in its most terrific garb, rose to their sight—they would perish—none could tell where their corses would be found—the wild would be their tomb—a hundred thoughts of the past, in strange and feverish array, came thronging and mingling in the scene in which they acted—they were as men cast out from their fellows, and marked for sacrifice: those dreadful feelings which press like lead upon the bosom, and seem to bid us give o'er exertion, since it avails not, hung heavy on their hearts: they wildly with their hands, covered their eyes, that they might avoid the mental distraction, occasioned by the sight of external objects,—gradually, however, their alarms and anxieties became less intense; a sort of stupor, like a cloud, gathered o'er their senses, and such was the effect of the deadly wind, which they had so long combatted, and which now was pressing on to conquest, that a darkness crowded on their brain—a drowsiness weighed on their brows, that, combined with the fatigue and excitement they had been under, seemed to oppose all exertion: the ensign faintly drew his cloak across his breast, and dropped down on a bank of snow, conscious only of existence, by a feeling of vague and insupportable hopelessness: the younger traveller sat down beside him, first, as though stupified, and then he took him by the hand, but the coldness shot in anguish to his heart; he nearly fell beside his dying comrade; the howl of a wolf aroused him—it was but few paces off, and rang in his ear like a blow from a giant—he sprang on his feet—he shook the nearly lifeless Jost Stoll—he called on him, and the Dutchman, by name— but they moved not, and he resumed his position beside them; the energy of his frame relaxed with listlessness and desperation, like a man who had long been battling for life in some frail bark, and who at last, is driven to shipwreck on some unknown, barren and uninhabited coast, rescued from one death, to meet another more severe; still hope, a desire of life contended within him; there appeared a baseness and unmanly crouching to fate, to give up all without another effort; he strived to awake his failing faculties, which were fast flying him one after another, and seeking out the splinters of wood that lay about him, he tried to kindle a fire—but in vain—the wet had sunk to their hearts, and rendered unavailing his utmost attempts: frustrated in this, he hung over the shattered branches which he had collected, like the mariner over the skeleton of his stranded boat, when he gives up all as lost: soon his breath grew short and thick, as its warmth commingled in the chilled and icy atmosphere, while the very flood of living fire that sported in his veins, appeared fast losing the genial heat on which depended life; his ears began to ring with stunning and unearthly sounds—distorted and terrific shadows, in transitory and unsatisfactory bands, swam before his dim eyes, and he would extend his arms to catch the passing objects, as if he was grasping at a hold on earth, which was passing away. “It was not thus I hoped to end my days—to die not thus—not thus,” he said in a short interval of conscious and heart rending, bitter agony; “Oh God! doth here all those gay prospects of my youth cease in bleak and hopeless night! Yet what have I deserved? wild wassail, riot, debauchery, hath filled the brief span of my careless life. I have not acted as my sending on earth destined—but wasted in profuseness and extravagance, health and talents.—Out on this infant chiding—what now avails complaint in this last hour? is it fit—is it manly that the stern criminal at the gates of death shall weakly cry on fate—on mercy—and deprecate the endless wo to which the unrestrained hours he led in hardihood hath brought him? And yet were my days spared, it might be, for I am not old, that future times should see that—but what matters it—there is no help—there is no help—and if—but I should die as becomes a man, not cling thus to this foolish, deceiving hope, that makes me sad at parting as a miser from his treasures.” He lay down amid the withered leaves, while the snow drifted violently about him—piling around his prostrate body like the earth of the grave at the sides of some uncovered corse—he grew fainter and fainter—a dead weight like iron was on his brain—the remembrance of even his situation was only renewed by fits and starts, as though perception of created things was nearly lost— but once again his faculties appeared renewed, and he looked fearfully from side to side—he gazed upon the arms of a mighty tree that waved in the wind above him, and by his distorting vision seemed tottering to a fall; he wished that the falling timber might crush and release him from his misery—he revelled in the thought— for it seemed as though connexion with the living was broken, and he retained no human or earthly ties. His senses swam—and his eyes, now weakened to exhaustion, closed as it were from mere pain; and then there came a voice close to his ear, as from the lips of his comrade, yet he scarce heard it, for his limbs grew motionless— stiff-like with the ice of death—a very slumber, tranquil and senseless was on him, when sudden a sound, sharp and loud, startled him, and he awoke; the noise petrified his very frame, but although he strived at first to listen, it was in vain; yet when again it was repeated, such was the joy and surprise that pervaded him that he had almost relapsed into his former helplessness, for it was the report of a gun followed by the deep mouthed baying of a wolf dog, that, even in its roughness, came as sweet to his ears as music to the listening sick. In an instant all weakness was fled, his intellectual powers returned with increased vigour and acuteness, and appeared to vie with each other; while, as he shouted, every nerve trembled with agitation and fear lest the succour should not be real, but a mere deception of the sense— and as soon as the call was echoed by the cheerful voice of man, the blood rushed back in a torrent to the heart, Vol. I. 18 as with the joyful bound of a stag, and he sunk down overcome by fatigue and agitation. “Thank heaven, we are saved, we are saved,” burst joyfully from his lips, as he beheld his comrades revived and starting from their couches of despair and death, as an answer was twice repeated to his call. At a short space of time a large dog sprang through the thicket, and with fierce and malicious barkings darted towards them; but his ferocity was soon soothed to silence by the appearance of a savage looking man who followed. “Down, Luath, down, thou noisy hound,” said the stranger; and the animal, passive and obedient ran fawning about him. A lanthorn which the man bore in one hand, by its strong yet transient gleams discovered to the party his singular, grim and haggard visage, overrun by a grey and grisly beard, which appeared to have been long unshorn. He was, as well as could be distinguished, a tall, gaunt, bony figure; with sinews and muscle that indicated almost gigantic strength;—a buckskin hunting shirt, dressed with the hair outward, hung half way between the hip and knee, and was tied round his waist with a leathern thong; his legs were covered with stockings of blanket, and his feet with socks of deer skin; on his head he wore a cap made of the hide of some wild animal, but dyed of a scarlet colour, after the manner of the Indian—and in one hand he held a long-barrelled Spanish musquetoon; a hatchet and knife, bared to the handle and glittering in the red light, were stuck in the thong which bound his garments. He greeted the benighted and perishing travellers in a voice, the roughness of whose tone was strongly contrasted with the kindness intended, and after a few inquiries of their distress, which was briefly conveyed to him, as much by their appearance as words, he proceeded to state that if their strengths could support it, he would conduct them where, not many paces distant, several of his companions, hunters, who had been bewildered also in the snow storm in the far pursuit of game, had been enabled to build their watch-fire within the shelter of a ruined and deserted hut, and in their name he offered a share of the succour and scanty protection which its walls afforded, as to fellow-sufferers by the tempest. Mustering up cheerfully at this speedy chance of relief their remaining spirit, they blessed him for his proffered hospitality, and with an activity scarcely to be expected from their worn and weakened frames, they hastily prepared to follow the leading of the stranger. “Mien Got! dou gant leive mien merrie behind,” cried Vanderspeigl in a piteous tone, after having endeavoured to arouse the quadruped which had so long served him; “hy mill berish—mien Got!” continued he, perceiving his attempts fruitless, for the poor beast only opened its eyes to his well known voice, and with an expression of indescribable anguish, licked the hand that was extended to lift his head, and then with a deep moan closed his sight again”—mien got—what mill the vrouw Yokupminshie zay to dis—mien got—mien merrie—hy gost me zo mush as durteen schilling den jaar bast—mien got— ik sall be vervoesting, dat is a proken mensch—mien got —and dere doo is mien hundred bieces—got tam! Ik sall loosh mores dat mien zeil ish gost, mien merrie, mien byp, mien hondred—got tam!”—and he wrung his hands in despair and dolor. The promise from the travellers of a future equivalent for his loss—scarce comforted him —and it was to the repeated commands and urgings of his companions that at last he tore himself away from the now stark corpse of his once faithful and patient servant. Den guilder mill nien puy hish weergade op mien ziel”—groaned the afflicted Hollander as with a slow step he lingered to gaze back to the spot where lay the body —“ja—hy gost mores as dat dirteen schilling—ik pought der peast vrom Mienheer Van Ranst dat geebs gattle vor zale by der varm von oud Jacobus Beekman—ja—hy vash vone weineg golt dat u sall zee den jaar bast—mien got —mien boor merrie—mien got—ik sall nien vind dien like—hy hieft zyns gelyk niet—mien got!— The rage of the whirlwind appeared now to have somewhat passed—and the heavens were covered with troops of flying clouds and wrack like bands hovering on the rear of a retreating and destroying army: the mist was so far dissipated that the path could be perceived, and became easy from the rays of the lanthorn to thride, and indistinct forms of rock and tree were visible before the party as they moved along amid the maze of the forest. After having pursued an irregular and winding route down a narrow and abrupt descent seemingly full of fallen branches, and stumps of destroyed wood, whose oft projecting roots and boughs either rudely overhung or entirely blocked for awhile the way, which the leader was obliged to force for them, they arrived on the brink of a deep and darksome glen, when turning a clump of alder bushes to avoid what appeared from the sound the rush of a powerful fall of waters, but whose flood they could not distinguish in the gloom, (though ever and anon the stray blaze from the light, which was held aloft to guide them, would fall and sparkle upon the jagged fragments of ice that had been driven aside by the force of the stream in its progress, and had got wedged and thrown on the distant crags—where as the lanthorn went by they glowed to living chrystal amid the mist—and changing often with magical swiftness they increased their brilliance to that of diamonds such as hang on a moorish vest,) the travellers perceived immediately before them a dusky line of building wildly situated among the surrounding cliffs, and on the brow of one it was perched—a black and shapeless mass. A few moments, during which the voice of the stranger often bade them tread carefully, brought them before it and allowed them a nearer survey—it was a hovel roughly thrown up and built in the rugged fashion of the backwoodsmen of the period, though mixed as appeared from their casual observation with the form and materials of the wigwam of the untutored savage. The walls as far as they could judge in the darkness, were composed of loose round stone and the trunks of trees, which were carelessly heaped and cemented together by clay or mud, the interstices often filled with dried leaves alone—in many places, crotched stakes thrust in the ground, gave support to the miserable edifice, which was roofed over with the bark and branches of untrimmed brushwood, plucked rudely from the mountain side, with the long, withered and narrow leaves, and even berries, still hanging to them: this thatch, however, was rent and shattered, and large and ragged apertures, were distinctly perceptible; for though the uncomfortable looking habitation was of considerable extent, the eaves and rafters were so low, as to almost touch the ground. The blackened pile also, in several parts, showed plainly the hand of time and desertion, for large pieces of stone had crumbled away, and driven by frequent storms, strewed the earth about with their splintered and broken fragments, affording vacancies in the places they had filled, fit for the ringed and rattled serpent to coil in, and guard its young and poisonous brood: every part of this savage dwelling, appeared wild and ruinous, more like the haunt of the beast of the wilderness, than the residence of man. As the party approached the hovel, they passed several square mounds of earth, built carefully, and overhung with thick mats wrought from rushes, and strongly fenced with a hedge, which protected them from obtruding feet—they were Indian graves— such as the wild follower of the chace hath, in after years sought out, even in the land of their enemy and persecutor, by a weary pilgrimage, whose only land marks, were traditions handed from sire to son; and at whose verdant bases, they've worshipped the last of their oppressed race, lonely and solitary, while their hearts ran o'er in veneration, till they deemed the very spirits of the old to have awakened to their call, and to have smiled upon their holy devotions. The travellers now became sensible of the smell of smoke, which escaped from the dwelling by means of the numerous holes in the rafters above mentioned, and which was blown against them as they advanced, by the gusty wings of the wind—and also from the interior of the hut, they could hear the confused voices of men, intermingled with the deep and hoarse growlings of dogs; and no sooner was the latter grateful sound distinguished by the animal that accompanied their conductor, than he bounded backwards and forwards joyously, as the party 18* drew to the entrance of the building, giving loud and cheerful responses to the barkings of his housed companions: the guide, with rapid strides, having led them through a small enclosure, advanced to the door, which was an uncouth and shapeless opening, but little more than a yard high—and bidding them freely follow him, he bent his tall form, and raising the deer skin mat that secured it, he entered the forlorn mansion—and as to what adventures ensued therein, they are amply narrated in the succeeding section, which is devoted to the purpose. SECTION IV. My name was Captain Kidd, when I sail'd, when I sail'd, My name was Captain Kidd, when I sail'd, My name was Captain Kidd, God's laws I did forbid, And so wickedly I did, when I sail'd.

Old Ballad. A NIGHT IN A RUINED WIGWAM. When the travellers glanced their eyes around the interior of the hovel, the shelter of whose roof they had now attained, they felt that the wigwam presented to their anxious sight, as bare and rude an appearance as its outer aspect: the fire was raised in the centre of the building, which was without a floor or pavement of any kind—and the blazing logs and fallen firebrands, were only kept together by stakes driven into the ground at the four angles, within whose ample bounds the fuel had been laid: the flames, fed with dried brushwood, sent up merrily their bright and brilliant gleams, as though contending and mingling with the black column of smoke which curled aloft, as one exulting in the prospect of freedom, towards a circular hole in the top of the cabin, and through the opening of which, in dusky masses, it rushed tumultuously out unto the atmosphere—or like stragglers from a charging force, scattered in broken clouds, just as it reached the goal of egress—and then it went floating and waving like plumes upon a hearse, that mock death with pomp, along the dark edges of the beams and rafters, which upheld the feeble and miserable roof, seeking flight in every aperture, and eddying in every nook, like sable folds of tapestry stirred by the wind: there was neither window nor space, left ostensibly for the admittance of air, which nevertheless passed with the velocity of a bird, in innumerable currents, that swept fiercely over the bickering blaze, bending its forky and shooting tongues like a young and tender tree, finding its entrance through the numerous crannies and vacancies in the crumbling walls, and other less distinguishable crevices of the decayed tenement: there were doors to the dwelling, both equally uncouth and misshapen—the one by which the party had received admission, and which looked towards the south, and the other exactly opposite, on the northern side of the hut— each of the like dimension, and carefully closed from the weather,—but what principally engaged the attention of the travellers, fatigued and feeble with toil and weakness as they were, was the persons that occupied the wigwam for reclined on various mats, of strange and savage forms and texture, which were outspread around the fire, and close to its heat were eight men, dissimilar in habit, and forbidding in countenance. It was a minute and more, ere the vision of our travellers could pierce the torchless fog around them, which was scarce relieved by the lanthorn borne by their conductor, so as clearly to distinguish the bearing of those in whose company they were thrown—of but one, the garb corresponded with the hunter, or was in the least resemblance to him whom they had encountered in the forest: the attire of the others, were motley and diversified as their complexion; for although the darkened hues of toil and danger predominated on their stern visages, there was seen among these few men, the yellow locks of the European—the black brow of the settler of the tropical isles, and the curled hair and broad flat features of the dusky African: there was, however, somewhat of a slight uniformity in one particular, in which five of this group assimilated; in the midst of the wild mixture of which their dress partook, there was that which savoured the following of the sea, rather than the peaceful pursuit of the chase; and indeed, save one, who from his mantle and straps, coarse hood and wallet, had much the look of some itinerant trader—all the rest appeared armed to the very teeth, not as men bent on healthful exercise and lawful occupation, but as fearful of hazard, and prepared for desperate encounters and resistance: in their appearance alone, there was something likely to create alarm and distrust to the eye, and unfavourable impression to the mind, of those who viewed them: several had their musquetoons resting on their knees—the pistolets of others bristled in their belts at the side of a long knife, or naked dagger, which was peculiar to the times, and of the shape of that which is termed by the Spaniards of the main, machete; added to these was seated on the ground, with his elbow resting on his knee, smoking a pipe whose stem was of cane carved and painted, a man whose deep olive complexion and beardless lip, proclaimed the aboriginal origin and race from whom he sprung—his garments and looks were barbarous in the extreme—a blanket of many curious dies, was girt about his waist by strings of leather, and thrown loosely like a mantle, over his shoulders; he also wore a sort of trowsers, or rather leggins, likewise of blanket, laced tightly with deer gut, and on his feet were mocassins made of moose hide; his face and breast, the latter of which, was naked and uncovered, were scored by numerous hideous streaks, and wild, fantastic and rude cut figures, in paint of a reddish hue, through which, nevertheless, often his natural swarthy colour could be easily discerned; a bare and narrow pointed knife, hung by a string from his neck, and there depended on his back, a pouch of bison horn, which probably contained either his powder or tobacco—glittering bracelets of silver, were fastened about his wrist, and on his breast, rested a gorget of copper; pendants of beautiful and varied beads, were affixed not only to his ears, the gristle of which was split nearly round, and hung with ornaments in the form of some unknown bird or beast of the wilderness, but also to his nose, which was bored through for the purpose; his head was shaven of hair, except of one long, lank, coal black tuft, that fell down his back sweeping the very earth on which he sat; and was tastefully divided into several parcels and twisted strings, each of which was stiffened and intermingled with divers shining beads of a cylindrical shape, and curious feathers of different hues, the whole being clubbed, wound, and connected together, in one strange mass; there were strings of wampum, made of white and black shells, artfully mingled and interwoven in his belt collar and blanket; a tomahawk was carelessly stuck in his girdle, and at his side also, like to his companions, was laid a musquetoon—and lastly, close by the fire, stood a boy of lithe and slender stature, scantily and barely habited in a cloak and doublet, tattered and worn nearly to the woof, so that it appeared scarcely to protect him from the cold, from which he seemed to suffer severely, as he shiveringly drooped over a living bed of coals, tending the slow progress of several steaks of venison that were broiling thereon, yet reeking from the slaughtered body of a grey and noble buck, whose bloodstained carcass was cast stiff and stark with death, in a recess of the hovel—the remote and farther portions of which, were scarce discerned by the most searching eye, although here and there in its distant corners, undefined and formless masses were eked out in rude and strange shapes and heaps, to the ever busy and wild paintings and imaginings of fancy. The quick and eager hum of voice and conversation, which had loudly sounded in mingled confusion, at the entrance of the wayworn travellers, was suddenly stilled in silence as they advanced and were perceived: two or three of the men hastily started from their recumbent postures, and stared rudely at those, whom possibly they considered as intruders, and then turned and whisperingly discoursed with their companions, gazing alternately with sharp and fierce glances, which betokened in appearance violence, rather than good will or welcome; and the intention borne by their countenances, seemed only dubious of action and restraint for the moment—while at the same time, as if partaking of the savage and inhospitable feelings of their masters, two grim, gaunt hounds, gnashing their tusks, sprang crossly from where they were couching, towards the approachers—but awed by the well-known and stern tone of the guide who led the party, the ferocious animals sank their heads and paused, disappointed and growling, midway in their career: of all, the Indian alone was apparently most unmoved—for merely turning his eyes for an instant, as the noise caused by their advance in the hut met his hearing, with a slow and listless movement, (which nevertheless, like the flashing of the fire-fly's wings, reflected brightly to the blaze near which he sat, his sparkling and trembling ornaments,) he resumed his first attitude, with an air of total unconcern, indifference and abstraction, which appeared impenetrable and unaffected, by the event of the passing moment. The hunter now hastily singled out from this assemblage, a slender made man of diminutive height, with sharp pointed features, that had a peculiar expression which conveyed to the remarker, feelings of an indefinite cast, that left predominant an impression dubious as to the character he might bear in life, yet certainly unfavourable as to his temper—for he bore that strongly marked and bitter frown on his brow, that bespoke passion uncontrolled and unrestrained—violent anger, that would outleap discretion's bounds, and leagued with unpitying hate, war even to the death: and there were with these, many and deep furrows ploughed in his forehead, wrought by the power of stern and darksome thought—while, withal, there was in his manner and movements, something that betokened an acquaintance with the courteous rules of the world, somewhat above the sphere in which he was acting, and beyond the rude and offensive bearing of his companions,—for although a surly scowl, at first had contracted his sallow visage as he viewed the persons who had entered within the wigwam, to a look of ferocity, that spoke as it were of joy or triumph, such as when the foul falcon, loosed from its confining jesses, soars aloft and singles its prey, stretching its blood-thirsty beak in pursuit—yet having briefly exchanged a few words with their conductor, but in so low a tone that they reached not the anxious ears of the travellers, while from the significant glances and gestures that passed, they were led to believe he was detailing their destitute situation, this personage, after a moment's hesitation, in which he probably was determining on the course to pursue, came forward as principal of those present, and greeted the wanderers who had thus been thrown on his hospitality, in a voice of kindness. Certes, the personal appearance of this man, differed as much from the savage looking attendants who surrounded him, as did the elevation of his carriage—and savoured a little of the authority which he evidently exercised over this wild and singular company, whose muscular and athletic figures, might have vied with the banditti of the Apulia, which the captive Salvator Rosa loved so well to paint; his jerkin was gaudily and profusely trimmed with tarnished lace,—thrown negligently over his shoulder, he wore a cloak whose colours had once been of the gayest court hue—but frequent exposure to the weather, had dimmed and faded it, equally with the embroidery, that seamed in what once had been richness, the other portions of his dress; on his head, he had a small cocked hat, ornamented with deep gold fringe, with a long Spanish plume drooping downwards; a belt about his waist girt a small hanger and a pair of pistolets. “It is needless for me to speak that you are welcome, cavaliers, when your wants claim such assistance,” said he, tempering a countenance not ill favoured—though every line roughened by the fatigue and endurance of storms, as well as by habitual indulgence of the coarsest passions, “by the 'stress we have known ourselves, we are ready to divide our tortunes—you is a brave beast we have slain, and the mess is large enough to spare a part.” And yet as he spoke, the younger traveller deemed that there flashed on him a sinister glance of peculiar and daring inquiry, from the small grey eye of the host, that was not only irksome, but threatening to him on whom it turned, and almost belied the free and generous reception which he was striving to extend by words. Room was now made at the fire—than which, a more pleasant sight could not have been offered to the frozen and wearied frames of the rescued travellers—and as their hosts heaped fresh wood on the flames, through which the forky blaze mounted, licking the sides of the branches it destroyed, like the darting adder—every nerve of their outworn bodies, felt the grateful return of strength: the genial and friendly heat, seemed almost to renew the very sources of life, which had nearly been extinct—and the blood flew freely in its accustomed currents in their veins—yet the cold, as it retreated from their flesh, left an agony inscrutable; every bone seemed to tingle and smart, as pierced by a thousand thorns; but slowly the pain and anguish that thus severely rent them, departed; and from their escape, they laboured under no detriment except weakness, while the past terrors of the elements, which had so nigh been fatal, grew as it were a dream; for such is life, one hour after the deadliest pass that we have thrided, even with narrow warding of breath or limb—it seemeth but a vision—a thing to be remembered as having known, but whose agonies, which, while passing, was scarce to be endured—but after, grow faint in recollection, and is only thought on as sickness in the fairest hour of health, or as the past storm to the mariner in safety, whose dangers cannot deter from new adventure:— Vol. I. 19 but nevertheless, though guarded from the immediate and pressing ill, that had so late overhung them with death, by the unlooked for obtainment of shelter, the mind of the younger traveller was but little at ease; for many and painful were the feelings that rushed upon him, and distressful to his enjoyment of that rest, of which both his body and mind stood in so much need— he was a stranger in the land—the service imposed on his bearing, was of the most important nature—such, that in the present convulsed state of the king's colony of New-Yorke, while the spirit of the time raged at its height, in even a country so desolate and uncivilized— should it be known to a foe, and who were such, he had scarce the means to distinguish, it might cost his life— but that was not in his thought so much, as the failure of the business, which to his country, to him, was of the utmost moment; and still, well was he aware that the wild and outlawed, the lawless and blood-thirsty, roamed at large and unrestrained; for he was in the land of the savage red men—and of the white, more barbarous than these; here the pirate, in defiance of the world, made his home—and many were the desperate convicts, who had been sent to till the earth, and pierce this wilderness, when their deeds of crime had cast them from their native land—a pathless, unknown and interminable desert, was around, the lair of the most destructive animals, or of human creatures more untamed; and with these he was now mated—there was that which fed suspicion—cherishing and adding to fear, rather than diminishing, the more he viewed them—the fierce looks, the rude and daring glances, the familiar and singular manner of him who appeared superior, were all calculated to inspire disgust and secret foreboding, rather than ease and confidence; and the observer as he gazed, was conscious of an involuntary shudder that crept upon him: and when his eye ran over the remote, indistinct and smoky recesses of the wigwam, from which, in case it should prove that he was betrayed in hostile hands, he saw no escape living, save at the will of his entertainers. From such painful reflections, he was shortly aroused by the serving of food, which at a signal, was placed before the assemblage by the boy, to whom was given the most servile duties; he fulfilled them with a stupid and nervous air, that called forth frequent and vociferous reproofs and curses, from the savages on whom he tended—and once or twice, the attention was drawn to the helpless creature, by blows, which for some slight negligence, he received from his brutal masters—and which he bore in sullen silence—indeed so vacant and lustreless was the gaze, and the careless patience with which he endured this ill treatment, as to lead to a supposition that his intellect was injured by long, harsh usage—for his features, which, though thin and pale, seemed naturally handsome and delicate, were distorted by an unsettled and simple expression, that savoured of idiocy—which, though not confirmed on inquiry, still it was learnt that the unfortunate youth was destitute in nearly an equal degree, being totally deprived of the faculty of hearing. “The lousy dog,” said the person who has been designated as the principal of the group, “maketh no lie of the old saw—for he that is born to wear a hempen necklace, never drank death from salt water: you must see, my masters, that we, that's you hard faced knaves, and myself—thof we are sporting ashore now, with these lubbers of the land, follow old ocean from our choice; well, it so chanced that the balindra, that I commanded some two years since, was laid aboard in the very stream of the gulf, by a terrific blow, through which the oldest seaman scarce hoped to see her live—by my soul, the waves rolled down upon us, as thof the clouds were falling—the wind piped shrill along the shrouds, with voice that woke despair—and on the angry deep the bark fluttered like a dying bird.” “By the beard of Rubens, what a picture it would have made—I vow by my halidome, I would have given a year's life to have been there, to catch the subject—a sea storm—heavens filled with flashes—white capped waves—the wreck parting in pieces—drowning mariners, in the style of Schellinks—no, from nature itself, by Jost Stoll,” broke out the ensign, catching fire from the idea. “Well sirs,” continued the narrator, scarce heeding the interruption, “morning came at last—we had weathered the gale, thof shattered and mastless; not so it seems did another vessel, who, ere the sun went down, lay to our windward—but of which, at day-break, there was no vestige—yet as we lay too, repairing, there came floating by, that which might once have been a goodly spar, but then so splinted and broken that it scarce buoyed from death a shapeless creature, that hung to it as an infant to its mother—we fished it up, and saved the springal, who, with his sullen humours and useless ear, but ill repays the trouble of his rescue.” “By the pencil of Sir Godfrey,” exclaimed the soldier, “the urchin has a good face, though—a sketch in a loose, careless, masterly manner, of his head—hair dishevelled, rags floating, would not make such a bad specimen—an excellent companion to the gipsy boy by Kneller, on my faith—he's in a fine position—it wont do to lose the outlines—sit still, youngster, and I'll immortalize you in my fuelle.” So saying, the eager amateur drew forth his tablets and crayons, and in spite of his situation, weariness, and that which he had encountered, in a minute, forgetful of all about him, and wrapt in his employment, so that he remarked not the frown of his comrade, he was as busily engaged as if his very existence depended on the accuracy of his delineation. The fare, though coarse and ill cooked, fatigue and hunger that accompanied, rendered palatable—it was roughly placed on wooden vessels of Indian make, which might probably have been left by the last inhabitant of the wigwam; and they were forced to carve with knives and dirks, which they took from their belts. When the meal was finished, to the surprise of the travellers, a keg of spirits was rolled forward, and each one as he chose, helped himself with large and eager draughts of the potent liquid. Until now, there had been an unwilling and somewhat constrained intercourse, and but few interchange of words, with most of this party and their guests—which had been felt by the latter, as peculiarly unencouraging and alarming, to men in their destitute condition; but as the cup passed freely one to another, much of the cold and forbidding manners of the hosts, departed beneath its influence: they no longer spoke apart in low tones, nor gazed with ireful and audacious eyes, at the persons who had entered their circle, possibly against their will; while soon the gay wassail reigned of such whose days are spent in hardy toil, and to whom each enjoyment is more cheerful and precious, as it is seldom and brief. The savage alone was silent, and seemed from the first, to hold little or no conversation with the rest; he ate and drank apart unnoticed by his companions, who showed indeed no disposition to disturb him. The liquor was copiously used and quaffed almost undiluted, yet it appeared to have but a transient effect on the hardened frames of the drinkers, and although the coarse joke and unrestrained burst of merriment made the very building ring, yet little else than what fell from the lips of the person who has been mentioned as appearing a superior, could be gathered by the younger traveller, as to the character of the entertainers—yet there were some things that graved suspicions and contradicted the account he had given—there was an acquaintance with the hut—there were stores and conveniencies which it afforded, that led unconsciously to the belief that it was not the temporary shelter represented, but that the same persons had assembled at an appointed meeting, beneath its roof before: and then their language and discourse, though doubtful and ambiguous, was too often garnished with vile obscenity and horrid execrations, and larded with dark and obscure phrases, which were eked forth with too significant, though to the observer, unintelligible gestures, not to impress with unfavourable sentiments—and truly, as the strong, broad red light of the fire, with its irregular splendour glared duskily on the swarthy, uncouth, savage, and storm beaten visages of those who crowded round it, throwing its vivid lustre on portions of the desperate looking features, and rendering harsher the rough lines of countenance, as they were 19* backed by the strong and gloomy shades of the apartment, all forcibly struck the alarmed and startled imagination of the guest, as if he looked on a darksome crowd of demons, carousing in their midnight and subterraneous vault, or on a troop of evil spirits, as they flitted rejoicingly about the furnace of the cabalist. “Another subject on my troth,” said the delighted Jost Stoll, as he chanced to glance his eye around him, “what a fortunate artist I am—as sure as I kissed the hand of his sacred majesty, this is a group that beats all Salvator ever painted—I must not lose this opportunity—give me nature before your copyists. By my halidome! what lights, what shadows are here—divine art I thank thee for this enjoyment.” On the side of the fire, opposite to where the younger traveller was placed, sat, however, a man over whom the liquor was now fast gaining a triumph, and going far to remove the caution with which his comrades evidently governed. From the long, repeated, and unsparing potations which he had swallowed, he was already at that stage of inebriation when the mind, unsettled and wayward, flies from one thing to another, and if in the least opposed in its wild career, becomes displeased, and the tongue noisy and quarrelsome with every thing it meets to vent itself on. The person of this man, though somewhat bloated, was muscular, bony, and square made, and being a little undersized, he apparently joined that bodily activity and sinew which combines such prodigious advantage in close conflict; his face was naturally unprepossessing, sunburnt and freckled, while numerous blotches and reddish streaks about his cheeks and nostrils, proclaimed his propensity to debauchery; long grizzled and projecting eyebrows overhung like a beetling rock his small sharp grey eyes, the expression of which was extremely inauspicious; his hair and mustachios were of a deep red cast; he was clad in a long jerkin of brown cloth, and doublet of the same material, about his waist was a buff belt, in which were placed numerous weapons of violence—he had been for some time engaged in earnest discourse with the only peaceable looking and unarmed man of the party, who has been mentioned above, and who was reclining on a mat next to him; heretofore the words that had passed between them were uttered so low as only to be heard by him to whom they were addressed; but at this period the drunken ruffian attracted the notice of all by the sound of a voice as disagreeable as his physiognomy, and whose screech-owl notes were heard above the loudest of the others, like the voice of the tempest above the waves of the sea. “The foul fiend give thee his benison,” said he, “you make yourself as much at home as you were in your hole by Cherry Garden; curse thee, an hast treated me as in the last voyage—do you hear what I say? that is, if the pieces lack weight; that is, if they are some o' you're damn clipper's coin—do you mind me? I'll capsize your fleshless carcass like a shallop in the trough of the sea.” “On the word of an honest man,” returned the other, who had a face like an adze, and a voice that shrunk in his throat to a groan, with awe of the person he addressed, and at the same time that he spoke he edged himself away from his disagreeable neighbour, “may I never be a fence to a highbinder again, an I ha' not fairly done by thee. I ha' been in the trade this eighteen years and upwards, and in my worse times ha' been an honest man— I've a character to lose; my reputation all know is, in the way of business, irreproachable—I ha' ne'er yet cut the quid—no, on my honour, thou hast not one sop o' cogniac in the boottle—I'll take my oath at assize, before my friend Dirk Von Rikkettee, an you like, that I ha' done right by thee.” “The devil rot you, skinflint,” cried the first, “I'll stake a bowl of bomboo that you have wronged me, sin you swear contrary—howsomever, I'll take a drink first—for you are a damn'd rogue, you know you are; you always douse helm when you should not, and thof you may talk it well—what's your palaver worth? not a rope yarn, for don't I know you? you are as great a picaroon on land as the old man is on the ocean—you know who I mean.” And jerking up one shoulder, he gave a meaning leer with his eyes, throwing them on one side towards the direction where the principal of the party stood. A hearty laugh from most of the company followed, but a deep frown darkened the face of the superior. “Come, boys,” said he, “you have forgotten our agreement. Gabriel, these matters are such as it would be proper for you to defer talking on; there are more fitting places and times.” “Damn it, an't we ashore?” replied the man, whose intemperance had overcome whatever obedience he at other times possessed, “now or never I'll make him settle—there's no bamboozling Gabriel Loffe; who knows but the knave to-morrow may dance with a halter for his cravat, and leave his debts to be collected; no curse it, the ghost of Tom More, captain, shall not hinder me from getting what he owes me.” “Rascal! another word like that—” “You need not look so squally on me,” continued Loffe in a surly tone, the dogged obstinacy of his nature increased by drinking, “I am one, you know, that always speaks my mind; none of your skulking under hatches for me:—I am sworn by the bread and the wine—and I am bold to say, thof you are master aboard there, there's not rover's law, but you've an equal in a swabber ashore. And do you see now, you need not think I'm drunk—I can tell when a man calls me rascal, an he means offence —so I am one that says, if the cord will fit a man's neck he should not disdain to have it tied—thof damme, I have sailed the sea since staunch old Morgan burnt the rancharias, at Panama, and there never was the breeze that blew me a rascal from man's mouth, unless he felt the point of a handspike—rascal! the lubber who makes so free with dirty colours, mostly fights under his own flag—I a'nt drunk when I say that, curse me!” “Dog! do you dare mutiny and—” shouted the other, while his cheek glowed with ire, and his brows met as he fixed his eye sternly on the insolent ruffian, while at the same time he hurridly thrust his right hand towards the handle of his pistolet, leaving his speech unfinished with a sudden and startling pause, drawing in his lips, which were blanched to an ashen hue, so that his teeth were shown set strongly together as in deadly rage, “thy life, thy heart's blood, dog.” Yet, however, ere he could pursue the action implied, the event of which would have probably from appearances proved bloody and fatal, one of the party who was wrapped in a dark sea cloak and had been silently viewing the passing scene, abruptly started from the mat on which he lay, and rising in an instant to his feet with a quick, true, and nervous blow felled the savage Loffe like a log to the earth. “Lie you there, knave as you are,” exclaimed the conqueror, “until the padre gives you un bula de defunctos, for your peccadilloes. Santo Espiritu, learn, thou stupid buey, to keep thy mouth close as a caulked deck, nor hoist sail thus at random withouten compass or rudder.” Loffe, though borne down by the power of his antagonist's arm, was merely stunned for a moment—he rose again immediately, like the wounded tiger lashed with the strength of fury; the blow had sobered him, and as he felt the warm blood rush in a current from his head and trickle down his face, his every limb trembled with revenge and hate—his hand flew to his belt, and the bared blade of the long knife shone in the light of the fire as he flourished it before him. “Comrades, messmates,” roared he in a voice of thunder, while his eyes glared with the frenzy of a demoniac, “will you keep to the leeward, and let me be murdered like our gunner—curse it, we can take 'vantage of the king's proclamation, so he that's a man let him show his steel, and win Bass' golden Jacobuses.” Two or three only ranged at his side, and grasped their hangers with dark and gloomy visages—the others sternly clenched their long and glittering cutlasses or raised the deadly musquetoon, and awaited the superior's commands. There was a brief and fearful pause, which, however, was broken by the master's darting between the adverse parties, and seizing the mutineer by the throat with the grasp of a lion, while he levelled the weapon he hastily snatched from his girdle at his head. “By God!” he cried, in a loud tone, “he that makes the least advance in this brawl, shall roll a corse at my feet. Why this is serpent-like—have I not glutted ye with gold, and would ye devour me? Sooth, ye are brave sparks! put up your arms, dare to disobey, and may my soul broil in hell but I will feed on the heart of him that refuses—and thou, villain, foul-faithed slave, that would bite the hand that feeds thee, an thou darest longer grumble or threaten one word of treachery, damn thee, sot, be ye in liquor or not, thy brains shall be as water beneath my heel, which thus will I trample on.” He flung the heavy frame of the brutal Loffe from him, while either awed by his determined manner, or moved by a sense of returning duty, scarce had he finished speaking, ere, with one accord, every offensive weapon was silently returned to its place by the rest; however, over the countenance of the ringleader, a malignant look, that betokened his spirit still unquelled and ready to brave the worst to satisfy revenge, yet remained; but no one appeared to second him, so contending with his feelings, as far as not to renew the contest on such unequal grounds, with a slow step and in sullen silence he withdrew himself to the darkest part of the wigwam, where, having thrown himself on the earth, his discontented and heated mind brooded over its imaginary wrongs. It was astonishing how quick all was tranquillized; scarce a minute passed and no trace of quarrel remained; those who but a while before had thirsted for each other's gore, and who with scornful eye had exchanged ireful looks of mortal hatred, and the stern defiance of deadly war, were again calmly sitting side by side, and drank from the same cup like brethren in love. The broil had died away like a thought, and was forgotten; the master alone deemed it necessary to make some explanation to the travellers for passages which had evidently alarmed them; Jost Stoll had paused in his pursuit, and stood up with one hand holding his tablets, and the other placed on the hilt of his sword, as about to rush in the fray and part the combatants; his comrade had also taken to the last movement, but started in anxious suspense on the words that fell from the lips of the engaged parties; the master had observed this, and he was sensible the unruly conduct of his wild associates was fast rendering abortive his designs. “We are a mad, strange set of fellows,” said he, “but cavaliers, you will not think the worse of it, if you have marked as much of mankind as I have; the hand that is nearest the steel grasps the warmer from the heart— I hate the man who knows no change like Hecla's snow, but—by hell this is not the first time the drunken brute hath wrought disturbance, and let him beware,” he raised his voice “lest he tempt mine anger once too often—you see, sirs, how needful for a man who would command that he forget his nature even to tyranny. I do regret it, yet else, these wretches would tread me to dust; sooth. I wonder not the best have forgot in such a state their meekness, for where is the man who could gaze on treason open-eyed and let it destroy him, no, the breath of mutiny should be stilled in death, and may my soul fry in hell-fire, if on such provocation, I refrain from the extent.” “By my halidome,” interrupted Stoll, with his usual quickness and lack of caution, “it runneth in my mind your argument is erroneous; by the bye a painting of a duello or single fight might do very well, though there would be a want of figures, yet that might be supplied in scenery; but natheless, master, although I am a soldier, and have seen blood, I cannot agree with you that a mutineer should be slain unless after fair trial, and I just think me of a case exact in point: there's that rascal Kid, the rover, against whom the statute of outlawry is in force: I have no dubitation, that were he once in the purlieus of Newgate, that the murders committed against his comrades would weigh as much at Old Bailey to get him a Tyburn blessing, an the worst of his piracies, bad as they are.” During this dissertation of the ensign, the sallow visage of the person whom he addressed, underwent various changes; at the first, he turned peevishly and hastily from the speaker, while his lip curled with contemptuous impatience, and his brows gathered darkly: ere, however, Stoll had ended, his attention became attracted, and he gazed on him with a look, suddenly, as though he would have read the very soul of the soldier; but apparently, his curiosity found but little satisfaction to requite that which had aroused it—for in an instant after, as though being conscious of having betrayed some weakness, he withdrew his eye, and walked slowly backwards and forwards through the hovel. “Santa Madre, si Senor,” said the seaman, beneath whose prowess Loffe had fallen, while a smile of singular expression lurked about the corners of his mouth, “that's to say, d'ye see, I am under the same tack in that wind as you are—Cielo!—'tis hard smothering a man in his own hammock—for the hound—Kid I mean—this is between decks,” winking humorously “as great a scoundrel as he may be, hath those on this side of the water, seeing as how you are from abroad, and an't like to know these things—that wish him fair seas and a ballast of gold and silver—but as for me, carra! I would sort the perro a round dozen a-day, from his own cat well laid on amidships, and damme, if that does not sink a man, his sky scraper will always swim above water.” “But the old hunks would'nt be so bad either, did he not sing long Ben Bridgeman's song to his crew,forty shares of booty to his own locker, and damned a peeling of the cable to his men” muttered a coarse and swarthy faced man, with a loud, gruff voice, that sounded like the notes of a dying bear. “Grant ye, David Mullins—grant you, he is of the true fox breed; while he takes venison, hide and tallow, he cares not how his followers quarrel for the ten branchings of the antlers,” responded one in the dress of a hunter. “Ay, the old boy's commission is a broad one—there's not a ferret hawker that has cruised about Cape Cormorin, that knows the weight of a piece of Arabian gold like him,” said another. “Nor is there a cutter, but he can bilk him with damaged muslins and romels from Cutshean,” joined in the smooth, lean personage, who had been Loffe's first adversary. The master stopped abruptly in his walk, and gazed on the speakers, “By God—this is Judas like,” he spoke in a low tone, that became more pointed and bitter as he proceeded, and rolled to the startled ear, like thunder while distant—“when the cur hath his bone to lick, should he growl? should the slave refuse to how the knee to him who gives him bread? dare the groveling ground worm writhe against the heel that spares its miserable existence? dogs! what are ye? was it not for me—on my soul it doth amuse one, to see the forked tongue of the snake spit out venom against the bosom that cherished it”—his dark eyes dilated, and his words swelled with the deep energy of stifled passion—yet recollection of a sudden, moved him, and he withdrew his extended arm, and relaxed the strong clenching of his hand, and looking more calmly around, he turned to the travellers “sooth, it wearies my patience,” he continued, “to see grown men act thus the ways of childhood. Sirs, ye have prudence, and can well deem how rash these light, ill judged sayings, come from the mouths of mariners—men whose lives are of the sea—whose very breath is at the risk of storm and steel—and ye know we cannot have more caution than is wanted—for who marks what ear listens? there are many of us here, strangers, asking your pardon—yonder forester, too, a few hours since we knew not, and we have met and joined company in his native woods—and there is a sad warning in the tale that's abroad—ye have doubtless heard it, how Kid tricked the Dutchman off Bonavis—the thick headed fool in a possada at the Madeiras, had reviled the free trader, scarce believing who was near—so by God, when he took him, he reckoned scores on his hide; the rover hoisted the boaster and his crew—ran them up the main yard by the arms, and then burnt their vessel Vol. I. 20 to the water's edge;[45] [45] Vide Kid's Trial, where there is not only a repetition of many of his acts of cruelty, but also there will be found many of the terrific expressions which he was accustomed to use in his violent fits of passion, and which are here rather softened down than heightened. and may my soul be damned, if he served them not rightly—what say you, ha?” He broke off, and glanced his eyes around with a stern and savage look, while his lawless looking followers, stricken as with awe, answered not a word in return, but gazed silently in each other's faces as men who have fearlessly, rashly, and unaware of the danger, strolled beneath the sparkling base of an avalanche, and behold it tottering above them, ready to crush with death at the slightest whisper even of their fears; and each recoiled from the anger that had been roused, like the bold skater of the north, who in confidence and hardihood, braves the fast rotting bosom of the ice, that binds the cold visage of some wintry stream, and hears the hollow creak and groan of the frail crystal that upholds him, which seems parting asunder as he glides:—a pause followed, the Indian raised his head with a slow action, and bending his body gracefully after his wild fashion of address, as the noble top of some verdant tree, stirred to motion by the gentle southern breeze that wantons in the living forest, he spoke— “Yonnondio,† † A word of respect used by the Indians of the Five Nations in addressing a white warrior. hearken to the voice of the White Skinned Beaver; my words fly to reach your ear. Listen Yonnondio, Areouski hath stricken with the red hatchet even to the roots of my name—the blood of my house wets the ground at Sankikani‡ ‡ Indian name for Haverstraw. —I am a desolate man; the Great Spirit only knows why I live, for I am like a blasted hemlock; the winds of the tempest have bared the pride of my branches—I am dead from the top; my generation, my race hath gone by—my ancient fire is extinguished— but though my heart is sick, the rain of the black cloud is not in my eyes; yet these are the deeds of a red man— his mouth was a snare, for the friendship of his lips was as sweet as the sagamite, but the roots of his tongue were bitter—and now the ashes of my wigwam, and the bones of my kin are blown towards the setting sun; his knife left not a dog to call me master; my pirouge hath swam the stormy waters of the Shatamuck,[46] [46] Indian name of the Hudson River. as swift as the flight of the red bird—for three days and three nights did I follow in the blood-stained tracks of his retreat, with an eye sharpened like the lynx, a foot like the deer, and an arm like the great bear of the Apalachian hills, and the last sun went down, while the wind howled over the beaver blanket of the Black Buffalo, and the desert wolf sang his death song; his blood is not dry on my hatchet— Yonnondio, though the words of mine enemy hath stung my ear to the quick with the bite of the rattlesnake, the White Skinned Beaver had not sought his life, for such madness is not the commands of the Great Spirit, but of Kitchi Manitou—but he drank the blood of my name, both sannup and squaw—yet white man, I rejoice not over the body of my foe, for he died like a warrior.” The red man ceased and replaced the calumet to his lips. “By God! I doubt me but the heathen dog hath some wit in his speech,” said the master, after a minute's pause, “Indian, thou hast not spoken wrong; I feel it doth not become, that is, it is going far to take life for a quick word alone—but have I not been driven to it?” continued he, in a lower tone, as communing with himself and disregarding the presence of others, “By God, I say, I have been forced to do that which I have done; but it matters not. I do not care so much for the death of my gunner, as for other passages in my voyage—for I have good friends in England who will bring me off.” The buccaneer (for such he was) measured a short distance with a pensive tread, as one buried in serious thought, at last he fronted his guests. “Our discourse hath taken an over strange tack,” said he, “that may not guile a wearisome man. Sirs, your stress hath, craving your mercy, been but sadly looked to; but Olyve shall outlay your couches—coarse ones, forsooth, and lacking little invitation to rest; but wot ye gentles, ye are not in a lady's bower.” He made a hasty signal to the boy, who, laying on the ground at a distance from his rude masters, seemed as banquetting on a brief moment of ease, snatched from his hard and servile toilings, he arose, when he caught the master's eye; but approached sullen and discountented, and as he conducted the travellers in pursuance to the rover's directions, his step was unwilling and his countenance scowled with displeasure, and he appeared moved with the angry feelings of petulent childhood in the execution of an unwelcome command—Sullenly he flung a few mats on the ground, and pointed to each his separate place of rest. “A right soldier's bed this, comrade, as I live,” quoth Ensign Stoll, “yet on my halidome, there never was a picture in better keeping. Why now this wild pallet, whereon I am about to stretch my aching bones, would make as exquisite a model for—death and the devil, springald, what are you about?” The boy, who had been busied with apparently great reluctance in assisting to adjust and gather the wide flowing cloak of the soldier round his brawny shoulders, ere he cast himself on the destined spot for his repose, had at the moment of the exclamation unloosened the leathern belt that supported the ensign's rapier—who as he spoke beheld the weapon in the grasp of the disobliging urchin, who had undone the buckles, however, with so sly and cautious an action, as scarce to be perceptible to the wearer. The stripling was in some confusion, whatever were his intentions in possessing himself of the steel, when detected; but resuming confidence almost instantly, he with an insolent motion and unchanging countenance gave to understand that it appeared a slight on the entertainers that the guests should encumber themselves with their arms—and that if resigned to him they should be well cared for. “We are vowed men, be where we may, to retain our defence at hand,” said the younger traveller expressively, and at the same time putting back the arm of the officious stripling, that had approached to the pistolets in his girdle, “that light blade will not inconvenience or hinder my fellow here from one moment's repose—and as for these barkers of mine, young friend, they were polished by Wynkyne of Hainault, an expert artisan, who charged me with peculiar care of them.” The boy recoiled and disappointed gave back from the soldier's touch; but not, however, without venting a half formed sound of anger and spiteful rage, in which it seemed as if nature contended against incapacity of utterance, with a force nearly of mastery—while, as he retired, as though to make up for words, a malicious and threatening look clouded his visage, with a mischievous and gloomy meaning, savouring of that wicked gratification and elvish glee with which one of the swart goblins of German story, might have gloated on some sleeping infant, ere with its bony and sinewy fingers it pressed the life from the tender and unguarded throat of the unconscious child. The traveller marked the lurking devil of the urchin's eye—but the gaze of the hosts was on them, and he could but whisper unperceived a brief caution to Jost Stoll not to close his sight, but which that worthy scarce heeded, being thoroughly overpowered and exhausted; for not a moment after he stretched his jaws with a yawn to their utmost width, and having tossed and tumbled about in vain, and seeming unconscious from weariness, of comprehending his companion's suspicions, he was fain soon to yield to a slumber deep and overwhelming, the most decided tokens of which were announced by long and heavy breathings, whose music was strengthened by certain variations or notes that wound through his nostrils and sounded not unlike the long winded drone with which some warlike moscheto sounds his battle call about the face of the feverish sleeper, ere he uses his hungry spear. Although there was not a limb of the younger traveller but what trembled with pain, and required all the refreshening succour that slumber could bestow for a renewal of vigour—yet so troubled, anxious, and awakened was his 20* mind by the events that he had but a short period before witnessed, together with the situation in which he was, at the mercy of beings who to him appeared as tameless and uncurbed by the ties of law or nature, as the waves they were wont to plough—that he forced himself to combat against that now necessary indulgence of sleep, which hung over him in very mockery, like the phantom waters of the dry and parched desert, which flow with gentlest ripple, that might lull the storm worn mariner, to the eye of the eager and deceived pilgrim, who with high hopes and renovated strength rushes to the shadowy shore to bathe his heated brow and slake his burning thirst—but finds sand alone—scorching sand and bitter death: yea, his pulse and temples throbbed with feverish and restless anxiety, like the bull when worried and driven by the javelins of the sportsman of the corrida del toros. Indeed, the perils by which he was evidently encompassed, were a sufficient cause of watchfulness; for however he might at first have hesitated on the object and character of his entertainers, momently every latent doubt disappeared, and it was not possible to mark unmoved, the disgusting mixture of impertinent curiosity, barefaced hardihood, and ruffian surliness of the manner and conversation of these men; all was convincing in a bosom the least prone by circumstance to suspicion: and now he could not shut out the fearful reality that closed about him—with a quick and ghastly eye he gazed upon the stern and savage forms that moved in the red gleams that shot in vividness from the fire—and as the strong light bronzed the hardy visages and gloomy brows of those who ministered in its radiance, a hundred accidents rendered certain the truth of his fearful and desperate fancies. The rumour had ran abroad that the blood stained pirate, the rover Kid, was in a distant sea; in that confidence he had landed—but now the thought was blighting and searing as a blast of death, and yet he could not banish it—for there was the motlied garb—the deep swarthy and sunburnt hue of countenance—the wild reverly and reckless riot that were ascribed to the free trader and his followers—and then for him there was no escape. A thousand times better, he mentally acknowledged, had he died, perished, and now lay a frozen stark corpse in the snow, than thus to drain to the dregs the bitterness of despair, and await the descending sword which by a single hair hung above him, like that which dropped o'er the head of the luxurious Syracusan. “Were it possible,” thought he, “to destroy these papers, could I effect that, my own blood were scarce worth avenging.” He thrust his hand in his bosom, and shot a quick glance around the dusky hovel—the view was cheerless and without comfort—the idea—the wish, that prompted the act, was as false and fatal, as that which urges the spirit of the wicked Moslemite, to rise at the call of the two angels that wait upon the sepulchre, and forswear his faith—for darkness like death, came o'er his heart, as his sight drank in the scene; he gazed sadly on the black and rugged walls—they were as chains to bind him prisoner in the uttermost moment of danger—his heart sank—and when his eye rested on the tall figures that stalked like giant shadows before him, his imagination became excited, and wandered as in a feverish dream; and he could scarce refrain from believing, that as he looked on them, their forms distended and enlarged, and their features grew sterner—and that every glance they threw towards him, was savage, and threatening murther; his hand quitted the vellum, and slid with involuntary haste to the haft of his sword— “There is no chance against such fearful odds,” said he to himself firmly, “if I have fallen in the snare they've set, at least I will die as a man: some few of these dogs shall never read the neck verse, if my arm weakens not in the encounter, and this good steel serves me as wont.” There is a fascination, that at the trying hours of men's lives, seizes as with a grasp of fate upon their intellect— they are dead—they become powerless, and watch without a care, to evade the instrument of destruction that creeps gradually from its concealment, in their view, fluttering in the toil like the simple tranced bird, which hovers over the basilisk serpent, as bound by strings of iron to its destroyer—even so the younger traveller, lay with ear painfully acute to the stirring of the slightest breath within the wigwam, while often such was the intense anxiety of his mind, that cold beads of dew hung on his forehead, starting as if they were drops of blood gathered from his veins;—with what a bursting vision, must the defenceless victim, bound in the embrace of the brazen and crowned idol of those accursed vallies, Tophet[47] [47] Some imagine Tophet to have been the butchery, or place of slaughter, at Jerusalem, lying to the south of the city, in the valley of the children of Hinnom, and where, it is also said, that a constant fire was kept for burning the carcasses and other filth, that was brought out of the city; there it was also, they cast the ashes and remains of their false gods, when they demolished their altars and broke down their statues; others say it was where they offered to the god Moloch with beat of drum; the statue of Moloch was brass, hollow within, with its arms extended, and stooping a little forward: they lighted a great fire within the statue, and another before it; they put the person intended to be sacrificed upon one of its arms, which soon fell down into the fire at the foot of the statue, while the victim's shrieks and cries were drowned by the rattling of drums, and the sound of other musical instruments. and Hinnom, have drank in the horrid preparations of the bloody priests and sacrificers—the tumultuous cries about him—the shrieks of the mad worshippers—the riotous sounding of tymbal, sackbut, or psaltery, could not for a second have withdrawn his fixed attention, or aroused him from the misery of his situation; and so, though the younger traveller dropped his heavy lids o'er their blood-shot balls, to give them an instant's ease, and to collect his energy for the emergence which he deemed was nigh—yet it struck him as if in that short time, every machination which was to be dreaded, had been compassed—and immediately he turned the disturbed orbs with quick strained sense upon those he had so briefly closed them on; his sight came unware upon a near, and that which had awhile been an unnoted object; his glance met in its wild sweep an answer—but not of sympathy, as it seemed to him, but adding to alarm—for, seated idly a few paces distant from his rude mat, was the attendant boy, with looks bent intently on the agitated traveller, with an anxious and apparent watching: as soon as he caught the gaze that observed him, and which was nearly simultaneous to both, the expression of his eye sunk to glassiness and vacancy—the former meaning, however, that had disturbed the features of this stripling, from their common idiot and stolid character, had not been unmarked by the traveller—but it was so much like the hate and anger-swelled countenance of vexed childhood, that the busy mind dwelt not on it—yet now it was repeated, and in such a shape and manner, as could leave no doubt but this fragile and feeble creature, was soon about to take a share in some determined act against him, and to which he looked as one gloating on expected revenge. “Can nature, in so young and tender a plant, have sowed feelings so fiendlike?” whispered the traveller to himself, “good God! what could I have done to this springald? my memory serves—I recollect him not—and yet, though treated so brutally by these men, he seems as if he would vent the gall of his soul on me—a stranger to him, who hath never crossed him in life—still, would he were all I had to fear—howbeit, he looks as very an imp of mischief and blood, as ever Satan sent earthward to plague and curse mankind.” But the traveller, in this last sentence, had done the youth injustice: his garments, as has been mentioned, were of the poorest kind, but there was a nobleness and singular beauty in his person, that ill accorded with his wretched attire: nevertheless, his mantle, with its tattered drapery, was wrapped so close about him, that the delicacy of his form and features was greatly concealed, except from the most prying search—and whether assumed or not, yet there was in general, that absent and unattending air about him, which well bespoke his mental incapacity, and his want, as the hosts had heretofore informed, of the powers of speech and hearing— he sat partly in the light, and partly in the shadow, and as the traveller pursued the chain of his thought with his eye on him, he could not but acknowledge a surprise, that he had passed this creature so cursorily, and but now been stricken in observing him—the complexion of the youth wore apparently a dusky tinge, but clear as the sweet scented olibanum,[48] [48] A sweet scented gum or resin, that naturally distils out of several trees at the foot of Mount Libanus, in white and yellow drops. It is sometimes called the male incense. yet where the cloak had fallen from his neck, his skin denied that as its native hue, for in those places, it was transparent and white as an infant's, while his long black hair, of womanish loveliness, hung floating careless and dishevelled, around his head—his face was pale and wan, and his features, though regular, were thin and emaciated by want and suffering; there he sat, every limb motionless, stirring not from the spot where he had placed himself, which now was lit by the quick and bickering flame of the distant fire; and anon as it died, left almost in dusky night, while he seemed so fading and shadowy, that the straying fancy might have dressed him out as some spectre in a vision, or a lost spirit sitting penitent at the gate of Gehenna and weeping for its departed glory. And could it have so chanced, was the traveller in his mistrust at error, had his active mind, eager in rendering him torment, conjured an omen in the stripling's glance, that had never been? could he have been so deceived as thus to imagine harm where there was none? Yes, it was plain. The broken spirited urchin was too much taken up with his own grief, to injure others—for as the observer continued to look upon him, he perceived his bosom rise and swell as if the heart it covered was bursting beneath; and with slender fingers he swept away hastily the cloud of tears that had sprung like rain drops on his long eye-lashes.—in truth the unfortunate child might well have expressed that image of patient sorrow, who with “Her meek hands folded on her modest breast, With calm submission lifts the adoring eye Even to the storm that wrecks her.” The traveller felt his heart yearn in pity to the parentless, abandoned creature; but his was not a condition to extend assistance, and with a bitter pang he found that he was selfish in his despair: restless and agitated, he turned on his rough mat, and strived to shut out the misery he beheld in the sharp remindings of the desperate circumstances in which he believed himself placed; but that mild, tearful eye, and saddened countenance, was still before him—he could not combat against them; they seemed to beseech help, but how could he extend it? they were as the dying cries of the perishing follower of an Arabian caravan, that seeketh but a drop of water from his comrade, to moisten his burning lip and tongue, when he who is besought, hath but an empty cruise, and reels himself with death and perishing thirst. And now, as if some demon revelled in the torture inflicted on him, and urged the barbed arrows, unsated with the anguish he had already endured, came new food for doubt and alarm: the guide, to whose obstinacy and ignorance all was owing, had disappeared; when and whither, he knew not: fruitless were the efforts he made to recollect the Dutchman's departure; an indistinct remembrance of his having been a short time in the wigwam, alone remained; the rest was uncertainty and doubt; a hundred unpleasant ideas, crowded at once upon him—all was confirmed—they had been betrayed; the road had been wandered from designedly, and if aught had yet been wanted, it was but this, and to see the hanger bared and pointed at the victim's breast. Of the group near the fire, all except three abandoning their debauch had drawn their huge cloaks about them and stretched their limbs upon their mats, as composed for sleep—and those on watch, sat basking their brawny bodies before the blaze, feeding the flames at times with fresh fuel, and discoursing together in a low and stifled tone of voice, of which now and then a half muttered sound, louder than the rest, would reach the eager and expectant ear of the listening traveller; but from these, he was scarce enabled to gather much, though he held his breath with intense attention, and though when the light of the fire round which they had closed, and which now scarcely pierced the sable precincts of the darkening hovel, cast a vivid and reddening glare upon the deep and earnest brows of the discoursers, he strove to read the very motions of their lips, and workings of their muscles, but it was in vain; a faint noise was all he could distinguish, like the busy fluttering of the wings of some teasing insect; yet it struck him that at times, when the mounting blaze battled through the sullen smoke, and played strongly on the bluff and hardened visages of the speakers, that he detected glances fearful and ferocious, that were cast towards the place where he lay, betokening impatience and disappointment: however, after a short while, two of these men seemed to follow the example of their companions; for breaking off their conversation, they crouched themselves on the earth as if to seek rest; while he who was left, though contending against his weariness, stalked about the fire as on watch and in tendence lest it might expire from neglect, looking as he walked upon his round with stealthy pace, like some midnight plunderer guarding his booty; but this he soon abandoned and sitting down he bent over the blaze and spread his huge and sinewy hands to the heat, delighting in the grateful warmth; then slowly his eye lost its habitual fierceness—first his head wavered like the furze on the mountain steep, and now he would start suddenly awake, and gaze around, yet it was not long ere it dropped on his broad shoulder and he yielded to the slumber, whose tyrant approach appeared to conquer all his exertions. Time gradually moved forward in the night. From out the smouldering and burning heap that formed the body of the fire would tower a tall and wavering pillar of flame, which as sudden as it rose would sink down, flooded as it were by a vast and floating cloud of stifling smoke that almost threatened its extinction, even like the black mist of time that enshadows the glory of the great dead, or like the dark mantle of envy that enshrouds and hides the glowing flight of genius; as the fire's strength grew fainter and fainter, at intervals it would flash up with a fitful irradiation that lit the whole place, and rendered the sleeping and cloaked forms around visible, stretched out like the bodies of the slain upon the battle field, near the night fires of the warriors that had triumphed; and now the blaze would fall, changing the colour of every sportive flash to as many dies as streak the skin of the dying dolphin. As it burnt low and expiring, a small blue flame would dart like a barbed spear on the tops of the coals and embers, many of which still looked bright with life and ignition, though the others wore a dye blacker than the curled locks of the Numidian, whose darkness was slowly creeping on the whole bed, with an approach as sure as death steals on the body. Still ever and anon, some wandering breath of wind, like a small streamlet sporting from the parent flood, leaving the rude shrill blast that it had made a part, and which whistled fierce and angrily around the hut, stole through some unguarded aperture of wall, and swept o'er the fading warmth, making for a moment, the lively red run through the blackened stumps, like blood revisiting the veins of the heart; but these would rejoice and sparkle but an instant, for as the air fell the heat retired again, leaving an ashy whiteness on the logs like the shroud of a corpse. As the cause for vigilance seemingly declined, a sort of stupor began involuntarily to weigh upon the senses of the traveller. Gleam after gleam as it started or perished he marked, and counted minute after minute as they departed down the stream of time; he listened to the howl of the wild animals without, which by times would echo from the distance, and then were answered so close to the sides of the wigwam, as to arouse the large dogs from their dozings at their master's feet, and force them to point their eager ears, and utter in defiance a short deep note of hate, ere they again sank their heads between their outstretched paws; he heard the moan of the never tiring breeze, and the grief-like and hollow voice of the forest, as it bent beneath the violent attacks of the half renewed storm;—and soon his thoughts grew uncontrolled, and wandered from the objects to which he strived to direct them, like the scattered fragments of a wreck borne from their owner's grasp by the gamboling waves; by degrees the gloomy figures and objects around faded and fluctuated before his dim eyes, until the sight Vol. I. 21 could neither rest on them nor descry their forms or shapes: and yet he neither slept or waked, but lay like one under the influence of a dream in the delirious dozes of a fever, in which the wild wanderings of the disturbed mind takes the fantasies that its own workings conjures up, as the real actions and passings of life; and still, withal, he thought not but that he was watching warily and intent; for often he tossed and threw his heated and feverish limbs from side to side on his hard couch, as he deemed the forgetfulness of slumber preyed on his brain, while a nearly indistinct moan would burst unconsciously from his trembling lips—for it seemed unto him that broken and disturbing murmurs rang in his ears, and at intervals there rushed before and about him, multitudinous figures, and distorted and frowning masses of beings; and there passed fearful events and actions around, with the swift and rapid course of a winged whirlwind. In vain his vision strained at first to distinguish and mark the crowd, or one single shape; all impressed him as familiar, yet his exertion to retain the memory an instant longer than their presence, was powerless; they were a strange, mingled and ghastly spectacle, that swam quickly away like the waves of a stormy ocean, crossing, bursting and contending with each other, and taking a thousand varied forms, that is beyond the mariner to remember: yet at one time, amid this trooping of unearthly phantoms, his vision met a human face, but it was pallid and wan—its eyes lustreless and fixed, as those in the sockets of a strangled man: and when it had caught his sight, it stirred not, but stood without motion, with its dull and lifeless gaze rivetted on him; while he seemed bound to it as fascinated by some spell, against whose influence he was unable to resist, though his heart panted and knocked at his ribs, and his brain felt as bursting: anon the spectre came nearer to him, and he felt a cold and icy grasp, that thrilled through every nerve, and the damp and clammy perspiration sprang from every pore at the death-like touch,—sore he strove to fly, and struggled in agony, as one battles for life: but his antagonist grappled him with the strength of a giant; vain he strained; he was as a stripling in the gripe of a grown man: and then he deemed he was dragged along, in spite of his convulsive efforts, with a velocity like the wind drives an atom; his head grew giddy, and his sense whirled in faintness;—at last they appeared to reach the steep brink of a dark precipice, adown whose gloomy side his enemy strove to thrust him,—below, was black and gloomy as a den; the depth was pierceless, fathomless; and now it seemed as if his limbs sank beneath him, and he was struck still and strengthless, in the hands of his merciless foe; his very voice was thralled, and his cries were choked in his throat, while his parched tongue clove dry as dust to his mouth; then a weight like lead was heaped upon his breast; it pressed heavier and heavier; the ribs creaked, scarce able to support the burthen; his veins started, and a cold shivering ran through his blood; when, as if loosed by the invisible hand of a sorcerer, he was disenthralled; freed from the terrible force that lay upon him; but as he fled, a hundred months appeared shrieking and shouting around him; onward and onward he went, through mist and night, but the steps of pursuit were behind, while his ear throbbed at the sound, as though pierced with the sharpest steel; closer and closer they came; he felt the very wind pass him, from the floating of their garments; he shuddered with terror; again he thought that grave-cold hand was on him; he sank as he felt its icy gripe, as withered by a stroke of palsy; a broken shriek of pain and horror rose on his lips, as he heard the triumphant howl of his persecutor; with desperate and frenzied force, he struggled and—awoke. But yet so lively was the impression made on his heated imagination, by the wild and thronging phantasies of his fevered vision, that it was sometime ere he could drive away the shapes—the gliding and gibbering phantoms that had disturbed him in dream— nor was he able to hinder his distress of mind, giving itself vent and relief by a deep and desparing sigh. “Merciful heaven,” he ejaculated unconsciously, half aloud, though in that whispering tone of voice that assimilated to his agitated chain of thought, “the very bitterness of death, exceeds not this.” “There are those who watch for thy safety at hand,” said a voice in answer close to his side—the words, though they were tremulous and low, as if the lip that uttered them, had quivered in doubt or fearful haste, yet sounded distinct, sweet and clear, as the music of a viol. The traveller started with involuntaty surprise—the the strange and stirring fancies of his sleep, seemed scarcely dissipated. “Good God! what are you?—how—where?” exclaimed he rapidly, and eagerly glancing his eyes around in the darkness. He could see nothing, and no answer was returned— he repeated his words, and sought his question louder. “Who do you want? what the devil are you?” returned a hoarse and surly voice—“why the devil do you set off your pederero at this rate? an you rest not yourself, break not that of others.” The incident had now completely aroused the traveller; he deemed an explanation with the last speaker would afford no satisfaction, for even yet he felt uncertain whether the voice had not been a mere delusion of his thoughts, half sleeping and awakening, embodied in an answer, that had impressed not the ear, though the mind had so fancied; he therefore remained silent, and in a few moments heard the person who had just addressed him, renew his inquiry with an oath, at having been disturbed without reason— then again all was still and hushed, unbroken by a sound, except the deep and hard breathings of the sleepers around. The fire had by this time sank to a few, half-lighted and nearly dying brands, that sent out neither heat nor warmth, and the traveller shivered as he felt the chillness of the night, and the cold of the season strike his blood; he drew his mantle closer to his body, and lay with his limbs huddled on his mat. Suddenly, there was a slight movement near him, as of the gliding step of one stealing with cautious pace, as fearful of being discovered, and almost at the same time, the voice he had before been startled by, came to his ear with a note as melodious and as soft as the silvery song of beauty in her midnight bower. “For your life's sake, be still—speak not,” said the voice hurriedly, “your rashness will endanger others, and you are lost for ever: stir not, notice not whatever come that may alarm—you are in bad hands, yet trust in heaven—” there was a hasty noise as of a guarded and suppressed converse in a farther part of the wigwam—the voice pursued, as if quickened at being overheard, and at the same time, making the communication so low as to render it impossible for any listening, to distinguish a syllable, “time wears fast—can you, will you place confidence in a stranger—you must, you've no other chance, and I swear—but what avails an oath; you have those things with you that will cost your heart's blood; give them me, they shall be safe—it will preserve you.” The total darkness around, though he must have even stooped above him, rendered the traveller unable to see his mysterious visiter, and the rapidity with which he was now spoken to, gave him scarce time to reflect, and his first impulse was to draw partly from his bosom the packet that was demanded; but as he felt a cold, eager, trembling hand touch his lightly to receive the treasure, an indecisive feeling came on him.” “I dare not—who are you?” said he, “that knoweth my business so well, and seeks so singular a favour from me: What pledge of your faith have I?—No! no! my life, if it be sought, shall end with my duty.” “Rash man, you know not what you do,” returned the voice in a yet quicker and hurried accent, “for God's sake, delay not thus. If I mean you not fair, may I drop a corse the instant—hush, I hear them—they come; they are here.” As the voice finished the last broken sentence, the traveller became conscious, that with an action sudden as unexpected, the hand of the speaker had glided under his arm, and bewildered as he was by the boldness of the attempt, as by all that had passed, ere he could guard against it, or even seize the intruder, the entrusted documents, 21* the charge on which so much depended, were gone; snatched from him in a moment. With a terrific cry of rage, he would have sprung after the nocturnal demon who had robbed him, but as he strove to rise, a powerful grasp withheld him, and bore him backwards to the earth. “Vile assassin! loosen thy hold, or bitterly shalt thou rue the hour,” cried the traveller, as with desperate force he endeavoured to free himself from his antagonist, and to draw his weapon from his side. “Nuestra senora, an you swing your martinets thus, damn thee, I shall cut your painter,” said the adversary, pressing his knee on the bosom of the prostrate soldier. “Base dog! dost thou intend to murther me? Stoll, comrade—help! help!” “Carra, man, thy mate will have enow to do to fight his own ship.” “Alas! Hal, I hear thy call,” said the voice of the en sign, dolefully, “but I am bound, and my body lays as dead as ever did the mullar of Poussin.” “Ho, Lumby, Jenkins, Lofe,” shouted the pirate impatiently, “hang out the glim; curse ye, lazy lubbers, it is as dark as a squall of Cape Hatteras. Congo, you black serpent, why you are as slow as thof you'd never handled a rope, and this fellow flounders like a fresh caught shark.” After a few vain and exhausting efforts of resistance, the limbs of the traveller were secured, and he became motionless in the power of the desperadoes; the faint rays of a lighted lanthorn, upheld in the hand of one of the ruffians, now pierced the gloom of the hovel. “Mass, senor caballero, but it is no small job to hold off thy capstern, whelps,” said the conqueror, “carra, thy hawse is crossed this side of the windlass, for damn ye! d'ye see, we are lads con todo el mondo guerra, as Don Anthonio, our linguister, says, and it must be a quick helmsman that steers clear of the grapnel of the brethren of the coast.” “Oho, mate, change thy mizen,” interposed a ruffian, savagely placing his hand on the prisoner, “blast it, the tide waits for no man; so let's overhaul the prize.” Aye, lads,” added another, “what's their cargo? clear away the rigging, and let's have a sight of all under hatches.” “Move thy hulk aside,” echoed a third, “why damn it, thou art like a head sea—let me rip the canvass.” “Give sea room—what has he aboard? give sea room,” vociferated others, as they crowded about the captives. “In a few minutes, the garments of the travellers were rifled of every valuable, and rent and cut to pieces, by the brutal hands and keen tucks of the freebooters, as they eagerly contended for the spoil. “Avast, messmates,” said the commander, interposing, “this is no time to slacken your braces—each lad shall have his fair share of the booty, but now there's no time for it; so look close to what papers the dogs bear; for an I am not on a wrong coast, we have ta'en to-night that which is worth the bravest flota.” “Now by my halidome!” said Jost Stoll imploringly, “kind masters, ye know not what ye do; touch not my fuelle with such irreverent hands—good heavens— you will deface my best copy of Vandyke—be satisfied— you have my gold, cavaliers—be not worse than Goths— than Vandals, I implore ye—take my life, but harm not that sketch—it is from the bull of Paul Poter—and Sir Godfrey Kneller said at the last meeting of the KitKat club, that—now by Saint Paul—see, you are crushing that cartoon to pieces—and there's my study from Gerard Dow, under your foot—my Julio Romano—masters, that is my most precious work—if ye have any pity, any mercy, kill me—rend me in atoms, but—have ye no eyes—no taste? I shall go mad.” “Fools, what have ye here?” exclaimed the rover, as with a quick and careless hand, disregarding the intercessions and anguish of the agitated ensign, he ran over the papers that contained the drawings so sacred to the amateur, and which, after a moment's examination, were cast to the earth in contempt, “these are not what I seek—are there none other? art sure? none other—by—, the vile and crafty knave hath suspected me, and destroyed them—speak out—where is thy trust?” continued he gazing furiously in the face of the younger traveller, who moved not beneath his eye, but kept a sullen silence—“where hast thou hid the papers with which thou wast charged? dost hear me? hadst thou nothing for Van Courtlandt's friends—for the younger Bayard faction—for Schuyler? wilt not answer? do you know who you brave? may my soul be damned, an I rip not the secret from thy heart.” “Thou hast already done thy worst, base outlaw,” at length returned the traveller composedly, and with a calm and determined utterance, “why then mock me with inquiries thou knowest are as bootless, as if thou sought an answer from the rocks? I have fallen by thy stratagem; I know my life is forfeit, and I have no wish to live: therefore trouble me no more, but end my miseries with your hungry knives.” “Obstinate, rash idot,” cried the buccaneer, apparently goaded by the firmness of his prisoner, beyond the controlling of his raging passions, “dost brave me— by hell! young man, thou hadst better rouse the wild devil, than waken my anger; sooth, boy, thou may'st not deem thou art in danger—hast heard of Kid—Richard Kid— him whom they call savage—murderer—pirate,—bold wight, he is before you:—come, tempt me not to drive my hanger through thy body—but give forth the papers I have sought of thee—it may save the shedding of blood:” he paused in expectation of an answer, but none was returned—for an instant he appeared as endeavouring to smother the rising choler which almost choaked him; his limbs trembled like a child's, or as if stricken with an ague fit; then no longer able to bound the tiger fury which swelled him, he burst forth with a voice hoarse as the first tremendous rush of the travado, when it leaps from the mountain to the ocean—“spawn of hell,” he cried, “wilt keep thy damned silence? thou art bold—a very bold man: now hearken, thou wilt not wag that tongue o' thine one jot—ha! by — may I be a dead man this hour, if I have it not torn out by the roots; it shall not serve thee for one word again; thou knowest not what I can do; of all, thou dream'st not, what I will have done to thee; thou shalt die piecemeal; what ho! my hounds there—ye shall have food; your tusks shall peel a banquet from this fellow's carcass.” As he spoke, he gave an encouraging signal, which was answered by the dogs, who with savage bounds sprang from the earth, towards their victim, growling, and showing through the snowy foam that hung upon their lips, their white huge and sharp teeth, and their eyes kindling to balls of fire: the rover's followers stood in a gloomy crowd, advancing their fierce visages to view the scene—while a horrid gratification seemed dwelling on their hardened features. “On him, knaves,” shouted the marauder, “an ye leave one gout of flesh to moisten his bones, by — I'll have you beaten that ye have done your duty so ill.” With a ferocious howl, the dogs flew on the captive— who, defenceless and bound, vainly struggled to free a limb, to oppose the blood seeking animals—he strained and tugged, until the veins of his arms swelled thick as cords upon the skin—his heart throbbed quickly against his side—the blood coursed in floods of fire through every part of his body—yet had he been as still and stirless as a corse stark for the burial, he had not been more powerless—with the strength of despair, he bit at the bonds that held him—but his vain endeavours to free himself, merely excited bursts of unpitying laughter from the merciless tormentors, who gazed upon his agonies with that brutal indifference of the pain inflicted, and with that exultation of enjoyment of the sport, with which the matador eyes the dying gasps of the conquered bull. The fangs of one of the dogs were fastened in his side, the other, hanging to his shoulder as to the flank of a flying hind, darted at his throat; wildly, madly did he strive to cast him from his hold, but the well trained beast kept snapping at that which instinct seemed to guide him, as the fatal spot from which he could destroy life. The baited victim felt the animal's teeth compress and pierce the collar that was wound around his neck, as though it was the edge of some deadly instrument that cut it through; their sharp points seemed to touch his skin like the ends of needles, and his very marrow thrilled within him; a moment the stiff ruff was his defence— then it parted, severed, and the bare tusks entered his flesh, which appeared to peel away before their iron power like shrivelled parchment, and the blood trickled warm as fire adown his bosom, and dyed the jaws of the ferocious brute;—his sense wavered, his brain seemed bursting in agony, the balls of his eyes distended, and all around was vivid as day:—the flash of the beast's eyes met his, they looked like flakes of living flame—the force of a giant gathered in him—the cords that tightened round his wrist broke in twain—an instant and his fingers tore open the gullet of the animal who had seized him so dangerously—he pursued his conquest—the bite of the dog relaxed—he hung fainter—he dropped—staggered —sunk his head and died, uttering a savage moan with his last breath. The whole action was but an instant, for almost ere the companion fell, the other dog had sprang on the arm that had o'erthrown him, and was fast urging the revenge for his death, while his antagonist, enteebled even by his victory, shook as one dying; for now a film of darkness came upon him, and he seemed stricken as by a blow of lightning unto ashes; he strove against it, but the blood rushed to his head; beads of cold dew streamed on his brows, until they ran like dust into his sight; his ears were filled as by the gurgling of waters—nature could not bear his agonies—he reeled,—he could see—he could hear no more, but dropped down on the bloody carcass of his dead foe, and lay in the welling flood of gore, like a thing without motion, feeling, or life. How long he remained thus insensible he recked not, but it was not long; though it was a void dismal, chill, and vacant—an unbroken dreamless sleep; yet soon his scattered faculties began to return, and gather might and distinctness, like a defeated army when rallied after the rout and the pursuit; at first he strove to rise, but found his limbs yet firmly chained by his bonds, and in the vain effort the thongs almost cut him to the bone, with the quickness of tempered steel: a hundred pains shot through every nerve, violent shiverings shook his limbs;—then he moved his hand to his heart; his clothes were rent in the struggle, and his fingers stuck to the bare flesh; he drew them away, for they were covered with clotted blood that poured down from his wounds, which were now numbed, deadened; he gazed wildly about him; the swarthy and unrelenting countenance of the buccaneer met his look; there he stood holding back the hound, that had been called off from the prey, and whose eagerness was yet untamed, so that he could scarce be restrained from again leaping on the traveller—for the instant he saw him stir, he started as though he would have rushed on him and sated his hate. The fainting captive closed his eyes; a sensation at once sickly and blasting came over him—he felt like some prisoner respited at the death hour, but for a day; brought back when the bitterness of death was past, again to have his miseries renewed, again to gaze with anxious thought beyond the darksome gate; again to feel minute after minute glide away towards that fearful hour of inevitable fate; again to count drop after drop, as the sand ran through the prison hour of glass; while his every prayer for life was mocked by his persecutors, who rejoiced in his despair like the cruel urchin who triumphs in the convulsive contortions of a tortured worm, whose pains and distress he increases by repeated wounds, till the last spark of existence fleets away, and is then hardly glutted with its miserable death,—a groan burst from the lips of the traveller in the very bitterness of his anguish. “How say you now, master?” said Kid, “am I not one who keepeth the words of threat I give? troth, thou art of right stuff, as is thy comrade, you jolly knave; but this is no place or hour to spin long yarns—so which of ye have taken wit in your counsel and will satisfy on that which I have sought?” “By the memory of Leonardi De Vinci,” muttered Jost Stoll, doggedly, “though you make dog's meat of me, you'll find me as dumb as a pannel ere it is touched by the brush; ay, on my halidome, what have I to live for? look at my sketches, my studies, originals and copies, all torn, stained, trod under foot—oh, you barbarians, had I but the use of my rapier. I'd make a composition among you equal to Holbein's dance of death.” “What! and is it these daubs, these crankums, that it would take a conjuror to make head or tail of, that you make this storm about?” said the free trader, “why curse it, man, they are not worth thy care; they are not baubles that would amuse a child—cheer up and bear a hand— come, my boy, we'll have faith between us; chuck this nonsense overboard, and venture with me, I'll glut you with golden pictures; thof an you like, there's many an altar piece that would bring ducats with the rich at home, that we'll not grudge you ship room, after sacking a church or rifling a convent.” The ensign's attention appeared alone to be aroused by the first words of the buccaneer's address to him— “What mean you?” replied he, angrily, “'sdeath, daubs! now by the soul of Rembrandt, I have never been so insulted—daubs! hark you, Sir, do you know what sketching is? did you ever see the studies of Raphael D'Urbino? of Michael Angelo? of Titian? of the Caracci? daubs! death and the devil! just (I am tied, and can't) pick up that outline of a landscape that lies by my foot, I'll show you perspective, keeping, composition, grouping, foliage:—damn it, it is easy to see you have no more taste than an owl. What would you say to Sir Godfrey's first study of his Bacchante? daub! daub! ha?” “I tell thee what master,” returned the other,” thy comrade here keeps his stays too taught, and thy jaws are too slack, for thy brain is as cracked as ever was the chink of a rotten wreck; so d'ye hear? I'll have no more of your wild palaver; but damn you, you porpoise-faced swab, an thou and thy mate here do not see fit to answer me in one half hour, you shall both be beaten to death with the flats of our cutlasses—I swear it; you have but that short while to reckon accounts with this world; so curse ye, mulish dogs, make the best of it. Come boys,” continued he, addressing his companions, “you have not turned in long to-night, and we have two glasses yet, ere morning, or ere we can see the way to our lugger, so you that stand in need, take out your mats—stay Eumet, it is your watch; you will find Luath beyond the threshhold— keep a look out ahead, there may be ferret-hawkers aboard—there is no fear of these knaves getting loose or disturbing our sleep, but at all events, at times, give an eye. At the first peep of dawn arouse me, and by God, an they then speak not to the better purpose, their mouths shall be sewn up for ever.” So saying, the reckless freebooter enfolded himself in his wide mantillo, and threw himself on the ground; his ruffian attendants, with the exception of Eumet, who left the interior of the wigwam as he was ordered, followed the example of their leader, and in a short time all was again hushed and still as the grave within the so late busy and stirring hovel. The traveller attempted not to arise from the cold earth whereon he had sank, lost and despairing: indeed so hard and strongly had his bonds now been drawn and secured around his limbs, that an endeavour was uselessly exhausting their weakened and waning power—and as he felt the moments pass, conscious that each that flitted to the shades, drew him nearer to the close that awaited him—his death hour, the very desire of existence, appeared as departing; and fast he gave way to a hopeless lethargy, which seemed to tighten with cords of iron about his brain; his lacerated neck, his torn side, were painless—the blood had ceased to flow, though the black and curdled gouts hung stiff and dry to his broken garments. A few paces from him, unremoved by his careless masters, lay the carcass of the slain hound—his half opened eyes still retained a glassy lustre, and his teeth were firmly set against each other; large dashes of gore were on him, and his contracted limbs showed what dreadful struggles had preceded death: sick, wearied and fainting, the traveller closed his eyes, and in the depth of his anguish, he wished for the death that now was lingering—and he lay as if the stroke had already fallen; but he remained not so long, for soon he was conscious of a cooling feeling that came o'er his burning and aching Vol. I. 22 brow, as if his beating temples were bathed by some pleasant liquid, and like in the pauses of some dream, he distinguished a gentle voice that strove to impart comfort, as though some benignant and ministering being, like a guardian spirit of pity and succour, that wings around the tiresome couch of sickness, hovered about him; he looked, and beheld the pirate's boy. “Awake,” whispered he in a tone low and fearful, “your bonds are cut—your comrade is at my side—be quick, and follow silently—for should they stir, we're lost.” He started from the ground mechanically, at the bidding of the youth, and stood a moment breathless; a mist swam before him, and with a faint sigh, he would have again fallen to the earth, had it not been for the supporting arm of the ensign. “This way, this way,” said the boy hurriedly, and gazing wild and trembling about him as he spoke, “your lives depend on your caution—follow me.” “By my halidome! brave youth,” exclaimed the ensign, but I— “For God's sake, question me not now—but swift— follow,” said the boy, “tread light, lest you arouse them.” And like a spectre flitting among church-yard tombs, he glided over the prostrate bodies of the sleepers: by the flickering light of the lanthorn, which still burned from the centre of the hut feebly and irregularly, they pursued their guide with a step so soft, that not an echo was heard from it: as they stole along, the sleeping Kid lay before them; they started, for his eyes were wide open and looking towards them; and his lips moved as to stay their flight—“Fear not,” said their preserver, “he sleeps soundly.” As the boy spoke, he stooped above the buccaneer, and dexterously undid the long dark sea cloak which wrapt his brawny limbs, and gently drawing it from his body, he turned back and threw it over the shoulders of the younger traveller—who pressed in silent gratitude, the hand of the noble youth. “By my halidome,” exclaimed Jost Stoll, “that dog's head were worth carrying away—Warren would give the weight in gold to have it[49] [49] Commodore Warren, commander of the squadron sent to cruise in search of Kid, off the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Comorin, and Colonel Bass, Governor of East Jersey, offered large reward for his apprehension; an amnesty being extended to all the other free traders who would come in, excepting Kid and Every —and by Saint Paul, it would make an exquisite sketch—hist, yonker—do you think there is time for me to take the outlines? I wont be a minute—” Are you mad,” said the boy, “see you not he stirs? heaven have mercy! I fear me Loffe has wakened—this way, for your lives sake—for mine, if you care not for your own—follow me in silence.” With a quick and noiseless pace, hardly daring to look behind them, lest they should behold the dark visages of the buccaneers peering over their shoulders, or feel their deadly and iron grasps, they proceeded on and gained the door of the wigwam unmolested; its covering of deer hide was uplifted, and the sweet and free breath of the heavens blew in upon them, bearing, with its refreshening touch, renewed vigour to their doubting hearts. “By the fame of Lanfranco,” exclaimed Jost Stoll, looking back in the hovel, “an my eyes deceive me not, yonder by that snoring slave, lays my head from Tintoretto; it seems but little injured: an I die for it, I will not lose it; troth, to abandon so fine a specimen, were an insult to the arts.” “What are you about?” exclaimed his comrade, withholding him as he motioned to return, “surely you will not so rashly run on danger, and risk instant death to all, and for such a bauble?” “Bauble!” replied the ensign, struggling to break from him, “a drawing like that a bauble—such sweetness of shadow, flowing of lines, mellowness of finish, for it is coloured the very counterpart of the original, which brought five hundred louis at the auction of the famous collection of the Duc de Montmorenci, and is now one of the chef d'œuvres in the gallery of the Luxemburgh—bauble! why man, you know no more of the arts than a half bred spaniel. You should hear what Sir Godfrey Kneller said—” “For mercy, ensign, hold a moment; hear me—think where you are—think—” “Think, and such a picture at stake? by my halidome, there is not time to think.” “On! on! we shall be lost,” cried the youth, impapatiently urging forward the younger traveller. “I must not, will not, leave this incautious man behind. See, boy, he quits us though I—” “Then let the dotard idiot perish in his obstinacy; there are more lives at hazard than his,” as the stripling spoke, with a hasty and firm grasp, he seized the arm of the irresolute traveller, and with a strength beyond his childish appearance, but which was mustered by a sudden desperation and determined action, he drew him onwards, and ere he had a thought to oppose, they were without the wigwam, and the hide was dropped athwart the doorway: but their escape was not yet effected. “There is a friend who should have watched here; but I see him not,” anxiously whispered the boy as he paused and gazed around: “what could have happened? he cannot be false—yet I fear me all is not right.” Upon the broad visage of the heavens but slight vestige of the late fearful tempest remained; here and there alone, a few small, broken and fleecy clouds of rack, like gay flocks of white-winged birds, swept in scattered bodies on the blue horizon, at times obscuring the lordly moon, who was hastening to her wane, with a misty veil; yet beneath the light of the fair orb, all was a wide and blighted waste: the clear snow, ghastly as the cheek of death, lay all around; wreaths of it dangled like garlands on every tree and bush, and hung on the low and ruinous gables of the hovel, which could scarcely be discerned from the deep and heavy drifts which had been piled against it by the wind. A small cloud floated before the moon; the fugitives waited with breathless impatience till it had passed on its course, and the full radiance glittered on the sparkling snow. “Great God! I do not see him; he has deserted us— what will become of us?” cried the youth in a tone of piercing despair, and wringing his hands in fear. A slight quick sound, like the foot of a living creature, pressing in the fresh snow and beating gently the ground, met the anxious ear of the traveller. “Hark!” softly whispered he to his companion, “I hear some one; he whom you look for—” “Oh no! no!” cried the youth bitterly, “undone! undone!” At this moment, the hound that had accompanied the huntsman who had discovered the travellers, in the former section, came leaping from around an angle of the hut. When he beheld the fugitives, he stopped short, and drawing himself back on his hind legs, he raised his long ears, and uttered a hoarse, deep growl; the stripling seemed sinking to the earth in terror; but at once mustering his self-possession, he advanced boldly towards the animal, who, as he drew near, apparently laid aside his ferocity, and when he had recognised the youth, bounded joyfully about him. “What cheer, springal, ha? who have you there?” said a fierce voice, and the hunter stood before them. The boy, with a wonderful command of feeling, at the very instant he beheld the man, composed his countenance and resumed the idiot gaze of listlessness, which he had worn within the wigwam when in attendance on the ruffians; slowly appearing to gather the meaning of the question, from the action that accompanied it, he made a hasty sign, pointing towards the hovel and the traveller and then to the forest, as if to intimate they were despatched on an errand by those within; and lastly, he made a sign as if to enforce that the matter was secret and emergent. The traveller drew the pirate's cloak close about him. The hunter hesitated. “This is a strange business— who is with you,” said he, motioning the question as he spoke. The youth signed again in return. “What, Eumet,” 22* said the hunter; “by God! this is not so; one might as soon snare a leveret out of season, as to keep him silent from an outlandish proverb; this is not him; and—Ha!” As he spoke, a loud and terrific shout, that rung like a death knell, was heard from within the wigwam “By hell! I was not out of the scent,” cried the hunter, as he levelled his musquetoon at the traveller; “yield thy life.” But ere his hand touched the lock of the piece, the boy sprang upon his arm, and held it down in spite of his efforts to free himself. At the same time the traveller, darted forward, and ere he could shake off the hold that the youth had seized with the energy of desperation, the hunter was fiercely grappled with, and was cast to the earth, more by the quickness of the attack than the strength of his adversaries; the musquetoon was wrenched from his hand. “Villain!” cried the traveller, as he pointed the weapon, “take thy rich deserts.” A loud and heart-rending shriek from the youth broke on the attention of the traveller ere he could discharge the gun. “Save me, oh save me!” cried the boy. The dog, attracted by the scuffle and the imminent stress of his master, had with a loud bark flown at the throat of the youth, as if he would have torn him to pieces in the rescue. The traveller stepped back and instantly fired; the beast, with a long, hollow, and revengeful howl fell weltering in his blood—while at nearly the like instant something passed by the traveller, cutting the air with a sharp hissing noise. The traveller turned hastily round, and beheld the hunter reel back, while his brains and gore gushed out in every direction; the tomahawk of the Indian was buried in the skull of the ruffian. The whole struggle from the alarm to the hunter's death, scarce occupied the time taken in the relation. “Brother,” said the savage, “thy feet must be like the wild cat, thy foemen are behind.” He seized the traveller by the hand, and plunged forward towards a small thicket of underwood, followed by the boy; dashing loads of snow on every side as they ran. Scarcely had they gained the cover of the brush, which was but a stone's throw distance from the wigwam, ere their flight was quickened by the hoarse curses of the buccaneers, whose shouts and cries sounded loudly in their rear, while a shower of balls, followed by the quick reports of the arquebusses, flew thick about them, cutting the air and branches, and shaking down wreaths of snow from the trees around. With the celerity of a squirrel the Indian rushed onwards, dragging his comrades, whose limbs were strained by desperation to the tightest chord; they darted down a rocky and stony path, whose shagged points and splinters pierced their feet at every bound—but yet it staid them not; through hedges dark and tangled, of the strongest rushes, which winter had not been able to destroy, and of which at other times there was not one of them could have bent a branch, they struggled, nor paused to draw a breath; they looked behind but as the panting stag in the hot pursuit, to gather fresh power of limb to speed, from the closer shouts of the hunters. After having pursued a straight course for a considerable distance, the ground becoming more and more unequal, rendered the route tedious and difficult; at last altering their direction of path, the Indian led for a dark grove of gloomy pines, within whose embowering shade they entered; and there owing to the closeness of the trunks of the trees, the snow was not deep, and afforded them more ease in running. And now the cries of the pursuers, and the deep-mouthed bay of their hound, grew more distant; and the scattered reports of their musquetoons, as they fired signals to each other, or at the shadows which deceived them with likeness of the fugitives, grew fainter and fainter, and at last all ceased; and they could hear the quick and heavy beatings of their hearts alone, as they panted against their ribs with the exertion that they had undergone; at length, after nearly an hour's unceasing speed along the most precipitous and unbroken ways, the Indian paused, although his swiftness had been unabated, and he appeared now but little wanting of rest; but his companions were worn down and jaded to sickness; yet now, danger was o'er—and they seated themselves on a small rise of ground which the wind had swept clear of snow, and rested in safety. Wild and tumultuous were the feelings of the traveller—he could scarcely realize the events that had passed; all was like the thronging objects of some swift fleeting vision of sleep, that although transitory and unsubstantial, clings still vividly to the memory; his own action in the incidents of the flight, seemed prompted by impulse alone, that was not to be swayed unshared by the guidance of the mind; indeed so utterly hopeless had he been, so sunken and lost by despair, that not a wish remained, but a speedy extinction of his miseries: and when roused from this bitterness of wo, when freed and rescued from bondage and death, he felt as much overpowered with the sudden change of fortune, as he had been in his uttermost depth of sorrow; he was like the desperate and shipwrecked seaman, who had clung long to the rock, and struggled long in vain to climb from the wave, lifted by some friendly hand to the secure shore, even in the last moment when his strength was failing, and his hold to the bare and slippery side grew weaker and weaker, and his eye was dim with death; and now, though distant from danger, the whelming waters of the unquiet sea, were hurtling in his ears, and still the sky-crowned billows were tumbling in his sight: the limbs of the traveller yet smarted from the bonds that had held him, but he moved them unshackled; his soul drew in the very breath of the free air that wantoned around, but his lips uttered not a sound, though his hand pressed on his swelling and surcharged bosom. “Brother,” said the red man, “the great Spirit hath looked on you with an eye like a father looks on his dearest child—the edge of the tomahawk was sharpened —the fires of the captors were lighted, and the victim was led to the stake; but the arrows of thy enemies have not reached you, but have fallen to the earth as heavily as the musklonghi plunges in the deep lake; and now thou art far from the following of thy foes; the gamesome wekolis that sings in the broad espetonga tree, is not more fearless than thou mayest be brother, the rising sun will show thee the smoke of the white man's fires; thy brethren are within the echo of thy voice.” “Brave, generous preservers—what do I not owe thee?” burst from the traveller as he seized their hands and pressed them fervently within his own, “thou hast saved my worthless life at the risk of your own blood; can I ever make you a return—no—but yet something I may do—you know not whom you have rescued—it may not be proper now—but there will come a time, when it will be mine to grant you favours beyond all you can hope; and when I refuse you what you may ask, even though it be that which I may not well do, yet if I refuse you, I repeat it, may the face of heaven, which hath so smiled upon me, be for ever turned from me.” “Stranger,” said the boy in a solemn and melancholy tone, “I, for my own part, ask nothing of you—yet there may happen that, even in my life, which may cause you to remember what you have just spoken, and that one whom you met in the midst of murderers, and who perhaps had as much cause as they to wish you dead, preserved you from their hands: remember this, I seek no more.” “I will never forget it, and from this moment thou shalt be a constant care to me.” “No, stranger, we were not born to be friends,” replied the youth firmly, “the sun that now wakens on the waters below us, will see our courses divide perhaps for ever.” “Nay, but hear me—” “Thou need'st not speak,” said the stripling, “for words are waste to change my counsel. I am neither friendless, nor deserted; you have been deceived in my appearance; talk not of it—when I want your assistance, I shall not fail to call on you; till then, let the subject sleep—and look down, mark you not through the cleft of you hill, the roofs and spires and masts? Yon is the city.” The quick piercing cold, that preludes a winter morning, had slowly abated; a pallid hue blanched to whiteness the broad eastern sky, and a vivid light ran like fire through the whole heavens; yet when the sun rose, it was dull and dim of aspect: shorn of its tabernacle of glorious clouds of purple and of gold, it looked like some warrior from the field of discomfiture and defeat, his armour stained, his weapons soiled, and his eyes turned earthwards, for very shame at his lost conquest and his flight. A sharp, frosty wind heralded his approach, and as it whistled over the tall heads of the forest and the mountain, drove before its rushing path, mighty clouds of mist and vapour, that had slumbered above the snow from whence they had gathered—yet the wind did not wholly dissipate these dense and voluminous masses, though it blew them along, rendering distinct the deep gullies of the hill and the peaks of the high rocks, throwing the mists that had hid and crowned them, in mingled troops and confused and changeful heaps, that mimicked to the eye of fancy the shapes of crowded armies, of tall castles, ample palaces, and towering pinnacles; but as the sun rose higher, these faded away, and the scene became more plain and clear to the eager sight. They sat on the verge of a hill; behind them lay the forest they had fled through in the night, close, dark, leafless and dreary, unpiercible to the inquiring eye; to the left was a flat waste land, covered with drifts of snow, and chequered with blue ice, that bound the numerous morasses and swamps in a wintry garment, while here and there, on the firmer ground, rose the steep roofs and tall chimneys of some Dutch farm house; to the right, yet lower than where they looked from, lay thickets of dwarf oak, garlanded with icicles that sparkled in the sun, rocks, knolls, and crags, and the varieties of uncultivated nature; and washing the broad bases of these, rolling and curling beneath the morning breeze, and glittering like silver in its course under the sunbeam, flowed a mighty river, whose opposite shores were high hills and banks and waving woods, that twinkled in the light, and over whose tops the fleeing mists hovered in fleecy whiteness, looking like a filmy veil of silver gauze; a howker, with its broad and snowy sails set to the wind and its leeboard up, was riding the waves, looking like the white bosomed cygnet swimming the river, and here and there in the distance, almost lost in the frosty atmosphere, peered forth the sails of other water craft, while dark spots upon the afar off waves, showed the gay islands that gemmed this noble stream Immediately before the gazer's eye stretched out a point of land, dark and black, and where the fog lingered longest, but when at last it cleared away, there was the city to which the boy had pointed, the tiled roofs glittering in the silvery radiance of the now smiling sunlight, and a few domes and spires, that rose above these like spears over the heads of a marching band of soldiers. “Stranger,” said the stripling, “the time hath arrived; we must now separate. Be not surprised when I tell you I know the man and the objects that you seek: but ere I go let me give safely back to your hands, unopened, the packet which I snatched from your reluctant keeping. Think not that I have pryed into these papers; that what I have learnt of you has come from these: it is not so, for your own eyes must convince you that not a seal that holds them hath been even strained.” So saying, he drew forth the papers, and gave them to the surprised and wondering traveller. “Noble, inexplicable boy!” exclaimed he, “how shall I thank you? But do you really intend to leave me, and now?” “Our ways are different,” replied the youth; “yonder road, that leads downwards to the lowlands, will carry you safe and straight to Bayard's Bouwerie—if I mistake not that is the path that will suit you. Mine is to the borders of yon gallant river.” “Yet stay one moment—answer me—you must not leave me thus.” “Brother,” said the Indian, “it is in vain for you to track our footsteps, as for the heavy bear to gain on the speed of the cleft footed moose; thou wilt turn unto the dwellings of the warriors of thy race; our path is towards the setting sun; I have sworn to follow the brave youth who loosened the cords of thy enemies—and the White Skinned Beaver breaks not his oath; my mother the earth, hath taken back the warriors and the children of my name, yet I have found one for whom I would live; my heart was vacant, desolate—but it hath received the balsam that the great Spirit pours in the wounds of the hopeless; brother, thou seekest the fires of the white man—go—yet remember the white man loves not his brother, more than he loves the red Indian—ye belong to one family—ye walk in the same path—yet ye assist not each other to bear your burdens—though ye slake your thirst at the same spring, ye lend not unto each other your cups—brother; beware—the white people are to one another like poisonous serpents; they give not the weary man a place to spread his blanket, or wood to kindle his fires; rather would they be the wolf, to make his wigwam tenantless, and his corn field a desert; they love to take up the hatchet against their brother, and make it fat with blood; they will drink the blood even of their own people. Brother, if we meet not again, may our great Father, who is alike the friend of the white and the red man for we are all his children, protect you as he hath done since the last sunset; may the great Spirit be angry with thy enemies, and destroy them from the earth with his terrible breath, which is a devastating wind—a rushing water.” As the savage finished speaking, he departed after the boy, leaving the traveller to pursue their swift steps with his eyes, in astonishment, as he stood lone and deserted on the rugged side of that high and towering hill.</field>
