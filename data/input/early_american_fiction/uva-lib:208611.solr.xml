      <field name="fulltext">JOHN SMITH'S LETTERS, WITH `PICTERS' TO MATCH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Smithville, Down East, in the state of Maine. April 25, 1839. To Mr. Samuel Colman, No. 8 Astor House, New-York. Dear Sir: I see by some of the papers that you are a goin' to put out a book, containing my letters that I've been writing to the New-York Mirror. That I should ever come to be the writer of a book is what I never expected; but strange things happens now days; and if you think the letters that I and my son John have writ, are worth making into a book, I'm willing you should do it. If you are a goin' to have picters in it, as the papers say you be, I wish you would send me a few of 'em, for there's nothing in this world that my children likes to see so well as they do picters. Cousin Debby says it is the fashion, when any body puts out a book, to have it dedicated to some body; and if you should think it best to put in a dedication, I want it to be to uncle Joshua Downing, of Downingville, out of respect I feel for the memory of my cousin, Major Jack Downing. I don't mean none of your New-York counterfeit Jack Downings, that stole my cousin Jack's name, but my own dear cousin, the Major, that writ all his letters in the Portland Courier, and the Downing Gazette, printed in Portland, State of Maine. I send a dedication that you can put in, if you think it is best. Your friend and well-wisher, JOHN SMITH, Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO UNCLE JOSHUA DOWNING, POSTMASTER OF DOWNINGVILLE IN THE STATE OF MAINE, THE HONEST MAN, THE TRUE BLUE REPUBLICAN, THE STAUNCH FRIEND OF MAJOR JACK DOWNING AND GINERAL JACKSON, THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED WITH THE HIGHEST RESPECTS OF THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRELIMINARY ARTICLE. [Being a communication which appeared in the New-York Mirror, January 12, 1839.] “REASONS FOR JOHN SMITH TO CHANGE HIS NAME. New York, January 12, 1839. Dear sir—There is a subject on which any one might be eloquent, emphatick, energetick, but I fear there is no pen adequate to convey to you the importance of it. It is a curious subject; no less a one than to ask a man to change his name! “Smith, you will certainly have to change your name.” We thought at first of approaching you with a round robin, as the conspirators did in the olden time. We intended to set forth the many and the cogent reasons why such a change should be made, and as our signatures would follow one another in a circle, the ringleader of so daring a proposition would never be known. On the whole, however, it was thought most advisable to write a letter, and I volunteered to incur the risk of your taking offence—as if any one of the name of Smith could take offence at a proposal of this kind. To say your name is Smith is enough—it speaks volumes in itself. To be sure, it is a word of only one syllable, but look at the letters which compose it! They are, individually, the most contemptible in the alphabet, and always serve to usher in whatever is pitiful or worthless, and there is no other method of conveying an impression of a Small— Mean—Insignificant—Trashy—Humbug, but by appropriating the five initials—and these five initials what are they when combined—why SMITH! No honest man would change his name for that of Smith, even were it Sheepshanks, Pot, Kettle, Vinegar or Bellows, of which names there are many on record. He would not change any of these, objectionable as he thinks them, for one that would place him behind a screen all his life. No, he would not take the shadowy name of Smith, even under the expectation of inheriting an estate. Not for the reason that no one of that name could, by any possibility, have an estate to bequeath, but that he would lose his personal identity. I doubt whether there are at this day more than two men who could find any reasons strong enough to be induced to take the name of Smith. These two men—par nobile fratrum—our two recent, glorious defaulters—they might find it convenient to preserve their incognito; and in what way could they effect it so completely as to veil themselves in this misty, gauzy apology of a man? Do you think the police-officers would ever run after a man by the name of Smith? They never pursue the crime, but the criminal, and this criminal must have a name—is Smith a name? ergo, our two noble defaulters would remain unwhipped of justice even on the idle supposition that the government issued warrants against them. “Why don't they prove an alibi?” said Weller, senior. Smith is an alibi in itself. Let rogues, therefore, hide behind this magnetick board, for they will be invisible to us; but, like Dr. Elliotson's two hospital girls in London, this board will be no obstruction to them. Smith, therefore, is a nonentity, a dead letter— a dead letter, did I say! Why, he that owns it is dead and buried. The very playwrights make fun of it. In a recent farce one of the characters is made to say, “Smith, Smith, I am sure I have heard that name before.” Did you ever see a man that did not blush deep crimson when you asked his name, if it be that of Smith? Talk of the man who lost his shadow, Schleimel, I think he was called; what was that compared to the loss of the substance, for he that loses his personal identity is lost indeed. It has often been said that if you are in Broadway and call out Mr. Smith, every tenth man will turn; but if you call out John Smith, every other man will look round. No Smith ever gets rich or gets fame; if by chance one of the name does a clever thing, or writes a clever book, who can identify it? what Smith reaps the benefit of it? The honour is diluted to a homœpathick dose, and the Smith who ought to swallow the whole allopathick credit, gets only the millionth part of a drop of his share. Do you think that the Messrs. Carvill or Harper would be so indiscreet, or so insane, as to buy the 2 copyright of a work from any man by the ubiquious name of Smith? Men never think of calling their dogs Smith. Cæsar, Pompey, Carlo, Napoleon, Victoria, these are the names, but not Smith; a sensible dog would not answer to it. Young puppies might; those that are in their blind state must put up with it till their eyes were open, but no longer. If John Smith were to engrave his name on a dog's collar, tens of thousands would whistle for him, for the name is Legion; nay, if “Legion” were engraved on the collar of a stray dog, the most natural thing in the world would be to carry him to a Mr. John Smith. Every man that wants to travel incog., either to escape civilities or the penitentiary, calls himself Smith; not Smith by itself, but Captain Smith. No woman faints on board a steamboat, or at the theatre, or in Niblo's Garden, but there is a Dr. Smith, nay, several Drs. Smith, ready to officiate. Good, honest, ingenious old Tom Smith, the famous blacksmith that once flourished in Courtlandt-street, told me that he often wondered and wondered, his name being Smith, that he should have been so foolish as to double his cognomen— that he should tack it to head and tail—Smith, the blacksmith! However, said the poor, vexed man, I thank heaven that I am not rich, for I might then have sent my son to college, and as sure as fate he would come out a doctor, which would be worse than all. A Dominie Smith might, perchance, die a bishop, but no thanks to his name; he climbs up the ladder by holding fast to the skirts of some patron saint. He is not Bishop Smith, but the bishop of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, or St. John, or the bishop of Georgia or Maine. No one likes to relate an adventure of which a man by the name of Smith has been the hero, (can such a name belong to a hero?) he dreads the thousand and one questions that will pour out upon him— “Which Smith? Where does he live? Has he a middle name? What is his first name?” Many a good joke, many an excellent anecdote has been smothered, because the name of Smith was in it. Paradise could not hold all that have come and gone by the title of Smith. St. Peter would be afraid of a disturbance; he would not open the gates to let any more in, I am convinced. The proverb says, that if all lost things went to the moon, how full of good advice it would be. And I say that if all doctors went to Old Nick, how full of Smiths his furnace would be. It is said that the legislature will not grant permission to a man to change his name unless it be one that has an improper meaning, such a one that he could not offer to a lady without a blush; or in case of the expectation of an inheritance. Read this letter to them, and they will see at once that Smith is no name at all when inheritance is in question, and that a man does not only blush when offering it to a lady, but even to that august body the legislature themselves. Depend upon it, there will be no debate: you will receive your new name by return of mail. I remain yours, in the hope of this change; but alas! I shall know you no longer if you are still to be John Smith, for crowds upon crowds are flitting before me, and all unreal. You will merge in the misty mass, and become a hallucination. Adieu. A.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2* JOHN SMITH'S LETTER'S. LETTER I. Wherein are set forth divers weighty reasons why John Smith should not change his name. Smithville, Down east, February, 1839 Dear Gineral Morris—I never was more struck up in my life than I was night afore last, about eight o'clock in the evening, when Cousin Debby come running into our house all of a giggle and most out of breath; and says she, “Cousin John, here's news for you; they've got you into the New-York Mirror, as true as my name is Debby Smith.” Says I, what nonsense are you arter now, Debby? for she's always poking fun at somebody or other, although she don't mean nothin' by it, for she's as clever as the day is long. Says she, “I mean jest what I say, John; they've got you in the New-York Mirror, as large as life.” And she held up the paper—Debby takes your paper, and has took it, I believe, going on a dozen years, for she's very fond of larning and has kept school in our village, off and on, about fifteen years—and she held up the paper, and, says she, “John, here's most a column and a half, all about you, every word of it. And they are making something of a fuss about you in New-York too, and say you must change your name.” At that my dander begun to start a little, and, says I, Debby, are you in arnest, or what do you mean? For I knew I hadn't killed nobody, nor robb'd, nor stole a sheep; and, says I, I should like to see the feller that would dare to tell me, to my face, that I ought to change my name. My name is what I've valley'd myself on more than anything else in the world, and there never was a name yet that I'd change it for, unless it was George Washington. But come, says I, Debby, set down and read us your long yarn—Debby is a first rate reader, and she loves to read afore folks as well as she loves to eat. So we made room for her in the ring. We had a rousin' fire, bein' it was a pretty cold night, so we could set back and make room for all; for there was something of a ring of us; our own family isn't small—there's myself and wife, and eleven children, and my mother, and aunt Jane, and my nephew William Smith that works for me; and besides that, there was a number of the neighbours in, setting round to drink a mug of cider with us and eat a few of my fine winter apples. Debby hauled a chair up to the table, and snuffed the candle, and drawed it close to her, so as to hold it between her and the paper; and then the reading seemed to bother her a little, for your paper, Gineral, is rather fine print, and she had to hold it off nearly at arms length and hold the candle close to it, because she said her eyes were weak. Aunt Ruth—she's my uncle John Smith's wife, a very sensible woman, and one of the kindest neighbours there is in our village—she sot on 'tother side of the table with her knittin' work in her hands, and looking over the top of her specs across the table at cousin Debby. She see what was the matter, and pulled off her glasses, and reached them across the table and told Debby she better try her specs, and she thought she would read easier. Debby coloured as red as fire, and said she never used spectacles; and besides, “if I did,” says she, “it isn't likely I could use yourn; they must be a great deal too old for me.” At that my uncle John Smith —he's a blacksmith by trade, and lives close by on 'tother side of the road—he was setting in one corner, digging his teeth into the mellow side of a great sweet apple—he rolled up his eyes at Debby, and haw haw'd right out. Says he, “well done Debby, you've hit it now exactly; my wife is jest five years older than you, and them specs suited her ten years ago.” Debby kind of choked a little, and her face turned redder than ever: I don't know but she would have bit a board nail off, if she'd only had one in her mouth. Uncle John has a teazing kind of a way with him, and when he sees any body nettled, he loves to help 'em along a little. “So,” says he, “Debby, I want a new vice in my shop; what will you take for your teeth? I think they'd hold a pretty good grip.” Debby couldn't stand it no longer—she threw down the paper, and drawed her head back as if she'd had a curb bit in her mouth. Says she, “Uncle John, you are the biggest plague that ever I see, and if you was worth a minding, I would be mad with you.” I see the only way was for us to try to make a kind of a joke of the matter all round, till Debby got cooled down a little; for she was in too much of a flusteration to read now; “So,” says I, “come John, fill up the mug with cider agin and hand it round—this was to my son John; he is my oldest son, and will be seventeen years old if he lives to see the fifth day of next May; a smart boy as you will see one in a thousand, and folks say he takes after me very much”—says I, “Come, John, hand round the cider, beginning with the oldest, clear down to the youngest, and give it to cousin Debby last.” At that Debby begun to laugh, and says she, “Cousin John, you are almost as big a pester as uncle John himself, and one isn't worth a minding any more than 'tother is.” After we took a drink of cider round, and each one took another apple, Debby got so calmed down that we got her hold of the paper again. She wouldn't touch the specs though, but after she got the candle fixed right, she made out to read it very well. And sure enough there was a whole column all about my changing my name. I never felt so queer before in my life. But when she read the line at the top, “Reasons for John Smith to change his name”—says I, “Debby, now before you begin, how do you know that means me? There's more John Smiths in the world besides me.” “Why, because,” says she, “every body knows it means you. Here you've been selectman, of Smithville, this seven years; have been surveyor of the roads, and on the school committee, and town agent, and been twice representative to the Legislater, and had a squire's commission five years; and it's pretty likely the piece could mean any body else but you. Suppose Gineral Washington was alive to this day, and such a piece should be published, saying George Washington ought to change his name? Wouldn't every body know it meant Gineral Washington?” “Well,” says I, “Debby, to be honest about it, I think it pretty likely it does mean me. But let us hear what they have to say in New-York about my changing my name. So, as I said afore, she read it through. Sometimes, when she was reading it, I couldn't hardly keep my dander down, and sometimes I couldn't hardly help laughing to see how ignorant the man that writ it must be of the world. When she got along down to the place that says the five letters that spell Smith, stand for a Small—Mean— Insignificant—Trashy—Humbug, my son John started up as if he'd been shot—he looked as red as a rooster, and says he, “Father, I wouldn't stand that no how; I'd go right to New-York and put it into that chap what writ that are piece.” Says I, “John, you haven't seen enough of the world yet to know which is the best road to mill. You are young and inexperienced, and you must try to keep your temper down and take things more moderate. I shall write to Gineral Morris and get him to see to it, and then, if the feller that's dared to call me a humbug, don't take it back, he must look out—that's all.” “Read on, Debby,” says I. By and by she come to where it said, “no honest man would change his name for that of Smith.” “Stop,” says I, “let us reason about that a little. Honest men don't have occasion to change their names. 'Tis rogues and knaves that change their names; and when they do, they try to pick for the likeliest and most respectable name they can find, and therefore they take the name of Smith. And this is one reason that Smiths are so plenty. There isn't so many real Smiths in the world as folks think for. There are a great many counterfeits about. But that don't hurt the real Smiths, nor make 'em any less respectable. If you had a true silver dollar in your pocket, would you valley it any the less because your neighbour had a pewter one? If you ever come acrost a person by the name of Smith that don't bear a good character, you may depend upon it, Smith isn't his real name—he has changed some other for it. And I've been told, on the very best authority, that all the Smiths that have been hung for any crime, have always confessed privately under the gallows, just before they were swung off, that their true name wasn't Smith, but Johnson, or Davis, or some such name. And now, my dear Gineral Morris, this makes me think of another thing. There was my cousin Major Jack Downing—he's a cousin to me on the mother's side, and as good a feller as ever lived—upright and honest, and no slouch at writing. Well, he went down to Portland, in the State of Maine, seven or eight years ago, and went to writin' letters in the Portland Courier, and then he went off to Washington, and staid along with Gineral Jackson some time, 3 and writ letters to the Portland Courier; and when he got his name up pretty well, folks begun to counterfeit his letters and his name too, like smoke, all over the country. Most all the counterfeits were so badly done, that any body could tell 'em the moment they put 'em along side the true ones. There was one chap in your city that carried on a great stroke of counterfeitin' these letters, and signing Major Jack Downing's name to 'em for a year or two, and I don't know but more—let's see, what was his name? Seems to me it begun with a D—. Well, he used to put in some kind of mettle into 'em that made 'em ring, and had a nack of glossing of 'em over, so that he made 'em go quite current in your city and round there. But you put 'em along side of cousin Jack's, and you'd see in a minute they warn't the true silver. But he didn't care for that, as long as he could make 'em go, and make the folks round New-York think he was the real Major Jack Downing. And that's the way of the world, Gineral; every body wants to go by a good and respectable name, and you may depend upon it that is the true secret why there are so many Smiths.” After Debby had got through reading the piece, we all sot as much as ten minutes, and didn't say nothin'. At last, says I, uncle John, what do you think of it? “Think of it?” Says he —“why, I think it's the foolishest mess of flummery that ever I seed put into a newspaper. In my opinion, it doesn't contain one single good reason why you should change your name. And there is no reason in the world why you should, but a thousand why you should not.” “And what are they, uncle John?” says I. “Why,” says he, “it is a very old and respectable name; it has been in our family a great while; it is therefore an honour to be called by the name of John Smith. And in the next place, it is the most popular name in the country; so that if popularity is worth any thing, that proves John Smith to be the best name in the country. And in the next place, it is a very short name; you don't waste but little time in speaking it, nor but little paper in writing it. And in the next place, there's no sich thing as clipping it off or nicknaming of it; if any body speaks your name at all, they can't make nothin' short of John Smith of it.” Well, aunt Ruth, and cousin Debby, and mother, and aunt Jane, and my wife, and my son John, all expressed the same opinion as uncle John, only some of 'em a great deal more arnest. Mother, she sighed, and said she thought the man must be an a'ful wretch to want to make her son change his name, when it was the best name there was in the whole Bible, especially the John, and she had picked it out when she give it to me, out of that chapter where the angel give it to the child of Zachariah and Elizabeth. My wife, she almost cried, and said she should go crazy, if she thought I should ever change my name, and leave all her children poor orphans. So among all the other reasons, Gineral, aginst my changing my name, you see what a disturbance it would make in my family. And, on the whole, I've made up my mind decidedly; I shan't do it. I don't know how it is in New-York, but down east, and in Smithville, and all round here, not only Smith, but John Smith, is considered the best and most honourable name there is going. It has come down to me in a straight line, clear from Capt. John Smith that first settled in old Virginny. And a braver man than he was never lived. I've got his coat of arms now, that's come down long with his name, three Turks' heads made up in a picter, hanging up in our fore room. I said his name come down to me in a straight line; but it wasn't exactly a straight line, for it crooked out of the line a little in one place, and that was in the case of my father, whose name was James. I'll tell you how it happened. When my grandfather, whose name was John, carried my father to meetin' to be christened, it happened that the same day his cousin John Smith carried two of his children to be christened. And when the minister was ready, my grandfather, bein' a very perlite man, beckoned to his cousin John to carry his children up first. So he carried 'em up, and good old parson John Smith, who preached in grandfather's parish then, whispered to him as he handed up the first child, and asked him its name. His name is John, said my grandfather's cousin. So the parson christened him John. The second child was then handed up, and the parson whispered again and asked its name. His name is John, said my grandfather's cousin. The good old parson shook his head, and whispered again, and told him he had christened the other one John. My grandfather's cousin shook his head too, and told the parson to 3* never mind, but christen him John; “for,” says he “if I had a hundred children, I would call them all John.” So finding there was no turning him, the parson christened the second child John. Then my grandfather went up with his child; and I've heard my grandmother say that his face was red as a blaze all the way goin' up to the pulpit. Well, the minister whispered to him and asked him what the child's name was. Grandfather choked a little, and, says he, “I was a going to call him John, but I think we have had Johns enough for one day; you may christen him James.” Now, Gineral, I don't know but I've tired you with my long yarn. I didn't think of writin' sich a long letter when I begun. But when I get a goin' I'm a little like the steam car on the rail-road; I'm apt to run till I get to the end of the track, or till the fire is out. I've only one thing more to say, and that is, bein' you've had my name figurin' in your paper, I believe I shall subscribe for it. And I guess I ain't the only Smith that will. As I am always called 'Squire Smith round in these parts, I want you to direct it to John Smith, Esquire, Smithville, Down East, and it will come to me straight as a hair. And if you want to hear any thing more about our folks, jest say so in your paper, and I'll scratch down a line or two, once in a while, and send it to you. So I remain your friend and constant reader, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. LETTER II. Wherein Miss Debby Smith, with a becoming juvenile spirit, giveth a slight touch on the other side of the question. Smithville, Down East, latter part of February, 1839. Much respected sir—Excuse my not datin' my letter corect, which is a great trial to me—for if I pride myself on any thing, 'tis in being corect; and I've had the name of it ever since I've kept school in Smithville—but our almanack isn't to home; it's up to uncle John Smith's, not uncle John the blacksmith, but uncle John Smith on my mother's side. My mother was a Smith—not that I'd have you think my father married his relations— the people in Smithville are more corect and think more of the Bible than that—but there's two stocks of Smiths here that go so far back that folks can't tell where they begun. Though grandmother always made it out and stood to it, that they all come from one in the first place, and said it made my father and mother fifth cousins. The old lady is very curis about these things, and she has it all marked out in the shape of a great large tree, and keeps it hung up in the fore room, and when there is any thing said about it, or any dispute takes place about the Smiths bein' related, she takes it down and goes over the whole, clear from the root to the top branch; and always brings it out that my father and mother was fifth cousins. Whenever she has these reckonings, grandfather is as uneasy as a fish out of water, for he thinks if it should go as grandmother fixes it, 'twould make him and grandmother fourth cousins; and he's so corect, that if he should really think it was true, although he's now eighty-five years old, I do believe he'd try to get divorced. So grandfather is always against grandmother in her reckonings, and whenever she sets down to go over the tree, for she always hauls the table up and sets down to it, so as to make no mistake, then grandfather he'll put on his spectacles and take his staff and hobble along and stand and look over grandmother's shoulder, and foller her along up among the branches. But generally in about a quarter of an hour he gets so tangled up, and the branches run together and crossways, and get mixed up so that he breaks off short, and says, “Poh, mother, there's no head nor tail to it. We all come from Adam, accordin' as 'tis in the Bible, and that's all the relation there is about it.” So grandfather 'll hobble back to his chair again, and set and wink and look as uneasy as can be, all the time till grandmother gets through. And grandmother will always stick to it till she gets clear out to the end of every branch, and winds up by saying, “Well, father, it must be so; if they ain't fifth cousins, I don't know what makes fifth cousins.” But, dear me, where am I running to? I haven't said a word about what I was going to when I begun. But when I happened to mention that my mother was a Smith, I was afraid you might take a notion the Smithville folks wasn't quite so corect in their idees about matrimony as they ought to be. So I felt it my duty to stop and explain how it was. To go back to uncle John Smith agin, on my mother's side, he borrid our almanack day before yesterday, and hasn't brought it home yet. He's a clear trial about borrying. Now grandfather is always prompt about every thing. He always has a new almanack in the house the first day of January, and has had every year since I can remember, though to be sure that isn't a great many years, but I mean he always does. But uncle John, on my mother's side, never gets an almanack for the first six months of the year; so he has to come clear down to our house, about three quarters of a mile, once or twice a week, to borry ourn, though the shoes he wears out and the time he spends is worth more than forty almanacks. He's always saying every week he's going to get one, but I never knew him to get one yet till about haying time; and once I knew him to lose a ton of hay that got wet in a shower, while, instead of getting it into the barn, he come down to our house to get the almanack, to see when the moon was to change. But there, I'm running before my story again. The reason, then, that I couldn't give the corect date to my letter is, that my uncle John Smith, on my mother's side, has got our almanack, and it's too fur for me to go up after it to-night; and, the truth is, I must write to-night—I'm in sich a takin' I can't help it, for I've jest got your last Mirror, and been reading over cousin John's letter, and it's put me all in a flutter. It's too bad, I declare,— sich insinuations as he's made against me in that letter is too bad to think of. I didn't think that cousin John, who I've always treated as a brother, though he's a good deal older than me, would a done so, and then to have it printed in your paper and read by every body in New-York, and every where else; dear me, I feel as if I should fly; what will the New-York folks think of me? I was intending to come to New-York next summer and see the place, and I've been saving up something out of my school money a year past, to pay my expenses. I think I've lived long enough in the world to go about a little now and see some other place besides Smithville; not that I've lived very long in the world neither. But I mean, now I've got to be a grown-up young woman. Dear me, it's so lonesome here in Smithville sometimes, for the want of more young society. I've heard there is a good deal of young society in New-York, and I've been almost in fidgets for a year past to go there. But that pesky letter of cousin John's has throwed all the fat in the fire. If I should go there now, every body that I should see would be thinking of the insinuations in cousin John's letter, and I should not feel as if I could hold my head up as I walked the streets. Now, dear Gineral Morris, are you a single man or a married man? for I'm afraid I may be speaking rather too familiar. I do hope you'll get this letter before your next paper comes out, and have them insinuations about me corect; for they are not corect now, and cousin John knows it. He must a done it jest to teaze me. It's true, I have kept school in Smithville fifteen years—I don't deny that—but then I begun when I was quite young; very young indeed. You know sometimes smart girls, that get their edication very young, begin to keep school when they are mere children. And when I begun to keep school I was so young, that I felt every day as if I wanted to go out and play with the childrenn every time they was dismissed. It's true, too, that I've took your paper most as long as cousin John said, for it's ten years the first of last January, since I begun, and I've sent the money for it every year regular. But what if I have took your paper ten years—what does that argu? Why, that I was a good skoller, and took to reading very young. And if cousin John was as 4 fond of lurning as I be, he would a took it years ago too, and not waited till now, and took it jest because there was a piece put in about him. Cousin John knows I've got more lurning than he, and knows that's how I come to take the Mirror so young; for when we used to go to school together, I always kept ahead of him in all the branches, though he was so much older than me: yes, a great deal older than me. And then cousin John is no writer—you see by his letter he's no grammarian. Now, I teach grammar in my school, and have composition besides. And I shouldn't care a pin if you should publish this whole letter of mine, jest to let cousin John know that there's other folks in the world that can write besides him. What he said about aunt Ruth's specs, he must a done jest to teaze me, and for nothing else in the world. My eyes are as good as hisn any day— that is, I can see as well; it's true I read and study so much, they are rather weak, and sometimes plague me about reading. Don't you think, Gineral, your types is a little too small? not that I speak on my own account, for my eyes ain't weak all the time, but on account of elderly people, who find it rather trying to read sich small print. And as to what cousin John said uncle John, the blacksmith, said about buying my teeth for a vice, as though I was mad and gritting my teeth, the idee he conveyed by that was not corect, and it's a plaguy shame he should say it. I'll tell you jest how 'twas. I was setting by the table, and was nipping an apple seed between my teeth, and uncle John, the blacksmith, he sot looking at me, and he see my full round set of large white teeth, for I show my teeth considerable, and though I say it myself, I've got as good a set of teeth as there is in the city of New-York—well, uncle John sot looking at me, seeing me nip the apple seed, and he's a coarse kind of man, you know; so, says he, jest for a joke— “Debby, I want a new vice in my shop; what will you take for your teeth? I think they'd hold a pretty good grip.” As for my being mad, it was no sich thing, for I have the name of being one of the best tempered people in Smithville. And I trust I shall always keep it. But if there is any thing in the world that would sour my temper, it would be the want of young society; and that's one thing makes me so anxious to go to some sich place as New-York, where I can have a plenty of young society. And if them insinuations in cousin John's letter don't operate too much against me, I mean to come to New-York yet. I should like to keep a school there; and, perhaps, you'll be so kind, bein' I've took your paper so long, and always paid you regular and in advance for it, perhaps you'll be so kind as to look round a little for me, and see if there's a good chance for me to keep school any where there. I should like to have it in some part of the city where there is a good deal of young society, you know. I don't know but I ought to say a word or two about the Smith name, that's made sich a fuss in your paper lately. I think cousin John is very set in his way. To be sure, the Smith name round here, is a name that every body likes, and although there is a great many of 'em, yet we never get mixed up so, but that every body can tell who is who and which is which. But, perhaps, the name may not be liked so well in New-York; and, I think, it is about as well always to try to do what will suit the folks best where we live. So it isn't so much to be wondered at, that cousin John should be a little riled at anybody's wanting him to change his name, and that he should make up his mind, as he says, so “decidedly, that he shan't do it.” But cousin John is very set in his way. Thank fortune I ain't so set in mine. And as I said afore, if the name isn't liked so well in New-York, and I was living in New-York, I shouldn't be so very set about not changing it. Now, my dear Gineral Morris, (you see I can't help speaking in that gentle kind of way—good tempered folks are always apt to speak so,) now, this is the first letter I ever writ to an editor, and it makes me feel rather delicate, though I've no doubt it is as good a one as cousin John's; and if you should print this, I want to ask one favour about it. I want you to send a copy of your paper that has it in it, to young Mr. Ichabod Smith, the school-master, at Smithville, upper Post-office. But not let him know that I said any thing about it, for that's a secret between you and me. He's a very respectable young man indeed, and he's been at our house a good deal; but sometimes I think he is more like my uncle John Smith on my mother's side, than he is like my grandfather. I want he should see this letter, and when he finds I'm resolute 4* about going to New-York, I guess he'll-he'll—there Gineral, I declare, my idea confused, I don't know what I was going. So I remain your sincere friend and scriber—no, I mean your young reader, MISS DEBBY LETTER III. Containing, among other matters and things, a chapter on animal magnetism. Smithville, Down East, in the state of Maine, March 1st, 1839. Dear Gineral Morris—I got your very perlite letter last night. The same post brought it that brought your last Mirror, that had cousin Debby's letter in it. About Cousin Debby's letter, where she hinges so hard against me in it, I shouldn't troubled you to take any notice on't, for I don't think she's worth a minding, hadn't it been for the very perlite request in your letter to me, that I should write some more letters to you and let you print 'em in your Mirror. But I feel it my duty now to clear up my character to you a little in respect of truth and verassity, because some parts of Debby's letter seems to go almost head-foremost right against some parts of mine. So to set this matter to rights in short meter, Gineral, I must say that cousin Debby, although she's in the main a very good sort of a gal, yet when any thing nettles her considerable, she will stretch the stockin' a little, that's a fact. And that isn't her worst failin'; for a few years past she's been a good deal given to breaking up matches. So that the young folks, when they take a notion to have any courting goin' on, jest about as lives die as to have Debby get hold on't, for they know she won't rest day or night till she's turned the whole business topsy-turvy, and poured all the fat in the fire. But that's neither here nor there. I ain't agoin' to talk to you about Debby, nor no sich nonsense, but come right down to matters of more importance, tha tyou spoke about in your letter. I was a good deal struck up to find that you and the New-York folks didn't know any more about Smithville; and couldn't even tell what state it was in. It is a very noted place, and has been a good many years. It turned out more soldiers to go down to Portland in the last war, than any town of its size in the state. And didn't you never hear how high politix run in our town when Adams and Crawford was up for president, and I and Ichabod Smith was run for the legislater, and how we voted till ten o'clock at night, tie and tie, and no choice, and then had a knock down and put the candles out, and adjourned till next day? You must have heard about it, and had it in the papers there tu, for it was all the talk about here for months. Not know any thing about Smithville! Seems to me 'tain't possible. Why, we've been represented in the legislater ever since our state was separated from old Massachusetts. I've been there two winters myself; and though I say it myself, I suppose I held as good a rank as most any of 'em there, unless it was a few that was called leading members. I was appointed on the committee on accounts and on the committee on dividing towns, and the speaker used to most always stop and speak to me as he was going out of the house after we was adjourned. I can't see how it is possible that New-York shouldn't know a good deal about Smithville; more especially as it jines Downingville, and Downingville is known by every body in New-York and all over the country. And moreover, Downingville is only a child, as it were, of Smithville; for they was both one town at first, and Smithville was the mother town, and Downingville was set off from Smithville in the year 1811, the year before the last war broke out. I don't mean this new war that's going on down here to the north-eastern boundary, but what's always been called the last war. It seems strange that Downingville should be known more than Smithville—that the child should get ahead of the mother—though I know it seems to be a kind of a law of nater, that children should out-do their parents, and make more noise in the world than their parents ever did. I'm considerable ahead of what my father ever was; he never had a squire's commission, nor never was a representative to the legislater. And then here's our state of Maine—you know she's the daughter of old Massachusetts—well, she's getting up in the world faster than ever her mother did, and is running ahead of her like smoke. She's got so big she won't take an insult from the biggest nation in the world. If Great Britain plagues her a little about cutting down some of her pine logs, by the gracious! she don't stop to ask no questions, but flies right in her face, tooth and nail, and tells Grent Britain if she wants to fight, she's the boy for her. Now old Massachusetts never would a dared to done that in the world. She would a looked over her shoulder and hollered to Uncle Sam to come and help her, as hard as she could scream, before she would struck a blow. But somehow or other I believe children do have more spunk than their parents after all. Their dander seems to start quicker. There's my son John— you let any body insult him or me or any of the family, and he's into 'em in a minute. A regiment wouldn't stop him. I should like to give you an account of some of his tantrums if I had time, although he isn't seventeen years old till the fifth of next May. I was glad to find you and the New-York folks thought so much of my 'tother letter, and wants me to write again; though I feel a little kind of streaked about writin' letters for you to print in your Mirror, along side of them are fine pieces that you have from men of great larning. Though I don't know that I have any need to be ashamed of my larning, for all Debby hinges as though it wasn't as good as hern. She may know more than I do about needle-work and grammar and these fine arts; but when you come down to the solid branches, sich as ciphering, suing folks, duing town business, and working politix, she's no more than a baby to me; I can wind her round my finger in every one of 'em in two minutes. You say you want me to tell you all about Smithville and Smithville folks, where our ancestors come from, and how long they've lived here, and how we've got along and built our town up and made sich a smart place of it, and give you my views about matters and things in general. Now that, according to my notion, Gineral, is pretty considerable of a broad question, especially the matters and things in general; for I find there is a good many things in this world; and I guess there's some that your New-Yorkers hain't thought of yet. But I'm kind of puzzled to know whereabouts I better begin. I don't know whether I better begin at the root of the matter and trace it all out in rotation, as grandmother does when she goes over the Smith tree, that Debby told you about in her letter, or whether I better begin at the top and so work down along, as they say the freemasons do when they build their chimblies. Sometimes I've a good mind to begin right in amongst the matters 5 and things in general, which, I take it, means animal magnetism. But I see Mr. John Neal is writing for you on that subject, and has got along as far as the “Notch of the White Hills” and “the gloves.” But I don't know as there would be any harm in having two hands at the same job, and as there's matters and things enough in the world to last two of us considerable time, I don't know but I might as well, and I believe I will, write a little about animal magnetism tu. I think I should like to write along side of John Neal, he goes ahead so much like a steam-engine. ANIMAL MAGNETISM. Smithfield Burying-ground.—The Apparition. It was a bright moonshiny night, as you will see one in a hundred—'twas in the latter part of September, and the weather was jest about warm enough to be comfortable. `Twas a Sunday night— I had my go-to-meeting clothes on, and had been over to see Sally Newbegin, she that's now my dear wife, at this very blessed moment. I didn't marry a Smith, but a Newbegin. I took a fancy to that name, because grandmother used to say, when one got married, they always had to begin the world anew; and I thought if I could marry a Newbegin, my world would be already pretty well begun. And Sally was a fine gal, though I say it. And I had to get up pretty early, and set up pretty late tu, to get her, for most all the young fellers in Smithville, and near about a score from Downingville was after her one while. But Sally never staid with any of 'em but me, for she always took a liking to me ever since we went to school together. Well, this night we sot talking in the fore room, till the old brass clock struck twelve, and then I told Sally that I must go. She said she didn't believe but what the clock was too fast. So I sot down again a minute, or I didn't think it was a bit more than ten minutes, when the plaguy old clock struck one. I sprung and catched my hat, and bid Sally good night, and started for home as fast as I could go. I had to go nearly two miles; and about half a mile before I got home, I had to go by the burying-ground, that was close by the road. 'Twas a very lonesome sort of a place. There was thick woods on 'tother side of the road, and 'twas nearly half a mile to any house. When I got along in sight of the burying-ground, I naturally begun to think over who was buried there; and about one that was always supposed to be murdered—for a good many folks have always thought there's been one murder committed in Smithville; and then I thought how aunt Jane was once frightened most out of her senses coming along by the burying-ground, between daylight and dark, and always stood to it she see an apparition. I always used to laugh at her about it, and have made her as mad as fire a hundred times, whenever she sot out to tell the story; for I didn't believe nothin' about ghosts and apparitions; and aunt Jane would always turn around to me when she got through the story, and say, “well there, John, I hope if you live you'll see an apparition.” I felt as if I'd done wrong in hurting aunt Jane's feelings so many times, for she's a clever creatur as ever lived; and then the thought come over me, as I got along within about twenty rods of the corner of the burying-ground, “what if aunt Jane's wish should come true?” My flesh kind of crawled a little, but I wouldn't mind it—apparitions wasn't nothin' but old women's whims—I clinched my hands a little tighter and walked along, and begun to whistle a little; not very loud, but a low tune, jest to show that I wasn't afraid. The dark shadows of the woods begun to fall across the road, for the moon had got down some ways behind the trees. It seemed as if the place was dreadful still; and I felt my flesh crawl again. I stopped whistling—the place was so still I couldn't whistle—when all at once I heard a most terrible groan. My hair ris right up, and I thought my heart would a jumped out of my mouth. It wasn't so loud a groan as some, but a low, distressed, awful sound, sich as I never heard before in my life. I stopped short, for I couldn't move a step one way nor 'tother; my feet seemed to grow to the ground. The groan come agin, and the shudders run over me like a streak of lightning. The sound seemed to be a little ways ahead of me, and as I looked along, about a half dozen rods, I see a white thing, about as long as a coffin, laying across the road. I couldn't feel no skeerder than I was before, but the sweat begun to pour off of me like rain. The groan come agin, and I was sure it come from the white thing across the road. It looked about 5* as large as a man, and white enough to be a winding sheet wrapped round it. I begun to feel it was possible there might be sich things as apparitions, and I felt like death to think I had hurt aunt Jane's feelings so much about it. It didn't move any, but laid still and groaned. I thought at first I would speak to it, but I couldn't muster courage enough. What could I do? My courage never failed before. I went back a few steps, keeping my face all the time towards the apparition; for I couldn't help feeling convinced now that 'twas an apparition. I could go home another way, by going round nearly three miles, but what good would that do? apparitions could go faster than I could. I went back a few steps farther, without taking my eyes off of it; it didn't follow me, but laid still in the same place. I begun to feel my courage come a little—I never was a coward; but I didn't know what to do—I couldn't go forward, and I wouldn't go back. I picked up a little round stone, about as large as a hen's egg, and threw it towards the apparition—not hard, but rolled it along the ground, jest far enough to hit it easy. In a moment it sprung up on eend and fell down again twice; and groaned louder than ever. But I minded, both times it fell, it didn't fall towards me, but from me. After a minute or two, I thought I'd try that motion again. I threw another stone. The apparition sprung up on its feet jest as it did before, and fell down again, with its head from me. At this my courage begun to come a little more, and I ventured to go along a few steps nearer, once in a while throwing a stone. The apparition seemed to be afraid of me, and every time I threw a stone it would seem to jump about its length from me. At last it got along to a place where the moonshine come down between the trees on to it, and I got up to within about two rods of it, and all at once my heart was as light as a feather. It was nothing but uncle John Smith's old hog, that had got his forefeet both up through his yoke, and was half choked to death, and could only spring up on his hind feet and groan. A fiddle-stick take your apparitions, said I, and I went whistling half the way home, determined to hecter aunt Jane about her apparitions harder than ever. In respect of your invitation, Gineral, for me to come to New-York and make a visit, there's nothing would suit me better, for I've always wanted to see that are place, and if I can bring my business about so as to make it convenient, I think I shall do it. I remain your sincere friend, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. LETTER IV. The war in our disputed territory.—The drafting at Smithville. Smithville, Down East, in the state of Maine,0 March 8, 1839. Dear Gineral Morris—I was going to give you a kind of a history of our folks and our town— going away back to the beginning, and so coming down along in course, but we have been in sich a flustration here about the war for a week past, that I can't think of any thing else, nor write about any thing else, till the flurry is over. My son John has gone down to the boundary war, along with the rest of 'em, and we feel bad enough about it, I can tell you. He's too young to go, I know; he's a mere stripling of a boy yet, as I told you in my 'tother letter; he won't be seventeen years old till the fifth day of next May, if he should live to see it. But the poor boy may never live to see that day now, for he's taken his life in his hands, and gone to fight for his country like a man and a hero, live or die. It was a tryin' time to us, Gineral; it was a tryin' time—but I may as well tell you the story, and then you'll know. After we heard the British had taken our Land Agent, and carried him off to New-Brumzick, we begun to look out for a squall. It was about dark when the post brought the papers that had the account of it; so, arter supper, we all went into grandfather's to talk the matter over; for grandfather knows more about sich matters than any body else in Smithville,—he was out three years in the revolution, and was in the battle of Lexington before he listed, and had the fore-finger of his right hand shot off in the battle of Bunker-hill, jest as he was pulling trigger, and aiming at a British officer that was hurrying up the hill, and driving his soldiers up like a fury. But grandfather always says he didn't lose his shot by it; for when he found that finger was gone, and wouldn't pull, he tried the next finger, and the old gun went without losing his aim, and the British officer fell; and he always believed 'twas his shot brought him down. Though grandfather is eighty-five years old now, and is so lame that he can't walk about much, yet his mind holds out remarkably, and he can talk about these things as smart as ever he could. His house stands right aside of mine, only far enough apart for a long shed between 'em, and he used to live in the same house with me, or rather I lived in the same house with him, till I had so many children, and my family got so large, 'twas rather worrisome to the old gentleman, and we was rather scant of room, so I built another house, and moved into it, and got cousin Debby to live with the old folks, and take care of them. So, as I said afore, arter supper we took the papers and went into grandfather's, and I sot down and read it all over to him, how a parcel of the British come over into our disputed territory, and went to cutting down our timber like smoke, so as to steal it, and carry it off in the spring, when the rivers open, away down to New-Brumzick; and how our new governor, Mr. Fairfield, as soon as he heard about it, sent Mr. McIntire, the land agent, and a hundred and fifty men to put a stop to that stealin' business, and ketch the fellers if he could, and bring 'em off; and how Mr. McIntire took his men, and marched away off down there into the woods, ever so fur, into our disputed territory, and got all ready, and was jest a going to ketch the fellers, and bring 'em off up to Augusta, when the thieving chaps turned about, and ketched him, and put him on a sled, and hauled him off away down to Frederickton, in New-Brumzick, and put him in jail. When I got along so fur, grandfather couldn't hold still no longer—he struck his staff down on the floor, jest as if it had been a training-gun, and says he: “John, there 'll be trouble; you may depend upon 't there 'll be trouble. If our people will stand that, they ain't made of sich kind of stuff as the old revolution folks was made of, nor nothing like it. In them days, if the British had a took one of our men, and hauled him off to Frederickton, and put him in jail, every man in the old Bay State, and every boy, tu, that was big enough to carry a gun, would a shouldered it, and marched to New-Brumzick, and Fredericton jail would a been stripped down in no time, and Mr. McIntire brought home agin.” 6 Says I, “father, you mistake”—I most always call the old gentleman father, since my father died, and he's always been a sort of father to all of us, and to every body in Smithville, from oldest to youngest—says I, “father, you mistake; your revolution folks couldn't a brought Mr. McIntire home again, for he was not there in them days— it's Mr. McIntire that's in jail now.” “Yes, they would,” said the old gentleman, rising out of his chair, and striking his staff down on the floor harder than he did afore; “they'd a gone after Mr. McIntire, or any other man living, that had American blood in his veins, and they'd a brought him back, if they'd had to fit their way through forty New-Brumzicks for him. Ain't the people waking up about it no where? ain't they going down to give them New-Brumzicks a thrashing?” I looked at my son John, and I see his face was all of a blaze; and he looked as if he was jest a going to burst out. Says I, “John, my boy, what's the matter?” His face grew redder, and the tears come into his eyes, and he struck his fists together, hard enough to crack a walnut. “By king,” says he, “father, I wish I was old enough to train; I want to go down there and help to give them are British what they deserve.” “By the memory of George Washington!” said my grandfather, “I wish I was young enough to train; I should like to shoulder my gun agin, and go and teach them New-Brumzickers better manners. But what are they duing at Augusta? Ain't there no stir about it yet?” Says I, “we'll read on and see.” So I looked over the papers a little more, and found the governor had ordered ten thousand of the militia to be drafted to go down and keep the British out of our disputed territory, and prevent their stealing our pine timber. “That looks something like it,” said my grandfather; “that's a little like the spunk of old seventy-six. The British 'll have to let our disputed territory alone now, or else they 'll have to come to the scratch for it. I wish I was twenty years younger, I'd go down as a volunteer.” “I wish I was only two years older,” said my son John, “then I should stan' a chance to be drafted; and if I wasn't drafted, I'd go whether or no.” At that my wife and grandmother both fetched a heavy sigh. Grandmother said, she thought father had been through wars enough in his day to rest in his old age, and let sich things alone. My wife, she wiped her eyes, for they was full of tears, and begged John not to talk so, for he was too young ever to think of sich things. And then she turned to grandfather, and asked him if he really thought there was going to be any war. “Yes,” said grandfather, “jest as true as the sun will rise to-morrow, there 'll be a war, and that pretty soon, tu, unless the New-Brumzickers back out, and give up Mr. McIntire, and let the timber on our disputed territory alone. The orders will be up here, to draft the militia within two days, and I shouldn't be surprised if they should be called out before to-morrow morning.” At that my wife and the gals had a pretty considerable of a crying spell. After we'd talked the matter all over, we went home and went to bed; but we didn't any of us rest very well. My wife she sighed herself to sleep arter a while; and I heard my son John, arter he got to sleep, muttering about guns and the British, and declaring he would go. I had jest got into a drowse about midnight, when I heard a heavy knock at the door. I sprung out of bed, and went and looked out of the window, and asked who was there. “Sargent Johnson,” was the reply. “We've got to stan' a draft to-night. The governor's orders got here about an hour ago. We're sending round to warn our company to meet up here to Mr. Wilson's tavern, at two o'clock this morning; it's near about one now, and the captain wants Squire Smith to come over and help see about making the draft. He wants to get through with it as soon as he can, so them that's drafted may be getting ready, for they've got to set out to Bangor at eight o'clock this morning.” I told him I would come right over; and so I lit a candle and dressed myself as quick as I could, and come out into the kitchen to put on my boots, and who should I find there but my son John, all dressed, and his cap on, ready for a start. He had heard what had been said, and it put the fidgets right into him. Says he, “father, I want to go over and see 'em draft.” I told him he better be abed and asleep, by half. But he said he couldn't sleep; 6* and I found the boy was so arnest to go, that I finally told him he might. We hadn't more than got dressed, before we heard the drum beat, over to Mr. Wilson's tavern; so we started off and went over. When we got there, they had a fire in the large hall, and the company was most all there. The captain had got a bowl and some black beans and white beans all ready, and he wanted me to draw for them, so they might all feel satisfied there was no partiality. There was one sargent to be drafted, and we drew him first; and it fell to Sargent Johnson. He stood it like a man; I didn't see as he trembled or turned pale a bit. He looked a little redder, if any thing, and kind of bit his lip as he took his gun and marched into the middle of the floor, and turned round and looked at the company, and says he; “I'm ready to go and fight for our country to the last drop of my blood, but what we'll make the British back out of our disputed territory, and stop their thieving.” The company gave three cheers for Sargent Johnson, and then we went to drafting the privates. There was sixty in the company, and ten was to be drafted. So they took fifty white beans and ten black ones, and put 'em into the bowl, and held it up, so nobody couldn't look into it, and I was to draw 'em out as the orderly sargent called out the names. So when we got ready to begin, the sargent sung out— “William Jones—” I put my hand into the bowl and drawed, and sung out— “White bean.” “Peter Livermore,” cried the sargent. Peter Livermore started, as if he'd had a shock from an electrical machine; his legs shook a little, and he looked in the face as if he felt rather bad. I put my hand in and drawed, and sung out— “White bean.” Peter looked better in a minute. He's a great tall six-foot chap, and looks as if he could almost whip a regiment of common fellers himself; and, although he's something of a brag, it's generally thought, when you come right up to the pinch of the game, he's a little cowardly. Peter stretched his head back, and straddled his legs a little wider, and looked round on the company, and says he— “I swow, I thought I should a been drafted, and I almost wish I had. It would a been fun alive to a gone down there, and had a brush long with them are New-Brumzickers. My old fowling-piece would a made day-light shine through fifty of 'em in half an hour's fighting. I swow I'm disappinted—I was in hopes I should been drafted.” The company knew Peter too well to mind much what he said; they only laughed a little, and the sargent went on, and called out— “John Smith, the third.” I drawed to it, and says I, “White bean.” The sargent called out again, “John Smith, the seventh.” That was the oldest son of uncle John Smith, the blacksmith; a smart boy, about twenty-three years old. Somehow, as soon as I heard his name, I kind of felt as if he was going to be drafted; and I put in my hand and drawed, and sure enough, I sung out— “Black bean.” John shouldered his gun in a minute, and marched out into the middle of the floor, and took his stand beside Sargent Johnson. He looked so resolute, and marched so quick, that the company at once give three cheers for John Smith, the seventh. “John Sanborn,” cried the sargent. “White bean,” said I. “Ichabod Downing,” said the sargent. I drawed, and answered the same as before, “White bean.” `Jeremiah Cole,” called out the sargent. “Black bean,” said I; “black bean for Jerry.” After waiting a minute, the captain called out, “where's Jerry Cole? Isn't Jerry here?” “Yes, setting down behind here on a bench,” answered a half a dozen at once. “Come, Jerry, come forward,” said the captain, “let us see your spunk.” By-and-by, Jerry come creeping out from behind the company, and tried to get across the floor; but his face was as white as a cloth, and he shook and trembled so he couldn't scarcely walk. He let his gun fall on the floor, and sot down in a chair that stood by the side of the room, and boohoo'd out a crying like a baby. “Well done,” said the captain, “there's spunk for you.” “What's the matter, Jerry? can't you go?” “Boo-hoo,” said Jerry, “I ain't well at all—I'm very sick, captain; I don't think I could go any way in the world.” “Well, well,” said the captain, “leave your gun, and you may run home as fast as you can go and see your mother, and we'll get somebody else to go in your room.” At that Jerry darted out of the door, and pulled foot for home, like a streak of lightning. “Where's Peter Livermore,” said the captain; “he may take Jerry's place, bein' he was disappinted at not bein' drafted.” And he called Peter, and told him to take Jerry's gun, and stand up in the floor with the drafts. Peter coloured as red as you ever see, and begun to sweat. At last, says he, “Captain, I don't see how I can go any way in the world, my family's out of wood and meal, and a good many other things, and I couldn't leave home.” “Oh,” says the captain, “we'll take care of your family while you are gone, Peter. Come, take the gun; don't stop to parley.” “But, captain,” said Peter, the sweat beginning to roll off of his face, “if I'd been drafted, captain, I'd a gone with the greatest pleasure in the world, and shouldn't wanted no better fun. But somehow or other, it seems to me like presumption, to go to throwing myself into danger, when it wasn't my lot to go. I shouldn't like to go, captain, without I was drafted.” “Well, well,” said the captain, “you needn't go; we want no cowards to go. But who is there here, among the spectators, or among the men whose names have been called, that isn't afraid to take Jerry's gun and fill Jerry's place. If there's any one here that's willing to go, let him come forward.” At that my son John sprung like a young tiger, and seized Jerry's gun, and jumped into the middle of the floor and stood up by the side of Sargent Johnson, and shouldered his gun with so much eagerness, and looked so fierce and determined, although nothing but a striplin' of a boy, that the whole company burst out in three tremendous cheers for John Smith, the tenth—that's what he's numbered; we go accordin' to numbers in the village. The captain asked me if I was willing he should go. I never was so tried in my life. For my own part, bein' the boy was so brave and wanted to go so much, I should a said yes. But then I knew it would almost kill his mother. So, what to do I didn't know. But I found the boy had got his mind so fixed upon going, that if he didn't go it would about kill him. So, on the whole, I told the captain yes, he might put his name down. Then we went on with the drafting again and got all through without any more trouble, and got ready to go home about three o'clock. The captain told them that was drafted, that they must all be ready to march at eight o'clock in the morning, and they must be in front of the tavern at that hour, and start together for Bangor. My son John and I then went home, and made up a fire and routed the folks all out, and told 'em John was listed, and got to start at eight o'clock, to fight for our disputed territory. Sich an outcry as there was for about half an hour, I guess you never heard. My wife couldn't a cried harder if John had been shot dead there before her feet, though she didn't make much noise about it; for she always cries to herself. The older gals, they cried considerable louder; and some of the younger children, that didn't hardly understand what the trouble was about, sot in and screamed as loud as they could bawl. At last, says I, “there's no use in this noise and fuss; the boy's got to go, and he's got to be off at eight o'clock tu, and the sooner we set ourselves to work to get him ready, the better. That seemed to wake 'em up a little. My wife went to work and picked up his clothes, and she and the gals sot down and mended his shirts and stockins, and fried up a parcel of dough-nuts for him to put in his knapsack, and got him all fixed up and breakfast ready about six o'clock. We hadn't waked up old grandfather in the night, bein' he's so old; but in the morning we let him know about it, and he wanted my son John to come in and see him before he went; so we went into the old gentleman's room. “Now John, my boy,” said the old gentleman, “I feel proud to hear sich a good report of you. You'd a made a good soldier in the days of the revolution. 'Twas such boys as you that drove the British from Lexington, and mowed 'em down on Bunker-hill. You'll feel a little queer at first when you see the enemy coming up to you with their guns pinted right at you; and, brave as you 7 are, you'll feel a little streaked. But you musn't mind it; as soon as they've fired once, you won't feel any more of it, and won't keer no more about 'em than you would about a flock of sheep. But don't be in a hurry to fire—mind that—don't be in a hurry to fire—they told us at Bunker-hill not to fire till the enemy got up so near we could see the whites of their eyes. And 'twas a good rule; for by that means we let 'em get up so near, that when we did fire, we mowed 'em down like a field of clover, I can tell you. Be a good boy, John, and don't quit our disputed territory as long as there is any dispute about it.” By this time we see 'em begin togather in the road up by the tavern, and I told John it was time to be off; so he took his gun, and his knapsack, which was pretty well stuffed, for each of the children had put in a dough-nut or an apple, or a piece of cake, after their mother had crammed in as much as she thought he could carry, and then he marched away like a soldier up to the tavern. When they started, they had to come down again by our house and go up over a rise of land 'tother way about half a mile, before they got out of sight. So we all stood out in a row along by the side of the road to see 'em as they went by. Grandfather got out as fur as the door-step and stood leaning on his staff, and grandmother stood behind him with her specs on, looking over his shoulder; and the rest of us, with the children and cousin Debby and all, went clear out to the side of the road. Pretty soon they come along by, Sargent Johnson at the head, and the rest marching two and two. When they got along against us, little Ned run up and tucked another great apple into John's pocket, and my wife called out to him, “Now do pray be careful, Johnny, and not get shot.” Then grandfather raised his trembling voice, and says he, “Now, John, my boy, remember and don't be in a hurry to fire.” And the children called out all together, “good-by, John, good—by John,” each repeating it over three or four times. John looked round and nodded once, when his mother called out to him, but the rest of the time he held his head up straight and marched like a soldier. We stood and watched 'em till they got clear to the top of the hill and was jest a going out of sight, when all to once John stepped out one side, where we could see him, and let his old gun blaze away into the air, and in a minute more they were out of sight. “Ah,” said old grandfather, “that sounds like Bunker-hill; that boy'll do the business for them New-Brumzickers, if they don't let our disputed territory alone.” We feel dreadful lonesome, Gineral, since John went away. It seems as if our family is most all gone, now he's gone. If you should hear any thing about his fighting down there to our disputed territory, I wish you would put it in your paper, for we shall feel dreadful anxious till we hear from him. So I remain your friend and subscriber, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. 7* LETTER V. Wherein young John Smith, the tenth, describeth the march of the Smithville detachment, down to our Disputed Territory also, relateth the occurrence of a remarkable mistake, that came near putting to flight two belligerent forces. Smithville, Down East in the State of Maine, March 19, 1839. Dear Gineral—I've jest got a letter from our son John, and as I s'pose you hain't heard from him yet, since he went down to fight disputed territory, I thought I would set do write a line or two, and send you John's letter, all but a few lines he writ to his marm and the children, which don't seem to have much to do about the war. I 'spose you might get the news from our disputed territory by the way of Smithville, as quick as any way, for the post from Houlton, on the upper road, comes right by here. I got John's letter last night, jest before bed-time. I went in and read it over to old grandfather; and the old gentleman was so rejoiced about it, he couldn't hardly sleep a wink all night. But I musn't write any more myself; if I do, I shan't have room to give you all of John's letter; and I want to give it to you in his own words; for, accordin' to my notion, although he's but a striplin' of a boy yet, and won't be seventeen years old till the fifth day of next May, yet, accordin' to my notion, he writes remarkable well. He went to school to cousin Debby in his younger days, and since that, I've teached him the solid branches myself. But John writes as follers: Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the Line, March the 13th, 1839. Dear Father—I take my pen in hand to let you know that I'm as hearty as a bear, and hope these few lines will find you, and mother, and grandfather, and cousin Debby, and all the children, enjoying the same blessing. We stood our march remarkable well, and are all alive, and safe, and sound as a whistle. And Sargent Johnson makes a most capital officer. He's jest sich a man as is wanted down here—there's no skeering him, I can tell you. He'd fight against bears, and wild-cats, and the British, and thunder and lightnin', and any thing else, that should set out to meddle with our disputed territory. And he's taken a master-liking to me, too, and says if he has any hard fighting to do, although I'm the youngest in the company, he shall always choose me first for his right-hand man. He says I had more pluck at the drafting than any one in the whole company, and he should rather have me by his side in battle, than any three of the rest of'em. But maybe you'd like to hear something about our march down here, and so on. For the first four or five hours, we marched rather too fast, and got pretty nigh tuckered out; for we was all so arnest to get down there before the first battle come on, that we almost run half the time. At last, about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins—you know what a short-legged little fat chunk of a thing he is—he begun to lag behind a good deal, and puffed and sweat as bad as our colt when we plough alone with him. At last, as I said afore, about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins, who had got away a good many rods behind us, stopt short in the middle of the road, and called out to Sargent Johnson as loud as he could holler, and says he, “It's no use; I can't run like a hoss all day, and without a mouthful to eat, tu. I'm half starved now, and as tired as a dog. I say, Sargent Johnson, we must stop and rest a little while, and have something to eat, or I can't keep up with you no longer, and it's no use to try.” At that Sargent Johnson ordered us to halt till Billy come up. So the poor feller come puffing along up to us, and rubbing his arm across his forehead to wipe the sweat off; and the sargent told him, bein' it was past one o'clock, we'd halt, and have some refreshments. There was a house a little ways ahead of us, and a plenty of wood piled round the door-way, that would make good seats for us to set down on; so we marched along up to it, and halted, and sot down on the wood-pile, and took off our knapsacks, and got out our victuals, and begun to eat our dinner. Presently, the old gentleman of the house looked out of the window and see us, and he opened the door, and come right out to us, without any hat on, and says he, “My boys, are you going down to fight for our disputed territory?” Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest exactly what we was up to. “That's right,” said the old gentleman, “and you look like brave fellers, too. Our company started off yesterday, and one of my boys has gone with it. I hope you'll be able to get there about as soon as they do, so that our side may be strong-handed before the first fight comes on.” Sargent Johnson told him he was determined to be there before the first battle come on, if possible, and meant to have a hand in't too. “Ah, you're the boys for me,” said the old gentleman; “if I was a few years younger, and wasn't quite so lame, I believe I should go with you. Did you ever hear any thing so impudent as 'twas for them British to carry off our land agent as they did? and then to be stealin' logs on our disputed territory—why, it makes my blood bile, when I think of it. But, come, don't set out here on the wood-pile; come, go into the house and eat your dinners, and you shall have as much of my cider as you can drink.” We thanked him, and told him we didn't keer if we did. So we went in, and had a good drink of cider with our victuals, and sot and rested ourselves nearly an hour, and then marched along again. We took it a little slower in the afternoon, so that Billy Wiggins made out to keep up with us pretty well. We got to Augusta about sunset; and jest as we was marching along by the State-house, which is a very fine building, more than as big again as our barn, and all made of hewed stone, and stands up on a little hill, pretty near the road; so, jest as we got along against the State-house, the Legislater was adjourned, and the folks was all coming out in a heap, right down towards the road. “Halt,” cried Sargent Johnson, all at once. “Left face; front, dress; rear rank close to the front: heads up.” Then he run along and whispered to us, and says he, “Now boys, we'll give 'em a solute; and I want you should do it man-fashion. Now you mind and have your guns well shouldered, and be very careful to mind the word of command, and all shoot at once. You must mind and pint your guns high, so as to go over every body's heads, for you know there's balls in 'em—and these ain't the British folks that we are going to fire at now, remember that. I shall give the word of command, make ready, take aim, fire—and when you hear the word fire, you must pull trigger all at once, and blaze away like thunder.” We all told him we would, and he went along and took his stand at the head of the company. We'd all kept our guns well loaded during the day, for fear what might happen, and we shouldered 'em as the sargent told us, and got all fixed, and stood with stiff upper lips, and all ready to fire. Jest as the main body of the legislater-folks and the people got along down within about two rods of the road where we stood, Sargent Johnson hollered out, with a good loud military voice, “Make ready—” Crack! went Billy Wiggins' gun—smoke, powder, wad, and every thing blazing into the air. I never see any body so struck up as Sargent Johnson was—he coloured as red as a blaze, and looked as if he would a bit Billy Wiggins' head off. But when he see the rest of us held on, and didn't pull, he plucked up courage again, and give the rest of the word of command. “Take aim—Fire—” In a moment we all pulled, pretty near together, tu, and if we didn't give 'em a real stunder, I won't guess again. Some of the people jumped, and some squat like geese going into a barn door. But when they found nobody wasn't killed, they come along down to the road, and inquired of Sargent Johnson what town we come from, and shook hands with us, and seemed to be very glad to see us, and said they was glad we'd got along; for things looked terrible squally down to our disputed territory, and the sooner we could get there the better. Bime-by Governor Fairfield come out of the State-house, and come along down to the road, and says he, “My brave fellow-soldiers, I'm glad to see you, what town do you come from?” Sargent Johnson told him we was the Smithville detachment, and was on our way down to our disputed territory, and if he had any commands to send that way, we should be happy to carry 'em. The governor's a little piece of a man to look at; but they say he's got grit enough aboard for two 8 common sized men. He said he had no particular commands to send by us, only he wanted us to get down there as quick as we possibly could, and report ourselves to Colonel Jarvis, and he would take command of us, and tell us what to do. And, says he, “I want you to tell Jarvis to hold on down there like a dog to a root, and not give up an inch to them British chaps; if he wants more men, only send word to me, and he shall have 'em by regiments, as many as he wants. But tell him never to give up an inch; if Sir John Harvey frets—let him fret. But above all, tell Jarvis to hold on to the logs, live or die. And now my brave fellers,” said the governor, “it's too late for you to go any further to-night; you shall have a chance to sleep in one of the lobbies of the State-house, and I'll see that you have victuals and drink provided for you; and I want you to be under way again by sunrise in the morning, whether I am up or not.” So we bid the governor good night, and he sent a man to show us the way into the State-house, and to bring us what we wanted to eat and drink. And we fared well, too, I can tell you—a plenty of bread and meat, and hot coffee, and a basket of apples. We helped ourselves you may depend, as though we hadn't had any thing to eat for a month. The legislater-folks come back in crowds and flocked round the door, and a great many of 'em come in and talked with us about the war down in our disputed territory. They all said the land was ourn, every inch of it, and we must stick to it, and not give up a single tree; for the legislater was determined to stand by us, and would vote to pay all the expenses. After they'd all cleared out, we laid down and took a nap. And about an hour before sunrise I got up and looked out, and see 'twas all broad daylight; so I went and touched Sargent Johnson, and told him 'twas time to be stirring. He sprung on his feet quicker than if he'd been shot, and says he, “Where? where? where be they? I'm ready for 'em. Give me my gun! give me my sword! Stand by, boys, I'll go ahead! Where be they?” And then he begun to rub his eyes, and looked round and see me, and says he, “Oh, John, is it you? I believe I was dreaming. I thought the enemy was jest a breaking into our camp, and I was going to send daylight through 'em about the quickest.” And then he looked out of the window, and says he, “By zounds! it's morning; come, John, call'em up, and let us have a bite of something to eat and be a going.” So I roused them all out, and we got some breakfast, and got all ready to start a little before sunrise. We found out where the governor boarded, and Sargent Johnson said he meant to give him a salute as we went by, if he wasn't up. So when we got along against the house, he give the word to fire, and we blazed away like a clap of thunder. In a minute the governor come running to the window in his shirt sleeves, and he opened the window and looked out, and says he— “That's you my brave fellers, you are the sort for me. I never shall be afraid of the British while I have sich fellow-soldiers as you are. Tell Jarvis to stick to the old line; we'll have the line of '83, come what will. And don't forget to tell Jarvis to mind and hold on to the logs.” He wished us a speedy march, and shot down the window, and we jogged along. It's no use for me to try to tell you all about the everlasting great long road we had to go over to get down here; for there's more mountains, and hills, and woods, and rivers, and ponds, and brooks, and snow-banks, and swamps, than you could shake a stick at for a month. Our disputed territory is a terribly long ways off, and there's no end to it when you get there. We didn't stop to Houlton, for our orders was to go right down into the midst of it, and report ourselves to Colonel Jarvis. So we inquired the way along and found Colonel Jarvis and his men was gone on to Fitzherbert's farm, down close to the line, and was building up a fortification. We marched along till we come clear in sight of the farm, and could see the men to work. “Now,” says Sargent Johnson, “now, my boys, is the time to show your best. See that your guns are well loaded, and march up to the camp like heroes.” We stopped and examined our guns to see if they was well loaded, and as Billy Wiggins was fumbling over his lock to see if the priming was good, some how or other he let her go; and he had a monstrous heavy charge in, and she roared away through the woods like a harrycane. At that, Sargent Johnson almost swore, and said he wished Billy Wiggins had staid at home. But he 8* told us to shoulder our guns and march up quick-step towards the camp. So we marched along, and in a minute or two we see a terrible mustering round the camp. They come out as thick as bees and begun to form into a line, and went to loading their guns as fast as they could make their hands fly. And a little, small, brisk man seemed to be taking the command, and placing the men this way and that, and making his bright sword fly about like a streak of lightning. Sargent Johnson told us to halt; for we begun to feel a little blue all to once. We didn't know but we had missed our road and got over the line, and that night be a camp of the British. So Sargent Johnson thought it was best to stop and reconnoitre a little. Bime-by we see one chap from the camp running towards the woods as hard as he could spring. “'Tis the British,” said Sargent Johnson, “'tis the British; and they are afraid of us; see how that feller runs!” But in a minute we heard the brisk little man, that had the command, bawl out after him to stop, and he swung his sword round as if he'd take his head off. The feller looked over his shoulder, but kept along. At that the commander ketcht up a gun and called again, and says he, “If you don't come right back, I'll put a ball through your heart in a minute.” That stopt the feller, and he come back again and took his place in the ranks. “There's spunk there,” said Sargent Johnson, “let 'em belong to which side of the line they will. If I knew they was British, we'd face 'em and give 'em battle at once. But I should hate to fire at 'em till we know, for fear they might belong to our side.” We was a little staggered for a while to know what was best to do. As near as we could see what they was about at the camp, they was busy to work getting ready to fight us. And as there was only eleven of us, and there seemed to be some hundreds of them, we thought it was best for us to be on the look out, and see that they didn't get the advantage of us. Sargent Johnson said he didn't see how he could have missed the road, and he couldn't hardly believe yet, but what they belonged to our side. So says he— “If there's any one of you that dares to go up with a flag of truce, I think we better send up and have a fair understanding with 'em before we begin to fight.” None of the rest of 'em started, so I told the sargent I was the boy for him to send on that are arrant. And says he— “That's you, John, I knew before I spoke, you was the man for it. So get ready.” But come to look round we couldn't find any thing to make a flag of truce of; for Sargent Johnson said it must be white, and we hadn't one of us got a white handkerchief or any sich thing; so we seemed to be kind of stuck. At last, says I, “You needn't bother about that. There's more ways to kill a cat than one.” So I tore off a good large square piece of my shirt and tied it on to the end of my gun, and says I— “Sargent, I'm ready.' After he told me what to say, I shouldered my gun and marched up towards the camp with my flag of truce flying. The camp stood up on a rising ground about a quarter of a mile from our company, and their soldiers was all out and formed in a line three or four deep. But I marched right straight up to 'em; and when I got up within a few rods, the commanding officer come along out with his sword in his hand and met me. Says I— “Who commands these troops?” “Colonel Jarvis,” says he. “I want to see him,” says I. “I'm the man,” says he. “Well, sir,” says I, “you are the very man we've been looking for all day.” “Well, sir,” says he, “I'm ready for you, let you want what you will. But is Sir John Harvey any where about here? If he is, you may go back and tell him we don't want any of his flags of truce, and no parleying about it; for we are determined to hold on to the land, every inch of it, and the logs too, if we have to die in the last ditch, and he may help himself if he can.” “But,” says I, “my dear sir, you are mistaken; we ain't Sir John Harvey's folks by a jug full. We are the Smithville detatchment, under command of Sargent Johnson, and have come down to jine your forces.” “Ah, ha!” says the colonel, “that alters the case.” So he run back and told his men how 'twas, and they set up three tremendous cheers that made the woods ring again. As soon as our company heard that, they come running up the hill like a flock of sheep, and Sargent Johnson and the colonel was so glad to see each other, that they shook hands so hard, I didn't know but they would have pulled one another's hands off. The colonel took us right into the camp and give us some dinner, and said “he was most confounded glad we'd got along, for he'd been expecting a brush with the British a number of days.” We hain't had much chance to look about here yet, but when we do, I'll write again. You needn't be consarned about our giving up any of our disputed territory, for our troops is all as fierce as tigers about it, and Colonel Jarvis, though he's a little, small, thin man, he's jest as smart as a steel-trap. Give my love to all the folks, and I remain your loving son, JOHN. Dear Gineral, my son's letter is so long, I haven't got time to add another word. Yours, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. LETTER VI. Wherein young John Smith describeth the desperate seige of the logging camp, and the memorable capture of the loggers. Smithville, Down East, in the state of Mains, March 24, 1839. Dear Gineral—I've jest got another letter from my son John, down in our disputed territory, and as I know you feel anxious to hear how they get along down there, I hasten to send you a copy of it. It is as follers: Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the Line, March, 20, 1839. Dear Father—Tell mother I ain't shot yet, though we've had one pretty considerable of a brush, and expect every day to have some more. Colonel Jarvis has took quite a liking to our little Smithville detachment. He says we are the smartest troops he's got, and as long as we stick by him, it isn't Sir John Harvey, nor all New-Brumzick, nor even Queen Victory herself can ever drive him off of Fitzherbert's farm. Perhaps you mayn't remember much about this Fitzherbert's farm, where we are. It is the very place where the British nabbed our Land Agent, Mr. McIntire, when he was abed, and asleep, and couldn't help himself, and carried him off to Frederiction jail. Let 'em come and try to nab us, if they dare; if they wouldn't wish their cake was dough again, I'm mistaken. We've got up pretty considerable of a little kind of a fort here, and we keep it manned day and night—we don't more than half of us sleep to once, and are determined the British shall never ketch us with both eyes shet. But I 'spose mother's in dreadful fidgets to know about the brush, that I mentioned in the first part of my letter, so I must make haste and get along to it. It wasn't exactly a scratch with the British soldiers, but something jest about as bad, and I don't know but a little worse, for it was along with them thieving trespassers, that's been cutting down our trees, and stealin' our logs. And I think 9 I should as lives run my chance among soldiers as among thieves. That night arter we got here, when the sentries was all placed round the fort, and the things all put up for the night, Colonel Jarvis asked us to go in and set down and have a chat. So we did; and he asked us all about our march down here to our disputed territory, and what the news was to home, and if we see the governor as we come along, and if he sent any word to him, and so on. Sargent Johnson told him all about it, and told him the governor was terrible arnest for him to hold on to the logs; and said he mustn't never flinch a hair, nor give up an inch of our disputed territory, let what would come, and he must put a stop to their cutting down our timber. Colonel Jarvis said, the governor might let him alone for that; if Sir John Harvey got hold of any of them logs, he would have to get up airlier in the morning than ever he did yet. “Now, Sargent Johnson,” said the Colonel, “you are a smart officer, and you've got a smart little company here; and bein' you've jest come into the service, it wouldn't be no more than fair that you should have a chance to take hold of some kind of a job that should be an honour to you and your company, and show to the people of the state what sort of grit you are made of. I think it's very likely there's some of them are thieving chaps about here in the woods yet, cutting down our timber; and you may take your men in the morning, and load up your guns and go off on a cruise, and see if you can ketch any of the rascals, and bring 'em and their teams off here prisoners of war; and the rest of us 'll stay here and guard the fort while you are gone. If the rascals set out to fight, don't show 'em no quarter, but take 'em, dead or alive, and bring 'em off to the fort.” Sargent Johnson told him, “that was jest sich a job as we should like, and we'd be out in the morning bright and airly and go at it.” Accordingly, as soon as it was daylight in the morning, I turned out and gave Sargent Johnson a touch, and told him 'twas time to be starting. He was on his feet as quick as a wink, and told me to call the men and tell them to get ready. In a few minutes we got our breakfasts, and put some dinner in our knapsacks, and see that our guns was all well loaded; and after the Colonel told us which way we better go, we marched off, and struck right into the woods. We had rather tough getting about, pretty much all the forenoon, scratching about through the bushes, and climbing over logs and stones, and working our way through the swamps; but towards noon we begun to come along into the timber land. And, my stars! sich great whapping pine trees, as straight as a candle, and tall as a liberty-pole, and standing all round as thick as the bean-poles in our garden, I guess you never see. “Ah,” says Sargent Johnson, “this is the place where them thieving chaps picks their huckleberries. We shall get upon the track of some of 'em bime-by!” At last we come to a pretty considerable of a kind of a little river. Sargent Johnson told us to keep a sharp look out now, for they hauled the logs into these small rivers and brooks, and in the spring, when the ice broke up, they would shoot 'em along out into the Aroostook river, and then scoot 'em away off down the St. John's river, and carry 'em off to England, and nobody knows where. We followed the river up a mile or two, and I was away a little ways ahead of the rest, and at last I heard a sharp kind of a click, like the sound of an axe chopping wood. I listened a spell, and then I heard it again; and I told Sargent Johnson we was close upon 'em, for I could hear 'em chop. At that we all stopped and listened, and we could hear 'em as plain as day. Sargent Johnson then told us to see that the primin' in our guns was all right, and to foller him as still as mice. So we crept along as careful as if we was going on eggs. Bime-by we got on to a little piece of rising ground, where we could look down towards the bend of the river, and there we see 'em as busy at work as a thief in a mill. They had a little log cabin for themselves, and another one for their oxen; and one chap was jest driving the oxen in, to give 'em some hay, and the rest was going in to dinner; all but the one that we heard chopping; and he was digging his axe into the side of a great large pine tree, as big round as a hogset. Bime-by one of 'em come to the door and hollered to him, and told him to come into dinner, for the beans was all turned out, and growin' cold. But he said the beans might go to pot for what he keered, for he wouldn't come in till he got his tree down, any how. So he kept his axe a going, click, click, and we kept still and looked on. We see 9* the tree was pretty nigh off; and bime-by we heard a crack, and then a little louder crack; and we looked up, and see the top begun to lean and tremble a little—it was a monstrous great big tree— and then the cracks come quicker and louder; crack, crack, double crack, and the old tree begun to whisk through among the tops of the other trees with a roaring sound like a harrycane, and then, in two winks of a hum-bird's eye, it went crash on to the ground like a clap of thunder, and made all smoke again. “By king,” said Sargent Johnson, “if that's the way they steal our timber, I think it's a caution.” After the tree was down, the chap stuck his axe into the stump, jest as when any body's a readin' he puts his finger on where he left off, and then he went into the camp to dinner. “Now,” says Sargent Johnson, “now's the time; while they are at dinner we'll surround the camp, and take 'em by surprise.” We looked down on to the bank of the river, and we see two or three everlastin' great piles of logs, as big as two or three houses, that they had cut, and hauled, and rolled down the bank. This made some of our company feel a little blue, for fear they might be too many for us; and they asked Sargent Johnson if we hadn't better wait till they come out of the camp, so we could see how many there was of 'em. For there was only eleven of us, and by the great pile of logs they had hauled down to the river, there might be a hundred of them. Sargent Johnson said he didn't care if there was five hundred; he'd surround their camp and take 'em prisoners. And says he, “If any of you is cowards, you may turn about and go back now, and them that stays will have the honour all to ourselves.” At that they coloured up some, and said they was no cowards, but was ready to go as fur as he would. So Sargent Johnson then give us off the plan of the campaign. And says he— “You see there is a door to the cabin, and it stands a little ways open; and you see there's holes cut out through two sides of the cabin for windows. Now we must creep as still as midnight, so that they shan't see us nor hear us, and when we've surrounded the cabin, I'll give a little bit of a low whistle, and in a moment, two of you must poke your guns right into them windows, and I'll step right into the middle of the door with my sword in one hand and my gun in 'tother, and two more of you must spring right behind me and poke your guns in over my shoulders, one over my right shoulder and 'tother over my left shoulder; and the rest of you must stand off, all ready to fire, about two rods from the camp, as a core deserve. Colonel Jarvis says it's always best to keep a core deserve, when you are goin' to make an attack. And as soon as I've got in the middle of the door, and staring of 'em right in the face, I'll sing out to 'em like thunder—`Now you rascally stealin' chaps, now I've got you; now if you don't give up in a minute, we'll shoot you down like squirrels.' And I guess that'll fetch 'em tu. If it don't, and they set out to fight, why then we must fight, that's all; and that's what we come down for.” After Sargent Johnson had given us our orders, we told him we understood 'em, and would stick to him through thick and thin. So we crawled along towards the camp as fast and as still as we could. We had to climb right over that thunderin' great big tree that they jest fell, because it was sich a bad place to get round ary end of it. But at last we got along up within three or four rods of the camp and Sargent Johnson made a sign for us to halt, so we might all get ready; and come to look round, one was missing, for there wasn't but ten of us. And come to look round to see who it was, it was Billy Wiggins. Sargent Johnson looked cross enough, and a little surprised too; for he said, for all Billy was sich a fumbling, clumsy little chap, he never thought he was a coward. At that I looked back the way we come, and I see Billy's head bobbing up and down behind that great pine tree, as he was jumping up with all his might and trying to climb up on to it. I see in a minute what the difficulty was; he couldn't get up on to the tree, and he didn't dare to holler, for that would muster 'em out of the cabin. So I run back and jumped up on to the tree and got hold of Billy's hand and hauled him over. And we pretty soon got all ready to make the attack. Every man had his gun pinted towards the cabin and all ready to pull. I and Jonathan Downing was to stand behind Sargent Johnson and pint our guns over his shoulders; and Seth Josslyn was to stand to one window and Billy Wiggins to 'tother. As soon as we was all ready, Sargent Johnson give a little, easy whistle, and we all sprung to our places; but before Sargent Johnson had time to begin to speak, Billy Wiggins's gun—I guess there must be something the matter with Billy's forefinger, for his gun blazed away like lightning into the cabin window, and his ball went splash right into a log on 'tother side. And all in the same breath the rest of our guns was all pokin' in on every side, and Sargent Johnson was bawling out to 'em with his roaring voice and calling of'em “stealin' rascals.” Oh, father! I wish you'd been there. If you ever see a flock of mice in the buttery nibbling round a pan of meal, and see the old cat jump right into the window and land right down in the middle on 'em, and see how them mice went it, you might guess a little how them prisoners of ourn jumped and sprung round and screamed. As I was looking right in over Sargent Johnson's shoulder, I could see the whole on't. There was six of 'em, and they was all setting round the table eating their dinners. They had a great large milk-pan in the middle of the table full of baked beans and three or four pounds of fat pork on the top of it; and a kettle of soup on one end of the table, and bread and potatoes and so on, all over the table. And when the thunder-clap broke upon 'em all to once, they all sprung right up as if they'd gone out of their skins; and the table went like a lock of hay in a whirlwind. It bounced up in the first place almost to the roof of the cabin; and when it came down, the beans flew from one side of the room to the other, like shot in a pepper-box; and the soup-kettle and the bread and the dishes and the potatoes I couldn't keep the run of. After the first scream was over, and they see they wasn't killed, one of 'em sprung and ketched a handspike that they had to stir the fire with, and another ketched up a stool that they had to set on, and another run behind the door and brought out an old gun. But when they see our guns pokin' in round so thick, they sprung into the corners and squat down behind the barrels, and begun to holler “don't fire! don't fire!” At last after they begun to get still a little, so he could be heard, Sargent Johnson told 'em to lay down their arms. At that, one laid down his handspike, t'other one his gun, and things begun to get considerable quiet. Then Sargent Johnson asked 'em if they was willing to surrender themselves prisoners of war. At that, one of 'em that seemed to be the head man among 'em, a short, thick, fat man, with a red face and a blueish nose, stepped forward and asked Sargent Johnson what he wanted. The sargent told him they must deliver themselves up as prisoners of war and be carried to the American camp. “And then what is to be done with us?” said he. “Well, then, you'll have to be sent to Bangor, to be tried for stealing the logs on our disputed territory,” said Sargent Johnson. “Well, then, we'll die first,” said he, and he sprung back and ketched up the gun. But when he looked round and see the rest of his men was as white as a cloth and quivering behind the barrels, and see our guns all pinted right at him, he see 'twas no use. And says he, “Captain don't fire, I'll give up.” And he brought his gun and give it to Sargent Johnson. Then Sargent Johnson ordered 'em to come out two by two, and we took and tied them together by twos, so we could guard 'em easy; and then we went to the hovel and took out the oxen. There was two yoke of oxen and a hoss; and we yoked 'em up and loaded all the provisions they had in the camp and started off for our fort. Jonathan Downing drove the oxen; and Billy Wiggins—Sargent Johnson said Billy was sich an unlucky kind of a feller he had no patience with him; but after all, he said he didn't know but what his gun goin' off so, did about as much good as any thing—so on the whole, bein' he had sich short legs, he said Billy Wiggins should ride the hoss. So when we all got ready, we marched off towards our fort, and got back jest about sunset. And as we was coming up the hill towards the fort, they all come out to meet us and give us a salute. I guess you never see a man more tickled than Colonel Jarvis was. He hopped up and down and slapped Sargent Johnson on the shoulder more than forty times; and declared if the oxen was only fat enough, we'd have one of 'em roasted whole the next day for dinner. But I can't say any more to-day; so give my love to the folks, and I remain your loving son, JOHN. 10 Dear Gineral, so much for my son John's second grist. Don't you think he grinds it out pretty well for a boy that isn't seventeen years old yet? Yours, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. LETTER VII. Wherein young John Smith describeth the bravery of the Smithville detachment in “toeing the mark,” and also their unparalleled success in capturing the British Lion. Smithville, Down East, in the state of Maine, March 30, 1839. Dear Gineral.—I've got another letter from my son John down to the boundary war; and as I 'spose you like to have 'em pretty well by your putting of 'em in your papers, I make haste to send you a copy of this by the first post. It is as follers. Our Disputed Territory pretty near the Line, on Fitzherbert's farm, March 25, 1839. Dear Father—We stick by here yet, takin' care of our disputed territory and the logs; and while we stay here the British will have to walk as straight as a hair, you may depend. We ain't had much fighting to do since my last letter; and some how or other, things seem to be getting cooler down here a little, so that I'm afraid we ain't agoing to have the real scratch, after all, that I wanted to have. A day or two arter we took the logging camp and brought the men and oxen off here prisoners of war, we was setting in the fort after dinner and talking matters over, and Sargent Johnson was a wondering what a plague was the reason the British didn't come up to the scratch as they talked on. He said he guessed they wasn't sich mighty fairce fellers for war as they pretended to be, arter all. “Well,” said Colonel Jarvis, “I got some despatches from Governor Fairfield this morning, that says Sir John Harvey seems to be a little inclined to haul in his horns; and I don't believe they'll try to drive us out of our disputed territory, or come a near us. But still the governor says we must hold on and look out sharp, for he don't know how 'twill turn out yet; and we must keep possession of the territory, and not let any body come into it, nor any logs go out of it, till we have further orders.” 10* “Well,” says Sargent Johnson, “I don't like this staying about here doing nothing; I ain't used to it. If them British are any notion of coming here and having a tug with us, I wish they'd come and have it over. Why don't we go clear to the line, colonel? How do we know but what they'll get over this side on't sometimes, if we ain't there to see to it? And besides, I want to see that boundary line, that I've heard so much tell of; and I'm determined to see it before I go home, if I have to march down to it all alone; so I can have it to tell my children of, when I get to be an old man, and can say to 'em, I have seen the boundary line myself, and marched clear down to it and stood on it.” Here I couldn't help putting in a word tu; and says I— “So do I, colonel, I want to see that are boundary line, and go right up to it, and toe the mark; I never was dared to toe the mark yet, but what I did it, let who would stand t'other side. And I should like to go right up to this line, and put my toes on to it, and look over on to the British side, and stump them to come up to it if they dared.” At that Colonel Jarvis turned round and looked at me, and haw-hawed right out; and, says he— “Well done, John, you are growing quite wolfy. I like your spunk any how; but you are young and inexperienced, and don't understand all the turns of the game exactly. You hain't seen so much war as your old great grandfather has; you must try to keep cool and foller your officers.” “But, colonel,” says I, “do you know grandfather?” “Yes, I do,” says he; “I have heard him tell his war stories many a time. Didn't he give you no good advice when you come away?” “Nothing,” says I; “only he charged me not to be in too much of a hurry to fire.” “Well,” says the colonel, “you'd better remember that advice, and foller it. And it's a pity Billy Wiggins hadn't a grandfather to advise him.” At that Billy Wiggins rolled up his little gray eyes at the colonel, and fairly looked red; and says Billy, says he— “Well, colonel, my gun goes too easy, and I can't help it. I've been a squirrel hunting with it so much, it'll almost go off itself, before you think on't.” “But this ain't what we was talking about,” said Sargent Johnson; “and I don't see as it brings us any nearer the line. As I said afore, colonel, I don't like this staying about here and doing nothing; and if things are getting cooled down a little, so as like as not we shall have to go off home pretty soon, I think the sooner we take a peep at that boundary line the better.” The colonel said, the boundary line wasn't but a few miles off, and we was as near to it now as 'twas prudent to have our head-quarters. We'd got a good strong place here on Fitzherbert's farm for a fort, and we must stick by it and keep it well manned and guarded. And he said, bein' Sargent Johnson and his company was so good on a scouting-party, and did so well t'other day when we took the logging camp, he didn't keer if we tried it again the next day. We might go out and scour round awhile, and see if we could find any more trespassers, and go down as far as the line if we'd a mind to; only be careful and not get over on t'other side of the line; for if the British nabb'd us there, we should be lawful game, and it would be hard work to make 'em give us up. So we was all alive in a minute, fitting out for a new campaign. We went to work and rubbed up our guns, and put new flints into 'em, and got 'em so they'd go as quick as a stream of lightning. And the next morning we was up by times and got our breakfasts, and filled our knapsacks, and started off. We hunted round most all the forenoon to find some more trespassers, but we couldn't find hide nor hair of a single one. We thought we must be pretty near the line, and sometimes we begun to feel a little skittish for fear we might get acrost and not know it, and the British might hop up behind some of the old logs and trees and nab us before we could have time to take aim at 'em. Bime-by Billy Wiggins started on ahead of us and run like a two-year-old, up on to a little hill there was a little ways ahead; and then he begun to climb a slim, tall pine tree, and he hitched and scrabbled up as fast as a young bear. “What upon earth,” said Sargent Johnson, “is Billy arter now?” “A squirrel, I guess,” said I; “I'll bet a potato, Billy has treed a squirrel.” When we got along up a little nearer, Sargent Johnson called out to him to know what he was doing up there. “I'm jest a looking off here to see if I can see the line,” said Billy, stretching his neck away to the eastward, and looking with all the eyes in his head. “Well, do you see it?” said Sargent Johnson. “See it? no;” said Billy, “I don't see nothing but woods, and woods, as fur as I can see.” Sargent Johnson told him he guessed he would see it quicker if he was down on the ground, than he would up there. So Billy come down again, and we jogged along. Bime-by we come to a tree that had some old marks and spots on two sides of it. And we looked along north and south of this tree, for Sargent Johnson said the line runs due north from the monument, and we found some more trees marked and spotted jest like it. “Ah,” says Sargent Johnson, “we've found it. This is the boundary line we've heard so much tell of; we've got it at last. Now look and see if you can see the British on t'other side of it; and let every man hold on to his gun and be ready to fire if I say the word.” We looked across the line, and looked and looked, but we couldn't see nothin' but trees, and bushes, and woods, and swamps. We hollered across the line as hard as we could holler, to see if we could raise any of the British, for we all felt as if we wanted to have a brush. And we thought at first they answered us; but when we come to holler again, we found it was only the echo of our own voices, that come back from the hills a little ways off. So we marched along on the line two or three miles, but we couldn't see nor hear nothin' of nobody. At last we sot down and got the victuals out of our knapsacks and eat our dinners, and rested awhile. When we got ready to start again to go back to our fort, Sargent Johnson said we should give the British one broadside before we left 'em, jest to let 'em know what the Yankee boys are made of. So he told us to see that our guns was all right; and then he ordered us to stand up all in a row, and toe the line, facing to the British side; and then he give us off the word— “Make ready, take aim—fire.” “There,” says Sargent Johnson, “now I can go home contented, war or no war; for we've poured one good grist into their own territory, and they may help themselves if they can.” Then we put on our knapsacks and shouldered our guns and started back towards the fort. We fit our way along through the bushes and swamps two or three miles, till we come out a little more into the upland, and as we was walking along and talking and telling how we guessed the British wouldn't dare to come up and toe the line as we had done, all at once we come across a great track in the snow. We stopped and looked at it awhile, but we couldn't tell what sort of a track it was. Some guessed it was a bear, and some guessed it was an ox, and some guessed it was a hoss, but they all said it didn't look like nary one on 'em. At last Billy Wiggins said, he didn't believe but what it was the British Lion got over on to our side of the boundary line. At that we all had a good laugh, and Sargent Johnson said, if that was the case we'd have a hunt for him, for no British lion had a right to set his foot in our disputed territory. So we turned off and followed the track. Bime-by we looked away ahead a little ways amongst the trees, and there we see it. 'Twas a great crittur, that looked some like an ox, only 'twas about as tall and long as a hoss; and he had a great mess of horns sprangling out both sides of his head like a great bunch of dry hemlock knots. “There,” says Billy Wiggins, “didn't I tell you it was the British lion? Don't you see his horns?” “But, tain't the lion that has horns, it's the unicorn that has horns, according to my book,” said Jonathan Downing; “and I guess it's a unicorn.” “No,” says I, “tain't a unicorn; unicorns don't have but one horn, and this feller's got a dozen.” He stood with his head up, eating the bark off the limbs of the trees. And as soon as Sargent Johnson got up so near he could have a fair sight of him, he sung out, “it's a moose—it's a moose; now we'll have some fun; now for a moose chase.” As soon as the moose see us, he jumped his whole length, and started to run. He threw his head back on his shoulders, and tipped it one side, so as to bring one bunch of his horns over his back, while 'tother bunch pinted forward, so he could run 11 between the trees and bushes; and he jumped and run like a young ox, and we arter him, as tight as we could spring. We couldn't fire at first, for we had forgot to load our guns again arter firing our broadside on the line; and Sargent Johnson said it was no matter about stopping to load, for if we could get him in a good stout snow-bank, we could take him alive. So we pulled foot arter him as hard as we could go. Some of the way the snow was pretty deep, and so hard we could run on the top of it. But the moose broke through almost every step, and he had sich hard work jumping and floundering along, he couldn't gain ahead of us hardly a bit. At last he got kind of wedged up between some high rocks on one side, and some old trees that was blowed down on 'tother side, and there he was in as bad a fix as Billy Wiggins was, behind the great pine log that I told you about in my last letter. There was no chance for the poor moose to get away, but to turn right back and make his way right through among us. He looked round at us, and shook his head a few times, and bime-by he turned round and fetched a spring and come right at us, full chisel. We sprung, some one way and some 'tother, and give him a chance to go by, and Jonathan Downing fetched him a lick acrost his nose with his gun, and broke his gun stock. But poor Billy Wiggins couldn't spring out of the way so quick as the rest of us, and the moose run right against him, and knocked him head-over-heels, as much as a rod, and the next jump he stepped on to one of Billy's legs, and broke it off as short as a pipe-stem. We run and helped Billy up, and found he wasn't hurt much, only his leg was broke; so Sargent Johnson told one of the men to stay by him, and we took arter the moose agin. Arter we chased him about half a mile further, he got into sich a deep snow-bank, it stopped him. He jumped and floundered round, but he couldn't get out, and only got deeper and deeper into it, till at last he was all covered in the snow-bank, but his head and horns, and there he stuck, pretty well tired out. We walked right up to him. His eyes looked as wild as if he'd eat us up; but he couldn't help himself. We took some strong lines that we had with us, and tied 'em to his horns, on both sides of his head, and took a slip-nuse round his nose, and trod the snow down, and got him out of the bank. We found, by trying him round a little, that we could manage him so as to lead him and drive him to the fort alive. So we sent two hands back to bring Billy Wiggins up; and they brought him along, and we took and sot him a straddle of the moose, and told him to hold on to the horns. Then Sargent Johnson took command of the ropes on one side, and I on 'tother, and each of us took a hand to help us hold on, and Jonathan Downing took hold of the line that had the slip-nuse round the nose, and went ahead to pick out the best path; and the other five went behind with sticks and whipped up. When we got all fixed, we started off and made pretty good headway. Poor Billy Wiggins begun to cry some, and said he would never get home, now his leg was broke; but Sargent Johnson comforted him up, and told him “to never mind, for if he hadn't his leg broke, he might never have had a chance to ride home to the fort in triumph on the British lion.” At that Billy laughed, and seemed to be in pretty good spirits the rest of the way. We'd got out pretty near the fort before we'd ketched the moose, and a little before sunset we got out into the opening, and was marching up the hill towards the fort. When we got pretty near, Colonel Jarvis come running to meet us, and says he, “Sargent Johnson, what sort of a prisoner have you got here?” “Why, this is the British lion,” said Sargent Johnson; “we took him this side of the line, and, therefore, he's fairly our prisoner.” “You are the boys for me,” said the Colonel; and he went back and told the men, and they give three the loudest cheers for Sargent Johnson's company that ever I heard. The Colonel had supper for us in a few minutes, and took Billy Wiggins into the hospital, and had his wounds dressed, and he bids fair to do well; and took the moose and tied him in the barn. Colonel Jarvis says we must keep him alive, and carry him home as a grand trophy of the war. P. S.—I want mother to send me down two pair of stockings and a pair of trousers, for we've got 'em torn out terribly down here among the bushes. So I remain your loving son, JOHN. Dear Gineral—Peter Smith, Esquire, Henry W. Smith, Ensign John Smith, John Smith the 11* fourth, Ichabod Smith the second, Sam Smith the third, John Smith the ninth, and old Mr. Zebedee Smith, and all his children, all wants you to send 'em your paper, beginning with the one that had my first letter in it. Your friend and subscriber, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE. LETTER VIII. Which containeth an account of the close of the war—the great rejoicings at Smithville, on the return of Sargent Johnson's company, and the getting up a public dinner in honour of the Smithville detachment. Smithville, Down East, in the State of Maine, April, 20, 1839. Dear Gineral Morris—You can't think what rejoicings there is in Smithville. The war in our disputed territory is all over; and Sargent Johnson and his company and my son John has got back, and nobody killed, and only one wounded, and that's poor Billy Wiggins, that had his leg broke by the moose that my son John told about in his last letter. The company is all as hearty as bucks, and look as well as they did when they went away, only they've got their clothes wore out pretty bad. They got along here yesterday noon. We was setting to the table and jest a finishing our dinner, and my wife was jest a saying, “Oh, dear, I wish I knew what was become of poor Johnny; we hain't heard from him for nigh about a fortnight, and I am afraid something has happened to him;” and she hadn't more than got the words out of her mouth when all to once we heard a terrible cracking and a roaring, like a platoon firing at a muster. We all jumped up and run to the door, and looked out one way and 'tother, and as soon as we looked away up to the top of the hill, we see Sargent Johnson's company jest beginning to march down; and the smoke of their guns was rolling away over their heads, where they had jest fired a salute to let the folks in the village know they was coming. As soon as we got out to the door my son John see us, and he sprung out a little one side of the company and jumped up on to a great rock, and took off his hat and swung it round and hoorah'd like a house a fire. At that my three boys next to John, they turned to, and they hoorah'd as loud as they could bawl; and then they sot out and run up the hill like young colts, and when they met the company they run up to John and tried to shake hands, but John never turned his head to the right nor to the left, but marched straight ahead like a soldier. Sargent Johnson had give 'em their orders before, not to stop for nobody nor nothin', but march straight forward with heads up, right through the village, clear to the tavern, and there he would dismiss 'em. When they got along down against our house, my wife was all of a didder, she wanted to get hold of John so. She sot out to run right to him, and called out to him, “John, oh, John, ain't you going to stop?” But Sargent Johnson shook his head at her, and called out to his company, “heads up, keep time!” and they marched right by us straight as loons. Old grandfather by this time had hobbled out to the door, and stood leaning over his staff, and when he see them march by so straight without stopping or looking one way or 'tother, says he— “Ah, that looks military. How that company has improved in discipline since they've been gone! Why, they march as well as British regulars, and seems to me John holds his head up and steps the best of any of 'em.” We stood and watched 'em till they got clear up to the tavern, and then they wasn't so fur off but what we could hear Sargent Johnson give off the word of command. “Halt; front face. Make ready; take aim; fire.” When they'd let go their broadside, Sargent Johnson made a speech to 'em, and thanked 'em for their bravery and good conduct while they'd been gone, and told 'em if ever their country was in danger again, he hoped they'd always be ready to go at a moment's warning and fight to the last drop of their blood, if it was necessary, to keep off thieves and trespassers, and all sich like. And says he— “Now, my brave feller soldiers, I bid you farewell, and take leave of you, as Gineral Washington took leave of his feller soldiers when he got through the revolutionary war. I've read it in his life, and I feel as if I wanted to cry every time I read it. Now I'll stand here, and I want you all to come round one arter another and shake hands with me, and that'll wind the business up.” And they all marched round one arter another and shook hands with Sargent Johnson, and then he told 'em they was dismissed, and would carry the thanks of their country with 'em the longest day they lived. As soon as they was dismissed, John turned and run right down towards our house full chisel. We was all out doors waiting for him, and sich a time as there was when he got there, I guess you never see. Sich a flocking round him and shaking hands, and sich a hugging among the children, it beat all nater. My wife, she couldn't help kissing him, for all he's sich a great boy, most seventeen years old. When the first hug among 'em was over, we all went into the house, and old grandfather he hobbled along and went into our house tu, for all he's so lame he hadn't been in before for nigh upon six months. My wife she flew round John like a hen that's found a lost chicken. She got hold of his arm and looked in his face, and says she— “Now, Johnny, hain't you been shot no where? Seems to me you look kind of pale and thin; I'm afraid you ain't well.” John said he never felt better in his life, and as for being shot, he hadn't come any wheres nigh it but once, and that was when they took the logging camp. “Well, John,” said old grandfather, “did you mind, my boy, what I told you, not to be in too much of a hurry to fire? Did you keep your fire back till you got up so near the enemy you could see the whites of their eyes?” “Why, as to that,” said John, “we kept our fire back till we got as fur as we could go, for we got clear to the outer line of our disputed territory and stood on it, and hollered, but there was no enemy there. We couldn't see the whites of their eyes nor nothin' else of 'em. So we let drive over into their own territory, hit or miss; and then turned about and went back to the fort.” “Well, that was well done,” said grandfather “it showed your spunk, any how; and proved that you wasn't afraid of the enemy, let him be where he would.” “Well, now John,” says I, “my son, I want to ask you one question, if there's room enough for me to get in a word edgeways. And that is, how is it you got through this war so soon down there to our disputed territory, and got along with it without any more fighting? Somehow or other, it seems to me it's cooled off dreadful quick; I don't exactly understand it.” “Nor I neither,” said John; “I don't exactly understand it myself. Some say it's all owing to Gineral Scott. They say he's been down to Augusta 12 and talked to Governor Fairfield till he got him nigh about as cool as a cowcumber. And then he writ some letters to Governor Harvey of New-brumzick, and coaxed him to let the matter drop, till the United States should have a chance to talk along with old England about it a little, and see if they couldn't settle the hash. But some say they don't think Governor Harvey would a minded what Gineral Scott said, if he hadn't heard about Sargent Johnson's company being down there so near the line, and cutting up sich shines among the loggers. And he might have heard our guns, too, when we fired over the line, and thought it was best for him to keep out of the way and be quiet. At any rate, I guess, between Gineral Scott and our company, that war is put a stop to for one while. They say Gineral Scott is a master feller to talk to folks and keep 'em from fighting; but if they will fight, they must look out, for he'll put it into 'em jist like old Gineral Jackson.” While we was talking Squire Bean come in, and said the folks over to the tavern thought it was best to get up a publick dinner for Sargent Johnson and his company, and wanted to know if I wouldn't jine 'em. I told him I was perfectly willing to, for I believed the boys deserved a good dinner as much as any set of fellers ever did. So he went back to the tavern, and they concluded to go right to work and get the dinner ready for today. Says I, “John, what a pity 'tis Gineral Scott didn't come round this way from Augusta, so as to eat this public dinner with us.” “They say he never does sich things as that," said John; “he never stops any where to eat public dinners, and never goes round to do any thing; but let his business be what 'twill and where 'twill, he always goes straight to it and does it.” “Well,” says I, “I think that's about as good a way as any, arter all.” There was considerable of a bustle over to the tavern last night and this morning, cooking and getting the dinner ready; and we let two of our gals go over and help 'em. John offered to go over and help about it, but I told him, bein' the dinner was goin' to be given in honour of him and his company, it wouldn't look well. “Why,” says he, “father, who cares for looks? looks is nothin'—behaviour's all.” I told him, as to behaviour, he stood very well on that score, but still I thought he better not go over till dinner was ready. Accordingly, to-day about twelve o'clock, they blew the horn over to the tavern, and that was the signal that the dinner was ready, and so I and John walked over. There was about fifty collected there to eat the dinner, and we all marched into the hall where the table was sot, and it was enough to du any one's eyes good to look at it. A better dinner a body couldn't hardly wish to see, even on thanksgiving day. There was biled salt beef, and pork and potatoes and cabbage, and pots of baked pork and beans, and baked Indian puddings, and fried pork and eggs, and pickled cowcumbers, and punkin pies, and fried sassages, and soused tripe, and roast spareribs, and stewed apple, and butter, and cheese, and hot bread, and cider, and I don't know what all. Squire Bean was president of the table, and he made Sargent Johnson set down at his right hand and my son John at his left, and the rest of the company along next to 'em, and we spectators sot round the rest of the table. So we all sot down and fell tu and eat as hearty as bears. Them victuals didn't stand no more chance afore us, than the British would afore Sargent Johnson and his company, if they'd a met 'em. Arter we got through eating, Squire Bean says— “Now we must have some toasts. Now bring on the jugs of cider and the tumblers.” We are most all temperance folks up here in Smithville, and don't drink much of any thing stronger than cider. So they brought on five or six gallon jugs full of cider, and a tumbler apiece for about three quarters of us, and the rest of us had mugs. Then Squire Bean says— “Now, gentlemen, please to charge for my toast.” So we poured out the cider all round, and got all ready, and then Squire Bean got up and says he— “Now, gentlemen, I give you the memory of one our feller soldiers that's been wounded in the cause of his country, and by that means prevented from jining with us on this festival occasion. I give you the memory of Billy Wiggins—a leetle apt to go off too quick, but always good spunk, and as ready to put it into the British if they don't let our 12* disputed territory alone and quit stealing our logs, as I am to pour this cider down my throat.” At that we took a drink round and then give three cheers for Billy Wiggins. And then Squire Bean says— “Now, gentlemen, please to charge for Sargent Johnson's toast.” We poured out again and got ready, and then Sargent Johnson got up, and says he— “Gentlemen, I give you the memory of Sir John Harvey. He wasn't a bit too perlite in his letter to Gineral Scott, calling of him his dear friend, and all that, for if it hadn't a been for Gineral Scott, we should a given him the most confounded licking that ever he had.” At that we begun to give three cheers for Governor Harvey, but Squire Bean sung out to us to stop, and told us not to give 'em to Governor Harvey, but to Gineral Scott. So we give three rousin' cheers for Gineral Scott. Then Squire Bean told us to please to charge for a toast from John Smith the tenth. This was my son John, setting on the left hand of the cheer. I felt a little uneasy for fear John might not get through it very well, for he never had done sich a job afore; but when we got ready, John sprung up and looked as sharp as he did that night he listed to go to the war, and says he— “Gentlemen, I give you our disputed territory; a most capital place to get pine logs, to ketch moose, and to teach the British how to toe the mark.” Then we give three cheers for the disputed territory; and Squire Bean told us to please to charge for Mr. Jonathan Downing's toast. So we poured out and got all ready again; and Jonathan Downing got up, and says he— “Gentlemen, I give you the British loggers on our disputed territory. They have to knock under, whenever the Yankees come among 'em; there's no mistake about it. But about one thing, we must give in, that they can beat us a leetle. We ain't slow at pork and beans, as we have proved at our dinner here to-day; but we must acknowledge, that them loggers sometimes make the beans fly a leetle faster than we do.” At that we hoorah'd, and give three cheers for the loggers, beans and all. There was a good many more toasts before we got through, but it's got so late I hain't got time to write 'em off before the post goes. We had a very good time, and got through about two o'clock, and cleared out for home. There wasn't nobody intoxicated, for all we dreaned the cider jugs pretty close. So I remain your old friend and subscriber, JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the Line, March the 13th, 1839. Dear Father—I take my pen in hand to let you know that I'm as hearty as a bear, and hope these few lines will find you, and mother, and grandfather, and cousin Debby, and all the children, enjoying the same blessing. We stood our march remarkable well, and are all alive, and safe, and sound as a whistle. And Sargent Johnson makes a most capital officer. He's jest sich a man as is wanted down here—there's no skeering him, I can tell you. He'd fight against bears, and wild-cats, and the British, and thunder and lightnin', and any thing else, that should set out to meddle with our disputed territory. And he's taken a master-liking to me, too, and says if he has any hard fighting to do, although I'm the youngest in the company, he shall always choose me first for his right-hand man. He says I had more pluck at the drafting than any one in the whole company, and he should rather have me by his side in battle, than any three of the rest of'em. But maybe you'd like to hear something about our march down here, and so on. For the first four or five hours, we marched rather too fast, and got pretty nigh tuckered out; for we was all so arnest to get down there before the first battle come on, that we almost run half the time. At last, about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins—you know what a short-legged little fat chunk of a thing he is—he begun to lag behind a good deal, and puffed and sweat as bad as our colt when we plough alone with him. At last, as I said afore, about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins, who had got away a good many rods behind us, stopt short in the middle of the road, and called out to Sargent Johnson as loud as he could holler, and says he, “It's no use; I can't run like a hoss all day, and without a mouthful to eat, tu. I'm half starved now, and as tired as a dog. I say, Sargent Johnson, we must stop and rest a little while, and have something to eat, or I can't keep up with you no longer, and it's no use to try.” At that Sargent Johnson ordered us to halt till Billy come up. So the poor feller come puffing along up to us, and rubbing his arm across his forehead to wipe the sweat off; and the sargent told him, bein' it was past one o'clock, we'd halt, and have some refreshments. There was a house a little ways ahead of us, and a plenty of wood piled round the door-way, that would make good seats for us to set down on; so we marched along up to it, and halted, and sot down on the wood-pile, and took off our knapsacks, and got out our victuals, and begun to eat our dinner. Presently, the old gentleman of the house looked out of the window and see us, and he opened the door, and come right out to us, without any hat on, and says he, “My boys, are you going down to fight for our disputed territory?” Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest exactly what we was up to. “That's right,” said the old gentleman, “and you look like brave fellers, too. Our company started off yesterday, and one of my boys has gone with it. I hope you'll be able to get there about as soon as they do, so that our side may be strong-handed before the first fight comes on.” Sargent Johnson told him he was determined to be there before the first battle come on, if possible, and meant to have a hand in't too. “Ah, you're the boys for me,” said the old gentleman; “if I was a few years younger, and wasn't quite so lame, I believe I should go with you. Did you ever hear any thing so impudent as 'twas for them British to carry off our land agent as they did? and then to be stealin' logs on our disputed territory—why, it makes my blood bile, when I think of it. But, come, don't set out here on the wood-pile; come, go into the house and eat your dinners, and you shall have as much of my cider as you can drink.” We thanked him, and told him we didn't keer if we did. So we went in, and had a good drink of cider with our victuals, and sot and rested ourselves nearly an hour, and then marched along again. We took it a little slower in the afternoon, so that Billy Wiggins made out to keep up with us pretty well. We got to Augusta about sunset; and jest as we was marching along by the State-house, which is a very fine building, more than as big again as our barn, and all made of hewed stone, and stands up on a little hill, pretty near the road; so, jest as we got along against the State-house, the Legislater was adjourned, and the folks was all coming out in a heap, right down towards the road. “Halt,” cried Sargent Johnson, all at once. “Left face; front, dress; rear rank close to the front: heads up.” Then he run along and whispered to us, and says he, “Now boys, we'll give 'em a solute; and I want you should do it man-fashion. Now you mind and have your guns well shouldered, and be very careful to mind the word of command, and all shoot at once. You must mind and pint your guns high, so as to go over every body's heads, for you know there's balls in 'em—and these ain't the British folks that we are going to fire at now, remember that. I shall give the word of command, make ready, take aim, fire—and when you hear the word fire, you must pull trigger all at once, and blaze away like thunder.” We all told him we would, and he went along and took his stand at the head of the company. We'd all kept our guns well loaded during the day, for fear what might happen, and we shouldered 'em as the sargent told us, and got all fixed, and stood with stiff upper lips, and all ready to fire. Jest as the main body of the legislater-folks and the people got along down within about two rods of the road where we stood, Sargent Johnson hollered out, with a good loud military voice, “Make ready—” Crack! went Billy Wiggins' gun—smoke, powder, wad, and every thing blazing into the air. I never see any body so struck up as Sargent Johnson was—he coloured as red as a blaze, and looked as if he would a bit Billy Wiggins' head off. But when he see the rest of us held on, and didn't pull, he plucked up courage again, and give the rest of the word of command. “Take aim—Fire—” In a moment we all pulled, pretty near together, tu, and if we didn't give 'em a real stunder, I won't guess again. Some of the people jumped, and some squat like geese going into a barn door. But when they found nobody wasn't killed, they come along down to the road, and inquired of Sargent Johnson what town we come from, and shook hands with us, and seemed to be very glad to see us, and said they was glad we'd got along; for things looked terrible squally down to our disputed territory, and the sooner we could get there the better. Bime-by Governor Fairfield come out of the State-house, and come along down to the road, and says he, “My brave fellow-soldiers, I'm glad to see you, what town do you come from?” Sargent Johnson told him we was the Smithville detachment, and was on our way down to our disputed territory, and if he had any commands to send that way, we should be happy to carry 'em. The governor's a little piece of a man to look at; but they say he's got grit enough aboard for two 8 common sized men. He said he had no particular commands to send by us, only he wanted us to get down there as quick as we possibly could, and report ourselves to Colonel Jarvis, and he would take command of us, and tell us what to do. And, says he, “I want you to tell Jarvis to hold on down there like a dog to a root, and not give up an inch to them British chaps; if he wants more men, only send word to me, and he shall have 'em by regiments, as many as he wants. But tell him never to give up an inch; if Sir John Harvey frets—let him fret. But above all, tell Jarvis to hold on to the logs, live or die. And now my brave fellers,” said the governor, “it's too late for you to go any further to-night; you shall have a chance to sleep in one of the lobbies of the State-house, and I'll see that you have victuals and drink provided for you; and I want you to be under way again by sunrise in the morning, whether I am up or not.” So we bid the governor good night, and he sent a man to show us the way into the State-house, and to bring us what we wanted to eat and drink. And we fared well, too, I can tell you—a plenty of bread and meat, and hot coffee, and a basket of apples. We helped ourselves you may depend, as though we hadn't had any thing to eat for a month. The legislater-folks come back in crowds and flocked round the door, and a great many of 'em come in and talked with us about the war down in our disputed territory. They all said the land was ourn, every inch of it, and we must stick to it, and not give up a single tree; for the legislater was determined to stand by us, and would vote to pay all the expenses. After they'd all cleared out, we laid down and took a nap. And about an hour before sunrise I got up and looked out, and see 'twas all broad daylight; so I went and touched Sargent Johnson, and told him 'twas time to be stirring. He sprung on his feet quicker than if he'd been shot, and says he, “Where? where? where be they? I'm ready for 'em. Give me my gun! give me my sword! Stand by, boys, I'll go ahead! Where be they?” And then he begun to rub his eyes, and looked round and see me, and says he, “Oh, John, is it you? I believe I was dreaming. I thought the enemy was jest a breaking into our camp, and I was going to send daylight through 'em about the quickest.” And then he looked out of the window, and says he, “By zounds! it's morning; come, John, call'em up, and let us have a bite of something to eat and be a going.” So I roused them all out, and we got some breakfast, and got all ready to start a little before sunrise. We found out where the governor boarded, and Sargent Johnson said he meant to give him a salute as we went by, if he wasn't up. So when we got along against the house, he give the word to fire, and we blazed away like a clap of thunder. In a minute the governor come running to the window in his shirt sleeves, and he opened the window and looked out, and says he— “That's you my brave fellers, you are the sort for me. I never shall be afraid of the British while I have sich fellow-soldiers as you are. Tell Jarvis to stick to the old line; we'll have the line of '83, come what will. And don't forget to tell Jarvis to mind and hold on to the logs.” He wished us a speedy march, and shot down the window, and we jogged along. It's no use for me to try to tell you all about the everlasting great long road we had to go over to get down here; for there's more mountains, and hills, and woods, and rivers, and ponds, and brooks, and snow-banks, and swamps, than you could shake a stick at for a month. Our disputed territory is a terribly long ways off, and there's no end to it when you get there. We didn't stop to Houlton, for our orders was to go right down into the midst of it, and report ourselves to Colonel Jarvis. So we inquired the way along and found Colonel Jarvis and his men was gone on to Fitzherbert's farm, down close to the line, and was building up a fortification. We marched along till we come clear in sight of the farm, and could see the men to work. “Now,” says Sargent Johnson, “now, my boys, is the time to show your best. See that your guns are well loaded, and march up to the camp like heroes.” We stopped and examined our guns to see if they was well loaded, and as Billy Wiggins was fumbling over his lock to see if the priming was good, some how or other he let her go; and he had a monstrous heavy charge in, and she roared away through the woods like a harrycane. At that, Sargent Johnson almost swore, and said he wished Billy Wiggins had staid at home. But he 8* told us to shoulder our guns and march up quick-step towards the camp. So we marched along, and in a minute or two we see a terrible mustering round the camp. They come out as thick as bees and begun to form into a line, and went to loading their guns as fast as they could make their hands fly. And a little, small, brisk man seemed to be taking the command, and placing the men this way and that, and making his bright sword fly about like a streak of lightning. Sargent Johnson told us to halt; for we begun to feel a little blue all to once. We didn't know but we had missed our road and got over the line, and that night be a camp of the British. So Sargent Johnson thought it was best to stop and reconnoitre a little. Bime-by we see one chap from the camp running towards the woods as hard as he could spring. “'Tis the British,” said Sargent Johnson, “'tis the British; and they are afraid of us; see how that feller runs!” But in a minute we heard the brisk little man, that had the command, bawl out after him to stop, and he swung his sword round as if he'd take his head off. The feller looked over his shoulder, but kept along. At that the commander ketcht up a gun and called again, and says he, “If you don't come right back, I'll put a ball through your heart in a minute.” That stopt the feller, and he come back again and took his place in the ranks. “There's spunk there,” said Sargent Johnson, “let 'em belong to which side of the line they will. If I knew they was British, we'd face 'em and give 'em battle at once. But I should hate to fire at 'em till we know, for fear they might belong to our side.” We was a little staggered for a while to know what was best to do. As near as we could see what they was about at the camp, they was busy to work getting ready to fight us. And as there was only eleven of us, and there seemed to be some hundreds of them, we thought it was best for us to be on the look out, and see that they didn't get the advantage of us. Sargent Johnson said he didn't see how he could have missed the road, and he couldn't hardly believe yet, but what they belonged to our side. So says he— “If there's any one of you that dares to go up with a flag of truce, I think we better send up and have a fair understanding with 'em before we begin to fight.” None of the rest of 'em started, so I told the sargent I was the boy for him to send on that are arrant. And says he— “That's you, John, I knew before I spoke, you was the man for it. So get ready.” But come to look round we couldn't find any thing to make a flag of truce of; for Sargent Johnson said it must be white, and we hadn't one of us got a white handkerchief or any sich thing; so we seemed to be kind of stuck. At last, says I, “You needn't bother about that. There's more ways to kill a cat than one.” So I tore off a good large square piece of my shirt and tied it on to the end of my gun, and says I— “Sargent, I'm ready.' After he told me what to say, I shouldered my gun and marched up towards the camp with my flag of truce flying. The camp stood up on a rising ground about a quarter of a mile from our company, and their soldiers was all out and formed in a line three or four deep. But I marched right straight up to 'em; and when I got up within a few rods, the commanding officer come along out with his sword in his hand and met me. Says I— “Who commands these troops?” “Colonel Jarvis,” says he. “I want to see him,” says I. “I'm the man,” says he. “Well, sir,” says I, “you are the very man we've been looking for all day.” “Well, sir,” says he, “I'm ready for you, let you want what you will. But is Sir John Harvey any where about here? If he is, you may go back and tell him we don't want any of his flags of truce, and no parleying about it; for we are determined to hold on to the land, every inch of it, and the logs too, if we have to die in the last ditch, and he may help himself if he can.” “But,” says I, “my dear sir, you are mistaken; we ain't Sir John Harvey's folks by a jug full. We are the Smithville detatchment, under command of Sargent Johnson, and have come down to jine your forces.” “Ah, ha!” says the colonel, “that alters the case.” So he run back and told his men how 'twas, and they set up three tremendous cheers that made the woods ring again. As soon as our company heard that, they come running up the hill like a flock of sheep, and Sargent Johnson and the colonel was so glad to see each other, that they shook hands so hard, I didn't know but they would have pulled one another's hands off. The colonel took us right into the camp and give us some dinner, and said “he was most confounded glad we'd got along, for he'd been expecting a brush with the British a number of days.” We hain't had much chance to look about here yet, but when we do, I'll write again. You needn't be consarned about our giving up any of our disputed territory, for our troops is all as fierce as tigers about it, and Colonel Jarvis, though he's a little, small, thin man, he's jest as smart as a steel-trap. Give my love to all the folks, and I remain your loving son, JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the Line, March, 20, 1839. Dear Father—Tell mother I ain't shot yet, though we've had one pretty considerable of a brush, and expect every day to have some more. Colonel Jarvis has took quite a liking to our little Smithville detachment. He says we are the smartest troops he's got, and as long as we stick by him, it isn't Sir John Harvey, nor all New-Brumzick, nor even Queen Victory herself can ever drive him off of Fitzherbert's farm. Perhaps you mayn't remember much about this Fitzherbert's farm, where we are. It is the very place where the British nabbed our Land Agent, Mr. McIntire, when he was abed, and asleep, and couldn't help himself, and carried him off to Frederiction jail. Let 'em come and try to nab us, if they dare; if they wouldn't wish their cake was dough again, I'm mistaken. We've got up pretty considerable of a little kind of a fort here, and we keep it manned day and night—we don't more than half of us sleep to once, and are determined the British shall never ketch us with both eyes shet. But I 'spose mother's in dreadful fidgets to know about the brush, that I mentioned in the first part of my letter, so I must make haste and get along to it. It wasn't exactly a scratch with the British soldiers, but something jest about as bad, and I don't know but a little worse, for it was along with them thieving trespassers, that's been cutting down our trees, and stealin' our logs. And I think 9 I should as lives run my chance among soldiers as among thieves. That night arter we got here, when the sentries was all placed round the fort, and the things all put up for the night, Colonel Jarvis asked us to go in and set down and have a chat. So we did; and he asked us all about our march down here to our disputed territory, and what the news was to home, and if we see the governor as we come along, and if he sent any word to him, and so on. Sargent Johnson told him all about it, and told him the governor was terrible arnest for him to hold on to the logs; and said he mustn't never flinch a hair, nor give up an inch of our disputed territory, let what would come, and he must put a stop to their cutting down our timber. Colonel Jarvis said, the governor might let him alone for that; if Sir John Harvey got hold of any of them logs, he would have to get up airlier in the morning than ever he did yet. “Now, Sargent Johnson,” said the Colonel, “you are a smart officer, and you've got a smart little company here; and bein' you've jest come into the service, it wouldn't be no more than fair that you should have a chance to take hold of some kind of a job that should be an honour to you and your company, and show to the people of the state what sort of grit you are made of. I think it's very likely there's some of them are thieving chaps about here in the woods yet, cutting down our timber; and you may take your men in the morning, and load up your guns and go off on a cruise, and see if you can ketch any of the rascals, and bring 'em and their teams off here prisoners of war; and the rest of us 'll stay here and guard the fort while you are gone. If the rascals set out to fight, don't show 'em no quarter, but take 'em, dead or alive, and bring 'em off to the fort.” Sargent Johnson told him, “that was jest sich a job as we should like, and we'd be out in the morning bright and airly and go at it.” Accordingly, as soon as it was daylight in the morning, I turned out and gave Sargent Johnson a touch, and told him 'twas time to be starting. He was on his feet as quick as a wink, and told me to call the men and tell them to get ready. In a few minutes we got our breakfasts, and put some dinner in our knapsacks, and see that our guns was all well loaded; and after the Colonel told us which way we better go, we marched off, and struck right into the woods. We had rather tough getting about, pretty much all the forenoon, scratching about through the bushes, and climbing over logs and stones, and working our way through the swamps; but towards noon we begun to come along into the timber land. And, my stars! sich great whapping pine trees, as straight as a candle, and tall as a liberty-pole, and standing all round as thick as the bean-poles in our garden, I guess you never see. “Ah,” says Sargent Johnson, “this is the place where them thieving chaps picks their huckleberries. We shall get upon the track of some of 'em bime-by!” At last we come to a pretty considerable of a kind of a little river. Sargent Johnson told us to keep a sharp look out now, for they hauled the logs into these small rivers and brooks, and in the spring, when the ice broke up, they would shoot 'em along out into the Aroostook river, and then scoot 'em away off down the St. John's river, and carry 'em off to England, and nobody knows where. We followed the river up a mile or two, and I was away a little ways ahead of the rest, and at last I heard a sharp kind of a click, like the sound of an axe chopping wood. I listened a spell, and then I heard it again; and I told Sargent Johnson we was close upon 'em, for I could hear 'em chop. At that we all stopped and listened, and we could hear 'em as plain as day. Sargent Johnson then told us to see that the primin' in our guns was all right, and to foller him as still as mice. So we crept along as careful as if we was going on eggs. Bime-by we got on to a little piece of rising ground, where we could look down towards the bend of the river, and there we see 'em as busy at work as a thief in a mill. They had a little log cabin for themselves, and another one for their oxen; and one chap was jest driving the oxen in, to give 'em some hay, and the rest was going in to dinner; all but the one that we heard chopping; and he was digging his axe into the side of a great large pine tree, as big round as a hogset. Bime-by one of 'em come to the door and hollered to him, and told him to come into dinner, for the beans was all turned out, and growin' cold. But he said the beans might go to pot for what he keered, for he wouldn't come in till he got his tree down, any how. So he kept his axe a going, click, click, and we kept still and looked on. We see 9* the tree was pretty nigh off; and bime-by we heard a crack, and then a little louder crack; and we looked up, and see the top begun to lean and tremble a little—it was a monstrous great big tree— and then the cracks come quicker and louder; crack, crack, double crack, and the old tree begun to whisk through among the tops of the other trees with a roaring sound like a harrycane, and then, in two winks of a hum-bird's eye, it went crash on to the ground like a clap of thunder, and made all smoke again. “By king,” said Sargent Johnson, “if that's the way they steal our timber, I think it's a caution.” After the tree was down, the chap stuck his axe into the stump, jest as when any body's a readin' he puts his finger on where he left off, and then he went into the camp to dinner. “Now,” says Sargent Johnson, “now's the time; while they are at dinner we'll surround the camp, and take 'em by surprise.” We looked down on to the bank of the river, and we see two or three everlastin' great piles of logs, as big as two or three houses, that they had cut, and hauled, and rolled down the bank. This made some of our company feel a little blue, for fear they might be too many for us; and they asked Sargent Johnson if we hadn't better wait till they come out of the camp, so we could see how many there was of 'em. For there was only eleven of us, and by the great pile of logs they had hauled down to the river, there might be a hundred of them. Sargent Johnson said he didn't care if there was five hundred; he'd surround their camp and take 'em prisoners. And says he, “If any of you is cowards, you may turn about and go back now, and them that stays will have the honour all to ourselves.” At that they coloured up some, and said they was no cowards, but was ready to go as fur as he would. So Sargent Johnson then give us off the plan of the campaign. And says he— “You see there is a door to the cabin, and it stands a little ways open; and you see there's holes cut out through two sides of the cabin for windows. Now we must creep as still as midnight, so that they shan't see us nor hear us, and when we've surrounded the cabin, I'll give a little bit of a low whistle, and in a moment, two of you must poke your guns right into them windows, and I'll step right into the middle of the door with my sword in one hand and my gun in 'tother, and two more of you must spring right behind me and poke your guns in over my shoulders, one over my right shoulder and 'tother over my left shoulder; and the rest of you must stand off, all ready to fire, about two rods from the camp, as a core deserve. Colonel Jarvis says it's always best to keep a core deserve, when you are goin' to make an attack. And as soon as I've got in the middle of the door, and staring of 'em right in the face, I'll sing out to 'em like thunder—`Now you rascally stealin' chaps, now I've got you; now if you don't give up in a minute, we'll shoot you down like squirrels.' And I guess that'll fetch 'em tu. If it don't, and they set out to fight, why then we must fight, that's all; and that's what we come down for.” After Sargent Johnson had given us our orders, we told him we understood 'em, and would stick to him through thick and thin. So we crawled along towards the camp as fast and as still as we could. We had to climb right over that thunderin' great big tree that they jest fell, because it was sich a bad place to get round ary end of it. But at last we got along up within three or four rods of the camp and Sargent Johnson made a sign for us to halt, so we might all get ready; and come to look round, one was missing, for there wasn't but ten of us. And come to look round to see who it was, it was Billy Wiggins. Sargent Johnson looked cross enough, and a little surprised too; for he said, for all Billy was sich a fumbling, clumsy little chap, he never thought he was a coward. At that I looked back the way we come, and I see Billy's head bobbing up and down behind that great pine tree, as he was jumping up with all his might and trying to climb up on to it. I see in a minute what the difficulty was; he couldn't get up on to the tree, and he didn't dare to holler, for that would muster 'em out of the cabin. So I run back and jumped up on to the tree and got hold of Billy's hand and hauled him over. And we pretty soon got all ready to make the attack. Every man had his gun pinted towards the cabin and all ready to pull. I and Jonathan Downing was to stand behind Sargent Johnson and pint our guns over his shoulders; and Seth Josslyn was to stand to one window and Billy Wiggins to 'tother. As soon as we was all ready, Sargent Johnson give a little, easy whistle, and we all sprung to our places; but before Sargent Johnson had time to begin to speak, Billy Wiggins's gun—I guess there must be something the matter with Billy's forefinger, for his gun blazed away like lightning into the cabin window, and his ball went splash right into a log on 'tother side. And all in the same breath the rest of our guns was all pokin' in on every side, and Sargent Johnson was bawling out to 'em with his roaring voice and calling of'em “stealin' rascals.” Oh, father! I wish you'd been there. If you ever see a flock of mice in the buttery nibbling round a pan of meal, and see the old cat jump right into the window and land right down in the middle on 'em, and see how them mice went it, you might guess a little how them prisoners of ourn jumped and sprung round and screamed. As I was looking right in over Sargent Johnson's shoulder, I could see the whole on't. There was six of 'em, and they was all setting round the table eating their dinners. They had a great large milk-pan in the middle of the table full of baked beans and three or four pounds of fat pork on the top of it; and a kettle of soup on one end of the table, and bread and potatoes and so on, all over the table. And when the thunder-clap broke upon 'em all to once, they all sprung right up as if they'd gone out of their skins; and the table went like a lock of hay in a whirlwind. It bounced up in the first place almost to the roof of the cabin; and when it came down, the beans flew from one side of the room to the other, like shot in a pepper-box; and the soup-kettle and the bread and the dishes and the potatoes I couldn't keep the run of. After the first scream was over, and they see they wasn't killed, one of 'em sprung and ketched a handspike that they had to stir the fire with, and another ketched up a stool that they had to set on, and another run behind the door and brought out an old gun. But when they see our guns pokin' in round so thick, they sprung into the corners and squat down behind the barrels, and begun to holler “don't fire! don't fire!” At last after they begun to get still a little, so he could be heard, Sargent Johnson told 'em to lay down their arms. At that, one laid down his handspike, t'other one his gun, and things begun to get considerable quiet. Then Sargent Johnson asked 'em if they was willing to surrender themselves prisoners of war. At that, one of 'em that seemed to be the head man among 'em, a short, thick, fat man, with a red face and a blueish nose, stepped forward and asked Sargent Johnson what he wanted. The sargent told him they must deliver themselves up as prisoners of war and be carried to the American camp. “And then what is to be done with us?” said he. “Well, then, you'll have to be sent to Bangor, to be tried for stealing the logs on our disputed territory,” said Sargent Johnson. “Well, then, we'll die first,” said he, and he sprung back and ketched up the gun. But when he looked round and see the rest of his men was as white as a cloth and quivering behind the barrels, and see our guns all pinted right at him, he see 'twas no use. And says he, “Captain don't fire, I'll give up.” And he brought his gun and give it to Sargent Johnson. Then Sargent Johnson ordered 'em to come out two by two, and we took and tied them together by twos, so we could guard 'em easy; and then we went to the hovel and took out the oxen. There was two yoke of oxen and a hoss; and we yoked 'em up and loaded all the provisions they had in the camp and started off for our fort. Jonathan Downing drove the oxen; and Billy Wiggins—Sargent Johnson said Billy was sich an unlucky kind of a feller he had no patience with him; but after all, he said he didn't know but what his gun goin' off so, did about as much good as any thing—so on the whole, bein' he had sich short legs, he said Billy Wiggins should ride the hoss. So when we all got ready, we marched off towards our fort, and got back jest about sunset. And as we was coming up the hill towards the fort, they all come out to meet us and give us a salute. I guess you never see a man more tickled than Colonel Jarvis was. He hopped up and down and slapped Sargent Johnson on the shoulder more than forty times; and declared if the oxen was only fat enough, we'd have one of 'em roasted whole the next day for dinner. But I can't say any more to-day; so give my love to the folks, and I remain your loving son, JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Disputed Territory pretty near the Line, on Fitzherbert's farm, March 25, 1839. Dear Father—We stick by here yet, takin' care of our disputed territory and the logs; and while we stay here the British will have to walk as straight as a hair, you may depend. We ain't had much fighting to do since my last letter; and some how or other, things seem to be getting cooler down here a little, so that I'm afraid we ain't agoing to have the real scratch, after all, that I wanted to have. A day or two arter we took the logging camp and brought the men and oxen off here prisoners of war, we was setting in the fort after dinner and talking matters over, and Sargent Johnson was a wondering what a plague was the reason the British didn't come up to the scratch as they talked on. He said he guessed they wasn't sich mighty fairce fellers for war as they pretended to be, arter all. “Well,” said Colonel Jarvis, “I got some despatches from Governor Fairfield this morning, that says Sir John Harvey seems to be a little inclined to haul in his horns; and I don't believe they'll try to drive us out of our disputed territory, or come a near us. But still the governor says we must hold on and look out sharp, for he don't know how 'twill turn out yet; and we must keep possession of the territory, and not let any body come into it, nor any logs go out of it, till we have further orders.” 10* “Well,” says Sargent Johnson, “I don't like this staying about here doing nothing; I ain't used to it. If them British are any notion of coming here and having a tug with us, I wish they'd come and have it over. Why don't we go clear to the line, colonel? How do we know but what they'll get over this side on't sometimes, if we ain't there to see to it? And besides, I want to see that boundary line, that I've heard so much tell of; and I'm determined to see it before I go home, if I have to march down to it all alone; so I can have it to tell my children of, when I get to be an old man, and can say to 'em, I have seen the boundary line myself, and marched clear down to it and stood on it.” Here I couldn't help putting in a word tu; and says I— “So do I, colonel, I want to see that are boundary line, and go right up to it, and toe the mark; I never was dared to toe the mark yet, but what I did it, let who would stand t'other side. And I should like to go right up to this line, and put my toes on to it, and look over on to the British side, and stump them to come up to it if they dared.” At that Colonel Jarvis turned round and looked at me, and haw-hawed right out; and, says he— “Well done, John, you are growing quite wolfy. I like your spunk any how; but you are young and inexperienced, and don't understand all the turns of the game exactly. You hain't seen so much war as your old great grandfather has; you must try to keep cool and foller your officers.” “But, colonel,” says I, “do you know grandfather?” “Yes, I do,” says he; “I have heard him tell his war stories many a time. Didn't he give you no good advice when you come away?” “Nothing,” says I; “only he charged me not to be in too much of a hurry to fire.” “Well,” says the colonel, “you'd better remember that advice, and foller it. And it's a pity Billy Wiggins hadn't a grandfather to advise him.” At that Billy Wiggins rolled up his little gray eyes at the colonel, and fairly looked red; and says Billy, says he— “Well, colonel, my gun goes too easy, and I can't help it. I've been a squirrel hunting with it so much, it'll almost go off itself, before you think on't.” “But this ain't what we was talking about,” said Sargent Johnson; “and I don't see as it brings us any nearer the line. As I said afore, colonel, I don't like this staying about here and doing nothing; and if things are getting cooled down a little, so as like as not we shall have to go off home pretty soon, I think the sooner we take a peep at that boundary line the better.” The colonel said, the boundary line wasn't but a few miles off, and we was as near to it now as 'twas prudent to have our head-quarters. We'd got a good strong place here on Fitzherbert's farm for a fort, and we must stick by it and keep it well manned and guarded. And he said, bein' Sargent Johnson and his company was so good on a scouting-party, and did so well t'other day when we took the logging camp, he didn't keer if we tried it again the next day. We might go out and scour round awhile, and see if we could find any more trespassers, and go down as far as the line if we'd a mind to; only be careful and not get over on t'other side of the line; for if the British nabb'd us there, we should be lawful game, and it would be hard work to make 'em give us up. So we was all alive in a minute, fitting out for a new campaign. We went to work and rubbed up our guns, and put new flints into 'em, and got 'em so they'd go as quick as a stream of lightning. And the next morning we was up by times and got our breakfasts, and filled our knapsacks, and started off. We hunted round most all the forenoon to find some more trespassers, but we couldn't find hide nor hair of a single one. We thought we must be pretty near the line, and sometimes we begun to feel a little skittish for fear we might get acrost and not know it, and the British might hop up behind some of the old logs and trees and nab us before we could have time to take aim at 'em. Bime-by Billy Wiggins started on ahead of us and run like a two-year-old, up on to a little hill there was a little ways ahead; and then he begun to climb a slim, tall pine tree, and he hitched and scrabbled up as fast as a young bear. “What upon earth,” said Sargent Johnson, “is Billy arter now?” “A squirrel, I guess,” said I; “I'll bet a potato, Billy has treed a squirrel.” When we got along up a little nearer, Sargent Johnson called out to him to know what he was doing up there. “I'm jest a looking off here to see if I can see the line,” said Billy, stretching his neck away to the eastward, and looking with all the eyes in his head. “Well, do you see it?” said Sargent Johnson. “See it? no;” said Billy, “I don't see nothing but woods, and woods, as fur as I can see.” Sargent Johnson told him he guessed he would see it quicker if he was down on the ground, than he would up there. So Billy come down again, and we jogged along. Bime-by we come to a tree that had some old marks and spots on two sides of it. And we looked along north and south of this tree, for Sargent Johnson said the line runs due north from the monument, and we found some more trees marked and spotted jest like it. “Ah,” says Sargent Johnson, “we've found it. This is the boundary line we've heard so much tell of; we've got it at last. Now look and see if you can see the British on t'other side of it; and let every man hold on to his gun and be ready to fire if I say the word.” We looked across the line, and looked and looked, but we couldn't see nothin' but trees, and bushes, and woods, and swamps. We hollered across the line as hard as we could holler, to see if we could raise any of the British, for we all felt as if we wanted to have a brush. And we thought at first they answered us; but when we come to holler again, we found it was only the echo of our own voices, that come back from the hills a little ways off. So we marched along on the line two or three miles, but we couldn't see nor hear nothin' of nobody. At last we sot down and got the victuals out of our knapsacks and eat our dinners, and rested awhile. When we got ready to start again to go back to our fort, Sargent Johnson said we should give the British one broadside before we left 'em, jest to let 'em know what the Yankee boys are made of. So he told us to see that our guns was all right; and then he ordered us to stand up all in a row, and toe the line, facing to the British side; and then he give us off the word— “Make ready, take aim—fire.” “There,” says Sargent Johnson, “now I can go home contented, war or no war; for we've poured one good grist into their own territory, and they may help themselves if they can.” Then we put on our knapsacks and shouldered our guns and started back towards the fort. We fit our way along through the bushes and swamps two or three miles, till we come out a little more into the upland, and as we was walking along and talking and telling how we guessed the British wouldn't dare to come up and toe the line as we had done, all at once we come across a great track in the snow. We stopped and looked at it awhile, but we couldn't tell what sort of a track it was. Some guessed it was a bear, and some guessed it was an ox, and some guessed it was a hoss, but they all said it didn't look like nary one on 'em. At last Billy Wiggins said, he didn't believe but what it was the British Lion got over on to our side of the boundary line. At that we all had a good laugh, and Sargent Johnson said, if that was the case we'd have a hunt for him, for no British lion had a right to set his foot in our disputed territory. So we turned off and followed the track. Bime-by we looked away ahead a little ways amongst the trees, and there we see it. 'Twas a great crittur, that looked some like an ox, only 'twas about as tall and long as a hoss; and he had a great mess of horns sprangling out both sides of his head like a great bunch of dry hemlock knots. “There,” says Billy Wiggins, “didn't I tell you it was the British lion? Don't you see his horns?” “But, tain't the lion that has horns, it's the unicorn that has horns, according to my book,” said Jonathan Downing; “and I guess it's a unicorn.” “No,” says I, “tain't a unicorn; unicorns don't have but one horn, and this feller's got a dozen.” He stood with his head up, eating the bark off the limbs of the trees. And as soon as Sargent Johnson got up so near he could have a fair sight of him, he sung out, “it's a moose—it's a moose; now we'll have some fun; now for a moose chase.” As soon as the moose see us, he jumped his whole length, and started to run. He threw his head back on his shoulders, and tipped it one side, so as to bring one bunch of his horns over his back, while 'tother bunch pinted forward, so he could run 11 between the trees and bushes; and he jumped and run like a young ox, and we arter him, as tight as we could spring. We couldn't fire at first, for we had forgot to load our guns again arter firing our broadside on the line; and Sargent Johnson said it was no matter about stopping to load, for if we could get him in a good stout snow-bank, we could take him alive. So we pulled foot arter him as hard as we could go. Some of the way the snow was pretty deep, and so hard we could run on the top of it. But the moose broke through almost every step, and he had sich hard work jumping and floundering along, he couldn't gain ahead of us hardly a bit. At last he got kind of wedged up between some high rocks on one side, and some old trees that was blowed down on 'tother side, and there he was in as bad a fix as Billy Wiggins was, behind the great pine log that I told you about in my last letter. There was no chance for the poor moose to get away, but to turn right back and make his way right through among us. He looked round at us, and shook his head a few times, and bime-by he turned round and fetched a spring and come right at us, full chisel. We sprung, some one way and some 'tother, and give him a chance to go by, and Jonathan Downing fetched him a lick acrost his nose with his gun, and broke his gun stock. But poor Billy Wiggins couldn't spring out of the way so quick as the rest of us, and the moose run right against him, and knocked him head-over-heels, as much as a rod, and the next jump he stepped on to one of Billy's legs, and broke it off as short as a pipe-stem. We run and helped Billy up, and found he wasn't hurt much, only his leg was broke; so Sargent Johnson told one of the men to stay by him, and we took arter the moose agin. Arter we chased him about half a mile further, he got into sich a deep snow-bank, it stopped him. He jumped and floundered round, but he couldn't get out, and only got deeper and deeper into it, till at last he was all covered in the snow-bank, but his head and horns, and there he stuck, pretty well tired out. We walked right up to him. His eyes looked as wild as if he'd eat us up; but he couldn't help himself. We took some strong lines that we had with us, and tied 'em to his horns, on both sides of his head, and took a slip-nuse round his nose, and trod the snow down, and got him out of the bank. We found, by trying him round a little, that we could manage him so as to lead him and drive him to the fort alive. So we sent two hands back to bring Billy Wiggins up; and they brought him along, and we took and sot him a straddle of the moose, and told him to hold on to the horns. Then Sargent Johnson took command of the ropes on one side, and I on 'tother, and each of us took a hand to help us hold on, and Jonathan Downing took hold of the line that had the slip-nuse round the nose, and went ahead to pick out the best path; and the other five went behind with sticks and whipped up. When we got all fixed, we started off and made pretty good headway. Poor Billy Wiggins begun to cry some, and said he would never get home, now his leg was broke; but Sargent Johnson comforted him up, and told him “to never mind, for if he hadn't his leg broke, he might never have had a chance to ride home to the fort in triumph on the British lion.” At that Billy laughed, and seemed to be in pretty good spirits the rest of the way. We'd got out pretty near the fort before we'd ketched the moose, and a little before sunset we got out into the opening, and was marching up the hill towards the fort. When we got pretty near, Colonel Jarvis come running to meet us, and says he, “Sargent Johnson, what sort of a prisoner have you got here?” “Why, this is the British lion,” said Sargent Johnson; “we took him this side of the line, and, therefore, he's fairly our prisoner.” “You are the boys for me,” said the Colonel; and he went back and told the men, and they give three the loudest cheers for Sargent Johnson's company that ever I heard. The Colonel had supper for us in a few minutes, and took Billy Wiggins into the hospital, and had his wounds dressed, and he bids fair to do well; and took the moose and tied him in the barn. Colonel Jarvis says we must keep him alive, and carry him home as a grand trophy of the war. P. S.—I want mother to send me down two pair of stockings and a pair of trousers, for we've got 'em torn out terribly down here among the bushes. So I remain your loving son, JOHN.</field>
