      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. B REDWOOD. CHAPTER XVIII. “Il y a dans l'aspect de la contrée quelque chose de calme et de doux qui prépare l'âme à sortir des agitations de la vie.” Madame de Stael. It was a fine afternoon in the month of August when our travellers passed the romantic road which traverses the mountain that forms the eastern boundary of the valley of Hancock. The varied pleasures they had enjoyed during the day, and the excitement of drawing near to the object of their long journey, animated them both with unusual spirits. Deborah's tongue was voluble in praise of the rich farms that spread out on the declivities of the hills, or embosomed in the protected vallies, called forth, as they deserved, the enthusiastic commendations of our experienced rustic. Ellen listened in silence while she gazed with the eye of an amateur upon this beautiful country, which possesses all the elements of the picturesque. Green hills crowned with flourishing villages—village spires rising just where they should rise; for the scene is nature's temple, and the altar should be there—lakes sparkling like gems in the distant vallies—Saddle mountain lifting his broad shoulders to the northern sky, and the Catskills defining with their blue and misty outline the western horizon. A sudden exclamation from Deborah fixed Ellen's attention to one spot in the wide spread landscape. “As I live,” she said, “there is the very place at last—see, Ellen, the yellow houses they told us of.” Ellen turned her eye to the long line of habitations of a uniform colour and B 2 appearance, which, stretching along the plain and sheltered by the surrounding hills, seem sequestered from the world, and present an aspect of peace and comfort, if not of happiness. Ellen, as others have done, wondered that this strange people, who in their austere judgment would condemn the delight that springs from natural beauty as the gratification of the `lust of the eye,' should have selected a spot of such peculiar charms. “Ah,” said Debby, as her eye wandered over the stubble fields and the rich crops that were yet unreaped, “these are knowing people—they understand their temporals—they have chosen their land well.” “Then,” thought Ellen, “it may be that the maxim, the useful is the beautiful,” holds good in relation to our mother earth, and that she lavishes her smiles upon those of her loyal children who seek her favours: sure I am, no professed admirers of the beauties of nature —no connoisseur in all the charms of the various combinations of mountain and valley, pasture hills and rich meadows, dashing streams and quiet lakes, could have selected a more beautiful residence than this.” Her meditations were suddenly cut short by another exclamation from Deborah, who had now turned an angle in the road and entered the village street. “Well, if this does not beat all! Just look here, Ellen, at this little bright stream,” and she pointed to a small rivulet that sparkled like a chain of burnished silver in the sunbeams; “see where it comes racing down the hill yonder, and here, where it crosses the street, it darts under ground as if to hide its capers from these solemn people— the thing has sense in it.” Ellen smiled, and asked “if it would not be well to imitate its discretion, and inquire at which house they should find the elder sister Susan?” Deborah immediately stopped her horse, and waited for the coming up of one of the brethren, who was approaching them from an adjoining field. She spent the few moments of waiting in admiring the large richly stocked garden, without weeds or waste places, the fine stone-posts to the fences, the neatly sawn wood, piled with mathematical exactness, the clean swept street, and all the neat arrangements of the shaker economy, so striking to an eye accustomed only to the slipshod ways of our country people. In the meanwhile Ellen was looking eagerly at the windows of a large house near which they had halted, to discern if possible the well-known features of Susan, or Emily, or any of the sisters who, as they passed the windows like shadows, stole an inquiring glance at the travellers. When the man had arrived within speaking distance, Deborah asked, “if he would be so good as to direct her where she could find Susan Allen!” “Yea,” he replied, “she dwells there;” and he pointed to the large house Ellen was surveying. “Is she at home?” asked Deborah. “Yea, I believe so.” Either Deborah's imagination was busy, or her sagacity detected more meaning in the man's face than was expressed in his brief answers. “Is Susan sick?” she asked hastily. “If ye have business with her ye can inquire for her at the house,” was all the reply vouchsafed. “Much thanks for his information,” said Debby, who felt too conscious of the liberty of free inquiry at all times and places, to need the permission granted in a manner so surly. They stopped at the house designated, and were admitted by one of the sisters who, in reply to their inquiry for Susan Allen, said, after a little hesitation, that, “she was not right well, and would not be able, she believed, to see strangers.” “Can we then,” asked Ellen, “see Emily Allen?” “Emily Allen!” exclaimed the sister, put a little off her guard by surprise, and then after a momentary pause and without making any explanations, she added, “I will acquaint elder sister that there are strangers here—if she knows who you are she may choose to see ye— be pleased to give me your names.” They gave them, and added an earnest request that Susan would see them. She had scarcely given Deborah and Ellen time to interchange their mutual apprehensions, ere she returned and bade them follow her. She led them up stairs and through a long passage to the elder sister's apartment, only distinguished from the others by being larger and more commodious—their conductor showed them into the room and then left them, closing the door after her. Susan was seated with her back to the door—on hearing it close she rose from her chair with an apparent effort, like one enfeebled by disease, and advanced towards Deborah and Ellen. Her face was ghastly pale, but there was no other sign of emotion. She gave a hand to each of her visitors, and said faintly, “ye are welcome—sit down, sit down.” They obeyed her and she reseated herself; a dead silence followed—even Deborah, fearless as she was, was awed into the deference of a momentary silence by the imposing solemnity of Susan's deportment. It was but for a moment, for her courage flowing back, “what signifies it?” said she; an expression that with her always signified the utter demolition of all barriers that opposed B 3 her purpose: “what signifies it—we may as well come to it first as last; what has happened to Emily?” “Emily is gone,” replied Susan, in a deep low tone, her eyes downcast, and her whole person fixed in statue-like stillness. “Gone!” echoed Deborah and Ellen in the same breath; “how—what is it you mean—she is not dead, surely?” “Would to God she had died,” replied Susan, clasping her hands and raising her eyes, from which the tears now flowed freely: “would to God she had died—in the faith.” Terrifying and incomprehensible as were Susan's words, neither Deborah nor Ellen ventured another question. There was something so strange and unnatural in her convulsive emotion, that it affected them as if a being that had passed the bounds of human feeling, should wake again to the pangs of mortal suffering. After some moments of `strong crying and tears,' she said, “I could have looked on and seen the breath of life leave her body, and yet have said with the Shunammite woman, `it is well.' I could have laid her away from me in the cold earth, and yet felt that it was well; who might not endure the brief space of time deprived of the dearest and the best?—but,” she added, shuddering, “I have lost her for time, and for eternity—this it is that wrings my heart with such grief as I thought never to have felt again.” Ellen was filled with frightful apprehensions for Emily's fate, and yet she knew not how to frame an inquiry about her. Even Deborah could not rally courage to hasten an explanation: she walked to the window desirous to conceal the feeling she could neither control nor express; but the frequent application of her handkerchief to her nose made the honest creature's sympathy quite audible. It was not long before Susan recovered a degree of composure that enabled her to relieve the impatient anxiety of her visitors, as far as the information she had to communicate could relieve it. She began her relation with the fact of Emily's clandestine departure with Harrington. She had herself first learned it on the succeeding morning, when she returned from Lebanon, whither she had, as our readers may remember, been suddenly summoned. She said she should herself have believed that Emily had not been a party to Harrington's treachery. She should have been sure he had forced her away, but that she remembered the child's emotion when she parted with her, and the mysterious language she then held, which was but too clearly explained by the event. The wiles of Harrington, of rather, she said, the wiles of Satan by his servant Harrington, had been too much for the poor girl; she had been caught in the toils, but she thanked God she had not fallen an easy prey. Ellen inquired if nothing had been heard of the fugitive since their departure. “Nothing.—One of the brethren had been dispatched to Albany, where, they had reason to believe, Harrington meant to put into execution a plan to defraud the society of a considerable sum of money. It was now the third day since Harrington's departure, and on the next day they expected the return of their agent, and it was more than probable that he would bring some intelligence of the fugitives. But, oh Ellen!” she concluded, “there is nothing to hope for— there is nothing more to fear—the worst has happened.” Ellen would not allow the case to be desperate; not that she could see any rational ground for favourable expectations, but hope is the happy instinct of youth. She showed Susan Emily's letter to her Eton friends, which at least intimated a wish to leave the society; she hinted at the attachment she believed Emily to have cherished for James Lenox, and she finished with expressing the belief that the poor girl had been the innocent dupe of Harrington's artifices, and had availed herself of his departure, as affording her an opportunity of returning to her friends. At another time this would have sounded like harsh consolation to Susan; but now, in comparison with what she feared, this was innocence and happiness, and she eagerly grasped at Ellen's suggestions. “God grant it may be so! “God grant it,” she reiterated. “Oh had I but known, Ellen, that it was in the child's heart to go back to you, I would have given her up as freely as Abraham yielded up Isaac. It would have been but honestly following her light, and though but a dim one, still she would have been saved from this utter ruin— and now if I could believe that she had fallen innocently, I might weep for her —yea, I must weep for her, but not these bitter hopeless tears.” Ellen entreated her to mitigate her grief, at least till she had more certain knowledge of the motives of Emily's departure. Susan evidently felt humbled to find herself the subject of the compassionate efforts of even the loveliest of the world's people; but she yielded insensibly to Ellen's beneficent influence, and even admitted that there was some consolation in her rational suggestions. Deborah had tact enough to perceive this was too delicate a case for her handling—quite out of her province, and beyond her skill; and therefore she had remained silent till she perceived that the elder sister was tranquillized, and that Ellen had expended all her consolatory arguments; she then, like a prudent officer, thought it best to retreat before another occasion for action should discover that their strength was exhausted, and she abruptly proposed their departure. Ellen, grieved to think they had no reason for delay, assented; and Susan, who at another time would have insisted on performing the rites of hospitality to friends that she both valued and loved, silently acquiesced, probably deeming it prudent in the present state of her feelings to exclude every exciting cause. This caution would seem incompatible with strong emotion; but it must be remembered that caution was habitual to the elder sister—was virtue in her estimation—and was essential to the preservation of her influence with the society, and had yielded for a short time only to the mastery of those powerful affections over which it had held a long and secure dominion. Such an exhibition of her feelings as that into which she had been surprised by the sudden appearance of Emily's friends would, she well knew, in the view of her brethren and sisters, degrade her to a level far below the frozen summits where they remained secure, regarding with equal contempt the earthly influences that bless and fertilize, or ravage and destroy. Before parting, she promised to despatch a messenger to Lebanon springs (whither Deborah informed her that she and Ellen were going, and should remain for a few days) with any intelligence that she might receive of the fugitives: she then summoned one of the sisters, and having requested her to provide some refreshments for her friends, she bade them farewell with her usual composure, save a little faltering of the voice, and trembling of the lip. The travellers were then conducted to a small parlour, where a table was quickly spread for their entertainment. It was covered with a cloth of the purest white by one of the sisters, who lingered in adjusting it, smoothing down the folds, pulling it first on one side, and then on the other, till this artifice of her innocent vanity had succeeded, and Deborah's liberal praises were bestowed on the delicate manufacture which had employed the skill and taste of the sisterhood. All the varieties of the `staff of life' were now displayed: bread made of the `finest of the wheat,' interspered with slices produced from the native Indian corn, which, in its prepared state, deserves still to retain the epithet of golden; next to this plate, groaning with its burden, were placed some tempting slices of the sad-coloured rye: these gifts of Ceres were so perfect in their kind, that the delicate goddess herself might have banquetted on them: then came the delicious butter and the purest honey—the fruits in season, and pies, cakes, and sweetmeats—accompanied (it may be thought somewhat incongruously,) by cheese, pickles, and cider—and to crown all, the aromatic tea-pot, diffusing like the censer at the ancient feasts, its fragrant fumes over all the board—with such incitement, what mortal with mortal senses, would have contemned the fare? If the truth must be told, the spirituelle Ellen Bruce, after her long abstinence, did not regard this repast with the indifference of a true heroine, and Deborah played her part as well as one of Homer's heroes might have done, had he had the good fortune to sit at a shaking quaker tea-table. She was yielding to the hospitable solicitations of the sister in attendance, and taking her fifth cup of tea, when Ellen reminded her a second time that the sun was fast declining, and that without despatch, they should be overtaken by the night before they reached Lebanon. Deborah's appetite submitted to the necessity of the case, and our travellers, after thanking their kind entertainer, took leave of her and left the village, as many other travellers have done, with a grateful sense of the unpretending hospitality of its simple inhabitants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. “Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence, Or why you stop our way with such prophetic greetings?” Macbeth. Ellen's mind had been so filled with commiseration for Susan; she was so much more in the habit of attending to others' feelings than her own, that until she had turned her back upon the shaker village, she did not feel the full weight of her own disappointment in regard to Emily. The thought of old Mrs. Allen's grief, and the most gloomy apprehensions in relation to the poor girl's destiny, engrossed her attention, and prevented her heeding Deborah's profound remarks on the “pattern people,” as she termed them. We would not insinuate that Deborah herself was unmoved by Emily's sorrowful case: she would have gone to the ends of the earth to have served her, or any other fellow-creature in distress, but it was an inviolable principle with her `never to cry for spilt milk.' After expressing some conjecture as to the uncertain fate of the poor girl—bewailing alternately her folly and her misfortunes, and anticipating with compassion the effect of this last severest stroke upon the old grandmother—she subsided into silence, and permitted Ellen to pursue her sad meditations undisturbed. She was at length awakened from them by the deepening of the twilight, and after a slight observation of the road, she asked Deborah “if she was quite sure she had not mistaken her way?” Deborah was certain she had taken the road that had been pointed out to her as the shortest cut to the springs, but she began to think they should have been wiser to have remained at the village, or to have taken the more travelled and more thickly settled road. “However,” she said, “it can be, Ellen, but four or five miles to the pool, and if the daylight does not last, we have a moon tonight, and thanks to fortune, neither you nor I are afraid of any thing.” “Oh, afraid—no, I trust not,” said Ellen, assuming a courage she did not feel, for her dejected mind had coloured with a melancholy hue the face of nature; and the hoarse sounds of the brawling brook on her right, and the deep unbroken wood on the left, affected her imagination with an undefined impression of some possible evil. They proceeded at a very slow rate, the ground was ascending, and the jaded old horse lagged along as if he felt the folly of turning his back upon the hospitalities of the village. They had pursued their way for some time in profound silence. Meanwhile the last traces of daylight had faded from the sky, and the stars began to shed their scanty light upon the grass-grown road. Deborah's patience was at last quite exhausted. “Ellen,” she said, “this is the most tedious lonesome way ever I travelled, it will never do to creep on this fashion, our horse, poor fellow, is coming to a dead stand—let us walk up the rest of the hill, you always go like a bird, and a walk will limber my old joints, and serve to warm me this chilly night.” Ellen acquiesced—and as they walked on together, Deborah said, she “had been thinking of all she had heard Squire Redwood say of the dangers of the old countries, and she was thinking it would be a pretty risky business for two defenceless women to be travelling alone at night in any land but our own.” “Yes, indeed,” replied Ellen; “but here, thank heaven, there can be no danger;” and as she spoke she drew nearer to Deborah, for she fancied she heard a rustling in the woods on her left. Deborah heard it too, for she stopped the horse, saying, “hark—what can that be?” She had hardly uttered the words when a large dog sprang upon them; both were startled, and looked anxiously in the direction from which the dog had come, but there was neither motion nor sound there. “Off, off, you brute!” said Deborah, and the dog thus harshly repulsed, turned as if to appeal to Ellen, crouched at her feet, ran from her, and then returned yelping—raised himself quite erect, fawned again on Ellen, wagged his tail, and expressed over and over again his mute and painful entreaties. “Words can't speak no plainer,” said Debby. “The poor creatur would have us go with him, but we must drive him away, this is no place nor time to be hindered.” “Certainly not—but,”— “But what, Ellen? speak out girl.” “Why I cannot bear to turn away from the poor thing, it seems wicked to VOL. III. C deny him. As she spoke she patted and caressed the dog: “there may be, I think there must be some person in distress in these woods—some one hunting may have been wounded, such accidents are common.” The dog seemed to understand her words or her caresses—he sprang again towards the wood, again returned, repeated all his modes of entreaty, pressing his suit with redoubled vigour, and Ellen replied to him by turning to Deborah, and saying with determination, “I must follow him.” “Are you clean out of your wits, child, to think of patroling these woods after this dog—and in case there should be any body here, for the Lord's sake, what could you or I do? Come, come along, it grows late.” But Ellen still hesitated, and Deborah added, “we cannot be far from a house, and we will alarm some men and send them here, which will be much the properest way.” Ellen from her childhood, and ever since the memorable night when a dog had aided in her preservation from the fire, had felt a strong attachment to the whole race, had studied their instincts and history; and while she stood looking at the petitioning animal, a thousand stories of similar significant actions glanced through her mind, and confirmed her resolution. “I must follow him, Deborah,” she repeated, “wait for me here a few moments, I will not go beyond call;” and she turned quickly away to avoid Debby's remonstrance. “Stop, Ellen—stop girl—do you think I will let you go alone after this jack-o'-lantern? if you wont hear to reason, why there's an end on't—I must go with you.” Ellen waited while Deborah secured the horse, and they then plunged into the wood after the dog, who trotted along the narrow foot path, turning round often as if to assure himself they C 2 still followed him. “Well,” said Deborah, “I don't speak from any fear— I never was afraid in my life, for I never saw danger; if I had, I might have been as scared as other people; but I think for two rational women, we ar e i an odd place, and following a strange leader.” “And that is as it should be,” replied Ellen, in an encouraging tone; “two errant damsels as we are, in quest of adventures—danger there is not, cannot be here, and we will not go much farther.” “No, that we will not; there is reason in all things—and as old Gilpin says, “'Twas for your pleasure you came here, You shall go back for mine.” “Certainly,” replied Ellen, smiling, “only go a little way farther, the moon is rising, there is a cleared place before us, and if we see nothing there, I will consent to return.” Ellen's benevolent purpose had conquered her womanish timidity: her tender and youthful spirit was susceptible to romantic influences that her companion could neither feel nor comprehend, and she pressed eagerly on, even in advance of Deborah, till on issuing from the wood, the dog bounded before her, and with one desperate howl threw himself beside a lifeless body. “Good heavens!” exclaimed Ellen, involuntarily shrinking back and seizing Deborah's arm, and pointing to the figure, which by the dusky light she could only discern to be that of a man, whether dead or living she knew not. Deborah, without speaking, without faltering or hesitating in the least, walked rapidly forward to the body, and stooping down, eagerly gazed on it for a moment, and then raising both her hands in token of astonishment to Ellen, who was timidly approaching, she exclaimed, “a dead Indian,—as sure as I am a living woman, a dead Indian.” “Is he certainly dead?” asked Ellen, compassionately bending over him. “Dead, child! look at his fallen jaw, his stark stiff limbs—poor soul! he is as dead as Christopher Columbus.” Ellen sate down on a prostrate trunk of a tree beside which the body lay, while Deborah examined it for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of the poor wretch's death. There was a wound on the temple from which the blood had flowed freely, and which Deborah thought might have been occasioned by his fall, as there was a stone lying near his head which it had probably first struck. Fragments of an earthen jug were lying about the body, and Deborah pointing to them said, “he has died Indian-fashion, Ellen, his dog and his jug by him; but after all, for aught we know, he may have died of old age, for he looks as old as Methusalem.” “Poor creature,” said Ellen; “and to die at last without a being to care for him.” “Oh, as to that, that is nothing,” said Debby, “and if it were, just look at that dog”—the dog was licking his master's face and breast—“there's many a one, Ellen, that dies on a feather bed, and them too that have houses and lands, without so true a friend and mourner as that poor brute. But come, Ellen, we can do no good here sermonizing the matter, we had best make our way back, and give notice of the man's death, that somebody may come and put him under ground, which is fitting should be done, seeing he is a human being, though an old Indian.” They rose to depart, and looking around they both perceived at the same moment the hut of Sooduck, (our readers no doubt have anticipated that this Indian was none other) which till now had been hidden from them by the deep shadows of the wood. “His wigwam, I declare!” exclaimed Deborah: “we'll get the poor carr'on into it; for I should be loath, for his dog's sake, that anything should happen to it till we can get it honourable burial. Do you, Ellen, open the door of the hut, and I will manage to drag the old carcass in.” Deborah made this division of labour to save Ellen the painful necessity of touching the dead body, and Ellen hastened to execute her appointed task. The door was fastened with a rope, and she found so much difficulty in extricating the knots, that Deborah came up with the body before she had effected it. Suddenly she stopped, and whispering to Debby, “Hark,” she said, “do you not hear a sound—a low moaning?” “Pooh, child, you are vapoury—it is nothing but a kitten,” replied Deborah: and laying down the body, she drew from her pocket a knife, with which she cut the cord that had fallen from Ellen's trembling hands—the door flew open, and a loud shriek from within startled even Deborah. She however stepped boldly forward, and saw before her, in the farthest corner of the hut, a terrified girl, who had sunk upon her knees, and covered her face with her hands in apparent expectation of some dreadful evil. “Merciful heaven, save me, save me!” she cried, as Deborah approached her. “What in the world is the matter with you, child?” said Deborah, “there is no one here that will hurt a hair of your head.” “We are friends—look at us, come to the light,” said Ellen. At the sound of Ellen's kind and gentle voice the spirit of fear departed from the half frantic girl: she rose, and looked with trembling hope at her deliverers: they all advanced to the door, the light fell on their faces, and an instant recognition followed. “Ellen!”—“Emily!”—“Deborah!” C 3 —“Is it possible?”—“It cannot be!”— they exclaimed in one breath. The joyful sense of hope, of protection, of safety, was almost too much for Emily. She threw her arms around Ellen's neck, and nearly fainted on her bosom. Her friends drew her to a little distance from the hut, and far enough to avoid her observation of the Indian: there Deborah left her to the soothing efforts of Ellen, while she returned to finish the arrangements for Sooduck's body. `An evil creature he was, no doubt,' thought Deborah, (for the discovery of Emily had thrown a strong light on Sooduck's character,) `an evil creature, but it is all passed to his own account now, poor wretch!' These and similar reflections of a compassionate nature filled Deborah's mind while she dragged in the body, composed it decently on the straw, and covered it with a blanket. The faithful dog took his station beside it, and there Deborah left him to keep guard, until she could send some persons to perform the last offices for his master. These arrangements occupied but a few moments, but they gave Emily time to recover a sufficient degree of strength and calmness to accompany her friends back to the chaise. The tide of joy that comes from a sense of deliverance from great danger is prompt and powerful in its operation. The timid despairing girl, released from her captivity, and in the presence of her friends, felt as if she had been translated to another world, and before they reached the chaise, she relieved their worst apprehensions, by giving them a sufficiently clear account of Reuben's treachery. From them she first learned Sooduck's death, and could afford no clue to its cause. He had left her as usual in the morning, and she had heard nothing since but the terrible uproar made by the dog, when (as she now conjectured) on seeing his fallen master, he had struggled, and at last successfully, to release himself from his confinement. It seemed probable that Sooduck, tempted by the superior quality of the liquor furnished by Harrington, or by its abundance, had indulged his appetite to such excess as to extinguish his feeble spark of life; or, as Deborah concluded, his fall had occasioned his death. After quite as much consideration as the miserable subject merited, the verdict of our fair jury was `accidental death.' Emily accounted for her terrors on the appearance of her friends, by saying that her fear of Harrington had converted every sound into a notice of his return. It seemed utterly impossible for the poor girl to express her joy that she had been rescued from him, and her gratitude to her deliverers. She had not once mentioned the elder sister's name in her brief relation of her flight, but Ellen, ever considerate of others, proposed as they reached the chaise, that they should return to the village, and relieve Susan at once from her painful apprehensions. Emily said nothing, for she hesitated between her wish to see and to relieve her kind friend, and her reluctance to venture within her prison bounds. Deborah cut the deliberation short by saying, `No, no, Ellen, you have had your way once, and a good way it proved, and I shall think to my dying day that the Lord led you up through them woods — but now I must have mine. There is no knowing,” she whispered to Ellen, “what might happen if we went back; `a bird in the hand,' you know — Come, jump in, Ellen—jump in, Emily, my little god-send, and we'll on as fast as possible.” Ellen acquiesced, secretly resolving with the morning dawn to despatch a messenger with the good news to Susan: a resolution she exactly performed. The travellers then proceeded at good speed to Lebanon springs, and arrived there before midnight, without any other interruption than that occasioned by Deborah's `keeping good faith with the dog,' as she termed it, by stopping at the first house on their way to give information of Sooduck's death. As Emily Allen's connexion ceased from this time for ever with the shaker society, it may be best to inform our readers, without troubling them again to recur to the subject, with the result of Harrington's expedition to Albany. Harrington had received from Freeborn, the ruling elder of the society at Hancock, a check for five thousand dollars, which was the principal part of a sum lodged to the credit of the society in a bank in Albany, where they were in the habit of depositing the surplus money which they received from the sale of their productions of agriculture and manufactures. This money had been at various times received in the market of Albany, and deposited in the bank for safe keeping; and these five thousand dollars were now wanted to pay the purchase-money of an adjoining farm, which the elders had determined to add to their possessions. It was however designed by Harrington for a very different application. Eager to secure the money, he went to the bank immediately upon its being opened in the morning, and presented the check for payment. The clerk who received it, observed that the check was payable not to bearer, but to order, and that it must be endorsed before it could be paid. Harrington said that he would endorse it, which he immediately did, and presented it again for payment. This delay and conversation attracted the notice of the cashier, who took up and examined the draft as the clerk was counting out the money to Harrington. “Stop,” said he, “the check is payable to the order of Reuben Harrington and John Jacobs, and must be endorsed by them both. Elder Freeborn is a very particular man about worldly matters, and as he has made his check payable to the order of two people, we must have the order of both of them.” Harrington could not restrain the expression of a little more impatience than became his garb and assumed character: he, however, received back the check, and said that he would step to friend Jacobs who lived in the next street, and procure his endorsement. He then called on Jacobs and requested him to endorse the check. This Jacobs was a sober staid citizen, who had often had dealings with the shaker society, and had contracted some acquaintance with the elders, and particularly elder Freeborn. When Harrington had explained the business, Jacobs, after a little reflection, said that he saw no harm which could come to him from endorsing the check, which he accordingly did. “Friend Freeborn,” said he, “is a careful man, and likes to have his business done right. I will step and get the money for you myself.” He went out, and returned after a few minutes with bank notes to the amount of the check. He then entered into some general conversation with Harrington, who restrained his impatience for the actual possession of the prize as much as possible: at last, however, he observed that he must be going, as he had business to do in the city that day before he returned home. Jacobs took no notice of this hint, but continued the conversation upon the subject of some shaker ploughs which he had for sale on commission. At last Harrington asked him directly for the money. “You shall have it,” replied Jacobs, “as soon as you give me elder Freeborn's order for it.” Harrington said that he had no such order, and that none was necessary; that the check was in his favour as well as in that of Jacobs, and that he was an elder as well as Freeborn. “Elder Freeborn,” said Jacobs, “has the care of the prudentials. At any rate, I have received this money upon his check, and I must have his order before I pay it away to any body.” Harrington entreated and remonstrated, but the man of business seemed inclined to adhere to his punctilio. Harrington had before entertained some apprehension that his fraudulent designs were not wholly unsuspected by the shrewd and cautious Freeborn, and it now occurred to him that the embarrassment in which he was placed might not be wholly accidental. His threats and flatteries only served to confirm the cool and wary Jacobs in his suspicion of Harrington's dishonest intentions—at last, quite discouraged, Harrington left the impracticable trader, cursing the superior cunning that had baffled his well-concerted project. His next concern was in regard to Emily. It appeared easiest, and would certainly be safest to abandon the wreck —to give up the ship; but he had so long flattered himself with the possession of this young creature, he so thirsted for revenge against Susan, and his pride was so much interested in at least a partial success, that after some anxious deliberation with himself, he determined to return to Emily, not doubting that she would accept her liberty on any terms he should vouchsafe to offer. Accordingly he left Albany late in the afternoon, and having travelled all night, he arrived at Sooduck's hut just at the break of day on the morning after Emily's escape. It is not necessary, and certainly would be difficult to paint his consternation at the sight that there greeted him. But there was no time for inquiry or delay. It was important to him that he should not be recognised in that neighbourhood. He was not however destined to escape without farther mortification. On re-entering the public road he was met by some men, who had collected in consequence of Deborah's notice, to dispose of Sooduck's body. They had heard the story of his villainy which was already in general circulation. They knew him well, and moved by an intuitive love of justice, as well as by a friendly feeling to the society, they stopped his horses, bound him hand and foot, and drove him in triumph back to his shaker brethren. The messenger despatched by Ellen arrived about the same time; and Susan, thus relieved from her anxiety, and rejoicing in the innocence and safety of Emily, was able to assist at the council that was called to deliberate on the proper measures to be taken in regard to the culprit. The result of a short conference was equivalent to the sentence of the quaker against his dog. `I will not myself kill thee,' he said, `but I'll turn thee on the world and give thee a bad name.' Reuben Harrington was dispossessed of every thing he held belonging to the society but the clothes that covered him, and sent out to wander upon the earth, despised and avoided, enduring all the misery of unsuccessful and unrepented guilt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. “The billows on the ocean, The breezes idly roaming, The clouds' uncertain motion, They are but types of woman.” Burns. It is probably well known to most of our readers, that Lebanon is a favourite resort during the hot months. It lies on a post-road from Boston to Albany—is of easy access from New York—and from the beauty of its scenery, the salubrity of its air, and its proximity to Saratoga springs, attracts, for a short time at least, the throng of visitors to those celebrated waters. The mineral spring that is nominally the chief attraction of the place, should not be forgotten; if not as efficacious as its neighbours would fain believe, it is at least innocent—no one can forget it who has seen the bright waters for ever bubbling up from the bosom of the earth, and admired the sycamore tree that stands beside the sparkling fountain like its guardian genius, and drops its protecting branches over it. Our travellers were fortunate in the time of their arrival: large parties had left the place the preceding day, and they were able to obtain two apartments in Mr. Hull's well-known house; one was assigned to Ellen, and the other Emily shared with her relation and true friend Deborah. Ellen, wearied as she was, did not retire to bed until she had written a note to the `elder sister,' containing all the particulars of Emily's distressful experiences and providential rescue; nor till she had obtained a promise from her landlord that he would despatch it with the first ray of light. The commission was faithfully executed, as might have been expected from his obliging character. Even after Ellen had performed this duty, it was long ere she could compose her mind to sleep. Relieved of all anxiety concerning Emily, her thoughts reverted to the friends she had left at Eton; hovered about Mr. Redwood with an undefinable interest, and finally concentrated on Charles Westall. All the circumstances of her brief intercourse with him passed in revision before her; and she dwelt on each particular over and over again, as a miser counts his treasures—the cherished recollections of memory gave place to the (perhaps unbidden) visions of hope, and all at last faded away like the bright tints of the evening cloud, and she sunk into profound repose. Deborah's weariness prevailed over the force of long habit, and neither she nor her protegees awoke till a late hour in the morning, when, in compliance with Ellen's persuasions, she ordered breakfast in her room: after partaking it with her usual appetite, she left her less enterprising companions, and sallied forth to reconnoitre the premises, and to try the effect of bathing on her rheumatism. Neither Ellen nor Emily felt any disposition in the present state of their minds to remain at Lebanon. Emily's affections, released from the captivity of an imaginary duty, had bounded forward to their natural destination; and Ellen was impatient to accelerate her return to Mrs. Harrison, to whom alone she could unburthen her heart, but they both knew that Deborah had resolved to remain at the springs for some days, and that her resolution once formed, was quite as immutable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. They felt too that after the great inconveniences the VOL. III. D good woman had endured, and the essential services she had rendered them, there would be a species of ingratitude in opposing her wishes. Ellen had not a nature to resist the persuasion of such a motive: the gentle Emily never resisted any thing, and they both prepared to appear with the best grace they could before the gay and the fashionable under the conduct of Miss Deborah. Emily's life had been too retired and humble to expose her to any mortification from the appearance and manner of her chaperone, yet she shrunk with natural timidity from the possibility that her history might be known, and that she might therefore be exposed to the curious gaze and free remarks of strangers. But Ellen encouraged her with the assurance that as they were all strangers, there was no clue to the discovery that she was the little runaway shaker, and having made her doff her shaker dress, and put on a simple mourning frock which she had provided for her, she re-modelled her hair—formed some becoming curls on her temples— and imparted such a wordly tastefulness to her appearance, that the simple girl confessed herself so completely metamorphosed, that she hardly recognised her own image. As neatness and simplicity were the presiding graces at Ellen's toilette, its duties were very expeditiously despatched. Happily for her, since she did not possess the gifts of fortune, the loveliness of her face and figure made her superior to her favours or arts, at least so thought Deborah, as well as more competent judges; for when she re-entered after her perambulations, she said (the only speech of hers on record that betrays any femality,) she did not believe the United States could produce two girls “prettier to look at.” Ellen felt some consternation when she added, that “though she was not much D 2 of a dresser, she liked to rig out suitably to her voyage; and as she had observed by the ladies she had met, that Lebanon was a dressy place, her young folks should not be ashamed of her.” She then proceeded to unpack her trunk, and drew from its stores, a `lutestring changeable,' a manufacture of the olden time, in which the colours were skilfully combined, to produce a constant alternation from one hue to another; the fancy of Deborah's youth had been orange and purple, and as it was her pride and boast that she never altered her apparel in subservience to the whims of fashion, the `changeable' that had remained through all chances and changes unchanged, and always “like a robe canonical, ne'er seen, but wondered at,” was once more dragged forth to the light of day, and its antique and unbending dignity exposed to the levity of modern gossamer belles. Ellen watched Deborah with dismay, while she drew on the closely fitted sleeve, and laced the formal waist, and adroitly placed her gold beads over her kerchief that their light might not be hid. After her first and brief sacrifice to the graces, turning to Ellen, she said, with a complacency that her young friend could not but pity, “now I think I am fit company for any body—what do you say, Ellen?” “Fit company for any body you always are, Miss Deborah,” replied Ellen, “without any outward adorning; but I think your dress admits of one improvement;” and while she made an effort to restrain the smile that in spite of her hovered on her lips, she persuaded Deborah that a lace shawl, which she dexterously threw over her shoulders, improved her appearance. Deborah assented, and the dinner bell ringing, our heroine, with the courage of a martyr, slipped her arm into one of Deborah's, while Emily, in happy ignorance of the ludicrous antiquity of her friend's costume, took the other. Thus they entered the dining room where the company was already assembled, and having taken their seats, were precisely at that point of momentary silence that precedes the general onset. The rustling of Deborah's silk attracted some observation, but it was not till she moved to the head of the table, and took possession of a seat that had been reserved for a gentleman who usually occupied it, while Ellen and Emily slid into vacant chairs on each side of her, that every eye was fixed upon the novel group. Deborah's figure, in her usual apparel, was rather grotesque, but not sufficiently so to provoke or excuse laughter—she would have looked between Ellen and Emily like the gnarled oak, somewhat scathed by time and accident, but still respectable in its hardy age, whose firm protection the tender vines had sought, and bloomed around it in all the freshness of youth and beauty. But the yellow and purple changeable was irresistibly ludicrous. Some lively girls who sat near the head of the table began a titter: the infection was caught by their neighbours, and all, even grave matrons and staid old gentlemen, were compelled to turn their faces, hide them with their handkerchiefs, or outrage all breeding, violate all decorum, and laugh outright. Poor little Emily, not discerning the subject of the mirth, and seeing it was directed towards the part of the table she occupied, believed herself the subject of it, and half frightened out of her senses, averted her head to conceal her blushes, and her tears. Deborah's sagacity was at fault for a moment, but the truth suddenly flashed across her mind, and involuntarily rising and turning to Ellen, “am I their music?” she exclaimed; when seeing that Ellen too—for the truth must be told—had lost all command of her risibles, and had joined the laughers, her astonishment expressed, “and thou, too? this is the unkindest cut of all;” and she would have probably said something equivalent to it, but the attention of the company was diverted by a bustle at the door; and Mr. Redwood entered, leading in Mrs. Westall, and followed by Miss Redwood attended by Charles Westall. Deborah's tall figure standing erect at the head of the table first caught Mr. Redwood's eye, and to the surprise of the company he exclaimed, “Miss Deborah!—my old friend—God bless you, I am glad to see you and Miss Bruce— my dear Ellen,” he said, advancing with the greatest cordiality, and shaking Deborah's hand heartily, and kissing Ellen's, “this is delightful, to meet you again—and so unexpectedly!” Deborah forgot her irritation in her sudden pleasure, and returned Mr. Redwood's greeting with all her heart. “I thought, Sir,” she said, “that you were half way to Boston by this time.” “I was half way there, Miss Deborah, but my courage failed me:—I found my strength and spirits unequal to enjoying the society of Boston. I have not philosophy enough to resist its allurements, so I turned my face homeward, and have been guided hither,” he concluded, looking at Ellen, “by my good genius.” Ellen, disconcerted by the unexpected appearance of the party, could not command words to reply to Mr. Redwood, or to return Mrs. Westall's polite recognition. Mr. Redwood observed her embarrassment. “We are keeping our friends standing,” he said; “let us pass on, Mrs. Westall; my daughter I believe is at the lower end of the room:” then lowering his voice to Ellen, he added, “we shall see you immediately after dinner.” Deborah looked after Mr. Redwood D 3 as he walked away, and shook her head: “he is dreadfully changed, Ellen, since we left him—poor man, he is not long for this world.” Ellen had noticed that his face, as the glow of surprise faded from it, reverted to a sickly, ghastly paleness: but at this moment a subject of stronger interest occupied her mind. She ventured a timid glance towards that part of the room to which Miss Redwood had turned on seeing her: there appeared to be some delay about the arrangement of the seats for the new comers. In the meantime Miss Redwood was still standing with her hand in Westall's, and receiving the compliments of a gentleman in the uniform of a British officer, who had just approached from the table. Ellen fancied she saw, for the feelings that made her heart at that moment throb almost audibly have a wonderful effect on the vision—she fancied she saw a mingled expression of impatience and joy on Westall's countenance, and a moment after she heard him coming towards her with rapid steps. The dread of observation—the fear of exposing those emotions that every delicate woman instinctively conceals, restored to her at once her self-command, and when she gave Westall her hand, she simply evinced the frank pleasure that became the reception of any friend, and she preserved her self-possession in spite of Deborah's exclaiming with her usual bluntness, “Well, now Mr. Westall, it does a body's heart good to see the face of a friend in a strange land, and especially yours, and looking so joyful too.” “I shall like my face the better all my life,” replied Westall, “for speaking such plain truth: it would be but a poor index if it did not make the pleasure of this unexpected meeting intelligible. Miss Bruce, I rejoice to see,” he added, in an under tone, “that you have been successful in your benevolent mission— but my mother is beckoning to me— farewell till after dinner.” So important an event as the arrival of a celebrated beauty at a watering-place effected a complete diversion in favour of Deborah's changeable—and the regard shown to her by Mr. Redwood shielded her from the ridicule of the company. After complimenting by her keen relish a variety of viands within her reach, Deborah turned to observe how her protegées fared. “I am glad, Emily,” she said, “to see you have an appetite; but Ellen child, what ails you? you eat as people eat in dreams, that is to say, you don't eat at all: you must be more nice than wise, not to find something to suit your palate on this table, where there is such a fulness, and all fresh too. Take a piece of the chicken, Ellen—it is a nice chicken for the time o' year—by the way, I must find out how this young Mr. Hull feeds his chickens—try a piece, Ellen—” Ellen declined it. “Well then, take a piece of the lamb, child. I can assure you it is a firstling of the flock, tender and fat; or if you don't fancy lamb, let that gentleman help you off the dish next him—what do you call it, Sir?” “Ragout, madam.” “Well, I never heard the name before, and I can't tell now any more than when I ate it, whether it's fish or flesh, but for a new-fashioned thing it's very pretty tasted—the fare is excellent. I have ate a little of all, and I freely give it my recommend. Come, Ellen, don't split peas any longer, but take a little something—do.” Ellen continued, however, obstinately to refuse Deborah's solicitations; and her attention being soon engrossed by the pies and puddings which she appeared to deem worthy successors of the meats, Ellen was relieved from her persecutions, and permitted for a short interval to chew the food of sweet and bitter fancies—a kind of food that had quite spoiled her appetite for any grosser elements. The unforeseen meeting with the Redwood party, had suggested to Ellen's mind hopes and fears—resolutions and irresolutions. It must be confessed that there was something in the expression of Charles Westall's face, and in the tones of his voice, that conveyed to her heart an assurance of consolation for any evils that might await her. Love insinuates its language through the eyes and in the modulations of the voice, but those alone whose senses have been touched by the magic herb of Oberon can comprehend it—to all others it is like the `harmony of immortal souls'— they cannot hear it. Who could have imagined that Ellen had deduced from her brief interview with her lover the absolute certainty that she had nothing to fear from the arts of Miss Redwood! Who could have imagined that it strengthened her resolution to await the reversion of Mrs. Westall's kindness, and the developement of her own history! But so it was. Certain that his attachment to her had not been shaken by Caroline's artifices, nor his mother's distrust, she was willing to leave all the rest to time and chance; or rather—for we are doing injustice to the religious habits of her mind—to the kind Providence that had thus far watched over her. Ellen dreaded coming in collision again with Miss Redwood: she trembled at the recollection of the unaccountable, mysterious hatred which Caroline had expressed at their last interview; but after a little reflection she arrived at the tranquillizing conclusion that the eclat that would attend Miss Redwood on the scene where they were now to play their parts, would render her quite indifferent to so insignificant a personage as herself; and in the shelter of her humility, she hoped to pass without observation or envy. She resolved to forego the pleasure of Mr. Redwood's society, to make the more difficult sacrifice of Westall's, and in short, to seclude herself, as much as possible, in her own apartment. Ellen learned from the remarks of the persons sitting around her, that Miss Redwood's fame had preceded her arrival. “Poor girls!” said a good-natured looking old gentleman, who was surrounded by his nieces, to whom he addressed himself, “you may hang your harps upon the willows now, or play a requiem on them to your departed glory —this southern luminary will quench your light. See, my poor little Anne, your military beau has fallen within the sphere of her attractions already.” “I could not in reason, uncle,” retorted the young lady, “expect such a light material as Fitzgerald, to resist Miss Redwood's solid attractions. Give up your old-fashioned whim, uncle, of leaving a modicum to your relations to the seventeenth degree—banish all,” she continued, glancing her eyes sportively around upon her companions—“sisters, cousins, all — all, but faithful Anne. Make me your sole heiress, uncle—add golden spurs to my armour, and Fitzgerald the prize, I will not fear to enter the lists against Miss Redwood.” “That's a brave girl, Anne, and a good-tempered girl, too,” replied her uncle, patting her cheek. “I like a girl that can lose an admirer, and bear a joke about it; you are ten times prettier Anne, in my eyes, than Miss Redwood. I would not exchange your good-humoured dimples for all her beauty. I observed that as she entered the room, something crossed my young lady's humour—she flashed the fires of her bright eyes towards this end of the table, and `the angry spot did glow on Cæsar's brow.”' There was a fat lady sitting next the speaker, blowing away sturdily with her fan, and waiting impatiently for her turn to pur forth. She was one of those busy people, whose minds seem to be a sort of alms-basket, into which they collect odds and ends of information that belong to every body's affairs but their own. After saying that she fancied any one who thought Miss Redwood was not amiable would find himself greatly in error, she detailed, with the air of consequence with which she felt herself invested by the possession of such important particulars, the news she had picked up about the Redwood party, in which, as our readers will observe, there was the usual proportion of truth that obtains in such rumours. “An express,” she said, “had arrived the day before to secure rooms for the party. They had been detained a long time in a miserable hovel in Vermont, in consequence of a terrible wound which Mr. Redwood had received when he was wrecked on the lake, or overturned in his carriage—she was not sure which, but she understood the account was in the newspapers at the time. Poor Miss Redwood had suffered shockingly. Her friends had been apprehensive that her life would be sacrificed to her fatigue and confinement with her father. Her life at the time of the accident had been saved by the young gentleman who was with them; and it was believed, indeed,” she added with a simper, “she might say it was certain they were now engaged; for Mr. Redwood, who had withheld his consent on account of the young man's want of fortune, had lately become interested in Mr. Westall, and all now was going on smoothly.” “What trumpery! what nonsense!” Deborah repeatedly ejaculated in an under voice, as the narrator proceeded, when Ellen, frightened lest she should take up her testimony, whispered a caution which she had the prudence to heed. Some one asked of the lady informer the source of her information. She said that a particular friend, who had left the springs that morning, had shewn her a letter from a lady in Charleston, who had seen a letter which had been received from Miss Redwood.” “Your information, madam, is doubtless authentic,” said the old gentleman, affecting a credulity which he was far enough from feeling; “but I am quite happy to observe, that the apprehensions of the young lady's friends concerning her health were groundless. She is a perfect Hebe.” “Oh, that may well be, Sir—young people recover surprisingly; but it is sure that Miss Redwood remained with her father night and day for weeks— how could she help it! The people, you know, so far in the country, are quite barbarians.” Ellen, perceiving that it would be utterly impossible for Deborah to suppress her indignation much longer, proposed withdrawing from the table, and Deborah assented, loth to retreat without giving battle. As they left the dining-room, the British officer, who had taken his seat next Miss Redwood, (and who was the same Captain Fitzgerald of whom she had made such honourable mention in a letter to her grandmother) said to her, “in the name of heaven, who is that ancient oddity? I saw your father address her as he came into the room.” “She is a Vermont woman—a demisavage, that we met in our travels.” “So I imagined—she looks like a Yankee militia major, dressed in his mother's wedding gear; but that pretty girl with her, who seems to belong to another age and country, who is she?” “The one in black, you speak of?” “Pardon me—she is an innocent looking little concern enough, but I spoke of the other, who is, as Hamlet says, you know, `far more attractive metal.”' “Oh, she is—I don't precisely know —she is a connection of the old woman's —at least a sort of dependent on her.” Captain Fitzgerald observed that for some reason or other, his inquiry had been displeasing to Miss Redwood, and a firm believer in whatever impeaches the virtue of the female sex, he remembered the cynical rule that forbids a man to flatter one woman in the presence of another. “I should not have noticed the young lady,” he said, “but there has been such an absolute dearth of beauty here since my arrival! Upon my soul, Miss Redwood,” he added, with a prudent depression of voice, “I should have forgotten what beauty was, but for a certain bright image indelibly stamped on the tablets of my memory. This young lady had one indisputable charm; she was your herald—the morning star that preceded the sun—but what could have induced a civilized being to come to a watering place under such auspices?” “My evil genius,” thought Caroline, and she said, “I think I heard they were going to visit the shakers in the vicinity. They have some connexions there—I fancy they have merely stopped here, en passant, for their dinner, but really,” she concluded, shrugging her shoulders, “I know nothing about them: one can't, you know, fill one's head with the affairs of such people.” Mr. Redwood had observed with a feeling of impatience Captain Fitzgerald's devotion to his daughter: he had been waiting for a pause in their conversation, which was conducted in an under tone, to remind her “that she had not,” as he said, “yet paid her respects to Miss Bruce, and their good friend Deborah.” “Shall I have the honour of conducting you to the drawing-room, Miss Redwood?” asked Westall, who had been long watching for an opportunity to follow Ellen. “Thank you—no, I must first go to my room and dispose of my riding dress; but I will be obliged to you to make my apologies to the Vermontese, as they will probably be gone before I have an opportunity of seeing them. Come, Mrs. Westall, shall we find our way to our apartment?” “Excuse my mother, Miss Redwood,” said Westall. “You will not,” he added, turning to Mrs. Westall, “risk losing the pleasure of seeing our friends?” “Certainly not—I will first go with Miss Redwood, and then return to you, Charles.” “Do not put yourself to any inconvenience on my account, Mrs. Westall —the attendance of my servant will do just as well as yours.” Mrs. Westall felt the insulting implication of Miss Redwood's reply. She had been blinded by her self-love, and her next strongest passion—her ambition for her son—Miss Redwood's sudden and exclusive devotion to Fitzgerald had done more towards enlightening her mind on the subject of the young lady's merits, than all their previous intercourse, and she left her with a feeling that prepared her to see Ellen in the most favorable light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. E CHAPTER XXI. “Il y a dans l'esprit humain deux forces très distinctes, l'un inspire le besoin de croire, l'autre celui d'examiner.” Madame de Stael. Our readers will pardon us for deferring their curiosity, (if indeed they have any) while we give a brief exposé of the different states of feeling which the several members of the Redwood party brought with them to Lebanon. After Ellen's departure from Eton, Mr. Redwood, no longer having any strong inclination to protract his stay there, made arrangements to recommence his journey immediately. He took leave of the Lenox family with sincere regret, and left them such demonstrations of his gratitude as impressed them with the belief that his generosity was unbounded. He travelled very slowly in obedience to the advice of his physician; but notwithstanding his caution, and the most vigilant devotion from Charles Westall, he found his health daily diminishing, and he proposed to relinquish the long-projected visit to Boston. The Springs in August offered a more tempting theatre than town. Caroline was all acquiescence and sweetness, and the travellers proceeded to Lebanon. After Ellen left Eton, and during the journey, Caroline redoubled her assiduities to recover her lost influence over Westall. “Scarce once herself, by turns all womankind;” she affected every grace, she pretended to every virtue that she believed would advance her designs. Mrs. Westall, a willing dupe, believing at least half her pretensions, and hoping the future might verify the rest, was a most devoted auxiliary; and E 2 Mr. Redwood began to indulge sanguine expectations that he should realize his dearest hopes—he augured well from Caroline's serious efforts to win Westall's affections, and in spite of his experience and habitual despondency, he hoped every thing from Westall's influence over her. There is no limit to the power of a strong and virtuous attachment, but that Miss Redwood was not capable of feeling for any one, and certainly did not for Westall. When she first saw him, his fine exterior and refined manners had pleased her;—accustomed to the gallantries of admirers, till they had become quite indispensable, and having no other subject to try the power of her charms upon, she played off her little coquetries on him, without any other design than to produce a present effect. Afterwards the matter assumed a graver cast—her vanity—the pride of beauty, wealth, and station, became interested in the contest with Ellen—and subsequently still stronger motives stimulated her rivalry, and made success important. Never was there a man who had less of the coxcomb than Westall, but he could not choose but see the net that was spread in his sight. To an indifferent observer of the effect of Miss Redwood's efforts, it would have been plain that `the lightnings played on the impassive ice,' but she did not so interpret Westall's frequent abstractions and studied politeness; for vanity dulls the keenest perceptions, and is itself at least as blind as love. When the party arrived at Lebanon, Mr. Redwood's first impulse at the unexpected sight of Ellen was sincere pleasure; Caroline's alarm, Mrs. Westall's regret, and her son's unqualified delight. Ellen persisted in secluding herself almost wholly in her own apartment: she resisted the solicitations of Mr. Redwood, who could not voluntarily forego the pleasure of her society, the only pleasure of which he now seemed susceptible; she studiously avoided meeting Westall, except in the public rooms, and she had always some pretext to decline the walks he proposed, and the rides he arranged to include her. Caroline, who seemed only to notice her by a freezing bow as they sometimes met in their passage to and from the eating room, really watched every movement, and after balancing all the motives that she believed could operate on Ellen's mind, she came to the conclusion, that her rival had abandoned the field. This somewhat abated her own ardour—the devotion of a host of admirers, who were crowding around her for recognition or introduction, and the highly seasoned flatteries of Captain Fitzgerald, gave her a distaste to the tame civilities of Westall, and not three days had elapsed before she was vacillating between the gratification of her pride and resentment, and the pleasure of granting the suit which Fitzgerald was already pressing upon her. Deborah was the only member of either of the two parties who was quite satisfied and tranquil; but she was determined, as she said, not to come so far and spend so much time and money without having her `pennyworth of pleasure.' The affair of the changeable had caused her but a momentary vexation, the only indications that she remembered it were, that she had carefully refolded and restored it to her trunk without one word of comment, and that she never again appeared in that ambitious array. If ever a shadow obscured Deborah's good nature, it was as fleeting as an April cloud. The notice of Mr. Redwood and Westall, which they seemed proud of bestowing, was a warrant for her respectability. And though the town-bred young ladies thought her quite terrible, and their beaus pronounced her a monster, the lovers of the picturesque admired her figure as she strided through the rooms, staring about her with fearless curiosity, with her holiday work, (her knitting) in her hands. She was sometimes seen surrounded by a group of boys, relating to them a revolutionary story with all the animation of personal experience; and her little auditors (for boys are naturally belligerents) would warm with the spirit of their fathers, and long to `fight their battles o'er again.' She even attracted the notice of the French Ambassador, who made many inquiries of her in relation to the mode of agriculture and domestic economy of our common farmers, and seemed so satisfied of the accuracy and intelligence of her replies, that he condescended to record them in his note book. But Deborah's stable mind was quite unmoved by attention or neglect. She inquired every body's name, and learned something of every body's history. She sometimes mingled in the crowd, and took part in the conversation, and sometimes stood aloof making her own observations. In short, she went up and down wherever she listed with lawless independence; and her sagacity, simplicity, and good nature always obtained her sufferance, and sometimes procured her attention and respect. This was the posture of affairs when our female friends on entering the parlour one morning in their way to the breakfast-room, were encountered by the Armstead party. Miss Campbell sprang towards Ellen, exclaiming, while her fine face witnessed her sincerity, “my dear Miss Bruce, I am delighted to find you are not gone from Lebanon. I should have died with uncertainty and impatience the last five minutes, but that I most opportunely met my friend Charles Westall, at whom E 3 I have been speering questions about you, which he answered as patiently as if he had been bred in the Socratic school—and, to do him justice, he asked as many as he answered. But how comes it,” she added, hardly allowing Ellen time to return the kind greetings of the other members of her party, “how comes it that you have not mentioned our meeting, and the fortunate incident that broke the ice of ceremony, and made us friends at once? I have thought of nothing else since, at least it has given an agreeable hue to all my other thoughts: you hesitate—you were too modest to proclaim your own heroism. Oh, my dear Miss Bruce, the days are past when one might `do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame'—this is the age of display—of publication. However, thanks to my generous interposition, you have lost nothing on this occasion by your modesty. I have told the whole story to Mr. Westall—every particular of it, with a suitable number of epithets and exclamations, and have had the pleasure of hearing him put all his ohs and ahs in the right places, and with the right emphasis, and conclude with a `just like Miss Bruce.' “But here,” she continued, seeming at least not to notice the deep blush that suffused Ellen's cheeks, “here comes the eighth wonder of the world—the beautiful Miss Redwood—and we common mortals must fall back to gaze on her.” Caroline entered leaning on Mrs. Westall's arm; her father was beside her. Captain Fitzgerald joined them as they came into the room, and they passed near the window at which Westall and the ladies were standing. Fitzgerald recognised Miss Campbell in a dubious inquiring manner, which expressed, `do we meet as friends?' and her cold bow replied unequivocally, `as strangers.' Caroline turned towards Westall— “your mother, and papa,” she said, “have settled it that we take our drive to the shakers after breakfast. You are no laggard, and we shall depend on your being ready—and do be so good as to get a direction from Miss Bruce to aunt, the elect lady.” “Your aunt the elect lady!” exclaimed Miss Campbell. “No, replied Ellen,” quite unmoved by a stroke that was meant to mortify her, “I have no aunt among the shakers, neither, if I understand their order, is there any `elect lady.”' “Oh, I was mistaken then,” said Caroline, “it is this Miss Allen's aunt, that I allude to—perhaps,” she added, still addressing Westall, “you may persuade her to go with us as pioneer: she must be quite familiar with the curiosities of the place, and possibly she may favour us with an introduction to some of the gifted brethren.” Poor Emily blushed and trembled as every eye turned on her, and edging herself behind Ellen, she whispered in all simplicity, “do tell her I can't go.” “My dear Emily, Miss Redwood knows you cannot go.” “Afraid of being reclaimed,” said Caroline, enjoying the confusion into which she had thrown the simple girl. “Never mind, child, we shall do very well without you—I will trust to luck for a chance to quiz some of the old broad brims,” “Caroline,” said Mr. Redwood, “we shall lose our places at the breakfast table by this delay. Do you go with us, Westall?” “The ladies must excuse me, I have an engagement after breakfast.” “Miss Redwood bit her lips with vexation, and then turning to Captain Fitzgerald, “have you too an engagement?” she said. “No engagement but on the field of battle could supersede your commands, Miss Redwood,” replied the gallant captain. “Then you will occupy the vacant seat in our carriage?” Fitzgerald bowed his delighted assent, Mr. Redwood asked Westall in a whisper, if his engagement would interfere with his giving him half an hour after he should return from his ride? Westall replied, “certainly not;” and they made an appointment to meet in the course of the morning. Westall, true to the moment of his appointment, tapped at Mr. Redwood's door and was admitted. He found him extremely pale and somewhat agitated. “You are not, Sir, I fear, as well as usual this morning,” he said, “your ride has fatigued you?” “I am as well as usual,” he replied, in a melancholy tone, “but my health is every day becoming worse: disease would do its work soon enough, but there are other causes that accelerate my deeline:” he paused for a moment.— “Westall, I am going to repose a confidence in you that I never knew any other man, your father excepted, worthy of.—I have a weight on my mind from which you only can relieve me;”—he paused again, and seemed embarrassed. “It is a delicate subject. I hoped—I expected that you would have first spoken to me upon it, but you may have your own scruples—I know not—I am lost in conjectures—at any rate, my frankness demands an equal frankness in return.” “Charles,” he continued with a firmer voice, “it has long been my favourite, almost my only project, to give my child to you—to obtain for myself a virtuous son—to secure to her a safe and happy destiny—your father's generosity impaired your inheritance; Caroline's will supply its defects—my daughter loves you—I do not commit her delicacy in saying so—the sentiment does equal credit to her head and heart —how long it will endure delay on your part I cannot say: she is a flattered and somewhat spoiled beauty—and this Fitzgerald is laying siege to her.” At this moment Westall almost wished he had a heart to give to the daughter of Mr. Redwood, but he did not hesitate as to the course he should pursue: after saying he was certain Mr. Redwood had misunderstood his daughter's sentiments in relation to him, he made a manly avowal of his attachment to Ellen, and related, with such reserves as a lover would be apt to make, the events and conversation of the morning of her departure from Eton. Mr. Redwood was quite unprepared for this communication, for though his acquaintance with Ellen Bruce, and his vigilant observation of Westall, had shaken the dominion of his long cherished dogma of the selfishness of his race, and though he had of late much inclined to believe there were principles that might modify and control this selfishness; yet it seemed to him utterly incredible that a young man without fortune, without patronage, and with talents to generate ambition, should forego the brilliant advantages of an alliance with his daughter, for the sake of pure love, such as he had deemed only existed in romances and poetry, and was almost too obsolete to obtain a place there. He received Westall's disclosure with an intense interest. Admiration for his young friend, and bitter disappointment at the utter defeat of his own projects, struggled for the mastery: he remained silent till Westall said, “you may deem my hopes presumptuous, Sir, but you cannot, I am certain, think them dishonourable to me.” “Dishonourable! no, my dear Charles —my only wonder is that you have fallen in love with a poor little girl who has nothing but the best heart in the world to give you—dishonourable! would to God my youth had been rectified by the principle that governs yours.” Memory and conscience were busy, and sent their witness into Redwood's pallid cheek. “Westall, I am a miserable man—life has no attractions—no consolations for me—death no repose. I had a deep thirst for happiness—my spirit soared above the vulgar pleasures of the world, but I have fettered—wasted—degraded it; and now I suffer the fierce pangs of remorse for the past—of despair for the future. Westall, there is a misery for which language has no expression, in approaching the grave with the consciousness of having lost the noble ends for which life was given. “Had I been borne along, as thousands are, like a leaf upon the waters, and left no trace behind, I should have comparative peace; but”—he folded his hands upon his breast—“I have dispossessed this temple of the divinity for which it was formed, I have destroyed the innocent—contaminated the pure—and my child — my only child — the immortal creature whose destiny was entrusted to me, I have permitted to be nursed in folly, and devoted to the world without a moral principle or influence!” The wild melancholy of Redwood's countenance, and the import of his language, alarmed Westall:—“let me beseech you, Sir,” said he, “to be more composed—your strength is unequal to the agitation of your spirits—you know not what you are saying.” “Not know what I am saying,” he replied, with a bitter smile: “oh, Westall, I am wearied with the dreary solitude of my own mind—the spirit of your father, young man, is in your face—his gentleness in your heart: I must have your sympathy, your aid—if indeed relief is possible. I have sought relief here,” he continued, drawing a Bible from beneath his pillow, “this was the gift of your sweet Ellen. At midnight and in secresy I have explored its pages—and I believe its record is true—at least I am inclined to believe it; but when the evidence of its divine original forces its way to my convictions, the arguments and the ridicule of infidelity recur to my mind, and the habits of scepticism hold it in suspense. And if it be true, its decisions are against me—its promises are all to the pious, the upright, and the benevolent.” “And is there no promise to the penitent?” asked Westall. “Believe me, this book contains the provisions of a father for his children; and there is no condition of the human mind, no modification of human destiny, which they cannot reach.” “Do not, Charles, make me the dupe of my necessities; do not send the light of hope into my mind, to render the darkness that shall succeed more horrible. Of what avail can be that penitence into which we are scourged by the fear of the future? Charles, I have already gone too far with you for half-way confidence, and I have no longer any motive for reserve. As I draw near the limit of life, the opinion of my fellow-men, which has ruled me with despotic control, is reduced to its real insignificance. I ask your patience, while I relate to you some events of my life, of which there is now no record, but that which is written as with the point of a diamond on my conscience.” “You are wearied already with the exertions of this morning,” said Westall, with instinctive delicacy, “had you not better suspend our conversation for the present?” “No, my dear friend, nothing will refresh me so much as unburthening my heart to you.—I have now nerved myself to the effort, and I feel equal to it—I may never again.” He then proceeded to relate the circumstances of his life with which our readers are already acquainted. His narrative was often interrupted by emotions too strong to be repressed; and as he concluded, he said to Westall, who had listened in breathless silence, “you now perceive, Charles, what reason I have for remorse.” “But why,” asked Westall, stimulated by a governing feeling of compassion to suggest something that might alleviate Mr. Redwood's misery, “why this deep remorse? Your life has been stained but by one criminal action, and that committed in the thoughtless period of youth.” “Ah, Charles! do not soften matters to me now—that one action has cast its dark shadows over every period of my life: say you one criminal action? what call you my total neglect of my daughter? what that cold indifference to the happiness of the human family which has permitted me to lock those talents in my own breast, which might have been employed for their benefit?—what kind term will you bestow on my cold scepticism? what on my useless, daring speculations? No no, my friend,” he added, impetuously, “you must not—cannot flatter me now—it is too late—I have learned truly to estimate the barrenness, the misery of that life which has no higher objects of pursuit than those that perish in the using. I must endure the effects of that folly which passes by the pure fountains of happiness in the path of life, and of that selfishness which makes a dreary desert of the world. “I was made for something better than a man of the world. This consciousness, which has never forsaken me, has sharpened the sting of conscience, and has made me probably suffer more and enjoy less, than most men would have done in my circumstances. Do not reply to me now, Charles. You are in no state of mind to give me the counsel and aid I so much need. I perceive the compassionate interest that I have awakened, and am grateful for it. Once I should have scorned it, but now it is balm to my hurt mind. “With my present feelings, Westall, you will not be surprised at my anxiety to make all the amends in my power to my daughter for my neglect of her. I am not blind to her faults—they are, alas! too glaring not to be seen; but I hoped every thing from her youth and the influence of your character; and I thought, and still think, that she has a deeper interest in you than I believed her capable of feeling in any one. But that is all past—it was my last dream— you have chosen well. I cannot boast my principles—but Ellen suits my tastes; and feeling her loveliness as I have felt it, I cannot now but wonder that I ever should have indulged the extravagant expectation that you would fix your affections elsewhere. Charles, your sweet friend resembles the only person I ever truly loved: resembles her in her face and figure, and still more in the gentleness and purity of her character. Oh, had I possessed such a child! —poor Caroline! The world would wonder, Westall, if it knew that the beautiful idol to whom it renders homage is the object of her father's pity—of his remorse—but I forget your interests in my perpetual recurrence to my own anxieties. “You must persuade Ellen to give up her scruples in regard to her mother's restrictions; there can be but one rational opinion about them. She was doubtless some sentimental deluded young creature, whose tenderness for her offspring induced her to devise this innocent little artifice to keep her in ignorance of her parentage.” Westall had too entire a sympathy with Ellen to regard the matter in this light, but he declared with sincerity, that though on her account he trusted VOL. III. F that her long cherished hopes might not be disappointed, as far as related to his own feelings, the result would be a matter of perfect indifference. “No parentage,” he said, “could confer honour on Miss Bruce—none could touch the essential dignity of her character.” Mr. Redwood smiled at his enthusiasm; but he respected it. He entreated Westall to give him as much of his time as possible; `he knew,' he said, `that it would be a sacrifices to him, but he believed that sacrifices were neither difficult nor painful to those who were habitually disinterested.' Mr. Redwood expressed the greatest anxiety in regard to Fitzgerald's attentions to his daughter. He said he had learned that this gentleman was a younger branch of a noble family, turned into the army to seek his fortune in a military life, for which he had no other qualifications than a fine figure and handsome face—and that moreover he was distinguished among the officers of his regiment for his dissipated habits. These were certainly sufficient grounds of alarm; and they increased now to a frightful degree the harassed and troubled state of mind which seemed to be hastening Mr. Redwood to the grave. At one moment he resolved to leave the Springs immediately, and the next was convinced that he was unequal to the effort. Westall remained with him until summoned away by the dinner bell; he then left him somewhat tranquillized, and with the resolution that he would spare no efforts to minister to the peace of his mind. Such was the benevolent interest he felt in him, that he would have compassed sea and land to inspire him with a just hope and a quiet resignation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">F 2 CHAPTER XX. “Call you this a quiz?” said my uncle, “in my day it would have been called a lie.” Plain Dealer. Miss Campbell valued herself on never feeling or doing any thing by halves—she had taken a decided liking to Ellen—with her cordial admiration there mingled a little of the pride of a discoverer: a complacent sense of the merit of having first felt Miss Bruce's attractions, and asserted her claims. She attached herself almost exclusively to her, and Westall was delighted to observe after dinner that Ellen, instead of retiring immediately to her own room as usual, accompanied Miss Campbell and her party to the drawing-room. Miss Redwood observed that he was following them—she beckoned to him and said, “be good enough to tell Miss Deborah, that during my ride this morning I met her neighbour Martin, I stopped him to enquire after the Lenoxes. He told me they were all well excepting old Mrs. Allen, who is very ill, and afraid she shall not live to see her grandchild.” Westall went as unwillingly as ever schoolboy crept to school to deliver a message which must hasten Ellen's departure. Fitzgerald had overheard the communication, and looked at Caroline inquisitively. “A ruse de guerre,” she whispered. “It is such a bore to meet that giant Miss Deb by and her suite at every turn, that I have tasked my invention to get rid of them.” “Oh, a quiz, admirable—skill against ignorance—the only mode of warfare with savages. 'Pon honour, Miss Redwood, I cannot imagine how you have survived your exile among those barbarians. The condition of society in these northern states is quite terrible—insufferable to those whose felicity it has been to live where the natural distinctions of rank are preserved.” “I assure you, Captain Fitzgerald, I was excessively annoyed. I found it quite impossible to make those people feel they were not my equals.” “Your equals! good heavens! had the animals `organs, senses, affections, passions'! Would to heaven,” he added, lowering his voice, “Miss Redwood would consent to go where the eye and the heart will confess that she has no equal.” “That would be heaven, indeed!” replied Caroline, turning her eye on Fitzgerald with an expression that authorised his most daring hopes. “Yes, heaven,” he replied, “not a puritanical heaven of liberty and equality, but a place where beauty, rank, and fashion, are far above this plebeian fog—a place worthy of you, Miss Redwood, where there are queens, and subjects, and worshippers—love and loyalty.” It is impossible to say how long the captain would have continued his battery, had not his fluency been suddenly checked by one of those provoking interruptions to which all lovers are liable. Mrs. Westall, to whom Mr. Redwood (too ill to appear at dinner) had consigned his daughter, tired of playing solitaire with his fair protegée, was all eye and ear for Fitzgerald, and deaf and dumb to every body else, took the liberty to remark that all the ladies except themselves had retired from the table, and rising at the same moment, she proposed to Caroline an adjournment to the drawing-room. Miss Redwood would rather have deferred the movement, for she dreaded encountering Deborah. “Come with us,” she whispered to Fitzgerald, who stood awaiting with deference the ladies' departure: “if we are obliged to meet the old amazon, heaven help us! We shall need all our combined skill to parry her downright questions.” “As your auxiliary, Miss Redwood,” replied Fitzgerald, proceeding towards the drawing-room with the ladies, “I fear nothing: but upon my soul, without a divinity to inspire me, I should never muster courage to encounter one of these question-asking Yankees. I had rather march up to the cannon's mouth.” “Thank heaven,” said Caroline, casting her eyes around the drawing-room, and ascertaining that Deborah was not there, “we are safe for the present. If you will open the piano for me, Captain Fitzgerald, I will play the air you were asking for this morning.” Captain Fitzgerald arranged the piano —Miss Redwood took her seat at it, and Mrs. Westall left her and joined Ellen, who was sitting on the other side of the room in an animated conversation with Grace Campbell. “Your fair friend, Mrs. Westall,” said Miss Campbell, “has certainly made a conquest of Captain Fitzgerald—a conquest that I suspect will lead very soon to an amicable treaty.” “Appearances justify your opinion, certainly,” replied Mrs. Westall; “and provided Mr. Redwood ratifies the treaty, I know no one that will interpose, or even feel an objection.” “I don't know,” said Miss Campbell, “I have no particular admiration for Miss Redwood; but I declare to you, I think she is too young and too beautiful to be sacrificed to a mere fortune-hunter.” “She is heartless,” replied Mrs. Westall, “and therefore fair game for a fortune-hunter.” F 3 Charles Westall noticed that his mother spoke with uncommon asperity; but her gentlest tones had never delighted him so much, as an expression that indicated a state of feeling which he had long hoped that her own observation and reflections would produce without his interference. He perceived that she was completely alienated from Miss Redwood, and that the re-action of her feelings was all in Ellen's favour, and with a very pardonable filial enthusiasm, he mentally congratulated himself on always having believed that his mother's good sense and good feeling would finally rectify her opinions. Probably Ellen's thoughts had received a direction from Mrs. Westall's observation; but suddenly recalling them to the point whence they had started, she asked Miss Campbell “if she thought Fitzgerald was really in love with Caroline Redwood?” “In love!—Oh my sweet innocent, in what blessed ignorance of the present generation you must have lived. In love—no, believe me there is no love extant, unless it be,” and she glanced her laughing eyes with most provoking significance towards Westall, “unless it be on the shores of romantic lakes, or in such sweet sequestered vales as you describe that in which your friend Mrs. Harrison resides—Fitzgerald in love!— his device is a golden arrow—his motto, the old proverb—`Without Ceres and Bacchus, love is cold.”' “Shame on you, Grace,” said young Armstead, “you are a most ungracious girl. You should adopt the mode of some pretty simpering fair ones of my acquaintance, who imitate bereaved widows, and always speak of their late lovers as they do of their deceased husbands with a `poor dear' prefixed to their names. `Poor dear Fitzgerald' would be a becoming mention of one of your most devoted worshippers.” “It was to the golden trappings of the idol that Fitzgerald bowed, William: his sacrifice was like the priests of Baal, the fire came not near it.” “You may carry your analogy still farther, Grace; for to your praise be it spoken, there was `no voice, nor answer, nor any that regarded.”' “I deserve no praise for that,” replied Miss Campbell, while a smile betrayed that she was not displeased to have it known that she disdained the flatteries of Miss Redwood's admirer: “I deserve no praise for seeing through that soulless creature—a mere parade-day officer, who dishonours the uniform that has been and is worn by so many heroes You and I, William, were brought up in the old school, nursed in Anglo-American prejudices, taught to believe that all virtue, valour, genius, were of British birth and growth: experience has abated some of the articles of my creed, and softened others. I have seen many an American shop-boy, many a gawky young farmer, who had more cleverness than such a British officer as Fitzgerald: more knowledge, more of every thing that is essentially respectable.” “You are so enlightened, Miss Campbell,” said Westall, “you should disabuse some of your fair countrywomen of their prejudices.” “It is impossible, utterly impossible. Such an enterprise would be as rational as a crusade against artificial flowers and ostrich feathers. So long as these red-coated gentry shall play the most elegant game at chess, or whist—hand a lady to the dinner table in the most graceful manner—carve the dish next her secundum artem, and in short, perform all the little etiquettes of society with unparalleled grace, they must remain the favourite ornaments of our drawing-rooms —our fair ladies will overlook their little irregularities in morals; and rational and virtuous men, like you, Mr. Westall, and my cousin William, (you do not merit the compliment from me, Will, but I put you in to make the party stronger,) such men must yield to them the precedence.” “Oh, Grace!” said Mrs. Armstead, “little did I ever expect to hear such a philippic against any thing British from the lips of one of your grandfather's descendants.” “My dear aunt, you mistake me if you imagine that I mean to limit my criticisms to our foreign military beaus —no, unfortunately we have a large class of native productions that have equal claims to a polished exterior, and essential good-for-nothingness. If my dear grandpapa could take a peep into my heart at this moment, he would be quite satisfied with the loyal affection I bear to the land of his birth; and I flatter myself that the old gentleman, belonging as he doubtless does now to the universal nation of the good and happy, would rejoice that his descendants are all Americans, and only attached to the parent land by the indissoluble ties of respect and affection. I do not believe that we `love Cæsar less,' but we certainly `love Rome more.”' “Well, my dear Grace,” replied Mrs. Armstead, “I am glad to find that if you have caught the national enthusiasm, the epidemic of the day, you are not a traitor to England.” “So far from it, mother,” said young Armstead, “that I will hazard a prophecy, that within six months from this fifteenth day of August, our cousin Grace will be the wife of an Englishman.” “You are a false prophet, Will.” “Time, not you, Grace, must pronounce that decision; and I call this honourable company to witness that I rest my prophetic fame upon this prediction.” By a natural train of thought Mr. Howard, whom Ellen had seen devoted to Miss Campbell when they met at the village-inn, occurred to her mind, and she asked Grace, `why he was not still of her party?' “He was suddenly summoned away,” she replied, “by letters from home:” and, to avert observation from her rising colour, she looked out of the window. “I stand to my prediction, Grace,” whispered Armstead, “in spite of your treacherous blushes.” “Mr. Westall,” exclaimed Miss Campbell, “you were inquiring for Deborah, here she comes with the little shaker.” “For mercy's sake, Miss Campbell,” said Ellen, “do not let Emily hear you call her so. The poor child has been frightened to death since Miss Redwood's address to her this morning made her an object of notice. Her story is now, I am told, though fortunately she does not know it, in every body's mouth.” Westall met Deborah at the door, and drew her aside to communicate Miss Redwood's message. Emily entered the room alone, and looked fearfully around her. “Poor little timid distressed thing,” said Miss Campbell, “she looks like a lamb that has strayed from the shepherd into a company of wolves.” Ellen advanced towards the bashful girl, and drawing Emily's arm within her own, she led her to a seat where she was sheltered from observation. Westall qualified the information he reluctantly communicated to Deborah, and urged that one day's delay could not be of consequence. She, however, with her usual promptitude, determined to leave the Springs the next morning, and immediately announced her determination to her companions, without deeming it necessary to avow the cause of it. A bright beam of pleasure shot from Emily's eyes. Ellen's turned involuntarily towards Charles Westall, and one brief glance contradicted all her well-maintained reserve and scrupulous silence. Loud exclamations, expressive of disappointment, from all the Armstead party, and, louder than all the rest, Miss Campbell's, attracted a momentary attention from Miss Redwood. She paused in the midst of the successful performance of a favourite march, and exchanged a significant nod with Fitzgerald; she then struck the notes with a stronger hand, but she could not drown the unwelcome sounds of `do, Miss Bruce, stay one day longer—Oh, Miss Debby, one day cannot make any difference—just one day.' But Miss Deborah, affirming that it had all along been her intention to go within a day or two, remained inexorable, and the young ladies left the drawing-room to arrange their affairs for their departure. Mrs. Westall followed Ellen to the stairs, and detaining her there till her companions had passed up, she said, “if my feelings or wishes have ever done you injustice, forgive me, Ellen—believe me, there is now but one other so dear—so interesting to me as you are.” Ellen faltered out, “I am very grateful,” and turned hastily away, leaving Mrs. Westall quite satisfied with the significance which her glowing cheek and moistened eye gave to her scanty expression. Ellen had scarcely reached her own apartment, when Miss Campbell came running to her quite out of breath: “suspend your packing operations, my dear Ellen,” she said, “and sit down and listen to me for a moment, I cannot be ceremonious with you—I have the greatest favour to ask of you—and you cannot, must not deny me. Will you remain here for ten days as my guest? I bar a negative. Now do not make up your mouth for any excuses till you have heard me out. You told me this morning that your old friend Mrs. Allen no longer needed your services, and that you were only going this roundabout way to Vermont, because you had no other way of getting to Mrs. Harrison. Now my aunt is going to Boston—she has a vacant seat in her carriage—Lansdown is but a few miles off the direct route, and my aunt says nothing will delight her so much as to take you to Mrs. Harrison. She bids me tell you that Mrs. Harrison was an acquaintance of her mother's, and that you must not refuse her an introduction to her.” Ellen's decision vibrated between a strong inclination to remain and a natural reluctance (which even Miss Campbell's extreme cordiality could not remove,) to receive such favours from persons nearly strangers to her. While she deliberated, and Grace Campbell urged her request, they were interrupted by a servant who brought Ellen a note. “This note, whoever it comes from,” said Miss Campbell, “will, I trust, induce you to decide to remain. You seem now as much puzzled as poor Launcelot Gobbo was with the opposing counsel of the fiend and his conscience. Conscience is on my side I am sure.” “And the note too,” said Ellen, refolding it; “and now if Miss Deborah will relinquish her right to me, I will throw away all squeamishness, and gratefully accept your invitation.” The note was from Mr. Redwood, and contained an earnest entreaty that Ellen would defer her departure for a few days. It was written hastily, was almost illegible, and concluded thus: “I once meditated an injury against you— it is now my earnest wish to repair the fault of that intention—my life is fast ebbing—do not refuse the last favour I can ever ask of you.” The note Ellen rightly believed was the fruit of Westall's intervention, but he could not have dictated the purport of it, and her delicacy was satisfied, now that she had a motive to remain, independent of her lover. The ladies proceeded to Miss Deborah's apartment, and she, having heard the proposed arrangement, acquiesced with her usual rationality. She seated herself on her trunk, and resting her elbows on her knees. “Not but what I am loth to part with you, Ellen,” she said, “for the Lord knows,” and she brushed a tear from the corner of her eye, “nobody ever wanted to leave you yet; but then there is reason in all things—you have taken a long journey, all for those that's neither kith nor kin to you, and now that you are happy among your mates, it is but fair you should have a play-spell: besides, it would be rather tough for our poor old horse to draw us all over the hills, and he should be considered too—to be sure I calculated to walk up the hills, but then I have come to that time of life, when I had rather ride than walk— so all is for the best.” “We can all say `amen' to that, Miss Deborah,” said Miss Campbell; “you are a perfect philosopher. I am delighted—Ellen looks resigned—and your little Emily there most provokingly happy.” “Well,” replied Debby, “contentment is a good thing, and a rare—but I guess it dwells most where people would least expect to find it. There's Ellen Bruce, she has had troubles that would fret some people to death, and yet I have seldom seen her with a cloudy face.” “How do you account for that, Miss Debby? I am curious to get at this secret of happiness; for I have been in great straits sometimes, for the want of it.” “Why, I'll tell you. Now, Ellen, I don't mean to praise you”—and she looked at Ellen, while an expression of affection spread over her rough featured face. “The truth is, Ellen has been so busy about making other people happy, that she has no time to think of herself; instead of grieving about her own troubles, she has tried to lessen other people's; instead of talking about her own feelings and thinking about them, you would not know she had any, if you did not see she always knew just how other people felt.” “Stop, stop, Deborah, my good friend,” said Ellen, “you must not turn flatterer in your old age.” “Flatterer!—The Lord have mercy on you, girl; nothing was farther from my thoughts than flattering. I mean just to tell this young lady, for her information, that the secret of happiness was to forget yourself, and care for the happiness of others.” “You are right—I believe you are right,” said Miss Campbell, with animation; “though I have practised very little after your golden rule.” “The more's the pity, young woman; for, depend on't, it's the safe rule and the sure; I have scriptur warrant for it, beside my own observation, which, as you may judge, has not been small. It's a strange thing this happiness; it puts me in mind of an old Indian I have heard of, who said to a boy, who was begging him for a bow and arrow, `the more you say bow and arrow, the more I won't make it.' There's poor Mr. Redwood, as far as I can find out, he has had nothing all his life to do but to go up and down and too and fro upon the earth, in search of happiness; look at his face, it is as sorrowful as a tombstone, and just makes you ponder upon what has been, and what might have been: and his kickshaw of a daughter —why I, Debby Lenox, a lone old woman that I am, would not change VOL. III. G places with her—would not give up my peaceable feelings for hers, for all the gold in the king's coffers: and for the most part, since I have taken a peep into what's called the world, I have seen little to envy among the great and the gay, the rich and handsome.” “And yet, Miss Debby,” said Grace, “the world looks upon these as the privileged classes.” “Ah! the world is the slave of its own fooleries.” “Well, Miss Deborah, I have unbounded confidence in your wisdom; but, since my lot is cast in this same evil world, I should be sorry to think there was no good in it.” “No good, Miss!—that was what I did not, and would not say. There is good in every thing and every where, if we have but eyes to see it, and hearts to confess it. There is some pure gold mixed with all this glitter; some here that seem to have as pure hearts and quiet minds as if they had never stood in the dazzling sunshine of fortune.” “You mean to say, Deborah,” said Ellen, “that contentment is a modest, prudent spirit; and that for the most part she avoids the high places of the earth, where the sun burns and the tempests beat, and leads her favourites along quiet vales and to sequestered fountains.” “Just what I would have said, Ellen, though it may not be just as I should have said it,” replied Deborah, smiling. “You young folks like to dress every thing off with garlands, while such a plain old body as I only thinks of the substantials. But here I am preaching, while Emily, as busy as a little bee, has packed every thing and tied every bundle and box; her heart is already half way to Eton. I wish it was as short a journey to my old limbs as it is for your young spirits, Emily. Now don't redden up, child, like the sky G 2 at sunset: true love is a creditable feeling, and I hope you know it to be so now that we have sifted that shaker chaff out of your mind. Come, Miss Campbell and Ellen, we will go on to the piazza, and leave Emily to the company of her own thoughts.” The young ladies followed Deborah to the piazza. Mr. Redwood and his daughter, Fitzgerald and Westall, were sitting at one extremity of it. Deborah proposed joining them; but Ellen begged they might remain where they were. “I cannot,” she said, “voluntarily inflict my presence on Miss Redwood. I never approach her that she does not shrink from me as if I breathed a poisonous influence.” “Or rather,” said Miss Campbell, “as a condemned spirit shrinks from the healthful air of morning. She is not worth heeding, Ellen: it is the folly of her haughtiness, or perhaps,”—and she looked at Ellen with an arch smile— “there has been some rivalry in the case; she may have detected too soon the `fair speechless messages that pass between certain eyes and yours. Do not colour, dear Ellen; Miss Debby says truly, `it is a creditable feeling.”' “Spare your raillery, Grace; this is no subject for it. There is no rivalry in the case, I assure you. Whatever my feelings may be, you perceive that all Miss Redwood's are now exclusively devoted to Captain Fitzgerald; and yet her dislike towards me, or rather hatred, for I must give it that harsh name, has no relenting.—I never approach her—I never pass her, even in her happiest moods, that her brow does not contract, and every feature becomes rigid, with an expression that it would seem impossible for so young and beautiful a face to wear.” “Pshaw, Ellen!” said Deborah; “the girl is whimsical, and her whims are no more worth your minding than the freaks of a fretful child. Come along with us. I must see Mr. Redwood once more, and sorry am I it's the last time, for he suits my fancy better than many a better man.” Ellen seemed still reluctant, when Charles Westall joined the ladies with a request, as he said, from Mr. Redwood, that they would consider his inability to come to them, and favour him with their company. The ladies acquiesced, and Miss Campbell took Deborah's arm, on the pretext that she could not accommodate her quick step to Ellen's lagging pace. This benevolent manœuvre gave Westall an opportunity to satisfy his impatient curiosity as to Ellen's decision in regard to her departure, and when they reached Mr. Redwood, the speaking animation of his countenance evinced how much he was delighted with the result of his enquiry. Miss Redwood stood with her back to the company, apparently entirely engrossed in settling with Captain Fitzgerald the comparative beauty of the liveries of half-a-dozen servants who stood at the spring below them. A faint gleam of pleasure lit up Mr. Redwood's pale and desponding face, as Ellen approached him; he took her hand. “Miss Deborah,” he said, “is very good to consent to leave you.” Caroline turned suddenly round, and darted a look of eager inquiry at Ellen. “And you, my dear Miss Bruce,” he added, in a low voice, “very kind to grant my poor request.” “Caroline, Miss Bruce remains a few days longer at Lebanon, I hope you will do every thing in your power to prove that her stay is not a matter of indifference to you.” Caroline bowed—she looked absolutely pale. “Your favourite book, my dear Ellen,” continued Mr. Redwood, “asserts, I believe, that it is more blessed to give than to receive; if so, I shall be the cause of great happiness to you, though not in a mode most flattering to my own pride.” Every word that her father uttered increased Caroline's agitation; it was too apparent to escape observation, and for once the same thought flashed through Fitzgerald's and Miss Campbell's mind—the same thought, but it produced a very different effect. “Good heavens,” said Miss Campbell mentally, “does the foolish girl really fancy that her poor father, who is so fast going where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage, is projecting a love-match with Ellen, or that she will marry a half disembodied spirit!” `Ah,' thought Fitzgerald, `the girl is keen-sighted, she foresees a match—these second marriages make horrible havoc with fortunes.' Mr. Redwood charged Deborah with many kind remembrances to his Vermont friends, and she, really affected at the thought of parting from him for ever, and always unobservant of forms, turned hastily away without saying a word to Caroline. Suddenly recollecting herself she returned. “Good bye to you, Miss Caroline,” she said, “the Lord bless you, and make you a blessing and a comfort to your father, which he much needs; and don't,” she added in a whisper, “don't do any thing to fret him, for his life hangs as it were, by a cambric thread; and oh, now I think of it,” and she checked herself as she was again turning away, “I thank you heartily for remembering John Martin's errand to me, it was very thoughtful of you—and I assure you, Miss Caroline, though my memory is something broken, I never can forget a kindness.” Mr. Redwood was evidently gratified with the good nature which led Deborah to magnify a trifling courtesy “My dear Caroline,” he said, “I am glad that you have had an opportunity of G 3 obliging Miss Deborah—where did you see John Martin?” “Oh, I have not seen him at all,” replied Caroline, making an effort to shelter her mortification by a careless laugh. “Only a quiz upon Miss Debby, papa —a merry thought of mine, which I know you will forgive, since it has led to an indefinite postponement of Miss Bruce's departure.—Captain Fitzgerald, you promised to shew me the setting sun from the hill—a pretty view I am told— have you ever seen it, Miss Campbell? Farewell, Miss Deborah.” Miss Redwood walked away with Captain Fitzgerald with apparent unconcern. This was not the first time that Caroline had shewn, in pressing emergencies, a perfect self-command, though on slight occasions she was a very child in exposing every shade of passion. “I hope all you good rational people,” said Mr. Redwood with a sigh, “will remember that my child is but eighteen; and now may I beg a few moments' private conversation with Miss Bruce?” “A few moments, certainly,” replied Miss Campbell: “come, Mr. Westall, I challenge you to a turn on the piazza, and we will see which bears privation with most magnanimity.” “Do you believe the old gentleman is really going to make love to Miss Bruce?” asked Grace Campbell, as she turned away. “Not on his own account, I fancy,” replied Westall. “Ah, I comprehend—but depend on it, a love cause is better in the hands of the principal than the most eloquent agent.” And so it proved; for though Mr. Redwood frankly avowed to Ellen the disappointment of his own hopes, and though he urged her with all the energy of strong feeling and the most affectionate interest, to waive her scruples— though he begged on his own account, that before he died he might have the happiness of seeing the two persons in whom he felt the strongest interest united: it was not till Westall, availing himself of an opportunity that occurred in the evening to plead his own cause with the irresistible zeal of true and well-requited love, that Ellen gave her promise—that she would write to Mrs. Harrison—lay the case before her, and abide by her decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. ———“Thou I find Hast the true tokens of a noble mind, But the world wins thee.” Crabbe. Miss Campbell and Ellen rose by appointment on the following morning, at the dawn of day, that they might witness the departure of Deborah and Emily. As they all stood on the piazza, awaiting the arrangement of the baggage in the chaise, Deborah drew Ellen aside. “Look here,” she said, undrawing a bag and discovering one corner of a pacquet, “here is the identical money you refused to receive from Mr. Redwood; he sent it to me last night for a marriage-portion for Emily: it is true, child—God bless him—it is true—he has given it, and I have taken it with a thankful heart and a prayer (as in duty bound) that the Lord would return it to him a hundred fold, in something better than silver and gold. I shall keep the present a secret till Emily's wedding-day, which I'm sure is not far off; and Ellen,” she added, after a moment's pause, “I'm thinking that another wedding-day is coming among our friends. Now what do you look down for? If there is any body in the land might hold up their heads with a good grace, it's you; for to my notion there is not a nobler man in 'varsal world, view him in what light you will, than this same Charles Westall.” “But, Deborah,” interrupted Ellen, “I am not”— “Engaged—I know that”— “Ma'am, your chaise is ready,” said the servant. “Coming in a minute. I know how it stands, Ellen, pretty nearly; for last night, when I got this pacquet from Redwood, my heart was so full I thought I could not sleep till I had told you. I looked in your room — you was not there; I came on to the piazza—you and Mr. Charles Westall were standing by the door yonder; while I was hesitating whether to go back without interrupting you, I heard a few words, just enough to give me a little insight into the business. I thought it fair to tell you; and besides, I wanted to charge you not to be notional; for a girl of your sense, Ellen, you are apt to be a little notional, which is not your fault, but comes of your living with Mrs. Harrison, and reading too many verses, which are apt to make girls dreamy.” “Miss Debby,” cried Emily, “every thing is ready, and the sun is rising.” “Coming child, coming. One word more, Ellen—” and here Deborah paused, for the first time in her life at a loss how to express herself. She drummed with the butt end of her whip on the railing, made figures with the lash on the floor, knit her brow, bit her lips, but did not speak till spurred by a second call from Emily; and then the tears gushed from the good creature's eyes as she said, “Ellen, you are rich in nothing but the grace of God; the best riches I know: but then there's neither quails nor manna now-a-days, and one must look a little to the needful. When my father died, (a thrifty prudent man) he left me fifty pounds lawful. It has been in good hands, and has run up to between two and three hundred. I have enough for myself besides, Ellen, laid up for a wet day, so that is all to be yours. Now don't speak, but hearken to me—besides the money, I have a nice store of table linen for you, and some coverlits, and feather beds.” “Oh Deborah, Deborah!”— “Say nothing, child—I can't bear it. I won't be gainsayed. Good bye, Ellen, the Lord bless you, child, and all that care for you,”—and she strided across the piazza without giving Ellen time to open her lips; shook Miss Campbell's hand heartily as she passed, took her seat in the chaise, and the moment Emily had taken a hurried leave of Ellen, she drove off, followed by the blessings and prayers of her grateful young friend. The two ladies stood silently gazing after the old chaise as it slowly descended the hill. After a few moments, Miss Campbell turned suddenly round, and observing that the tears were streaming from Ellen's eyes, “who would think,” she said, “that Miss Deborah would call forth such a sentimental tribute; and yet I could find it in my heart to cry heartily too, for sure I am, I never shall look upon her like again.” “She deserves every tribute,” replied Ellen, “that can be paid to genuine worth. Under her rough exterior she bears a heart that angels might joy to look into—full of all honest thoughts and kindly affections.” “Yes, I believe you; and now, dear Ellen, though more than half an angel yourself, I am going to expose a heart to you that has no such high qualifications; so get your hat and shawl, and we will stroll into some of these woods, far out of the sight and hearing of the `world's people.' The two ladies ascended the hill above the spring, and leaving the highway, took a foot-path that indents a beautiful grove. They soon reached a place of perfect seclusion, and seating themselves on a rock, they remained for some time silent; Ellen awaiting Miss Campbell's communication, and she with some embarrassment picking the leaves from a branch she had plucked in her way, and strewing them about her: at last, throwing away leaves, branch, and all, she said, “I hardly know, Ellen, whether to be most ashamed or proud of myself, on account of the confidence I am about to repose in you. It seems so like the girlish prating of a Miss in her teens; after our brief acquaintance to unveil to you the state of my heart, when even I myself have not yet dared to take one calm survey of it. But there is a charm about you, Ellen—an `open sessime' that unlocks all hearts—you have touched the master-spring of mine, and it must be shown to you as it is, with all its light and all its darkness: believe me, you will find it “o'er good for banning, and o'er bad for blessing.” “Well, dear Miss Campbell, do dispense with any more preparation; I have already felt such sweet and kindly influence from this unknown country, that I long to explore it.” “Will you pay my frankness in kind, Ellen? Never mind—do not blush; I see you belong to the sentimental class, who never tell their love, and I will be generous and tell you all; and, perhaps, you will be just and tell me—all that I have not already guessed. “To begin then with the beginning. I might almost use the concise style of a certain ludicrous personage and say, `I was born and up I grew'—but that there were circumstances that occurred in our family, in my youth, which affected my character and relations in life. My father was a lawyer, a man of talents, and rising rapidly in his profession when he was carried off by the yellow fever, then raging in our city. I was but a month old when he died. My mother took refuge among the Moravians in Bethlem. The sudden death of my father blasted her happiness and hopes; and the fatigue of removal, so soon after her confinement, threw her into a decline; she languished two years, and then followed my father. The Moravian sisters had attended to all her wants with exemplary devotion. My helpless infancy had interested their kind hearts; I was exclusively attached to them, and as my aunt Armstead was then engrossed with a plentifully stocked nursery, and I had no other near female relative, my friends were easily persuaded to permit me to remain under the care of one of the sisters of Bethlem. “When I was ten years old, my uncle Richard Campbell, who was my guardian, came to see me; he was then, and still is, a bachelor; he is a merchant, and has amassed a large fortune, all, as I am told, in a very regular way of trade, and by the faithful application of every maxim in poor Richard's almanac. He was my father's eldest brother; had courted in his youth a very charming young girl, who preferred and married his younger brother, a poor helpless genius. This disappointment inclined my uncle Richard to distrust our whole sex, one of them having made such an erroneos calculation as to the main chance, and he is said never to have jeoparded his fortune by offering to participate it with any other lady. His younger brother, and successful rival, abandoned his country and went to England, in the hope of carrying his literary talents to a better market than he could find for them at home. There he had small successes and great discouragements; and, after struggling a few years, he died and left his wife unprovided with every thing but three or four children, rather an unproductive property you know. She preferred remaining in England to returning, to be either a dependent on her friends or a reproach to them; and with the aid of occasional remittances from my good aunt Armstead, and some little remnant of her father's estate, and with faculties of industry and economy in her situation deserving of all praise, she contrived to subsist and educate her family respectably. Her eldest son is said to be a genius, a painter by profession, and a man of sense; but of him more anon. “My uncle Richard preserved towards the poor widow of his brother the resentment of a mean mind; and there is, as far as I know, no reason to believe that in all her embarrassments he ever extended to her the slightest aid. As I told you, when my uncle first saw me I was ten years old, a little prim miniature old maid, dressed in the formal fashion of the Moravians, as staid in my deportment, and as precise in all my movements, as the good ancient maiden who had formed me after her own model. In short, I was my uncle's beau ideal. He was just then meditating a selection of some one of his young relations to inherit his property—of some one who by the hardest slavery, the slavery of the mind, the complete subjection of the will, might deserve the rich inheritance he has to bestow. Most unfortunately for him and for me, his choice fell upon myself: unfortunate for both, for if there ever existed two beings who had not one principle of affinity, they are my uncle and myself. He is a conceited bigot in every thing, from his religion down to his particular mode of tying on his neckcloth; he is ignorant of every thing but how to get and how to keep money: in short, dear Ellen, for his character is not worth the drawing, the breath of intellectual and moral life has never been breathed into him.” “And is this the uncle, Miss Campbell, whose fortune you are to inherit?” inquired Ellen. “The same, my dear—and do not suspect me of ingratitude. I have faults enough, heaven knows, but ingratitude is not one of them—a good word, a kind look, were never thrown away upon me; but I owe my uncle nothing. He selected an heir, because he chose to control his property as long as possible; and he selected me, because he fancied that I should prove an obedient machine, a meek subject to his will.” “You must have convinced him of his mistake long before this,” said Ellen; “how have you retained his favour?” “Oh, he is completely enlightened, my dear; but, luckily for my worldly prospects, he prides himself on never changing his purpose. But I have gone beyond my story. He took me home with him, placed me at a public school, where I had companions of my own age, and I soon lost the quiet deportment that had been the effect of the law of imitation, and all the orderly virtues that had been produced by careful pruning and training. I was like a plant transferred from the cellar to the genial influences of air, sunshine, and showers. My uncle had scarcely announced his decision to the world, and pronounced his infallible opinion of my merits, before I was transformed into a gay, Vol. iii. h laughing, romping, reckless child. Figure to yourself, my dear Ellen, such a child, with all the uproar and misrule that follows in her train, introduced into the house of a sober citizen, a priggish old bachelor, with as much Pharisaical exactness in the arrangement of his household and furniture as if his salvation depended on preserving the mutual relation of chairs and tables. “His servants were always in my interest, for I was generous to them to the extent of my ability, and they contrived so to shelter and excuse my faults, that my uncle endured my residence with him for two years; then on one unlucky, or rather lucky day, since I may date from it my escape from thraldom, as I was returning from school with a troop of my young friends, I met old Dickey, a blind fiddler, who used to patrole the streets led by his dog, and who was the familiar friend of every child in the city. We were near my uncle's door; I was in the humour of a frolic, and thoughtless of the consequences, I invited Dickey in, pressed my companions to follow—we ejected the chairs and tables from the parlour, and in five minutes were dancing as merrily as ever fairies tripped it over a green. In the height of our mirth, my uncle entered to witness the horrible sacrilege to which his immaculate parlour was devoted. Children, Dickey, dog, and all, were instantly sent packing. I followed in their train, full of resentment at the indignity that had been offered to me by such treatment of my guests, and heroically resolved never to enter my uncle's house again. I went to my aunt Armstead's, and poured my wrongs into her kind bosom. She, no doubt, saw that my folly surpassed my uncle's severity, but she is the most indulgent being in the world— she had an excessive partiality for me, and without reprimanding me very severely, she took the prudent H 2 resolution to go to my uncle, and represent to him the absolute necessity, for his own comfort, as well as my prosperity, of placing me under female surveillance. She proposed taking charge of me herself, and in pleading my cause she paid such deference to my uncle's will and whims, that she obtained her point without much difficulty—indeed I believe, if the truth were known, the quiet angels in Heaven were not more rejoiced to be rid of the rebel spirit and his misguided followers, than my uncle was to be relieved from me and the little mob that was for ever at my heels. “In my aunt's family I have lived in indulgence so unbounded, that it would have been ruinous to me, but for the salutary influence of those domestic affections, which next to the control and regulation of principle, are certainly the best security for virtue. I could sketch my own character, my dear Ellen, but I am afraid I should not much like to look at the picture. I have had what the French call grand succés in the world, and yet I am more than half wearied with it— at least when I am beyond the syren sounds of pleasure I can feel an anchorite's contempt for it. I have been at the very head of society in Philadelphia—I may say it to you, because it is evidently no merit in your eyes; you care for none of these things. I had rivals who excelled me in every particular attraction of a fine lady—many that were far richer than I could hope to be, some that were far handsomer than my glass, my vanity, or even my flatterers told me that I was—some that I felt to be far wittier, and some that I knew to be much more accomplished,— but I united more than any one of them all. I had not beauty enough to be that most insipid of all creatures, a mere belle— nor literature enough to fall into that unhappy class, the blue stockings, the terror of our city beaux, the dread of our fashionables — nor sufficiently brilliant expectations to throw me into the vulgar class of the fortunes; but I had enough of each to attract the votaries of every class—I have been surrounded by admirers, and yet I have walked among them with an unscathed heart till within these few weeks; and now, my dear Ellen, be kind enough to look the other way, for though I have not all your sentimental reserve, I have a little maidenly pride of my own, which I would rather not discourage. “You noticed the gentleman who was with me when I first had the happiness to see you — he is an acquaintance of a few weeks standing, and yet, shall I confess all to you? — he has made himself perfectly indispensable to my happiness.” “That may be,” said Ellen. “Yes, my dear, and I suspect there are some who live and act more by rule than I do, who find that such things are. I despise and distrust as much as you can, the idea of love at first sight, and all the folly connected with it, but my late experience has made me a little superstitious in regard to the old orthodox doctrine that `matches are made in heaven.”' “But why so? If the account your cousin has given of Mr. Howard is a just one, (and your cousin seems not to be an enthusiast,) there is nothing supernatural in his winning your affections, and certainly there is nothing extraordinary in his reciprocating them—reciprocal I am sure the attachment must be.” “Certainly, or you would never have heard mine aforesaid confession. Howard and I understand each other, but there are obstacles in my way that he does not understand. “I have always been interested in the character and destiny of my cousin Fenton Campbell, the eldest son of the aunt of whom I spoke to you, who resided in England. From the accounts we have received of him, he inherits his father's genius with the good sense of his mother. He has already attained some distinction in his profession, and has long been the support of his mother and sisters. My aunt Armstead and I have taken especial pains that every account of his thriftiness should be poured into my uncle Richard's ear: and two years ago, when I had mortally offended my uncle, by doing something he had forbidden, or not doing something he had commanded, I forget which, I entreated my aunt to seize the favourable moment to urge Fenton's equal claims to mine, and his superior merits, and to induce my uncle to make a will which should divide his fortune equally between us.” “That was indeed generous, Miss Campbell.” “No, my dear, not particularly generous. I was moved to it more by my impatience under my obligations to my uncle, than by any more disinterested motive.” Ellen's animated countenance evinced that she admired the magnanimity that spurned a self-delusion, and Miss Campbell proceeded— “My uncle was persuaded: he announced his resolution to me, which, as you may imagine, I received with very provoking nonchalance; and he wrote to Fenton, and promised him, that provided he would come immediately to this country, and fix his residence here, he should inherit the half of his estate. Fenton returned a very calm expression of his gratitude, but said it was entirely out of his power to perform the required conditions, as his mother was in a declining state of health, too feeble either to endure a voyage, or to be left by her son. He particularly requested that his mother might not be informed of his uncle's generous intentions in regard to H 3 him, as nothing would distress her so much as to be in any mode an obstacle to the prosperity of her family. This letter of Fenton's of course deepened my favourable impressions of him, but it had quite a contrary effect upon my uncle, who thought that no folly could surpass the giving the go-by to such a chance of fortune. Poor slave of mammon! he could not forgive Fenton for not forsaking all other duties, to bow down and worship the golden image he had set up. Aunt Armstead wrote to him, repeatedly and urgently, to come over for a few months to conciliate my uncle, and confirm his wavering mind, but no motive could persuade him to leave his mother. My uncle suspended his arrangements: his displeasure against Fenton prevented a decision in his favour, while the frequent accounts he received of the young man's diligent application to his profession kept alive his wish to deposit a part of his fortune in his prudent hands. “Thus matters remained till about six months since, when we received the intelligence of my aunt Campbell's death. My uncle Richard renewed his proposition to Fenton; he accepted it, and three months ago arrived in Philadelphia. “I have not yet seen him. My aunt Armstead removed to her country place in Jersey the week before his arrival. Cousin William tells me that the old gentleman has taken surprisingly to Fenton, attracted by the gravity of his manners, which William imputes to his laborious sedentary life, and to his grief for the recent loss of his mother, whom he most tenderly loved. So far all is well—but now, dear Ellen, come the cross purposes. My uncle has taken it into his wise head to institute a partnership concern between Fenton and myself; and on the very day of Fenton's arrival in this country, he announced by letter his supreme will to me, in much the same terms he would employ to convey his orders to a supercargo. Three months ago this would have been well enough; for I have had a sort of indefinite purpose to keep myself fancy free till I could see this cousin of mine— nothing else, I believe, has kept me single so long.” “So long!” exclaimed Ellen, smiling. “Yes, my dear, `so long;' for you must know I am on the verge of three-and-twenty, an age un peu passé in the world of fashion, and quite unknown in the lives of heroines, for excepting lady Geraldine, the most spirited of Miss Edgeworth's characters, and whom (heaven bless her for it!) she has made, I think, to arrive at the mature age of two-and-twenty, I do not remember in all romance, a single heroine that had attained her majority.” “But you surely do not suriously mean, my dear Miss Campbell, that any such motive would influence you in marriage?” “My sweet little methodistic Ellen, I am very much afraid it would; depend upon it, one cannot live altogether in the world and not be of the world: but let me go on with my story, and you will find that I am in danger of a romantic folly that would be more appropriate to your innocence and sweet simplicity. “My cousin, instead of coming immediately to my aunt's, remained in the city. I was a little piqued at his delay, for I thought it would have been much more natural and disinterested for him to look after us than to remain hanging about my uncle. In the meantime, as heaven decreed, William Armstead brought home with him his friend, Howard; he was a Bostonian; that prejudiced me in his favour, for I like the eastern people particularly: they have not, perhaps, the air of fashion, the flexible graces that flourish at the south, but they have great intelligence, high cultivation, and above all, a manly dignity of manners, a simplicity and naturalness, an elevated tone of moral feeling, a”— “Do you speak of a class or an individual?” asked Ellen, archly. “Both, Ellen, both—a noble class, and a most worthy representative of that class. But to proceed. We were in the country. Howard might not have fancied me elsewhere; but there all that is good and ethereal in my nature rises superior to every artificial influence, `the malt's aboon the meal'—moonlight —rural walks, and all the appliances and means of love came in aid of our mutual liking; and, before we parted, we were fast approaching the last interesting scene in the love drama—the exchange of mutual vows. At this critical moment Howard received letters that obliged him to leave us for a few days; he is to be here to-morrow, and it was partly from the wish to have such a friend as you near me at this important juncture, that I so earnestly entreated you to remain at Lebanon. There is a pitfall before me: I am certain that if I fill up the measure of my iniquities by refusing obedience to my uncle in the matter of his nephew, I shall incur his everlasting displeasure and the penalty of disinheritance.” “That,” said Ellen, “can be of little consequence, since you do not incur the penalty by any violation of duty.” “Of little consequence! Would to heaven, Ellen, I were as unsophisticated as you are; or that I had never been `clasped with favour in fortune's tender arms.”' An unwonted seriousness overspread Miss Campbell's face as she added, “I certainly am not selfish. I disdain the vulgar distinction of wealth; but who can escape or evade the force of habit, accustomed as I have been to the ease and indulgence of fortune, to the power it confers, and the deference that attends it. How shall I encounter toil and submit to privations? How shall I bear the neglect of those who have courted my favour, who have felt honoured by my slightest attention?” “By rising to an elevation they never can reach, Miss Campbell,” said Ellen, affectionately taking her hand. “If you love Howard, if he deserves your love, he is worth this sacrifice.” “Upon my word, young ladies, talking of love and lovers before breakfast,” spoke a voice behind them, which made both the ladies start, and turning round they perceived William Armstead approaching them with a letter in his hand. “I have been looking for you, cousin Grace,” he said, “this half hour, and have at length traced you to this place: who would have expected to find you sentimentalising in a shady grove—and before breakfast too? You are leading Grace quite out of her element, Miss Bruce. Grace, I have a letter here for you from our worthy uncle, which, if I mistake not, will contain matter of fact that will dispel all your morning fancies; and I have a piece of news for you too.” “Has Howard arrived?” exclaimed Miss Campbell. “You need not blush, Grace, because your tongue is obedient to your heart. No—Howard has not arrived, but Fenton has.” “Fenton,” replied Miss Campbell in a disappointed tone, and the colour retreated from her cheeks as suddenly as it had appeared. “Oh, William, I could almost wish you the fate of Ascalaphus for bringing me such news.” Miss Campbell broke the seal of her uncle's letter, and ran her eye hastily over it; and as she read half to herself and half aloud, her companions caught these broken sentences—`take it very ill I get no advices from you'—`Fenton more punctual, but says nothing as to the business in hand'—`two for the divisor, don't like that'—`will have neither subtraction nor division to my capital'—`obey orders, marry Fenton, you shall have the sum total'—`disobey and you are a cypher the wrong side of the figure.' Miss Campbell's indignation mantled into her face and sparkled in her eyes, and she tore the letter to fragments and scattered it to the winds. “Mean, sordid being!” she exclaimed; “and he thinks I will traffic with my affections as he does with his merchandise! No, let his silver and gold perish —I will marry whom I please, and when I please!” Ellen with the impulsive sympathy of generous feeling, pressed the arm into which hers was locked; and Armstead said, “spoken worthy of yourself, my dear Grace; but consider well and warily before you take a step which cannot be retracted. You are a woman of sense, and you know it is one thing to wish to attain a difficult summit, and quite another to reach it. You are a woman of prudence—a woman of the world, and you know that the visions of youthful love bear a very faint resemblance to the realities of life. You know, dear Grace, that it would be at least as difficult for a fashionable woman like you to play love in a cottage, as for a camel to go through the eye of a needle —consider well, cousin, consider well before you take an unchangeable resolution.” “I have considered, William—have I not, Ellen?” Ellen smiled without replying, for she feared that her friend's hasty resolution had been somewhat quickened by resentment against her uncle: luckily the warmth of Grace Campbell's feelings at the moment prevented her noticing the half incredulous expression of Ellen's face. “I have considered, William,” she repeated, “and if your friend will take my unportioned hand, Fenton shall be welcome to all my uncle's paltry wealth —he shall see that I despise it, and the world shall know that I disdain its splendour.” “And you, my dear Miss Campbell,” said Ellen, with enthusiasm, “will have the secret consciousness of having acted right and nobly.” “Ah, thank you, Ellen, for your prompting. I am apt I believe to forget secret feelings. I have been a gallery picture, you a sweet little cabinet article; but times are changing with me, and you will teach me better.” “I am thinking, Grace,” said Armstead, “how Howard will relish these changing times, it would be a disappointment to find him not as magnanimous and disinterested as yourself.” “Howard not disinterested! your friendship grows cold, William.” “Not at all—we may as well look truth in the face, cousin, though it should come to us through the medium of a friend or lover—love matches among people who have lived in a certain style, you know, are getting to be quite obsolete—we are beginning to regard them as only becoming boys and girls—only suited to the infancy of society.” “I know not whether you are sarcastic or serious, William.” “Perfectly serious,” rejoined William; “and as serious in my opinion that Fenton Campbell is to the full as disinterested as Howard.” “Impossible! we have all been mistaken in Fenton: he is a cold calculating Englishman—his servility to my uncle proves it. It was unworthy any man of spirit to be the bearer of this letter to me.” “Come, Miss Bruce,” said Armstead to Ellen, “hasten your friend's pace, she will work herself into such a holy indignation against poor Fenton before we reach home, that she will not be able to receive him with common civility. Come, my dear Grace, forget your displeasure—look again like yourself, if it is only to let Fenton see the gem sparkle which he has forfeited.” In vain Armstead continued his efforts as they approached the house to dispel his cousin's gravity: he reasoned, he rallied, but all in vain—the fear he had insinuated into her mind in relation to Howard had taken complete possession of her: she blamed herself for the frankness of her communications; and, for a few moments at least, she would have rejoiced to have been even as destitute as Ellen of extrinsic attractions. Conscious that the agitation of her mind unfitted her for meeting her cousin with the indifference and calm civility which her pride prompted her to assume towards him, she approached the door of the parlour, where Armstead told her that his mother with Fenton was awaiting her, with a slow and most reluctant step. “Come in with me, Ellen,” she said, as her friend was turning away, “I always do better in company than alone;” but as she reached the threshold of the door, she hesitated, and turning to Armstead said, “Do you, William, go in and invent some apology for me, I will meet Fenton at breakfast—it will save us both useless embarrassment.” “Pshaw, Grace! don't behave like a child,” replied her cousin, and at the same instant he settled the mode of proceedure by throwing open the door, and saying with affected formality, “Miss Campbell, allow me to introduce to you my cousin Fenton—my some time friend Howard.” Grace forgot for once whether she was in company or alone—forgot every thing but the surprising certainty that Howard and Fenton were the self-same person —every trace of displeasure vanished from her face, unmixed delight shone in her brightened eye and glowing cheek, and without noticing the joyful expression of her aunt's face, the ludicrous twist of William Armstead's mouth, or the sympathy that moistened Ellen's eye, she gave Fenton her hand, and in virtue of his being friend, lover, or cousin, one or all, permitted him to devour it with kisses. “Come, my dear mother, come, Miss Bruce,” said William Armstead, “I believe we may trust to the good faith of our friends to make their compact without witnesses.” And as he followed the ladies out of the room, he turned, and with a very wise and cautionary shake of the head, said, “beware, cousin Grace, beware of a `cold calculating Englishman!”' “Well, William,” asked Mrs. Armstead, “how have you contrived to keep Fenton's secret so long? you ought to have told me—you surely might have trusted me—you know I am no babbler.” “I know, dear mother, thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know.”' “Oh, for shame Will! I cannot possibly comprehend of what mighty consequence it could be in the first place to devise this secret—and then to keep it.” “Ah, there it is: and this question would have arisen in your mind long ago, and in spite of any resolution to the contrary, some significant look or word would have betrayed our ambush before we had effected our purpose.” “Still, Mr. Armstead,” said Ellen, “I think your mother's question is a VOL. III. I rational one—certainly this artifice does seem a little juvenile and romantic in a man of five-and-twenty; and a man too of Mr. Campbell's gravity of manners.” “If it seems to you romantic, Miss Bruce, it must need explanation; and I am certain that the explanation will satisfy you, that Fenton has been sufficiently rational, and you, my dear mother, that in keeping his counsel, your son has been only prudent.” Armstead then proceeded to say that his cousin had long had the most favourable impression of Grace's character, partly the consequence of the young lady's letters to his mother, which were often accompanied by generous gifts, always offered in the most graceful manner; and partly the consequence of the zealous affection with which his mother had mentioned Grace in her letters to her sister-in-law, and to her nephew; and finally, as he reminded his mother, of her having (notwithstanding her surprising talent at keeping a secret) betrayed Grace's agency in the alteration of her uncle's will.” Here Mrs. Armstead interrupted her son to say `that it was very fortunate she did make that communication; for in a private letter which she received from Fenton at the time, he had declared that, without the knowledge of that circumstance, he never would have accepted his uncle Richard's proposition.' “No doubt, dear mother, you had excellent reasons (as who has not in a like case,) for telling the secret, and abundant consolations for having told it; but allow me to finish my story. Fenton with all these prejudices in Grace's favour, arrives in Philadelphia; is introduced to my uncle, and favourably received. He learns our absence from the city, and determines to follow us immediately; he calls the next morning to take leave of my uncle, and is informed by him with his usual grossierté, of the I 2 contents of the letter he had written to Grace. Fenton knew enough of his consin to believe that she would be as averse from giving her heart, as Falstaff was his reasons, on compulsion; and when I arrived, most opportunely, in Philadelphia on the day he had received this pretty piece of information from my uncle, I found him in a web of such doubts and difficulties, as you sentimentalists, Miss Bruce, are apt to weave about yourselves.” “But we sentamentalists,” rejoined Ellen, “since you insist on placing me in that class, are not apt to expose our difficulties to the profane eyes of scoffers.” “No—and so my cousin would probably have lost himself in a labyrinth, from which no device of human ingenuity could have extricated him, had not some expressions that fell from my uncle revealed to me the secret of his perplexities. I went immediately to Fenton, disclosed to him my discoveries, and suggested the scheme which has succeeded so happily. My uncle Richard knew the young people were together, and believed that all was going on well in obedience to his orders—the complete retirement of my mother's place protected us from observation, and my lofty cousin has been wooed and won in a manner most flattering to her own, and to Fenton's pride.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. “God's holy word, once trivial in his view, Now by the voice of his experience true, Seems, as it is the fountain whence alone Must spring that hope he pants to make his own.” Cowper. Some days glided away while the gay society at Lebanon presented nothing to the eye of a casual observer but a brilliant surface of pleasure. But we claim to be among those gifted personages, who, like the Diable boiteux, are permitted to penetrate below the surface, to visit secret retirements, to dive into the depths of hidden thoughts, to explore their recesses, and to discover them to the curious eye. Availing ourselves of our prerogative, we beg our readers to quit with us the thronged piazzas, the dancing hall, the lively coteries that fill the public rooms, and take a peep into the respective apartments of the individuals we have presumed to introduce to their notice. And first, as entitled to our chief interest, is Ellen—who, in spite of the beseeching looks of Westall and the raillery of Grace Campbell, persisted in secluding herself in her own room. “What romantic whim have you taken into your head, Ellen?” said her friend, who had followed her from the breakfast-table one morning. “Come, my dear, you must not shut yourself up in this cell any longer—I bring an absolute requisition for you from my aunt Armstead, who has ordered the carriage to carry us all to see the shakers, and ramble about the hills in the neighbourhood, to spy out the beauties of the land. Fenton will take his port-folio with him, and while in sketching nature, he is paying his devotions to his first love, I shall be at liberty to give you a lecture upon your duties.” “Well, Miss Campbell, I will go with you.” “Thank you, my dear; but pray do not look as if you were going to the stake.” This was the day on which Ellen expected a reply to her letter to Mrs. Harrison, and she could not conceal, and dared not explain the reluctance with which she consented to an arrangement that must retard the time of her receiving it. She tried to evade Miss Campbell's scrutiny, by saying with a forced smile, “such a frail creature as I am may well feel dread of a lecture on my duties; but you may perhaps lessen it by telling me what those are that are to be the subject of your preaching.” “Kindness to your lover—frankness to your friend, Ellen. There is poor Westall turned off with the `fezzenless bran' of common-place civility, and I, who have poured all my love-lore into your ears, am obliged to make out the history of your heart as well as I can by the index of the changeful cheek—sometimes deadly pale, and then lit up by a glow that seems the shadow of your thoughts, so quickly does it brighten and fade away. You see, my dear, mysterious as you are, I have noted and comprehend the signs of the times.” “Believe me, my dear friend,” said Ellen, taking Grace's hand affectionately, “I have a reason for the suspension of my intercourse with Westall—for my reserve to you, a day or two will, I trust in heaven, end this mystery; and when I am absolved from the necessity of any farther reserve, you shall know all.” “God speed the happy hour, my sweet Ellen, and show me that you have reason, even in your madness.” The ladies were interrupted by Mrs. Westall, who appeared at the door with I 3 her work-box in her hand, `come,' as she said, `to sit the morning with Miss Bruce.' “Miss Bruce is engaged to ride with me, and I hope you will do me the favour to change your purpose, Mrs. Westall,” said Miss Campbell, “and occupy a seat in my aunt's carriage, which we want very much to have agreeably filled.” Mrs. Westall assented readily to the polite request, and while she went for her hat and shawl, Miss Campbell said, “your good mother elect has taken you mightily into favour of late, Ellen. Straws show which way the wind blows. I overheard her yesterday zealously stating your claims to gentility to the Elmores of New-York—a point, you know, of infinite moment in the judgment of the daughters of a ci-devant barmaid.” “And was Mrs. Westall able to establish my right to the favourite epithet `genteel?”' “The pass-word with certain people —yes, my dear, perfectly, I believe; for, after hearing her statement, one of the young ladies observed that her mamma said she `was sure you was genteel from the first moment she saw you, you wore such particularly fine lace, and a real camel's hair; those,' she said, `were mamma's criterions for knowing a lady, they were so lady-like.”' “Oh, what would mamma have said,” exclaimed Ellen, “if she had known that I was indebted to the generosity of Mrs. Harrison for all my lady-like qualities?” “I can't say, my dear, for the inquisition of the young ladies was suddenly interrupted by Mrs. Harris, a relation and dependant of the Osmer family, who rests her fame on her patrician blood, and who, therefore, had another, though perhaps not quite as absurd a criterion by which she would graduate your rank; `pray,' she said, `Mrs. Westall, can you tell me the maiden name of Miss Bruce's mother? I once had a very distant relation who married a Bruce.' Mrs. Westall seemed a little embarrassed—said she did not know; and Mrs. Harris turned to Caroline Redwood who sate next her, and said, `you, Miss Redwood, can probably inform me something of Miss Bruce's parentage.' `I, ma'am!' exclaimed Miss Redwood; `indeed I know nothing of Miss Bruce: I believe her parents are dead:' —and her immoveable colour, Ellen, for once did move, and she was so pale for a moment that I really thought the girl was going to faint. Is it not very strange she should have shown so much emotion on the subject?” “Yes, very strange; but nothing from Miss Redwood can ever surprise me,” said Ellen. Miss Campbell looked on Ellen for a moment earnestly, and then said, with a little hesitation, “the old woman's curiosity is natural enough, and I should like to gratify it. Do tell me, Ellen, your mother's maiden name?” “I cannot tell you, Miss Campbell— do not ask me,” replied Ellen, with a trembling voice. “Forgive me, my sweet friend,” exclaimed Grace Campbell, recovering her usual frank manner, and throwing her arm around Ellen's neck and kissing her pale cheek; “forgive my silly curiosity —every shade of it has passed away. I care not what mine the diamond comes from, so long as I know by every test that it is a diamond of the first water. Come, put on your `real camel's hair,' it is a cool morning, and my aunt is waiting for us.” The ladies joined Mrs. Westall in the passage, and they proceeded together. “Where is your son this morning, Mrs. Westall?” asked Grace Campbell; “he hardly deserves an inquiry, recreant knight that he is.” “Oh, say not so, Miss Campbell; he is detained from us by a painful duty; he has scarcely left Mr. Redwood's bedside for the last two days—poor man: Charles thinks him declining rapidly.” “There is no doubt,” replied Miss Campbell, “that he is sinking very fast. I saw him yesterday sitting by his window; I observed he had the ghastly paleness of death, and though he bowed to me with his usual courtesy, not a muscle of his face moved.” “I hope,” said Ellen—“I believe he is not as sick as you imagine; he suffers from extreme depression of spirits.” “Yes,” said Miss Campbell; “but this very depression aggravates his disease. He is, as far as I can learn, in the very depths of nervous misery. I heard his insensible daughter say to Fitzgerald yesterday, that she expected her father would come out a methodist at last, for she never went into his room that she did not find him with a Bible in his hands.” “A Bible!” exclaimed Ellen—“God be praised!” Miss Campell caught the fine expression of Ellen's upraised eye—“What a little enthusiast you are, Ellen. You would make an admirable lay-preacher; but in the present rage for division of labour, it is not proper to preach and practise too; so you shall practise and I will preach: shall we unite our talents for the consolation of Mr. Redwood?” “I should rejoice in any vocation that could administer consolation to him,” replied Ellen. “No doubt, my dear,” said her lively friend; “but pray keep your holy zeal to yourself, for here comes Fenton, a sworn disciple of Gall and Spurzheim, and we shall have him exploring your head for the `organ of veneration,' and your heart for its correspondent qualities; and then I am afraid I shall find to my cost that he is without the `organ of adhesiveness'—that, I suppose, may stand for constancy in your bump metaphysics, Fenton?” “Yes, my dear Grace; and if I do not possess it, and finely developed too, I will sacrifice my theory to experience, like a true philosopher.” Miss Campbell was about to reply when her aunt said, “you forget we are waiting for you, Grace. Fenton, hand Mrs. Westall to the carriage. Give heaven all due thanks, Mrs. Westall, that you have not a pair of lovers on your hands.” “I should be in a much more grateful humour if I had,” replied Mrs. Westall, looking kindly on Ellen. Ellen would have comprehended Mrs. Westall's meaning without the interpreting glance that beamed on her from Miss Campbell's eye, and she sprang into the carriage after her friend, her heart quite lightened of one burden that had pressed sorely on it. In the meantime Westall, abstracting his mind as far as possible from his own deeply interesting concerns, was performing his benevolent duty at the bedside of Mr. Redwood, whose decline was indeed more rapid than even his friend, who knew the feverish state of his mind, could have anticipated. At times, fixed in the gloom of deep despondency, his mind seemed cut off from all communion with the external world: his appearance was that of a man suffering from the frightful images of a dream—his fixed and glassy eye— the drops of sweat that stood thick on his livid brow—his fixed posture—his clenched hands—his whole attitude and expression betrayed utter despair. At these moments all Westall's efforts to arouse him seemed not to make the slightest impression on his senses—but, suddenly, he would turn his eager eye on his young friend, and listen to him as if the sentence of life or death was on his lips, while Westall set forth the arguments for the truth of our religion with which his familiarity with its evidences furnished him, and suggested its hopes and consolations. There were intervals too, when Redwood felt as if he had attained a living fountain—as if his spirit was for ever emancipated from the bondage of doubt and despondency, and peace was commanded on his troubled mind: but these intervals were short. “Ah Westall,” he would exclaim, “I am afraid to trust myself. I know not how far my mind is enfeebled by disease. I know not how far my faith and hope may have their source in the strong necessity I feel for present relief. The objects of sense are becoming dim to my sight—the cold shadows of death are settling about me: my dear Charles, in this frightful state, can I calmly investigate the evidence of the truth of a religion which promises pardon to the penitent for the past—resurrection and immortal life for the future?” “But, my dear Sir,” replied Westall, “there have been men, in intellectual power the first of their species, who in the full vigour of their faculties, with the aids of learning and leisure, have calmly pursued their honest inquiries, and have received our blessed religion as the rule of life—the victory over death.” “True — true, Westall; but names have now no authority with me. I have been too long their dupe and victim. Oh, how in my folly I have admired, and praised, and almost worshipped those leaders of our sect, who lived fearlessly, and braved undaunted the terrors of death! Now I see nothing in what seemed to me their philosophic fortitude, but an obstinate vanity, a pride of opinion, a self-deifying, that made them render homage to their own consequence, when they should have sought the God of their spirits. “Westall, I shudder at the thought of such a death as Gibbon's, Hume's, Voltaire's—if their indifference to the future was unaffected, what a voluntary degradation to the level of the brute creation! if pretended, what mad audacity!” “But surely,” said Westall, “there is honest scepticism in the world. There are minds so constituted, or exposed to such unhappy influences, that unbelief becomes a condition almost irresistible.” “Yes—it may be so,” replied Mr. Redwood; “it must be so—but for my own case, I have no such flattering unction. Humbling as the confession is, Charles,” he added, (taking up the Bible which now was almost always in his hands,) “till within this last month, I have never read this book with seriousness—never but from idle curiosity, or to find exercise for my ingenuity, or food for my ridicule: and now I would give worlds for one year, nay, one month of the life that in my folly and madness I have cursed as a weary burden imposed by arbitrary power, that my mind might be opened to the light which has dawned on it from that book—my heart reformed by its rules—renewed by its influence.” “God grant you, my dear Sir,” said Westall, fervently grasping Mr. Redwood's hand, “not one but many years to be blessed with its efficacy. But for the present let me entreat you to dismiss all agitating thoughts, and to make an effort only for that resignation which is the first principle of our religion, and which will certainly produce inviolable repose.” The conversation of the gentlemen was interrupted by the entrance of Miss Redwood, who came to make her usual morning visit. She lingered longer than usual, and inquired with more particularity into her father's symptoms. She entreated him to send to town for a physician—examined the vials on his table, and expressed her fears that every thing was not going on right. Her father observed a good deal of agitation in her manner—he thought it indicated unusual solicitude, and he was touched by it. “My dear Caroline,” he said, “all might perhaps go right, if you would come and help my kind friend Charles to nurse me.” “Lord, papa, I would with all my heart: I should like to do any thing— every thing for you; but you know I am no nurse, and sickness is so frightful.” “Frightful, indeed, Caroline; but a child's tenderness might, I think, deprive if of half its terrors.” “Well, dear sir,” whispered Caroline, slipping a letter into her father's hand, “grant the petition this letter contains, and I will stay day and night with you for a fortnight to come.” Mr. Redwood took the letter and detained Caroline's hand, though she was evidently impatient to withdraw. Westall rose to leave the room. “Stay, I intreat you, Westall, and you, Caroline—one moment's patience, my child—I anticipate the contents of this letter. Charles must be the bearer of my answer to it: you should have no reserves from him Caroline, for, after I am gone, he must be your protector till your marriage transfers that duty to another.” “I hope, Sir,” replied Miss Redwood, with a look of anxiety and displeasure, “that I shall be permitted to choose my own protector.” Westall walked to the extreme part of the room to relieve Caroline as far as possible from the embarrassment of his presence, while her father read the letter, which contained, as he expected, a declaration of Captain Fitzgerald's love for his daughter, and respect for himself, written in good setterms, and according to the most approved formularies, and concluding with the modest request, authorized by Miss Redwood, that Mr. Redwood would consent to their immediate union. “Is it possible, Caroline,” said Mr. Redwood, laying his finger on the last request in the letter, “that you authorized or approved this?” “Yes, Sir.” “And you would desert your sick— your dying father, to go off with this fellow—a stranger—a fortune-hunter, a profligate!” “Caroline's colour deepened at every additional epithet her father bestowed on her lover; she flashed an indignant glance on Westall, as if she would have said, `an enemy hath done this;' and commanding her voice as well as she was able, she replied, “you are very unjust, papa; your mind has been set against us; and you forget that if Captain Fitzgerald or I had deserved your cruel suspicions, we should have taken a very different course; if your fears are well-founded, a short time would leave me at liberty to bestow my hand and fortune when and where I please; but I neither expected nor wished that liberty. Fitzgerald, whatever you may think, is a man of honour; and I am sure he is sincere, when he says in his letter that next to my affections, he desires your favour.” “No doubt, no doubt—my favour and its consequences; but he shall have neither—Westall, tell him so,” added Mr. Redwood, raising his voice above his daughter's, who was giving vent to her feelings in hysterical sobs: “tell Fitzgerald I will never consent to his marriage with my daughter; tell him that I am a dying man, but let him found no hopes thereon, for I am resolved, that if my daughter ever marries him, she shall forfeit her fortune.” “And who,” said Caroline, recovering perfectly her self-possession, “who VOL. III. K shall receive it? the smooth pious Ellen Bruce—or the kind friend Charles Westall —or perhaps some missionary or tract society?” “Oh Caroline, Caroline!” exclaimed her father, in sorrow more than in anger, “God forgive you.” After a moment's pause, he added, in a voice faultering from extreme weakness, but thrilling from the earnestness which deep feeling gave to its tones, “oh, my child, give me your confidence for the few days of life that remain to me—think no more of this man—he is not worthy of you— he is not worthy the trust of any delicate woman: give to my last hours, Caroline, the consolation of a voluntary surrender of your feelings and judgment to mine.” Caroline made no reply. “Speak for me, Westall,” continued Mr. Redwood, raising himself, and leaning his head against the post of his bedstead, “speak for me, I have neither voice nor strength.” “It is unnecessary, Sir,” said Westall, and he turned an appealing look on Caroline, as he added, “Miss Redwood will not, I am certain, resist what you have already said.” “And who, or what, Sir,” asked Caroline, her spirit rising from the control of her better feelings, “has given you a right to interfere in my private concerns?” “Your father.” “My father, Sir, cannot delegate his rights nor my obedience.” “But your father, Caroline,” interposed Mr. Redwood, “can make your obedience a necessity—go, Westall, and make my decision known to Fitzgerald.” “Permit me, Sir, at least,” said Caroline, “to be the bearer of your message. It should, I think, be tempered by some friendliness in the messenger.” “Go then, child—and if you have no regard for me, respect yourself; open your eyes to the real views of this man, K 2 and dismiss him for ever from your thoughts.” Caroline deigned no reply, but left the room, her face indicating the determination of an imperious spirit. “Oh Westall, Westall!” exclaimed Redwood, “from what misery I might have saved myself and my child by the timely performance of my duties to her.” He seemed for a few moments lost in sorrowful reflections, and then starting up, he asked Westall if there were yet no letters from Mrs. Harrison. Westall, whose ear had been quickened by his impatience, said he trusted there was a letter at the office, for he had just heard the horn of the post-coach as it descended the eastern mountain. “Go then, dear Charles, and get the letter—the warrant for your happiness; and God grant that I may see the best blessings of his providence resting on you before I die.” After a long interview with her lover, which was spent chiefly in listening to passionate declarations of disinterested affection, which she more than half believed, Miss Redwood retired to her room in great agitation of spirits and summoned her servant. When Lilly appeared, she received a communication which rendered it necessary that she should make new arrangements of her mistress's baggage—trunks and bandboxes were emptied on to the bed, chairs, and floor, and from the chaos of fine clothes, the mistress and maid proceeded to make such selections as their taste and discretion dictated. Neither the principal nor agent seemed to possess the calmness necessary to the execution of these sudden preparations. Indeed it was difficult to say which was most flurried with her own individual purposes and expectations. Lilly on sundry pretexts went often out of the room, and always returned in a humour to deserve the pettish rebuke which she received from Caroline. But the rebuke was no sooner given than retracted; for Caroline, afraid of the consequences of provoking the girl, conciliated her by some petty gift—some olive-branch symbol, which mistresses and maids both comprehend. Those only who understand the momentous and intricate details of a fine lady's wardrobe, will believe that the remainder of the day was consumed in packing a trunk of ordinary dimensions. Caroline then proceeded herself to arrange her dressing-case: after having stowed away compactly its usual apparatus, she inclosed the treasure rifled from Ellen in a sheet of paper, carefully sealed it, and then placed it in the dressing-case. She laid in her purse also, locked it, and gave the key to Lilly. “Now Lilly,” she said, “I believe every thing is ready. I trust in heaven we shall return to-morrow; but if we do not, we have secured every thing of value.” Miss Redwood looked at her watch; “it is time to go,” she said, hurrying on her hat and shawl: “do you, Lilly, drag the trunk to the farther stair-case, you'll find a man there ready to receive it—then return and take the dressing-case in your own hands—remember, girl, my purse is in it, and I had rather you should lose your own soul than that any thing should happen to it—but stop, let me see, cannot I take it myself; just tuck it under my shawl—no one will observe it.” Lilly gave the dressing-case to her mistress: “but Lord bless me, Miss Caroline,” she said, “it makes you such a figure—just look in the glass.” Caroline looked, but for once her appearance seemed to be a secondary object. “I will take it myself, Lilly,” she said, “it's nonsense to stand here deliberating about it. I shall only carry it to the door, and then give it to Captain Fitzgerald.” Caroline opened the door—Lilly laid her hand on it, “Now, Miss Cary,” she said beseechingly, “do give it to me for once. It will look so unbecoming for the captain to be seen carrying your dressing-case—Lord help us, such a footman's job!” “Hush, girl, I must go.”—“You may go, Miss Cary, but for goodness' sake give me the dressing-case—why I shall whip down the hill, across the fields, and be at the carriage before you.” “Take it then, you fool,” said Caroline: and she resigned the dressing-case, and turned hastily away. She stole along the passage with the silent tread of a culprit: when she came to her father's door a pang of remorse, probably aided by an emotion of filial feeling, checked her footsteps, `he looked so terribly sick this morning,' she said mentally— `Good heaven! should I never see him again.' She lifted her hand to knock for admittance, when she was arrested by a voice that alarm just raised above a whisper—“Miss Redwood! my dear Miss Redwood! what are you doing?— For heaven's sake no more delay.” The thought of her father vanished from her mind—she bounded forward—gave her arm to Fitzgerald, and they passed together unobserved out of the house. The last ray of summer's long twilight was not quite lost in the shadows of the evening, and the fugitives prudently selected the most unfrequented road, by which to descend to the plain below, where a carriage was in waiting for them. The poets say, `the course of true love never doth run smooth,' and so thought Miss Redwood, when half way down the hill she and her companion were encountered by Ellen and Westall. — Westall had, early in the day, obtained possession of the looked-for letter from Lansdown, K 3 and having awaited Ellen's return, till patience had had her perfect work, and would work no longer, he had sallied forth in the expectation of meeting the returning party, as he did at no great distance. They had been delayed by an accident that had lamed one of their horses, a circumstance that afforded a pretext to Westall to propose to the young ladies to quit the carriage and walk up the hill; and he, leaving Miss Campbell with her natural escort Fenton, proceeded with Ellen, and for a very good reason had preferred, as lovers are apt to do, without any reason at all, the most retired road. As soon as they were removed from observation, he produced Mrs. Harrison's letter, and Ellen was attempting to read it by the feeble light, when they were met by Miss Redwood and Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald internally cursed the unlucky encounter, and Caroline drew her bonnet closer; but any apprehensions they might feel seemed quite unnecessary, for Ellen did not raise her eyes from the letter, and Westall only noticed them by slightly touching his hat, being at the moment too much engrossed with his own affairs to have any suspicions excited in relation to theirs. They therefore proceeded unmolested to the place where the carriage was stationed, a servant let down the steps, and Fitzgerald was hurrying Caroline into it, when she started back, exclaiming, “Good heavens! Lilly is not here—I cannot go till she comes.” The servant who had brought the trunk, on being inquired of, said that the girl had left him with the declaration that she would follow immediately. “Then,” said Caroline, “there is no alternative—we must wait—I cannot and will not go without her.” It certainly was not Fitzgerald's cue as yet to cross the will or whims of Miss Redwood, and he submitted with the best grace he could assume. A servant was sent back to the Springs to hasten the faithless girl, and returned after an interval that had seemed to the anxious and impatient lovers interminable, with the perplexing information that Lilly was no where to be found. Caroline was in despair, and Captain Fitzgerald, impatient at her manifesting a degree of feeling which he deemed out of all proportion to the importance of the occasion, could scarcely curb his displeasure while he urged the necessity of their proceeding immediately. “We are mad to delay thus, my dear Miss Redwood,” said he; “you are, no doubt, missed before this time: that meddling fellow, Westall, will be sure to tell your father that he saw us: our plans will be counteracted—my happiness sacrificed. The girl is doubtless detained by some trifling accident; or if by her own fault, her insolence shall be chastised to-morrow—for to-morrow, my dear Miss Redwood, we shall beyond all question, return.” “Think you so—are you sure of it, Captain Fitzgerald?” “Absolutely sure—it cannot be otherwise.” “Then order the coachman to drive on,” said Caroline, sinking back into the carriage in a state of mind ill suited to the errand on which she was going. In vain Fitzgerald essayed to soothe, to argue, to flatter her into her usual spirits. Her imagination pictured a dying unforgiving father: the beseeching pathetic tones of his voice, to which in the morning she had refused to listen, rang in her ears like a funeral knell: she was now tortured with the fear that Lilly had been treacherous, and now with the possibility that the secrets of the dressing-case might be accidentally revealed; and when she arrived at the place of their destination, a village inn a few miles from Lebanon, her feelings were wrought up to a pitch of excitement little short of frenzy. Fitzgerald ascertained that the pastor of the village was absent, but that fortunately there had just arrived at the inn an itinerant clergyman, who, to use his own homely phrase, was `candidating about the country,' and though a very inferior member of a most respectable body, he was regularly licensed, and was therefore legally qualified to perform the marriage ceremony. Some time elapsed before Miss Redwood became so much tranquillized that Fitzgerald deemed it prudent to expose her to the observation of a third person. She at last yielded, partly to the influence of her lover, and partly to the propriety—the now inevitable necessity — of controlling her feelings. The clergyman was summoned—he took his station—appointed to the parties theirs, and then drawing a hymn-book from his pocket, he said, `it would be pleasing if the gentleman and lady would commence the present solemn exercise by singing a hymn.' “Singing a hymn!” exclaimed Fitzgerald: “Is that a necessary part of the marriage service in this country, Sir?” “Oh no, Sir, not necessary, but very suitable. I don't know what the custom may be here in York state, but in Connecticut it is quite customary to close a marriage opportunity with a singing exercise. I thought upon the present interesting occasion it would be best to begin with the singing, as the young lady looks a little flurried, and might not be able to unite with us after the solemnity is concluded.” “We will dispense with the hymn, Sir,” said Fitzgerald, smothering an imprecation on the whole body of puritanical parsons. “Please to proceed to do your office, and with all possible brevity.” The clergyman, however, had quite too much respect for professional details to comply with the last injunction. He began with a dissertation on the happiness of the married state; he then proceeded to an exhortation to the faithful performance of its duties, and closed his prefatory `exercise' with a prayer, which it is to be feared failed to produce one sentiment of devotion in the parties. The prayer finished, he began the service that was to bind Caroline indissolubly to Fitzgerald, when the whole party was startled by loud and reiterated knocking at the outer door. Fitzgerald's conscience foreboded evil: he quitted Caroline's side, and sprang towards the door to turn the key; but no key, no bolt, no means of fastening were to be found. He returned to Caroline; she was trembling excessively; he took her hand, and whispered, “for heaven's sake be composed—what should we fear from an interruption?” and then addressing the clergyman, he said, somewhat sternly, “proceed, Sir, to your duty.” But the good meek man was not at all qualified for so energetic a measure, and while he hesitated, the noise in the passage increased. The intruder had made good his entrance, and was in an altercation with the landlord. The declaration “I must see them, Sir, and that instantly,” reached the ears of the lovers, and was directly followed by the throwing open of the door, and the appearance of Charles Westall. “Why this impertinent intrusion, Sir?” said Fitzgerald, advancing to Westall with an air of defiance. “This is no time, Captain Fitzgerald,” replied Westall, quite unmoved, “for us to bandy insults; our quarrel, if we have any, must be deferred; my business is with Miss Redwood, and admits of no delay. Miss Redwood,” he added, turning to Caroline, and taking her hand, “I beseech you to return with me to your father. I have left him in a state that precludes all hope of his life; that precludes, I fear, the hope that he will even recover his consciousness.” “Then of what use, Sir, can Miss Redwood's return be?” interposed Fitzgerald. “Of what use!—I appeal to you Miss Redwood: your father may be conscious of your presence; an act of duty and affection may soften the anguish of the dying hour; and it may, Miss Redwood, be a source of consolation for yourself, which, believe me, you will need.” “I will go with you, Mr. Westall,” replied Caroline, in a faultering voice, and she threw on her hat and shawl, which were lying beside her, and offered her arm to Westall. Fitzgerald thrust himself between Westall and Caroline, and seizing her arm turned fiercely to Westall, “Stand off, Sir!” said he; “I have a right to Miss Redwood. Miss Redwood, you have plighted your faith to me; you cannot—shall not leave me till the priest has done his office.” “Captain Fitzgerald,” said Westall, “you need not apprehend any interference with your rights: matters have gone too far between you and Miss Redwood to be retraced: all that I ask—all that I wish is, that you will not attempt to deter her from doing an imperious duty, which omitting to do will disgrace her eternally.” Fitzgerald was softened by the admission of what he feared would be a contested right, he relinquished Caroline's arm, and permitted Westall, without any farther opposition, to lead her to his carriage. Westall then returned for a moment to Fitzgerald, to beseech him to take all feasible measures to prevent the publicity of the evening's expedition; if not prevented, he thought it might be deferred till Miss Redwood had left the Springs, and she thus saved from the disgrace to which a lady is always exposed by a clandestine affair. He then left Fitzgerald to take such means as his own prudence should suggest to effect this desirable purpose, and proceeded with Caroline, as expeditiously as possible, to the Springs, where they arrived between twelve and one o'clock. Caroline fortunately did not encounter any person on her way to her own room, whither she went to await the summons which Westall promised to send her as soon as he could ascertain her father's present condition. It may be necessary to account for what appears to have been very impolitic haste on the part of Caroline and her lover. The threatening symptoms of Mr. Redwood's increasing illness, certainly warranted the natural hope of Fitzgerald, that Miss Redwood's parent did not possess the gift of immortality, which impatient fortune-hunters are apt to attribute to rich old fathers — and the constant and even growing favour of the beautiful daughter, authorized the confident expectation which the gallant Captain indulged, of a successful termination of his campaign; when, lo! one of those adverse accidents, that happen alike in love and war, occurred to frustrate his plan of operations: this was none other than the receipt of a letter from his commanding officer, containing an order to rejoin his regiment; and the information that the regiment was ordered to a station in the West Indies. The Captain perceived, at once, that in this exigency a coup de main was the only mode of extrication from his embarrassments. He immediately informed Miss Redwood of his recall; but as he knew that the young lady had set her heart on a voyage to Europe, he prudently deferred to a subsequent opportunity the communication of the appointment of his regiment to the West India station. It had become necessary to make a premature application to Mr. Redwood: Caroline, as has been seen, unable to resist the pleadings of her lover, consented to be the medium of it. Mr. Redwood's decided answer precluded the hope that he would change his mind. It was impossible for the Captain to await the lingering termination of his sickness, and the hacknied procedure of a clandestine marriage was the last and only resort. Few fathers are inexorable, and nothing, as Fitzgerald thought, was more improbable than that Mr. Redwood, with a spirit subdued by a mortal sickness, would withhold his forgiveness from his only child; and, in the very worst supposeable case, (for which Caroline had provided by the arrangement of her baggage) the affairs of the heiress might be committed to an agent. Thus had the Captain, after a survey of the whole ground, with the prudence of a skilful officer, provided for every contingency but precisely that one which for the present suspended his victory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. “Breaks not the morning's cheering light Forth from the darkest hour of night!” Young Lady's Scrapbook. We must now return to relate the incidents that had occurred while Caroline and her lover were pursuing their clandestine expedition. Ellen and Westall were left slowly retracing their way to the Springs, and poring over Mrs. Harrison's letter. Whatever might have been the excellent old lady's epistolary talents, Westall certainly thought her letter a chef d'œuvre when he read the following passage:— “I have no hesitation, my beloved Ellen, in giving you a decision on the subject you have referred to me. You have borne your probation with unremitting patience, and I am sure your fortitude will be equal to the issue, whatever it may be. I see no reason for delaying one moment to penetrate the mystery of your birth. I have, as you well know, admired and encouraged your fidelity to the letter of your mother's dying injunctions; and I do not see that you depart from its spirit now. The box was not to be opened till you had arrived at the age of twenty-one, except in case you should previously make a matrimonial engagement. The engagement made, you were at liberty to explore the box: but your own delicate scruples (which I perfectly approve) induce you to defer your engagement, till you ascertain what bearing this long dreaded, long desired secret may have on your history. Though I am convinced that whatever discovery you may make will not affect the wishes or decision of your lover, yet you are right VOL. III. L to leave him the liberty which you reserve to yourself. “I do not ask for riches or honours for you, my dear Ellen, but my earnest desire is, that you may have sprung from virtuous parents, whose memory you may cherish with an honest pride, and to a reunion with whom you may look forward with eager and well-founded hope: whatever may be the event, do not delay to inform me of it; remember that I must weep or rejoice with you; that the light which shines on you, will send its cheering ray to my old heart; or if there must be clouds in your heaven, that they will overshadow me too—for we have the same horizon.” Mrs. Harrison's advice was most acceptable and most gratefully received, as advice always is, when it happens to coincide with the strongest inclinations of the heart. When the lovers reached the house, they heard the bell ringing which announced the tea hour, and perceived that the company was thronging to the tea-room. As they ascended the steps of the piazza, Westall said, “let us improve the present opportunity, Ellen—the east parlour is vacant, and for a short time at least we shall be in no danger of interruption there. I will order candles while you go for your treasure.” Ellen assented—left him, and re-appeared in a few moments with the box in her hand: her cheeks were alternately deeply flushed and deadly pale. Westall understood too well the source whence her feelings flowed to attempt to check them. Ellen tried to unlock the box, but she could not—she shivered with emotion. “Do you open it,” she said, giving it to Westall, “for I cannot.” Westall as he took the box from her, perceived that her hands were as cold as marble. “Had you not better defer this, Ellen?” he asked. L 2 “No, no, I am prepared for any thing now,” she replied, sinking on her knees before the table on which Westall had placed the box. Westall turned the key, and disclosed to her eager eye the interior, containing nothing but a small miniature case. The bright glow of expectation faded from Ellen's cheek, “Oh my mother! my mother!” she exclaimed, in a voice in which bitter disappointment and tender expostulation mingled. Westall took her clasped hands between his—both were silent for a few moments: he then said, “My dear Ellen, do not distress yourself thus— have not your fears vanished with your hopes? this unforeseen result pains you, but is it not better, far better, than much that you have apprehended? and severe as your disappointment is, Ellen, will you not be consoled by the devotion of my life to you?” Ellen only replied by laying her head on her hands and weeping bitterly. Westall proceeded to urge every consolation which the stimulated tenderness of a lover could suggest, but Ellen was deaf to all that he said. It seemed as if she had been that moment torn from the bosom of her mother, and was left alone in the universe. “Oh, it was then an artifice,” she said: “Caroline Redwood spoke the cruel truth. I could have borne any thing but this,” she continued, with an impetuosity that startled Westall—“for this I was not prepared.” “My mother! must I never vindicate —must I never speak your name!” Again and again she took up the box, examined it without and within, and dropping it, exclaimed, “oh my mother, is this all?” There was something so sacred in Ellen's grief—something so touching in her brief expressions, and in the indescribable language of her beautiful countenance, that even her lover, whose heart vibrated to every pulsation of hers, was compelled to silence. Mechanically he took up the miniature case, and passing his eye over it, he perceived a fragment of paper adhering to the edge of it, on which was written in a delicate female hand, “From my”— the remainder of the sentence had been torn off. It occurred to Westall at once that there might have been some foul play, and he was on the point of suggesting his conjecture to Ellen, when they were both startled by some one tapping at the door, and then impatiently opening it. “Pardon my intrusion,” said Miss Campbell, instinctively shrinking back and then advancing, “my errand admits of no ceremony—Mr. Westall, you must go immediately to Mr. Redwood, his servant has been anxiously looking for you —he says his master is extremely ill, and sends to entreat you not to delay a moment to come to him.” “I cannot go now,” said Westall, insensible for the moment to any suffering but Ellen's. “You must go,” said Miss Campbell, with an imperative decision, which indicated that she had more reason for her urgency than her words expressed, and Westall whispering an entreaty to Ellen that he might be permitted to see her again in the course of the evening, left the ladies to witness a scene of more remediless grief than Ellen's. Miss Campbell remained for a few moments an embarrassed spectator of Ellen's emotion: it surprised and affected her the more, because there was in Ellen's ordinary manner such an instinctive shrinking from the display, or the exposure of her feelings. Grace was not however of a temper to remain for any length of time a silent or inactive observer of a friend's sufferings, and after a few moments she kindly passed her arm round Ellen and said, “what rude storm has assailed you, my dear Ellen?” Ellen made no effort to reply, and after a little pause her friend added, “though you will not let me feel with you, you must permit me to think for you, Ellen—you are exposed to intrusion here. Let me go with you to your room—I will stipulate to make no demands—no inquiries—only suffer me to remain with you till you are more composed.” Ellen returned the pressure of her friend's hand in token of her acquiescence, and taking up once more her box with a heart-bursting sigh, she retreated to her own apartment with Miss Campbell; and there, after having recovered from the first shock of her disappointment, she rewarded the delicate kindness and affectionate interest of her friend by confiding to her the few particulars of her long-cherished hopes, and the final utter demolition of them. And now we must leave her, listening to such consolation as the inventive mind of her friend could suggest, while we follow Charles Westall to the apartment of Mr. Redwood, whom he found walking to and fro in the greatest agitation, supported by his servant. At the sight of Westall he sunk into a chair, exclaiming, “it is all over, Charles —she has gone—she has left me to die here—gone without one parting word— misguided miserable girl!” The recollection of his meeting with Miss Redwood darted across Westall's mind, and he comprehended at once Mr. Redwood's emotion and the language he held. “Impossible, Sir!” he said, “she cannot have gone without leaving some explanation—some communication for you —go Ralph, and find Miss Redwood's servant, and bid her come here.” L 3 “Find Lilly!” replied the man, “I might as well look for the wind that blew yesterday, Mr. Westall; Lilly has gone faster one way than Miss Caroline has the other.” “Lilly gone—and not with her mistress? Do you then, Ralph, go yourself to Miss Redwood's room, and look on her dressing-table; she may possibly have left a letter there for her father.” “And of what avail, Charles, if she has?” asked Mr. Redwood—“what explanation can soften the terrible truth? but go, Ralph, go. The man obeyed, but not till he had whispered to Westall, “keep a steady eye on master: the fever betimes mounts to his head, and then he is raving.” The man's apprehensions seemed quite superfluous, for excepting a few rational exclamations, such as “poor— poor girl!” “Oh God, thou art most just!” “Charles, this last blow is too much for me!” Mr. Redwood remained silent till the servant returned holding in his hand a large pacquet, which he said `might be for master, though there was no writing on the top of it.' Mr. Redwood snatched it from him and broke the seal. As he unfolded the pacquet, a miniature rolled from it on to the floor, and Westall picked it up. The image of the only relict in Ellen's box was still vivid in Westall's mind, and it was not strange that he should have instinctively compared the dimensions of the miniature with the case in Ellen's possession, and hardly conscious of the several links in the chain of his thoughts, he turned the miniature to examine the back of it. The upper part of the paper that had been pasted over it, was torn off, and on that remaining was traced in the same hand-writing that was on Ellen's fragment, “beloved husband to his faithful Mary.” A faint light dawned on Westall's mind, when his attention was withdrawn by a sudden exclamation from Mr. Redwood. “In the name of heaven,” he said, “what does this mean? how did Caroline get possession of these papers?” and he held up the certificate of his marriage with Mary Erwine, and the letter directed “to my child.” “Oh, Charles,” he added, “my head—my head;” and he pressed both hands to his head as if his thoughts were bursting it. “Oh memory—memory!—think for me—tell me what these mean!” “Be composed Sir,—I beseech you,” said Westall, in the calmest tone he could assume: then opening the letter he glanced his eye rapidly over it, refolded it and paused; he could not speak: his first impulse was to fly to Ellen and tell her that Mr. Redwood was her father. The fearful wildness of Mr. Redwood's eye still fixed inquiringly on him, recalled him to the present necessity. The discovery must be first made to him; and Westall lost every other consideration in his anxiety to make the communication in such a way as not to destroy the equipoise of Mr. Redwood's mind, which seemed now utterly unable to sustain any additional excitement. He still hesitated—it appeared that Mr. Redwood understood his apprehensions, for grasping his hand, he said, “Speak quickly, Charles, while I can comprehend you.” “Be patient, Sir—be calm, I entreat you,” replied Westall; “there is a blessing—an unspeakable blessing in reserve for you—this letter is from Mary Erwine—from your wife to her child.” “To her child, Charles!—you perplex me—you disturb me; she had no child.” “Yes, Mr. Redwood,” replied Westall, almost choking with his own emotions, “her child, and God be praised, that child lives—lives to love and to bless you.” “What is it you mean, Westall? explain yourself,” said Mr. Redwood, covering his face with his hands. Westall described as concisely as possible the condition in which he had found the box left by Ellen's mother; and he read aloud some passages of the letter which placed, beyond the possibility of doubt, the fact that Mr. Redwood's wife left a child, and that that child was Ellen Bruce. Westall did not deem it necessary to allude to the mode by which these testimonials must have passed into Caroline's possession. Mr. Redwood listened in breathless silence, till Westall had concluded. Not an exclamation, not a sound escaped from him, save the audible beating of his heart. After a few moments he uncovered his face, a smile passed over it as wild and transient as the flashings of lightning on the dark cloud. “Send for Ellen,” he said, the effort to speak slowly and calmly too apparent in his voice: “do you stay with me, Charles—I must not be left alone: the light burns dimly here,” he added, pressing his hand to his head. “Do not send for her now,” said Westall, “give this night to tranquillity —to happy anticipations. To-morrow you will be better prepared to see her.” “To-morrow! now or never, Charles; send without one moment's delay.” Westall took out his pencil to write a note to Ellen. Mr. Redwood stopped him, “No, my dear Charles,” he said, “go yourself—the poor child will need some preparation—she will need your support. I shall do well enough—I am better—much better now.” Westall went and returned with Ellen, in a space of time that seemed brief, even to Mr. Redwood. Ellen was as pale as marble; but a celestial joy shone in her face—she sprang towards her father: he rose, stretched out his arms to receive her, and folding her in them, they wept together. After a moment he started back, and gazed wildly on Ellen. “Ellen Bruce, my child?” he said—“is it not all a dream? Speak to me Ellen—call me father—forgive me in your mother's name.” Ellen's resolution forsook her: alarmed, trembling, and weeping, she sunk on her knees; her father shook his head, and would have stooped to raise her, but utterly exhausted by the conflict of his feelings, he leaned on Westall's shoulder. A single look from Westall roused all Ellen's energies; she sprang to her father's aid, and assisted Westall to lay him on the bed. “He is insensible for the moment,” whispered Westall, “but he will soon recover his consciousness, and then, my dear Ellen, his life—more than life, his reason will depend on your fortitude and calmness.” Westall then gave into Ellen's hands the miniature, the certificate, and the letter—the last she kissed again and again —poured over it a shower of tears, and not daring then to trust herself to look in it, she placed it in her bosom. She then took her station beside her father, and watched with inexpressible anxiety every variation of his changeful countenance. He soon recovered sufficiently to speak, but his first words confirmed their worst fears; for they were the ravings of delirium. He laughed and wept alternately—he called on Ellen —on her mother—on Westall; but most frequently and with most impetuosity, he demanded Caroline. He seemed to imagine that she was on the brink of a precipice, and to feel that he vainly sought to rescue her. So much did his madness appear to be stimulated by this fancy, that after a short consultation Westall and Ellen determined that an effort should be made to induce Miss Redwood to return immediately, to try what effect her presence might produce on her father. Ralph was sent to ascertain, if possible, the destination of the fugitives; and having succeeded in insinuating himself into the confidence of one of Fitzgerald's agents, he returned in a short time with the information, that they might probably be found at a village inn, at no great distance from the Springs. Westall's next care was to determine to whom he should apply to undertake so delicate an embassy, and while he was deliberating, Ellen said, “go yourself, I beseech you, Mr. Westall. Ralph and I can do every thing here, and you, and you alone can persuade Miss Redwood to return—to return,” she added, with a faltering voice, “before it is too late.” “Alas! my dear Ellen,” replied Westall, glancing his eye at Mr. Redwood, who after a paroxysm of raving had sunk on his pillow, pale and exhausted, “it is I fear already too late.” “Oh, do not say so—it may not be—” said Ellen, and she bent over her father with a look of great anxiety, then turning suddenly to Westall, “we may at least,” she said, “save Caroline from the disgrace that must fall on her, if it is known that she has deserted her father in this extremity.” “Generous being!” exclaimed Westall, “you shall be obeyed, but I cannot leave you here alone.” “Ask Grace Campbell then, to come to me—but no,” she added, looking towards the bed and observing that her father was sinking to sleep, “perfect quiet will be best—now go, and God speed you.” Westall departed, admiring with enthusiasm (as lovers are wont to admire the virtues that belong to the objects of their tenderness) the self-command of Ellen, and the generosity with which she could forego, at this crisis of her life, the indulgence of her sensibilities, to consider how she might preserve the honor of one who had so relentlessly inflicted suffering on her. The moment Westall left her, Ellen sent the servant into an adjoining room that she might avoid the risk of breaking her father's slumbers by the slightest noise. Hour after hour she sate on his bedside, gently chafing his icy hands, wiping the cold dew from his forehead, and noting every breath he struggled to inhale, and every convulsive motion of his distorted features. At length his feverishness abated — he ceased to be restless—the firm grasp of his hand relaxed — a gentle warmth was diffused throughout his system, and his respiration became quiet as an infant's. Ellen raised her hands and eyes in silent and devout thankfulness, and withdrawing from the bed, she took from her bosom her mother's letter, and opened it with a mingled feeling of awe, of apprehension, and of tenderness. Could it be otherwise? it was the record of the wrongs of her departed mother first to be learned in the presence of her dying father. Repeatedly she fixed her eyes on the letter, but they were so dimmed with her tears, that she could not distinguish one word from another. At last an intense interest in her mother's fate subdued every other feeling, and she succeeded in reading the letter which will be found in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. Methinks if ye would know How visitations of calamity Affect the pious soul, 'tis shown ye there!” Southey. “My Child — If the injunction is obeyed with which I shall consign to my friend the box that is to contain this letter, long before you behold it the hand that now traces these lines will have mouldered to dust—the eye that now, as you lie on my bosom, pours its tears like rain upon your sweet face, shall weep no more for ever; and the heart that now throbs with hopes and fears for you, my love, shall have ceased to beat with mortal anxieties and mortal hopes. “Sweet innocent — gift of God — image of immaculate purity — thy mother would preserve thee, an unsullied treasure for the riches of Christ's kingdom—a stainless flower for the paradise of God: thy mother would shelter thee so that the winds of heaven should not breathe unkindly on thee. But this cannot be. Thou must be exposed to the dangers of human life, solicited by its temptations, and pierced by its sorrows—and thy mother, thy natural guard and shield, must be taken from thee. Thy mother can do nothing for thee—— Said I nothing!—God forgive me. I can do—I have done all things—I have resigned you to Him whose protection is safety—whose favour is life. I have believed his promises—I have accepted his offered mercy; and in faith, and nothing wavering, I have committed my orphan child to Him. And now, though thy path should be laid through the waters, they shall not overwhelm thee, and through the fire, it shall not kindle upon thee. “My child, I am now to account to you for a resolution, which, should it please God to preserve your life, must materially affect your future destiny. “I beseech you to permit no unkind thoughts of your mother to enter your gentle bosom. Remember that if I deprive you of your rights, degrade you from the station in which you were born, and remove you from honours and riches, it is that you may become an `heir of the kingdom;' remember my motive—read the brief history and unhappy fate of your mother, and you will not—must not blame her. “My father's name was Philip Erwine. He was a Scotchman by birth, the only son of a rich and respectable family. He was educated for the church, and preparing to enter life with the most happy prospects, when they were for ever clouded by a clandestine marriage, which the world deemed imprudent, and his father unpardonable, with a portionless, obscure girl, whose maiden name, Ellen Bruce, I have given to you. My grandfather discarded his son from his home and his affections, and only cherished the remembrance of this one act of disobedience. Oh my child, the pride of this world is cruel tyranny! “My father subsisted for some months on scanty remittances secretly made him by his mother; but she died soon after. My grandfather married again—had more children—and my father, thus cut off from all hope of reconciliation, emigrated to America. My parents were strangers in a strange land, and obliged to meet the evils which the poor and friendless must always encounter. My father, nursed in the lap of indulgence, sunk under privation, and became utterly spiritless and dejected. My noble mother, with an `inborn royalty of mind' that makes the trappings of VOL. III. M earthly distinctions seem poor indeed, endured all her trials without a murmuring word, or even look. She made incredible exertions for the support of her family, and maintained an outward cheerfulness, while her heart was sinking with the consciousness of having been the cause of my father's calamities. Her health and life were the sacrifice. I have since heard my father confess that when he laid her in the grave, he was first roused to a sense of my wants and his duties. “He left New-York, the scene of his sufferings, and fixed his residence in a village on Long-Island Sound. There he obtained a comfortable living by teaching the children of some gentlemen whose summer residences were in the vicinage. Whenever he was compelled to be absent from me, I was left in the care—the vigilant, maternal care, of the kindest-hearted woman in the world, who afterwards married a Mr. Allen, and went to reside in Massachusetts. I was the constant companion of my father's solitude—the consolation, he called me, of his exile. All the treasure of his heart was lavished on me: I was the refuge of his affections, and nurtured with a thoughtful tenderness that quite disqualified me for the indifference of a selfish world—quite unfitted me for the rude storm that has since assailed me, and before which I have fallen. “My father was a good man: adversity had made him an humble Christian: still he possessed the pride natural to the human heart, and I, his only child, was the object of all that pride. Yes, my love, he was proud of thy mother's beauty—that fatal beauty that has been the source of all my griefs—that beauty which is now perishing by disease, and soon will be quite effaced by death. Thank God, I was never proud of it: in my simplicity, I was ignorant of its value and its danger. M 2 “My father would sometimes bewail for me the loss of distinctions, which were no loss to me, for I had never known them; and in the joyous independence of childhood, I could frolic away his sadness, and prove to him, by the contentment of my spirit, the vanity of his desires. “I had just attained my fourteenth year when I lost my father. I pass over that period of my life. My support —my defence was taken from me—the world was all before me, and I would gladly have turned back and laid me in my father's grave. Thank heaven, my child, there is a misery you cannot feel! “My father did not leave me without a provision. Tender as the parent bird that plucks the down from its own breast to feather the nest for its young, he had practised the severest economy—deprived himself of every, the least indulgence, that he might reserve his small earnings for my sake. “Mrs. Allen, to whose guardianship my father had left me, sent me to a boarding-school to acquire some slight accomplishments, which she hoped, with the solid instruction I had already received, would qualify me for a teacher, and thus secure to me the means of permanent independence. I had been one year at school—my education was finished, or rather my small means were expended, when a Mrs. Westall came with her husband from Virginia to visit her northern friends. Though some years older than I, we had been playmates in our childhood. She remembered with kindness our youthful intimacy. My youth and loneliness interested her husband's benevolent heart: he invited me to accompany his wife to the south, and promised, if I became dissatisfied with my home in his family, to obtain for me among his rich neighbours an agreeable situation as teacher. “Now, my child, your mother claims your pity, your sympathy, your forgiveness, while you read the record of an indiscretion that casts her into an early grave, and condemns you to orphanage. “The day after our arrival at Mr. Westall's plantation, I had stolen just at sunset into the garden with my friend's little boy, Charles Westall—the thought of this child throws a bright gleam across the track of memory, and I pause to dwell on it as the traveller in a desert lingers to pluck a sweet and solitary flower. Scarcely less a child than himself, I was the favourite companion of his sports. He had chased me through the walks, and having caught me, he made me kneel on a turfed bank, that he might, as he said, crown me his queen. He pulled the comb from my hair, and was weaving knots of honey-suckles and rosebuds among my curls, when we were startled by the rustling of the branches of some high shrubs behind which we had retreated. We both looked up and perceived a gentleman, a stranger, gazing intently on us. “Little Charles sportively drew the branches around me, saying, `this is my Mary, my queen—and nobody shall look on her till she is crowned.”' “`Such a nymph,' said the stranger, `should have a guardian angel and a sylvan veil.' “These were the first words I ever heard from your father; this was the first time I ever saw him, and from this moment he was never absent from my thoughts: wherever I was, in society or in solitude, Henry Redwood's voice rung in my ears; his image was for ever before me. Look, my child, at the picture which you will find with this letter: look on those eyes—the lofty brow—the mouth—and then imagine what his face must have been, when kindled with the inspiration of the living spirit. “I was young and ignorant—artless and unsuspicious—constantly exposed to the charms of his genius and accomplishments—to the fascinations of his tenderness—and if I had ever doubted (which I did not) that he was all that he seemed, his being the friend of Mr. Westall would have quieted my fears. “Here I have paused to look over what I have written, and I blush at my own inconsistency. I blame myself, and yet I seek a justification in my child's eyes; this is natural, for alas! the heart is deceitful. But I will do so no more—I will tell the simple truth, and trust to my child's heart to plead for her mother. “Not many months elapsed before I married Mr. Redwood clandestinely, and without much scruple or reluctance. Every sentiment of duty and propriety was lost in the fervour of a first attachment, and in the fearless confidence which youth and love inspired. “He urged the necessity of secresy, and assigned many reasons for it. I received them implicitly, or scarcely listened to them, for I had cast the care of my honour and happiness upon him, and my affection was unclouded by a single doubt or anxiety. “Soon after our marriage, Mr. Westall died suddenly—the kindness of Mrs. Westall detained me with her for some time: I then left her to take charge of the children of a Mr. Emlyn, whose plantation adjoined that of my husband's father. Our opportunities of meeting, though somewhat diminished by my residence with strangers, were still frequent, but they exposed me to suspicions and remarks that made me miserable. “The last time I saw my husband I confessed my anxieties to him. I even hinted my expectation of your existence; that I believe he did not understand, and I had not courage to explain myself. I observed that he felt unusual emotion at parting with me, and the next morning I received the information that he had gone on a tour of pleasure to Europe, to M 3 be absent one or two years. With this intelligence, which almost deprived me of my senses, your father sent me, by mistake, some letters that had passed between him and one of his friends, from which I discovered that while he felt some tenderness for me, he regretted that he had encumbered himself with an insuperable obstacle to his advancement in the world. “He was the world to me—and I found myself worse than insignificant to him. Every fibre of my affections was clasped around him, and I was thus in a moment rudely torn away: poverty I had never dreaded — calamity in any other shape I could have borne—but I merited the chastisement. I also discovered from these fatal letters that your father was an unbeliever; not merely that he rejected the truths of revelation, but that he could even treat a future retribution and the hope of immortality as childish illusions. “Oh, how then, in the bitterness of my sorrow and disappointment, did I blame myself that I had so long forgotten my Christian duty, and had looked upon my husband's indifference to religion (for his unbelief I never suspected,) as what was to be expected in a young man. My child, I deserved my fate—I was born of a Christian mother, watched and guided by a Christian father—religious principles were deeply rooted in my heart; and yet for awhile every thought of duty was suspended—every affection was melted into one deep absorbing passion—my whole existence was resolved into one sensation—alas, this it is to love! “As soon as I became sufficiently tranquil to think of the future, I took a resolution to go to Philadelphia, without any very definite purpose but to hide myself from every one who had ever seen me, and to escape from a scene where every object renewed my anguish, and where I was no longer capable of performing the duties I had undertaken. “Oh that terrible journey!—I was alone and unprotected, and so young and so wretched, that every body noticed me, and I had such mortifications and trials to endure! But I will not make your heart bleed by relating them—why should I? they are past for ever. “The journey was fatiguing to me— my sorrows preyed on my health, and before I reached Philadelphia, I was seized with a nervous fever, which obliged me to remain at a German settlement. I recovered partially from it, but it left my mind in a state of alternate apathy and insensibility, which rendered removal impossible. I hired a lodging in a very poor German family, where I awaited my confinement. I was careless about my life, and took no thought for my health, which ordinary attention might perhaps have restored, but long fastings and sleepless nights, when my weary spirit knew no rest, have wasted my strength; and now I would give worlds for a little space of that life which my wilful neglect, and my guilty despair have destroyed. “Your birth, awakened me to a new existence—breathed a new spirit into me—created ties to life; and from the first moment I folded you to my bosom, I would have accepted existence on any terms: no condition, however deserted and neglected, has now any terrors for me. All other feelings and desires are extinguished in the pure flame of maternal love, and for you, my child, alone I would live. “But it cannot be—a terrible cough racks my frame—the fires of consumption are kindled on my cheek, and every day I see and feel the steady and sure approach of death—I weep over you, and the kind creatures that are about me weep to see me, and the long silent watches of the night I pass in praying for you. “In my still solitude, when thou wast sleeping all unconscious on my bosom, I have heard a voice saying unto me, `leave thy child with me.' I have obeyed the voice—I have resigned you to the protection of that good Being, who in tender compassion hast declared himself the orphan's God. “And now it is deeply impressed on my mind that I ought to do something to preserve my lamb from the danger of wandering from the fold of the good Shepherd. Your father, by deserting me, has forfeited his right to you. When I am no longer in the way of his worldly prospects, his heart may be touched with compunction for the wrong he has done me; you might awaken a parent's feelings, and he might invest you with your rights. “All this might be—and what would you gain? the unwilling sufferance—the scanty favour, it may be, of a proud and selfish family; for such, from the confession of your father, are his connexions. But for this shall I expose you to the danger, the almost inevitable certainty, of alienation from the christian hope? “It must not be—I behold something in your innocent face—the emblem of heaven—I feel something in the soft touch of your little hand that appeals to your mother's heart to direct your course in the path that leads to the mansions in our Father's house. “I have at last taken an immoveable resolution to keep your existence a secret from your father, and to preserve from you, and from every one, the knowledge of my connexion with him till you are of an age when you will be secure from his influence—when your character will be formed by wise and christian care. “You must not, my child, think hardly of me for keeping you so long in ignorance of your parentage—I dare not leave any thing to hazard—the very young do not know how to choose good from evil, and heaven preserve you from the hard school of experience in which your poor mother has been taught!” Here there occurred a blank in the letter; and the remainder (scarcely legible) was as follows:— “Since writing the above, I have been too weak to use my pen. In the meantime my kind, generous, best friend, Mrs. Allen, has complied with a request I sent her, and come to me from her distant home. Ah, how has she grieved to find me so sick, and in this mean lodging; but I have not suffered from its poverty, and I chose it that I might not diminish the pittance I have saved for you—the remnant of the liberal supply my husband sent me at his departure. “I have found in this humble dwelling all the kindness I needed, and have enjoyed an inward peace that springs from the reflection that I have for you, my child, sacrificed earth to heaven. “Mrs. Allen remonstrates with me. I see that she thinks I have been so long lonely and sorrowful that my mind is not quite right, but she is mistaken— I am sure she is mistaken. She tells me that I may involve you in many embarrassments—she suggests a thousand difficulties that may occur, but I cannot consider them now—I cannot go back to the world—my thoughts are all the other way. “She does not oppose me any longer, but has most solemnly promised to fulfil my wishes, though she still calls them strange and singular. She says I am young—I am young in years, but in the last twelvemonths I have grown very old. Oh to the wretched, hours are years, and weeks are ages! “She begs me to be governed by her discretion, but I cannot. “She knows not—no one knows— how to look upon the troubled and vanishing dream of this life, till the light of another falls upon it. No one knows how mean every thing that is transient and perishable appears to me—how insignificant the joys, nay even the sufferings that are past, as I stand trembling on the verge of that bright world of innocence and safety, where I hope to appear with the child God has given me. “My last prayer will be for you, my child—and for your father—God have mercy on him!” Every word of this letter, which may appear very long and tedious to an indifferent reader, sunk deep into Ellen's heart. It seemed to her as if the book of Providence was unsealed and open before her, and as the bright light fell on the path by which she had been led to the present period of her existence, `Oh my mother!' she exclaimed, `hast thou not been with me a guardian spirit to lead me by the way which was disclosed to thy prophetic eye?” Her emotions were deep and indescribable—stronger than any other were gratitude to her mother, and admiration of the courage and single-heartedness with which she had renounced the world for her. “I might,” she thought, “like Caroline, have been the slave of the world— the victim of folly: I might have followed my poor father through the dark and dreary passages of unbelief, but for that good part which my sainted mother chose for me.” A thousand reflections crowded on her mind: but gratitude for the past—her own bright hopes of the future—every other feeling was soon lost in an extreme solicitude for her father's recovery. She knelt by his bed-side—But there are feelings too sacred to be drawn from their silent sanctuary—there are services too hallowed to be described. They are seen in secret, and rewarded, as Ellen's were, openly. We must now recur to Caroline, who, on re-entering her own room, was startled by the spectacle of her dressing-case, the lid open, and pacquet and purse gone. She seized the dressing-case, emptied out every article it contained, in the vain hope that in some corner the treasure might lurk, but fruitless was the search, and she dropped it and burst into tears. “Oh,” she said, “had the wretch taken any thing else—my money—my trinkets—any thing but this—the loss of this may ruin me.” While she was thus bewailing her calamity, she heard a gentle tap at the door, and on opening it Ellen appeared. Caroline started back, and said haughtily, “Has Westall sent you to me, Miss Bruce?—I could have dispensed with this favour.” “No, Miss Redwood,” replied Ellen, advancing into the room with an air of dignity and gentleness, “I have come here on my own errand—Caroline, your” —here for the first time there was a slight tremulousness in her voice, and after a moment's pause, she added, “our father”— “You have it then?” shrieked Caroline. “Yes,” replied Ellen, “I have it— Providence has restored to me my right; but you, Caroline have nothing to fear from me—let the past be for ever forgotten. Our father, Mr. Westall, and myself, are all that know where these precious documents were found: and is not the secret safe with us? We are the persons most concerned for your honour —are we not? Forget the past then, and regard me without fear or distrust.” Caroline was touched with Ellen's generosity, and deeply mortified, for the moment at least, at the wrong she had done her. “I never meant,” she said, as soon as she could command her voice sufficiently to put the words together, though in the most embarrassed and stammering manner, “I never meant, Ellen, to keep those papers from you for ever. I do not believe I should have kept them so long, but I thought that you could not suffer from the loss of that which you were ignorant you possessed; and I knew that when papa discovered you were his child, he would care nothing for me. It was uncertain, you know, for a long time, which of us Westall preferred, and though I have since felt a perfect indifference for him, I did then wish—at least I should not have disliked his addresses, and I was sure if papa knew all, he would throw his influence into your scale, and then Charles Westall would have no reason for preferring me, as, your rights acknowledged, your fortune would be equal to mine, and that I could not but think very unfair, as nearly all papa's fortune came from my mother, and yours, you know, was quite pennyless.” Self-justification is the natural tribute even in the most hopeless circumstances, to the law of rectitude written on the heart. Lame and impotent as was Caroline's attempt to justify herself, Ellen replied without appearing to notice any of its inconsistencies. “You have not,” she said, “rightly judged me, Caroline. If you could have imagined the joy—the gratitude I have felt this evening, you would not, I am sure you would not have deferred my happiness. My mother's name is vindicated—sanctified my faith has always held it; but it is now beyond the reach of suspicion or imputation. You know not, Caroline, how should you know! the dreadful solitude of living without a natural tie to your fellow-creatures. You know not the exquisite sensations I have felt this night, even amidst afflicting fears, beside my father's bed.” Ellen's emotion checked her utterance for a moment: she then added, “Caroline, it is best that we should understand one another perfectly. Your mother's fortune is as entirely yours as if I had never had an existence. I have not the right, and certainly, I have not the wish to interfere with your inheritance in the smallest degree. All that I covet, is an equal share of our father's affections: your confidence I hope to win; your sisterly affection I will try to deserve.” After a short pause, Ellen added in conclusion, “there is one arrangement, Caroline, which, if I insist on controlling, you must not think I too soon assume the rights of an elder sister. It is my wish that our relationship should remain a secret for the present.” Caroline looked astonished. Ellen, without seeming to notice her surprise, proceeded, “in the present state of my feelings I wish particularly to avoid observation and remark. The avowal of my engagement with Mr. Westall, and your friendship, will give me a right to share with you the care of our father. Should he not recover, the secret shall never be divulged—it is enough that I know it—for worlds I would not cast a shadow over his fair name.” In assigning her motives, Ellen had avoided any reference to what she knew must be Caroline's wishes on the subject. Caroline felt this delicacy to her heart's core; she was subdued by the pure goodness of Ellen; she felt the influence of the holy principle that governed her sister's mind, and penetrated with a poignant contrition like that which made the Egyptian king exclaim, VOL. III. N `truly, I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you;' she sunk on her knees—the pride and haughtiness of her soul were vanquished—she stretched out her arms with an almost oriental abjectness. Ellen raised her and clasped her arms around her. It may not be too much to say, that the beautiful sisters were a spectacle at which heaven might rejoice; for they seemed to embody penitence and perfect love. “Oh, Ellen!” exclaimed Caroline, as soon as she could speak, “is it possible that you will not after all triumph over me? Can you forgive my slights—my insults? Can you forget the wrong I have done you?” “All is forgiven—all forgotten,” replied Ellen; “think no more of it, Caroline. Let us now think of nothing but how we shall best minister to our father's restoration; for this we will unite our hearts and efforts. Let us go together to his room.” “Yes, I will go—I will do every thing you ask of me, Ellen,” said Caroline; “but first tell me, for I never can speak on the subject again, first tell me where those papers were found. Did Lilly give them to you?” Ellen could not satisfy Caroline's curiosity to know the particulars of her servant's unfaithfulness. She could inform her that the pacquet had been found in her apartment. The truth was, that Lilly, during her northern summer, had formed too intimate an acquaintance with `the mountain nymph, sweet liberty,' and had conceived too strong a friendship for her to be willing ever again to leave her dominions. She had, too, in imitation of her mistress, been carrying on a snug love affair of her own with the servant of a N 2 West India planter then at Lebanon. Miss Redwood's clandestine arrangement were the signal for the execution of Lilly's plans, and they afforded an insurance from the danger of immediate pursuit—the only security she needed. Lebanon is a border town, and the boundary line of New York once passed and Massachusetts entered, Lilly was assured of the protecting hospitalities of the people of her own colour; and it had even been hinted to her that in case her retreat was discovered, the white inhabitants would be very backward to enforce her master's rights. Thus encouraged, Lilly availed herself of the propitious moment of Caroline's departure, subtracted the purse from the dressing case, and not wishing to encumber herself with any superfluity, she left the dressing-case, and in her haste left it open, and made good her retreat. What particular grounds there might have been in this instance for the intimations given to Lilly, we cannot say; but it must be confessed, that our northern people are quite careless of the duty of protecting slave property, and that they manifest a provoking indifference to the rights and losses of slaveholders. Indeed, so notorious is their fault in this particular, that their southern brethren seldom run the risk of an irrecoverable loss by exposing their servants to the danger of an atmosphere infected with freedom; and those among them who possess the greatest abundance of these riches, which emphatically take to themselves wings and fly away, prudently make their northern tours attended by white servants. The sisters found their way through the dimly lighted passages to their father's apartment. Westall met them at the door; he perceived, at a single glance, that all was right between them. “Thank heaven,” said he, “you are both here; your father has just pronounced your names.” “Is he conscious?” whispered Ellen. “I do not know; but he seems quite calm and refreshed.” Caroline and Ellen approached the bed together. Mr. Redwood looked at them with an expression of surprise and inquiry, and a slight convulsion agitated his face. They both bent over him and kissed him. He joined their hands, clasped them in his, and raised his eyes —peace, gratitude, and devotion, spoke in them. He said nothing; he seemed to fear the effort to speak. After a few moments he relinquished the hands of his children and closed his eyes. Tears stole through his eye lids, and a sweet serenity overspread his countenance. “This is heaven's own peace,” whispered Westall; “the world cannot give it—the world cannot take it away.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so his rising senses Began to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle His clearer reason. Tempest. Heaven hath a hand in these events. King John. The night and its afflictions, which we have just faithfully recorded, passed away, and joy came with the morning. Mr. Redwood's condition was already much amended. He experienced, to its full extent, the restorative power of happiness. His disease had been more moral than physical, and it yielded to moral influences. Without superstition one might have believed that Ellen possessed a `healing gift,' so beneficent was the effect of her vigilant care. She was constantly at her father's bedside, ministering to his mind and body, and performing all those tender and soothing offices which the sick so often feel to be more efficacious than the most skilfully compounded drugs. She never left her father's room but for the purpose of renovating her strength and spirits by a few turns on the piazza with Westall. If her lover ever thought that her filial duty abstracted her too much from the reciprocation of their mutual feelings, (a natural jealousy, for a man is never satisfied without expressing what a woman is content with feeling,) he was quite consoled when, during these brief interviews, he listened to the detail of her feelings in relation to himself—of her hopes and misgivings; in short, to that whole history of the heart which is such delightful music to the lover's ear—and such very dull music to every other. Ellen communicated to Mrs. Westall and Miss Campbell the discovery of her parentage. Both, as might have been expected, received the intelligence with inexpressible delight: all human happiness must be qualified, and that of the two ladies was considerably abated by Ellen's injunction to temporary secresy, and by her passing without the slightest notice over the particulars that led to the discovery. After Ellen had concluded her communication, and had received the embraces and congratulations of her friends, Grace Campbell's smiles triumphed over the tears with which they had been conflicting, and she turned to Mrs. Westall and said, “Well, my dear madam, I suppose you and I must put down all of mother Eve within us, for no evil spirit will enter this paradise that Ellen has conjured about her, to devise ways and means to relieve our curiosity.” N 3 “And, my dear friends,” said Ellen, “I am sure you will be content to endure that curiosity which could only be relieved by an evil spirit.” “Oh, I don't know—at any rate, I had rather not be tempted,” replied Miss Campbell. “But, my dear Ellen, as we are not permitted to see the ring or lamp—the magic means, whatever they may be, by which you have attained the happy finale of your fairy tale—do gratify me in one particular—suffer me to produce a grand sensation once in my life—allow me to proclaim you Ellen Redwood before the world and in the presence of your disdainful sister?” “I cannot.” “And why not?” “Because, my sister is no longer disdainful, but kind and affectionate; and besides, my dear Grace, you know that I have a rustic aversion to notoriety; and more than all that, our arrangements are already made. Should my father continue to convalesce as rapidly as he has done for the last four-and-twenty hours, he will be able to leave here on Thursday next, one week from this day—the day appointed for the departure of your party. Caroline and Fitzgerald are to be married, quite privately, in my father's room, on Wednesday morning, and are to proceed immediately to Canada; and I am to resign the place your aunt kindly offered me in her carriage, and, with your leave, Mrs. Westall, am to occupy that which Caroline vacates in our father's.” “A most delightful arrangement,” exclaimed Mrs. Westall. “A delightful arrangement to you ladies doubtless,” said Miss Campbell; “but I confess I do not feel particularly flattered that Ellen should sever herself from our party with so much nonchalance, and form her exquisite plans without the slightest reference to us.” “You have not heard all our plans, my dear Grace,” replied Ellen, with slight embarrassment; “we have been compelled by the necessity of the case to form them hastily: my father has expressed a wish that Caroline and I should be married at the same time; to this I could not consent; my duty to Mrs. Harrison — my affection for her, forbids it. My father is making an effort to go to Lansdown, that he may see my beloved friend, and express his gratitude for her maternal kindness to his child.” Ellen hesitated, and Miss Campbell said, “this is all very pretty and very proper, but still there is no consolation for my self-love.” “You have not heard Ellen out, Miss Campbell,” interposed Mrs. Westall; “the most agreeable part of all these arrangements is yet to come; a part, which in right of Charles Westall's mother, I have already been consulted on. My dear Ellen, I will take pity on your girlish reluctance to come to the point, and just tell Miss Campbell, in direct terms, that your wedding is to be celebrated at Lansdown, on the first day of September.” “Since Mrs. Westall has helped me on so far, my dear Grace,” said Ellen, “I will come to that point to which all this preamble has tended, and in as direct terms as Mrs. Westall's, beg the favour of you to persuade your aunt to accommodate her progress to our snail's pace, in order that I may have your support as my bride's-maid.” “Thank you, thank you, Ellen. Now I can perceive that your arrangements are all delightful. Persuade my aunt! —bless her, I can persuade her to anything; and if I could not, I would poison the horses—bribe the coachman to turn the carriage off some of your northern precipices—any thing for the pleasure of seeing you married to Charles Westall.” After an instant's pause Miss Campbell added, “in romance all the business of life ends with a wedding, but in real life that seems to be the starting point. Now, as I am a little worldly in my views, I should like to know, Ellen, whether you and Westall are going to set up housekeeping in the Harrison mansion, and live upon love and verses, as Miss Debby would say?” “Ellen assured Miss Campbell that she had no such romantic views, that on the contrary all due respect had been paid to their temporal affairs. She informed her that on account of Mr. Redwood's health, they were to pass the winter in Virginia—that in the Spring they were to return to New-England— that Mr. Westall was then to form a partnership which had long been projected with an eminent lawyer, and enter upon the business of his profession. “My prudence is quite satisfied,” said Miss Campbell, when Ellen had concluded: “and now, my dear friend, “tell me, are you never to appear as Ellen Redwood?” “My father insists on my bearing that name from the moment we leave Lebanon” “That is as it should be,” said Miss Campbell—and the ladies separated. “Fitzgerald, who had felt himself at the mercy of events which he could not control, passed a week of impatience and anxiety: but a week, though `it may be tedious, cannot be long,' and the day arrived that was to assure his right to Caroline Redwood. There were some indications that it might not have been impossible to persuade the young lady to retract her engagement, but it seems that her friends did not deem it expedient to interfere, for they never spoke to her upon the subject. “Ten o'clock was the time appointed for the marriage ceremony, and at that hour Fitzgerald led Caroline into her father's apartment. Ellen, Westall, and his mother were there, awaiting them. Mr. Redwood was sitting on his easy-chair, his health and spirits obviously and surprisingly renovated. He had summoned all his fortitude for the occasion; but he shuddered when he saw his daughter come into his presence for the last time, and thought of the probable destiny to which he was about to resign her. She had never looked so lovely as at this moment —the events of the preceding week had softened her heart, and touched her beautiful face with a moral expression. Mr. Redwood received Fitzgerald with politeness, rather chilled by extreme reserve. He drew Caroline to him, and put his arm round her—“My dear child,” he said, “before the clergyman is admitted, I have somewhat to say to you. We have already exchanged forgiveness—mutual it should not have been, but that you made it so, for my parental faults met with their just retribution in your breach of filial duty—that is all past, and we will forget it if we can. “Caroline, I have made Ellen acquainted with your generous wish that a large portion of your fortune should be conveyed to her; but Ellen is a nice casuist, and she has convinced me that I have no right to make any disposition of a property which descends to you from her mother.” “Oh, Ellen!” whispered Caroline to her sister, “will you not allow me to make some atonement to you?” “My dear Caroline,” replied Ellen, “if I needed an atonement, your kindness and confidence are an ample one— that I have accepted — I can accept no other.” “My small patrimonial inheritance,” resumed Mr. Redwood, “has been increased by the legacy of an uncle, and though my fortune is still moderate, it is quite adequate to my own wants, and to Ellen's very maderate desires. Captain Fitzgerald, my dear Caroline, must pardon me, if I avail myself of my right to remain your steward during my life. The income of your fortune shall be regularly transmitted to you, wherever your husband's destiny may take you. God grant that the restoration of peace to his country may enable him to perform his promise to resign his commission, and come and reside among us.” After a brief pause, Mr. Redwood continued, “I am now going, my dear child, to bestow on you an inestimable treasure,” he put into her hands the Bible he had received from Ellen, “this your sister gave to me with prophetic benevolence—she knows that her purpose has been accomplished—the dark shadows of unbelief have passed from my mind for ever— the terrors that threatened to annihilate my reason are vanquished—the life-giving truths, and immortal hopes of that book have translated me from darkness to light. My friends,” he added with increased energy, “you know not what it is to endure the evils of life with the horrible belief that the grave is the place of final extinction —of eternal death; neither can you know,” and a divine joy seemed to illuminate his countenance, “neither can you know the rest of my wearied spirit —the gratitude I feel to the blessed Redeemer— the resurrection and the life.” He was silent for a moment and then said, “receive my blessing, my child, and remember that it is my last injunction, that you make this book your guide.” Caroline, deeply affected, knelt before her father—Ellen sunk on her knees beside her, and clasping her arm around her sister, she raised her tearful eyes to Mr. Redwood, “severed — strangers,” she said, “as we have been on earth, we may yet be a family in heaven.” “God grant it, my children!” responded her father fervently, and for a few moments he bent his head in silence over his daughters: he then raised them, gave Caroline's hand to Fitzgerald and Ellen's to Westall. The clergyman was summoned —the nuptial ceremony performed —Caroline received the farewell embraces of her friends, and left them for ever. We fancied we had finished our humble labours, when by a lucky chance a letter, written by Deborah Lenox, and addressed to Mrs. Charles Westall, —, Massachusetts, fell into our hands. As it was written nearly two years subsequent to the date of these memoirs, and contained some interesting notices of the personages that figure in them, we immediately transmitted it to our printer. It was sent back with a respectful request from the compositors of the press, (those accomplished orthographers) that the spelling might be rectified. In reward of their patient toil in our behalf, it has been deemed a duty to gratify their fastidiousness, and Deborah's epistle has been reluctantly re-written—letters have been transposed, subtracted, and added, and we believe its orthography is now quite perfect. In no other way would we consent to alter it, for we respect the peculiarities of our honest friend, and are willing to have the sybil with her contortions. “Eton, Vermont state, 20th July, in the year of our Lord 18—. “My dear Ellen, “I guess you will be surprised to see my pot-hooks and trammels, and puzzled enough you will be to read them; but I could not let so good an opportunity pass without letting you know that the Lord has spared our lives to this date, and that all your friends at Eton are well, except the minister, who enjoys a poor state of health. “The reason you do not receive a letter from sister Lenox by this opportunity, is, that she does not know of it, on account of her having journeyed to New-York to meet George and his bride, who we hear, though she has the disadvantage of being born and bred at the south, is as likely and prudent and and notable a woman as if she had the good fortune to be brought up in New-England, which leads a reflecting person to consider that it is best to lay aside their prepossessions, and to believe that there are good people every where. I did not expect George would have got over his disappointment so soon; but he has acted a rational part, for it stands to reason that a man can find more than one woman in the world to make him happy; that is to say, if he can't get cake, he had better take up with gingerbread. “But before I go any farther, I ought to finish giving you the reasons why you must put up with a letter from such a poor scribe as I am, instead of receiving one from any of the rest of the family, who all write, Lucy and all, coarse hand and fine, very nicely. The girls are busy, excepting Lucy, preparing tea for our grand visitors. James's wife, kind-hearted little soul that she is, has gone to fix off Peggy; and Lucy is at knitting society, which has lately been established in aid of the pious youth at the Cornwall school, and foreign and domestic missions. So you see, my dear Ellen, I e'en have to put my hand to the plough. “You and I never did a better chore than getting Emily back among us: it would gladden your heart to see her old grandmother, who is truly a new creature, and owns, like Job, that she is more blessed at the end than at the beginning. Emily makes a first-rate wife, which I take to be partly owing to her having learnt many prudent and prospering ways among them shakers; and I do think if they could be prevailed on to turn their settlement into a school to bring up young folks for the married state, they would be a blessing to the world, instead of a spectacle to show how much wisdom and how much folly may be mixed up together. “Little Peggy came here this morning, with a basket of new-fashioned early beans, a present from Deacon Martin to me; the deacon and I have had a strife which should have the first beans, and he has won the race; and by the way, I do not believe you have heard about the deacon's marriage, which has made quite a stirring time here at Eton. You must know that a few weeks after the deacon lost his wife, he felt so lonesome without a companion that he came to sister Lenox to recommend a suitable one, and she directly spoke a good word for Peggy's aunt Betty, who is, as it were, alone in the world, and though a poor body, she comes of creditable stock in the old countries; and what is more to the purpose, her walk and conversation among us has been as good as a preachedsermon—that is to say, a moral discourse. Well, the deacon was quite taken with the notion, for Betty is a comely woman to look to yet, though well nigh on to fifty, and he went diectly to lay the matter before some of the church-members, and they made atrong objections to the match, on account of Betty's so often breaking the third commandment, which comes, I suppose, of her being brought up in Old England, where they are by no means so particular about teaching the youth their catechise as with us. The deacon, however, had set his face as a flint, and there were consultations about it, till at last two of the brethren agreed to go and talk to VOL. III. O Betty on the subject, and make her promise that she would put a tight rein on her tongue. “Betty promised every thing they asked; but you know when a body always goes in the same track it makes a deep rut, and it is next to an impossibility to turn out of it: and so, while Betty was talking with them, every other sentence was `God help us, gentlemen,' and `God bless your souls, I'll do my best,' and so on; and they came away more dead set against the match than ever. But Martin went on in spite of them, and married her; and except in the matter of the third commandment, there is not a more exemplary deacon's wife in the state than Betty makes. “But I shall never come to the end of my letter, if I go on at this rate. I find that the older I grow, the more I love to talk; and some how or other I always did love, above all things, to hold discourse with you, Ellen. To go back then to my last starting point. I emptied out Peggy's basket and went to open the door for her, and what should I see but a fine coach with a noble span of horses turning up to our gate, and who of all the people in the world should be in it but Mr. Fenton Campbell and his wife, Grace Campbell that was! “I did not know her at first glance, for she is dressed in deep mourning for her uncle Richard Campbell, who has died lately; sorry enough, I dare say, to leave all his other accounts to go to his last one. However, the moment she smiled one of her own beautiful smiles, as bright as the sun at mid-day. I knew her, and she sprung out of the carriage and was on the door-step at a bound, and shaking both my hands, just with that warm-hearted way of hers, she came in and sat down, and directly we fell to talking of you, and our tongues went as spry as that old woman's, who, as a humoursome gentleman said, had hers fastened in the middle that it might run at both ends! “Peggy's ear is always nailed the minute she hears your name, and she kept drawing closer and closer to us, and at last the poor thing began to cry; and when Mrs. Campbell made some inquiries about her, and when she heard her story, and learned that you wished Peggy to go and live with you as soon as her aunt would spare her, and that her aunt had given her consent,and tha Peggy was only waiting for an opportunity, and was all on tiptoe for it, she just spoke a word to her husband, and then told Peggy that if she would be ready in the morning, she would take her to you. I thought the child would have gone clean out of her wits with joy: her eyes, the blind one as well as the other, looked as if they would have danced out of her head; she clapped her hands, and whirled around, and fell on her knees, and kissed Mrs. Campbell's gown—poor thing! she is too feeling a creature for this world; and I am thankful she is going to you, Ellen, who know all about feelings, and can temper hers. “I don't well see where Mrs. Campbell will stow the child away, for her carriage is filled with all sorts of notions, and a large kind of pocket-books which they call port-folios, and which Mrs. Campbell says are filled with her husband's drawings, for they have been to the falls, and to Quebec, and so on, and you know painting is his fancy; and I judge it takes a great deal of room to draw such large lakes and rivers on. However, she has determined of her own accord to take Peggy, and I always find your real noble-minded people can contrive a way to do every kind action that turns up in their path. “Mrs. Campbell had not heard a word of the death of Captain Fitzgerald and his wife, till I told her about it: and I declare Ellen, it was a teaching providence to me when I heard it; and I could not but think of the time when I saw them at Lebanon, so young, so blooming, and so handsome, stepping over the earth with a step so light and so lofty, that it seemed not to be in all their thoughts that they must ever lie down under the cold clods. “Poor young creature! I am sure, when she was flaunting away here at Eton, I never thought I should have wet my old eyes for her; but for all, I did cry like a child when sister Lenox received your father's letter, telling all about her death, and that her last words were to beg them to send her little girl to you, and ask you to make her like yourself. “The dealings of providence are sometimes mysterious; but he that runs may read this dispensation. However, Ellen, as it would not be pleasing to you to have any thing cast up against your sister, especially since she is dead and gone, I will say no more upon this head; only to observe, that if this child lives to grow up under your training, the world will see that a woman's being beautiful and rich need not hinder her from being wise and good too: and it seemeth to me, that though God respecteth not the outward show, the more beautiful the temple is, the more fitting it is for a dwelling-place of his spirit; and I think it would be a pleasing and edifying sight to see the perfection of earth, and the beauty of heaven built up and fitly framed together. “Often, when I am alone and considering, my thoughts turn upon you Ellen, and upon all that happened before your sister went off to them West Indies, which have proved her death; and thinking of you brings to mind some passages of Scripture, which have been remarkably acted upon in your life; and first, in the sixteenth chapter of Proverbs and the seventh verse, Solomon says, `when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him'—and in the New Testament scriptures it is written, `be not wearied with well doing'—overcome evil with good,' and so on Now, in my view, these texts appear as a kind of history to what passed between you and Caroline; and it is a comforting thing to see such a plain agreement between the book of experience and the book of God's word—that is to say, to see a Christian's life a scripture proof. “Caroline's behaviour at the upshot, was a satisfaction to me in many ways, and especially as it helped to build me up in the doctrine I have always maintained, namely, that there is no soil so hard bound and so barren but what, if you work upon it long enough, you make it bring forth some good thing at last; not that it will equal that soil which is warm and rich at the start, and is from the beginning diligently opened for the sun of God's grace to shine in upon it, and the dews of heaven to nourish it—a soil like—I must write it out—like your heart, Ellen. “You need not to have said so much in your letter about your gratitude for my offer of the hundred pounds, feather beds, and so forth, for I knew you did not despise it, and that it was true, as you say, that you only refused it on account of your house being entirely filled with Mrs. Harrison's furniture, and your sister's handsome presents. “Your worldly condition, Ellen, seemed to me to be conformable to Agur's prayer—`give me neither poverty nor riches'—a prayer that every one professes to approve, but I am sorry to say, I have observed but few whose conduct bears out the profession. “Before I finish my long preachment, I wish to send my compliments to Mrs. Harrison, who I hear looks ten years younger since she went to live with you; and my duty to Mr. Redwood, who, I hope, now he is so happy, won't take Mrs. Fitzgerald's death very deeply to heart, since we must all have criss-cross lines in this life. “In conclusion, my dear Ellen, I have only to say, that as your light has shone brightly in adversity I pray it may shine on in prosperity, making glad many hearts long and long after death hath closed the eyes of “Your old friend, DEBORAH LENOX.” END.

However, Ellen, as it would not be pleasing to you to have any thing cast up against your sister, especially since she is dead and gone, I will say no more upon this head; only to observe, that if this child lives to grow up under your training, the world will see that a woman's being beautiful and rich need not hinder her from being wise and good too: and it seemeth to me, that though God respecteth not the outward show, the more beautiful the temple is, the more fitting it is for a dwelling-place of his spirit; and I think it would be a pleasing and edifying sight to see the perfection of earth, and the beauty of heaven built up and fitly framed together. “Often, when I am alone and considering, my thoughts turn upon you Ellen, and upon all that happened before your sister went off to them West Indies, which have proved her death; and thinking of you brings to mind some passages of Scripture, which have been remarkably acted upon in your life; and first, in the sixteenth chapter of Proverbs and the seventh verse, Solomon says, `when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him'—and in the New Testament scriptures it is written, `be not wearied with well doing'—overcome evil with good,' and so on Now, in my view, these texts appear as a kind of history to what passed between you and Caroline; and it is a comforting thing to see such a plain agreement between the book of experience and the book of God's word—that is to say, to see a Christian's life a scripture proof. “Caroline's behaviour at the upshot, was a satisfaction to me in many ways, and especially as it helped to build me up in the doctrine I have always maintained, namely, that there is no soil so hard bound and so barren but what, if you work upon it long enough, you make it bring forth some good thing at last; not that it will equal that soil which is warm and rich at the start, and is from the beginning diligently opened for the sun of God's grace to shine in upon it, and the dews of heaven to nourish it—a soil like—I must write it out—like your heart, Ellen. “You need not to have said so much in your letter about your gratitude for my offer of the hundred pounds, feather beds, and so forth, for I knew you did not despise it, and that it was true, as you say, that you only refused it on account of your house being entirely filled with Mrs. Harrison's furniture, and your sister's handsome presents. “Your worldly condition, Ellen, seemed to me to be conformable to Agur's prayer—`give me neither poverty nor riches'—a prayer that every one professes to approve, but I am sorry to say, I have observed but few whose conduct bears out the profession. “Before I finish my long preachment, I wish to send my compliments to Mrs. Harrison, who I hear looks ten years younger since she went to live with you; and my duty to Mr. Redwood, who, I hope, now he is so happy, won't take Mrs. Fitzgerald's death very deeply to heart, since we must all have criss-cross lines in this life. “In conclusion, my dear Ellen, I have only to say, that as your light has shone brightly in adversity I pray it may shine on in prosperity, making glad many hearts long and long after death hath closed the eyes of “Your old friend, DEBORAH LENOX.”</field>
