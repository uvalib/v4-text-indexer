      <field name="fulltext">Entered according to act of congress, in the year 1839, BY E. P. WALTTON &amp; SONS. in the clerk's office of the district court of the United States in and for the district of Vermont.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. “They come, impatient for the fight,— Burning to rush into the slaughter,— Ready to pour their blood like water For what they deem the right;— Like men, preferring glorious graves To life, if it must be the life of slaves!” It seems to be universally conceded that the first settlers of Vermont were men of an iron mould, and of an indomitable spirit. And it is no less true, we apprehend, that with corporeal frames, unusually large and muscular, and constitutions peculiarly robust and enduring, they possessed, also, intelligence and mental energies, which, considering what might naturally be expected of men of their condition in life, and in their situation in a wilderness affording none of the ordinary means of intellectual culture, were equally remarkable. The proof of these assertions is to be abundantly found, we think, in the unequalled stand taken by them for their rights, in their memorable controversy with New York, and in the multiplied documents that grew out of it, in the shape of resolves and decrees of conventions, addresses to the people, memorials and remonstrances to the governor of that province, and to the British throne itself, all drawn up with great clearness and cogency of reasoning, and evincing a knowledge of natural and constitutional rights in a people, among whom law as a profession was then entirely unknown, which are generally to be found only in the courts and councils of old and highly civilized countries. And even were these testimonials to their character wholly wanting, ample evidence, that they were a generation of no ordinary men, may still be seen in the scattered remnant of this noble band of heroes yet lingering among us, like the few and aged pines on their evergreen mountains, and, though now bowed down by the weight of nearly a century of years, exhibiting frames, which would almost seem to indicate them as men belonging to another race, and which are still animated by the light of wisdom and intelligence, and warmed by the unconquerable spirit of freedom yet burning unwasted within them. Those who have treated on this subject, when alluding to the facts we have stated, have generally coupled them with observations upon the invigorating effects of mountain air, &amp;c., leaving us to infer that these peculiarities of the early settlers were attributable only to such causes. It is, indeed, doubtless the case, that the wild scenery, and the pure elastic air of mountainous countries, are the most favorable, under the same degree of culture, to the formation of the highest grade of physical, as well as moral and intellectual character—imparting, in the one instance, that health and peculiar vigor which brings the human system to all the perfection that it is capable of attaining, and, in the other, engendering, with firmness of nerves, and firmness of purpose, the usual attendants of great bodily powers, 2 a healthy and high-toned imagination, and the lofty aspirations that exalt the character, and prompt to great and noble actions. But whatever influence the peculiar climate and scenery of this Switzerland of America, as Vermont may, perhaps, be appropriately termed, may have had, in this respect, on the descendants of these hardy settlers, little of this influence, probably, would have been perceptible to the settlers themselves: they, it must be recollected, were not natives of these mountains, but recent immigrants from other New England colonies. And whatever peculiarities they possessed must mainly be originated in other causes—from the very nature of the enterprise, probably, which brought them together, that of settling a wild and rough frontier country, known to be attended by a thousand difficulties and hardships, and beset by a thousand dangers, in which men of ordinary stamina would not think of engaging. They, indeed, may be looked upon in the light of picked men, or more properly perhaps, in that of volunteers, stepping boldly and confidently forth for some extraordinary enterprise of which the hazard and difficulty are so great, that nothing but an uncommon union of courage and strength ean accomplish it, and of which the success, or even the attempt, it may be, furnishes the best evidence of these qualities in those who voluntarily enlist in the undertaking. And as regards intelligence and mental character of these settlers, their educations were generally equal to those usually received among the better classes of the old settlements where they were obtained, and superior probably, to what the same men were able to furnish to their immediate descendants. And this fact, together with the emergencies, which not only called all the energies of their minds into action, but constantly improved them, and enlarged their information by the investigations they were induced to make for the successful prosecution of their cause in the New York controversy, will sufficiently account for their intellectual superiority over the ordinary settlers of other new countries. With these observations, here thrown in by way of showing our warrant for many of the descriptions of character which we have introduced, and which, we thought it not impossible, might otherwise subject us to the charge of indulging in improbabilities, we will now proceed with the incidents of our story. The morning of the ninth of May broke brightly upon the encampment of our troops at Castleton, disclosing to the view, now for the first time, an organized band of about three hundred as brave and hardy men as ever assembled for deeds of daring and danger. Of this number more than three fourths were Green Mountain Boys. The remainder were men collected from the nearest parts of Massachusetts and Connecticut, and led on by several enterprising militia officers of those colonies, who had actively co-operated in getting up the expedition. A council had been held the night previous, for the purpose of organizing these united forces, which had been dropping in irregularly through the day and a greater part of the night, and also for making all other necessary arrangements to march for their destination on the following morning. At this council Ethan Allen had been unanimously appointed the commander in chief of the expedition. Colonel Easton, one of the Massachusetts officers, was placed second in command. And the third grade was assigned to Warrington; while Selden, in making the subordinate appointments, was raised to the post of captain to supply the place left vacant by the promotion of his superior. Even our friend, Pete Jones, though now absent, was not forgotten in the distribution of honors, but named to take charge of the scouts, provided he joined the expedition. All these arrangements having been made the night before, as just stated, the troops by sunrise had breakfasted, and were now under arms, and undergoing a review preparatory to marching. All were in high spirits, and animated at the thought of being immediately led to the important object of their enterprise. Their gallant leader, now dressed and equipped in a manner appropriate to his rank, and mounted on his own noble charger, was riding proudly along their imposing front—now pausing to give some directions to an officer, now to inspect the equipments of a company, and now backing his curvetting steed to take a view of the whole; while his towering form seemed to dilate, and rise still higher to the view, his bosom heave with pride, and his eyes glisten with delight, as they ran along the lines of his stout and broad-chested Green Mountain Boys, and read in their hardy features, lit up with enthusiasm, and eagerness for action in a cause which every man had made his own, the same high resolves, the same burning desires to signalize themselves that animated his own bosom. At this moment a stranger, who, with a single attendant in the capacity of a servant, had but a short time before arrived, came on to the ground, and took a conspicuous stand in front of the troops. He was of about the middle age, stout, well made, and handsomely featured, while a Roman nose, a thin curling lip, and a black flashing eye, with the peculiarly contemptuous, and even sinister expression, and reckless air, which they combined to give his countenance, denoted no ordinary degree of self esteem, and a fiery and impetuous disposition. He was richly and fashionably dressed, and wore a sword, epaulett, and other insignia usually worn by field officers of the times. `Captain Blagden,' said Selden, turning to a Connecticut officer near him, and pointing to the stranger just described, `can you inform me who that proud and scornful looking fellow yonder may be? He belongs not to us of the Green Mountains; nor does he appear to have any connection with the troops from Massachusetts, or with those from your own colony; and yet his demeanor, and showy military appendages, would lead one to suppose that he came here to take command of the whole of us.' `I have been looking at the man myself,' replied the person addressed, `and, though not quite certain, yet I believe I know him. I think he must be one whom I well knew when we were boys, and of whose singular career I have since been often informed. And, if my conjectures are right, his name is Arnold, Benedict Arnold of New Haven.' `But what do you imagine has brought him here, with these apparent assumptions?' `Well, now I bethink me, sir, I remember, that the day I left home, a townsman of mine, who had just returned from New Haven, reported that, when the news of the battle of Lexington arrived at that place, Captain Arnold, who is the commander of an independent company there, started, with several other military men, post haste for the scene of action. And as he is said to be a good officer, having been a soldier in the army (into which he run 2* away and enlisted in his youth,) I should not be surprised to learn he had received a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. And further, as he was stationed, while a boy-soldier, at Ticonderoga, and knows, doubtless, considerable of its situation, I will hazard a bottle with you, Captain Selden, that he has craved, and obtained, permission of that committee, to take charge of the troops which they probably heard were collecting for this expedition.' `Aha? Colonel Allen, I imagine, will have a word to say to that bargain. It would fairly break his heart to be deprived of the chance of receiving the first charge of grape or canister that shall salute us from the wide-mouthed war-dogs of Old Ti. And if your surmises are correct, a collision, I fear, is unavoidable, unless Mr. Arnold should, as I think he certainly ought, waive his pretensions to the command.' `A collision it will be then: for Arnold, it is said, was never yet known to yield to any thing, when his purposes were fixed. A more reckless dare-devil, I suppose, never trod the foot-stool. Why, sir, when we were but boys, I have known him spring upon a large water-wheel in full motion, grasp one of its arms, with his head towards the circumference, and there remain till he had been dashed through the back-water beneath, during forty revolutions! I have known him, single handed, seize and overcome a mad ox, which had broke away from, and nearly killed a dozen men. One or more duels he has fought abroad; while scores of bullies have been cudgeled and conquered by him, about home. Indeed, if one half that is told of him is true, the wild bulls of Bashan had not a spirit more untameable, nor scarcely more bodily strength to back it.' `All that may be, sir, but those who know Ethan Allen will laugh at the very idea of there being found a man in New England who can outdo him in feats of either strength or courage. And when they tell you, as they truly may, that they have seen him bite off the heads of board nails by dozens,— seize by his teeth, and throw over his head, bags containing each a bushel of salt, as fast as two men could bring them round to him,—grasp two opponents who had beset him, one in each hand, and lifting them clear of the ground, hold them out at arms length, and beat them together till they cried for mercy,—engage alone with a York Sheriff and his posse of six common men, rout the whole, and leave them sprawling on the ground—you will probably allow, that such a man will not be very likely to succumb to your hero. Let this Arnold but offer to assume the command, and, unless I am sadly mistaken, you will see what kind of stuff our old Green Mountain lion is made off. But see! the fellow is beckoning the officers to approach him. Let us move up to the spot, and hear what he has to offer on the occasion.' Understanding and heeding the intimation of the stranger officer, who was indeed no other than Benedict Arnold, afterwards so infamously conspicuous in the annals of our revolution, most of the officers, including Allen, who had dismounted for the purpose, immediately advanced, and formed an irregular line before him. `Gentlemen,' said he, with a perfectly assured and confident air, after waiting till all had approached and assumed a listening attitude, `I am personally unknown, I presume, to most, or all of you, but having been clothed with the proper authority, and directed to proceed to this place for the purpose, I have the honor to announce myself to you as the commander of this expedition,—consequently it is now my duty to take charge of these troops.' `Sir?' said Allen, taking a step in advance of his fellow officers, placing his arms akimbo, and turning up his ear, as if the better to catch the words of the speaker, whom he eyed askance with a look of queerly blended doubt and scorn: `Sir? Did I hear aright? Did you say that you thought it your duty to take charge of these troops?' `I did, sir, and still so consider it,' replied Arnold, rather restively. `Do you, indeed, sir,' rejoined Allen, with a look of cool derision. `Then it was altogether a mistake of mine in supposing that the reverse of your proposition would have made out a more probable case?' `I know not what you mean,' said Arnold, his voice trembling with stifled anger at the biting significance of the other's remark. `You may learn, however, that I am not a person to be trifled with, sir.' `Well, I can't pretend to say what, or who, you are not,' replied Allen, waxing warm, and giving token of a direct onset, `but I should like to know who the devil you are, that come here from another colony to take the control of men who now own allegiance to no power short of that of the God of Heaven?' `My name is Arnold,' replied the other, biting his lips in suppressed rage, `and I hold a commission of Colonel, with the orders I named, from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. There! examine it for yourselves!' he added, pulling out a parchment, and disdainfully hurling it at their feet. The roll was instantly picked up, and attentively examined by several of the officers; while Arnold stood aloof in contemptuous silence, scarcely deigning to bestow a glance on the company thus engaged. It indeeed proved, as he had stated, a colonel's commission, from the source above mentioned, enclosing another document, signed by the same committee, authorizing Arnold to raise troops in Massachusetts, or elsewhere, to the number of four hundred, and march them for the reduction of Ticonderoga. `Now, sir, where is your commission? I should like to see it in turn,' said Arnold, addressing Allen, and advancing with an air of triumph, as soon as the examination of his credentials, which he supposed must silence all further question of the right he had assumed, was completed. `My commission?' promptly replied Allen, by no means disturbed by this unexpected demand, though in fact he had no paper commission to show, as the council appointing him had not deemed such an instrument essential: `where is my commission, do you ask? There, sir!' he continued, pointing to his troops, who, understanding Arnold's claim to take command of them, already began to exhibit visible tokens of displeasure at the thought of having their idolized leader superceded by a stranger, `there, sir! there it is, engraven on the hearts of these two hundred and thirty Green Mountain Boys! Trace it out there for yourself! Read it in their eyes, in every lineament of their countenances! and if that is not enough for you, then ask them whether Ethan Allen, who is getting gray in their service, is to be thrust aside for a commander whom they have never before seen?' `Never! no, never!' fiercely burst from a hundred lips along the the lines, while many indignantly threw down their arms, and all, either by word, look or gesture, gave unequivocal indication of their determination to allow no man to usurp the place of their chosen leader. The countenance of Arnold, with all his assurance, instantly fell at so decided, and to him, so unexpected a manifestation of the disposition of the troops; and he bit his lips in vexation and mortified pride at his defeat. At this crisis of the affair, Warrington, fearing, in common with the other officers, that the altercation might prove ruinous to the enterprise, stepped forward and interposed. He first, respectfully, and in a manner calculated to soothe the irritated feelings of Arnold, set forth the doubtfulness of his right, even under the instructions and commission he had received, to assume the command of troops who had not been enlisted by him, but who had volunteered, without any knowledge of him or his instructions, and with the implied condition that they should be left to the choice of their own leaders. He then appealed to him as a gentleman, a patriot, and friend to the common cause, whether he would do well to insist on his claim, since doing so, as he must see, would prove destructive of their expedition. This courteous and well-timed appeal, which opened a door by which Arnold might honorably retreat from his awkward position, seemed to produce on his mind an instantaneous effect. The dark and angry frown, which had settled on his countenance, gave way to a bright and cheerful look. With one hand he instantly tore the epauletts from his shoulders, while with the other he drew his sword and threw it on the ground, gallantly exclaiming, `Gentlemen, I most cheerfully waive all pretensions to the command, which of right, I am now convinced, belongs to the brave leader of the far-famed Green Mountain Boys. But as to going with you on this glorious enterprise, it is a privilege which, by — I wont relinquish! Gentlemen, will you furnish me with a common musket, and accept me as a volunteer soldier of your gallant band?' Allen appeared to be taken completely aback by this sudden declaration of Arnold. His naturally forgiving and noble disposition, and quick feelings, were instantly touched with this mark of magnanimity, as unexpected to him, as it was remarkable in the man, being the most striking, and perhaps the only instance of the kind, ever displayed by this brave, but unprincipled officer in his whole public career. `Done like a man, by Jove!' exclaimed the chivalrous leader of the Green Mountain Boys, advancing and cordially proffering the other his hand, while the tears of admiring and grateful emotion fairly started out on to his brawny cheeks. `Done like a man and a hero! Here, God bless you, give us your fist! There is about the right kind of stuff in you after all, my friend. Will you accept the post of my aidecamp, with the rank your commission gives you?' `Most cheerfully, sir,' replied the flattered Arnold, waving his hand with easy and grateful courtesy. `Pick up your sword and badges, then, sir,' resumed Allen. `Call for your horse, and we will now on together, like brothers, in the cause of God and the people. Officers and soldiers!' he continued, in a loud and cheering voice, that rung like a deeptoned trumpet far and wide over field and forest around, while he sprang upon his impatient charger, and waved his sword on high; `prepare to march! Ethan Allen still commands you. Peace is in the camp, the Lord on our side, and victory before us! Forward march!' Three loud and lively cheers told the satisfaction of the men at this double announcement; and, in another moment, the whole corps, wheeling off to the brisk and stirring notes of shrieking fife and rattling drum, were sweeping down the road in full march towards the object of their destination. The rout of the troops was along the old military road, which, in the French war of 1759, had been opened from Charleston on Connecticut river across the Green Mountains to lake Champlain, by a New Hampshire regiment, acting under the orders of General Amherst. This road, leading directly through Castleton, and taking a northerly direction, branched off within a few miles of the lake, one fork running down to the shore opposite to Ticonderoga, and the other proceeding onward to Crown Point. Although this, at the period, was perhaps the best road in the settlement, still it was little more than a roughly cut path through the wilderness, abounding, at this season, with deep sloughs, fallen trees and other obstacles calculated to prevent much expedition in travelling. But such was the spirit and constitutional vigor of the men, that a march of four or five hours brought them over half the distance from their late rendezvous to their destined landing on the lake, the former place being about thirty miles from the latter. They had now, for several miles, been passing through a heavy unbroken forest, and the mounted officers, riding a short distance in advance of the men, were anxiously looking forward for a clearing, or some suitable place to halt for a mid-day refreshment. `There!' said Allen, turning to his companions, as the sound of a falling tree came booming through the forest from a distance, `did you hear that? We are nearly through these endless woods at last, it seems.' `Is that so clearly proved by the falling of a tree?' asked Arnold, who was but little of a woodsman. `Old trees, I thought, like old men, often fell without human agency.' `True sir,' rejoined Allen, `but human agency brought that tree to the ground; and it stood beside some opening, too, or I will agree to be reckoned, like the prophets of old, without honor in my own country.' `Colonel Allen is right,' observed Warrington: `The falling of a green tree always produces a dull, heavy, lumbering sound, such as we just heard, occasioned by the air it gathers, or more properly, perhaps, disturbs in its course; while the sound of a dry tree in falling is sharper, and comes with a single jar to the ear. That this tree stood near an opening, is sufficiently evident from the echoes that followed the first sound, which, in this flat land, could only be produced by the reverberating woods-wall of an opening. Yes, the Colonel is correct: I can now hear the chopper's blows quite distinctly.' The falling of another tree in the same direction here interrupted the conversation; while the axe-man's blows, sounding, in the distance, and in the tranquil medium through which they were conveyed 3 to the ear, like the ticking of a clock in the stillness of night, could now plainly be heard by all. In two or three moments a third tree came thundering to the earth. Another, and yet another followed at equally brief intervals,—the noise attending each successive fall, as well as that of the fast repeating blows of the chopper, who was causing such destruction among the sturdy tenants of the forest, all growing more loud and distinct as the party approached. `There must be more than one of them,' observed Colonel Easton, `to level so large trees at that rapid rate.' `No, sir,' replied Warrington; `the regular, and non-interfering sounds of those blows indicate but one axe-man. You have not witnessed so much of the execution of which our Green Mountain Boys are capable, as I trust you will within twenty-four hours, Colonel. At all events, the fate of a tree, under the sinewy arms of one of them, is very soon decided.' `This fellow, however,' remarked Allen, `does, indeed, lay to it, with a will. I think he must make a good soldier; and as such, he shall go with us, if of the right way of thinking—if not, as a prisoner: for it behoves us now, to know pretty well the character of every man who is permitted to remain behind.' The party now soon came in sight of the man who had been the subject of their conversation. He had made an opening in the forest of about two acres, which he was rapidly enlarging. Having just leveled one large tree, he was now bending his tall frame in an attack upon another, a giant hemlock, standing near the road, and had struck two or three blows, sending the blade of his axe into the huge circumference up to the helve at every stroke; when the tramp of the approaching party reached his ear, causing him to suspend and look around him. `As I live, it is Pete Jones!' exclaimed Warrington, `just begining upon his new pitch, which he mentioned to us.' `Good!' said Allen, `I am glad we have come across the droll devil. But we will furnish him with business a notch or two above that: the Red Coats need leveling a cursed sight more than the trees, at this crisis. If nothing more, he shall lend us that everlasting long body of his for a ladder to scale the walls of Old Ti! Jupiter! if Frederick of Prussia had a regiment of such chaps, how the fellow would brag! Hallo, there!' he added, dashing forward towards the woodsman, who stood gazing with an expression of quizzical wonder, now at the approaching cavalcade of officers near by, and now straining forward his long neck to get a view of the lengthened columns of the men, just beginning to make their appearance in the distance. `Well, hallo it is, then, Colonel, if there's nothing better to be said,' responded Jones, after waiting an instant to see if the other was going to proceed. `But now I think on't, Colonel, where did you get so much folks? By Jehu! how they string along yonder! Why, there's more than a hundred slew of men coming! And then what pokerish looking tools they've all got! Now I wonder if they an't a going a visiting over to Old Ti, or somewheres?' `I should not be surprised if something of that kind should prove the case,' replied Allen, laughing. `But what are you about, that you have not joined as in the proposed visit?' `Why, I calculate to be about this old hemlock till I get it down, Colonel.' `Nonsense, you ninny! Why were you not up to Castleton last night?' `Now, don't fret, Colonel,—I did think of it, honestly; but knowing you must all come this way, I thought I might as well be making a small beginning here till you got on. And so I put in yesterday a little, and have now let in heaven's light on something over two acres, I calculate. But if you are expecting to have pretty funny times of it over there, I don't much care if I—that is, I'll think of it, after I have brought the top of this old hemlock a little lower'— `Your most obedient, Captain Jones,' gaily exclaimed Warrington, now riding up. `Captain of what?' asked Jones, a little puzzled to know whether he was to receive this address as a joke, and let off one of his own in return, or whether something seriouswas intended by it: `Captain of what?—of the Surveyor, that I sent over the York line, a day or two ago, by a gentle touch with my foot on his northerly parts?' `No, seriously Jones,' said Allen, `in organizing, last night, we deemed it best to have a small band of scouts, of whom you was fairly voted in the Captain, or Scout-master, if you like the name better. No man in the settlement can go before you in performing the duties of this post. Will you, without more words, accept it, and join us?' `Can't you let me stop to cut this tree down first? 'Twon't take scarce a minute, Colonel.' `No, the men are at hand. We did think to find a spot to halt and dine here, but as I see neither place nor water, we must on till we find them. How soon shall we meet with such a place?' `Let me see, as the blind man said—Oh! there is a cute little beauty of a brook, with smooth banks, that's jest your sorts, not half a mile ahead.' `Fall in here with the troops then. But where is your rifle?' `Hard by there, under a log,' replied Pete. `I'll warrant, you never catch me far seperated from old Trusty, with a good store of bullets to go on such errands, as she and I have a mind to send them. Well, old axe,' he added, in an under tone, as he took up the implement to which he seemed to be addressing himself, and carried it round to the back side of the tree, `the Colonel thinks it best, that you and I should bid each other good-bye, for a short time; and there! you may sit in that nook between those two roots till I come back again.' “So now to the wars I go, I go, All for to go a sodgering. Trol, lol, lol de larly.” And thus, in the prompt spirit of the times, and with the characteristic sang froid of the man, this jolly and fearless woodsman, drawing out his rifle from under an old log, and cheerily troulling the above quoted catch of some homely old song, with a chorus of his own making, fell into the ranks of the troops then passing, having left his favorite axe, for which he seemed to have contracted a sort of fellow-feeling, standing behind the tree, on which we found him engaged, where it was destined to remain unregarded by its owner, during a great part of the revolutionary war;—and where, on returning, after many years of hardship and danger, spent in 3* bravely battling for his country's freedom, he found it, in the same place and position, safe and uninjured, except in the thick coat of rust that had gathered over it—an incident of olden times, well known as a historical fact by many in that section of the country where it occurred. The spot described by Jones being found and appropriated, the troops partook of a dinner from the provisions of their packs, after which they were allowed an hour's rest, which was enlivened, as they were seated along the mossy banks of the gurgling rivulet, with song, tale and jest, till the deep recesses of the forest rang with the sounds of their merriment. While the officers, who were seated in a group by themselves, were consulting their watches, and awaiting the moment set by them for resuming their march, a horseman, approaching from the west, suddenly rode up, dismounted, and stood before them. `Ah! Phelps!' exclaimed Colonel Allen, springing up and shaking the new comer heartily by the hand, `is it possible?—a spy returned unhung from a British fort? Well, sir, what news from the camp of the Philistines?' `Almost every thing we could wish, gentlemen,' replied the person addressed, a Connecticut gentleman of considerable shrewdness and address, who had been dispatched a day or two previous to go over to the fort, enter it on some feigned errand, and gain the best knowledge of its situation the circumstances would permit. `I have been within the fort —mostly over the works—staid there last night, and came away ususpected this morning.' Phelps then proceeded to give an account of the manner he had effected his discoveries at the fort, without exciting the suspicions of the garrison, relative to the object of his visit—how, in the assumed character of a green country bumpkin, he made it his ostensible errand to see a war-cannon, and also the strange man what shaved other men, called a barber—how the soldiers laughed at his pretended ignorance, and the officers coming to see the green Yankee, amused themselves by questioning him, and listening to his replies, at which they were amazingly tickled, and then ordered a twenty-four pounder to be fired, for the fun of witnessing the prodigious fright, into which the report appeared to throw him. And finally, having induced him, after many intreaties, to permit the barber to shave him, how they all stood by to see the performance, laughing heartily at the wincing and woful countenance he assumed, and the fears he pretended of having his throat cut. After finishing his diverting description of this part of his adventures, he detailed with great accuracy, the situation of the fortress, the names and grades of the officers, and the number of the garrison. `But, gentlemen,' said he, in conclusion, `there is one question, which I will no longer delay to ask you. Have you made provision for boats to transport the troops across the lake? There is not a single craft larger than a skiff on this side, just now, within ten miles of the fort.' `God forgive me the oversight!' exclaimed Allen. `We must instantly set measures on foot for repairing it. Douglass, Lieutenant Douglass, step forward here a moment! What boats are there this side the take to the north of this?' `An excellent scow for our purpose is owned by the Smiths, a few miles this side of Crown Point,' replied the blue eyed and broad shouldered descendant of his Caledonian namesakes, stepping promptly forward, and comprehending at a glance the emergency that produced the question. `The Smiths? Good! They are with us, too, in heart, and should be also in person,' rejoined the Colonel. `Well, their scow we must have, at all events. And you, Douglass, are the very man to go and get it. Will you do it?' `I am the very man who is willing to try, Colonel Allen,' answered the other. `And can you reach the landing against Ti with it by nine o'clock this evening?' `Hardly, I fear. It is nearly a dozen miles; but I'll do my best, Colonel.' `Go, then, as if the devil kicked you an end. The salvation of our project may depend upon your getting back in season. But stay! we must have more boats than one. To the South, I know of none. Perhaps you may meet with some going up or down the lake, which might be pressed into the service; or, as the last resort, one might possibly be got away from Crown Point, without a discovery which would endanger us. Another man, however, will be wanted for any of these purposes, besides the oarsmen you will pick up on your way. And—Jones! this way! Have you heard what we are at? Very well. You are just the chap to go on this haphazard errand. What say you?—Can you bring any thing to pass, if we send you?' `Why, I can't exactly say, Colonel,' replied Jones, placing his feet astride, and looking up with one eye queerly cocked on his interrogator, while the other was tightly closed: `I an't so much of a water fowl as some; but, perhaps, I mought make fetch come a little.' `Pack up, then, and be off with Douglass in two minutes; and remember, both of you, if you fail us'— `Then what?' asked Jones, suddenly stopping and looking back, `I don't calculate to be over particular, Colonel, but if it wouldn't be too much trouble, I should like to know that, before we start.' `You shall be doomed to sit forty days and nights in sackcloth and ashes,' humorously said Allen. `By Jonah!' exclaimed Pete, `the boats shall be there by the time, Colonel!' While the latter part of this dialogue was going on, Warrington stood with his back to the company, with one foot on a log, busily engaged in writing with his pencil on a blank leaf, torn from his pocket book and placed on his knee. `Aha? my lad,' said Allen, in a playful undertone as he approached the former, and significantly placed one finger on his shoulder, `more faith now, than when we two were lying on the hay in the Captain's barn, waiting for our rifles, eh?' `I really wish you would mind your own business, Colonel,' replied Warrington, with affected anger. `Well, well,' resumed Allen, laughing, `send it, my boy. Mars, they say, never prospers so well as when he has Cupid in his train, in any case. But with such a piece of God's handy work, as yours, to incite to action—heavens! if the knights of old had been blest with such lady-loves, they would never have needed to carry a half a hundred weight of old iron on their lubberly carcasses to make them heroes?' Stripping off their coats to fit them for a rapid march, these athletic and resolute woodsmen now seized their rifles, took a glance at the sun for a hasty calculation of the bearing of the course to be taken to lead them to their proposed destination, and, plunging into the woods, were soon lost to the sight of their companions. A small guard was then sent on in advance, with orders to pick up and detain every man on the road, not in the secret of the expedition. Scouts, to range the woods on the right and left, were also dispatched for the same purpose; after which the main body of the forces quietly resumed their march for the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “There are strange movements among all the troops, And no one knows the cause.” Leaving Allen and his companions in arms to make their way to the lake shore, we will now, by way of marking the progress of the two active foresters, who had been dispatched northward for boats, change the scene, for a short time, to the quiet residence of Captain Hendee. It was a little past sunset on the evening of the day, on which the events last described transpired. It had been a day of unusual stillness in the northern part of the Grants. The lively sounds of the plying axe men, which were usually heard ringing through the forest in every direction, were all hushed. The women went a visiting, and were seen to whisper in the corners apart from the children. The boys finished their tasks by noon, and for the remainder of the day were sauntering round the brooks with their fish-poles. All the active men had disappeared; though no one mentioned aloud the cause of their absence. And a sort of Sabbath day quiet and inaction seemed to prevail over all this section of the settlement. Captain Hendee was sitting in his open door, enjoying, as usual, his evening pipe, and wrapped in that placid and contemplative mood to which this indulgence generally disposes. His daughter was seated near him at a window, in an attitude equally calm and contemplative, though engrossed with reflections, probably, of a far different nature: for her fair white hand rested on a small volume lying on the window sill before her, opened upon those heart melting strains of the hapless Eloise, which Pope, that master of rhyme and marrer of reason, sung with such seductive sweetness; and her tear-moistened eye was fixed pensively and unobservant, on the slumbering waters of the outspread lake; while occasionally a gentle sigh, betokening the inward conflicts of hope and fear, was heaving her snowy bosom. While the father and daughter were thus seated, and their minds thus absorbed in their different trains of reflection, their attention was suddenly arrested by the sounds of advancing footsteps. `By all the saints in the calandar!' exclaimed the Captain, after gazing an instant in surprise at the striking proportions of our young Anak of the woods, for it was no other than Pete Jones, who, at the distance of eight or ten rods, was now seen stalking towards the house; `what a cloud brusher is there, Alma! Can you imagine who he may be?' `No, father,' replied Alma, who was also looking at the approaching visitor with an expression of mingled wonder and curiosity; `but I just noticed that Young Tyler and Wilcox of this neighborhood passed behind the barn yonder, and I conclude that this man is some friend of theirs. They are probably all going on some fishing excursion. The man, I presume, wishes to get a little fire for this purpose.' By this time Jones had reached the door in which the Captain was sitting. `Good evening! Will you walk in, sir?' said the latter in an indifferent tone, and without moving, as if he expected the other would decline the invitation, and announce his errand at his door. `Why, yes, I may as well, perhaps,' replied Jones, offering to pass in without appearing to notice the hesitating and enquiring look of the Captain, who now at once yielded the space to his guest. `You see I was bred to manners,' continued the woodsman, jocosely bowing, so as to enable him to enter the door. The Captain, smiling good naturedly at the remark, handed Jones a chair, took another himself, and waited in silence, and with the same expecting air as before, for the stranger to name his business, This, however, Jones did not seem ready to make known, but continued sitting in silence, with a puzzled and undecided air, as if greatly at loss what to say, or how to bring about some object he had in view, now glancing at the Captain, now at the different objects about the room, and now at Miss Hendee, on whom his eyes lingered with an expression of unfeigned admiration. `Very fine weather, this,' remarked the Captain, by way of breaking the silence, which he seemed to think was becoming a little awkward. `Very; considering the times, and the state of the nation,' responded Pete, dryly, and with the manner of one who would show that he is too busy in thought to engage in conversation. The Captain then made some other common-place observation, which met with no reply of any kind; when finding himself thus defeated in every attempt to draw the other into conversation, and tired of waiting for him to name his errand, he withdrew his attention, and sunk into his own reveries. After Jones had set awhile longer chewing his cud of perplexity, a change appeared suddenly to come over him. A flash of intelligence and decision lit upon his countenance. And, after dropping his head an instant, as if settling the details of a plan which he appeared to have hit upon, he slowly drew up his features into a sober and troubled air, and began to catch his breath, and shiver all over, like a man taken with an ague fit. He then rose, tottled across the floor to the hearth, raked open the fire and spread his shaking hands over the coals, at the same time attempting to speak, as he observed the eyes of the Captain and his daughter were turned upon him with a look of lively concern. `O, nev—never mind!'—he said, articulating with great apparent difficulty, in his attempt to quiet their alarm,—` 'twill s—s—soon be o—o—over now— though the—the—these swamp ag—ag—agues are bad while they last. You, you don't—keep—keep great fires—here—I—I—I see.' `We will have one in a moment, my friend,' said the Captain, leaping up at this hint, and hobbling out of doors after wood, with unwonted activity. 4 No sooner was the old gentleman fairly out of sight than Jones' malady entirely disappeared. He quickly drew out a billet, and turning, tossed it into the lap of the astonished Miss Hendee. `Here, mum,' said he, in a low, confidential tone, `there's no time to be polite; but read that, and if you want to scrabble off two lines, or so, in answer, contrive to get it into my old hat there on the table, in almost no time, as I'm in a taking of a hurry. But stay, where's the Indian?' `He has gone to take a letter for me to Major Skene's colored man, now lying with his boat down here at the landing, I believe,' replied the blushing girl, already on her way to her apartment to read and answer the billet, which a glance at the hand writing told her was from her accepted lover. `That's lucky,' said Jones; `now I want that chap to go with us. We have got a trifling chore to do to-night somewhere in the neighborhood of Old Ti. Had I better speak to the old gentleman about his going, or not?' `My father should be consulted, and yet'—answered Alma, hesitating, lest the suggested application to Captain Hendee might in some way lead to a discovery of her own secret—`I heard him promise Neshobee's services to Colonel Allen, for such an emergency. Perhaps you had better consult no one but Neshobee himself, and if he is willing to go, I will stand his friend in defending the delinquency, if such it be.' Captain Hendee now returned with the wood, and found Pete's ague much as he left it. But as the fire blazed up from the light combustibles which had been thrown on to it, the attack seemed gradually to subside. Meanwhile, Alma had retired, read the brief out-pouring of her lover's heart, and penned in answer— “From my heart I thank you for your kind note. All as yet remains undiscovered,—painful, painful exigency! which compels concealment of so important a step from an only parent! And yet I regret not my troth; and whatever of sorrow it may cost me, I will not repine at the fruit of a tree of my own planting. Heaven preserve you, my very dear friend, in the hour of peril, and crown with success your efforts in the cause of freedom. Yours, but too truly, A. H.” By the time Alma had completed her note, and managed, on her return to the room, to slip it, unobserved, into the designated place of deposit, Jones had so far recovered from his pretended indisposition, that he announced himself in a condition for proceeding on his way. And taking a coal of fire between a couple of chips, by way of accounting to the Captain for his call, and stopping a moment to listen to the sage nostrums recommended by his host to prevent the recurrence of his ague, he departed, and joined his two newly enlisted associates, who were impatiently awaiting his coming in the adjoining field. It being now sufficiently dusk to prevent all observation from the opposite garrison, they proceeded immediately to the landing, which they found guarded by two Green Mountain Boys, who, making fishing their ostensible business, had, in pursuance of the arrangement before mentioned, closely watched the place during the two preceding days. Here, also, they met Neshobee, who had just returned in a skiff, from Major Skene's scow, in possession, as before intimated, of a stout negro, who, with two low, sottish fellows under his command, having spent that day at the fort to take in some loading, and visit the soldiers previous to starting for home, as they intended to do, the next morning, had come over just at night and taken a fishing station near the landing. Jones and his companions hesitated not to open their project of obtaining this boat to Neshobee, who very cheerfully agreed to co-operate with them in duping the negro, and to assist in rowing the boat up to the landing, where they were to be met by Allen's forces. The boat was lying about a dozen rods from the shore; and black Jack, as he was called, and his men, having pulled up their anchor, were now on the point of putting back for the fort; when the party on shore, their plan of operations being all arranged, hailed the black commander, and desired him to haul up to the landing. `Who the debil you, who want me do all dat for notting?' replied Jack, in a swaggering, consequential tone. `O, pull up to the shore,' said Wilcox, `there are three or four of us here who are wishing to make a bargain with you.' `Bargain, hey? you shackaroons, you! You tink for play some deblish trick, don't you? Guess you find out you no catch weasel sleep so easy as all dat come to!' responded the negro, chuckling at his own wit and sagacity. `No, now, honestly, Captain Jack,' rejoined the first speaker, `we want to go to Shoreham landing to night, to be ready to join a wolf hunt which they are going to start there early to-morrow morning.' `Gosh all fire-lock!' exclaimed the black, whose opinion of his own importance was greatly raised by being addressed as Captain: `You tink I row my boat all de way up dare in de dark jest for commodate you? No! see you all dam fus!' `Now you are too bad, Captain; but you won't damn our jug of old Jamaica, that we intended to offer you for carrying us up there, will you?' said the other, taking a jug from under his coat and swinging it over his head, so that the black, whose taste for liquor was well known to the young men, might catch a view of it in the twilight. `What you say, dere?' eagerly said Jack, stretching forward his neck to see, and make sure of the existence of the tempting impliment. `We say,' replied the former, `that here is a gallon of as good rum as ever run down your throat, which is at your service, if you will close the bargain. Come, give us your answer, for if we can't make a trade with you, we must be off for a boat somewhere else. What say you?—and mind ye, we will lend you a stiff hand at the oars to boot.' `You help row de boat, you say?' answered Jack, in an altered and yielding tone. `Why de debil you no say so fore? Dat be a case dat alter de circumstance. You wery much to blame, gemmen, dat you no mention so portant a difference in fus place,' added the negro, while he and his men headed round the boat, and handled the oars with such effect that nearly the next moment she was lying at the landing. Within five minutes from this time, the magic jug, which had effected such a wonderful change in the aspect of affairs, having been well tested in the meanwhile by Jack and his associates, all hands were stripped and bending to the oars of the old *4 scow, which, under the forceful strokes of Jones and his party, aided by the rum-power of Jack's two besotted boatmen, was surging through the waters towards the south, as fast as their united strength would drive her. They were soon met, however, by puffs of south wind, against which they found it impossible to make but a very slow head way. And it was not till considerable past midnight that they came to the last reach, and hove in sight of the destined landing. But here, overhauling Douglas with the other scow, and the party he had enlisted to help man it, both boats with renewed efforts of rival speed, pushed forward for the appointed shore. `Boat ahoy!' called out Allen from the landing where, as the boats neared the place, his huge, tower-like form, rising in bold relief over the stationary group of officers around him, could now plainly be discerned by the approaching crews: `boat ahoy! who comes there?' `Douglas and friends, in this,' was the reply from the first boat, coming in about its length in advance of the other. `And who in the next?' asked Allen. `Jones and a thunder cloud!' responded the well known voice of the jolly woodsman. `Now you needn't think I am fibbing, Colonel; for you will see it lighten when we get ashore.' `All is well, then,' said Allen, without heeding the remarks of Jones, further than his announcement of himself with a boat: `all is well, and glory to God in the highest, that you have got here at last! I thought you would have never come. Why, it has been an age since dark! Some old sun-stopping Joshua must be fighting on the other side of the earth, or, I swear, it would have been day light long ago!' By this time the first boat had struck the shore, and the crew leaping out, were all readily recognized by the leader, who then turned to the other boat, at that instant driving up, with the astonished and frightened negro, (now for the first time mistrusting a trick,) gibbering and sputtering aloud,— `What de hell all dis?—who all dese? what pretty dam scrape you got me into here, you shackaroon debils, you?' `What in the name of all that is black and red have you got here, Jones?' cried Allen, in surprise, stepping up and peering into the boat, on hearing Jack's exclamations. `Why, just what I told you, Colonel. Here! don't you see it lighten, now?' said Pete, pointing to the negro's eyes, which, glaring wide with fear and astonishment, at what he saw and heard, glimmered like fire bugs in the dark. `But the English of it is, Colonel, that we came across Major Skene's scow, commanded by Captain Darkey, with his two oarsmen, here, who for a gallon of rum were kind enough to bring us along to join a hunting match at Shoreham, where we have now arrived, safe and sound:' he continued, turning to the black, `so now, Captain Jack, you have fulfilled your bargain with us; and we have nothing more to say, as far as we are concerned. If these rough looking chaps here want to employ you further, they will let you know it, likely.' `Jones, you deserve a pension for life!' exclaimed Allen, comprehending the whole affair in an instant. `You, and your friends here, have killed more birds with one stone than you dreamed of yourselves, perhaps. But we have not a moment to lose, so leap out my lads. And as to Major Skene's boat, it is my lawful prize; and Major Skene's negro, and Major Skene's negro's understrappers here, are all my prisoners!' `O, no, totally unpossible to stop, gemmen!' said Jack, in a good lord, good devil sort of tone, being doubtful whether they really intended to make him prisoner, or engage him and his boat to carry them to some other place: `I have provision for de Major's family, aboard. Dey all out ob supply for dere necessity. Quite unpossible, gemmen.' `We will take care of the provisions. So out with you in no time, you black Satan!' said Allen, impatiently. `O, it be out ob all question I stop!' persisted the negro with increasing alarm, `I have odder portant business—I have letter from de young leddy at Captain Hendee's to de young leddy ob Colonel Reed at de Major's dat I oblige for deliver, early in de morning.' `We will undertake the delivery of the letter,' said Selden and Warrington, simultaneously. `Tumble them out, boys!' sternly exclaimed Allen. `O, Lordy, I den be ruin! totally, foreber ruin!' groaned the distressed and frightened black, as the men seized him and his two drunken associates, and led them to the rear to be put under guard. The boats were now instantly headed round, the oars muffled, careful oarsmen selected and placed in their seats; when, after each boat had been filled with as many troops as their respective burthens would safely permit, they pushed off from the shore, preceded a short hailing distance by a skiff, occupied by Allen and Arnold, with Phelps to pilot them to their contemplated landing, on the opposite shore. The wind had some time since died wholly away; and the elements were now all hushed, as if in the slumbers of death; while the deeply freighted crafts glided slowly on, impelled by the light dip of the feathery oars, which, in the hands of the experienced and careful men who plied them, unitedly rose and fell as noiseless as the feet of fairies on beds of flowers. At length the dark, massy walls of the fortress, looming up, and marking their broad outlines against the western sky, became discernable to the men. And yet, as they drew near these frowning walls, pierced by a hundred cannon, over which, for aught they knew, the lighted matches were suspended, awaiting but the signal to send their iron showers of death to every man of their devoted band, on misgivings, no weak relentings came over them: but at a moment like this, and that which followed at the onset,—moments, furnishing, perhaps, a more undoubted test of courage than those of the half frantic, half mechanical charges of the disciplined legions of Napoleon, at the later fields of Austerlitz and Marengo—at a moment like this, we say, their stout hearts, nothing daunted at the dangers before them, beat high and proudly at the thought of the coming encounter, and with stern determination gleaming in every eye, and with the low whispered words of impatience for the moment of action to arrive, they moved steadily on to their daring purpose. Passing down obliquely by the works, they landed some distance to the north of them. The instant they touched the shore the troops leaped on the banks; and scarcely had the last foot been lifted from the boats before they were backed, wheeled, and on their return for another load, leaving those on shore to await in silence the arrival of a reinforcement from their companions left behind, before marching to the onset. Those companions, howevever, were not destined to share in the glory of this splendid achievement of the eighty Green Mountain Boys who had landed: for in a few moments, to the dismay of Allen, the faint suffusions of dawning day became visible in the east. Cursing the luck which had caused such delays, and chafing like a chained lion held back from his prey, that impetuous leader for a few moments rapidly paced the shore before his men, in an agony of impatience,—now casting an eager look at the fort, still silent and undisturbed, now straining his vision after the receding boats, which, to him, seemed to move like snails across the waters, and now throwing an uneasy glance at the reddening east, whose twilight glow, growing broader and brighter every instant, plainly told him that before another detachment of troops could arrive, his forces would be discovered, and the enterprise, in all probability, would thus be defeated. Maddened at the thought, he stopped short in his walk, paused an instant, and brought his foot with a significant stamp to the ground, showing that his resolution was taken. And quickly calling out Jones and Neshobee, he dispatched them to go forward, cautiously reconnoiter the fort on all sides, and return as speedily as possible to report their discoveries. He then formed his men in three ranks and addressed them. `You see, my friends and fellow soldiers,' he commenced, pointing his sword towards the east, `that day light will reveal us to the enemy before a reinforcement can possibly arrive. But can you, who have so long been the scourge of tyrants, bring your minds to relinquish this noble enterprise, and with it the proud name you have achieved, by turning your backs on the glorious prize, when it is now almost within your grasp?' He paused for a reply; when `no! no! no!' ran through the lines in eager response. `I see, I see, my brave fellows,' resumed the gratified leader, `I see what you would do. I read it in your deeply breathed tenes of determination—in your quick and short drawn respirations, and in your restless and impatient movements. But have you all well considered? I now propose to lead you through yonder gate; and I fear not to tell men of your stamp, that we incur no small hazard of life in the attempt. And, as I would urge no man to engage against his own free will, I now give free and full permission to all, who choose, to remain behind. You, therefore, who will voluntarily accompany me, poise your guns!' Every man's gun was instantly brought to a poise, with a motion which told with what good will it was made. `God bless you, my noble fellows!' exclaimed Allen, proudly, and with emotion: `Courage like that'—he continued, in tenes of concentrated energy, `courage like that, with hearts of oak, and nerves of steel like yours, must, will, and, by the help of the God of hosts, shall triumph! Come on, then! follow me—march while I march—run and rush when I set the example; and if I fall, still rush on, and over me, to vengeance and victory! To the right wheel! march!' When the band arrived within about a furlong of the ramparts, they were met by the scouts, who reported that all was quiet in and about the fort, while the open gate was guarded only by one sluggish and sleepy looking sentinel. Halting no longer than was necessary to hear this report, Allen, placing himself at the head of the centre column, silently waved his sword to the troops as a signal for resuming the march; when they all again moved forward with rapid but cautious steps towards the guarded gateway. And so noiseless and unexpected was their approach, that they came within twenty paces of the entrance before they were discovered by the drowsy sentry, who was slowly pacing to and fro, with shouldered musket before it. Turning round with a start, the aroused soldier glared an instant at the advancing array, in mute astonishment and alarm; when he hastily cocked, and levelled his piece at Allen, who was striding towards him, several yards in advance of his men. It was an instant on which hung the fate of the hero of the Green Mountains, and probably, also the destinies of Ticonderoga. But the gun missed fire. The life of the daring leader was safe, and the garrison slept on, unalarmed, and unconscious of their danger. Leaping forward like the bounding tiger on his victim, Allen followed up the retreating soldier so hotly that, with all the speed which fear could lend him, he could scarcely keep clear of the rapidly whirling sword of his fiery pursuer, till he gained the interior of the fortress; when he gave a loud screech of alarm, and, making a desperate leap for a bomb proof, disappeared within its recesses. Meanwhile, the rushing column of troops came sweeping like a whirlwind through the gate; when, fairly gaining the parade ground in front of the barracks, they gave three cheers which made the old walls tremble with the deafening reverberations, and caused the slumbering garrison to start from their beds in wild dismay at the unwonted sound. Scarcely had the last huzza escaped the lips of the men and their leader, who disdained not to mingle his own stentorian voice in the peals of exultation and defiance, which rose in thunders to heaven, before the latter was rapidly threading his way through flying sentries and half dressed officers, towards the quarters of the commandant of the fortress. Pausing an instant on his way, to chastize a dastard sentinel whom he caught making a pass at one of our officers with his bayonet, and whom, with one blow with the flat of his sword, he sent reeling to the earth with the cry of mercy on his lips, the daring leader bounded up the stair-way leading to the commandant's room, and thundering at the door, called loudly to that officer to come forth. Captain La Place, who had just leaped from his bed, on hearing the tumult below, soon made his appearance with his clothes in his hand, but suddenly recoiling a step, he stood gazing in mute amazement at the stern and threatening air, and the powerful and commanding figure of the man before him. `I come, sir, to demand the immediate surrender of this fortress!' sternly said Allen, to the astonished commander. `By what authority do you make this bold demand of His Majesty's fort, sir?' said the other, almost distrusting his senses. `By what authority?' thundered Allen. `I demand it, sir, in the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!' `The continental Congress?' stammered the hesitating 5 officer, `I know of no right—I don't acknowledge it, sir'— `But you soon will acknowledge it, sir!' fiercely interrupted the impatient leader. `And hesitate to obey me one instant longer, and by the eternal heavens! I will sacrifice every man in your fort!—beginning the work, sir,' he added, whirling his sword furiously over the head of the other, and bringing the murderous blade at every glittering circle it made in the air, nearer and nearer the head of its threatened victim, `beginning the work, sir, by sending your own head dancing across this floor!' `I yield, I yield!' cried the shrinking commandant. `Down! down, then, instantly!' exclaimed Allen, `and communicate the surrender to your men while any of them are left alive to hear it!' Scarcely allowing the crest-fallen officer time to encase his legs in his breeches, Allen hurried him down to the scene of action, in the open parade below. Here they found the Green Mountain Boys eagerly engaged in the work of capturing the garrison, who were making considerable show of resistance. Two of the barrack doors had been beaten down, and about a third of the enemy already made prisoners. And the fiery Arnold was on the point of blowing a third door from its hinges with a swivel, which he had caused to be drawn up for the purpose; while a fourth was shaking and tottering under the tremendous blows of an axe, wielded by the long and powerful arms of Pete Jones, who was found among the foremost in the contest. `Cease, cease ye, all!' cried Allen, in the loud voice of command, as he appeared among them with La Place by his side. `Now, raaly, Colonel,' said Jones, suspending his elevated implement, and holding it back over his head in readiness for another blow, `I wish you would let me settle with this deivelish old oak door before I stop. Why, I never was so bothered with such a small potato in my life!' `No, no!' answered the other, smiling, `let us have silence a moment, and we will save you all troubles of that kind.' `Well, then, here goes for a parting blessing!' exclaimed the woodsman, bringing down his axe with a tremendous blow, which brought the shattered door tumbling to the ground. The British commandant then calling his officers around him, informed them that he had surrendered the fortress, and ordered them to parade the men without arms. While this was in performance, a second detachment of Green Mountain Boys reached the shore, and, having eagerly hastened on to the fort to join their companions, now with Warrington at their head, came pouring into the arena. A single glance sufficed to tell the latter, that he was too late to participate in aught but the fruits of the victory. With a disappointed and mortified air he halted his men, and approached to the side of his leader. `Ah! Colonel,' said he, `is this the way you appropriate all the laurels to yourself, entirely forgetful of your friends?' `Pooh! pooh! Charles,' replied Allen, turning to the other with a soothing, yet self complaisant smile, at the half reproachful compliment thus conveyed, `you need not mourn much lost glory in this affair. Why, the stupid devils did not give us fight enough to whet our appetites for breakfast! But never mind, Charles, there is more business yet to be done; Crown Point and Major Skene's stone castle must both be ours to-night. The taking of the first shall be yours to perform. And after breakfast and a few bumpers in honor of our victory, we will dispatch you for that purpose, with a corps of your own selection.' `Thank you, thank you, Colonel,' replied the other with a grateful smile. But the expedition to Skenesboro'—may I not speak a word for our friend, Selden?' `Aha?' replied Allen, laughing, `then his offer to take charge of the negro's letter had its meaning, eh? I don't know exactly about that chip of a British Colonel for a Yankee patriot. Now, yours, Major, I acknowledge to be a true Cynosure. But his, I fear, will prove a Dog-star. However, that is his own hunt; and as he is a finished fellow, and doubtless, brave and true, I think I will give him the command of the expedition, unless claimed by Easton. But hush! the commandant is about to go through the forms of the surrender. I must away, but will see you again.' The brief ceremonies of the surrender were soon over; when, as the fortress was pronounced to be in full possession of the conquerors, the heavens were again rent by the reiterated huzzas of the Green Mountain Boys, while British cannon were made to peal forth with their deep-mouthed thunders to the trembling hills and reverberating mountains of the country around, the proclamation of victory!—the first triumph of Young Freedom over the arms of her haughty oppressor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “A thousand evil things there are that hate To look on happiness; these hurt impeae, And leagued with time, circumstance and fate, Keep kindred heart from heart, to pine and pant and bleed.” Mrs. Brooks. It is time, perhaps, that we should recur a little, to trace the operations of some personages of our story, whose agency, though unnoted by us through several of the last chapters, had yet, in the mean while, been actively exercised in bringing about the events that were destined to follow. And it is with a sort of reluctance of feeling that we turn from the soul-kindling task of describing the noble exploits of Allen and his patriot companions, to the low and despicable plottings of the base Sherwood, and his still more execrable associate in crime. Though twice foiled in his attempts to procure the destruction of Warrington, under the sanction of a despotic law, of which advantage was taken mainly to cloak the true motives of the act,—though signally defeated in this, and the bolder attempt at assassination, which was subsequently made at his instigation, yet still restless as the dark spirit of evil, this plotter of mischief, instead of relinquishing his object, was now only the more intently engaged in devising and putting in practice, new ways of accomplishing his nefarious designs. On the evening that Darrow had attempted the life of Warrington in the woods, Sherwood was sitting in his house, which was kept by a simple couple, 5* wholly in the interests of their employer. He had just arrived from a visit to the house of Captain Hendee, where, as the reader has been apprised, he had been sowing the seeds of discord in that hapless family. And the chilly reception, with which his parting advances had been met by the indignant girl, whom they were intended to soften and deceive, more than ever confirming him in what his jealousy had long since suggested, that her inclinations were setting strongly towards his hated rival, and foreseeing that some thing must speedily be done to counteract the current, he was now revolving over the different schemes that rose in his teeming brain for effecting his purpose, in case of the failure of his minion to remove the object, alike of his hatred and his fears. While thus occupied in mind, Darrow, whose coming was not wholly unlooked for, arrived, and sulkily entered the apartment. `Ah, Darrow!' exclaimed Sherwood, with his usual hypocritical smile, `very glad to see you. I knew not whether you would come to night, or return to the fort.' `Why,' replied the other, `when I concluded to give it up for a d—n bad day's work, I found myself nearer your house than the fort; so I came, that's all.' `Glad you did. So come, unrig, and sit down. The old woman, in the other room, will have us some supper ready soon. But no luck with your rifle to day?' said Sherwood with a significant smile. `None—except getting half tired to death, in this cursed wild goose chase of yours,' petulantly replied the surly minion. `What! not even get a sight of the game, after so much beating of the bush?' `Yes, twice; and failed both times, as the devil, who sent me on the errand, would have it,' answered Darrow, with an equivocal glance at the other. `Failed! how?' said Sherwood, without appearing to notice the half intentional sarcasm of Darrow. `Why, the first time, the devilish rifle missed fire, for a rarity—the second, its owner missed his aim, and had to take to his legs to save his bacon.' `All this is very singular, Mr. Darrow,' observed Sherwood, with a disappointed, and somewhat incredulous look. `Yes, but true for all that. Believe it or not, just as you please, I care not a groat.' `What mean you, Darrow?' `Exactly what I say; and I am beginning to mean something more, too.' `You are a strange fellow, Darrow. But let us have all your meanings, wants, and wishes, in a lump. I am now in no humour for riddles.' `Nor I neither. Well, then, though the fellow escaped my bullet by no intended fault of mine, yet I am not sorry I missed him. I have been thinking over the business coming along, and for all your talk about his life being forfeited, I can't make it out much better than killing—not to use a worse word,— which they say gives a fellow ugly dreams. So I have made up my mind to let you do your own jobs of this sort, in future. And if you persist in urging me further'— `Killing! who asked you to kill him?' interrupted Sherwood in feigned surprise. `Curse you, Jake, you know well enough you meant that. But I am still willing to help take the fellow, and hand him over to the Yorkers to punish, or lend you a hand to carry any other point, if you will do the clean thing by me. But in the first place you must tell me what you fear from this fellow, and why you are so specially set on having him taken, more than Allen, or any other outlaw?' `That is more than I intended to tell any one; but as I suppose you will better serve my interests by understanding this, you shall know the whole business: well, after I had been here awhile, I noticed that the girl, when the Captain said any thing in praise of this Howard, as he supposed his name was, never joined her father in praises of the fellow, though she never had any ears for any thing else while the slightest mention was made of him. And if I so much as asked a question implying a doubt about the fellow's perfection, she would show resentment as plain as looks could do it. Now, Darrow, if you would discover whether a girl entertains any secret liking for a man, just introduce his name in her presence, contriving both to praise and censure him, and if she refuse to join you in either, but is all attention when you praise, and grows restless when you censure him, you may safely set it down that love is secretly lurking about her heart. It was something like this that led me to think, that this Howard had made an impression, which I little relished. This suspicion caused me to to obtain from the old Captain a minute description of the fellow, and having before had one of Warrington, it occurred to me that this favorite might be no other than the outlaw, himself. And being determined to ascertain whether my conjectures were correct, I made a secret journey to Bennington, where I got a sight at Warrington, and where, by professing great wrath against the Yorkers, I was let into secrets which confirmed me in my suspicions. There, also, I made arrangements for being apprised of Warrington's future movements with one Willoughby, who sent the word, which enabled me to ferret out him and his band at Lake Dunmore. All this, however, I kept secret from the Hendees, but took especial pains to inspire the old man, and more particularly his daughter, with a horror of the character of Warrington. And now, Darrow, after the insufferable scoundrel has caused me to be tied up and whipped like a dog, and, to cap the climax, has found his way into this family, and attempted to beguile from me my betrothed, can you ask why I wish to see him brought to justice?' `Why, you seem to make out considerable of a case of it, to be sure,' replied the other carelessly, as he rolled his tobacco quid in his lips. `But betrothed do you call her? Why, I thought you cared so little about the girl, that you was quite undetermined whether you would have her, or not?' `Well, whatever I may have said before, I am not undetermined now,—for the girl, in spite of men, or devils, I swear I will have!' `What mighty object is there, Jake, in breaking your neck for her? Besure, she is a snug piece enough, but you can catch other fish as fair, and those, too, who will bring you hundreds to her none.' `I have plenty of objects to answer: one is to defeat this hated scoundrel,—another, to punish her for presuming to like him. I don't say now I will marry her. But she shall be mine, to do with as I choose. I will have her, and keep her in a spot where it shall be mine, not hers, to decide whose wife she shall become. That, indeed, was mainly my motive in drawing her into an engagement in the first place: for you know, Darrow, that in case the old concerns should happen to be ripped up, a matrimonial plaster would cure all. And so long as I kept things in this posture, I should have the remedy at hand.' `Yes, but what chance do you consider there is of ripping up old matters?' asked the Sergeant, throwing a keen enquiring glance at the other. `Why, such a thing is possible, you know. The old man, my father, I mean, as he grows weak and childish, may repent, and kick over his own kettle, and, of course, mine. Indeed, I have great fears of this: for, though he never said any thing to me of the kind, not dreaming that I ever met with you here, or discovered by any other means the secrets of his former management, yet I have lately observed in him a sort of growing uneasiness, a whining, melancholly way, which, with his great anxiety that I should marry this girl, has made me rather jealous, that his firmness is giving way in this quarter. Besides this, there are other dangers: that boy, who, you say the old man still thinks, was done for, may yet be alive, and return to make me trouble.' `Well, if he should, he would be a no very lousy foe for you to contend with, Jake,—that is, if he is as smart for a man as he was for a boy—I tell you, he was a bright one for a four-year old. I liked him, and never had the least notion of harming a hair of his head.' `What object had you, then, in making the old man believe as you did?' `Why, I mistrusted that would please the old man best, and I'll be hanged if I don't believe it did, Jake, if he is your father.' `Well, there are these chances against me, and then'— `And then Bill Darrow may leak, you was going to say, was you, Jake?' sneeringly asked the minion. `O, no!' quickly responded the consummate dissembler with a gracious smile, and a surprised air, as if such a thought never entered his head. `No, indeed. I should as soon fear myself. But I was thinking, and about to say, that besides these chances, Warrington's communication with the girl will prove dangerous to my plans, and that they must be stopped.' `Well, how are you a going to do it, short of following up the plan we have already been acting on to so little purpose?' `Why, I have already taken one step to day, by informing Hendee, that his friend Howard was no less than the outlaw Warrington in disguise. This, was touching fire to his gun-powder temper; and has pretty effectually blown the fellow up as regards any open communication with the girl.' `That may be, but it has also blown up your best trap for taking him, you see, don't you?' `Perhaps so, but I dare not risk his visits with the standing he evidently held in their minds. And now having broken off all open intercourse between the girl and the audacious rascal, we must go to work to sunder those ties, which may yet secretly remain.' `Hum! That, I should think, would be like trying to cut off sun-beams with a jack-knife. I should like to know how the old boy you calculate to do that?' `O, easy enough, though my plan is not quite made up. I will tell you in the morning. But will you assist me in carrying it out?' `Don't know but I will. But supposing I do, and see you fairly through the whole scrape, what do you finally intend to do for me?' `Any thing almost that you may ask, Darrow. You will own that the earnest money I gave you the other day was a handsome affair?' `Hum!—Yes, decent.' `Well, from the late news, I suppose we shall have war. Warrington and most of these rascally settlers will be with the rebels. I, from several motives, shall go for the king. And I have made up my mind to get a Captain's commission, and raise a company to act in this quarter. You shall be my Lieutenant. And then we will use up these refractory settlers in a way they little dream of. But hark! The old woman is rapping for us to come to supper. I will mature my plans, and open them to you, as I said, in the morning.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing (Always reserv'd my holy duty,) what His rage can do on me. You must begone And I shall here abide the hourly shot Of angry eyes; not comforted to live, But that there is this jewel in the world, That I may see again.” The developement made by Sherwood, at his late visit, seemed to produce on Captain Hendee, whose mind had been previously prejudiced and poisoned for the purpose, all the effect which the former could have desired. The Captain's feelings of pride were deeply touched at the thought of having entertained, and welcomed in his family, a man acting under the disguise of an assumed name, and consequently harboring, as he reasoned, no honorable purposes. And these views going to confirm all the falsehoods and dark insinuations, by which that Iago in malice and subtlety had accompanied his disclosures concerning Warrington, the mind of the irritable old gentleman had been wrought up to a pitch of exasperation and bitterness, which he pretended neither to disguise nor control, and which he failed not to vent on all around him, but more particularly upon his unhappy daughter. To her, indeed, his whole demeanor became changed; and his treatment was marked by a distrustful coldness, and continued austerity of manner, which she had never before, for so long a time, experienced from her passionate, but hitherto quickly relenting, parent. And yet she, who was happily the very reverse of her father in temper, had 6 neither manifested, nor felt, the least wish to resent the unkindness; but calm and aimiable in disposition, as she was fearless and spirited in action, she had borne all with the most forgiving patience, prudently awaiting the subsiding of the tempest of his passion, before she should attempt, as she was resolved to do, to exculpate Warrington, and gradually bring about a change in his views and feelings, in regard to the connection with Sherwood. She well knew that he was now laboring under many false impressions, which she felt conscious of her ability to remove, as soon as he should become sufficiently calm to listen to the voice of reason. Day after day, therefore, she had anxiously watched for some appearance of relenting, some more softened mood, which should afford her an opportunity of making this attempt with a reasonable hope of success. But till the evening on which Jones called at the house, she had observed nothing that indicated the least relaxation in her father's feelings. And being then interrupted by the woodsman's call, at an hour which usually afforded her the only opportunity she had through the day of conversing with her parent alone, she deferred her purpose to another day. But the next day brought along with it events, which so engrossed her time and attention, that this desired object was not again sought to be obtained, till circumstances intervened, which destroyed every motive and wish she could entertain for accomplishing it. Such was the state of feelings, and such the relative position in which the father and daughter stood towards each other on the day which proved so triumphant to the American arms on lake Champlain. In the early part of that day the attention of this family, as well as that of all the inhabitants of the vicinity of the lake, was aroused by heavy and repeated discharges of cannon, in the direction of Ticonderoga. Little dreaming of the fact that this cannonading, which was filling the whole valley of the lake with its echoing thunders, was the harbinger of a victory already won, the whole neighborhood was instantly in commotion,—some riding post haste into the interior to carry the news, or rally volunteers, some flying from house to house to interchange the expressions of their fears and sympathies, and the greater number, rushing down to the nearest landing on the lake shore, to gain the first tidings of their friends engaged in the deadly conflict, which they supposed was at that moment raging round the walls of the hostile fortress. In a short time the door yard of Captain Hendee's cottage was filled with a group of excited boys and anxious females. And agonizing were the sensations of many an affectionate wife and sister, and oft and fervent their trembling ejaculations to Heaven for the preservation of husbands, brothers and lovers, in this hour of danger. And not the most indifferent among those thus oppressed with painful solicitude for the event, which they believed involved the fate of all they held dear on earth, was Alma Hendee. To her, whose lover might be expected to be among the foremost of those engaged in the perilous assault, every gun that came booming over the waters brought with it a pang for her agitated bosom. Nor was her anxiety the less painfully felt, because circumstances compelled her to endure it in silence. The firing at length ceased, and all awaited in trembling solicitude some arrival, which should bring them information of the result. This, however, continued for several, and to most of them, long and tedious hours, to rest in uncertainty. But at length a horseman, covered with dust, and lashing his foaming horse to speed, came furiously galloping down the road from the south. All, with beating hearts and breathless expectation, awaited the announcement of the rapidly approaching messenger. The next moment, as he neared them, he swung his hat round his head, exclaiming `Victory! victory! hurra for the Green Mountain Boys! Ticonderoga is taken, and not a man killed! hurra! hurra!' and, without scarcely checking the speed of his horse, on he dashed, to carry to others the joyful tidings. The cracked voice of the war-worn and veteran Hendee was the next instant mingling with the shrill and high keyed cry of the boys around him, in the responsive hurra that now involuntarily burst from their lips. With tears of joy and thankfulness gushing over many a fair cheek, the females hurried on such habiliments as they had laid aside, and the company, immediately dispersing, hastened to their respective homes with the gladdening news, leaving Captain Hendee and his daughter again by themselves, and their cottage to relapse into its usual quietness. The day, however, was not destined to close upon them without the occurrence of other events of stirring interest. Towards sunset, several batteaux filled with armed men, made their appearance on the lake, approaching from the south, and as they neared, were soon discovered to be bearing down upon the fortress of Crown Point. `Bring me out my old spy glass, Alma!' cried Captain Hendee, hobbling from the garden, where he had been to work, towards the house, and turning round every few steps to look at the little armament, which he had discovered approaching. `Here comes more trouble for the British—or else that fellow fooled us with his news, and these are a reinforcement for the garrison. Come, step quick, girl, I can't make them out with certainty.' `Would British troops be likely to come in that direction, father?' asked Alma, in accents tremulous with emotion, as she approached, and handed the required instrument to the other. `Why, no, I should hardly have expected it; but let us see,' replied the Captain, adjusting his glass and placing it to his eye. `By heavens, the girl is right! Those boats contain any thing but British regulars. No, they must be Green Mountain Boys, about to make an onset on the fort. See! how stiffly they bear down towards the old walls!' he continued with animation. `Gad! they are bold fellows, to say the least, to be sailing directly in the teeth of yonder war-dogs! But here, child, your eye is keener than mine;—take the glass and watch their movements.' The girl took the glass, and bringing the boats within its field of vision, looked long and intently without speaking. `They are coming to a halt now, are they not?' asked the Captain. `Yes, they have nearly ceased rowing now,' replied the maiden. `Why, how plainly I can see even their features! Now there is one, who has mounted a bench, and appears to be giving commands to the rest. Now he has turned his face this way, as if—as if'— `Why! how unsteady the girl's hand is! nonsense! child, you need not be frightened,—they are not coming near us,' half pettishly, half encouragingly, exclaimed the Captain, supposing his daughter's 6* very visible agitation proceeded from an apprehension that the commander was about to order the boats to cross over the lake towards the house. `I am not afraid, father, only—but see! their boats are turning to the shore. They appear now to be putting into a small cove.' `There is where they are cunning,' observed the other. `They don't think it altogether safe to approach much nearer in the range of those murderous long guns. If I had been there in command of the fort, I think they would have seen trouble some time ago. Thank God, however, the stupid fools within there have lost their best chance! But what are they doing now?' `They have landed, nearly all landed now, and seem to be forming on the bank.' “Good! now, Alma, you will have a chance to see a little of your father's old trade—that is, if the garrison have sense and courage enough to make use of the advantages they possess for repelling their assailants. Are they moving forward yet for the fort?' `No, the commander appears to be addressing two men apart from the rest, one of whom seems to be unrolling something white. Ah! I see, now; it is a white flag. The two now advance along the path leading to the fort, while the rest appear to stand in a waiting attitude, anxiously watching the motions of their two companions as they approach the gate.' `It is a summons from the commander, girl—a summons for the surrender of the fort. Now you will see whether they will obey it, and yield without a blow the prize that cost the king so much toil and blood in the winning, as my sad experience can well attest. Many a dark and fearful night, Alma, have I ranged these woods, while the savage foe were lurking around us in every direction. Old Major Put, as we used to call that dare-devil, and myself once'— `There! there! father,' interrupted the other, `the messengers have now approached near to the walls. A man appears on the top. They are conferring together. The messengers point to their companions. The man on the walls seems to hesitate. They now seem to direct his attention to something down the lake. Look, father, and see if any thing is to be seen coming in that direction.' `Now the Lord be with the assailants for a sudden rush, or their game is up!' exclaimed the Captain as, in compliance with his daughter's request, he turned and threw an enquiring look along the lake towards the north. `Two boats filled with armed men are coming up the lake rowing for life— British, no doubt, hastening to succour the garrison.' `No, father, no!' joyfully exclaimed the girl as with trembling haste she turned the glass to the armament in question. `You are again mistaken. These, too, are Green Mountain Boys, coming on to join their companions.' `Green Mountain Boys! from that quarter? where should they come from?' `From the Winooski river, father. Captain Baker has been on there, and'—eagerly replied the other, but stopping short and blushing, as it occurred to her that the remark would lead to the discovery of the source of her information. `Really, girl! one would suppose you had been at the council of war, where this campaign was planned,' said the Captain, with an air of surprise; but being too much occupied with present objects to trace the association, he, to the great relief of his confused daughter, reverted to the scene before him, and said, `You may be right after all,—if so, victory is certain. But turn now to the fort and see what is going on there.' `I will—I am, father,' replied the flustered girl. `Ah! I have a view again: now the conference between the commander, or man on the walls and the two messengers, seems to be broken off. The latter are departing. But now the man seems to be calling them back. They turn to him again and hold parley. Now the messengers turn quickly round, and wave their flag to their companions, who seem suddenly to be put in motion. And, see! see! their whole body is rushing towards the fort. How their guns glimmer through the trees as they pour along the path! How their commander's sword flashes in the sun, as half turning, he whirls it about his head to motion them on! There! there! father, they mount the swell!—they approach the walls—the gate is thrown open; and now they disappear within the works, and all is still.' `And all without a single gun being fired in defence of Old Frederick! impossible!' exclaimed the Captain, with mingled feelings of joy for the success of his countrymen, and shame for the garrison, who would surrender, without resistance, a fortress which years of his life had been spent in helping to wrest from the Frenchmen. `Here! look, look, father!' again exclaimed the excited girl. `The Lion flag goes down! another of a lighter colour goes up! Have they not conquered, father?—They have! They have! and oh! how thankful!' `Yes! 'tis all over!' responded the Captain, rubbing his hands in extacy. `Quick work, by heavens! Not a gun fired!—not a man killed, and the old Lion is flat on his back! The command of the whole of lake Champlain is ours! Huzza for liberty!' he shouted, leaping from the ground, forgetful of his lameness in the excitement of the moment, and throwing his hat into the air: `Huzza for the Green Mountain Boys! They deserve a hecatomb for their victories!' At this instant a dozen columns of smoke shot out fiercely from the walls of the fortress, and the deafening peal of cannon, which followed, announced to the shuddering hills around the surrender of the last controlling foot-hold of British power on the waters of Lake Champlain, to the prowess and patriotism of the Green Mountain Boys. Alma now delivering up the spy-glass to her father, hastened into the house, and took a seat in her window, where, unobserved by any, she could observe what further movements might transpire at the scene of action, and at the same time freely indulge in her emotions of joy and gratitude for the preservation of her lover, whom she had distinctly made out to be the leader of the victorious party. An hour or two after the surrender, a skiff, containing a single individual, put off from the shore under the fort, and directed its course to the landing below the cottage. The individual, on reaching the shore, came directly towards the house, and was soon ascertained to be Neshobee by the Captain, who, still remaining in his garden, had been watching the coming boat. The Indian rather sheepishly approached his master, conscious, perhaps, that as far as regarded the Captain, he had played the truant in joining the expedition. `Well, Neshobee,' said the Captain, as the other, with averted face came carelessly along, `where have you been all this time?' `Umph! me been go learn fight um.' `I thought it likely enough they had got you away for that, as I suspected, from several things I noticed yesterday, that this business was afoot. But how did you know I should be willing you should join in these doings?' `What you tell big Cappen—Colonel, who make believe drunk todder night?' `Well, well, my lad, I don't mean to scold you much for joining in so good a work, though you might have talked with me a little before you went. But have you been with the big Captain, who is no other than Ethan Allen, Mr. Sherwood informed me?' `Me have.' `Well, he was commander of the expedition, I suppose—what did he and his men do there at Ticonderoga?' `They take um red-coats,—pile up their guns for no let um have um more,—fire big guns, more fifty —hoo! bang!' replied the Indian with significant gestures. `And was it the big Captain who come on with the men to take this fort?' `No, young Cappen, Major, what you call Misser Howard.' `Well, you may go, now,' said Hendee, impatiently, motioning the other to go on to the house. `How proud I should now be of that same Warrington, outlaw though he be, but for this accursed business!' muttered the Captain to himself, after the Indian had departed, with a tone and manner in which admiration and dislike, kindness and resentment, regret and bitterness, were strangely blended. `Hang me! if I don't almost think the better of the girl for liking him. Though if Jake's stories are true!—I wonder now if the fellow did not lie to me? —would to God things had been different! But they are not different, and won't be; and hell town I what am I talking about? It can't go—no, no! and by the powers of earth! it shan't go, an inch further, or I will make the house too hot for her!' While the passionate and unhappy father was thus giving vent to his conflicting feelings, the Indian entered the house, and proceeded to the apartment of the daughter, who had also noted his approach, and beckoned him from the window to come to her room. `Now tell me, in the first place, Neshobee,' said she eagerly, `whether Mr. Sherwood was over there to be taken prisoner with the rest?' `Me no see him.' `You said yesterday, he was then there.' `Me see him, as me say, then,—no there to day when we come—guess him run.' `Very likely, but Darrow was there, of course, was he not?' `Him no there, too.' `How unfortunate!' exclaimed the maiden with an air of disappointment and regret. `Not even one of them, then, is secured! Well, well, Heaven knows best; and in that I will still put my trust. But what have you there? she added, as her quick eye caught the hand of the other fumbling for something in his pocket. `Cappen send um,' quietly answered Neshobee, pulling out a billet, which was instantly snatched from his hands by the eager girl. `O, why not have told me, before! But you may go now, Neshobee;' and with a quick, impatient waving of her hand, she motioned him away. With a beating heart and glowing cheek, the happy girl read, and re-read, many times, the precious note; when, after pondering anxiously and deeply, awhile, she took her sheet and wrote.— “Your few lines, my dear sir, have been received, and read, I know not how many times over, and with an interest which I dare not acknowledge. Your propositions, too, have been all candidly, and even anxiously weighed. And it is with many, very many regrets, my more than friend, that I am forced to the conclusion that, at present, it were better, that they be not complied with. You first propose to come here openly, explain to my father the reasons which compelled you to that course, which he pretends so much to censure, and claim the privilege of addressing me:—all the explanations, which it may be needful to make, would, I am satisfied, with my father's present feelings and impressions, be better listened to from me than yourself. And most assuredly they shall be made to him as soon as his mood shall be such as shall warrant the belief that they will be received, without passion or prejudice. And before you take the step you propose, I could wish also to see to some change in his views relative to the match he has marked out for me. And changed, believe me, they sooner or later will be. Reason will at length resume her sway; and, to say nothing of your character, the character of one of whom I would not willingly speak my opinion, must soon be better known to him. And he will see, and feel, for himself, that his present requirements are neither wise nor generous. But do not, for my sake, for your own sake, beloved friend, attempt to accomplish all this now, under circumstances so inauspicious: for I feel it would be useless; and not only so, but lead, probably, to the defeat of the objects, and consequently the happiness of us both. No, Warrington, be patient, trust in Heaven to expose guilt, and reward inocence, and rely on the constancy of her, who is resolved to bring about a state of things when her lover can be received in her father's house with the kindness and respect to which he is entitled. “As an alternative, in case I disapprove your first proposal, you request to be favored with secret, or stolen interviews,—Warrington, Charles Warrington! would you recommend such a course to a beloved sister? With your delicacy of sentiment, with your admiration of exalted virtue, I know you would not. Why, then, ask it of one whom you propose to make more than a sister? Again, dearest friend, I must say to you, no! I have ever disapproved of clandestine meetings:—there is an air of guilt about them—a something that seems to imply a consciousness of wrong, which innocence and rectitude of purpose should never stoop thus tacitly to acknowledge. And the same views, which have led to the disapprobation of these, have, in most respects, an equal application to the measure that you hint it may be expedient for us, as a final resort, to adopt,—a private elopement. In some countries, and in some states of society, such a measure may, perhaps, be sometimes justifiable; but is it so in a land like ours, where force is rarely, if ever, used, to defeat the engagements of lovers? While armed with the panoply of virtue and reason, and possessed of the moral courage which these should ever 7 impart, few females, I apprehend, need here resort to this questionable practice. And were I to be wed to you to day, Mr. Warrington, it should be done openly, and, if permitted, in the presence of my natural protector. But if the ceremony were forbidden, I would then, after frankly apprising him of my intentions, as openly depart with you to a place where it would be allowed. And if force were employed to restrain me, I would then throw myself on the protection of him who would defend, or deserve to lose me.” “You know not how rejoiced is my heart to hear of your personal safety,—how proud to learn your brilliant successes, and how gratified at the promotion you have received. You say you are about to proceed south, to make enlistments for an expedition into Canada. Go!—deserve well of your country, be true and constant, and, while you remain what I now believe you, count me so, and be assured, that all the reward that this poor heart and hand can confer, shall be eventually yours. My prayers will attend you amidst the perils of war. Apprise me often—as often as possible, of your situation. And, notwithstanding I have declined your present proposals, O, do not believe me now, do not hereafter think me, less devotedly yours. Alma. When Alma had finished her letter, she sought her trusty messenger, and confided it to his charge, with instructions to convey it to Warrington at the fort that night, or as soon as he could absent himself without exciting the observation of her father; after which she again returned to her solitary apartment, and soon sought her pillow, to escape the perplexities of the present in the bright visions of the future. During the next day, her time and attention were more than usually occupied by calls at the house, from those passing to and from the fort. And it was not till nearly night, that she found an opportunity to escape from the company, with which, in successive parties, the cottage had been thronged through the day. But being relieved at length from these hospitable duties, and wearied with bustle, in which she had been engaged, she threw a light kerchief over her head, and wandered into the fields to indulge in those solitary musings so grateful to seperated lovers. The golden sun was just sinking behind the western hills. The earth was a variegated carpet of flowers beneath her feet; and tempted by the beauty of the evening, she continued her course almost unconsciously, down the little vale towards the woods; and before she was aware how far she had wandered, she had arrived at the border of the field, and was standing by the tree beneath which Warrington had first breathed to her the word `love.' After indulging awhile in the associations which this sequestered spot awakened in her mind, she turned, and was retracing her steps homeward, when she was startled by the sharp rattling voice of some one a few rods below her, and turning, she beheld Pete Jones making his way up the slope towards her. `Hold up a little bit there, lady, that is, if you're a mind to,' he said, respectfully approaching and holding up a letter between his thumb and finger. `There's a little concern of a letter, which Captain Selden handed me to give you.' `Indeed! an answer from Skenesboro' so soon?' said Alma, with a subsiding blush, which was raised by the thought first occurring to her mind that the message came from another quarter. `Answer to the letter the nigger had,—d'ye mean? —why, yes, rather spose so. Any how, I believe it came from that little hum-bird of a girl that we caught at that small scrape we had with the old podunk of a Scotchman and his folks, at the Lower Falls, a week or two ago.' `You mean Miss Reed, probably—have you been up to Skenesboro', since you were here?' `O, yes, a lot of us went up there yesterday, after things had been pretty well fixed at Old Ti.' `For what purpose, if I may ask, sir?' `Why only just to let the Major there know, that the Continental Congress had kinder taken a fancy to his stone house. At all events, Captain Selden told them something of that sort, as we made them all prisoners there.' `What! the ladies and all?—I trust they will have no reason to complain'— `Ah, you needn't borry no trouble there, mum, I guess. The ladies won't be very likely to cry their eyes out, at falling into the hands of such a chap as Captain Selden—now you see if they do? For instance, mum, by way of a similar,' continued Pete, beginning to look mischievous, being no longer able to keep down his ruling propensitiy for joking, `for instance, suppose now, that Major Warrington should come over here with men enough—and twouldn't take over a thousand neither, mayhap'— `You need not trouble yourself to explain, sir,' interrupted Miss Hendee, rather flurriedly. `The letter will inform me of all particulars, doubtless. You will now excuse me, as I must return. But perhaps you will go to the house for some refreshment, or to remain with us through the night?' `Why, no,—thank'ee mum,' replied the other,' a little abashed at the dignity which the girl had assumed. `No, I must be off to my traps: I am a sort of a water-mail to carry orders to day. Captain Selden sent me on, this morning, with dispatches to old thunder-bolt, Colonel Allen, you know. Well, the Colonel, he sent me with my little bird of a canoe agoing again, like a foot ball, down here to Crown Point, to notify the Major to come up to a council there, to-night, or in the morning. So you see I must put on with my errand, as I havn't been to the fort yet. You may just tell the old Captain at the house, if you're a mind to, that my ague, since I was there, hasn't been very desput, considering.' So saying, the jolly borderer turned, and bounded down the slope like a young colt, giving vent to the exuberance of his animal spirits, as soon as he was fairly out of the restraining presence of the lady, in his favorite old chorus, `Trol, lol, lol de larly!' Hastening to the house, and then to her room, Miss Hendee eagerly tore open the letter just received, and read as follows: `Be astonished, O, ye heavens! and Alma Hendee, be you thunder struck! as I know you will be, when you learn, that we are—every man of us,—the Major and all, prisoners of war! Yes, I am a second time a prisoner to Mr. Selden! What means it, Alma? There is some strange fatality about it, that passes my poor comprehension. O, for some one deeply skilled in scanning the future—some one gifted with the second sight, which is claimed by our Highland seers in Scotland, to divine to me the portent of this singular happening! How very surprised *7 we all were when they landed—a body of armed men—and marched up, taking possession of the yard, and disarming our soldiers. The Major was in the house, and never mistrusted, I really believe, what could be their object, till they had seized the sloop and batteaux, and by their rapid movements in surrounding the men, put it out of his power to make any resistance. All this was, seemingly, the work of a moment. And before we had recovered from the first shock of the surprise, Mr. Selden, who appeared to be chief in command, had entered the house, and, with drawn sword, stood before us. The Major then, indeed, began to show some symptoms of uneasiness—more, however, even then, I thought, at the presence of one, whom he evidently has both feared and hated, since the former visit, than because he really supposed he was in earnest about capturing the establishment. After Mr. Selden had politely saluted us, ladios, he bowed formally to the Major, who returned the compliment only by a vain attempt to get his organs of speech in motion. `Who?—what?—Hem!' he stammered, stepping restlessly about the room, and looking daggers at the other: `Why, sir—I should like to know, sir—yes, sir—let me tell you, sir, what I think of you, sir'— `O, never trouble yourself, Major,' replied Mr. S. with a satirical smile, `it might take you a longer time than I could possibly spare to devote to so unimportant a purpose.' `Why, sir!' resumed my doughty warrior of a lady's parlour,—`d—n you, sir! do you mean to insult, sir?—I'll just let you know, sir—you'll just please to walk out of the house, sir!' `O, be patient, Major,' rejoined Selden, with the most provoking coolness. `Let me explain to these ladies the nature of our call, lest they be unnecessarily alarmed.' He then informed us of the outbreaking of the war, the capture of Ticonderoga—and the determination of the Americans to possess themselves of this post, also; and consequently the necessity of our removal to some other place, to which he assured us of a safe escort. `Now, Major,' said he, turning to the other, who had several times broken in on Mr. S., `I have only to say to you, that both you, and all your men are prisoners of war.' Even then the Major could scarcely comprehend what had befallen him; for he again began to bluster and threaten. But Selden, at once cutting him short, ordered him away; when they both left the house together. I never saw creatures so puzzled and confounded as were Marge and Merry Skene. They neither knew what to say, or how to act. As for myself, I could hardly hold in till the gentlemen had left the room, when I fairly shed tears with the laughter, which I could not repress, at the ludicrous scene I had witnessed. In regard to the valient Major, he will not, probably, make much more fuss about the affair to day. To-morrow he will be considerably moved at the disaster; and by the next day, he will have so collected his ideas and his wrath, that he will be tremendously mad. They took the place about noon;—since which we ladies have held our council of war. And it has been decided that we take our departure to-morrow morning for Albany, where we shall at present remain, with a connection of the Skenes'. I should have certainly preferred, for myself, to go and reside with you. But I dare not name it to them; for the girls are already as jealous of me as witches; and I well knew, that should I make such a proposition, it would be attributed to a secret wish to be where I could see more of Mr. S. And further, I am not quite sure, but they might be so kind as to communicate their suspicions to father; for I have a father, who may claim a voice in some matters as well as you. Now don't draw any inferences from that observation, Alma; because, positively, there are none to draw. Mr. Selden handed me your letter, brought by black Jack, till he fell into the hands of the powers that be. I read it with much interest,—the more so, perhaps, as I thought of the possibility that we may yet have cause to mingle our sympathies. I shall probably remain with the Skenes till father returns—if he does return; for now we have war, I am rather uncertain what course he will pursue. Should he receive a commission that suits him, he may engage in the war. This, however, is doubtful. And I think it very likely he will remain neutral, as I suspect he thinks the government have not done him justice. At all events, I don't believe he feels very bitter towards the Americans; but if he does, I know of one who don't. P. S. Mr. Selden is to escort us in person to Albany; and what is better, the Major is compelled to go with the other prisoners to Ticonderoga. His face is most unreasonably long at this arrangement— I think he will be crazy by to-morrow. Marge is secretly rejoiced, and I know of another who is less sad about it than she might be. I have had a conversation with Mr. Selden, alone, which has shown me that he can be serious when he pleases. But I have no time left me to state particulars. In my next I will be more explicit. Adieu, adieu. Jessy.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">`Be astonished, O, ye heavens! and Alma Hendee, be you thunder struck! as I know you will be, when you learn, that we are—every man of us,—the Major and all, prisoners of war! Yes, I am a second time a prisoner to Mr. Selden! What means it, Alma? There is some strange fatality about it, that passes my poor comprehension. O, for some one deeply skilled in scanning the future—some one gifted with the second sight, which is claimed by our Highland seers in Scotland, to divine to me the portent of this singular happening! How very surprised *7 we all were when they landed—a body of armed men—and marched up, taking possession of the yard, and disarming our soldiers. The Major was in the house, and never mistrusted, I really believe, what could be their object, till they had seized the sloop and batteaux, and by their rapid movements in surrounding the men, put it out of his power to make any resistance. All this was, seemingly, the work of a moment. And before we had recovered from the first shock of the surprise, Mr. Selden, who appeared to be chief in command, had entered the house, and, with drawn sword, stood before us. The Major then, indeed, began to show some symptoms of uneasiness—more, however, even then, I thought, at the presence of one, whom he evidently has both feared and hated, since the former visit, than because he really supposed he was in earnest about capturing the establishment. After Mr. Selden had politely saluted us, ladios, he bowed formally to the Major, who returned the compliment only by a vain attempt to get his organs of speech in motion. `Who?—what?—Hem!' he stammered, stepping restlessly about the room, and looking daggers at the other: `Why, sir—I should like to know, sir—yes, sir—let me tell you, sir, what I think of you, sir'— `O, never trouble yourself, Major,' replied Mr. S. with a satirical smile, `it might take you a longer time than I could possibly spare to devote to so unimportant a purpose.' `Why, sir!' resumed my doughty warrior of a lady's parlour,—`d—n you, sir! do you mean to insult, sir?—I'll just let you know, sir—you'll just please to walk out of the house, sir!' `O, be patient, Major,' rejoined Selden, with the most provoking coolness. `Let me explain to these ladies the nature of our call, lest they be unnecessarily alarmed.' He then informed us of the outbreaking of the war, the capture of Ticonderoga—and the determination of the Americans to possess themselves of this post, also; and consequently the necessity of our removal to some other place, to which he assured us of a safe escort. `Now, Major,' said he, turning to the other, who had several times broken in on Mr. S., `I have only to say to you, that both you, and all your men are prisoners of war.' Even then the Major could scarcely comprehend what had befallen him; for he again began to bluster and threaten. But Selden, at once cutting him short, ordered him away; when they both left the house together. I never saw creatures so puzzled and confounded as were Marge and Merry Skene. They neither knew what to say, or how to act. As for myself, I could hardly hold in till the gentlemen had left the room, when I fairly shed tears with the laughter, which I could not repress, at the ludicrous scene I had witnessed. In regard to the valient Major, he will not, probably, make much more fuss about the affair to day. To-morrow he will be considerably moved at the disaster; and by the next day, he will have so collected his ideas and his wrath, that he will be tremendously mad. They took the place about noon;—since which we ladies have held our council of war. And it has been decided that we take our departure to-morrow morning for Albany, where we shall at present remain, with a connection of the Skenes'. I should have certainly preferred, for myself, to go and reside with you. But I dare not name it to them; for the girls are already as jealous of me as witches; and I well knew, that should I make such a proposition, it would be attributed to a secret wish to be where I could see more of Mr. S. And further, I am not quite sure, but they might be so kind as to communicate their suspicions to father; for I have a father, who may claim a voice in some matters as well as you. Now don't draw any inferences from that observation, Alma; because, positively, there are none to draw. Mr. Selden handed me your letter, brought by black Jack, till he fell into the hands of the powers that be. I read it with much interest,—the more so, perhaps, as I thought of the possibility that we may yet have cause to mingle our sympathies. I shall probably remain with the Skenes till father returns—if he does return; for now we have war, I am rather uncertain what course he will pursue. Should he receive a commission that suits him, he may engage in the war. This, however, is doubtful. And I think it very likely he will remain neutral, as I suspect he thinks the government have not done him justice. At all events, I don't believe he feels very bitter towards the Americans; but if he does, I know of one who don't. P. S. Mr. Selden is to escort us in person to Albany; and what is better, the Major is compelled to go with the other prisoners to Ticonderoga. His face is most unreasonably long at this arrangement— I think he will be crazy by to-morrow. Marge is secretly rejoiced, and I know of another who is less sad about it than she might be. I have had a conversation with Mr. Selden, alone, which has shown me that he can be serious when he pleases. But I have no time left me to state particulars. In my next I will be more explicit. Adieu, adieu. Jessy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “With pleasures, hopes, affections gone, The wretch may bear, and yet live on, Like things within the cold rock found Alive, when all's congeal'd around.” During the week succeeding the stirring and important events, which we have been endeavoring to describe, circumstances of both a public and private nature, conspired to bring Miss Hendee in contact with her neighbors and acquaintances, much more than usual. The recent change of masters at the fort having led to a new and frequent intercourse with the inhabitants of this section of the country, many of both sexes had called at the cottage, on their visits to their friends, who were now members of the garrison. Business connected with her father's household concerns had also caused her to make several calls, during the period above mentioned, at the houses of the different settlers in the neighborhood. It could not reasonably be supposed, in a country settlement where people, in the absence of other employment of their leisure, are usually so curious respecting the affairs of their neighbors, and where every kind of gossipping always finds so ready a circulation, that the visits of so distinguished a young gentleman as Warrington, at a house containing one so lovely and excellent as Alma Hendee, had been suffered to transpire without being generally known, and commented on, by the inhabitants of the vicinity. Such, at all events appeared not to have been the case in the present instance: for Miss Hendee soon discovered, that her social intercourse with her lover, as limited as it had recently been, was well understood by nearly every one of her acquaintance with whom she now happened to fall in company. And many were the jokes and banterings which she was compelled to meet on the subject. But there was one circumstance attending them which soon struck her as peculiar and uncommon in such kind of rallyings; and this was, that, instead of the flattering and grateful approvals, and happy predictions, usually uttered on such occasions, they were now, in almost every instance, accompanied with some manifestations of regret, or disapprobation, at the conjectured intimacy—some hesitation of manner, some ominous shaking of the head, or some mysterious hinting at the dangers that would attend the connection, which none, at the same time, seemed to treat as one that would terminate in marriage. At first, Alma paid but little attention to these intimations; but as they were repeated, they began to occasion her considerable uneasiness. And when she found them coming from all quarters, prudence would no longer permit her to pass them unheeded. And she began to busy her mind in trying to account for impressions, which she supposed to be much too general to be attributed to chance opinions, or personal prejudices. She felt satisfied that this feeling could not proceed from any wish to favor Sherwood's pretensions to her hand; for she well knew he was no favorite with the people at large. Nor could she perceive how it could arise from any ill opinion entertained against Warrington, who, as she had been told, was held in the highest estimation by the settlers generally, both for the signal services he had publicly rendered them, and for the many excellent traits of his private character. Although delicacy of feeling, as well as prudence, prevented her making any enquiries of those who had introduced this subject, yet the amount of what she had gathered from them seemed to indicate the existence of some insurmountable barrier to the union, to which she had recently engaged herself. But what the nature of this obstacle could be, she was wholly unable to conjecture. One day, after making one of her excursions among the settlers, she had returned home under an unusual depression of spirits, occasioned by some hints and warnings of a more pointed nature than she had before received, together with the mortifying reflection that her views and feelings, in regard to her secretly contemplated union, had found no response in the minds of her acquaintance. Although an easy credulity formed no part of the discriminating mind of Miss Hendee, yet prudence and discretion were ever among the leading traits of her finely balanced character. And these taught her the necessity of pausing in the path she had begun to tread, lest it, indeed, should be found to be beset with dangers, which had been concealed from her view. She recalled to mind some insinuations thrown out by Sherwood at his late visit, by which, she now, on reflection, supposed he intended she should believe, that Warrington was not only a libertine, but that he had, by a clandestine marriage, entered into with some of his victims for the purpose of accomplishing his designs, put it out of his own power to contract a legal marriage with another. Considering these insinuations at the time entirely false and malicious, she had instantly rejected them from her mind, withour paying attention enough to them to examine the import of the words by which they were conveyed. But now, on recurring to the subject, and comparing Sherwood's words with the dark hints she had since received from others, she could not but be startled with the coincidence she perceived in all the different intimations that she had heard. And the more she reflected on the various remarks of her acquaintance, all seeming to tend to the same point, and to be strangely corroborative of each other, the more apprehensive she became of the existence of some fact, which would not only level with the dust the fair fabric of prospective happiness she had lately been rearing, but would place her in no enviable position before the public, when the step she had taken should become known. While Miss Hendee was revolving these distracting thoughts in her mind, that had now reached that state of uncertainty and fluctuation which peculiarly fits it for the reception of questionable statements, her reflections were interrupted by the entrance of a man, who announced himself as a tinker, wishing to know whether there were any wares in the house which required the aid of his profession. Being answered in the affirmative, he pulled off his pack, and, producing his tools, went to work on such utensils as were brought him for repairing. He was a man of a loquacious turn; and he had scarcely become seated at his work, before his tongue was going as rapidly as his hammer. Being somewhat amused at the remarks she heard him make to Ruth, the domestic of whom we have before spoken, Alma soon acquitted the adjoining room, where she had seated herself, and, entering the kitchen, took a seat, and fell into conversation with the talkative stranger, occasionally asking a question herself, and good naturedly answering the various questions he put to her, as he rapidly roved from subject to subject, in so disconnected a manner, that it would have puzzled a philosopher to have traced the association of the man's ideas. `Your fort over here has lately changed masters, I learn,' he carelessly observed, after he had started and dispatched every other topic which he apparently could think of as connected with the affairs of the neighborhood,—`I wonder who has the command of the place under the new order of things?' `Major Warrington, I believe,' replied Alma, as a slight tinge overspread her fair cheek. `Major Warrington, Warrington, did you say?' said the man, enquiringly repeating the name: `not Charles Warrington of Bennington way?' `Yes, the same, sir,' replied the other. `Now I want to know! Do tell us if he has got to be Major?' half exclaimed, and half enquired the seemingly surprised tinker. `Is he a former acquaintance of yours, sir?' asked Alma, turning with a look of interest to the man. `Lord, yes!' exclaimed he, with great apparent simplicity. `Why mam, I have known him ever since he was knee high to a toad—used to live in the same town with him and his father's family, in old Connecticut, before they moved to the Grants, 8 and have seen Charles there often since, on his visits back among his relations—and—and old sweet-hearts,' he continued, looking up roguishly to Alma, as if to see how the last remark took with her, but perceiving the uneasiness of her looks, he jocosely added, `Why, I spose the girls know that the young men will have sweet-hearts, don't they?' `I pretend not to know young gentlemen's business, sir,' replied Alma, in a voice tremulous with suppressed emotion. `Well, well, I meant no offence,' rejoined the tinker, seemingly abashed at the poor reception of his rally. `You have given me none, sir,' timidly remarked the other. `But I think you said you had kept up your acquaintance with Mr. Warrington, and you may know whether—that is you'—and she paused, unable for the fluttering of her heart to proceed with an enquiry, the answer to which would probably involve her every hope of happiness for life: for she felt that this plain and apparently honest man, with his intimate knowledge of Warrington's previous life and character, would be able to furnish her testimony, which would remove her apprehensions, or confirm them, and seal her doom forever. `May know what, marm?' asked he, after waiting patiently awhile for her to proceed. Alma made an effort to go on; but so great was her agitation that she could not utter a syllable, and she remained silent. `Yes, I know all about Charles Warrington as well as any other man,' resumed the fellow, after he saw the other was not likely to go on with her enquiry. `A considerable of a chap he is, too. In fact, he is a plaguey smart fellow; and a likely one, too, in the main. I never knew but one mean trick about him in my life; and that was, shuffling off and deserting that poor simple wife of his, that he married kinder privately there in Connecticut a year or two ago.' Had a winged shaft from an Indian's bow, at that instant been driven through the heart of Alma Hendee, the convulsive start, the sudden contraction of the muscles of her face, and the fearful death-gasp, would have been scarcely more visible than was the effect of the words of the last speaker. She sat a moment as if suddenly paralyzed in all her senses. Presently commenced the twitching, nervous motion of her fingers, as she rapidly handled over the work in her lap. Then suddenly rising, she went to the window, and gasping for breath, stood an instant vacantly gazing out upon the landscape, with a face as white as the bloodless marble. She then turned quickly away, and, with hurried, unsteady steps, rushed out of the room. Reaching her own apartment, she again stopped short, and remained several moments mute and motionless as a statue, while the wo-stricken expression of her countenance, and the silent workings in the muscles of her blanched and beautiful features, as she stood, like a tearless Niobe, with her anguished eye upcast to heaven, and both hands pressed tightly against her heart, told, more forcibly than language can express, the mental agony with which she was contending. After Alma left the room, the miserable wretch, who had so cruelly inflicted this dreadful blow upon her feelings, hurried through his work, received his stipulated wages, and departed. No sooner had he turned his back than the faithful Ruth, who had noticed, and understood all that had passed, hastened, with looks of visible concern, to the apartment of her idolized young mistress. `Alma!' said she, tenderly placing her hand on the now burning brow of the suffering girl, who had flung herself upon her bed, where she was lying, with one hand pressing her closed eyelids and the other her side: `Alma, your forehead is very hot— shall I bathe it?' `No, no, Ruth,' faintly murmured the fair sufferer, `it is no attack of disease: my head, I know, is some fevered, and my eyes are sore, very sore; but the trouble is here!' she added, indicating the spot by lifting and replacing her hand upon her heart. `I was aware of your feelings in some measure, Alma,' replied the other soothingly, `and being like yourself, deceived in the character of the man of your secret choice, I confess, I did not disapprove of your partiality. But now, Alma, should you not be thankful, that you have made this discovery in season to retrace your steps, and escape the danger?' `Yes, and I am, I certainly am; but O, Ruth, Ruth, you little knew how much I loved him! and oh! how cruelly—cruelly has he repaid my lavished affection!' With this the sealed fountain of her tears suddenly opened. And as the pearly drops flowed thick and fast over her lovely cheeks, she breathed more freely; and the torture, the scorching, tearless agony, that she had felt withering both heart and brain, was removed, giving place to the mitigated suffering of ordinary sorrow, in which she long, long indulged, while her faithful domestic, in character of nurse and friend, watched over, and comforted her. The next morning, when Miss Hendee arose, she was calm and composed, though looking extremely pale. Her appearance very plainly told, that the struggle she had passed through had been a fearful one; but it told, also, that she had not struggled in vain for the mastery over her feelings. Though her heart had been pierced and lacerated, she seemed to have succeeded in silencing its throbbings. There was a decision in her looks and movements, that indicated the stern and unwavering resolves she had made. And in pursuance of the course she had marked out for herself, it was her first object to dispatch such a notice to Warrington of her determination, as should effectually deter him from attempting any renewal of the intercourse. Accordingly, after she had superintended, as usual, the household affairs of the family for the morning, she retired, and penned the brief note:— “Major Warrington,—Our intimacy is forever ended. As no explanations need be given, so none will be received. I trust, therefore, that no further communications on your part will be attempted. Alma Hendee.” Sealing the note, she summoned Neshobee to her room, and with the same desperate sort of calmness which she had exhibited through the morning, though with a slight tremor in her voice, she said to him, `Here, Neshobee, take this to Major Warrington without delay, if you can find him within twenty miles of this place. But I understand there was a vessel, with several boats filled with troops, arrived from the south last night; and he probably came with them, as he has been absent from the fort, I am told, for the purpose of enlisting more men. Go, give it 8* him; and do not stay an instant for an answer, or to give him a chance to question you.' The Indian, who perceived both in her words and manner, that some sudden change had taken place in the connection, which he was aware existed between her and his friend, Warrington, threw a keen enquiring glance upon the face of his mistress, and seemed to hesitate and linger, as if for an explanation of so unexpected an errand. But receiving only an impatient motion of her hand for his immediate departure, he turned away, and with an air of mingled wonder and regret, left the house in silence, and proceeding to his skiff at the landing, rowed directly over to the fort. When he arrived there he found all in bustle and commotion, preparatory to an expedition into Canada. Allen, Warrington and Arnold had arrived, as before intimated, the evening previous, with a schooner and a number of batteaux, filled with a considerable body of troops, collected for the contemplated expedition, all of whom were now on the point of embarking,—Arnold in the schooner, with such Massachusetts' troops as had arrived since the capture of Ticonderoga, and were now properly under his command, and Allen and Warrington with the remainder of the forces in the batteaux. As soon as the Indian reached the shore he sought out Warrington, and put the note into his hand. Receiving it as one who might be expecting a favor of the kind, the latter carefully put the supposed prize into his pocket, and informing the messenger, that he had one for him to take back to his mistress in return, he turned to finish the directions he was at the moment engaged in imparting to his men. When he had completed the business immediately on hand, he turned to look for Neshobee, that he might take him into the fort to receive the letter he intended to send back by him. But, after searching for him in vain among the men, he cast his eye on to the lake, and, to his surprise and vexation, he beheld the native rapidly pulling for the opposite shore, and already out of hailing distance. Still supposing, however, that the messenger had misunderstood his request, the impatient lover hastened to a solitary room in the fort for the purpose of reading the precious paper alone, and adding a postscript to the one he had written, that he might dispatch it by a special messenger before he embarked. As soon as he was alone, he eagerly broke the seal of Alma's brief note, and read, with the most unmingled pain and astonishment, its unexpected contents. Hastily rising from the seat he had taken, he, for many minutes rapidly paced the room in silence, while the agitation visibly depicted on his manly countenance plainly bespoke the depth and bitterness of his emotions. `Yes, noble girl,' he at length mournfully said, `incapable of intrigue and meanness yourself, you have, in some way, unsuspectingly become a victim to the snares of a villain! It is—it must be so. A deception has been practiced upon you—a gross deception could alone have prompted to a measure so sudden, so cruel, so inconsistent, and so destructive, as I know it must be, to your own happiness. Well, well, I have no leisure now, if I would, to enter the lists with this dispicable plotter of mischief, who has thus entered our Eden, and turned its happiness to sorrow, in trying to ferret out his villanies, or compete with him in his low game of intrigue and deception. I must leave you, too credulous girl, to discover for yourself the arts by which you have been duped, and the injustice you have done me— till then, farewell—till then, be my country my heart's only mistress.' Before another hour had elapsed, Warrington had embarked with his troops, and, with the gallant and war-like array with which he was borne down the lake, had passed from the scene of his love and disappointment on his way to fields of blood and glory. It comes not within the scope of our design to accompany our Green Mountain Boys through the eventful campaign that followed their present embarcation, or to attempt to trace the varied fortunes of their gallant leaders,—the daring, talented, and chivalrous Allen, who, in his heroic attempt on Montreal, was taken prisoner and carried to England in irons, and there kept through a long and doleful captivity, which deprived his country of the aid of one of her most energetic sons during the most trying period of the war,—the skillful, cool and intrepid Warrington, whose conduct soon won for him the admiration of his country,—the gay and gifted Selden, whose sword and pen were alike successfully wielded in the cause,—and the jolly and fearless Jones, who became known as the most sagacious and trusty scout leader in the northern army. These, and the brave, resolute and patriotic men under their command, who soon, by their courage and success in battle, and their fidelity to the cause of freedom, rendered the name of Green Mountain Boys a terror to their foes, and an appellation of honor among their admiring countrymen, we must now leave to struggle with their enemies abroad, while we remain on the spot we have chosen as the scene of our story, there to wait their return to make the place once more the theatre of glorious conflict. From this time, for a period of about two years, there was a pause in the action of our story. Although the events which formed its commencement were intimately connected with those attending its catastrophe, yet nothing occurred, during that interval, particularly to vary the aspect of the one, or to hasten the other. And the relative situation of all the different individuals of our “dramatis personæ,” from this time seperated and scattered in various directions, remained nearly unaltered, till the tide of war, combined with other circumstances, brought them again together to figure on the scene of action where we have thus far described them. We propose, therefore, to pass lightly over this interval, and with a few observations, by way of noticing the situation and progress of affairs in the Hendee family in the meanwhile, we shall proceed at once to the closing period of our story. From the hour of her supposed discovery of the duplicity and base conduct of Warrington, life was but a joyless blank to Alma Hendee. Although by the fortitude and firmness of her character, aided by female pride, which had been deeply wounded by the mortifying developement, she had succeeded in her determined efforts to keep from sinking under the cruel disappointment, yet she could not but feel, that the young affections, which she had thus lucklessly suffered to entwine round the heart, and root themselves in its very core, were withered, never to be revived to their original freshness at the bidding of another. In the unbounded confidence of her youthful love, she had squandered her heart's best treasures on one from whom neither pride nor principle would longer suffer her to accept a return. And she was deeply conscious, that she could never gather them again, to bestow them on a more worthy object, or where they would yield her the earthly happiness to which she had begun to look so fondly forward in her anticipated connection. It is an interesting and beautiful trait in the character of woman's affections, that she never truly worships but at one altar. If that remains to her, though no new attraction be added,—no new inducement offered to ensure the continuance of her devotion,—she asks no more, but worships on, and on, more deeply and fervently, till the heart, that offers the homage, ceases in death to cling to all earthly objects. But if that is destroyed or removed, the incense of her heart passes away with it. She may, indeed, sometimes be found kneeling at another shrine, and offering up the forms of devotion, but the life, the spirit of the worship is forever gone. After the rupture between Miss Hendee and Warrington, Sherwood became, for a while, unusually constant in his visits at Captain Hendee's, and quite assiduous in his attentions to the listless girl, to whom they were offered. At his first call, after that event, he soon, and with a malicious satisfaction, discovered that the arts he had put in practice had been crowned with success. This he not only read in her pale face, in which the settled air of gloom and disappointment were visibly depicted, but also in her altered, and more respectful manner towards himself, which, without any change of opinion respecting his general character, she very naturally, though unconsciously, perhaps, exhibited towards him, as to one whom she now exhonerated from the particular charges to which she believed him obnoxious. Having satisfied himself of this state of things, he at first cunningly forbore to renew his former pretensions to her hand. In a short time, however, he began again to make professions of attachment, and, without asking of her any other than the tacit acquiesence she had formerly yielded, talked of their engagement as of a settled business, and as if nothing had occurred to alter the relation formerly existing between them. These addresses Alma rather suffered than received; and the affair between them was, in this manner, allowed by her to fall into much the same train in which it was moving on Warrington's appearance. And yet she still had but little thought of uniting her destinies with those of Sherwood; but continuing to hope that something would eventually occur to save her from the dreaded fate, she permitted the affair to glide along as she had formerly done, solely out of regard to the feelings of her father and the interests of the family. And, indeed, now, more than ever, did it seem necessary, that the family should avoid a rupture with Sherwood, as they were becoming more and more dependent on his assistance. With the breaking out of the revolution, the half pay which Captain Hendee had before regularly received, and which had constituted his main dependence, ceased to be transmitted. And he was therefore driven to avail himself, from time to time, of the offers of Sherwood to loan him money to meet his exigencies. In this manner Miss Hendee wore away about two years of her dull and joyless existence, finding nothing in the present to console or cheer her desponding mind, and seeing nothing but clouds and darkness in the future; when an incident occurred that threw a new light upon her dark and cheerless path, and produced a revolution in her whole views and feelings, as sudden and complete, as the event which caused it was singular and unexpected.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “A sudden joy lights up my loneliness.” It was a soft and balmy evening, in that loveliest of all months of the year in our northern clime, delightful June, when two ladies were seen issuing from the Hendee cottage, to wander abroad, to enjoy the beauties of the evening, and hold, in the solitudes of the fields, that confidential communion on subjects of mutual concern, which is ever so interesting to friends, who have just met after a long separation. One was in height something above the ordinary standard of women, but with a form as faultless as the chisselled marble. Her carriage and general demeanor, though easy and graceful, were yet not of that light and joyous kind, which generally bespeaks corresponding lightness of heart, but were marked, rather, by that serious, drooping east, that tells of secret cares and sorrows; while an air of deep and pensive thoughtfulness rested in her dark blue eyes, and overspread her somewhat pale, though exquisitely moulded features. The other female was a trifle smaller, and as volatile as a child in her movements. The very reverse of her companion, she seemed to be the creature of joyous impulses. Though both possessed far more than an ordinary share of personal beauty, yet their beauty was of an entirely different order: for while the appearance of the former was calm, intellectual and commanding, that of the latter was sprite-like and playful, partaking largely of that certain prettiness, that eccentric, will o' wisp sort of witchery, which men generally pursue eagerly rather than worship profoundly. They were both old acquaintances of the reader, and we will, therefore, allow them to announce themselves by the conversation that now ensued between them. `Now tell me, Alma,' said the smaller girl, `for, in spite of all the dogged silence you have shown in your letters on the subject, I determined I would know the first time I saw you—tell me, I say, what was the true reason of your dismissing Warrington?' `There are some things, Jessy,' replied the other, `which involve such imputations on our own prudence and discernment, and are, of themselves, so humiliating to our feelings, that we can hardly bring ourselves even in thought to recur to them,—much less to reveal them to others. And this is the main reason why I have never apprised you of the fact you seek to know.' `Yes, but I shall not let you off on such a reason, you may depend upon it. Come, come, girl, I will be your confessor, and the more crossing to your feelings the confession, why the more it will be for your good, if the Catholic priests are in the right of it.' `No, Jessy, let us forget the subject: I would not again disturb my feelings by recalling to mind the man who once caused me so much sorrow. It is 9 enough to say that I was grossly deceived in his character.' `Deceived! How deceived?—now I tell you, Alma Hendee, I will know, and, as I am to live with you till father returns from England, I will thorn you night and day, till you tell me.' `Well, then, Jessy, if you must know, the cause of my discarding him was the best of all causes; because he could never be lawfully mine: for, wherever his heart may have been, his hand belonged to another. And while he was vowing his heart to me, he was the husband of a living wife in Connecticut. What say you to a deception like that, Jessy?' `Why, monster!—if so—but how know you that fact, Alma?' `I received intimations of it from various sources, which I disbelieved, when a man called here who was well acquainted with Warrington's whole career, and he confirmed all that I had heard.' `Warrington—the high-minded, and brave Colonel Warrington, guilty of baseness like that?—impossible! Are you quite sure that there is not some mistake, or some intended deception, about this, Alma?' `Yes, yes,—think not that, with my unbounded confidence in the man, I should have been brought to believe this easily. And Oh! if you knew what the discovery cost me!' `But did you apprise him of this discovery?' `No!' `Why?' `Simply, because, as I was fully satisfied of the fact, all attempted explanations would not only fail to mend the matter, but make it worse, by continuing a correspondence which would be ruinous to me, and disgraceful to us both.' `Alma Hendee, I can hardly believe this strange story. I fear you have been deceived. I wish I had known it before. Neither Colonel Warrington, nor Captain Selden, have the least idea that such were your reasons for the sudden, and, to them, unaccountable step you took. I have conversed with them both on the subject; and they both believe, I imagine, that you were either coerced by your father, or were laboring under some misapprehension. Mr. Selden, I know, believes this; and he told me on our way here, that if you would keep yourself from becoming entangled with Sherwood, the affair might yet be reconciled between you and the Colonel, who yet cherishes for you all his former sentiments.' `It never will be reconciled, however, Jessy.' `Why, you have not seriously determined to marry Sherwood, have you?' `I can hardly bring myself, I own, to think seriously of such a sacrifice,' said Alma, mournfully. `I certainly never should harbor the thought a moment, if I had now any other object to live for, than to render my infirm and embarrassed father as happy as possible. This I see but one way of doing. And as my own hopes of happiness are gone, should it not now be my duty to attend to his in the only way I can accomplish it? At best it is but a dark and dreary prospect that lies before me, Jessy. And let us turn from it now to your own, which has at least hope to brighten it.' `Yes, hope, faith and resolution, come what will, except such a damper as you received. By the way, Alma, did not you think that your father was a good deal taken with Selden for so brief an acquaintance as his short stay with us to day afforded?' `I did, indeed, and with great pleasure, notice it. And well my father might be pleased with him; for I now know no gentleman whom I'— `Take care! take care!' briskly interrupted the vivacious Jessy. `Be cautious how far you proceed with your praises, Miss!' `I will be moderate rather than alarm you, then,' replied Alma, smiling. `Well, see that you are; or I'll be jealous as sure as you live. Besides, I don't care a fig about obtaining your praises for him. But Captain Hendee's good opinion of him is a point gained with me; for my father, you know, has placed me, and my destinies, too, for aught I know, in the Captain's hands for the present. I wish I could get a peep at that letter of instructions, as I suppose it was, which I brought from my father to yours. What cautious old things these papas are about us girls, are they not, now?' `Your father, then, suspects your attachment— does he?' `Why, that is what I am myself puzzled to decide. Selden contrived right cunningly to get introduced to my father, soon after the old gentleman arrived at Albany, where the Green Mountain troops, with their officers, have been posted the past season, you know. They have since met several times, and by the fact of my being entrusted to Selden's care in coming on here, I know father considers him a man of honor at least. But whether he has ever suspected the truth about us, I have been wholly unable to ascertain. If he has, and disapproves it, he has studied out some sly, indirect way of breaking up the connection, without recourse to open opposition, which, I have often heard him say, made ten matches where it broke one.' `But did not Major Skene, after his exchange and return, or his sisters, inform Colonel Reed of their suspicion, most probably?' `They would have done so, perhaps, had they continued as jealous as at first, but since my engagement with Selden we have both acted in concert to blind them, and I think they are in the dark themselves.' `And how have you disposed of the Major, in the meanwhile?' `I laughed him out of countenance—jeered and joked him about his valor at Skenesboro' before the officers, ridiculed him in every way I could devise, till at last the fellow became so sore under the torment, that he fairly avoided me, as if I had been a viper, and that is the way I advise you to take with your eternal hanger on, who, like the Major, was never man enough to cease his attentions when he knew they were not agreeable. But where is Sherwood now?' `We don't know. He has been absent several weeks. He told us he was going to Albany. You heard nothing of him there, did you?' `No! but if he was there, he would hardly show himself in public, I think. Did you know they strongly suspected him of being a tory?' `I knew not that he was suspected by others. But from his standing aloof from the contest, when our bleeding country required the aid of every friend, from the character of his associates, and among the rest that despicable Darrow, and more especially from one or two secret journeys, which I feel satisfied he *9 has lately made into Canada, I have for sometime known that he was any thing but an American patriot.' By this time our fair friends, having wandered down the slope towards the lake, had reached the shore, and seated themselves on a little grassy elevation near the landing, where they were about to resume their conversation, when a skiff, containing three men, whose approach from the south had been screened from their sight by intervening bushes, made its appearance, and put in for the shore. The girls instantly arose, and were hastily retiring, when they were hailed by the leader of the party, after he had risen in his boat, and looked intently a moment at those on shore. On turning round, Alma at once recognized him to be the tall woodsman, with whom she first became acquainted as the messenger of Warrington. `If you'll agree not to be scart much at such a beauty as I be, gals,' said Pete, leaping ashore and striding up the bank, `I should like well enough to have one of you stop running away long enough to have me tell you what one of you wants, that is if I havn't forgot the face that used to belong to her.' Jones, now advancing to the spot from which the girls, with hesitating steps, were slowly retreating, pulled out a soiled and crumpled letter, and offered it to Alma. But the latter, supposing it to be from Warrington, shook her head, and declined receiving it. `Well, now!' said the scout, a little disconcerted at the unexpected refusal: `by hoky! if this an't the first time I ever knew a body that wouldn't take a letter that belonged to 'em! Well, I've done all that the fellow, who asked me to bring it, could expect of me, I consider.' `From whom did you receive the letter, sir?' asked Jessy, who easily apprehended the reasons of her friend for declining to receive it. `Well, now, marm,' replied Jones, scratching his head, `that is asking a notch more than I am very well able to answer. I partly hinted to the man to tell me his name, but he kinder screwed round in his talk so that he kept clear of telling me. Howsomever, it was an honest looking fellow enough, that I fell in with at Skenesboro,' where we stopped for breakfast, this morning.' `O, it is not from any in the army, then,' rejoined Jessy, throwing a significant look at her companion, intended to convey a sly joke for her over cautiousness. `Any in the army?' said Jones, repeating the words of the other, as he began to assume his old comic twist of features, `no, unless you might call him a kettle drummer; for now I think on't when we first came into the house where we found him, he was at it hammer and tongs upon an old brass kettle, making clatter enough to crazy a small nation.' `I beg your pardon, Mr. Jones,' said Alma, courteously, `I was under a misapprehension in regard to the source of this letter—I will receive it now; sir, if you please; and thank you kindly for your trouble in bringing it,' she added, extending her hand and taking the proffered paper. `Are you direct from Albany, sir?' asked Miss Reed, preparatory to some other question, apparently. `We started from there about twelve last night, and in a bit of a hurry, too,' replied the scout, turning and looking upon the face of his fair interrogator, whom he now for the first time seemed to recognize. `Why, now, if I an't beat, to find that queer fighting bird again—beg pardon, marm—I didn't mean it for offence; for I don't calculate to be very sarcy to folks, excepting to the Britishers. And I kinder guess you an't very stiff for that side after all, or you wouldn't allow yourself to be caught by the Green Mountain Boys so easy and often.' It was Jessy's turn to be disconcerted now, and blushing to the very temples, she turned confusedly away, and pretended to be looking for wild strawberries in the grass, while Alma, smiling to see the discomfiture of her friend at the honest but sly hit involved in the remark of the woodsman, now addressing the latter, asked, `Has any late intelligence of the enemy's movements been received at head quarters, that has caused you to be dispatched in this direction so hastily?' `I rather expect there has, marm.' `Any threatened invasion? I know there have been fears of one, from Canada, but hearing nothing of it lately, we had begun to believe it a false rumour.' After looking Alma earnestly in the face an instant, Jones motioned her to step a little further from her companion, when in a low tone he observed to her, `You used to be true blue—I wonder if you are now?' `If you mean a friend to your cause, who can be trusted, you may count me as one.' `I rather thought so—well, we fear there will be hot work in this quarter in a very few days from this. A British deserter, who was taken up over on Winooski River, and sent on by Captain Baker, arrived at head quarters yesterday, and gave us the information that General Burgoyne with an army of ten thousand men has already reached St. Johns on his way through this settlement to Albany, if he can get there. Colonel Warrington and his regiment of Green Mountain Boys were to march this morning to reinforce St. Clair at Ticonderoga. And General Schuyler's whole army, before this, are on the move for Fort Edward, as the place where the grand tussle is to be had, if the enemy are not stopped before. I, and my scouts in the boat there, are now on our way to reconnoiter, and watch the progress of the Reglars as they come on. Now, this last part of it you must keep dark about to all where there is the least chance of its getting into the wind. If I get along back as far as here, I will try to call, and let you and the folks in this quarter know when the enemy may be expected, that you may all be out of the way before they arrive. But I must be off; for we must row ten good miles further to-night, before we encamp. Good nighty, marm.' Having given this exciting piece of information, imparted with more seriousness and directness of manner, than any thing of equal length he had uttered, perhaps, for years, Jones turned on his heel, bounded forward to the shore, and leaped into the boat, which the next instant shot by the landing and disappeared. Knowing that the scout's secret would be as safe with her companion as with herself, Alma immediately called her, and repeated the startling news she had just received. And the solicitude and trembling apprehensions which filled the bosom of each, as they thought of their respective friends in connection with the approaching danger, for awhile swallowed up every other feeling. Even the letter, the delivery of which had occasioned the call of the scouts, was forgotten, till the girls had retraced their steps more than half the distance to the house. It being then recalled, however, Miss Hendee seated herself on a hillock, opened and began reading it, with an air of listlesss curiosity, which showed how little she expected to be interested in its contents, while Jessy knelt before her on the grass, watching the varying expressions, from simple curiosity to eager interest, and from that to deep emotion, which successively passed over the countenance of the other as she proceeded in the perusal. The letter was without signature, and ran thus: “Miss Hendee, I guess, will remember, how, a year or two ago, a man came to your house and mended the things; and how he made some statements about Charles Warrington, the Colonel that now is. Now, what I said at that time has worried my feelings a great deal most ever since. Though I then really thought what I said was justifiable, even if it was not quite true, as I was made to believe it to be for your good. But I soon after found out what I told you was not so, for I didn't know myself, and only said what I was asked to say. This was the story of it. As I was going from house to house, working at my trade there in your part of the settlement, I fell in with a plausible sort of a man,— I don't think I had best call him by name,—and we after a while got to talking about Warrington, whom I had seen often enough, though I knew nothing about his private affairs. Well, he, in a smooth kind of way, said there was one thing that hurt his feelings; and that was, that Warrington was doing the wrong thing by a relative of his, a very likely girl, that he pretended to be courting for the sake of getting her family on his side in the York quarrel, when to his certain knowledge, he had a young wife that he had deserted down country. He said it was a great pity to have the girl so deceived, and he would give two gold guineas to any one who would break up the courtship. But he said it would do no kinder good for her relations to try; and they were very anxious some one else should undertake to do it. He then told me his plan was, that he and I, if I would agree to do it, should first kinder secretly tell folks this story about the deserted wife, so that it should get to her, and make her begin to believe it; and then I should go there and pretend to come from where Warrington used to live, and let drop some how, before the girl, that I was knowing myself to that business about his being married. Well, he kinder drew me into this plan, and I being poor, consented for the money to do as I did. But I soon mistrusted that this man had some wrong design, which I found out to be the case, and I feel very sorry, and ask pardon for what happened; and shall feel very bad if I done any mischief by it, as I think Colonel Warrington a very likely man. I think I shall feel easier now in my mind, but I guess, considering, I shant sign my name, though I am not ashamed of it, or at least I never was in any other affair since I was born. Your well wisher to serve.” The first feeling that pervaded the bosom of Miss Hendee, on reading this humble epistle, the truth and genuineness of which she found it impossible to doubt, was that of unmingled indignation at the base and detestable conduct of the man who had instigated the deception that had been practiced upon her with such complete success. The whole of that transaction, together with all the dark hints and warnings she had previously received from her acquaintance, now stood explained before her. She found no difficulty in tracing all to the same source, and she saw at once the motives which had actuated the subtle author of this piece of refined villany in the course he had pursued. Her next feeling was that of deep and unfeigned regret, for the injustice she had unintentionally done one, whom, but for this erroneous belief, she would have held, of all on earth, the most dear and honored. At last came the heart's rich gushings of returning love. And from the overpowering force of these mingled emotions, she sat down and wept like a child.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “And how felt he, the wretched man Reclining there—while memory ran O'er many a year of guilt and strife, Flew o'er the dark flood of his life, Nor found one sunny resting place, Nor brought him back one branch of grace!” In the environs of Albany, at the period of which we are writing, stood an ancient looking tenement, originally designed, as its general appearance indicated, for a common farm house; though the grounds around it seemed lately to have been left almost wholly uncultivated; while dilapidated fences, and an unchecked growth of rank weeds, springing up every where about the premises, told any thing but of good husbandry in the occupant. Indeed, there was an air of solitude and decay about the place, which might reasonably have been taken by all as an evidence of a corresponding decay in the circumstances of the owner, but for the fact known to many, that he had brought large sums of money, which he must have increased, as he had ever lived on an economical scale, and husbanded his treasures with the most miserly care,—ever speculating upon the necessities of others, and loaning his money at exhorbitant usury. Since the commencement of the unsettled times of the revolution, however, he had been busily engaged in drawing in his funds, while he began to talk of pretended losses, and to feign the appearance of approaching poverty, by suffering his farm to run to waste, as if through inability to bestow upon it a proper cultivation. This was attributed by many to actual impoverishment; but those who knew more of his affairs, set it down at once to his unwillingness to trust out his property in such fluctuating times, and his fears of being compelled to loan, or otherwise part with it, for maintaining the American cause, to which, it was suspected, he was not over friendly. He had ever been a man of few friends, and still fewer confidants. And for the last year or two, he had almost wholly withdrawn himself from society; while, as was noticed by those who occasionally saw him, his health appeared to be gradually undermining, and his countenance wore an air of deep dejection, arising, it was surmised, as 10 he had no visible grounds of sorrow, from remorse of conscience, or other mental inquietudes, the causes of which he had never divulged. To this cheerless spot we would now invite the reader for the purpose of introducing one to whom allusion has been several times made, the father of Jacob Sherwood. The unhappy old man had been for several weeks rapidly failing, and he now lay stretched on the bed of sickness, with the full consciousness, that the end of his earthly career was fast approaching; while a retrospect of his life began to fill his mind with terror and alarm, in view of the retribution which his guilt-stricken conscience told him was at hand. Although, by the constant exercise of that peculiar cunning and cautiousness, which were leading traits in his character, he had always contrived to stear clear of the penalties of the law, yet there had been certain secret passages in his life, the memory of which now turned his dying bed into a couch of thorns, and drove him to think of making some atonement for the injuries he had inflicted before he dare go to his final account. With this, among other views, he had, the week previous, sent a special messenger for his son, and he was now anxiously looking for his arrival. But the lingering days passed on, and he came not, till the wretched invalid, warned by his failing strength, that he could hold out but a few days longer, dared no more delay the act of justice, which his guilty fears had urged him to perform, to those who had been the victims of secret villanies. But let us now enter his gloomy abode, and proceed to his bed-side. He had been lying about an hour in a troubled sleep, from which he had several times suddenly started up, with a wild, apprehensive glare, and a few incoherent mutterings, that gradually died away on his working lips, as he relapsed into his uneasy slumbers. He now, however, became thoroughly awakened, and, turning his face to the nurse in attendance, a wrinkled old crone, who, with an ignorant, clownish looking boy, made up the rest of the family at the present time, he eagerly enquired if his son had arrived. And being answered in the negative, he sunk back on his pillow with a look of blended wo and disappointment, which told the utter wretchedness of his feelings. `O, when will he come! when will he come!' at length muttered to himself the hapless old man. `I shall die before he arrives! no, no, I must not die, I cannot die, till I see him—till he promises. But if he should not come! Or if he come and would not promise, or promising, would not perform, where would be the reparation? I fear—I fear him, with so much interest at stake! Oh! why have I delayed this so long! Why have I carried this dreadful weight till now! If I had but strength to write it! —perhaps I have—I will try—I will! Nabby?' he continued, calling to the deaf old woman, `I say, Nabby! bring me here pen and paper.' `Eh? O, ay!' replied the crone, bringing the required implements. `Now bolster me up on the bed, and lay that old ledger open on the bed-clothes before me. There! that will do.' Having been a ready penman, and deriving a temporary strength from the excitement of his sudden resolution, the invalid succeeded in writing out a brief statement, or confession, of the misdeeds which laid heaviest on his troubled conscience. `There! there!' he exclaimed in a sort of unnatural glee, `it is on paper! it is down—thank God it is down! I feel easier now—relieved—some of the poison has passed from my heart to the paper;' and he read over, and continued looking some time upon the lines, with a wild, exulting satisfaction, muttering at intervals, `yes, thank God, it is down!' He then, having again called the nurse, and directed her to seal the paper securely, superscribed it to Captain James Hendee, giving the woman strict orders to give it to his son when he arrived, or to some other person, who would promise to deliver it to the person to whom it was addressed. After this, he fell back exhausted, and lay some time in silent meditation. `Yes, that is something,' he said, at length, resuming his soliloquy; `but will it bring back the lost, or dead? No! Will it restore the property I took from them? No, not a shilling without a suit, and then Jake will find some way to defeat it—and then the letter may be lost—he may mistrust what I have written and destroy it. It won't do—I must make a will and place it out of his hands—I must, O, I must—and I will do it—I will do it, now. Ezra! Ezra!' he continued, speaking with nervous rapidity. `Nabby! tell Ezra to come here in a minute!' The ill-clothed, and more ill-favored, boy soon made his appearance. `Ezra, you go over to Esquire Vanderpools, and tell him I want he should come here as quick as possible—run! run!' The man, who was thus summoned, and who was an attorney, whom the old gentleman had sometimes employed, and consulted, on account of the prudence and secrecy with which he conducted all matters submitted to his charge, in a short time entered the apartment, and quietly seated himself by the bed-side of the sick man. The old nurse was then ordered to leave the room. `I am going to die, Squire,' said the old man feebly. `I hope not,' replied the attorney, casting a scrutinizing glance at the pallid face of the other, but without betraying the least emotion. `I know best, and I have thoughts of making a will—can you draw one that will hold?' `None of my making have ever yet failed.' `So I suppose, and I believe you honest, and to have a mind of your own, or I should not have sent for you. But can it all be kept secret till the will is proved in court?' `Who is to be executor?' `I have been thinking of that. So much money is a great trust, but if you are not honest, who is? I must have you.' `All can be managed, then.' `Yes, but will it be done? will you promise? I have reasons—you know Jacob—will you not let him buy you up?' `Never!' `Write me a will then; and be quick,—quick— bequeathing a thousand pounds to Captain James Hendee of the New Hampshire Grants, and all he now owes me—another thousand to his daughter. That will make them good for what I'— `That is right! make a clean breast of it, Mr. Sherwood,' observed the attorney, encouragingly. `I will—God forgive me for taking that amount from the property left with me to manage. Put it down in the will “reparation.” `I will. But the rest of the property?' 10* `All to my son—write on—be quick.' `The attorney, with an acquiescing nod, proceeded diligently with his task, while the restless invalid again muttered to himself, `It will be an inducement for Jake to marry the girl, which I fear he means to avoid. But he probably will do it now, and then nothing will be lost by this; and if he don't, why, he has enough without it. Yes, this will do. I shall feel better—better.' The will was very soon completed, witnesses were called, all the requisite formalities passed through; when, after receiving from the testator many additional injunctions, the attorney departed with the important instrument in his pocket. As soon as this business, for which the sick man had summoned all his failing energies, was accomplished, he again became as helpless as an infant, and lay several hours in a state of exhaustion and stupor. At length his malady began to assume a different and more threatening aspect. The pains of approaching dissolution set in, attended with mental anguish, even more fearful in appearance than his bodily agony; and to the wretched old man a night of horrors succeeded. While his limbs were writhing with pain, and he seemed to be grappling in bodily effort with the king of terrors, the most fearful images appeared to rise continually before his distracted mind, to complete the horrors of his situation. At one time he seemed to be contending with desperate fierceness against troops of fiends, that stood palpably before him, reaching out their long, skinless claws to drag him from his bed, while, “keep them off! Oh, keep them off,” would burst in the accents of despair from his lips. At another time, the images of those he had injured appeared to rise upon his troubled fancy, and stand before him, giving, even by their quiet presence, unspeakable tortures to his feelings. `Leave me, Brother Hendee, O, leave me!' he would piteously exclaim, waving his hand for the other, whom he fancied to be standing by his bed-side, to depart. `Away! away! I cannot look on you. You forgive me? what is that to me, so long as that great burning eye is looking down so fiercely upon me? Oh! don't smile upon me! don't, Brother Hendee! It stings—it kills me! There! that is right—kind. He is gone now. But what is that coming? Oh! what is that?' he continued, starting up with a look replete with horror and distress: `see, how he reaches out his little hands as they carry him off into the woods, crying uncle, save me, uncle, from the Indians! It is a lie! I say I am not your uncle! You are an imp!—a fiend, come to torment me! There! I told you so—I knew it—see! see, there! he is sending that troop of devils to drag me down into that dreadful black gulph! Oh! God! they have seized me! I won't! I won't go! help! murder! Oh! help! help!' and with the expiring efforts of his delirious energies, he rose up in his bed, and throwing his arms wildly above him, and uttering a fearful screech, he fell down on his face, and the next moment was a livid corpse! Such was the fearful end of John Sherwood, who, with no penitence that could be acceptable in the sight of Heaven, thus thought to conpound with his conscience, and atone for his misdeeds by offering up a portion of that wealth which he had made the only idol of his worship through life—a life marked, indeed, with many acts of specious kindness, performed towards those he had wronged, but always performed on the principle we have mentioned, or to veil the secret injuries he had inflicted, from the eyes of his victims, and blind the public to his true character. On the second day after the event just dercribed, and but a few hours before the time appointed for the funeral ceremonies, Jacob Sherwood rode into the yard, and without any previous intimation of his father's death, entered the house. `How is the old gentleman, Nabby?' he asked, approaching and putting his mouth close to the ear of the deaf old domestic. `Eh? O,—why, don't ye know? Han't they told you how he is dead?' `No! shocking!—Why, when did he die?' `Yester night—jest fore day. Desput sick, the old gentleman was that night. And he was in a terrible taking to see you, Mister Jacob, fore he died.' `What did he wish to see me for in particular, do you know?' `No—not sartainly. But he was under some consarn of mind, I reckon. It was malagantly to hear him take on, and see him act. O, 'twas dreadful times with us that night: I, and Ezra sot up. I hope the old gentleman never done any thing that was wrong.' `Ezra, what did he say?' asked Sherwood, eagerly turning to the boy, who was present. `O, he talked drefful bad and scary bout somfing carrying him off. I'se mortal feared, and went behind the door.' `Nabby—say Nabby!' said the former, again addressing the old woman, `who has been here since father was taken sick, besides the doctor?' `Doctor! he wouldn't have no doctor—he took his own physics.' `Who, then, has been here?' `Why, none but old Mrs. Chandler, to tell me about fixing his gruel and things, except the folks that come to lay him out, and Squire Vanderpool, the day fore he died, and then the next morning, to carry off the papers and chests.' `Vanderpool! papers and chests! what can all that mean?' said Sherwood, in an undertone, and with an air of concern. `But, say, old woman, what did Squire Vanderpool and father do, when they were together?' `Don't know nothing no way about it; cause they sent me out—may be about some writings. La! now, I forgot the letter,' added the woman, jumping up and bringing the letter the deceased had entrusted to her charge: `there, he told me to make you promise to give this to Captain Hendee.' `Certainly—I promise,' said Sherwood, seizing the letter and putting it in his pocket. After a few more enquiries, Sherwood retired to another room, when, taking out the letter and carefully breaking it open, so that it might be re-sealed, if he saw fit to suffer it to go to its destination, he proceeded to read it; after which he rose, took out a pocket pistol, drew the charge, went to the fire place, and flashed the priming against the letter, which he held between his thumb and finger till it was entirely consumed. `Well,' said he to himself, as he replaced his pistol, that piece of evidence is at rest, I think, and if all other matters can be managed as easily, all will be well. But it is very evident that the old man has been making a will; and Vanderpool, who must be executor, I imagine, by his presuming to carry off the papers and money, is a hard customer to manage, I confess; though it must be done by some means or other,—that is, if the old man's weakness and silly fears have led him to make any serious inroad on my prospects. And who knows how far he may have gone—devil! if he has been willing away my property! But that he could not do. He could only dispose of his own, the lesser half I think it must be. Well, that is mine, too; and I won't go it. So, if he has been willing it away, curse me, if I don't find a way to suppress or break the will. Let's see,—Vanderpool is rather poor. That is lucky; for a cool hundred is something of a tempter. But if that fails, then here are the deaf old haddock of a woman and the doltish boy, ready with their humbug stories to swear the old man insane at the time. Good! I'll make it traverse some how. But the first thing is to see Vanderpool; and I may as well do it now. No, I forgot,—the time of the funeral is at hand, and I must be rigging up, and putting on a sorrowful face—sorrowful! as if it was a matter of special grief to come into possession of a clear ten thousand!' Thus soliloquizing, and settling his plans for repairing the rent which he feared his father had made in his fortunes, the heartless heir dressed himself, and joined the domestics and others, who had now come in to assist in making arrangements for the approaching obliquies. These being made, and the hour appointed for the funeral, now arriving, the ceremonies were performed by a small train of the nearest neighbors, including his executor, and one or two other individuals from the city, who had sustained some connection with the deceased in business transactions. Though the demeanour of all present was marked with the decency and sobriety natural on the occasion, yet none of that emotion, which the ties of heartfelt friendship, severed by death, usually produces at such times, was visible among the company. Not a sigh was heard, not a tear was seen to bedew a single cheek, as they followed the old man, who had never exhibited any feelings in common with them, unwept and unhonored, to his long home. That evening, and as early as he thought decency would permit, after his father's remains were consigned to the earth, Sherwood repaired to Vanderpool's office. And, after what he deemed would be considered some suitable observations upon his recent bereavement, he carelessly remarked, `My father made a will in his last sickness, I understand.' `Well, the old gentleman undoubtedly had property to dispose of, I think,' replied the attorney, evasively. `You drew it, I am told,' observed the other, cautiously approaching the point at which he was aiming. `Drafting instruments of that kind is part of my trade, you are aware,' remarked Vanderpool, still evading any direct answer to the question implied by the other's observation. `You will not deem it improper, I presume,' said Sherwood, `for me to enquire what are the provisions of the instrument, since I am the person most interested?' `Why, sir,' coolly remarked Vanderpool, `whether you are the most interested, I should think must depend entirely upon the will, whose provisions you seek to know. And as regards the propriety of your making enquiries respecting those provisions, I am not aware of any impropriety in your asking, but whether, in the case you assume, it would be proper for me to answer, for the present, would depend solely on the conditions imposed on me, and the instructions I have received.' `O, certainly, certainly, Mr. Vanderpool,' rejoined the other obsequiously, though he was evidently not a little startled at the ominous import of some of the attorney's remarks; `but what possible motive could my father have for enjoining secrecy in such a case?' `Why, that, Mr. Sherwood, is undoubtedly a question that the interrogator is no less competent of answering than the interrogatee,' replied the impurturbable attorney. `Why, surely, Mr. Vanderpool,' said the baffled heir in a tone of expostulation. `You do not think I wish you to do any thing wrong, I trust. But if the will be a just one, there can be no good reason for keeping its provisions a secret the short time that intervenes before it must be openly proved; and on the other hand if it be an unjust one, a delay can be of no benefit to the legatees of a will which can be so easily broken.' `Broken! how?' `Why, I suppose you must be aware, sir, that my father was not in his right mind when he executed this pretended will, as can be proved by the family.' Being a little nettled at the imputation involved in the last remark, that he had assisted in the making of a will when he knew the testator to be incompetent, the conscientious attorney with considerable spirit replied, `Whose testimony, think you, sir, would weigh the most in such case, two good, honest, intelligent witnesses, (to say nothing of myself,) who were present and heard the testator converse, or a stupid old woman, so deaf as not to hear one word in ten of an ordinary conversation, and a more stupid boy, who was rarely in his presence?' `O, I am no lawyer, sir,' rejoined Sherwood, with affected complaisance: `that must be left to gentlemen of your profession to decide. I merely repeated what was told me. And the only motive I have in making these enquiries is, to obtain such knowledge of the will as shall enable me to make my arrangements for the future; since I am compelled to return immediately to my post in the Grants. And now,' he continued, cautiously veering round on another track, `I really don't see how I can go without knowing something about the disposition of this property. It is a going to be such a disadvantage to me! Why, I would not begrudge a hundred pounds. Indeed, in my peculiar situation at this time, it might make more than that difference in my circumstances'— `Ah! indeed?' observed Vanderpool, beginning to suspect the drift of the other, but wishing to see how far he would venture to go, if encouraged a little. `Yes, that is really the case, Squire,' said Sherwood, thinking he had now hit upon a right course; `and if there are some nice rules among your profession to prevent your showing this will yourself in obedience to such very singular instructions, why, that can easily be got along with. The will can be left, for instance, on yonder shelf, or somewhere, so that should I come in to-morrow to write a letter, or 11 the like, it might be glanced at, and still no blame could fall on you—even if the instrument should be afterwards missing. All would come right between you and I, Squire, depend upon it. Now, I should suppose, that one live client, with my means, and with my friendship, would be worth a dozen dead ones, shouldn't you, Squire?' `Why, that might depend,' gravely replied the attorney, willing to alarm the other by way of punishing him for his insulting proposals, `that would depend, I should think, somewhat on the question whether the live client had means enough left him by the dead one to make good his promises.' `What mean you, sir?' hastily asked Sherwood, turning pale at the intimation. `O, I am merely making suppositions by way of answering your enquiries—you must put your own constructions upon them,' replied Vanderpool, with a look so equivocal as still to leave the would be tempter in doubt how to proceed. `Well, sir,' said Sherwood, after a hesitating pause, `what am I to understand you are willing to do in this business? Really a hard case for me, Squire—what do you say upon the whole?' `Upon the whole, then,' replied the indignant attorney, looking the other sternly in the face, `I say, sir, that it does not follow, that I am a villain and unworthy the trust reposed on me, because others may think they can make me so. I am sole executor on your father's estate, the real estate;—which is but a small portion of the property, you can take possession of as soon as you please, as to the rest, I shall take, and keep charge of it for the present. I know my duty, both towards you, and others concerned, and you may depend I shall do it. My supper waits. Good evening, sir.' So saying, and taking his hat, the independent and incorruptible attorney turned his back on the other, and immediately left the office. Vexed and discomfited at the failure of his attempt, and alarmed at the startling intimations which had fallen from Vanderpool, Sherwood turned his steps homeward. Reasoning from his own principles and feelings, he supposed that the attorney would never have withstood the different temptations which had thus been placed before him, unless he knew that the property was about to pass into the hands of others, whom it was now more his interest to serve. And joining this argument, unanswerable to one who could scarcely conceive of actions not prompted by interested and selfish motives, with the contemptuous bearing of the attorney, and the intimations he had dropped, the partially deceived, though justly punished heir arrived at the maddening conclusion, that his father must have bequeathed the greatest portion of his property to others; and in all probability to the Hendee family, to whom, besides being his only near relatives now left, his penitent and remorseful feelings would naturally direct his mind. And in addition to this, he was not without strong apprehensions, that his father had imparted to Vanderpool the secret which was contained in the letter directed to Captain Hendee, and which, in case the son of the latter was alive, would greatly multiply the chances of losing the other part of the property, also. And no sooner had he become confirmed in these conclusions, than he made up his mind in regard to the only alternative which he believed was now left him for securing the property. Accordingly, after making a few brief arrangements with a neighbor for managing the farm, he started that very night, and proceeded with all possible expedition to the New Hampshire Grants, where we will endeavor to meet him in another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Oh! what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceeive.” After a rapid journey by land, Sherwood arrived at his house in the Grants, inauspiciously for his present object, on the very evening on which his base and execrable manœuvres to cause the dismissal of Warrington had been discovered by Miss Hendee, in the manner we have described. And deeply intent on carrying into execution his project of a union with her, whom he supposed to be still the dupe of his machinations, believing this now to be his only resource for securing the property, and being determined to accomplish it, if possible, before the provisions of his father's will should be made known, to lessen his chances of success, he, early the next morning, repaired to her residence, for the purpose of urging an immediate fulfilment of the engagement, which he now chose to claim as having for several years existed between them. And from the well known wishes of the father, on whom he counted for a strong ally, and the late acquiescent manner of the daughter, he had the fuilest confidence that he should be able to bring about his object with very little difficulty or delay. When he arrived, however, he soon saw indications which considerably lowered the tone of his assurance. In the first place, he was not at all pleased to find, as he unexpectedly did, that Miss Reed had taken up her residence in the family, believing that she, from the connection which he suspected she sustained with Selden, the friend of Warrington, would naturally exercise her influence against one of whom she had doubtless received unfavorable impressions. And in addition to this, his quick eye detected a change in the manner of Alma herself towards him, which he fancied had reference to the subject of his present anxiety. And even in the demeanor of the father, he thought he perceived a want of cordiality, which never before marked his receptions. But notwithstanding all these discouraging appearances, he determined on persevering in his original purpose. And, carefully abstaining from all mention of his father's death, he early sought a private interview with Miss Hendee, who, with a sort of business-like promptitude, and with the air of one who is fully prepared for an eclaircissement, immediately assented to his propasal. `Mr. Sherwood has something particular to offer, I conclude?' enquiringly said Alma, with a most freezing dignity of manner, as soon as they were seated in a room by themselves. `Why, you know, Alma, my attentions to you have ever been particular,' replied Sherwood, with what he intended for an endearing smile. `Enough so, certainly,' was the equivocal response. `Well, I am happy,' rejoined the other, purposely 11* construing the remark in his own favor, `that you acquit me of any neglect in my attentions to one who is so worthy of them, and one in whom I have ever felt so deep an interest.' `You have manifested but little lack of interest in me, or my concerns, I am free to acknowledge, sir,' remarked Alma, in the same equivocal manner. `I hope I am not doubted in this respect,' said Sherwood, with the air of an arraigned school boy, attempting to put an immaterial issue, in order to escape, or delay, a blow, which he sees the disposer of his fate is preparing to give him. `O, not in the least, sir,' replied Alma, in a tone and manner still more ironical and significant than before; `for I have lately received a sufficient proof of the interest you have taken in my affairs, in the confessions of a certain tinker, whom you may recollect having consulted on the subject, on a former occasion?' `Why—now—really!' stammered Sherwood, utterly disconcerted at this cutting allusion to a transaction which he supposed was known only to himself and the immediate actor in the affair: `really, Miss Hendee, I have not the happiness of understanding your meaning.' `Would further disclosures be likely to increase your happiness in that respect, sir asked Alma, coolly. `I did not seek this interview. Miss Hendee,' rejoined the other, now recovering his assurance, `to listen to a recital of all the slanders that may have happened to reach your ears; but I sought it on more important business.' `I will hear your propositions, sir,' said she, without deigning any further reply. `Why, surely, Alma,' observed Sherwood, in an expostulating tone, `I know not how I have had the misfortune to offend you, as from your manner, I fear I have. I had fondly anticipated a different reception. I had at last arranged my business, so that I felt myself, for the first time since our intimacy, at liberty ro settle down in life; and, accordingly, I came to propose a consummation of the engagement, which has been so long settled between us.' `I wonder, sir,' said Alma, `you had not first made known your intentions to my father, with whom the engagement you claim to exist, was made, I believe. Perhaps you might meet with better success in that quarter.' `You seem disposed to trifle with my feelings, Miss Hendee,' rejoined Sherwood, growing restless. `I wish for a direct answer, whether you will, or will not, fulfil your engagement with me.' `A direct answer, Sir, then you shall have; and I will add, I feel not a little grateful for being, for the first time since my acquaintance with you, allowed the opportunity of giving one. Mr. Sherwood, I shall never voluntarily unite my destinies with yours.' `Surely, you would not break a solemn engagement?' `A passive acquiescence—a tacit consent, wrung from me by the force of circumstances, is, as you well know, sir, all the engagement that you can claim of me. And even that, your conscience must tell you, you have long since forfeited by your own conduct.' `Are you prepared, Miss, for the consequences which may follow the step you seem determined on taking?' `You do well, sir, I acknowledge, to remind me of that consideration,' bitterly retorted the indignant maiden; `for I am aware that it is no light matter to brave the revenge of one who could instigate the assassination of a supposed rival.' Sherwood started as if stung by an adder, at the damning truth of the allusion. His face became fairly livid with suppressed rage and chagrin, and biting his bloodless lips, he rose and slunk out of the apartment, as would a demon from the presence of some pure being from the skies, without uttering one word in his own defence, or even lifting his eyes to the withering countenance, which was bent upon him, with a look of mingled pity, abhorrence and contempt. Leaving the house, the discomfited villain immediately sought Captain Hendee in an adjoining field, for the purpose of instigating the old gentleman to measures of compulsion, upon the refractory daughter, in furtherance of his designs. But here, also, he was unexpectedly doomed to disappointment and defeat. Upon Alma's return to the house, after the receipt of the communication exposing the baseness of Sherwood, she had sought an interview with her father, read him the letter, frankly confessed her own feelings, and disclosed all she knew, not only of the course and conduct of Sherwood, but that also of Warrington, for a part of which she was indebted to her fair companion, who in turn received it from her lover, Selden, the intimate of Warrington. And among the rest, she had made known to the astonished father the magnanimous conduct of the latter in regard to his ownership of the land on which they resided, the circumstances of which she herself had never been apprised of till that very evening. And although the old gentleman had listened to her disclosures without uttering a single word in reply, from which she could learn his opinions on the subject, her communications, nevertheless, had produced a deep impression on his mind and feelings, that were now fluctuating back and forth, like contending currents of wind, when but a slight impulse is required to turn them back in fury in a direction exactly the reverse from that in which they commenced blowing. `I little expected, Captain Hendee,' said Sherwood, with the air of an injured man, as he approached the other, `I little expected, sir, when, I arrived here, to have met with the reception which I have just received from your daughter.' `Why, what's the matter, sir,—what's the matter?' replied the Captain, with an air of indifference. `The matter, sir? why, your daughter refuses to fulfil her engagement to me, sir.' `Ah! what reasons did she give for that, sir?' `No good reasons, sir. She has been listening to the tales of slanderers—some enemy has been prejudicing her mind against me, by falsehoods—utter falsehoods, sir!' `Or has she not heard, rather, more truth about your manœuvres than you intended should have reached her ears? Come, now, be honest, Jake, and tell me.' `Are you, too, in the league against me?—am I to understand that you, too, justify her in this course, sir?' hastily demanded Sherwood, nettled at the cool, indifferent manner of the other, as much as at the blunt severity involved in his question. `I had little expected this from you, sir! I should have supposed the interest of your family would prompt you to a different course.' `Hinging on my obligations, are you, sir?' said the Captain, turning fiercely on the other, with eyes flashing indignation. `Look ye, Jake Sherwood, I have, from the very first, used all reasonable exertions with my daughter, to reconcile her to this match. And even more, I have done that, which, when I have looked upon her fading face, and knew that she was martyring her own heart to please me, has smitten my conscience for years. And now I am resolved to leave her to make her decisions, unbiased by word of mine. And as to your threats, sir, all I have to say is, go, and do your worst! Take all there is here to yourself, if that will satisfy you; or go join the enemies of your country, as I have long suspected you intended,and bring them down upon us to murder and destroy, if you choose. But don't think to buy and bribe me to sell my own flesh and blood! And don't come here again, sir, with accusations against us, till you can come with cleaner hands. Good morning, sir!' So saying, the indignant old man unceremoniously turned his back on his abashed and astonished guest, and hastily hobbled off to his work; while the latter, after standing mute and motionless on the spot several minutes, and leering on the receding form of the other, with the concentrated malice of a fiend in his looks, slowly turned away, muttering between his clenched teeth, `Revenge! revenge! I wonder if they will cheat me out of that too?' Feeling no desire of returning to the house, or again encountering any of its inmates, Sherwood now struck across the fields, and directed his course towards Snake Mountain, at the particular spot which we have before described as the encampment of the Green Mountain Boys; but which was now occupied by another, and a far different company. To this place we will now take the reader, preceding the baffled intriguer a short time, to take a glance at the party there assembled. Sherwood had secretly been in the interests of the Royalists for nearly two years previous to this period of our story; and more than a year before he had received a captain's commission, with directions to raise a company in the New Hampshire Grants, in which, he had represented to the British officers, with whom he privately kept up a communication, were to be found many faithful adherents of the Crown. And Darrow, through Sherwood's influence, had also been commissioned as Lieutenant of the contemplated company. But with all that this pair of military worthies were able to effect, they never had found more than about a half dozen men in this settlement, to whom they dared to propose an enlistment into the king's sorvice. These, with about an equal number picked up within the borders of New York, they had at length enrolled, and organized into a fragment of a company, which, for the first time, had been called out a few days previous to this time, with the view of cooperating with the invading army of Burgoyne. About a dozen in all, they were now encamped, on the ground, formerly taken, as before mentioned, by Warrington and his companions, and were waiting in concealment, the approach of the British hordes, that were now pouring down upon the devoted settlement from the north. At the time we would introduce this group to the reader, Darrow had just arrived from the British camp, whither he had been dispatched by Sherwood, when the latter was on the point of setting out on his recent visit to Albany. And having taken some refreshment, the lieutenant was now sitting on a rough bench, near the entrance of their shantee, enjoying a little repose after the fatigues of his morning's march. He had fallen into a doze, and appeared to be lost to all external objects; while the men within, mostly morose, sullen looking fellows, were some of them playing cards, some telling stories, and others talking over the plans they had formed to revenge themselves upon certain families in the settlement, against whom they entertained private grudges, as soon as they should be let loose upon the inhabitants, at present wholly unprotected by any military force within their borders, and but little aware of the dangers that awaited them. At this moment, Sherwood, having passed the line of sentries, posted at intervals round the encampment, more to guard against being seen and reported by the inhabitants, than any expected attack, approached his sleeping subaltern, and tapped him lightly on the shoulder. But the latter not awaking, the other grasped his coat collar, and gave him a rough, impatient shake, at which the sleeper, suddenly starting, leaped on his feet, and dashing away the grasping hand of his superior, fiercely exclaimed, `I'll be d—ned, if you shall! You have come before your time, be off! be off, I say! Oh! Ah!' he continued, rubbing his eyes, and beginning to distinguish between the reality, and the image that appeared to have been haunting his dreaming fancy: `Why, Captain, it is only you after all, is it? Well, well, now!' `Why, who did you suppose it was, Darrow, I should like to know?' `O, no matter, now,—I was in the middle of a cursed dream, and thought a different character had waited on me to do a little business in his line— though not so very different, perhaps. But let the humbug go—what is the news?' `Every thing that is bad,' replied Sherwood, morosely. `The very devil himself, I would not have believed, could baffle me so much in my plans, as I have been, since I saw you.' `Why, what now, Captain? you seem rather out of humor—what has happened?' `In the first place the old man is dead. He died the day before I arrived.' `Well, what of that? He did not carry off his money with him, did he?' `No, but he got penitent before he went off, and wrote out a confession of that old affair, in a letter to Hendee.' `And you let it reach him, hey?' `Not so big a fool as you think. I gave it to the flames, before it was read by any one but myself, I think.' `Very well, where are your great troubles, then?' `Why—why'—replied Sherwood, hesitating to inform the other, as he was about to do, the particulars about the will, and the extent of his fears respecting the disposition of the property, lest the minion might consider it for his interest to betray him to the Hendees: `why, I did not think to name it,' continued the artful dissembler, deciding the question he had been debating in his mind in the negative, `but, upon the whole, as you already know so much about the affair, I think I will:—well, getting 12 home last night, I thought I would go down to Hendee's this morning; so I went, and soon found the devil to pay. That sneaking tinker had been there, and confessed all, and the girl fairly spurned me from her presence; while her father—curse the old dotard! he, though owing me for half his living for years, had the audacity to insult me—yes, insult me, Bill. But'—and he nodded significantly. `But what?' `I can help myself, Darrow.' `Well, I would do it, Jake, without any more puttering with the proud minx.' `I will. My plans are fixed. When did you return from head quarters?' `Not two hours ago—I left them early this morning.' `What is the news?' `The whole army have moved on to the mouth of the Bouquet, where they are now encamped. A large body of Indians joined them yesterday, and General Burgoyne distributed presents among them, made a speech to fix them for fight, and wound off by giving them a grand war-feast. Hell and thunder! what whooping and yelling there was there last night! one would have thought that all Tophet had been emptied upon the earth, and that the world was alive with devils!' `Good! just the instruments for our purpose in punishing the doubly damned rebels of this settlement. But did not the General send me any directions?' `Yes,' replied Darrow, taking a letter from his pocket, `he sent you this, and also,' he continued, stepping within the shantee and bringing out a thick package of papers, `and also this bundle of proclamations, to be immediately distributed over the settlement.' `Well, let us first see what the General has written me,' said Sherwood breaking the superb seal, and reading the contents of the letter, a very fair specimen of the official fustian of its doughty author, who, it may be recollected, was a fop in literature as well as a braggart in arms. The communication ran thus:— J. Sherwood, Esq., Captain of His Majesty's Loyal Americans in the New Hampshire Grants,— It is one of the felicities of soldiership, and of the gratifications of a commander, to award the meed of approbation to fidelity in a common cause, and fealty to a common sovereign. This meed, Sir, I deem it no flattery to say is yours, speaking, as I do, from personal acquaintance, and on the voucher of Colonel Beverly Robinson, a Loyal American officer, of worth, and zeal, and activity. The army under my command will now in a day or two move southwardly, mainly by water, but partly by land on either side of the lake. To you, Sir, and the brave and loyal men whom you have, and may yet further induce to act with you, we look for a hearty co-operation in all that can be effected on the eastern shore, and, by the blessing of God, I will effect much, while we proceed to the investiture, and consequent capture of Crown Point, Ticonderoga, and all other opposing obstacles, on our victorious march to Albany. I send you by the bearer, Lieutenant William Darrow, a package of proclamations, issued by me, and signed by the same, and countersigned by Robert Kingston, Esquire, Secretary. They are addresses to the deluded and suffering people of your settlement. I anticipate great and universal effect from this appeal, made irresistable, as it is, by offers of Royal mercy to the penitent, arguments of ineffable potency to the deceived by rebel sophistry and falsehood, and by the palpable shadowing forth of the sword of justice, in the contingent action of our red allies, to the perverse and stubborn. You will cause one of these, my proclamations, to be immediately left at every cottage and hamlet, if possible, in the settlement—to the protestations of which proclamation, together with such pecuniary inducements as you may deem it expedient to offer towards redeeming the land from the disgrace and ruinous anarchy of an unnatural rebellion, and restoring a government of laws, of honor, of legitimate and happy sovereignty, you will add your own attestations. With sentiments, believe me, my very dear sir, of esteem, J. Burgoyne. `There! what think you of that, Bill?' exultingly exclaimed Sherwood, as he concluded the perusal of the precious document. `Is not that a handsome thing for a man, who stands so high at the British court, to say to, and of us?' `Why, yes, Captain, what he means is well enough, I spose; but if a British General had not writ it, I should have called some of it nothing but damn flumididdle.' `O, it is a feather in our caps, Darrow, depend on't. Burgoyne is hand and glove with the king and ministers, besides being a noted warrior. He will conquer all the northern colonies. The rebellion, indeed, is as good as crushed already. And then the country will be divided off into lordships, and those, who have been most active in subduing the rebels, will all receive rich rewards out of their confiscated estates. Bright days are before us, Bill. And while we are thus making our fortunes, what a glorious chance to pay off old scores upon these rascally settlers? You can safely act out nature now, Bill, with a vengeance. We will now have our revenge, and the beauty of it is, that others must father our deeds and pay us well into the bargain for what it is only a happiness to perform.' `What are your plans, Captain?' `You, or I, must go, this very night, over to the British camp, and get Burgoyne to let us have fifty red skins to make up our company. We shall want them soon, and perhaps I may for the first purpose.' `Damn it, Jake, you are too thirsty,' said the minion, looking keenly at the other, and comprehending the purpose of which he spoke: `they are your own flesh and blood. You don't mean to let those red devils loose upon them, do you?' `No, but leave me to take care of them. They need not be harmed, but prisoners they shall be, till that haughty jade's pride is brought to begging terms. And this is the first case, Darrow, to be attended to.' `I am not quite sure but there is another case for you to attend to, also, Jake.' `What is that?' asked Sherwood, turning to the other with a look of blended curiosity and apprehension. `Why, perhaps it is all nothing but a notion, after all. But I will tell you the wrinkle that's got into my head, and how it got there: In coming from head quarters to day, I ran my canoe generally close in to the shore of the other side of the lake, and, on 12* arriving within about a mile of Crown Point, and about as far as I intended, before crossing over to this side, I took it into my head I would go up into the woods, climb a tree, and try to get a peep into the fort, as the General asked me very particularly about the number of the garrison there. Well, I went on a piece into the woods, when I heard the steps of some one crossing my course ahead, and taking his way to the fort; so I squatted down in an old tree top, where I could remain unseen till he passed by. His course brought him within a few rods of the spot where I lay; and when nearly abreast of me, he mounted an old log, and, without discovering me, took a sort of leisurly survey of the woods around him, turning his face so as to give me a fair view of his countenance—and'— `Well, what more about it—who, and what was he?' `Why, though not in full uniform, I think he must be a young rebel officer, who had been out with his gun for game. Though he must have arrived at the fort quite lately.' `But who do you mistrust him to be?' asked Sherwood, with evident uneasiness. `That is the question that has been bothering my brains ever since. Jake, don't you think it possible for a man to wear about the same face and look that he did when a boy, so that one, who had never seen him from four or five years old, would know him again when grown up?' `Yes, barely possible, but what the devil are you coming to, Bill? What has that to do with this case?' demanded Sherwood, with an agitation which he was unable to conceal. `May be a good deal. There was something in this fellow's looks that struck me,—that made me ready to swear I had seen the same countenance before, though some how, not just the same neither. Well, he finally went on, and I forgetting all about spying into the fort, went back, and struck off for this side, this fellow's countenance all the while haunting me, and working up a devilish strange, streaked, kind of feeling, that I can't very well describe. Well, as I was crossing over, still bothering on the subject, I happened to cast my eyes up the lake, when I caught a glimpse of old Hendee's house through the trees; and by heavens! it came across my mind, like a flash of lightning, who the fellow must be.' `What mean you, Darrow?' exclaimed Sherwood, seizing the arm of the other with a convulsive grasp, while his face became as pale as ashes. `I mean,' replied Darrow, looking his agitated companion full in the face, and speaking in a low, measured, and decisive tone, `I mean, Jake Sherwood, that if Captain Hendee's boy lived, he is now among us!' Long and earnestly communed these worthies in conjectures, about the person concerning whom Darrow had made, as he felt confident he had, so startling a discovery. Who could he be? By what name now known? Could he be aware of his own family history? Had he discovered his relations? were questions which were raised by them, but without finding any satisfactory answers. The two last questions, however, were at length settled in the negative. And after some further discussion, in regard to the best means of ascertaining more about the private history of the unconscious object of their deliberations, and the most feasible way of disposing of him, if the information gained rendered it probable he was the person they feared him to be, they broke up their conference, Darrow retiring to rest, and Sherwood, with two of his men, as attendants and oarsmen, setting off for head quarters, fifteen or twenty miles distant from the tory encampment.</field>

I anticipate great and universal effect from this appeal, made irresistable, as it is, by offers of Royal mercy to the penitent, arguments of ineffable potency to the deceived by rebel sophistry and falsehood, and by the palpable shadowing forth of the sword of justice, in the contingent action of our red allies, to the perverse and stubborn. You will cause one of these, my proclamations, to be immediately left at every cottage and hamlet, if possible, in the settlement—to the protestations of which proclamation, together with such pecuniary inducements as you may deem it expedient to offer towards redeeming the land from the disgrace and ruinous anarchy of an unnatural rebellion, and restoring a government of laws, of honor, of legitimate and happy sovereignty, you will add your own attestations. With sentiments, believe me, my very dear sir, of esteem, J. Burgoyne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “Sounds from the waters, sounds upon the earth, Sounds in the air, of battle! Yet with these A voice is mingling, whose deep tones give birth To faith and courage!” The storm of war which had been gathering for some weeks in the north almost unnoticed by the Americans, now began to roll down upon their frontier settlements with a rapidity as alarming as it was unexpected. Although the leaders of the continental army were aware of the landing of a large British force at Quebec, in the month of May, from which an invasion was expected, either by way of Oswego, as had previously been given out, or through the valley of lake Champlain; yet, counting on the same dilatory action, by which all the movements of the enemy had been characterized ever since the battle of Bunker Hill, they supposed it might be late in the summer before the hostile army, should they take the eastern route, would reach the military posts on Champlain. But whatever might have been the errors of other British commanders in the respect just named, none of that kind certainly could be chargeable on General Burgoyne. The navigable waters of the north had scarcely burst their wintery fetters before he landed at Montreal. And in another week he was pouring the disciplined bands of his proud and numersous army along the western shores of lake Champlain. The American Generals were, in a great measure, taken by surprise by this rapid advance of the enemy, and having delayed to strengthen their defences, they were but illy prepared to meet the first shock of so powerful a force. And if those, whose duty it was to make themselves early acquainted with the enemy's movements had thus been kept in the dark respecting the important one in question, still less, as may well be supposed, were the inhabitants of the country apprised of the time and extent of the coming invasion. The settlers of the New Hampshire Grants, who were directly in the route of the enemy, were consequently almost wholly ignorant of the dangers that awaited them, till the storm was nearly ready to burst on their defenceless heads. And their surprise, therefore, was only equalled by their dismay, when the American scouts, who had been dispatched to gain intelligence of the reported invasion, returned and spread the startling news, that a British army of ten thousand regulars, with several thousand savage foes, was within a few miles of their borders, ready to spread death and devastation over their whole settlement. This information, which many still hoped might be false, or greatly exaggerated, was fully confirmed the next morning after it was received by the scouts, by Burgoyne's proclamations, which, through the activity of Sherwood's band of tories, had been left during the night at the door of every house thro' all the northern section of the country. This pompous and gasconading document, however, with all its promises and threats, had, notwithstanding its author's anticipations, no other effect on the inhabitants than to bring them to the determination of driving off their stock so far into the interior as to be out of the reach of the enemy, and of commencing active preparations for fleeing themselves befor the invading army. With these general observations on the situation of affairs at this particular junction, we will now return to the Hendee family, to follow their fortunes through the fearful trials which were now shortly to await them. It was not till night, after the signal failure of Sherwood at the cottage, that Miss Hendee had an opportunity of ascertaining what had passed between that personage and her father in their recent interview. That evening Captain Hendee, on his return from the labors of the day, entered the room where Alma happened at the moment to be sitting alone, and silently took a seat at the open window. A frown was upon his brow. The uneasiness, which a man of high spirit might be expected to feel from a sense of obligations to one he secretly despises, combined, in the present instance, with the mean advantage taken of such obligations by Sherwood, had, all the afternoon, been operating upon the old gentleman's irritable temperament; and he was now evidently in no very pleasant frame of mind. At the first glance his daughter detected in his countenance the unfailing indications of a storm: but on whom it was to burst, she was unable to determine. From the circumstances attending the interview between Sherwood and her father, she felt satisfied, that she, herself, had been the subject of their discourse; and although extremely anxious to know the result of that conference, yet she almost feared the knowledge she wished to obtain. And with trembling solicitude, therefore, she awaited in silence the announcement, which she saw from her father's mood, would not long be withheld. After sitting some minutes puffing away rapidly at his pipe, and knitting his brows, with an angry flashing expression of countenance, he suddenly drew the implement from his mouth, and, by way of knocking out the ashes, gave it so spiteful a rap on the window sill as to shiver it to pieces in his hand. Hastily dashing the broken fragments out of the window, he turned abruptly to his daughter, and said, `Alma, what did Jake Sherwood say to you today?' `Why, many things, father,—would you wish me to repeat all he said?' `Yes. I don't hold to prying into such matters, for a general rule, but I have particular reasons for wishing to know now.' Still feeling uncertain on whom the resentment of her father was about to fall, Alma, with some agitation, proceeded to detail the conversation in question, giving the words used by Sherwood, and the substance of her own replies. “Threats to you, too, hey?' said the Captain, after listening attentively to his daughter's relation of the affair. `Why did'nt you drive the pitiful puppy from the house with your broomstick?' `You astonish me, father!' replied Alma, looking up into the face of the other with an expression of joyful surprise. The old gentleman made no reply, but again relapsing into moody silence, sat some time without uttering a word. At length he brought his foot to the floor with an angry, decisive stamp—and while the tears, which were brought to his eyes by his keenly conflicting emotions, were glimmering on the quickly moving lashes, he again turned suddenly to his expecting daughter and asked, `Alma, are you willing to become a slave?' `For my own, and your support, I could cheerfully become one, dear father. But a slave to a villain I can never be.' `Nobly said! spoken with the spirit of a Hendee! would to God I was more worthy of such a daughter!' exclaimed the passionate old man, choking with emotion `come here, Alma, I have been wrong, and you have been right,—come, come to me, my child, forgive, and kiss me.' In another instant the father and daughter were locked in each other's arms, intermingling their tears, and giving themselves up to the gush of feelings which was overflowing their hearts at this return of mutual love and confidence to their long estranged and distrusting bosoms. `I did not make any reply to you, Alma, when you laid open to me the conduct of that base and intriguing villain,' at length, observed the Captain, releasing his daughter from his embrace, and regaining his composure, though the other continued weeping. `But it was not because I doubted the truth of what you told me, or because I had it in my heart to try to restrain you any further. It was because I felt self-condemned, guilty—guilty for what I had already done in making war upon the happiness, and I know not but upon the health, of my own, and only child. O, don't weep so—don't, my dear daughter! Thank God, we have both now cut the ties by which we were held in bondage, and are free. The Sherwood's may have all; and we won't trouble them neither to drive us off: we will leave this place, Alma, for the southern part of the settlement. As old and infirm as I am, I can still work. Our faithful Neshobee will also stick by us, and work as much as an Indian will ever work, for you know the Indians are a lazy race, and we must make allowance for him. But at all events, as poorly as we may fare, our poverty will be happiness compared to the slavery that Jake Sherwood would now impose on us if we remained. Yes, Alma, we will go—that is if you are willing. What say you, my daughter, are you ready to relinquish this pleasant home, and go with me, penniless, indeed, but with the proud and happy consciousness that we are free.' `O, yes, yes, indeed, my dear father,' eagerly replied the other, with a look of joy and gratitude, that beamed brightly through her still fast falling tears; `and never could an eastern slave leave his gilded fetters behind him with more pleasure than I shall quit this place. Yes yes; and, believe me, my father, however hard my lot—however menial I had known would be my employment for support, I have not seen an hour for the last two long and joyless years, but my heart would have leaped to hear you make such a proposal. And if such then were my feelings, judge what must now be my pleasure to hear your announcement.' The conversation was here interrupted by a light rap on the door, and while the Captain and his daughter were pausing for a repetition of the sound, uncertain whether it proceeded from some one wishing 13 for admittance, the door was partly opened by a man without, and the queer visage of our old friend, Pete Jones, was protruded with a comical, enquiring look, into the room. `How are ye?' he said, after glancing from father to daughter a moment, with a half sheepish, half roguish expression, indicating his consciousness of having, on a former occasion, played a little upon the credulity of the old gentleman, of which he felt slightly ashamed, though still inwardly tickled at the recollection of the trick: `how are ye, Captain? Sarvant, marm!' `It is Mr. Jones of the army, father, the person who gave me the news I imparted to you respecting the expected invasion,' observed Miss Hendee, noticing that her father did not recognise the scout. `Ah! the tall gentleman that called here once— I recollect—did you try my remedy—but no matter, now—walk in, walk in, sir,' said the Captain. `Why, no, thankee,' replied Jones, leaning his long body on his arm, and swaying it to and fro, by the play of the door on it its hinges, as he grasped the handle, `I guess I'm rather too much in a hurry about these times.' `You called on some errand, then?—to give us some news, perhaps?' rejoined the Captain, expectingly. `Why, yes—that is, if you would like to hear it —that is, if you han't heard it already.' `Speak on, sir.' `Well, I thought I'd just pop in my countenance, as I came along back, to see, that in case the devil was at your heels, whether you would like to know it?' `You speak in riddles—how shall I understand you, sir?' `Well, I an't particular, how.' `You said the devil?' `Yes, and his name is Legion. Why, to be plain about it, Captain, a British army of ten thousand, with as many red skins as one would wish to see, will most likely be here before to-morrow night.' `You astonish me, sir! Has any news of this reached the other settlers in this quarter?' `I have just sent a brother scout up the road here, to tell them they may as well be driving off their cattle, and jogging along south themselves in course of to-morrow. I just come from the fort over here, and they've pretty much concluded to pack up there, and be off for Old Ti to night; so the red coats and Indians will have full play along the shores till they get to Ti, where there will be something of a brush, likely.' `You would advise us women and cripples, then, to beat a retreat, would you?' `Why, yes, that's rather my notion, considering. Though Burgoyne says—haven't you seen his proclamation?' `No.' `Well, you will soon, I guess. The tories have scattered 'em as thick as bumblebees along north of here. Burgoyne says, as nigh as I can English the high flown concern, “stay at home, sell him your cattle, and he will protect you. But if you budge an inch, he will let loose the red skins to act at their pleasure upon you.” And what that will be, you know as well as any man, they say, Captain.' `Yes, I know enough of their tender mercies. And I know also that Burgoyne, whatever he may promise, can no more restrain the hell-hounds, after he has once let them from their slips, than he can crupper the whirlwinds. Montcalm tried that experiment, on that dreadful day of blood and horror, at Fort William Henry—at least, I think he tried to avert the catastrophe: for Montcalm, though an enemy that troubled us much, was yet a brave man; and as a general rule, my friend, you will never find a truly brave man either cruel or treacherous. The great sin is in employing the Indians. And this circumstance will do much, in the present case, to hasten the destruction of Burgoyne. Even the dead, almost, will rise up to bear arms against him. All New England in a week, will be in motion. In another week, as he passes along up the lake, they will be hanging like an angry thunder cloud on his flank. And, mark my word, sir, this general will find, before he reaches Albany, that neither his numbers nor his proclamations will save him.' `The Lord grant you may prove a true prophet; and I think, upon the whole, you will. Howsomever, Captain, it will be considerable of a chore to bring it all to pass. And while we are fixing for it, I rather guess you, along the northern parts here, may as well make yourselves scarce a little.' `We intend it, sir. Indeed, as regards my family, we had already determined on a removal soon. And now we shall follow your advice immediately, with many thanks to you for calling. Let me see— our first move shall be for Rutland, where we can probably safely remain a few days, to conclude on a place for a more permanent residence.' `Will you, sir,' said Miss Hendee, with a slight blush, as she perceived the scout was about to depart, `will you apprise our friends in the army of the destination we think of taking?' `Will you take this, sir, to the person to whom it is addressed?' said Miss Reed, who, during the latter part of the conversation, had been nimbly plying her fingers over the blank leaf of a little volume which she had been reading in an adjoining apartment, when the scout's voice and anticipated errand brought her into the room. `You see, Alma, I am not afraid to write to my beau; now I will leave it to the Captain to say, who is the bravest?' she added, turning to the latter with an expression in which roguish defiance, and fear of disapprobation, were queerly blended. `Ah, girls,' said the Captain in reply, after a moment's hesitation, which seemed to end in a conclusion to treat the matter good naturedly, `you may be setting your caps for men that will be swinging on the gallows in three months: for you know, in attempted revolutions, men are only patriots and heroes when they succeed, and are but rebels and traitors when they don't.' `We prefer, however,' replied Alma, with spirit, `to set our caps for men who may be hung on that principle, rather than for those who should be hung on every other.' `Is not there a law, Captain Hendee,' asked Jessy, archly, `that a man may be pardoned on the gallows, if a lady can be found who will step up and marry him on the spot?' `Why, I have heard such stories,' replied the Captain, laughing, `but supposing there was such a provision, in this country, you little quiz?' `Why, in that case,' replied Jessy, casting a roguish look at Alma, `I think there are certain officers 13* in our army who need not be under any great apprehensions of being hung at present.' `Now, that is what I call grit,' observed Jones, who had been looking on the two beautiful and spirited creatures before him, with an admiration equalled only by his surprise. `The Colonel and Captain know considerable well what they have been about, after all, I see. Well, I must be jogging, I guess, Captain, so good nighty. And you, galls, may the Lord bless ye, and keep you steadfast in your resolution! If I had a hogshead of blood, it should all be shed for ye, and the like of ye. Trol, lol, lol, lol de larly!' During that night and the following day, all was bustle and commotion throughout the northern part of the settlement. “To arms! to arms!” resounded in every direction. And nearly all the able bodied men, promptly responding to the call of General Schuyler, whose expresses were seen furiously dashing along the roads to rally the hitherto slumbering settlement, seized their rifles or muskets and hastened off to join their countrymen in arms, leaving the old men, invalids and boys, to take charge of their families, in removing from the scene of danger. The stock was collected in droves, marked with the initials of the owner's name and started off for the south; while the inhabitants, taking with them all the articles of value, which their respective modes of travelling would permit, collected in small companies, and soon followed. The party whose destinies more immediately concern our story, consisting of Captain Hendee, Neshobee, the two young ladies, and their respective female domestics, in the course of the day, bade adieu to their pleasant cottage, and mingled in the general flight, which, by night fall, brought them in safety to the house of a hospitable friend, nearly twenty miles distant from the home, to which, as they supposed, they were never more to return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. — “Not all so much for love, As for another secret close intent, By marrying her, which I must reach unto, But yet I run before my horse to market; Clarence still breathes: Edward still lives, and, When these are gone, then must I count my gains.” Several unforseen circumstances connected with the removal of their effects, together with the impression that they were now so far south as to be in no very immediate danger from any incursions of the enemy, having induced our party to accept the invitation of their kind entertainer to remain a few days at his abode, nearly a week had unfortunately been suffered to elapse without resuming their journey. Aroused, however, at length, by the news that Burgoyne had reached Ticonderoga, and closely invested the fortress, while a party of tories and Indians were ravaging the country to the north of them, both the families of Captain Hendee and his host, determined on an instant departure for a place of more safety. Accordingly, with a few hasty preparations, they started in their respective carriages about the middle of the afternoon for Castleton, which they were under the expectation of being enabled to reach by day-light. The day being excessively sultry, Captain Hendee, after travelling awhile at rather a brisk pace, checked his horses, and suffered them to fall into a moderate walk, during which the other party, who were in advance, and who seemed less disposed to slacken their speed, passed entirely out of sight, and soon became widely separated from their more tardy fellow travellers. When our party had proceeded several miles in this leisurely manner, and while the Captain, to use a quaint and somewhat curious expression of the poet Parnell, was “deceiving the road,” by the relation of one of his old war stories, they were met by a stout built, though an ordinary looking, and slovenly dressed man on horseback, who, after closely scrutinizing the company a moment, stopped his horse, indicating, at the same time by his looks and gestures, a wish that the others should stop also. Supposing the stranger was desirous of making some enquiries, Captain Hendee instantly pulled up his horses, and sat waiting, with an air of expectation, for the man to proceed with what he might have to propose. `I was thinking what your name mought be, mister,' at length began the horseman, with a bold, saucy air. `It kinder seems to me I have seen you somewhere or other.' `Very possible, sir,' replied the Captain, in a manner sufficiently cool and repulsive, as he thought, to check the intrusive familiarity of the other. `Well, I knowed I had,' rejoined the stranger, not at all abashed by the coolness with which his advances had been met, `and yet I don't know as I can quite call you by name.' `My name is Hendee, sir.' `Ah! O, yes;—you live down there against Crown Point?' `Yes; or at least we did till within a few days. But how happens it, that you are going to a part, which, at this time, the settlers are so generally deserting?' `Why an't it safe travelling that way?' `It would be for some, doubtless,' replied the Captain significantly. `Well, I spose you've hearn of me,' observed the stranger, evidently disconcerted at the suspicions which he perceived were beginning to be entertained of him, `my name is David Remington. You are acquainted in Castleton, an't you?' `Yes, with several individuals in that town.' `Well, that's where I live, when I'm to home. Do you know Mr. Woodward there?' `I do, sir.' `I want to know? Well, now, he is one of my near neighbors. Here's a paper he gin me 'tother day. Jest read it, will ye?' Captain Hendee, with an air of curiosity, not unmingled, however, with surprise, at an offer so gratuitously made to an entire stranger, took the paper, which the other now extended to him, and read as follows:— “This may certify that David Remington, the bearer hereof, is thought to be a true friend to the States of America. JOSEPH WOODWARD, Com. of Safety.[1] [1] A literal copy of the original certificate, lodged in the public archives of Vermont, and accompanied by another from the noted tory, Colonel Philip Skene, certifying that Remington had taken the oath of allegiance, and was a true Royalist. These papers, together with a receipt signed by “J. Sherwood, Captain,” for two heifers procured for the British, by Remington, all dated about the same time, are supposed to have been found on the person of this or other tories, when subsequently slain or taken prisoners. Castleton, June 2d, 1777.” `This appears to be genuine, and should be sufficient,' remarked the Captain musingly, as he handed back the paper. `Have they received any news at Castleton within a day or too, sir?' he added, with more freedom of manner than he had before exhibited towards the other. `News?—from where?' `From our forces at Ticonderoga, I mean, of course.' `O, yes, I spose so—why, I came from there, myself, last night.' `Indeed, sir? Well, what is the prospect of St. Clair's being able to cope with the enemy, so as to put a stop to their progress at that place?' `Cope! hum! He will be lucky if he don't get coped himself, I guess.' `What, sir! The garrison are in no danger of being taken themselves, surely?' `Well, sir, I don't pretend to know nothing about it; but I shouldn't be surprised if the folks about here heard news, within twenty-four hours, that made 'em stare.' `Impossible! But what is the situation of affairs there, that leads you to this conclusion?' `Why, sir, the situation is, that General Red Hazle, [2] [2] From original papers, still preserved, written by those, whose spelling was evidently guided solely by the common pronunciation of words, it appears that Gen. Reidesel went, to a considerable extent, at least, by the name of Red Hazle. with his Jarman brigade, has got possession on this side of the lake, up as far as East Creek, where he is now posted; while General Burgoyne has entirely enclosed the fort on 'tother side. And what is still more, he has cut out a road, and drawn up a whole slew of cannon clean to the top of Mount Defiance, which he will have all mounted, and ready to pour hell and thunder down on 'em in the fort before they dream of it.' `Is it possible that St. Clair can have suffered Burgoyne to get possession of that commanding spot for such a purpose!' exclaimed the Captain. `I knew,' he continued, `that most of our officers in the old war used to consider that mountain inaccessible with artillery. I, however, always thought differently, and agreed, in this respect, with Major Putnam, who, I well remember, suggested the project of getting cannon up this eminence to General Howe, as our army was approaching the fort the day previous to the battle, which cost poor Howe his life. And had that gallant young nobleman, who was the only lord of common sense whom the British ever sent to America, been spared, the thing would have been done, and we should have taken the fortress, instead of drawing off our army without effecting any thing. But as I said, is it possible that St. Clair can have permitted this in an army approaching from the north, and wholly unacquainted with the surrounding localities?' `It is true, any how; and if they don't find themselves in a pickle, there in the fort, by to-morrow morning, I lose my guess,' replied the other, with a satisfaction which he was unable wholly to conceal. After a few apparently careless enquiries respectin the destination of our travellers, and their expectations of reaching it, Remington seemed suddenly to become convinced that it would not be prudent to proceed any farther in the land-looking excursion, which he stated was his business to the north, and announced his intention of immediately returning. Accordingly wheeling round his horse, and bidding the company good day, with the remark, that he should probably ride rather faster than their team would travel, he rode off at a moderate trot, till the intervening bushes at the first turn of the road screened him, as he supposed, from the sight of those he had just left, when he applied his whip, and dashed forward at full speed. `What opinion did you form of that man, father?' asked Miss Hendee, after they had ridden some distance in silence. `Why, but for the certificate of so true and vigilant a friend to the cause as Woodward, who undoubtedly signed it, I should certainly have had strong suspicions that the fellow was some designing tory,' answered the Captain, indirectly, and with the tone of one still doubting over evidence which he could not reject, nor yet receive as wholly conclusive. `I know not,' rejoined the other, `that I can give any good reasons for my impressions; but there was a certain something about the man, which, from the first, struck me unfavorably. And is it not possible, that he may be secretly in the interest of the enemy, notwithstanding his certificate, which, without being asked, he was so ready to show?' `I noticed his readiness to show the paper,' again replied the Captain, without any direct answer to his daughter's question. `And it also occurred to me, that he appeared to be far better acquainted with the movements of the British, than with those of our own army.' `And did not you think, Captain Hendee,' observed Miss Reed, `that he betrayed a secret pleasure, when relating the perilous situation in which he stated the American forces to be placed?' `I don't know that I noticed that in particular,' said the Captain; `but if he be a tory, and has told us the truth, I fear he has too much reason to rerejoice. I cannot think, however, that St. Clair will fail to keep open a way for retreat, so that the garrison shall not be taken in any event.' `Here, Neshobee,' said Alma, as the Indian, who had travelled mostly on foot, keeping generally a few rods in advance of the horses, now fell back to the side of the carriage, `you have sometimes shown yourself a shrewd guesser; and we will have your opinion in this case. What did you think of the man father was talking with just now?' `Me guess him have two tongue—mean something no good,' replied the native, in his usual quiet manner. `Him no think me see him through the bush, when him ride away slow—then look back for find out we see him, then whip—off a gallop!' `So much the better,' remarked Jessy, `for the faster he goes the further he will get from us.' `Neshobee, perhaps, would draw a different inference,' said the Captain. `Why should he, father?' asked Alma. But the other, not willing to alarm the ladies by naming his secret apprehensions, which, after all, might prove groundless, made only some evasive, or indifferent reply, and became silent. `He can have no immediate communication with the tories and Indians, by going in that direction,' resumed Alma. `They, if we were rightly informed, are still far behind us.' `They were behind us,' observed Captain Hendee, relapsing into silence, in which his example was soon imitated by the rest of the company, all of whom seemed oppressed by that undefined sense of impending danger, which is sometimes felt without 14 the inclination,—on account of conscious inability, perhaps,—of communicating it to others. It was now drawing towards sunset; and our party had yet nearly ten miles to travel before reaching their proposed destination for the night. They had been, for some miles, passing through a dark, continuous forest, whose unvaried gloom soon began to be increased by the shades, which, before the usual hour, were slowly stealing over the wilderness, in consequence of the broad and depening masses of vapor now gathering along the western horizon. And presently the low, deep rumbling of distant thunder, heralding an approaching shower, reached the ears of the company, and increased their anxiety to gain some opening, at least, before storm and darkness, to say nothing of their secret apprehensions of more terrible foes, should overtake them. Casting an uneasy glance at the lurid and threatening aspect of the heavens, Captain Hendee applied the whip, and was urging on his horses to renewed efforts of speed, when his arm was suddenly seized by the convulsive grasp of his daughter. `Stop! stop! father,' she exclaimed, in a low, hurried tone, `look at Neshobee! There is danger near us.' All eyes were at once directed towards the Indian, who was now about a dozen rods in front of the carriage. He had turned round, and, with quick and eager gestures, was motioning them to halt. Instantly reigning up the horses, and bringing them to a stand, the Captain, with the rest of the company, continued, with intense interest and alarm, silently to watch the motions of the native, who seemed to be still in considerable doubt, either of the nature of the apprehended danger, or of the exact point from which it was to proceed. After standing a short time, however, in the attitude of listening, slowly turning his head, as his eyes were keenly searching the woods around him, he hastily started back, and, pointing to a dark thicket nearly abreast of the carriage, leaped nimbly behind a tree, and seemed awaiting some expected result. The next moment, the shrill, quavering sounds of the terrific war-whoop, issuing from the coverts in every direction, announced to the appalled travellers the fearful character of the foe by which they were surrounded. And in another instant, a score of painted savages leaped from the bushes, and, menacingly brandishing their tomahawks aloft, closely invested the carriage. Knowing it would be utterly useless to attempt any resistance, the old veteran put up the pistols, which he had drawn out on the first alarm, and, while the shuddering females, with a terrified glance at the frightful group around them, were burying their faces in their hands, very coolly proceeded, by signs, and such phrases as he supposed might be understood, to signify to his assailants that he yielded himself and family as prisoners. The captors, having ordered out their prisoners into the road, immediately fell to work with their knives, in cutting the harness from the horses, each of which, when released, was mounted by one of the enemy and ridden off into the woods; while the carriage was run into the nearest thicket and concealed. The prisoners, including Neshobee, who, in attempting to escape, had been seized and brought in, were then placed in Indian file, alternately with a sufficient number of their captors to guard the whole, and marched out the road the same way in which their horses had been previously taken, and which soon brought the company into an old, overgrown path, leading through the forest in a westerly direction. In this manner our party were urged forward at a rapid pace for nearly an hour, during which, not a word was uttered by either captors or captured, with the exception of Captain Hendee, whose irritable temper occasionally broke out in a half suppressed anathema as he jarred a rheumatic limb, while hobbling along the rough and frequently obstructed path. At length, to the great and unexpected joy of the wearied captives, the cheering light of an opening broke upon their view, affording hope that the fatigues, under which they were nearly ready to sink, were now to be terminated for the night; and that they were to be favored with quarters in some kind of a house, instead of an unsheltered bed of earth in the wilderness, as they had anticipated The opening, consisting of thirty or forty acres of land, and containing two small log tenements, with a barn of similar construction attached to one of them, was situated along the margin of a pictureesque pond, embedded in a forest of majestic pines On entering the clearing, Captain Hendee instantly perceived from appearances about the cabins, that they had reached the head quarters of the gang who, as he rightly concluded, had taken possession of the place since its desertion by the inhabitants. His horses, that had arrived before him, had beer turned out, and were now quietly grazing in the field; while a large number of the enemy, nearly equalling that of the party who had been engaged in the capture, were scattered about the place, some bathing in the pond, some fishing, some pitching quoits, and others lounging about the buildings. As he approached this portion of the enemy, the Captain soon noticed a difference in the appearance of many of them, as contrasted with that of such of his captors as had come under his inspection, which, with his acquaintance with the peculiar motions and demeanor of the natives, immediately led him to suspect that a considerable part of the band, though painted and habited like Indians, were white men in disguise. And he now readily understood that he was indebted for his present misfortune to the traitor, Remington, who, being secretly connected with this band of Indians and tories, had doubtless been employed by them to bring intelligence of the approach of such families as should be passing along the road; though why his own family should have been thus particularly marked for capture, while others were suffered to escape, it did not at that time occur to him. When our party, with their captors, arrived at the first cabin, which they reached about dark, they were halted at the door, while a consultation was held at some distance aloof between two or three, who appeared to have the control of the band; after which, one of them came forward, and, having first caused Neshobee to be taken to the barn, motioned to the rest of the prisoners, except Miss Hendee, who stood in the rear, to enter the house. Perceiving it was intended to seperate her from her friends, the alarmed maiden suddenly darted by her immediate keepers, and attempted to reach the door at which her father at that moment was entering. A rough hand, however, was instantly extended, and, grasping her arm, rudely pulled her back. `Kill me, if you will,' she exclaimed, `kill me, but let me die with my friends.' 14* `Prisoners can't always be choosers, my proud one,' said the apparent savage in good English. `It is Darrow!' said Alma, with blanching features, and with a look of alarm, which the brandished tomahawk of the Indian had failed to call forth. `I see it all, and know the design. Death I fear not; but such a fate!—Oh! as you value the innocence and eternal peace of you daughter, protect me, my father!' Comprehending the meaning of his daughter, and appreciating all her apprehensions, even before she had done speaking, the maddened father hastily drew a pistol from his pocket, and discharged it full at the head of Darrow. The bullet grazed the temple of the astounded ruffian, and his locks were slightly singed by the burning powder; but he escaped with no other injury. Recovering from the shock of the explosion, he hurriedly pulled out one of the heavy pistols which hung in his belt, raised it to the breast of his unflinching opponent, and, with the look of a fiend, was in the act of taking deliberate aim, when the heroic girl, who was the innocent cause of the strife, suddenly threw herself between her father and the weapon levelled for his destruction. After holding the deadly implement in the same threatening position nearly a minute, as if deliberating whether he would send the bullet through both father and daughter, for the sake of wreaking his vengeance on the former, the balked villain with an angry movement thrust the pistol into its place, and turning to his men, fiercely exclaimed, `Seize the damned old dotard! Secure him, and let him wait for my revenge till I have disposed of this silly jade. She will soon find out, I guess, what she has gained by the rumpus,' he added, again grasping the arm of his recoiling victim, and, regardless of her shrieks, roughly dragging her off to the other cabin; while, in obedience to his orders, his painted minions proceeded, with demoniac glee, to bind the old gentleman, and thrust him with the rest of the prisoners into the house. With the assistance of his men, several of whom he ordered to attend him, Darrow soon succeeded in forcing his half senseless victim to the other cabin, situated on the shore of the pond, near the western extremity of the clearing; when, opening the door, he gave her a spiteful push, which sent her reeling through the entrance, at the same time gruffly exclaiming, `There, madam! there are your quarters for the present. And let me just inform your ladyship, that the less fuss you make about the matter the better it will be for you.' With this he drew the door to, and, after posting a guard round the house, returned to the main body of his band, who were now assembled round the first mentioned house, busily engaged in cooking their suppers in the open air, or patching up the leaky roof of the log barn, to protect those from the threatened storm, who should be compelled to take quarters in it in consequence of the arrangement, which the leaders had seen fit to make, of placing the prisoners in separate houses. After being left alone, Miss Hendee made an effort to regain her composure. And having succeeded in a good degree, she proceeded, by the dim twilight yet remaining, to examine the interior of the house, containing but a single room on the ground floor. Three or four old chairs, a rough pine table, and a straw bed laid upon a rudely constructed bedstead, with a couple of coarse blankets for covering, constituted all the visible furniture of the cabin. With these observations, she seated herself in a chair, and endeavored to think coolly on the novel and alarming situation in which she now found herself placed. From Sherwood's known connection with Darrow, the apparent leader of the present band, she had but little doubt that the former was in fact the commander of these marauders, or at least the instigator of the seizure of herself and family. And in either case, she was at no loss to understand that the possession of her person was the main, if not the only object, of the present capture. Nor did she doubt, for similar reasons, that Sherwood must be near,—probably already on the ground. And from the circumstance of her being seperated from her friends; and confined alone, she felt but too fearfully certain that a fate was in reserve for her, on which, at the best she could hope for, she shuddered to think. After she had remained in this situation awhile, listening to every movement from without, and starting at the sound of every footstep, lest it prove the herald of a visit from Sherwood, which she now every moment expected would be paid her, and to which she looked forward with a dread, that the anticipated presence of no other foe could impart, the door was thrown open, and a man unceremoniously entered. She hastily rose from her seat and threw a look of alarm towards the intruder. A second glance, however, told her that he was not the dreaded visitor, but only one of the disguised tories come to bring her lights and refreshment. Placing the torch which he bore in the chimney, the man silently advanced, and set a trencher of coarse food on the table; after which he turned, and departed, neither questioning nor questioned. Feeling no inclination to taste the food, the hapless girl resumed her seat, and again gave herself up to the distressing thoughts, which her situation was so well calculated to inspire. The last gleams of twilight had now faded away, and night had fallen upon the earth with almost Egyptian darkness. There was a low, rushing sound abroad, betokening an approaching conflict of the elements. The attention of Alma being arrested by these renewed indications of the storm, which, for several hours, appeared to have been slowly concentrating its forces in the distance, she arose and went to a narrow window, that opened upon the dark waters of the forest-girt pond. The omenous sounds before heard had given place to the more audible murmers of the troubled air, which in fitful and variant undulations, now moaned dismally along the ground, and now piped, in brief and broken strains of melancholy music, among the tops of the neighboring pines. Large, black masses of jagged clouds were hurrying through the heavens, which were occasionally made visible by slight, quivering flashes of the electric fires, partially disclosing the broad outlines of the convolving vapor above, and dimly lighting up the dark landscape of wilds and waters beneath. While the maiden was looking abroad upon this scene of gloomy magnificence, which seemed strangely to harmonize with the kindred gloom of her own sad and desolate bosom, a bright, but far off flash gleamed fiercely athwart her vision. Turning her eyes to the quarter whence it proceeded, she beheld a distinct, attenuated, and ribbon-like flame approaching from a distant part of the horizon, and describing in its apparently slow, and crinkling movement, as it came, an arch of fearful splendor across the illuminated heavens. The next instant it fell upon the top of a towering dry pine, standing on the opposite shore of the pond, and hurled the blazing fragments of its giant trunk in every direction over the woods, and far into the hissing and bubbling waters around. A single stunning report followed, and all without was again dark and silent. Recoiling at the shock of the deafening concussion, and almost blinded by the intensity of the flash, the astounded girl turned suddenly from the window, and attempted to grope her way back to her seat. Before reaching it, however, a slight noise within the room arrested her steps. Pressing her hand upon her eyes an instant to enable her to discern the objects in the dimly lighted apartment, she sent an apprehensive glance towards the door, when, to her unspeakable dismay, she encountered the basilisk eyes of Sherwood, who was quietly standing, within the entrance, and looking upon her with an expression, in which guilt, effrontery and triumph, were singularly blended. `Leave me!' she exclaimed, as the other now began to advance towards her; `leave me, sir!' she repeated with all the firmness and decision of manner she could command, while she gradually retreated to the opposite side of the room. `Why should I leave you, captious girl,' he responded in his usual affectedly meek and plausible manner, `why should I leave you, or you desire it, when I am the only friend to whom you, or your family, can look for intercession with those into whose power you have fallen? Having heard of your misfortune, I hastened immediately to the spot, and have but this moment arrived.' `Base dissembler!' said Alma, with an indignation which, for the instant, seemed to overpower every other feeling, `will you pretend, sir, that these are not all your doings?' `Why—why, I admit,' he replied, considerably disconcerted at the question and pointed manner of the other, which led him to suppose that she had by some means received a much more certain knowledge of his connection with the band than she really had; `I admit that these men belong to a company which I have a commission to command. But I protest I have had nothing to do with your capture. And why should you always be imputing to me the worst motives for every action I may perform? Here, now, I come to befriend and save you; and you receive me only with insults!' `I will put the sincerity of your professions to the test, sir,' promptly rejoined the other. `If you really came to befriend me, and have the power, as you admit, let me go instantly to my father and friends.' `Why the time has arrived, it strikes me, when I am under no very particular necessity of being further dictated,' sneeringly replied the villian, now throwing off the mask, which he perceived was serving him but little purpose. `I have a certain condition to propose, and when you comply with that, neither you nor your family are longer prisoners.' The heart of the wretched girl sunk within her, but she made no reply. `You have not forgotten, probably.' resumed the the other, `our late interview, when I proposed the fulfilment of a long settled engagement?—Well, if you have, I have not, not the manner in which my overtures were then treated. But notwithstanding all the scorn and abuse I have received both from you and your father, I still feel disposed to allow you a chance to fulfil that engagement, which, as a prisoner, and in my power, is more than you could reasonably expect. I am still willing to make you my legal wife; but it must be done on the spot. I have a clergyman within call to perform the ceremony. Will you consent?' `Never!' replied the indignant and yet unconquered girl. `What! consent under such circumstances—under the menaces here held forth, and the feelings here exhibited?—I would as soon unite myself to a fiend! consent to such a mockery, intended only to disguise violence and outrage, under the sacred rite of marriage? Never! While death can be my alternative, O, never!' `But supposing death cannot be your alternative, you foolish girl?' said the miscreant suitor in a taunting tone: `You will do well, perhaps, to bear in mind that your person is already in my power; and that I am the one to name your alternative. And I shall name one too, in which I shall be likely to dispense with the services of the parson.' “Monster!' exclaimed the aroused maiden, with an energy which insulted virtue alone could have excited, `begone with your polluting presence, lest the thunders of Heaven, which are now angrily rolling over our heads, strike you to the earth in vengeance for your meditated villanies!' With all the innate baseness and disguised effrontery of his nature, Sherwood could not help quailing under the withering scorn and almost unearthly majesty which accompanied this bold rebuke; and unable to summon the hardihood to proceed any further at present, he turned towards the door, muttering as he went, `Well, we will soon see who is to be balked this time! Two hours,' he added, pausing at the thresh-hold and looking back, without, however, venturing to raise his eyes to the face of the other, who still stood fearlessly confronting him,—`just two hours shall be allowed you to conclude which of the two alternatives you will embrace, and in making up your mind, you may as well take into consideration, that your father attempted the life of my lieutenant, who will require such an inducement as I alone can offer him, to make him relinquish his purpose of revenge.' After the fisrt glad and grateful sensations of relief, which came over the feelings of our heroine on being freed from the dreaded presence of her relentless persecutor, had passed away, all the moral energy, that had sustained her through her fearful trial, forsook her, while, with it, her overstrained nerves, which so powerful an excitement had braced for the exigency, gave way; and weak, exhausted and despairing, she tottored across the room and throwing herself upon the miserable pallet, yielded herself up, for a while, to the dread certainties of a fate, which now even ever-flattering hope could suggest no way of escaping. For her family she felt no great apprehonsions of any fate much more severe then that which usually falls to the lot of ordinary prisoners; since the present contest, as she was aware, had so far been conducted, wherever the Indians had been employed, on altogether different principles from the preceding wars in this country. And contenting themselves with plunder, the savages had 15 generally, on making prisoners, delivered them over unharmed to their white allies, when such only as had been found in arms were retained, while the rest, especially females and the young and aged, were soon dismissed for their homes. Nor could she believe that either Darrow or Sherwood really intended, as they had threatened, to make her father an exception for an act, which, however hasty it might have been, had resulted in no injury. But all these considerations could, in her present peculiar situation, be of no avail to herself. An immediate escape, or some sudden rescue, were apparently the only means of snatching her from the impending doom. And yet how were either of these to be effected? Any attempt to get from the house, guarded as it was by pested sentries, the sound of whose footsteps frequently reached her ear, she knew would be utterly useless. Equally futile also must be the hope of any rescue till long after her fate would be decided. No other resource, therefore, remained to her but to face the danger, as terrible as it was to her, even in the least abhorrent of the alternatives which had been set before her, and persevere in the determination she had already announced of resistance unto death. And she earnestly besought the great protector of the innocent and injured, to arm her with strength and fortitude to meet the coming trial, or interfere, in his mercy, to save her from its terrors and perils. While the mind of the almost frantic girl was thus painfully engrossed, as she was reclining on the bed with her face buried in the clothes, a noise, differing from any thing she had before heard, and proceeding from some point above, but seemingly neither exactly within nor without the building, had several times reached her ear. And now it became too distinct not to attract her particular notice. Startled, though as yet not seriously alarmed, she hastily rose, and endeavored to ascertain the nature of the sounds that had disturbed her. The rain, which had now for some time been heavily pouring to the earth, had extinguished the fire, and, while utter darkness pervaded the room, nothing was to be heard but the ceaseless roar of the descending torrents. At length, however, the noise was repeated. It appeared to proceed from the flue of the chimney, down which, it soon became evident, that something, possessing life and motion, was slowly and cautiously descending into the room; but whether it was a man, or wild beast, she was unable to determine. Presently the mysterious object seemed to reach the hearth. And, in a short time, the dark outlines of a seemingly shapeless figure became discernable to the perplexed, and now thoroughly frightened maiden. Her excited imagination instantly took wing, and in the bewilderment of the moment, the motionless object swelled into a ferocious monster, preparing to clutch her in his horrid embrace. A strange feeling of undefined fear and dread took possession of her bosom, and seemed to paralyze all her faculties. She tried to speak, but could utter no sound—to move, but her limbs refused to do their office; while a peculiar, cold, curdling sensation, commencing with the crown of her head, settled over her, converting her whole system into a helpless, inanimate and frozen mass, alike incapable of thought and action. At that instant a vivid flash of lightning lit up the room with the brightness of the noon-day's sun, and broke the spell that had so strangely enthralled her senses: for, equally to her joy and surprise, she beheld, in the object of her alarm, no other than her faithful friend Neshobee, who, uncertain whether the room might not contain some of the enemy as well as his mistress, whom he knew to be confined here, had squatted in the fire place, after his descent, with the view of ascertaining the fact before he should speak or advance. `Umph!' uttered the Indian, apparently nearly as much relieved as his mistress, at the mutual disclosure. `Missus Alma speak very no loud,' he continued, in a half whisper, as he glided noiselessly forward to her side, and laid his hand on her arm in token of caution. `Them three tory, what stand for watch, all gone fore side for get out of the rain, and so no see Neshobee climb up back side and come down chimney. But Missus talk soft, them stand close up side, hark um, hear um, catch um Neshobee.' `How fares it with my father and the girls—are they still in the other house, and yet unharmed?' eagerly whispered Alma. `All um there. Them tory and Indian all in the barn when the rain come. Leak down, make um jump, crowd thick, so no see Neshobee creep away. Me go back side tother house, peep through crack, see um there when flash come bright. Cappen hands all tie tight. Him look sorry. Three tother girls lay on straw in corner—cry much—all look very scare.' `And what is to become of us, Neshobee,' asked Alma, mournfully, as she brushed away a tear, elicited by the Indian's brief, but graphic and touching description of the situation of her friends. `Neshobee no get in there for help Cappen and them. But me help Missus Alma up chimney, get out, and they no hear so long the rain pour hard.' `No, no, Neshobee, it is impossible,' replied Alma, after reflecting a moment on the proposal of her friend, who had run such risks to rescue her. Could I succeed in getting out upon the house, my light dress, if nothing else, would betray us to the guards, and we should both be taken. And even could I escape, how could I withstand an exposure all night in the woods to this dreadful storm? No, Neshobee, leave me to my fate, which will probably be decided long before you can be the means of our rescue. But my poor father and the girls you may perhaps be instrumental in saving. Then go, Neshobee.—If you succeed in escaping from this place, proceed directly to our army at Ticonderoga, and tell them that we are prisoners to Sherwood and Darrow, with a band of tories and Indians. Tell Colonel Warrington, or Captain Selden, that father's life is threatened—that I—O, heavens! but let my situation be passed over. And should they send a force to deliver us, as I know they will, you can guide it to the spot. Now don't hesitate to leave me, my faithful friend,—to leave me to the care of Heaven,' she added, laying her hand on the other's shoulder and gently pushing him towards the avenue by which he descended into the room. `Don't delay an instant. Go, and I will ask the blessing of a good Providence to speed you on your way.' `Me go,' laconically responded the native, vanishing from the sight of his mistress in the darkness. and silently ascending the chimney. After anxiously listening a few moments to the cautious egress of her messenger, and satisfying herself that he had reached the ground, and escaped undiscovered, *15 the unhappy girl once more returned to her homely couch,—not there, however, to find repose, or any alleviation of the woes that so deeply oppressed her feelings. The distracting apprehensions, from which her mind had been in some measure diverted by the presence of her humble friend, now, on his departure, returned with ten-fold force to her mind. And a feeling of utter loneliness and desolation took possession of her desponding bosom. Conscious that the time set by Sherwood for his return, to execute one of the dreadful alternatives with which he had brutally menaced her, was now nearly at hand, and her feelings becoming, at the maddening thought, too intense to permit her to remain longer quiet, she arose, and again took her station at the little window. The storm cloud still girt darkly and heavily the whole visible horizon; and the elements were in fearful commotion. The howling of the blast, as it swept over the vexed wilderness, attended by the crash of falling trees, the deep, but varying roar of the deluging torrents of wind-driven rain, and loud over all, the terrific peals of bursting thunder, preceded by flashes of lightning that seemed to envelope earth and heaven in a blaze, came mingling on the senses in awful tumult. And yet the scene, as awful as it was, and would have been to her under ordinary circumstances, had no terrors for the wretched captive now;—nay, as the forked lightnings were leaping from cloud to cloud, and darting to the earth in terrific gambols around her, she felt a strange pleasure in their fearful proximity. And regarding them as the instruments of Heaven, which might, perhaps, be commissioned for her deliverance, she often, during that dreadful hour, under the wild impulses of maidenly terror and despair, with which the recurring thoughts of her situation filled her, involuntarily stretched forth her hand towards the deeply charged clouds, as if to invoke the fatal shaft to descend, and snatch her from a doom to which death were a boon of mercy. But that Heaven to which she was looking to relieve her thus, had reserved her for another fate: the storm rolled heavily away, and left her beauteous form unscathed. The rain at length ceased; and the lightnings, as they played along the black parapet of clouds, that lay piled in the east, shone with less dazzling fierceness, and only to show the ravages which the tempest had left behind. As mute and desponding, the lovely captive stood with her eyes still vacantly riveted on the receding storm, she, during the continuance of a bright and lingering flash of lightning, cast her eye obliquely towards the quarters of her enemies, when she caught a glimpse of a man picking his way along the half flooded path leading to her cabin, whom she instantly recognized to be the dreaded Sherwood. A deadly sickness came over her, her brain begun to whirl, and she sunk senseless on the floor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “For freedom's battle once begun. Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son Tho' baffled of is ever won.” While the incidents last described were transpiring, an event occurred, which spread consternation and alarm over all the neighboring country. This was, the unexpected evacuation of the important fortress of Ticonderoga, to which the Americans seemed to have confidently looked as a barrier which was to interpose an effectual check to the further progress of Burgoyne in that quarter. But whatever may have been said of the remissness of General St. Clair, in suffering the enemy, to gain these advantages which compelled him, for the salvation of his army, to evacuate that post, and whatever disasters were immediately occasioned by the movement, the final consequences which resulted from the event proved highly auspicious to the American arms: For while it inspired the British General with an undue confidence of success, and caused him to push rashly into the heart of the country, it at once aroused the Americans from the apathy, with which they seemed to have viewed the approach of the invading army, and kindled up the flagging spirit of patriotism to a pitch of enthusiasm that soon brought the rallying bands of the hardy yeomen of the north to the post of danger, and led to that series of brilliant achievements which terminated in the entire overthrow of this formidable array of British power. Scarcely had St. Clair succeeded, under cover of darkness, in reaching the eastern shore of the lake, and getting his army in motion for the interior, before an active pursuit was commenced by General Frazier with a large detachment of British regulars, followed by General Reidesel with most of the Brunswick forces. The Americans, however, kept some miles in advance of the enemy through the day; and St. Clair, with the main body of his troops, pushed forward that night as far as Castleton, leaving the rear guard of the army, consisting of about a thousand men, under the command of Colonel Warrington, on the road some distance behind, where he encamped at a farm-house within three miles of the place which was the same night occupied by the lawless gang of Sherwood and their unfortunate captives, all parties being equally ignorant of their vicinity to each other. With this glance at the situation of our army, with whose movements were more or less closely linked the destines of all those whose individual fortunes we have undertaken to follow, we will now go on with our tale, which the crowding events of the next twenty-four hours were destined to bring to its catastrophe. And leaving our fair and persecuted captive in the happy state of insensibility, in which we last described her, we will now follow her trusty messenger on his adventurous way to the American army, which both he and his mistress supposed was still posted at Ticonderoga, some twenty miles distant. Happily succeeding in leaving the cabin and gaining an adjoining field undiscovered by the guards, Neshobee, after stopping a moment to pitch his course, plunged directly into the tangled and dripping wilderness lying along the northern borders of the pond. Pausing at every considerable interval of darkness, that still almost impenetrably shrouded the earth, and darting forward by the views which the fast flashing lightning afforded, he treaded the difficult mazes of the forest with a rapidity rarely attainable by any but natives of the wilds. Passing round the western extremity of the pond, and bending his course in a more southerly direction, an hour's travelling brought him to the great military road leading directly to the lake. The storm having now ceased, he hastily stripped off his drenched garments, wrung out the water to enable him to run with more expedition, reinvested himself, and again set off at a long trot down the road towards his supposed destination. It was to be his fortune, however, to travel but a short part of the distance for which he had prepared himself: For after proceeding about a mile along the now unobstructed way with a speed to which his foverish anxiety lent wings, he came to a large opening, which presented the unexpected appearance of numerous dimly burning fires scattered through an extensive field. Stopping short at a spectacle so unusual under the present circumstances, the cautious native immediately put his ear to the earth, and listened long and intently. A low, mingled hum, as of a hushed and reposing multitude, rose in a searce perceptible murmer on the air; and soon the slight jar of measured footsteps, resembling the distant tread of slowly pacing sentinels, became distinguishable to his acute senses. No longer doubting the presence of an encamped army in the opening, but wholly ignorant of its character, he cautiously crept forward, rising, from time to time, to discover if possible, without exposing himself, whether it was a friendly or hostile force, which he had thus unexpectedly encountered. Keeping within the range of a stump, or some object by the road-side, to screen his approach, he crawled along about a dozen rods, and again paused for a more careful observation. The clouds were now rapidly breaking away, and, in the increasing light, he was soon enabled to trace the outlines of a sentry, standing motionless as a post in the middle of the road, but a few rods ahead. While he thus lay tasking his vision to discover something in the dress, arms, or appearance of the man, from which the fact he sought to know might be inferred, the waning moon shone out through the parting clouds, and disclosed to the startled Indian the British uniform of the sentry, and at the same time the numerous tents of the enemy dotting the fields in the distance beyond. The first thought of Nehobee, on making this alarming discovery, was to secure a retreat from this dangerous vicinity to the sentinel, though he was wholly at a loss what course he should now take to find those to whom he had been dispatched for succour. But his doubts in this respect were set at rest by information he the next moment obtained from an unexpected quarter: For while he lay anxiously watching a cloud that was nearing the moon, and promised in a few moments again to obscure her light, which now made it hazzardous for him to move from his position, a soldier approached to relieve the one on guard. `Well, Tom,' said the soldier just arrived, `you have had a devil of a drenching this bout, hav'nt you?—Why! what! has the man turned to stone? Say, Tom, why dont you answer me?' `O, yes, yes,' replied the other arousing himself from his stupor—`yes, wet enough—a ghastly time I've had of it, Jerry, since I've been out here. Hang me, if I hav'nt got quite enough of this chasing the Yankees into the bush. I wish 'twas over. But do you know the orders for to-morrow?' `Why, to chase the d—n'd rebels till we take them, besure. Our Captain has just returned from General Frazier's quarters; and he says they have had a sort of go between, by the name of Remington, who came directly from the Yankee camp, and brought word, that the main body of the rebels have got about ten miles ahead, while a regiment or two, under a Colonel Warrington, are encamped within a league of us on the road. And the plan is, I believe, to move on, at daylight, to the attack of the nearest force. And if the main body return to the rescue, why, we have General Reidesel, with a plenty of Hessians, a few miles behind, to back us: so very likely we may get a tolerable bush fight out of it, before it is over, particularly as this Warrington, they say, is a fellow of grit; and his men are mostly Green Mountain Boys, who have more of the regular built bull dog about 'em than any thing the Yankees have got in their ragamuffin army.' `Well, Jerry,' replied the other, in accents partaking somewhat of the doleful. `I cant exactly tell how tis, but if we do have a battle, I have a notion I shan't live through it.' `Why what makes you think so, Tom?' `O, I don't know—I feel it creeping over me; and that ain't all, I am very sartain—deed, I could swear to it—that I saw a shape out there in the road yonder, a little while ago, that rose up right out of the ground, and then kinder stood quivering a minute, and vanished. I expect it was my spirit, Jerry,' `Pooh! man, your liver must have got water soaked here in the rain, to make you down in the mouth about such whimsies. Here, take a suck at my canteen.—There! now back to your tent, your pluck will be up by morning.' Animated by the cheering intelligence he had gathered from the conversation above detailed, every word of which had reached his attentive ears, the native slowly and noiselessly withdrew from the spot in the now favoring darkness, till fairly beyond the sight and hearing of the guard; when he began rapidly to retrace his way along the road towards the American encampment, to which we will now repair in anticipation of his arrival. It was a calm and cloudless morning that ushered in the day so long remembered in Vermont for the sanguinary conflict of Hubbardton, which proved so destructive to the boastful and haughty foe, while it widely scattered the weeds of wo throughout her infant settlement.[3] [3] There was no engagement in our revolution, perhaps, which exhibited such determined energy and resolution on the part of the Americans as the battle of Hubbardton; and yet there was no one, of which the results are more obscurely or incorrectly stated by our leading historians,—most of them making our loss from 200 to 300 and that of the British from 100 to 200. But if they had reversed the statement, they would not even then have done justice to our gallant troops. Ethan Allen, in his narative says: “Our loss was about 30 killed, and that of the enemy amounted to 300 killed including a Major Grant. The enemy's loss I learnt from the corfession of their own officers, when a prisoner among them. I heard, them likewise complain that the Green Mountain Boys “took sight.” After a diligent enquiry I am satisfied that Colonel Allen's statement is substantially a correct one. The sun had just burst over the long range of eastern mountains, whose broad empurpled sides lay looming in the distance, and a thousand sparkling exhalations were rising from the storm beaten encampment of the Green Mountain Boys. 16 Though deeply worn and fatigued by the forced march of the previous day, and drenched to the skin through the night, yet the troops were already in motion, eagerly engaged in preparing themselves for whatever emergency might follow, and while hastily snatching their morning's repast, many an eye was turned anxiously towards the quarters of their gallant commander, where it was understood a council of war was being held to determine whether to continue their flight after the main army, or remain to give battle to the pursuing enemy. At length the officers were seen emerging from the quarters in question, and with quickened steps returning to their respective corps, while the increased activity which succeeded throughout the camp indicated the importance of the result now communicated. `Well, Captain Selden,' said Warrington, as rousing himself from the reverie into which he had fallen after the council had broken up, he looked around and observed that his confidential friend now remained with him in the apartment, `what do you think of the argument of Hale, and those who so strenuously opposed our proposition of making a stand against the enemy?' `Quite as well of their arguments as their patriotism, Colonel,' promptly answered the person addressed. `Shakespeare never better evinced his knowledge of the human heart than when he put into the mouth of one of his secretly craven boasters the salvo argument that “discretion is the better part of valour.”' `The inference is a sharp one, Captain, but I fear me, too well deserved. There was one thing, however, which gratified me:—not a single officer from the Green Mountains opposed the proposition. And it is so with the troops of my regiment: I was out among them this morning, by daylight, to gather their feelings on this subject; and though the poor fellows were wet, weary and war-worn, I found our Green Mountain Boys universally burning for the encounter.' `There is no doubt of it. But after all, Colonel, I fear these preachers of prudence were prophesying by instinct, when they told us we had a bloody day's work before us. The force we are sure to encounter is perhaps, more than double our own; and we know not how many more are on their way to reinforce them.' `I am aware of all this. But as soldiers can we longer endure the thought of being driven before the foe?—as citizens and settlers of these our mountain homes, can we see the enemy marching into the heart of our country, and strike no blow for its protection? As little as the people expected our evacuation of Ticonderoga, much less will they expect us to continue a flight, which will soon leave the whole settlement exposed to the ravages of the merciless minions of Burgoyne. With my own regiment alone, I can make a successful stand against the force which immediately menaces us with an attack; and if more arrive, the reinforcements which St. Clair will surely send us, when our express shall reach him, will be in season for the rescue.' `Gen. St. Clair may send us a reinforcement, but'— `May? he must! And if he does, and will send another force round into the rear to cut off the enemy's retreat, they are all ours before sunset. Think you Ethan Allen would be found longer skulking before the foe, or, if in St. Clair's command, would suffer a man of them to return to the lake alive, or uncaptured?' `Never! but Ethan Allen is not our general. And the man who suffered the enemy to get possession of every commanding post round Ticonderoga till we had good reason to evacuate, may still, like some of his humble imitators in our council just now, think it prudent to take care of himself, and leave us to do the same.' At this moment the sergeant of the guard entered the door. `Colonel,' said he, `we have taken a prisoner this morning, who came from the direction of the enemy; and though he professes fair, and pretends business with you, yet having no pass, or papers of any kind, and refusing to give any further account of himself, we have kept him under guard, till we thought you might have leisure to examine him.' `What is he,—a British soldier?' `No—an Indian, or part Indian, I should think.' `Bring him here, instantly,' said Warrington, with an expression of interest. The sergeant accordingly left the apartment, and in a few moments returned with Neshobee by his side, when, upon an intimation from his superior, he withdrew, leaving his prisoner and the two officers by themselves. `Neshobee, my good fellow,' exclaimed Warrington, advancing to the native, and shaking him cordially by the hand, `I hope they have not misused you; but how came you here?' `Me come for purpose find you. Misses Alma'— `Alma Hendee! where is she?' eagerly interrupted the Colonel. The Indian then related to his astonished auditors, in his peculiar manner, the particulars of the capture of the Hendee family, and all of the subsequent occurrences which had come to his knowledge till he reached the American encampment. `Execrable villain!' exclaimed Warrington with unusual bitterness, after a few questions and answers respecting the number and equipment of Sherwood's gang had been rapidly exchanged between the excited officers and the native, `execrable villain! but his triumph shall be a short one!' `God grant it!' responded Selden with the same spirit, `but what do you propose, Colonel?' `To proceed instantly to their camp, storm it, and rescue the captives within this hour—if possible, within this very hour!' `And you are willing to risk, even at this emergency, the absence of men enough to accomplish it?' `I must,—as much as we may need them, I must risk it. And would to God, that my duties would permit me to head them, against this farrago of fiends incarnate.—Will you perform the service, Captain Selden?' `Most joyfully.' `Go, then. Take your company, including Jones and as many of his scouts as you think best. If you succeed, furnish the family with an escort to a place of safety, or bring them to the rear of the army, as circumstances shall dictate.—Stay, Selden, a moment,' he continued approaching the side of the spirited and impatient young officer, and speaking in a low confidential tone, `I am well aware that this may be a day of danger—of death, to many of us— Tell that lovely girl her frank and noble explanation has been received and appreciated—that my heart 16* has ever been, and is now doubly hers—that if I survive, I will soon be by her side, and if I fall, my last thoughts will be upon her.' At that instant the quickly successive reports of a dozen muskets in the direction of the expected enemy broke the stillness of the morning, announcing a collision between the opposing outposts, and the battle at hand. `To arms!' exclaimed the commander, rushing out into the open air, and leaping upon his charger, that caparisoned and ready for his gallant rider stood impatiently pawing the ground at the door, `to arms, instantly to arms!' As the loud, and thrilling tones of the well known voice of their idolized leader rung through the camp, falling upon the ears of the aroused and excited troops, every man sprang for his musket, and the busy quiet, that one moment before had reigned through the tented lines, was at once changed into the noisy din of preparation. Captain Selden, in accordance with the arrangement just settled between him and his superior, hastily formed his company, briefly informed his men of the object of their proposed expedition, and, amidst the clangor of rattling steel and rolling drums, mingled with the stern, brief words of command, filed off rapidly across the field towards the northern forest, and, with Neshobee as guide, soon disappeared within its borders. Let us now return to the captured. The first object that saluted the eyes of our hapless heroine, on recovering her consciousness, was the dimly seen figure of Sherwood standing in the door-way, in the attitude of one whose attention on entering had been suddenly arrested by some unexpected sight or sound behind him. The next instant a man on horseback came dashing up furiously to the spot. Hastily closing the door behind him, Sherwood immediately advanced to the side of the halted horseman; when the following dialogue distinctly reached the ears of the eager listener within. `Captain Sherwood—ain't it?' `Yes—Remington, I believe, from the voice?— Well, what news?' `Important—great—glorious!' `Aha, what is it?' `The Rebels have evacuated Ti.' `The devil! and all escaped?' `Every scoundrel of them, but their race is nearly up.' `Why? How? Where are they?' `St. Clair, with the bulk of them made shift to push on to Castleton by dark,—Warrington with a regiment or two, now lies encamped at Seleck's farm, right against us over on the military road. Gen. Frazier, who followed hard on their tracks through the day, lies at Lacy's Camp, with his brigade; and Red Hazle and his Jarmans are but a few miles behind.' `And what is Frazier's plan?' `To move upon Warrington at daylight; and he told me to tell you to be on hand when the attack is made,—flank the rebels in the woods, and keep on ahead of them to cut off their retreat. But the order need'nt interfere with your business here,' added the traitor, with a knowing chuckle, pointing towards the house with one hand, and giving his master a significant nudge with the other:—There's no need of your marching before break of day; so you see you'll have time to'— `Hush! speak lower, you prying devil,—she'll hear you.' `Well, well; but what is to be my share for this night's job?' `British gold,—Burgoyne will see to that.' `Yes, I know that; but I mean what share of the same kind of coin that you are about to make free with?—You understand me, hey?' `That's asking more than you have any right to expect, Remington.' `The hell it is! I know there is game to be had, and if I can't have my share, when my betters are helping themselves, I'll know the reason why, by'— `Yes, but don't get in a passion about it: Something of the kind may be effected for you, perhaps. The Scotch girl is promised to Darrow; but there are two maids. It can be managed, possibly'— `To night?' `Why—why, not very conveniently—if you will delay it till to morrow night—but hush! hush! who is that?—who is that coming in such haste?'— hurriedly exclaimed Sherwood, as startled by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps, he looked round and distinguished the figure of some one hastily making his way towards them. `It is the lieutenant's gait,' observed Remington, whose situation on his horse enabled him best to determine the point in question. `And it is Darrow, too, ain't it?' `Yes, I am the chap,' responded the ruffian striding up to the spot. `Where is the Captain?—O here! Jake, the devil is to pay?' `What is the matter?' eagerly asked Sherwood. `Why, it may be matter enough for us soon, if what Remington here says about the rebels being so near us, is true—Hendee's cursed Indian has escaped!' `Hell and furies! Bill, who suffered that?' `The lubberly curse that you set to guard the red scamp in the corner of the barn got asleep, I spose; and the confusion and crowding caused by the storm prevented any one else from seeing to it.' `How long has he been gone?' `These two hours, for aught I can ascertain.' `Did you see any thing that could be taken for the imp, on your route, Remington?' `No Captain. As soon as I found the rebels were on the road, I rode several miles round, in by-roads, to reach the British camp.' `Well, Darrow, we must move,' said Sherwood after musing a moment: `I know that fellow well. He will know what to do without being told, and will be as cunning as Satan in bringing it about. In beating about for help to rescue the family, he will learn Warrington's position, which ten to one he has reached before this. You, as well as I, can guess what will come next. Within an hour, a hundred of Warrington's bull dogs may be upon us, with ambuscades in every direction around us. We must march, and that instantly. Our private plans, Bill, must be deferred till another night. And, by that time, I am thinking, there wont be enough left of the damned scoundrel, or his men, to trouble us. We will take to the hill on the south end of the pond yonder. The moon is coming out; and this breeze will shake the water from the trees, so that we can make our way comfortably. Go forward, Darrow, and be mustering the men. Remington, let me mount that horse, till we enter the woods. Guards! ho! you may close up round the house now, and in a few moments we will relieve you of your charge.' If ever an offering of unfeigned, unmingled gratitude ascended to Heaven from the lips of mortals for boon bestowed, it was that of Alma Hendee, as on bended knees she poured out the incense of her gushing and grateful heart to her divine Preserver for this temporary deliverance from the perils that so nearly threatened her. She had scarcely risen from her devotions, when a messenger from Sherwood's quarters entered, and summoned her to attend him to the other cabin. She obeyed with cheerful alacrity, and, in a few moments more, was in the silent embrace of her friends, receiving the low murmurred caresses and blessings of her overjoyed father, on whose bosom she lay sobbing till interrupted by the stern, harsh voice of Darrow at the door, commanding them all to come forth, to be taken along with the band in the movement which had been so hastily concerted by the alarmed leaders! On emerging from the house the prisoners found the entire band of their captors drawn up in the yard, waiting only to receive them before commencing the contemplated march. And, after the former had been ordered to take their places near the centre of the line, separated from each other by the alternate intermingling of guards as on the afternoon's march, the whole moved silently forward across the pasture in the direction previously mentioned by their leader. When they arrived at the outskirts of the clearing, Sherwood relinquished the horse, upon which he had thus far superintended the march, to Remington, and, after sending off the latter on some secret destination, took his station at the head of his forces, and plunged directly into the forest. After many windings through the pathless and still dripping woods, for the purpose of confusing or misleading their enemies, in any attempts which might be made to follow the trail, they bore down towards the pond, and soon struck into an old Indian path running along the margin of the water towards the south. In this they slowly pursued their dark, and often difficult way, till day-light; when arriving at the southern extremity of the pond, and being here, as they believed, out of the reach of any immediate danger from pursuit, they withdrew a short distance from the vicinity of the water, and halted to wait the operations of the hostile armies, being now within a short distance of the clearing in which the action was expected to take place. After scouts had been despatched to watch the movements of Warrington's forces, and some time spent in inspecting their arms, and preparing them for instant service, the band, at the intimation of their leaders, proceeded to partake of a hasty repast, consisting mostly of bread and dried meats, which each produced from his own knapsack, with the exception of the officers and captives, for the supplying of whom one of Captain Hendee's horses, loaded with provisions and tent-cloths, had followed in the rear. A scanty portion of this kind of food, with a gourd-shell of water, was, after a while, sent to the faint and wearied prisoners by Sherwood, who seemed studiously to avoid coming himself into their immediate presence. The meal was partaken by the captives in gloomy silence, which, except here and there in the ribald jest of a tory, or the low guttural grunt of a savage, was imitated by the mongrel gang of ferocious and brutal looking fellows around them. Scarcely had they finished their homely repast, when a rattling peal of distant musketry, followed by the sound of rolling drums furiously beating to arms, came booming through the forest, awakening the echoes of hill and dell for miles around, and startling both captives and captors by the sound, now well understood by all as the herald of the approaching conflict. `To the hills! forward to a station on the hills!' loudly shouted Sherwood, now for the first time openly exercising the command in the presence of the prisoners. Hastily forming a line of march, Sherwood, with quick and eager steps led his men up the ragged steeps towards his proposed station, leaving the brutal Darrow, who had charge of the rear, in which the captives were now placed, to goad on the infirm old captain, and the tender, and already exhausted females, to keep pace with the rest. After a rapid and fatiguing march of half an hour, at almost every step of which the forest around them was resounding to the roar of the thickening conflict on the plains to the right, they reached the summit of a wood covered hill, which overlooked the extensive opening to the west, now occupied as the scene of action by the contending armies. Immediately detaching about a dozen of his most trusty tories with Darrow at their head to guard the prisoners, Sherwood, with the remainder of his force, proceeded some forty or fifty rods down the hill, and took his station in the bushes bordering the opening, to wait a favorable opportunity to co-operate with his British friends. The guard, on the departure of Sherwood, wishing to take a stand themselves where they could witness the battle, ordered the captives forward to the brow of the hill, and permitted them to take seats upon the edge of a cliff which afforded them, through the openings of the overhanging foliage, a distinct view of the field of conflict. A grand and thrilling spectacle now burst upon their view. At the distance of less than a mile, in the broad field beneath them, stood the plain and hardy sons of liberty, unflinchingly engaged face to face, and often arm to arm, in deadly strife with the gorgeous and disciplined bands of their outnumbering foes,— the fluttering standards and glittering arms of wheeling squadrons now flashing in the morning sun, and now enveloped in clouds of eddying smoke, as the fires of a thousand death-tubes blazed fiercely along the opposing lines; while hill and forest around seemed rocking responsive to the deafening thunders of the embattled plain. With an interest equally intense, but with emotions widely different, was the scene witnessed by the little group of captives: for while Alma and Jessy gazed in silent awe upon the fearful spectacle, trembling and amazed at the tremendous din that rose from the spot, and with bosoms painfully beating with secret anxiety for the fate of their betrothed lovers, engaged, as they believed, in the hottest of the strife, and exposed every instant to the missiles of death, or already weltering in their gore among the dying and dead,— while, with such agitating emotions gazed they upon the scene, Captain Hendee watched the progress of the contest with the experienced eye of a soldier, and with a view to its general results. For nearly an hour the battle raged with unmitigated fury. Alternately driving and driven, the contending foes, 17 without any permanent advantage to either, fiercely disputed for the mastery of the field; while volley after volley, bursting in rapid succession along the serried lines of the opposing fronts, continued to sweep the plain with the leaden tempest, covering it with heaps of the dying and the dead. At length there was a momentary lull in the din of battle. Even the `stormy music' of the shriek-drowning drum for an instant ceased to send up its monotonous roar from the field of conflict. And all beneath the broad and veiling cloud of smoke, that hung over the spot, at first seemed as silent as if that cloud had been a pall for an army of the dead. The next moment, however, a sound reached the quick ears of the female captives more fearful than the thunders of battle. `List! what is that?' asked the girls, with a simultaneous exclamation, and looks of horror, as the piercing and mingled wail of many voices came wafting on the breeze with awful distinctness to the ear. `Oh, father, what dreadful sound is that?' repeated Alma, with a shudder. The old gentleman, whose less acute organs had not been affected by the sound, without replying, turned an ear towards the fatal field. The same hideous, though low and distance-mellowed screech, came up again from the spot with the succeeding undulation of the fitful breeze, but was the next instant lost in a fresh burst of martial music, which once more sent its swelling roar over the surrounding hills. `It is the cries of the wounded!' said the Captain, turning to his unheeding auditors, for they sat with their hands tightly pressed upon their ears to exclude the abhorrent sound. `But it is over—it is over now,' he continued, motioning them to withdraw their hands. Understanding the gesture rather than the words, the girls hesitatingly unstopped their ears, and turned a mute and startled look of enquiry upon the Captain. `It was the groans of the wounded,' resumed the Captain. `It is, indeed, a dreadful sound to one not inured to the horrors of war. The first time I ever heard it, I well remember, it made my hair rise upright on my head, and filled me with more terror and dread than the bullets of the enemy. But it does not often occur, and should never, as it disheartens the men; yet it will sometimes happen when some sudden change in the order of battle is taking place on both sides at the same moment.' `And do you suspect any important change is about to take place in the present battle, father?' anxiously enquired Alma. `I do, child. I can perceive there is a movement going on among our troops. There! do you see that officer dashing at full speed along the lines, as he occasionally appears in the openings of the lifting smoke? He is is rallying and forming for a fresh onset, and is probably the chief in command, who you understood was to be'— `It is! is he!' exclaimed Alma, with trembling eagerness. `Yes, it is he, and yet spared, thank Heaven!' she added, checking herself, and sinking her voice into an almost inaudible whisper, `but Oh! the perils which the next moment may surround him!' and she buried her face in her hands to conceal her emotion. `Well, whether Warrington or another,' observed the Captain, `the officer in command there is winning glory for himself and his country. I have never seen a defence against a superior force conducted with more ability than he has displayed, nor a field disputed with more determined intrepidity than this by the men under him; at least by all those who have yet engaged. But there is one battalion standing aloof by the copse, yonder, whose movements I neither understand nor like. I wonder who they are?' `That is Colonel Hale's regiment,' said a voice from the rear, `we have no great fears of him, or his men; but them dare-devils in the thickest of it, there, are Green Mountain Boys, and I'll own—but they've got to knuckle soon, for Red Hazle can't now be more than a mile, or so, off, and then'— The Captain turned his head, and beheld in the speaker the traitor Remington, who had arrived unperceived, and now stood unblushingly, and with a malicious and exulting lear, looking him in the face. The double-faced villain, however, was met by the old veteran with such a withering look of scorn and contempt, as caused him to pause in his remarks, and soon to slink away behind the guards. Muttering a few deep and bitter curses upon the object of his aversion, on whom he looked as the despicable instrument of his present misfortunes, Captain Hendee again turned to watch the progress of the battle. `Keep your eyes on the field, girls,' said the old gentleman, after closely scanning the appearance of the belligerent forces a moment. `They are evidently on the eve of some important evolution. There! see there! there goes the fire of our whole line upon them in a single blaze! Ah! that fire must have told dreadfully on the enemy!' he continued, with an exulting air, while waiting for the dispersion of the smoke that, curling its wavy folds over the American lines, at this terrible volly, concealed for an instant both them and their foes completely from view. `Yes, dreadfully, as they acknowledge, by not returning the fire. There, you can just see their scarlet lines now,—and in confusion! staggering and recoiling in confusion, as I live! And by Jupiter! see! how like lightning the black masses of the continentals are throwing themselves into columns! They charge! they charge! Heavens! what a clash of encountering steel!—but no wavering in the charging columns yet. On they move! And by the Lord of Heavens! the Red-coats give way before them! They reel,—break, and run—yes, see! see! the poor beaten devils are fairly taking to their heels! ha! ha! Hurra for the Green Mountain Boys! ha! ha! ha! ha!' And the excited old veteran, breaking the restraint which his situation, as a closely guarded prisoner, had imposed, leaped up, and clapped his hands in gleeful exhultation. `Stop that d—n'd old fool's gab!' shouted the nettled and chafing Darrow, who, having taken a separate station in the bushes, some rods distant, stood deeply absorbed in the movements of the field, when the old gentleman's exclamations reached his ears: `stop his gab, I say! or spit him on your bayonet, and hurl him over the cliff. Hell! Here, let me come—I may as well have my revenge now as ever.' As with angry growls Darrow was hastening through the bushes to the spot, the nearest guard brought down his piece, and drew back for a thrust at the Captain with his bayonet; but in the act, he suddenly started, dropped his musket, gave a convulsive 17* screech, sallied back, and was on his way to the earth, when the sharp and stunning report of a dozen rifles, from the back of the hill, burst upon the ears of the startled captives, and their no less astonished captors, who, in their eagerness to see the action had neglected to keep watch against a surprise from pursuing enemies from the woods. `There! take that, damn you!' exclaimed Darrow, as more intent on accomplishing his meditated revenge than attempting a defence, he sprang forward, the instant he perceived himself attacked, within a rod of the captives, discharged his pistol at Captain Hendee, and, without waiting to see the effect of his shot, which his eager haste had luckily rendered a vain one, jumped off the cliff, and, venturously leaping from shelf to shelf down the precipice, disappeared in the direction of Sherwood's station at the foot of the hill. The surviving tories, for four of them had been stretched lifeless upon the earth by the shot of their assailants, discharged their guns at random towards the covert of their yet unseen foes, and fled along the cliff to the south, to gain the gorge where Sherwood and his party had descended. But they were a moment too late to effect their object. The movement having been perceived by Selden's party, for, as the reader has doubtless already anticipated, the assailants were no other, they suddenly closed up that end of their line, and cut off the retreat of the fugitives, who, quickly tacking about, commenced their flight back towards the captives, with the view of escaping along the ledge to the north of them. `Aha! ye scampering satans, you can't go that this time!' exclaimed the sharp and rattling voice of Pete Jones, who with a dozen sturdy fellows at his heels, at that instant burst through the bushes, and came down like a whirlwind, upon the baffled tories in time to prevent them from gaining the thicket in the rear of the captives,—`spread out there, boys, and be ready to give 'em the lead at the word,' continued the scout, motioning to his men, who promptly complying, cocked their rifles, and throwing themselves into a half circle, continued with hasty steps to advance upon the affrighted wretches, now standing huddled together on the brink of the precipice, and looking wildly around them for some chance to escape. `Now, ye painted divils,' resumed Jones, still drawing up with leveled rifle, `now you have got to jump, or take it.' `Misunderstanding the real intentions of the scout, which were to frighten, and then give quarters, and expecting to be shot down the next instant, the tories threw down their guns, and with one consent, plunged madly from the cliff! `Blood and Bayonets! who would have thought that?'—exclaimed the woodsman, in tones of mingled horror and surprise, as he stepped up and peered over the brink, from which, down a broken, but nearly perpendicular descent of over an hundred feet, this desperate leap had been taken. `Now I'll be blamed, if it don't make me feel ugly—only see 'em there!' he continued, gazing down upon the mangled wretches at the foot of the precipice, with an expression of the deepest commiseration, `only see! three or four lay there in a heap, panting and quivering at the last gasp! And there's the rest, just crawling off into the bushes like snakes with their backs broke! Howsomever,' he added, turning away with an effort to shake off the feeling, `we can't very well afford the poor devils a great deal of lament, for the same sarce would have been ours, if we'd fell into the hands of their sort of cattle, jest as sure as Tory is their name, and infarnal their nater.' In the meanwhile Selden, followed by the rest of his company, had reached the spot; and the former having flown to the side of his overjoyed Jessy and her friends, the now liberated captives, was exchanging those hasty and heartfelt greetings, which the circumstances were so well calculated to call forth, when a new and startling war-cry rose from the thicket below, where he had just learned from his rescued friends that Sherwood with the main part of his band was posted. `Do you hear that, my brave fellows?' exclaimed the young officer in a tone that rung through the forest, as he burst from the group of his embracing friends, and, with a look of kindling enthusiasm, leaped forward towards his men, `do you hear that rallying shout below? But let them come! The red-coats are flying in confusion before our friends in yonder field. Let their scurvy minions here in the bush be taught the same lesson. Every man to his post!' Responding with hearty and reiterated cheers to the words of their gallant leader, the men flew to their stations along the ridge to await the approach of their foes, who were now evidently rallying for a rescue. At this instant a shower of bullets struck the crags at the very feet of the captives. `Jones, your assistance!' shouted Selden, rushing back to the group who had thus narrowly escaped death, and pointing him to Alma, as he himself grasped his own affianced girl in his arms, and with rapid steps bore her back nestling and trembling on his bosom to a place of temporary safety over the screening ridge in the rear. Comprehending the other at a glance, the scout bounded forward to the side of Miss Hendee, at that instant engaged in trying to quiet the alarms of her less self-possessed domestic, when concluding to give the order of his superior its most liberal construction, he gave a swoop with his long arms, and gathering both mistress and maid in his grasp, and lifting them high from the ground, bore them, blushing through their alarms, at their novel situation aloft, over the hill, occasionally pausing in his monstrous strides over rock and log, to give a wink to Neshobee to follow his example with Zilpah, the only female now left on the spot of danger. `Guess you catch um first,' tartly observed the yellow maiden, eluding the hesitating grasp of her bashful gallant, and darting forward like an arrow towards her friends. `Where is my father?' enquired Alma with a look of concern, the instant she was released from the arms of the scout. `Your father, mum?' replied Jones, `O, didn't yer see him?—Why, that careless shot of the enemy there among you jest now seemed to raise the old Captain's dander right up, and seizing the gun of that dead tory, that my old Trusty here brought down in such good time for the old gentleman, I'll be blest if he didn't hobble off like the very mischief to help the boys man the cliff. And your tame red skin has concluded to do the same thing, I reckon, seeing as how he got the mitten,' added the scout, tipping a knowing and saucy wink to Zilpah. A general discharge of rifles and musketry by Selden's party along the top of the ridge to the south, here interrupted the conversation, announcing that the enemy had made their appearance on their way up the hill towards the accessible points in the ledge. `That must be a feint,' observed Captain Selden; `they cannot be serious in any attempt to mount the ridge in the very teeth of our death-dealing rifles, can they, Jones?' `No, Captain, that an't no part of their calkerlation, I'll swear to it. Neither need we have any fears of their flanking round the ledge to the north of us, as that might bring 'em between two fires, one from us, and another from the field. So, while a few of 'em are showing themselves, and firing jest enough to keep up the sham, the main part will push round at the other end of the ridge, about a half mile or so, to the south of us. And I should'nt be surprised if the lead was flying considerable thick along here in the matter of twenty minutes from now— what suppose you put the women a jogging, Captain; and let me be looking to the sarpents a little,' added the scout, glancing uneasily around him, and showing signs of impatience to be gone. `You are right, Jones,' promptly replied Selden, `and there is now but one course to be pursued. The ladies must pass down the hill, and, striking for the open field, endeavor to gain the rear of our army. I must attend them, leaving the command of the men with you to cover our retreat—can you do it?' `Why, I rather guess I mought; that is, if you will clear with the women—the sight of them kinder clogs a fellow, you know.' `Call in Captain Hendee, then. He is not nimble enough for a bush fight. Send us also Neshobee, and two of my men as an escort.' `Ay, ay, Captain,' cheerfully responded the scout, loping off at a rapid pace to his charge—`Ay, ay, we'll fix it about right, won't we, old Trusty? Trol, lol, lol, de larly.' Within five minutes from the disappearance of Jones, the family party were all collected, and in rapid motion down the hill. Nor was the expedition with which the movement was accomplished uncalled for by the event: For scarcely had they proceeded a furlong on their rout, before the cracking and irregular reports of rifles behind them announced an attack by the foe in a manner just predicted by the sagacious scout. Passing onward with all the speed they were capable of making, they paused not in their course till they reached the spot where they and their captors had halted in the morning. There, after taking charge of Captain Hendee's horse, which had been left tied to a tree, and ascertaining from the direction and distance of the firing at the scene they had just left, that Jones was at least maintaining his position on the hill, they turned short to the west, and made their way immediately to the opening, where the main action, as was evident from the heavy discharge of artillery that occasionally came pealing through the forest, was still kept up by the slowly retreating enemy. On arriving at the borders of the woods, our party entered the mouth of a ravine, which, while it protected them, by its screening banks, from the view of any spies whom Sherwood might have posted on the hill, luckily led up, and opened upon the plain, directly abreast of the position now occupied by Warrington's regiment of Green Mountain Boys. Passing hastily along, in Indian file, up this ravine till fairly beyond rifle-shot distance from the woods, and arriving by this time at an elevation, where, still unseen, they could easily obtain a glance over the scene of action, the company halted for the purpose of ascertaining, before proceeding any further, the exact position of the American forces, and the prospect of maintaining the temporary advantages which they had evidently already obtained over the boasted brigade of the gallant, but now mortified General Frazier. A misty veil of undissipated smoke still hung over the field of battle, and prevented Selden and Captain Hendee, who mounted the bank for the purpose, from ascertaining any thing more than the general position of the hostile armies. The Americans having pursued their routed enemies a short distance, had fallen back upon the ground occupied by them at the onset; while the British, having collected and rallied their broken and disordered forces, had made a sullen stand about half a mile distant. `Our troops have beaten the red-coats and driven them from the field of attack, it is evident;' observed Selden musingly, as he ran his eye anxiously over the field, `and yet, I fear, their temporary victory has been bought too dearly to permit them to avail themselves of the advantages they have obtained.' `I fear so too,' replied Captain Hendee, `nor do I exactly like the aspect and motions of the enemy yonder.—See! they are now deploying off towards the woods against our left wing. They are either preparing for a fresh onset in a new form, or opening for a reinforcement large enough to form a center; and I am apprehensive the latter, as, now I bethink me, I heard a treacherous scoundrel, who came near us a few moments before you arrived for our rescue, making the boast that a fresh body of Burgoyne's German hirelings were but a mile or two distant, and in full march for the field.' `God forbid!' exclaimed Selden, with a look of anxiety and alarm. `But this must instantly be seen to. Perhaps our officers are not aware of it. I must immediately forward to Warrington. Keep your position here, my friends, till I return, which shall be soon, better informed how to act, and with some plan for your disposal, or escape,' added the young officer, as leaping down into the valley, he seized the horse from the hands of Neshobee, mounted, and, waving a hasty adieu to the ladies, dashed forward at full speed over the plain to the American lines. Captain Hendee, still retaining his post of elevation, continued anxiously to watch those movements of the enemy which had raised his suspicions of an approaching reinforcement. Nor had many minutes elapsed before his worst apprehensions were confirmed by the appearance of Reidesel, who with flying colours and rattling drums, and all the pomp and pride of military array, came pouring the numerous troops of his well trained brigade across the field, and bearing down in solid columns directly upon the American centre, which stood calmly awaiting their approach; while at the same time, Frazier, with his whole force, a little in advance of the Germans, moved rapidly along under the woods to the South against the extreme left of the Americans, mostly composed of the doubtful regiment of Hale. A few moments of awful suspense followed; and again the flash of a thousand exploding muskets enveloped the encountering hosts in clouds of rolling 18 smoke, and shook the earth and heavens with the fearful concussion that followed. At that instant Selden, accompanied by a soldier with two horses, emerged from the smoke and came galloping to the spot. `Prepare for instant flight!' he exclaimed, hastily dismounting, and urging his horse down the bank towards the little grassy nook on which the females stood instinctively crowding together in mute consternation at the fearful noise and commotion of the plain above. `Ten minutes delay on this spot may again make you prisoners, and in the hands of a brutal and exasperated soldiery.' `There is no hope, then, that our troops can long withstand this fresh and formidable onset?' said Captain Hendee, coolly preparing to mount the horse allotted to carry him and his daughter, in the manner in vogue among the settlers of carrying their females behind them on horseback. `Scarcely longer perhaps than to allow us time to gain the forest,' replied Selden, placing Jessy on the crupper of his own horse, and springing himself into the saddle before her, while the little cavalcade, the two maids having been placed on the back of the third horse, began to move slowly down the rocky and frequently obstructed ravine. `I feared so,' said the former; `but where in the name of Heaven is St. Clair all this time, that he sends no reinforcement?' `Well may you ask that, Captain Hendee,' said Selden bitterly—`within hearing of our guns—with a full knowledge of our attack by a superior force, and with more than two thousand troops at disposal, all impatient to be with us, he allows not a man to come to our assistance. God forgive him! I can't.' `Nor I; but what of that dainty-fingered colonel, whom I noticed from the hill standing aloof and idle with his regiment at a distance on the left?' `Hale? Eternal infamy on his name! Having looked coldly on, and without lifting a finger in assistance through the whole of the first assault, he, on the approach of Frazier in this last onset, hoisted a white flag—even before it could be seen by the enemy, and disgracefully surrendered his regiment, with all the chance in the world to save it by retreat. And by this craven act he has thrown all that important part of the field into the possession of the British, who are already sweeping past us, and securing the roads to the south, leaving our brave friend Warrington with his regiment of heroes, (scores of whom are stretched bleeding, or lifeless on the field,) and the gallant Colonel Francis with his battalion of Massachusetts troops, to contend with a fresh force of more than double their numbers. But they must soon give way—not to retreat in a body, for every pass by which that could be effected is now closed against them,—much less to surrender themselves as prisoners, but to break, scatter and save themselves as they best can, to rally again in some appointed place round the standard of their lion-hearted leader.' `And which way do you and Warrington propose for our flight, after reaching the forest?' `An old by-road leading from the head of yonder pond directly across the country to Otter Creek, and there intersecting the Creek road to Pittsford and the older settlements. One of our guards, here must be despatched to call in Jones with a dozen trusty men to guard us on our way, while the rest of my company shall keep the accursed Sherwood and his gang, if possible, engaged, that he may have no way to discover the route we have taken till we are beyond the reach of his malice. But hark! 'tis a shout of triumph from, the British lines! Forward with all possible speed—for God's sake, forward to the woods!' Dashing onward at the word, the whole party in a moment more gained the confines of the forest, and quickly disappeared within its recesses, thus escaping the dangers of the field, where they had been nearly involved in the general melee of dispersing, pursued and pursuing combatants, that ensued at the close of that fierce and bloody conflict, but escaping only to encounter other perils, in their flight through the woods, of a still more fearful and dreaded character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “The hour of fate draws on.” The setting sun was throwing his parting beams of rich and mellow light, in a thousand variegated hues, over the intermingling foliage of the deciduous and perennial forest, that deeply clothed the mountain slopes to the eastward of the sluggish Otter. The hardy and heroic woman, whose lot had been cast in the wilderness on the banks of that stream, and whose curious abode we have described in a former chapter, still fearlessly retained her post, in spite of all the terrors and dangers of an invasion which had driven every settler, to the north and west of her, from his home, and laid open all that section of the Grants, to her very doors, to the unopposed ravages of British and savage foes. Her toils for the day being over, she was now sitting at the door of her rude cabin, enjoying, with an anxious and thoughtful brow, the grateful coolness of the evening air, while her hopeful brood of embryo foresters were lolling upon the grass, or gamboling in childish freaks around her. `O, mother! what was it that I seed over yonder, that twinkled kinder white in the bushes, just now?' exclaimed one of the younger boys, starting up with excited looks, and pointing to the opposite side of the creek at a spot some distance up the stream, where the clearing, extending to the water, afforded a fair view of the forest—lined banks of the western side of the river. The mother started, and threw a quick glance in the direction thus indicated, but perceiving nothing, she sank back into her seat, and observed, `I doubt whether you saw any thing, my son; but if you did, it was probably a flock of pigeons, or some other birds rising from the ground.' `No it want, mother,' replied the boy confidently, `it want birds! It was something coming proper fast along this way, by an open place in the trees, and looked jist like folks running with white clothes on.' Aroused by this last remark, as well by the eager and confident manner in which it was made, Mrs. Story hastily rose, advanced a few steps, and sent an anxious and scrutinizing look along the opposite bank in search of the object that had so excited the 18* boy's attention. That object was the next moment disclosed to her in the partial view she obtained of a small company of both sexes on horseback, urging forward their smoking and jaded steeds with all possible haste towards the landing on that side of the stream. She had been accidentally apprised that the Hendee family were on their way south the day previous, and having heard a distant, heavy firing, in the direction they had taken, the fore part of the present day, and coupling these circumstances with the hurrying and alarmed appearance of the approaching company, a painful apprehension now flitted across her mind; and, with an air of deep concern, she stepped inside the door, took down her rifle, and began to proceed, at a hurried pace, towards the creek. Some doubt, however, seeming to arrest her steps, she stopped short, and again gave eye and ear to objects before and around her. The report of several rifles, some hundred yards up the stream, followed by the distant shout of skirmishers, at that instant reached the spot, and at once resolved her doubts. Turning hastily to her children, now huddling with looks of alarm around her, and ordering them into the house, she flew down the path through the woods to her landing, drew out her canoe from its concealment, and springing in, pushed out boldly for the opposite shore, at which she arrived just as the fugitives, with soiled and torn garments, and way-worn and troubled looks, came hurrying up to the spot. `God bless you for for this timely promptitude, Mrs. Story,' exclaimed Selden, leaping from his horse, and assisting the females and the infirm and sadly jarred old veteran to dismount. `You are pursued?' eagerly asked the widow. `We are,' answered Selden, `and have been every step of the way from the red field of Hubbardton. We did not, however, intend to have brought peril to your house. But striking across the country to the creek, with the hope of escaping up the road to Pittsford, we discovered the road to be ambushed by a party of our outstripping foes, and, as our only hope of escape, turned down stream to find refuge at your abode. And even this we never should have reached alive, but for the protecting rifles of that noble fellow, Pete Jones, and his brave and trusty scouts, who are still keeping fourfold their numbers at bay till we can cross.' `Well, heaven be praised for your deliverance so far,' rejoined the widow, who still sat in her boat, heading it up against the bank for the others to enter, `but come, girls, jump in here—we will take you over first.' `Ay, ay,' said Selden, `there is not a moment to be lost. And here, Neshobee,' he continued, as the native, who had followed his friends on foot, now arrived, `throw down your rifle, dash in there, and swim across to bring back the boat, while I lead the horses into a thicket—perhaps they may be saved. At all events there is no chance to swim them over here.' `The canoe will not carry us all safely,' said Alma, in a quiet and sorrowful tone, as her companions, who had first entered, seated themselves in the boat. `O, no danger—not the least; step in,' said the widow encouragingly. `No, let me remain,' replied the former. `There will probably be no danger till the boat can return. But if there should be,' she added in the same plaintive and desponding accents, `if there should be, what matters it to me?' `Alma Hendee!' said the widow, looking up at the other with an air of mingled surprise and expostulation, `how is this?—where is your fortitude?' The grief-stricken maiden made a slight effort to speak, but the utterance died away on her quivering lip, and the bright tear drops stood in her eyes. `What has happened to her?' asked the woman, looking round on the company with an expression of wonder and concern. `Warrington has fallen in battle,' replied Selden, with an unsuccessful effort to speak without emotion. `Now, Heaven forbid!' exclaimed the widow, in accents which plainly told the shock which the sad announcement had imparted to her feelings. `Yes, the gallant fellow has left us,' resumed the other. `The melancholy tidings were received from a soldier, who joined us in our flight, and who said he saw him fall dead from his horse in the last moments of the battle. But do not allow yourself to despond, my dear Miss Hendee. You had better go over now,' he added, soothingly, as he approached, and gently urged the mutely sorrowful, but now passive girl into the boat, which was instantly headed round, and, under the strokes of the strong armed widow, sent surging towards the other shore. Stopping no longer than to see the females under weigh, Selden sprang up the bank, seized the horses by their bridles, and whipping them into a lively trot, led them into a neighboring thicket, tied them to saplings, and flew back to the shore. The active young Indian, who had readily undertaken to swim the stream, had already returned with the canoe, taken in Captain Hendee, and sat impatiently waiting, with uplifted oar, to push again from the shore. `There! now lay too with a will, my lad,' cried Selden, leaping into the boat just as the scattering fire of several rifles, quickly returned by that of a much larger number, a short distance beyond, burst from the bushes at a point now not more than a quarter of a mile up the stream, apprising them that the enemy were rapidly driving in Jones and his party, who, as previously concerted, were retiring before their pursuers in three divisions, each in turn coming in front, discharging their pieces from their coverts, and scudding on to the rear of the others to reload and await the approach of their foes. `If we can get one boat-load of men safely over,' resumed Selden, `we shall be able, I trust, to protect the rest in crossing; and when all are over, I hope to keep the rascals on their own side of the river.' `That may be done till dark, perhaps,' observed Captain Hendee, `but with our small force, not after, I think. No, Captain Selden, unless the disposition of these tories is less devilish than I rate it, and the nature of their Indian allies has changed since I used to deal with the hell-hounds, we may as well prepare for a siege.' `Let it come, then,' replied the other determinedly —`with the widow's “Tother world” for a concealment and strong hold for the women and children, and those impervious logs of her cabin to protect us while we fight, many a tory and red-skin must take a leaden supper before they capture us. But here we are, safe ashore. Neshobee, will you take back the boat, or shall I?' `Me go,—no fraid,' answered the native, again pushing out into the stream. `Very well,—I will remain to superintend the transportation of the men. And you, Captain Hendee, had better proceed immediately to the house, and, if you will, be looking a little to the means of defending it. An old soldier like yourself will need no instructions in that duty. Hold out bright hopes to the ladies, but see that they retire from the upper world in season, and while they may, undiscovered, if their passage to the lower, with which I am unacquainted, is likely to expose them to the sight of the enemy.' `Ay, ay, I will see to it,' replied the other, hurrying off with unwonted activity to the cabin, where he was met at the door by the widow. `What is the prospect, Captain?' she asked in a low, eager tone. `The men will get over, I think, with few or no losses, but'— `But what?' `Those untiring fiends are after blood! Our men have already to day made a heavy inroad on their numbers, and they are determined on revenge. I have no hope but that they will find means to cross the creek and besiege us, as soon as it is dark.' `Nor have I the least, since Alma has told me the particulars of your disasters, and the conduct of that wretch who has caused them. Hendee, I have long known that Jake Sherwood, and have wondered at your course.' `I was duped—deceived, Ann Story, but I have been an egregious old fool even at that, I will own, —besides treating my own flesh and blood like a tyrant and a brute. Furies! I could beat my own brains out! If you were a man, and connected with me as you are, you ought to curse me to my face. A good round damming from a friendly source would seem to relieve my feelings. But where are the girls?' `All within here. They have taken a litttle refreshment, and seem getting up their spirits a little.' `Well, we will not dampen their feelings at present; but they, and you with your children, had better be on the move to your underground refuge.' `That is easily gained now.' `Why, you enter the creek, as formerly, don't you?' `No, I have made a fine improvement this summer. Come, attend me, and you shall see.' `I will, but must first glance at the means we shall have of defending the house, which we must make our fortress, for beating off or weakening the enemy. Your place of concealment below must be the last resort of the men, if they enter it at all.' They now entered the house and were met by the anxious and enquiring looks of the girls, who sat silently waiting to hear the news which the Captain might have brought from the scene of action. `Has he'—at length commenced Miss Reed, unable longer to repress her anxiety, but stopping short and blushing at the exclusiveness of the enquiry she was about to make, `has—that is, is the danger over?' `We hope so,' replied the Captain, `at least there can be but little danger for you females. Captain Selden trusts to prevent the enemy from crossing. He commands without, and I, for the present, within; and I hope to find in you a brave garrison.' `Jessy, at least, will prove no coward for herself, I suspect,' remarked the widow a little archly. `Well, both she and Alma are soldiers' daughters,' resumed the Captain, `and should danger beset us to-night, I trust they will bear themselves as they have already done for the last twenty-four hours, with firmness and fortitude. But now for the business on hand,' he added, turning to the hostess, and glancing round the walls of the house. `Very well, sir, and to begin, here is my double plank door—bullet-proof, I think, and the fastenings abundantly secure.' `Yes, I have noticed, but what loop holes shall we have to fire from, besides that window?' `Here,' answered the widow, stepping up to one of the walls, and pulling out a nicely fitting block from a cone shaped embrasure cut through one of the logs. `There are two of these on each side and end of the house, and as many more just below the eves in the chamber loft above.' `Just the things for us—and now if we had but a long square block to fill that window'— `You have it at hand, with a loop like the rest, in that block on which the children are sitting there.' `Admirable! a regular fort, by George! Ann Story, you ought to be the wife of a general. Let us now proceed to your unfindable fastness below.' `In an instant,' said the widow, going to the fire and blowing up a torch. `Boys lift that door,' she added, pointing to a trap door in the corner of the room that opened into the cellar. Followed by the Captain, the widow now descended through the trap in the floor on a short ladder into the cellar, and going to the western side, and removing a bundle of straw standing against the wall, disclosed the entrance of a narrow, upright passage, leading off into the earth, in the direction of the river. `Come on!' said the prompt and energetic woman, plunging directly into the dark vaulted way before her, as she held the torch partly before her guest. After proceeding several rods through this straight and narrow passage, all smoothly cut through the solid earth some distance below the surface, they came to a lateral excavation, forming an arched room about a dozen feet square. `This is my half-way house—my innermost recess,' said the widow, stepping into the center of the room and holding up the light that the other might see to examine. `This is a much stronger place than the outer, or western room, which you have been into before, I believe, as the earth is here much thicker above us, owing to a swell in the surface, over which, to make it still more difficult to dig through, spread the widely branching roots of several large maples.' `True,' replied the Captain, `and one man at each entrance might defend the place against hundreds. Ah! I plainly see that we old soldiers have got to yield the palm to you, Ann: In all my experience of twenty years among these northern forests in fighting and dodging the enemy, and planning, building, or seeking out places for forts, defences and refuges, I never saw or thought of any thing like this establishment of yours.' `I can think of no way by which our foes can rout us from this,' rejoined the widow, `unless they storm us, or smoke us out. I believe I shall curtain off this room with blankets for the children and girls to night, while we give up the other room, if needed, to our defenders. But you have seen enough of this, let us pass on.' They now entered the remaining part of the passage, 19 which, after running a few rods in a direct line, and then winding round to the left, brought them into the large partitioned room we have formerly described. `This you have seen before,' said the widow, pausing as they entered the room, `and there is nothing new to show you here, except my stores; those barrels,' she continued, pointing to two casks standing just within the entrance of the smaller room, `contain provisions, which, on the rumor of the approaching invasion, I employed my neighbor just before he left us, to purchase for me at Crown Point.' `Well, it is not impossible that we shall need them,' remarked the Captain thoughtfully. `Famine often follows closely in the footseps of war,' resumed the other; `so I thought I would supply myself in season. Nor do provisions constitute the whole of my supplies; for it occurring to me at the same time that something like the present emergency might happen, I made another purchase, which may be still more important to us.' `What may that be?' asked the other. `Stand back to the mouth of the entrance, take, and hold up this torch, and I will show you,' answered the woman, proceeding to the opposite side of the room, taking down a broad piece of bark, which had been snugly fitted into the mouth of a little, low chamber, or recess, excavated in the earthy wall, and disclosing to view the ends of some half dozen strongly bound casks, to which she now directed his attention with her finger. `What have you there, Ann, so mysteriously hid up,' said the old gentleman with a look of mingled curiosity and surprise. `Gun powder, with an abundance of loud behind there to serve.' `Indeed! but not all your own, surely?' `No;—only one is mine—the rest belong to the settlers, who live north of this, and who, expecting that a stand would have been made against the enemy in this vicinity, had, it seems, amply provided themselves for the crisis. But finding that resistance would be useless, they concluded to flee; when, getting wind of my strong hold, they brought their munitions, which they were unable to carry with them, to this place for safe keeping till they should return or send for them.' `Faith! that's lucky,' exclaimed the Captain. `It may be wanted to supply the powder horns of the men, and—and'—he continued partly to himself, as he glanced about the room, with a look of wild and exulting joy at the thought which seemed to strike his mind, `and with the chance which these underground rooms and passages afford, as a last resort, of blowing that infernal gang nearer heaven than they will otherwise ever get—but time enough to think of that when other measures fail.' `What measures?' asked the widow, who, having been busy in replacing the door of her magazine, had not heeded the remarks of the other, except two or three words at the close. `O, nothing of any present moment,' answered Captain Hendee, with the air of one willing to let the words pass without being understood; `but let us now see how you have fixed the outer entrance.' Resuming her torch, the widow immediately led the way through the passage to the entrance at the bank of the Creek. `There! having no further use for this entrance, I have fastened it up,' said she, pausing as she approached the end of the avenue, which was blocked up by a single layer of square short timbers, placed horizontally across the passage and let into the earth at the ends. `It can only be opened on the inside, as you perceive, or at least, not easily; and I have considered it a safe barrier, though, to be sure, by considerable digging on the out side—but hush!—hark! Do you hear that shouting out upon the creek, or on its banks?' `Ay; and it sounds as if there's trouble afoot too. Cannot this top timber be removed without danger of exposing the entrance to the discovery of the enemy from the opposite bank?' `I should think so, as the mouth is pretty thickly overhung with bushes.' `Let us lift it out then, that we may see, or at least hear, what is going on.' The timber was accordingly carefully removed; when through the crevice thus formed, a tolerable distinct view was obtained of a long reach of the creek above, and a short one below. The last boat load of Selden's men had gained the middle of the stream, and were pulling with all possible speed for the hither shore, on which all those who had crossed were posted behind their coverts, keenly watching, with cocked and leveled pieces, for the first head that should be raised on the opposite bank to fire upon the boat. The boat's crew, as they had been ordered, were all seated, save one man, who had inadvertently risen on his feet to point out to his commander on shore the object which had caused the noise and stir that had reached the ears of the widow and her friend. The man's arm was still extended up the river with the motions of one trying to count a series of some moving objects. The widow, having the most favorable position for the purpose, instantly turned her eyes in the direction thus indicated. What can you see as the cause of the commotion?' asked the Captain, after the other had gazed an instant in silence. `Well, I confess, I don't know exactly what to make of them,' replied the woman, as with a puzzled expression she still kept her eyes riveted on the spot:—`something is evidently crossing the creek, nearly as far as I can see up the stream. At any other time, I should think it must be a flock of cranes with their long necks only above water.' `It is the Indians!' exclaimed the Captain, in low startling accents—`it is the Indians, swimming the Creek on their backs, and holding their guns upright on their breasts. I have seen their tricks before to day.' At that instant a stream of smoke, accompanied by the sharp crack of a rifle, shot out fiercely from an old tree top on the opposite bank, while, at the same time, the man standing in the boat fell over backwards into the water, and sunk, to rise no more, beneath its bubbling surface. An exclamation of horror rose to the lips of the Captain and the widow; but before it could be uttered, and while the echoes of the last shot were yet ringing among the neighboring hills, the stunning report of another rifle, bursting from the bank directly over their heads, and followed by a hollow groan, and a floundering fall in the bushes on the other side, told that the death of the victim was avenged. `There! Jim Townley,' exclaimed the well known voice of Pete Jones, on the bank above, “`Old Trusty” has done the business for your murderer, I 19* guess; though if he hadn't tore his coat so as to make a white spot in his back, as he was slinking away, I never could have got an aim worth firing for. Well,' he continued, soliloquizing, as he appeared to be reloading his piece, `that is the way with the best of us. Jim was a fellow of first rate grit, and I'd rather gin any thing but old Trusty—yes, and that too,—than to have him gone so. But if spirits can hear and see things, as some think, it will be a grand comfort to one of Jim's spunk and pride, on his way along up, to know that the bloody rascal didn't live to brag on't.' The survivors of the boat's crew, now reaching the landing, sprang upon the bank, and took their stations among their comrades along the shore, to watch any further appearance of their foes. But none daring to show themselves after the lesson just received, a silence of some minutes now prevailed. The calm was not destined, however, to last long. Another cry of alarm was soon raised by one of the men, eagerly calling on the rest to look down the stream. `O, the divils! the divils!' cried the shrill voice of Jones, `they have stole our horses, and are swimming them across down there, with two of the lubbers on the back of every horse. By Judas! what a chance to plug them, if I was only forty rods nearer! Say, Captain Selden, what if I take two or three men, and scud down that way a little?' `No, Jones,' replied Selden, `our force is too small to scatter. The Indians in a few moments more will be upon us from above; besides, we have not a man to lose in open fight. Let every one, therefore,' he continued, raising his voice to a tone of command, `retire from the bank, and, keeping a tree in his range, repair directly to the house. Then let them come with a welcome.' `Well, the hour of trial is at hand,' observed the widow with a sort of desperate calmness, `and may God be merciful unto us. Assist me, Captain Hendee, to replace this timber; and then I must instantly back to bring down my children and the girls. The men will reach the house by the time we can get there ourselves. There! that will do—all safe, I think. Now follow me as fast as your crazy old limbs will let you—come on—faster—faster—come on! come on!' And with the old veteran, taxing his powers of speed to the utmost to keep up the fearless woman, though anxious mother, with her torch streaming behind her, rather flew than walked, till she had gained the cellar, and sprang up the ladder leading up into the room, where she had left the objects of her solicitude. `Here!' she exclaimed, raising her head through the trap, and glancing round the room where the females, ignorant of what had taken place without, were unconcernedly sitting with the children, hanging about their chairs, `here, to the cellar, every chick and child of you, to the cellar! And you, girls, must follow, without a moment's delay,' she added, seizing the little urchins by the waist, and lifting them one by one in rapid succession down the pass-way, as, alarmed by the startling tones of their mother's voice, they ran huddling to the entrance. `Is there any immediate danger?' asked Alma, calmly, though with an expression of some surprise, at the rapid and agitated manner of the widow. `Not for us, if we are out of the way; but the tories are crossing below, and the Indians, on this side above, are, by this time, perhaps, within gunshot of us, in the skirts of yonder woods.' `And Selden and his men?'—eagerly said Jessy. `Will be here in a moment to make this room their fortress, for their own and our protection. And a shower of balls, through that open door and window, will probably salute them as they enter. `True, true,' observed Captain Hendee, who having crowded by the widow on the ladder, and gained the floor, now stepped to the door, hastily shut it, and proceeded to bring the block for closing up the window, `true, this danger to the girls and children did not occur to me, as it seems it did to you, by your leading my rheumatic legs such a deuced race through the passage from the creek. Yes, girls, down with you all, and on to the middle room, and have no fears but that we will defend you.' `But you, father?' said Alma, looking back as she was descending, with an expression of solicitude, `you are surely not to remain?—youare too are too old—infirm'— `I am young again, girl. The thought of our treatment, and the fate which our foes evidently design for us still, make me a soldier again—go down, my daughter, and may God be with you, and strike for us all,' said the old veteran, letting down the trap upon the last of the retiring party. Scarcely had the mingled voices of the women and children died away, as they retreated along the passage to their refuge under the earth, before Selden and his men came scattering along into the house, fortunately not, however, with the danger which the widow had anticipated. As soon as the whole company, now numbering but twelve, including Captain Hendee and Neshobee, had gained the room, they immediately proceeded to barricade the door, and put every thing in the best possible condition for a defence. While they were thus busily engaged, unmindful of the severe fatigues of the day, in the excitement created by the alarming prospects of the night, which was now about to set in, the trap door was pushed up, and the provident widow re-appeared, ascending the ladder with a large loaf of bread and a haunch of dried vension under one arm, and a pail of water, in which floated the accustomed gourd shell, slung on the other. With many a blessing on the widow's head, and many an oath to defend her and hers to the death, the famished and wearied soldiers eagerly fell upon the grateful repast, after which they repaired with renewed spirits to the several stations allotted them above and below along the walls. `I wish the rascals would make themselves manifest, if they are around us, as I suspect,' observed Selden, after the company had stood some time at their respective loop holes, silently awaiting the appearance of the enemy. `That they will be cunning enough not to do till the approach of darkness,' replied Captain Hendee. `Then you will hear from them, I'll warrant you. And as they can have but small hope of perforating these logs with their bullets, they will probably attempt to beat down the door, or burn the house over our heads.' `They will find the latter a difficult job, I imagine,' responded Selden. `These bare logs, after the heavy rain of last night, and that, too, at the distance which we can manage to keep the knaves, cannot offer much inducement for an attempt to ignite them with lighted arrows.' `True,' replied the other, `but you forget the roof —these bark coverings are rather combustible.' `No, I thought of that,' rejoined Selden, `and was about to remark, that if they fired the roof we must tear it off.' `That can be done, perhaps,' replied the former. `At all events, it will be time enough to think of it when they arrive for the attack; for I doubt whether there is now one of them within a quarter of a mile of us.' `Now, I've a notion there is,' said Pete Jones, who, in the mean while, had been keenly watching every appearance within the scope of his vision, `and I shouldn't be much surprised if some of those stumps and log-heaps over in the widow's grass yonder, if they could talk, would be willing to swear to it.' `Have you actually seen any of them, Jones?' asked Selden. `Why,' answered the scout, with his peculiar comic twist of features, `I have actually seen a sign or two, that I have never known fail, except in the dryest of times. And with your leave, Captain Selden, I have thoughts of an experiment, by way of putting the question at rest, and doing something more, perhaps, into the bargain.' `Well—very well'—said Selden, pausing for the other to explain the nature of his proposal. `Here is at it, then,' said the scout, choosing to answer, by actions rather than words, the enquiry which the manner of his superior implied, while he proceeded to strip off his coat, button it up, and, with the brush of an old broom that stood in a corner, distend the body, running the short handle into one arm to keep the artificial limb thus made in a horizontal position. `What are you a going to do with your scarecrow, now?' asked Selden, who, with the rest of the company stood looking on, anxious to learn the character of the proposed stratagem. `I'll show you in a minute,' replied Pete, now getting the poker and suspending his contrivance upon one end of it. `There, Captain Hendee, I want you should take charge of this concern—you'll know how to manage it,—while the rest of us, who have keener sight for aim in the dusk, will attend to our rifles. But mind ye, I have first got to deliver a little bit of an oration for the benefit of the gentlemen outside, if so be that they're within ear-shot, as I surmise.' The scout, then, after pulling out one end of the block in the window a short space, that his voice might the better be heard by those whom it was intended to reach, commenced and carried on by himself a sort of ventriloquial dialogue, purporting that a discovery had suddenly been made, that they were out of bullets, and were wishing to obtain a bar of lead that had been left standing outside under the window, while the question seemed to be, who should expose himself by reaching out his hand to get it; but one at length appearing to be found hardy enough to undertake the task, the speaker suddenly dropped the discourse and turned to the company present. `There, boys, have your muzzles to your loops, and your eyes on the lookout for game,' he said in a low eager tone. `And you, Captain Hendee, be ready to pass the figure up to the window, which I am about to lay open, and which all, as they value the union of body and soul, must keep out of the range of. Don't fire till I give the word. All ready? well, here goes then,' he added, swinging out the block and stepping quickly to his loop-hole. Captain Hendee now proceeded immediately to execute the part he had been requested to perform. And while the company were waiting with breathless interest the result, he moved along the effigy towards the window, so as to show only one arm and a portion of the bust to those who might be watching without, skilfully imparting to the figure the cautious and hesitating motions of a living actor, who might be supposed to be conscious of the hazard incurred, though determined to approach. Scarcely had the protruding arm entered the narrow opening, bringing one side of the body in fair view to the supposed lurking enemy without, when a bright flash suddenly gleamed through the window, and, with the almost simultaneous report of a dozen guns, bursting from the surrounding coverts, a shower of bullets passed through the effigy, and buried themselves in the logs of the opposite wall. There was again a momentary silence, when, with the lifting smoke along the line from which the fire proceeded, several dark forms became visible, peering out from their respective coverts, and quivering and dodging about in the dissipating vapor. Then came the sharp word of command from the watchful scout. `Fire!' Eight well aimed rifles from the loops along the walls above and below, instantly spoke in response; and the mingled screech of a half dozen voices, followed by a yell of rage and disappointment from the whole band of the beseigers, plainly told the result of the stratagem. `Now, by Hokey! if I don't keep this coat to brag on—six bullet-holes right through the body and the owner still alive and kicking!' exclaimed the scout, picking up the riddled garment and feeling out the bullet holes with his fingers, as the loud shout of exultation and defiance, which burst from the little band on the occasion, died away in the surrounding forest. For nearly an hour, the besieged, who had closed up their window and resumed their respective posts, now strained both car and eye in vain, to catch some sight or sound indicating the presence of the foe around them. But fully aware of the desperate and wily character of those with whom they had to deal, they determined to suffer none of their vigilance to relax. And but a short time elapsed before they made a discovery which taught them the wisdom of the resolution:—As all stood watching at their posts in silence, a low, short exclamation from the young Indian, testified that something suspicious had at length attracted his attention. `What now, Neshobee?' softly asked Selden, stepping noiselessly towards the native, who was lying on the floor in one corner, listening through a crevice which he had found between the lower logs. `Me no see nothing, but hark um scratch um buttons—guess um lift something,' was the somewhat hesitating reply. `I'll grant you the best “harkum,” as you call it, boy,' said Pete Jones, who stood near, and, on the exclamation of the Indian, had renewedly taxed his vision to discover the cause; `but as to eye-shot, you have got to knuckle to me, for I can see them; 20 and they are at some bobbery, too—though what in the name of reason it can be,' he continued, pausing and hesitating as he turned his head one way and then another, to obtain a more distinct view; `what it can be, I am dubious whether the divil himself can tell,—unless he contrived it for 'em. They are moving down the path this way—I believe—yes, and in pairs, too, like new married geese. What?—no —yes, they have got something upon their shoulders—I should think it was one of the corpses we made for 'em, which they were carrying to be buried, only it is as long as a sea-sarpent.' `Aha! I understand it,' cried the young leader, `it is some long timber which they intend to use as a battering-ram to beat in our door. And thank Heaven for the timely discovery, but for which, ten to one, we had been lost,—and even as it is there is danger enough. Stand to your guns, boys,' he continued, in a low thrilling tone, though sufficiently raised to reach every man within, `if we can but drop two or three of the foremost, the whole, probably will be carried down by the weight of the timber—cock your guns—keep a steady eye on the advancing column, and be ready for the word.' Slowly, and with noiseless tread, did the performers of this new mode of attack approach along the path, staggering under the weight of the long heavy pole, or rather the trunk of a closely trimmed tree, which they bore on their shoulders, till within three or four rods of the house; when squaring round, and pointing the but end of their formidable implement directly at the door, they began to bear it forward with mighty force towards the object of its aim, which the next instant must have given way before the tremendous impetus which it was gathering for the blow. At that critical juncture Selden gave the signal to his impatient men, and every gun that could be brought to bear was discharged upon the assailants. A cry of agony rose from the spot, followed with a shout of “hold on! for God's sake hold on!” Then was heard the sounds of floundering footsteps, and in another breath the whole came thundering to the ground. Once more the house rung with the triumphant shouts of the Green Mountain Boys, and all again was silent. Another long respite was allowed our little band, and during the hour succeeding the last onset, nothing could be seen or heard to betray the presence of the enemy any where in the vicinity of the spot. They had evidently retired to some distance to hold a consultation, and arrange some new method of attack. At length, however, the occasional cracking of a dry stick, as it broke apparently under cautiously moving feet in the field and woods around, apprised the intently listening band within, that the twice baffled foe were again stealthily drawing up to the spot, still bent on renewing, in some shape or other, the assault. After appearing to approach to their line of coverts, reaching within five or six rods of the house, a dead silence of many minutes ensued, leaving the besieged still wholly ignorant of the form, in which the threatened attack was to be made, and even, at length, in some doubt whether it was to be made at all. All at once a tremendous outcry broke though the surrounding gloom, and the thrilling yells of the savages, mingled with the hoarser shouts of the tories, resounded in one unceasing din through the forest. Startled, but not dismayed by this sudden outbreak, the Green Mountain Boys instantly cocked their pieces, and stood straining their vision to catch a glimpse of the foe. But they watched in vain. No living object was to be seen, though the noise, which seemed not to be the regular war-cry sometimes raised on the eve of an onset, but a promiscuous clamour, was continued without the least intermission. And together with the war-whoop and shout, the rattling of guns and ramrods, the crashing of dry brush, the beating of clubs against trees, the mimic hooting of owls, the howling and bellowing of wild beasts, with all imaginable noises, seemed to unite to swell the strange uproar. `Well, now, if I an't beat,' exclaimed Pete Jones, as usual the first with his comments on the occasion. `I wonder if the foolish satans expect to throw down our walls of hard maple logs, and well locked together at the ends to boot, by racket and roaring, as the Jewish militia did those of old Jericho, that I've read of in the scripter? I rather guess they will find it a hard go, unless they blow them down with horns of powder, as I've sometimes kinder reckoned must be the meaning of the good book, in that business I've just spoke of, seeing as how it was jest as easy for God to make 'em gun-powder to do it with, as 'twas manna to eat.' `I think it must be a feint,' replied Selden, `to cover some design of a more dangerous character than mere noise. An attack of some kind is doubtless in preparation for us; but in what manner, or place, the storm is to burst, I am wholly at loss to conjecture. Keep a keen eye abroad, boys. And you, Neshobee, go immediately down through the passage to the western entrance, where you heard Captain Hendee say he would repair, when he left us a short time ago. Tell him to keep a strict guard in that quarter, and if beset, send instantly for a reinforcement. And now, my brave lads,' he continued, turning to his men, `a crisis may be at hand, which will require your coolness and—but stay—what means this? Do my eyes deceive me, or is it growing lighter in the room?' `It is—it certainly is!' responded several. `The moon—the rising moon!' suggested others. `You needn't go to blaming the moon for this,' cooly observed Jones, `for, according to my reckoning, it wont be up this two hours.' `True,' said the leader; though evidently reflected light, it is not from the moon. See! see! how rapidly it increases!' he continued, as a sort of flickering suffusion of light, weak and scarcely perceptible at first, but growing stronger and more distinguishable every second, as if reflected from a steadily kindling flame in some unseen point in the heavens, now began dimly to light up the grounds around the house, and even render objects in the room visible. `This light was never made by the enemy to enable us to shoot them. There is mischief afoot somewhere. Let every man, then, stand to his post, and let every eye be strained to discover the cause.' At that instant the appalling cry of “fire! the roof is on fire!” resounded through the loft above, revealing at once to the startled inmates below the character of the expected danger, and the meaning of the mysterious uproar, which had, it was now evident, enabled the enemy to approach the house, mount it at the corners, set fire in different places to the roof with their ready prepared combustibles, and descend and escape unheard and undetected. `Cut the fastenings of the outside binders of the roof, and stave off every bark of the covering that 20* the fire has reached,' shouted the excited leader to the men above. `It will expose us to certain death from the shot of the enemy, to make an opening while we remain here,' was the reply. `Rip up the floor between us, then,' promptly said Selden, `to give us a chance to do it from below here—off with the fastenings! up with the floor! Hand us down two or three of those longest plank for our purpose, and descend yourselves to our assistance. Lively my men! As you value our salvation, be lively!' In prompt obedience to the command, the men tore up the loose boards composing the floor, and, after passing down to their comrades below such as might be needed, hastily threw the rest together at the ends of the loft, leaving all the inside of the roof open to the lower floor; when swinging themselves down by the bare beams, they joined in the operations already then in rapid progress upon the frail covering above. The long boards having been reared up endwise, and each one placed in the hands of two strong men, were now thrust forcibly against the roof at the different points where the fires were supposed to be burning on the outside; and several breaches were made, all expecting, that by the removal of a few of the barks the flames might be extinguished. But appearances soon taught them, that their hopes of thus conquering the element were wholly delusive. The light above, instead of dying away—as portions of the burning roof were removed, continued rapidly to increase. Small tongues of the lambent flames began to show themselves through the lateral crevices in the covering in numerous places, quivering, and leaping from point to point along the inner surface, while a general crackling above plainly told them that the fire had already spread nearly or quite over the whole of the outside of the roof. Perceiving that nothing short of unroofing the whole building would stop the progress of the flames, they now proceeded with renewed vigor in their operations. Piece after piece of the broad barks were beat off, and hurled blazing to the ground. And the work was continued with unabated energy till the last vestige of the burning material had been removed, and nothing but the naked rafters intervened between the lower floor, on which all our little band were now assembled, and the starry heavens above them. `There, thank Heaven, we are freed from that danger at last!' exclaimed Selden, in tones of gratulation, as he threw down the implement with which he had been assisting his men in their labors. `That's right enough,' observed the scout, whose attention for some moments seemed to have been arrested by some appearance he noticed through a loop hole. `All that is right enough mayhap; but while we are putting up thanks for deliverance from one danger, I am a little suspicious whether or no we had'nt better join to 'em a small bit of a prayer to be delivered from a worse one that we've got to see to soon, I've a notion—jest look here, Captain.' Selden turned to the spot occupied by the speaker, who stood silently and successively pointing to the different loop holes along the walls, and the words of the latter were explained. Flames, raising from the ground on the outside, began to be visible, and their flickering points were already darting up in fitful leaps athwart several of the apertures, announcing to the dismayed inmates, that a fire was in rapid progress on the outer walls of the house from combustibles, which had been piled up against them, doubtless, at the time of firing the roof, and which had been kindled by fire placed there by the enemy, or by burning fragments of bark falling down from above. All saw at a glance that it was utterly impossible to arrest, by any means now left them, the spreading conflagration, and that consequently the house must soon be relinquished to the devouring element. And but a few more moments had elapsed before they were warned, by the spouts of crackling flames now beginning to shoot up above the tops of the roofless walls, and by the sensibly increasing heat in the room, to prepare for their retreat to their last refuge in the subterraneous abode of their provident hostess. At that instant, the voice of Sherwood, the leader of their foes, was heard above the roaring of the flames, loudly calling on the besieged to yield themselves as prisoners, and come forth, lest they should perish in the fire. `Is there a possibility of getting a glimpse of that demon through the loops? asked Selden, in a tone of concentrated bitterness. `If there is, let a rifle bullet take back his answer.' In pursuance of the suggestion of their leader, the men made an attempt to get a sight of their foes, who, now sensible of their advantage, were heard shouting within a few rods of the house. But it was useless; for the walls, by this time, were so completely enveloped in fire and smoke as wholly to intercept the view of every object without. `Let us beat a retreat, then, for the widow's strong hold below,' resumed Selden; `but let us pause a moment to send a glance over yonder treetops, lest they contain eyes which will discover, in our movement, what I trust those exulting fiends do not, and will not suspect,—that this is not our last, nor best resource for baffling their hellish purposes. The last speaker had scarcely ceased, before Jones, who seemed to have anticipated the object of his superior, raised his rifle to his shoulder, preparatory to an aim, while his eye continued intently fixed on the body of a large hemlock standing eight or ten rods from the house. `What now, Jones?' said the former, who noticed the sudden movement of the scout. `Hold easy!' replied the other, `there's something that acts mightily like a red-skin going up the back side of that tree yonder. But he's so pesky delicate about showing any thing better than toes and fingers—stay—stay'—he continued, in a low gleeful chuckle, `there's a large limb just above him, which, if he's fool enough to try to pass it, must throw his body out of the track so far that— and, by Jethro! he is a going to try it. Now hold still as thunder, all, and I'll be the chap to speak to the red divil.' Every eye now glanced anxiously from the long and steadily poised tube of the scout to the tree in question, and a moment of breathless silence succeeded; when the sharp report of the piece rung through the forest, and the dull, heavy jar upon the earth, that instantly followed, told that another foeman was added to the long list of victims who had fallen beneath the murderous bullets of the unerring old Trusty. `Down! down with you all, before the smoke of the piece rises,' exclaimed Selden, as he now, after hurrying his men through the trap into the cellar, hastily descended himself and let the door down after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “The waves a moment backward bent— The hills that shake, although unrent, As if an earthquake pass'd— The thousand shapeless things all driven In cloud and flame athwart the heaven, By that tremendous blast.” Leaving the burning building to its fate, Selden and his men immediately entered the dark avenue below; when, after blocking up the mouth as well as they could, with earth and stones taken from the cellar wall, to keep out the smoke, as well as to secure it against the discovery and entrance of the enemy, should they break into the house before the progress of the flames in the interior should prevent them, they proceeded directly to the middle excavation. Here they they met their hostess walking with restless steps and anxious looks to and fro before the curtained apartment containing her family. `Well, Mrs. Story,' said Selden, as he approached at the head of his followers, `I regret to inform you that your house is irrecoverably on fire. We have done our best to avert the catastrophe, but have wholly failed, and even have been driven to retreat to your refuge for our own safety.' `I know it,' replied the widow, `I have been up to the mouth of the passage to listen every five minutes, and know all that has happened. But let the house go—all—every thing, and I am content if my treasures here,' she continued, with a slight tremour of voice as she pointed towards the curtained recess, `if my treasures here can but be spared me. The little fellows, thank Heaven, are now all a sleep, and know nothing of the dangers that hang over them. And God grant that they remain so till the hatchets of the hell-hounds now yelling above us shall,—if it is so ordered of Heaven,—shall be buried in their'—here choking with emotion at the horrid thought which her imagination began to suggest, she stopped short and was for a moment silent. `Captain Selden,' she at length resumed, `were my own personal safety alone concerned, I think I could follow you to the cannon's mouth without flinching. But when I find the lives of my children at stake, the mother instantly prevails within me, and I become, in spite of all I can do, a poor trembling coward. But enough of this—have you any reason to suspect the enemy are aware of our place of refuge?' `None whatever; and even at the worst, we think you have but little to fear. But where are the girls?' `Alma and Jessy are in yonder room guarding the hollow stub through which the smoke of our fire place escapes, lest some of the enemy should discover that avenue to the room, and attempt to descend.' `Nobly employed! But the duty shall now be done by fitter hands,' said Selden, as, followed by his men, he passed on to the main apartment. On reaching the room they found the girls, as the widow had named, stationed before the rude fire place. Alma was sitting upon a block in an attitude which would enable her to hear the least sound connected with the hollow trunk above; while her more volatile companion, having chosen the part of sentry, was silently walking back and forth before the hearth with the widow's rifle in her hand. Non was this weapon their only dependence: a quantity of loose straw was lying in the fire place, and a slow burning torch was at hand to apply and set the combustible material into a blaze the instant any one should attempt to enter the cavity above. `Bravo! ladies,' exclaimed Selden, as he approached. `I don't now remember me,' he continued, eying Jessy archly, `to have seen so heroic a display of this character since whilom at the bloody siege of the Lower Falls.' `Now, Captain Selden,' replied the other with a half resentful, half deprecating look, `if you ever mention that affair again, I will never—positively— never forgive you. Besides, how can you feel like joking at such an hour as this?' `For ourselves we tremble not,' interposed Miss Hendee, rising and turning to Selden with her usual calm dignity of manner; `but think of that distressed mother and her helpless family, upon whose heads we have brought this fearful peril!' `Heaven forbid that we should be unmindful of them,' rejoined the young leader, seriously, `and believe me, Miss Hendee, there is not a man,—not a single man of us here, who, if need be, would hesitate to shed his heart's blood in her defence. But we will now relieve you of your charge here, ladies. Retire, then, and, if possible, to rest and slumber; for I well know your exhausted systems must, by this time, require both. Go, girls,' he added, conducting them to the entrance of the passage leading to the apartment of their hostess, `go, —keep up bright hopes, and rely on our disposition and ability to defend you.' As soon as the ladies had retired, a guard was selected to supply the place they had just relinquished, and another was ordered to relieve Captain Hendee and his faithful attendant at the western entrance. The remainder of the men, glad to seize every moment offered them for rest, mostly threw themselves upon the earthy floor, and fell asleep, while Selden and Captain Hendee, willing to leave them to what repose they might thus snatch from the duties to which they were liable the next instant to be called, repaired to the small partitioned room adjoining, to hold a consultation, and be ready for any movements which might be made by their persevering foes. A brief interval of comparative silence now succeeded, in which nothing was to be heard below but the deep, heavy snoring of the wearied men, and the low, dull roaring of the flames above. Slight jarrings of the earth, however, showing that the enemy were again in motion, at length began to be perceptible below; and soon the unexpected sounds of the blows of axes or hatchets were added to other indications of some fresh project about to be attempted by the besiegers, the nature and object of which the besieged had now no means of ascertaining. `Now that jests settles the question; for I'll be blest if I stand it any longer,' exclaimed Jones, who had for some time manifested signs of uneasiness as he sat listening to the movements above ground, and who now, as the last sounds struck his ear, sprang upon his feet, and began, with restless steps, to pace the apartment. `To be cribbed and holed up here like so many hunted foxes, with forty divils over our heads, who may be preparing to send down one of those great hemlocks to smush us like migets, for any thing we know, or fixing some other contrivance for us not much better, and all without allowing us 21 the least chance to know the how, when and whereabouts, is a thing I don't fancy. And if I can get out there at the creek, I swow by Lucifer's red taffeta jacket, I'll jest know what they are up to there above ground.' `What do you propose to do, Jones?' asked Selden, who, overhearing part of the scout's soliloquy, now entered the room; `not to go out, and alone, surely?' `I reckon I jest do, Captain—that is, unless you swear right down I shant.' `But consider the danger of its leading to a discovery of our refuge, and the fearful personal risk you must encounter.' `And then again consider the chance that the satans have smelt out that secret already, or, at the best, that they will, when the house falls in, and they find we an't there. And as to my own risk in the matter, I think you hadn't ought to grumble much, if I don't, considering,' said the scout taking the other's remarks for a consent to his proposed excursion, and moving towards the entrance. `Jones, you shall not go alone—it shall never be said I suffered that,' said Selden, calling after the scout, and snatching up a rifle and following him into the passage. Although Selden had given way to the proposal of the scout with a mind nearly balanced between the dangers which might be averted, and those which might be incurred by the measure, yet having once decided to permit and take part in it himself, he threw aside all his doubts, and proceeded to carry it into instant execution. And having ordered the guard at this post to be doubled, and leaving the command with Captain Hendee to act as circumstances should dictate, the two adventurers removed a portion of the blockwork at the mouth of the passage sufficient for an egress, crept cautiously and silently out into the open air, and soon gained the top of the bank above, unmolested. Here they paused a moment to listen and reconnoiter; and perceiving no signs of the presence of any enemy, except in the immediate vicinity of the burning tenement, and being thus relieved from their fears of an ambush at this spot, which they considered the greatest personal hazard that they would be likely to incur, they again set forward towards the scene of action, by separate and slightly diverging routs, under the agreement that each should return by himself, and as speedily as possible, after obtaining the best knowledge of the situation and movements of the enemy of which the case would admit. Carefully keeping within the shadow of a tree or bush, lest the light of the conflagration, which was brightly illuminating every open space in the woods around, should expose him to the view of the enemy, Selden, after leaving his companion, crawled noiselessly on to the border of the woods, where he soon succeeded in gaining a position in a thick clump of low evergreens, which luckily afforded him every chance he could wish for observation. The greater part of the enemy were still at their stations a short distance from the house, where they stood peering over their coverts with their guns leveled at the door, which they were evidently each moment expecting to see thrown open by the besieged, whom the flames, they supposed, must soon drive from the house. A small band were busily engaged in the edge of the woods, some eight or ten rods to his left, in trimming out with their hatchets a small spruce tree, which they had just cut down, and which, he at once concluded, was to be used as another battering ram, the former one being found by them, probably, too unwiedly for their purpose. While Selden stood making these observations, he heard the steps and voices of persons in the open grounds, apparently approaching from the spot at which the engine was preparing, and, turning his head, he was soon enabled to see two men coming from a nook in the clearing some rods to his left, of which his situation had not permitted him a full view. Passing along near the woods they soon came between him and the burning pile, when they slackened their pace; and finally coming to a stand a little to his right, they turned their faces towards the fire. With the first flash of light that fell upon their features, Selden instantly recognized in one of them, Sherwood, the leader of the band. The other he rightly judged to be Darrow, the reckless minion of the former. Selden's rifle was instinctively brought to his face with an aim at Sherwood's heart, and his finger was feeling for the trigger, when prudence overcame the temptation of ending the life of the villain, and slowly and reluctantly lowering his piece, he gave his attention to the dialogue which now ensued between these two worthies. `Yes, the tables are now turned, Darrow,' were the first words that became distinctly audible to our listener: `We have now, singularly enough, chased them round nearly to the spot where this same accursed Selden was one of the foremost of the gang to have me tied up and whipped like some scurvy thief. And if he is the same fellow you saw in the woods near Crown Point'— `That I can swear to.' `And if you are right in your suspicions as to the other particular'— `I am more and more convinced of it, Jake.' `Well, I got one glance at his features to day, and come to look at him with that object, I swear, I believe you are right; and if so, both interest and revenge demands his death while he is in our power. But I should prefer to have this brought about before they surrender; and that was the reason of my particular orders to the men to pick him off as soon as possible.' `Yes, and how the devil it has happened, that he has so long escaped the effects of that order is more than I can tell. I have had four fair shots at the fellow myself in the course of the chase to day; and two or three of the men say they have tried it with the same luck. He stands fire like a salamander,' added the ruffian with a ferocious grin at his own wit, `and, by hell! I am beginning to think they are all of that sort of animals, to stand it out there in the flames at this rate.' `Well, the worst is there own, damn 'em,' rejoined Sherwood, with a demoniac laugh; `and if they do get baked a little, it is no more than they deserve. But the fact is, they must have been driven out long ago, if they had not contrived some way to keep out the flames—the one, probably, which I suggested, that of bringing earth from the cellar and strewing it over the upper floor.' `And still they must know that in fifteen minutes more they will all be buried beneath a blazing log-heap.' `True; and I am surprized, I will own, that they don't throw open the door and call for quarters. But we will now very soon save them the trouble, as I 21* see our men are just starting with their battering pole to beat in the door.' `I see, and I am glad they have got it under weigh, at last; for that will tell the story devilish quick; and to tell the truth, Jake, I am plaguy suspicious of some trick about this business.' `Well, if there is, this will be the best way to discover it; but had not you better go and take the command?' `No, Remington will know how to manage.' `Have you given him and the men their orders?' `Yes,—to let drive at the door with all vengeance.' `And in case they rush out?' `Why, shoot down the men, and spare the women for our use.' `And supposing they cry for quarters?' `Remington is to grant them; but three or four of such marksmen as he shall select are not to understand the order till they have dropped Selden on your account, the old Captain on mine, and that long legged devil who has settled the fate of so many of their companions to day, on their own.' `All right, Darrow; but come, let us move a little to the south, where we can get a fairer view of the door, when they make the trial, and where, at the same time, we shall be out of the range of the bullets, should the rascals be desperate enough to attempt to fire upon us again.' It was with no small effort that Selden restrained himself from taking immediate vengeance on the black hearted villain before him, as he listened in silence to the foregoing dialogue, and discovered the extent of his diabolical designs. The consciousness, however, that the lives of many,—and among them one whose life was dearer to him than his own--might be endangered by the act, enabled him to master his feelings to the end of the discourse. And the objects of his indignation having now withdrawn themselves from his view, he gave his attention, in common with his foes, to the operations about to be commenced on the house, being anxious to witness the result, to see to what discoveries it might lead, and to what new movements it might give rise, among the enemy, before retreating from the ground: nor had he to wait long for that object. The new battering implement, when once fairly placed upon the shoulders of the party immediately in charge of it, was borne round to the front side of the house, where it was transferred to the shoulders of those selected to employ it against the door. For the next succeeding moment, as the engine was being poised and directed to the object of its aim, a breathless silence ensued, broken only by the sharp clicking of cocking rifles, now heard in every direction, while the dark forms of the enemy were seen slinking behind the different objects of the lighted landscape, and protruding their long death-commissioned tubes, in readiness for the expected rush of the besieged from the house the instant the interior should be laid open. `All ready?—ahead with it, then!' now shouted the infamous villain to whom the command of the assaulting party had been entrusted—`ahead with it, as if the devil drove it an end!' Starting at the word, the men shot forward the butt end of their engine with a desperate effort towards its object. It struck; and the massy door flew nearly to the opposite wall of the blazing interior; while the sides of the fabrick, already loosened, and about to separate at the corners, from the action of the fire, after tottering a moment at the violent jar imparted by the blow, gradually swayed inward, and finally came down in a mass of red ruins over the cellar, sending up to the tops of the neighboring trees a broad gush of flames, that flashed far and wide over the surrounding wilderness. The enemy, to whom this result was wholly unexpected, looked on in mute astonishment, not unmingled, apparently, with some feelings of horror at the terrific fate, which they took for granted had befallen every soul of the besieged. `The devil!' at length exclaimed Sherwood, awakening from the stupor of the surprize, into which he seemed to have been thrown by the event —`so they have all gone to hell together!' `That don't follow, by a damned sight!' bluntly replied Darrow. `What do you mean by that, Bill?' asked the former, turning hastily, and with an air of concern, to his minion. `They have escaped, Jake!' `In the name of hell, how?' `Don't know; but depend on't they have. Why, do you think them such cursed fools as to stay there to be roasted alive, when the worst they could fear from rushing out would be the ten fold preferable death by the bullet? Never! I tell you they have found some way of escape—probably by a drain, or passage from the cellar into the woods. It began to creep through my hair some time ago, but you was so confident'— `Damnation seize me for a dolt!' exclaimed the enraged leader. `Ho! there, men, the game has slipped through our fingers—to the woods! to the woods for the trail!' he added, springing forward himself to take the lead in the execution of the order. And so sudden, and unexpected was the movement, that before Selden had become fairly aware of the dangers of his situation, Sherwood and Darrow had entered the woods but a few rods to the South, and were rapidly approaching the spot where he stood concealed. Deeming it impossible now to retreat for his refuge undetected, and thinking there might be a chance that they would pass by without discovering him, which would still leave him time to escape before others of the enemy could arrive, he prepared his arms, and silently awaited the approach of these two deadliest of his foes. They came nearly abreast of him, and were passing by, when the motion of his shadow, which was cast by the bright flames of the burning pile across their path, caught their sight, and caused them to stop short. Turning round for the object, their eyes fell upon the other, and they gazed at him an instant in evident doubt and surprise. `The very fellow, by hell!' eagerly muttered Darrow, in an undertone to his companion. All three simultaneously raised their weapons and fired. But in taking a hasty step forward, Selden's foot, as fortunately for him, perhaps, as for one of his foes, became entangled in a small bush, and, in the act of discharging his piece, he fell to the ground. The bullets of his foes whistled harmlessly over his head, while his own, for the same reason, missed the object of its aim. Leaping forward in the smoke, the desperadoes both grappled with their unprepared antagonist before he could gain his footing, and, throwing him back upon the ground, drew their knives to dispatch him. As Selden was about to shut his eyes in anticipation of the fatal blow, he caught a glimpse of the well known figure of the tall scout coming with tremendous bounds to the spot. And the next instant, Darrow, as he turned, and was starting up at the unexpected apparition, received a blow over his head and shoulders from the clubbed rifle of the former, that sent him reeling to the earth; while Sherwood was seized by the same powerful hand, and dashed against a tree with a force that laid him nearly senseless by the side of his disabled companion. The surprise of Jones was equalled only by his joy, as Selden, whom he supposed at least badly wounded, and whom he was about to grasp and bear off in his arms, now sprang upon his feet unhurt, and drawing his rapier, turned to add the finishing blow to his two still prostrate, but fast reviving antagonists. At that instant the shout of rallying foes, hurrying to the rescue, and already entering the border of the woods not twenty yards distant, broke upon their ears, warning them of the necessity of immediate flight. `By Moses! we must leg it, Captain,' said the scout, as reluctantly relinquishing their object, they both darted away from the spot, and, throwing each a tree in the range behind him, commenced a rapid retreat towards the refuge they had just left. In another moment they had reached the creek, thrown themselves over the bank, entered the passage, and were in the embrace of their alarmed and anxious friends, while the woods above were resounding with the hideous yells of the disappointed foe, running about in search of the missing objects of their rage. Our band, having but little reason to hope that their retreat would now long remain undiscovered, immediately set about such preparations as were deemed necessary for its defence. The short timbers, composing the barrier near the mouth of the passage, were more firmly secured; while convenient loop holes were formed by raising some of the upper timbers and inserting, at intervals, flat stones between them. An efficient guard, with muskets and fixed bayonets, were then stationed at the spot, the charge of which was entrusted to the brave and trusty scout. This and the other arrangements being completed, they awaited in silent anxiety the approaching crisis of their fate, all intently listening from the different stations allotted them in the rooms, or along the passages, for some sound which should indicate in what shape and direction the expected assault was to be made. They were not long left in suspense. The sound of suppressed and eager voices, and cautiously treading feet fast gathering on the bank above, soon apprised them, that the entrance to their retreat was discovered. For some time, however, the enemy seemed wary and fearful about showing their persons in front of the passage. But after appearing to listen awhile, first one, and then another, ventured out abreast of the barricade across the passage, which was situated about a yard from its mouth. In the mean time, Jones and his men stood within, holding their breath in motionless silence, with their bayonets in their loops, and their eyes eagerly fixed on their marked victims, who, feeling their dark way with the muzzles of their guns, were slowly and cautiously approaching within reach of the murderous blades of those of whose dangerous proximity they were wholly unaware. The assailants, now striking the barricade with their guns, paused, and seemed to hesitate; but after again listening a moment, they withdrew their pieces, and coming up to the timbers, were beginning to feel with their hands, apparently to ascertain the nature of the obstruction; when the death-doing bayonets were suddenly thrust forth, and, with horrid shrieks, the pierced and recoiling wretches sprang back, and fell over with a heavy splash into the water below. Warned by the fearful reception of their comrades, the enemy ventured not again to appear before the mouth of the passage, but soon retired from the bank, and for a long time gave the besieged no further cause of alarm. So profoundly still, indeed, was all above, that our little garrison at length entertained a strong hope that their assailants, grown wise by the lessons they had already received, had given up their design, and made a final retreat from the place. The soldiers gradually relaxed from that stern and determined air which the exigencies of their situation had thrown over their war-worn visages, and began to exchange the careless remark or sportive jest. Mrs. Story and the other females, venturing from their secluded refuge, came out into the main room to hear from their gallant defenders a recital of the various occurrences of the night, to the deadened and imperfect sounds of which they had been listening for many hours with the most painful anxiety. These were accordingly narrated. And every individual feat accomplished, or peril encountered, was made the theme of praise or gratulation to the different actors of the occasion; while to wind up, Pete Jones, with his characteristic waggish gravity, displayed to the astonished ladies his bullet-riddled coat as a proof that his case afforded a climax to all the hair-breadth escapes of the night. As the attention of the company was thus engaged, and at the instant when the eyes of all, including those set to guard against the descent of the foe down the hollow stub before described, were turned upon the scout, a savage warrior dropped silently upon the hearth, and rearing himself partially from his crouching attitude, and throwing a keen, rapid glance around the apartment, glided swiftly through the assembled group, and darted into the dark passage leading into the interior room, where the children were left unguarded. So sudden, so noiseless and shadow-like, had he entered, passed through them, and disappeared, that few heeded, and still fewer became fully aware of the character of the apparition. The eagle-eyed vigilance of the mother was not, however, thus to be eluded. She caught a glimpse of the flitting form of the savage, as he entered the passage, and, with the heart rending exclamation, “My children! Oh! my children!” she sprang forward, like a maddened tigress, and disappeared in the passage after him. `A light! follow instantly with a light!' shouted Selden, drawing his sword and rushing into the dark avenue to defend or rescue the frantic mother and her periled children from the deadly knife of their merciless foe. He had scarcely passed the entrance, however, before he was met by the intrepid woman, dragging back, with resistless force, the struggling savage, who had been overtaken while groping his uncertain way onward, and seized round the waist from behind by the desperately grasping arms of his captor. He had just succeeded in unsheathing his knife, which was fiercely glittering in the light of the advancing torch, as it rose and fell in quickly repeated, but as yet ineffectual, passes at 22 her body. A glance sufficed to show the young leader the imminent danger of his unheeding hostess, and, with the next breath, his weapon was sent to the hilt into the body of the screeching foe. `Thank God! thank God!' hurriedly ejaculated the nearly breathless and exhausted woman, casting from her, with a shudder, the gasping and gory corpse, which, as she now turned and hastened back to comfort her alarmed but untouched children, was drawn away and covered up in a corner. While this was taking place, Jones had placed a quantity of the combustible material, already prepared for such an emergency, in the fire place, and applied the torch. And by the time Selden had taken breath after his exploit, so as to turn his attention to other objects, the rapidly kindling flames were beginning to flash and roar along up the cavity above. `That was well thought of, Jones,' said the latter, approaching the scout, who had dropped on one knee in the corner of the fire place, and was intently listening to such sounds as he could distinguish in the chimney above, amidst the roaring of the fire,—`well thaught of; but what do you hear up chimney?' `Why,' replied the scout, rising at the approach of his superior, `I got down there to see if I could find out whether there were any more of these visitors coming down the hollow, thinking that the way they would scratch and scrumble up back again, when the smoke and blaze met 'em, would be a curiosity.' `And what did you discover?' `Jest nothing but unsartinty. Though from some noises that reached me, I rather guess there was one or more of the scamps at the top of the stub, harking down, and waiting to see how the first one got on, before venturing; but that want what I was at, when you spoke'— `Well, what was it, then?' `Why, I should rather guess there was a considerable party standing not far from over us, now, kinder consulting, or mayhap waiting to have some contrivances made, as the rest appear to be at work with their hatchets round in the woods as busy as the divil in a gale of wind.' `Ha! what now?—feeling trees upon us?' `No—lighter work than that—and, I'm thinking whether it an't sharpening stakes, or possibly hewing out wooden shovels. But hush! hark!' Every voice was instantly hushed at the ominous words and manner of the scout; and as the room became silent, the sounds that had attracted his attention became distinctly audible to the whole company: at first was heard a distant trampling of feet, apparently approaching with slow, irregular movement, from all directions towards them. Nearer and nearer they came, pausing every few steps, and stamping heavily upon the earth as they continued gradually to close up to that portion of the surface which extended over the room where our intrepid little band stood silently awaiting the result of this new movement, the object of which, they soon conjectured, was to ascertain, by sounding the earth, the exact position of their place of concealment before attempting to dig or otherwise effect a breach through the surface. In a moment more the advancing lines reached the verge of the solid earth, on either side, and began to step over the boundary upon the hollow ground above the room; when, seeming to become aware of the fact, they suddenly paused, exchanged a few words, and commenced a furious stamping over the whole space covering the excavation beneath. As the trembling earth gave back the hollow sound, thus affording unequivocal evidence that the place of their search was at length discovered, they rised a fierce yell of exultation, and fell to work with their hatchets, and such rude implements as they had hastily prepared for the purpose, in cutting away the roots, and loosening and removing the earth in such places as they had selected for effecting openings. As soon as it was fairly ascertained that the enemy had commenced operations for effecting a breach through the earth above, our band, with one consent, ceased listening, and began to prepare for action. Every one seemed fully sensible that a fearful crisis was now indeed at hand, and carefully examining their arms to see that every thing was in readiness for instant action, they arranged themselves, at the command of their leader, in lines around the sides of the room, while, in the compressed lip and sternly knitting brows of each, was depicted the deeply breathed resolution to fight to the death in defence of themselves and the fair and tender ones whose only hope was now in their bravery. `Give me a place among you,' cried the intrepid widow, at this moment emerging from the inner room, armed with her rifle and equipped for battle, `give me a place, and see whether I am the first to desert the post of danger.' `But madam, dear madam,' began to expostulate Selden, `do you know the peril that now awaits us? Do you hear the sound of those busy fiends, belaboring the earth above to break through upon us? and, there! do you see those fragments falling from that jarring and trembling ceiling? Are you aware that in ten minutes'— `I have heard all—I see, and know all,' interrupted the woman, in tones of desperate calmness; `I am prepared for the worst. I can never live to see my children murdered before my eyes. Here,' she continued, planting herself at the entrance of the passage, `here I will remain, and if the enemy enter here, it shall be over my dead body. Nay, not a word, Captain Selden, I will not be denied.' At this moment Miss Hendee and Miss Reed glided past the widow into the room, and with looks yet unmoved by the danger, which they well understood now menaced every individual of the company, presented themselves before the admiring gaze of the soldiers. `Ah! girls, you missed the tread of your centinel, did you? I meant to have escaped you unnoticed,' said the widow with a melancholy smile. `Aware that the hour decisive of the fate of us all had arrived, we came to see if we could be of any service here, or elsewhere,' replied Alma, in a firm, but serious tone. `God bless you, noble girls!' said Selden, with emotion, advancing to the side of his lovely and heroic friends: `God bless you for this fortitude and self sacrificing bravery.' `Oh! let me die by your side,' murmured Jessy, dropping her head on Selden's bosom. Touched by this exhibition, so gratifying to his feelings as a lover, and to his pride as a soldier, the hero, gently putting her from him, gazed an instant on the slight, symmetrical form, and the beautiful and soul-speaking features of the fond and spirited young 22* creature before him, with the mingled look which imagination would naturally ascribe to a worshiper of the goddess beauty, while kneeling at the shrine of her image, and proffering the strangely blended adorations which the nature of that worship must necessarily have inspired. `No, no Jessy,' he at length replied, arousing himself from the momentary entrancement: `No, girls, you two, at least, may not—must not remain: to say nothing of the perils you must encounter, your presence here might more embarrass than aid us. Retire, then, and trust to us, under Providence, for your deliverance. `Is your father a sleep, Alma?' asked the widow, as the young ladies were leaving the room. `He is,' was the reply: `for, though when he came to our room, and threw himself down among the children to try to get a little sleep, he desired me to awaken him on the occurrence of any new danger, I yet could not find it in my heart to disturb him so soon.' `Let him be instantly awakened,' said Selden, `I would have his counsel.' In a few moments Captain Hendee, who, nearly ready to sink under the fatigues of the day, had retired to the inner room in the interval of quiet which followed the repulse of the enemy at the western entrance, had made his appearance. A glance at the ceiling, now visibly shaking in two different places under the rapidly progressing operations of the foe above, enabled him, with the hasty intimations just imparted by his daughter, to comprehend at once the situation of both besiegers and besieged. `This is a strait to which I both feared and expected we should be finally reduced,' he remarked coolly, after a momentary pause, `but let no man despair; I have been in situations more hopeless than this, and yet escaped.' `We can at least sell our lives dearly,' responded Selden. `True,' replied the old veteran thoughtfully, `even in the method of defence which I see, from your arrangement, you propose to adopt,—that of shooting the assailants as they attempt to enter the breaches that they may make. But will you be able thus to repel them long? Every foot of this earthy covering, which now protects us from their bullets, may be removed, or beat in upon us, before we can bring our guns to bear upon them with effect. And every surrounding tree top will, by that time, conceal a foe, ready to send us death from above; while fire brands and combustibles will be hurled down upon us by those remaining on the ground. And if we retreat into our narrow passages, as we must, the same game will follow us there.' `All these hazards, Captain Hendee,' replied the young leader, `I am fully aware we may encounter. But what other mode of defence can we adopt?— A sally from the western entrance, which is now doubtless closely guarded by the enemy, with the expectation that we shall soon be driven to make it, must prove fatal to all who shall attempt it; while the entrance at the other end of the passage is blocked up by a red mass of burning ruins. What other expedient, then, is left for us.' `I had thought of one,' said Captain Hendee, with some hesitation. `I had thought of one, as our last resort, in an emergency like this. It may not be without risk to ourselves, I am aware, but,' he continued, with fiercely flashing eyes, `but it must be swift destruction to the accursed gang above, who are thirsting for our blood!' `In the name of heaven, declare it, then,' eager-cried Selden, casting an uneasy glance at some fresh demonstrations of the progress of the foe in the covering above. `I will—here, this way,' replied the former, as stepping across the room, he opened the concealed recess in the wall, and disclosed the widow's magazine to the wondering gaze of Selden and his men, who being ignorant of its existence, did not at once understand the nature of its contents, or perceive the old gentleman's object in displaying it. `There!' he addded, significantly pointing to the heads of the casks thus brought to view, `there! that explains my plan.' How? What do those barrels contain?' rapidly demanded Selden, with the varying expression of doubt, surprise and alarm. `Gunpowder!' was the emphatic reply. `Good God! Captain Hendee, do you consider our case so desperate, that, Samson-like, we should all perish with our foes?' `It does not follow that we shall perish with them. I have seen somewhat of the operation of exploding mines, and cannot believe that the effects in the proposed one can reach far into that winding passage, to the further end of which, if thought safer than the inner room, we can all repair.' `I'll be blest if I don't think the old thrash-the divil is about right, Captain Selden,' exclaimed Pete Jones, leaping about and snapping his fingers in great glee. `Jest place them in that corner beyond the fire there, and it must be a sort of powder that I'm not much acquainted with, if it turns at a right angle very far into that passage after mischief. Well, now, the Lord be thanked for putting this into your noddle, old friend; I had about agreed to say gone dogs for us all, but now I can see a considerable sprinkling of hope through them barrels of thunder yonder.' `And you, Mrs. Story, whose stake is the greatest in the result,' said Selden, turning to the widow, after hastily running his eye over the different parts of the room, as if calculating the probable extent to which the explosion would affect the earth laterally,—`what do you say to the measure?' `I don't know—I don't know,' replied the distressed mother, who had been mutely listening to the startling proposition in a sort of wild amazement. `The work of the element will be terrific— perhaps fatal to us—but the work of the exasperated foe, unless thus destroyed, will be, I fear, for all we can do, no less dreadful. I leave it to you, and may God direct the course which shall be for our good,' she added with a shudder. `It is a fearful experiment, but it shall be tried,' said the young leader, turning away to begin the required arrangement. At that instant a large fragment of earth was suddenly ruptured from the ceiling, and fell heavily to the floor, scattering dirt in every direction around, and disclosing in the place, from which it had been detached, the point of a huge sharpened stake, protruding several inches into the room; while the wild and exultant shouting of the foe above, as the stake was drawn up, and the redoubled fury with which they renewed their exertions, all loudly warned our band that there was no time to be lost in preparing for the execution of their purpose. `Clear the room instantly!' cred Selden, in low, but startling accents, `back! back! every man of you, but Jones, to the further end of the passage— no remonstrance—no offers!' he continued, as urging them with drawn sword from the room, several began to persuade him to permit them to incur the hazard of exploding the fatal mine, `not a word! The match shall be applied by my own hand.' As soon as the room was fairly cleared, Selden turned, and, with rapid steps, proceeded to the recess, drew forth the barrels, and carrying them to the corner opposite to the entrance of the inner passage, placed them firmly, and pulled out the bungs, allowing a quantity of the powder to run out from each on to the ground. He then laid a small continuous train of dry powder, extending from the barrels across the room into the entrance in question; while the scout, by his orders, after having removed the lights to a safe distance, wet a cartridge from the contents of his canteen, and hastily converted it into a slow match to apply to the end of the train. `There! now leave the rest to me, Jones, take care of yourself, and see that the passage is kept clear for my retreat,' said the leader, receiving a torch which was brought him by the other, and taking his station to await the fearful moment of firing the train. The enemy in the mean time were making rapid progress. Two breaches were already made through the earth into the room, and these, as was evinced by the almost constant falling of heavy masses of dirt, were every moment widening; while from the trampling of feet, all gathering up to the spot, the mingled shouts, curses and commands of the infuriated gang and their leaders, it was obvious that an attempt to descend was about to be made. At this moment they seemed to perceive that the besieged had deserted their room and retreated further into the earth. Grown madly desperate by being already so long baffled, and doubly infuriated by the discovery that their intended victims had still a further refuge, they were now heard hastily throwing aside their tools and resuming their arms preparatory to entering the breach to follow up the pursuit, little dreaming in the hellish joy of their anticipated revenge, that the torch was even then suspended over the train, and waiting only their first movement, to send them, in an instant, with all the passions of fiends raging in their bosoms, unannealed into the presence of their God. But while the foe-trampled earth was jarring to the hiedious tumult above, the silence of death prevailed through the hushed vaults beneath. The agitated mother was breathing hurried ejaculations over her clasped children. And near her might be seen the huddling forms of her shuddering female companions, with their fair hands tightly compressed over both ears and eyes, as if to shut out from their recoiling senses the noise of the now momentarily expected explosion; while the men in the dark passage beyond, stood motionless and silent, listening in the attitude of intensely excited expectation for the awful denoument. Selden, in the mean while, hesitating between his fears, that the train would get disturbed by the entrance of the foe into the room, and his anxiety to have the band gather over, or so closely around it, as to bring them all within the reach of the explosion, still held the torch suspended in his extended hand over the train, now lowering the point of the low flickering brand nearly to a contact with the powder, at some indication of the expected descent; and now hastily withdrawing it, as other and less decisive sounds reached his ear. His hesitation, however, was soon ended: at that instant a loud yell at the western entrance, and the sounds of thickly trampling feet that followed, told him that the enemy had forced the barrier at the end of that passage, and were rushing into the room; while another hurra from the tories above, and the heavy, and quickly repeated jar of feet, striking upon the floor which accompanied it, further announced, that the latter were beginning to leap down the breaches to join the former in the assault. At this critical instant, and before the mingled war cry of the savage and tory had died away in the echoing vaults beyond him, the young leader applied the brand to the fuse, and was rapidly retreating along the passage towards his friends. Having reached the curtained recess containing the women and children, and here encountering Captain Hendee and Jones, he turned round, and with them, awaited, with palpitating heart and suspended breath, the fearful result. With the low hissing sound of the slowly burning match, came a cry of horror from the scrambling foe, over whose minds, now for the first time, seemed to flash the dreadful truth. But too late. The next instant, with a concussion that almost threw Selden and his companions from their feet, the earth yawned and opened along the passage overhead nearly to the spot where they stood; when, through the long vibrating chasm, was displayed to their appalled vision, the broad space of tree-covered earth over and around the room beyond, leaping, in disrupturing masses into the air, along with the diverging column of fiercely shooting smoke and flame, in which were seen, commingling with rocks, earth, and the limbs and trunks of uprooted and swiftly revolving trees, a score of human forms, wildly throwing out their arms as if for aid, and distending their mouths with unheard screeches, as, with blackened and distorted features and dissevering limbs, they were borne upwards with amazing force in the flaming mass to the heavens. The chasm slowly closed over the astounded but unharmed band, and shut out from their reeling senses the deafening din that was breaking in crashing thunders above. A momentary stillness ensued; when the returning shower of ruins came thundering to the earth; after which, all again relapsed into a death-like, and unbroken silence. Once more the morning light was springing in the golden chambers of the east, heralding the approach of the fiery coursers of the Day God up the glowing pathway of the sky. More and more brightly broke the suffusing radiance over the mountains, darkly gleaming, at first, upon the quiet surface of the gently flowing Otter, and then, gradually lighting up, one after another, the bolder features of the altered landscape, till the whole scene of the last night's thrilling drama, and its awful catastrophe, stood revealed to the sight. The humble tenement of the lone widow, which the last setting sun left standing unmolested, in her toil-wrought opening in the wilderness, had disappeared; and in its place lay a pile of black and smouldering ruins. Fences were thrown down and scattered in every direction; while the growing crops in the fields around, reared 23 by the hard labors of the indefatigable occupant, and constituting her sole dependence for the future sustenance of her numerous family, were scorched and withered by the falling cinders thrown up from the burning house, or prostrated and beat into the earth by the trampling feet of reckless foes. The breath of war had, indeed, passed over every thing, and her little all, in one short night, had perished. Near the banks of the stream, where stood a thick growth of trees over and around the main apartment of the subterraneous abode, now yawned a huge, black chasm in the ground, in which scarcely a trace of the late regular room was discernable; while the burnt and discoloured bark and foliage, marking the standing forest around, and the broken, splintered and uprooted trees, which had been hurled outward and prostrated with the earth for many rods in every direction from the spot, and which were now lying strewed over the ground in wild disorder, intermingled with smoking rubbish, all told the fearful power and extent of the terrific explosion. Half buried among the wide scattered ruins lay the torn, mangled and blackened corses of savage and tory,—the fated victims of the mine, which had so suddenly, so unexpectedly, sprung beneath their feet, sweeping them, in an instant, indiscriminately away, with the cries of anticipated victory and vengeance on their lips, like chaff in a whirlwind of fire. As the increasing day-light began to fall more broadly upon this scene of death and desolation, two human forms might have been seen cautiously breaking through the loose earth that closed up the mouth of the long passage into which our little band last retreated. The small, topling head, crane-like neck, long body and limbs, and the peculiarly rapid and shambling movements of the one, as, now crouching, now rearing his tall form aloft and throwing quick and wary glances around him, he glided round beneath the sides of the broad black pit into which they had emerged, sufficiently announced him as the uncomparable scout. The swarthy and immovable features, the short figure, and deliberate air of the other, proclaimed him also to be an old acquaintance of the reader, the trusty and faithful Neshobee. Creeping out of the excavation, the two seperated, and quickly disappeared in opposite directions in the woods and bushes along the banks of the creek. After the lapse of half an hour, in which they had apparently made a reconnoitering circuit round the opening, they reappeared on the banks of the excavation, communed a moment, and, throwing aside the air of caution that had marked their movements, approached, with bold and confident steps, towards the choked entrance, through which they had forced their way into the open air. `Hurra, there, below!' shouted Pete, dropping on one knee, and poking his head and long neck into the dark hole before him, `hurra! ye poor half smuddered divils—asking the Captain's pardon for the freedom—do you hear?' `Ay, ay! what report—what news from the regions above?' responded several voices from the dark, and, till then, silent recesses within. `The coast is as clear as a hound's tooth,' replied the scout. `Yes, all clear, and that, too, with what I should call a considerable of a vengeance: so just troop along out here, and see what God put it into men's heads to make gunpowder for.' This announcement seemed to produce an instant effect. A lively bustle was immediately heard among the party below. And in a few moments more, the men, followed by the women and children, came creeping, one by one, from their crowded and uncomfortable retreat, looking worn, haggard and pale from fatigue, and more especially from the want of fresh air, with which they had but imperfectly supplied themselves by digging, with their bayonets, small holes through the earthy covering of their refuge to the surface above. After reaching the open air, the company stood a moment on the banks of the chasm, viewing in silent horror the awful spoctacle that was here presented to their sight; when, at the suggestion of Selden, the females, accompanied by himself, and all but the common soldiers, (who were busy in searching for guns and other spoiles among the ruins,) hastened to leave a scene so revolting to the senses. And making the best of their way over the tangled mass that every where encircled the spot, with many a shudder at the disfigured, and sometimes limbless bodies of the slain, for which they were often compelled to turn aside in their route, they proceed towards the open grounds in front of the scite lately occupied by the house. `Umph! look! jus look um up there!' exclaimed Neshobee, eagerly pointing up the trunk of a large dry hemlock, which, standing some half dozen rods from the seat of the explosion, the company were unobservantly passing. Arrested by the unusually excited manner of the Indian, the whole party suddenly paused, and looked upward in search of the object to which he was so earnestly directing their attention. About half way up the tree, the doubling body of a man hung dangling in the air, from a short pointed limb, upon which he had evidently been thrown from the earth, and literally impaled through the middle, by the force of the explosion. His cadaverous face was turned full towards the company, and a glance at the peculiar cast of his death-set features explained at once, to Captain Hendee and the girls, the cause of the wild and gleeful interest manifested by the native: it was the traitor, Remington, who first betrayed the family to their enemies, and who was afterwards discovered to be in full league with Sherwood and Darrow, and, to the last, in active cooperation with them, in the black designs which they supposed themselves on the eve of accomplishing, when thus awfully arrested in their guilty career. Awe-struck and appalled at the strange and dreadful fate of the villain, the company, with one consent, turned away from the sickening sight, and, hastening from the spot, pursued their way in thoughtful silence, till they had passed, as they supposed, beyond the scene of these multiplied horrors. Another trial, however, though of a different and mingled character, still awaited them: a deep groan, issuing from a small covert on their left, now reached their ears, and caused them again to pause in their steps. `It is a human groan,' said Selden, `and doubtless that of some poor wounded wretch, who has crawled away from the scene of action. Perhaps his life may yet be saved,' he added, as, beckoning to Jones, he promptly set out for the place from which the sound had proceeded. As the two passed round to the spot, they discovered a man lying in a state of almost utter exhaustion in the weeds behind a long log, by which he had apparently been arrested in his course while trying to reach a small 23* brook a few rods beyond. His face, with every other exposed part of his person, was thickly besmeared with dirt, gunpowder and blood, which last was still freshly oozing from his mangled and broken legs; and it was only by his hair, and the remains of his burnt and tattered dress, that he could be distinguished as a white man. He seemed to be aware of the presence of others, and his lips began to move with some inaudible request. `The poor creature is begging for water,' said Selden, lowering his ear over the face of the invalid: `let us remove him to the brook.' Raising him carefully in their arms, they accordinly bore him to the bank of the rivulet, and having placed him in a sitting position, with his back against a large stump, they applied a gourdshell of water to his lips, of which he drank eagerly and deeply. They then washed the blood and dirt from his face, when he considerably revived; and opening his eyes, he looked up in evident surprise on our party, all of whom, having gathered round him, now stood viewing his gory and lacerated limbs in silent commiseration. `Why! it is Darrow—the wretched and guilty Darrow!' exclaimed Miss Hendee, starting back in surprise, and with an expression of mingled pity and abhorrence. `Ay, guilty enough, doubtless,' responded Selden, `but as deeply dyed in guilt as he is, there is another still more guilty,—wretched man, what has become of your master?' `He escaped unhurt from your accursed mine, feebly muttered the wounded ruffian in reply. `And has fled?' asked the former, `Yes, fled, like a craven brute,' said the other, with an angry scowl, `fled with the few who were as lucky as himself, leaving me and the rest of the wounded, with our cries for assistance ringing in his ears, to die like dogs, alone here in the woods.— And they have died—some of their wounds, some by crawling into the river and drowning, and some by plunging their knives into their own bodies to put themselves out of misery. Yes, all gone, but me; and I'— `But perhaps your leader went off after a reinforcement, expecting soon to return with better means of serving you,' interrupted Selden, with the view of gathering from the other such information as would enable him to judge of the probability of Sherwood's return to renew the attack. `No, damn him!' exclaimed the wretch bitterly; `he supposed, as I did, that all of your band, as well as most of our own, had perished in the explosion. No! the infernal villain intended I should die,' he continued, with an expression rendered fairly diabolical by rage, combined with the bodily anguish he was enduring. `But he did not dream I should fall alive in your hands, else he had finished me on the spot to prevent it, the black souled devil! for he is well aware that I know enough of him, and his father before him, to make my revenge as ample as it will be sweet.' `What do you know of his father?' asked Captain Hendee, stepping forward with looks of eager curiosity and interest. `Enough,' replied the other—`enough of both, to my sorrow: for between them, they have worked my ruin and death.—In aiding the old man in his villainy, I damned my soul; and in abetting that of his son, I have lost my life, for I feel that I must go now soon, though I might have been saved.—Yes, and what have they done for me? what can they do now? Nothing! The old man has gone to his place; and Jake—perdition seize him!' `What do you mean?' sharply demanded the Captain: `Is John Sherwood dead?—Why, Jake told me before he turned devil to us, and not more than a week since neither, that his father was alive and'— `And what if he did,' interrupted Darrow, growing restless and impatient from the pain which was now evidently beginning to invade the citadel of life,—`what if he did? The old man made a will— too much in favor of your daughter here, or you, he suspects; and all was to be kept dark till he could bring certain things about.' `Man, man, you are deceiving me!' cried the other warmly. `Father, I believe he is speaking the truth,' interposed the daughter, to whose mind the late conduct of Sherwood, before inexplicable, was now explained. `Truth—truth! Alma Hendee,' resumed the wounded man, now breathing thick, and speaking with increasing difficulty;—`it is only the beginning of truths, that concerns you all, that—that I could —that I must and will tell, if—if soul and body will hold together long enough for me to expose'— `Expose what? what can you reveal?—go on! speak—speak!' exclaimed the old gentleman, impatiently breaking in on the other, in a tone and air of feverish excitement. Wait—wait,' resumed Darrow, grating his clenched teeth and writhing about in a fresh paroxism of anguish.—`I will—will tell all—but wait till this is over—O, that pain! Oh! God! that pain, that pain!' and the poor wretch gasped for breath and wildly threw about his arms in the insufferable pangs of his agony. `Captain Hendee,' he faintly, and in a softened tone, resumed, after the desperate paroxism had subsided, `did you ever mistrust that John Sherwood played you foul in respect to your property, which you was blind enough to intrust to his management?' `Why—I thought strange,' replied the other, `and yet I could not detect—but was he dishonest then?' `Yes,' exclaimed Darrow; `in that final settlement he defrauded you out of more than half of what was honestly your own: and, as the main instance, you recollect a large landed law suit he brought in you behalf?' `I do,' said the Captain, `and finding he must fail in it, and subject me to ruinous costs, he compromised by paying a small sum, and withdrew the action, as I understood.' `Well, now, it is God's truth, Captain,' rejoined the former, `that instead of paying any thing, he received a large sum,—his adversary, and not he, finding he must fail.' `The faithless villain!' exclaimed the astonished Captain, `may the wrath—but I will not curse him, now he is gone.' `No, for you can revenge yourself more effectually,' said the other: `the man with whom this compromise was made is still alive; and, though it was agreed that the transaction should be kept a dead secret, there is no doubt he will swear to the amount he payed Sherwood, as he was not privy to the fraud on you!' `But how know you all this?' asked the Captain, some new doubt seeming to arise in his mind. `You will know directly,' replied Darrow—`that is, if—if I tell you the rest'—he continued, pausing and hesitating, as if irresolute whether to proceed; but at length seeming to make up his mind, he resumed, `Captain Hendee, you once had a darling son, who was lost?' `I did, I did,' responded the other with visible emotion. `And you have heard,' continued the former, `that he was last seen with a young man in John Sherwood's employ—did you ever see that young man?' `No,' said the Captain, `nor do I know what became of him, or whether he is now living.' `He is still living, but will not be long,' said Darrow: `you see him in the miserable, shattered and dying creature lying before you, Captain Hendee.' `You! you!' wildly and fiercely exclaimed the old man, `but what f my son? wretch! did you murder the boy?' he added, raising his voice almost to a frantic scream, as the suspicion flashed over his anticipating thoughts. `No, I was spared that,' answered the other, `though my instigator, who was no other than that same John Sherwood, expected it of me, I think. No, I came across an Indian, who, for a bottle of rum, was willing to take the boy where his friends should never hear of him again.' `And you agreed with the hell-hound to do it, did you, monster!' again fiercely demanded the Captain. `Yes, I did that—I own it! I own it! aye, I confess it!' exclaimed Darrow, eagerly repeating the words, as if he had brought himself to this act of penitence by some mighty effort. `There!' he added, wildly and menancingly brandishing his fist at some imaginary presence, as he began to draw up his limbs and glare deliriously around him under another and fearful attack of his pains, `there! I have confessed it, you black fiend!' and with a terrible yell of seeming exultation and defiance, he fell back convulsed from head to foot; and for many moments, he appeared to be wrestling terribly with the angel of death. At length, however, he became calm, and again opened his eyes upon the horror-stricken, but intensely interested company. `I can't live through another like that—so let me speak while I can—you would know more of your son?' faintly said the reviving wretch, turning his glazed and blood-shot eye languidly upon the Captain. `Yes, yes,' replied the other in a softened and imploring tone; `yes, if you have strength to go on, tell me, if you know, for God's sake tell me, whether there is any hope for a bereaved and sorrow-stricken old man?—Did you ever hear of the boy— do you think he is still living?' `If that boy lived to grow up,' said Darrow, in reply,—if he be still among the living, Captain Hendee, I believe he is now standing by your side.' Wholly unprepared for a developement so unexpected and improbable, the company stood silently gazing at each other a moment with looks of mingled doubt and astonishment; when Selden, who was obviously the one alluded to by the confessant, and who had appeared thoughtful and abstracted during the latter part of the conversation, now turned to the other, and, with the air of one trying to recall some indistinct image of other days, observed, `I have some strange dim recollections—but what circumstances can you name to warrant the belief you have just expressed?' `Why, if I am right,' answered Darrow, `as I still think I am, you must have had, for many years, if you have not now, the proof on your own person! For before I parted from the boy, I pricked two crossed arrows, with lasting ink, into his skin, near the elbow.' A flash of joyous intelligence instantly broke over the beaming countenance of the young officer, and, as quick as thought, his arm was bared and held exultingly aloft, disclosing the still visibly impicted arrows to the astonished and delighted group around him. For one full minute not a word was uttered, and the mute eloquence of the speaking countenance alone told the springing emotions of those most interested in this unexpected but happy denouement. `My son!' at length convulsively burst from the trembling lips of the overpowered father: `God bless—bless—bless'—and his voice died away in whimpering murmers, as father, son and daughter rushed into one long, sobbing embrace. Aroused in a short time from this absorbing scene of gushing affections, by a noise from the wounded man, the company turned toward him. A change was passing over his face, and with the low muttered words, `REVENGED—REVENGED ON THE DESTROYERS OF MY SOUL AND BODY, AT LAST!' he gave one long, quivering gasp and expired. On the proposal of Selden, for such, for covenience, we will for the present continue to call him, the company now left the spot, and proceeded to an open and unincumbered space by the road side, where the whole band were soon assembled preparatory to a final removal from the scene of action. At that instant a band of twenty armed horsemen burst suddenly from the woods, and came pouring, in gallant array, along the road from the south towards the spot. From their equipments and general appearance, they were instantly discovered to be a detachment of mounted riflemen from the Continental army, headed by a field officer of considerable rank. `You are the day after the Fair, my hearties, gaily remarked Captain Hendee, whose over mastering feelings at the recent joyful discovery, had now settled down into a fine flow of spirits. `But I am glad they have come, for I want the whole world to know how proud I feel of my new found son.' `Aye, but when they hear,' replied the young officer in the same spirit, `that we owe this victory, and with it our lives, solely to the old veteran's plan of blowing up the enemy by wholesale, ten to one, they don't say, that the son has far the most reason to pride himself in the happy discovery. Seriously, however, the arrival of these men, at this moment, is most opportune, as some of them, doubtless, will give up their horses to convey you, the females and children from the place. But what ails our merry friend Jones, yonder?' he added, pointing to the scout, who stood in the foreground, eagerly and with mouth agape, looking at the advancing 24 cavalcade, and holding his cap in his hand, as if about to hurl it into the air, in some joyous outbreak. `He is about to welcome them with a few cheers, I suspect,' replied the captain. `And hang me, if I don't join him; for if I don't give vent to my feelings in some way, I believe my old broken shell of a heart will burst for very joy, like some old rusty howitzer, charged to the muzzle with gunpowder.' `No, no, father,' rejoined the other good humoredly,' `joy rarely proves as explosive as that, I imagine. But I must forward to attend to this reception myself,—Jones,' he continued, advancing to the front, `let us ascertain their object, and a little more exactly who they are, before we make up our mouths for much of a hurra on the occasion.' `Well that's jest what I'm at, Captain,' said the scout; `and I calkerlate I have about two thirds found out both them particulars, already: for, if twenty-four hours ago, I had seen a chap riding towards me, with the make, and bearing of that officer, who sits so splendid in his saddle younder, I would have sworn, with a quarter of this bothering, that it was—and, by the living Lazarus! I'll swear it is now—so here's hurra for the unshot Colonel! hurra! hurra!' he added, throwing his cap thirty feet in the air, and leaping, in the extacy of his joyous emotions, a yard from the earth at each of his stentorian shouts; in the last of which he was heartily joined by the whole band of his delighted comrades, as their beloved commander, the heroic Warrington, whom they had mourned as slain, now came dashing up to the spot, bowing low in token of acknowledgement of this flattering mark of their esteem. `Had you dropped down from the clouds before our eyes, Colonel Warrington,' said Selden, after the noise and bustle of this enthusiastic reception had a little subsided, `your presence could have scarcely more surprised us.' `Indeed!' `Yes, you was reported to have fallen in the last moments of the battle.' `I must then have been mistaken, I think, for Colonel Francis.' `Has that noble fellow then indeed been added to the honored catalogue of martyrs in our glorious cause?' `I grieve to say it.—He fell covered with wounds, bravely fighting at the head of his regiment.' `But you, and your men?'— `We yet mostly live to give Burgoyne a thrashing. But here, overpowered with numbers, by my own orders, we broke, scattered and fled, to meet again at Manchester. Reaching Rutland last night, and guessing at your course, and at your danger, I collected this small force, and hastened to the rescue. And now, Captain, for your report, which, with these evidences of a conflict before me, I should dread to hear, but for the merry looks of the men, and the sunny faces of my fair friends whom I notice youder in the rear.' `All in good time, my dear Colonel; but come, first go along with me,' said Selden with a significant and slightly mischievous smile, as he took the arm of his superior, and urged him forward to the spot where the interesting group to which he had just alluded still stood, in the agitation of their joyful surprise, with sparkling eyes and happy and fluttering hearts, eagerly waiting to greet him. But over the touching and tender scene that followed, marked as it was by the reuniting of long estranged hearts, like the rushing together of kindred waters, the surprising announcement of Selden's recently discovered relationship, and the mad pranks of the excited old veteran, now clamouring for the curses of Warrington on his own head, for his blindness and folly, and now eagerly bestowing the hand of his daughter, as a compensation and reward, with many a sob-broken ejaculation for blessings on the happy couple—over all this will we drop the curtain, not caring to trust the pen to vie with the reader's outstripping fancy in filling up the picture. Before another hour had elapsed the whole were mounted and in motion, on their unmolested way to the older settlements in the southern part of the Grants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION. The rolling seasons had nearly completed their annual round since the stirriug incidents, which we last narrated, transpired, and nature was again enrobing herself in the leafy glories of summer. The great struggle on the northern frontiers was over. The battle of Bennington had been fought and won, immortalizing the name of the Roman Stark, and covering with deathless laurels the brave Green Mountain Boys. The whole of that proud army, indeed, that swept, the last season, so vauntingly along these desolated shores, had felt the vengeful arm of young Freedom, and withered at the touch. The inhabitants on the borders of Champlain, who had fled before the tempest of war, had mostly returned, and were now in possession of their unmolested homes. The seat of their country's strife was removed to a distance. And the husbandman was again following his plow in the field; the peaceful sounds of the axeman were heard in the woods, and the hunter once more roamed his deer-trod hills unsuspicious of hostile ambush. At the pleasant, and no longer desolate cottage of Captain Hendee, a company, evidently much larger than the usual family circle, were assembled.—The old veteran, as was formerly his wont, was sitting in his easy chair before one of the open windows of the parlor, solacing himself with his old companion, the pipe. The other window was occupied by a fine looking military person, now in the full bloom of vigourous manhood, richly dressed in the lacetrimed uniform, and the surmounted badges of a field officer in the continental army; while by his side sat a peerless girl, whose simple, but rich and tasteful array of spotless white, surmounted by the emblematic rose of the same color, instead of the dumb, unspeaking jewel, told of bridal preparation. They were gazing out upon the glittering expanse of the breeze ruffled waters of the Lake, and the gratified eye of the officer was resting on the bright folds of his country's flag, which was again proudly waving in the distance over the walls of the opposite fortress; while the delicately blended fondness and respect, that marked the blissful look of each, and the tender pathos of their low intermingling voices, as they exchanged the occasional remark, betokened the presence of mutual confidence and love. There was another maiden in the room, *24 scarcely less beautiful than the one just mentioned, but though arrayed like her fair companion, in the bridal garb, yet she sat unmated and alone, now listlessly running over the leaves of a little volume in her hand, and now anxiously and impatiently glancing through the window along the road to the south, as if expecting the appearance of some one from that quarter. The only other person at present in this apartment, with whom the reader has been made acquainted, was a modest, staid looking female, who, though comely, and not greatly faded, had yet evidently out-lived, by many years, the freshness and bloom of beauty's most favored period, She was sitting quietly in a corner, partly screened from the rest of the company by a door that swung inward. She, also, had been companionless, and had not, like the restless fair one last described, appeared to expect to be otherwise. But at this moment a singularly tall, woodsman-looking fellow came stooping through the door-way from the adjoining room, where part of the company still remained; when after throwing a half sheepish, half mischievous look around him, apparently to see if his movement was particularly noticed, he sidled around the swinging door, with a sort of hesitating, stealthy, air, and sunk by degrees into a chair beside the demure looking damsel of whom we were speaking. `Well, now, if this ain't curious fix!' were his first words—`I vow to Never-come-Jack—a sort of Saturday in the afternoon-chap that we used to swear by in the army—if it ain't too bad! Don't you think so, now, honestly, Miss Ruth?' `What is it that you complain of as so bad, Mr. Jones?' replied the girl, with a good natured and encouraging smile, which seemed instantly to re-assure her somewhat flustered companion, as he replied. `What do I complain of?—Why, to be invited, as I was, by the Colonel and Alma there, to be here at 2 o'clock to see three weddings; when now it is well along towards night, and one bridegroom don't get on according to agreement, and no parson come to fix them that are here and ready for it. Now I like to see folks put out of their misery in some kind of season; and so do the rest of them, I've a notion:—only jest look at the old Captain, yonder!— He is getting out of sorts at the delay rather rapid, a body would guess, by the manner he is puffing away at his old comforter there. And there is the Scotch bird, too,—may I miss my next aim on Old Trusty, if I don't believe she'll fly away, if Major Selden, as he has now got to be—Major Hendee, I spose, you'll call him here—don't come soon.' `Jessy does, indeed, appear rather uneasy,' observed the other, `and I really wonder Edward don't come, myself: He sent us word, that he expected to get the Sherwood property all settled so as to start from Albany yesterday morning. But you said three weddings, did'nt you?' `Three, did I say, Ruth?' asked Pete with waggish gravity—`Well, two then—that is, if there ain't raaly any chance to be another, no way.' `Why what other could there be?' said Ruth quite innocently. `Well, now, I can't exactly say, but I was thinking it was rather a pity there shouldn't be another match worked up here somehow?' replied the scout, with a look at the other so significant, that it brought the blood into her cheeks. `You hold to saving time and expense don't you?' `Why, it is well enough to think of that in some cases, perhaps,' muttered the doubtful and confused girl,' `Then suppose when the priest comes,' said the other with a roguish squint at her glowing cheeks and down cast looks, `suppose you jest stand up with—with—with old Captain Hendee, to be noosed the same time his children are?' `O, nonsense! Mr. Jones,' replied the girl greatly relieved, and yet evidently disappointed at this turn in the scout's remarks, which she supposed were to terminate in proposing one much nearer home—`Captain Hendee! why he is old enough to be my father!—Besides he would not have me.' `Yes he would.' `No he wouldn't.' `Well, if he should flummux at such a chance, I know of a chap—and not too old neither—who'll agree to take his place.' `Really, Mr. Jones, I think you must be trying to trifle with me?' `Mayhap you've mistaken, now,' said Jones with the air of one about to make some hazardous push, but looking keenly about for some chance to secure his retreat. `Then how am I to consider what you say?' asked the other seriously. `Why—why'—said Pete, hesitating, but finding himself at a point where he must back out entirely, or proceed directly with his object, he added, with a sort of desperate resolution,—`Yes, I will—so here goes for dead ruin—you may consider it, Ruth, as good and earnest an offer as ever a man stuck an axe in a tree.' `Why, surely Mr. Jones!—this is so sudden—so unexpected, that you cannot expect me now, as you have never before spoken to me on the subject'— `No, but I've looked at you on the subject, Ruth; —and that an't all, I have thought on the subject, and that too, ever since I left off sogering, after we had used up that old trooper, Burgoyne, last fall. But I didn't know how to get at the bothering business. And now I have got at it, I want to do it all up, while I've got the knack of it. Now all I've to say for myself, by way of recommend, is jest only this,—I have a farm, and can love like a two year old. And if you can go it on that, let us agree on the spot, and go off with the rest.' `Impossible, Mr. Jones—that is now—if—if I had a little time for reflection—perhaps'— `Good! grand! glorious! I'll give you time, till the parson comes,—a good half hour, I'll warrant you,' exclaimed the woodsman, leaping up in his extacy, and, with a sudden bolt through the door, bounding off into the fields, and giving vent to his delighted feelings in his old chorus, `Trol, lol, lol, de larly!' At that moment a horseman rode hastily into the yard, leaped from his saddle, and, with a few light and joyous bounds, landed on the threshold. `My brother!' exclaimed Alma, rising and rushing to the door. `My son, God bless you!' said the Coptain, hobbling forward with extended hand. `But how came you to be lagging at such a juncture as this, you truant?' `O, Edward!' cried Jessy, bursting from an adjoining room, to which she had a few moments before retired, `O, Edward!' repeated the joyful but wayward girl, flying to the open arms of her betrothed, now dashing her hands about her to clear her way among the advancing group, and now shaking her slender finger aloft in affected menace as she went: `now, if I don't punish you for this, sir! Back! back all of you, till I deal with the villain for his conduct.' `Fairly a prisoner, sir; you may as well surrender, Major,' gaily observed Warrington to the laughing young officer, now enclosed on every side by beseiging friends. `Aye, aye, Colonel,' blithely replied the latter; `but I shall be upon my parol in a moment, I think; when I will pay my respects—I have a glad secret for your ear, Warrington.' `A secret! a secret to be kept from us, at this hour!' exclaimed both of the girls at once, summoning a storm of affected indignation to their pretty brows. `Ah! you little tyrranizers!' said the Major, jocosely, `you are wise to make the most of your power now; for your reign is short. I saw the parson falling into the road behind me, about a mile back.' The last intimation seemed to produce an instant effect on the young officer's fair assailants. And releasing him at once, they fled, in maidenly dismay, to their private apartment to compose and prepare themselves for the happy, though half dreaded crisis. `Now, my son, tell us, in a word, what success you have met with at Albany,' said Captain Hendee, turning to his son as the girls disappeared. `Very fair:—the business is all definitely settled at last.' `Right glad to hear that; but first, I am curious to know with what kind of face that black-hearted imp of mischief, Jake Sherwood, met you, after all that has happened?' `It was not till after many fruitless efforts, and a long negociation, carried on with him by a go-between of his own kidney, that he could be induced to come from his lurking places to face me at all. And when he did, it was with the same fawning and cringing, the same dissembling and falsehood, that has marked his whole career.' `And what kind of a treaty did you at length conclude with the arch villain?' `Better than he had any reason to expect from those who had both the right and the power on their side: for, after taking from the estate that part which Jake had counted as his own by Uncle's will, when I was considered as disposed of, and which of course became mine, on establisbing my identity as your son,—and after deducting also the legacies, which old Sherwood's conscience wrung from him in favor of you and Alma, together with the sums, which the indefatigable Vanderpool had found evidence of having been embezzled by the old man out of your property,—even after counting your legacies as so much restitution—after deducting all these, there would have been a mere pittance in equity, and nothing, probably, in law, left for the miscreant. And as he had been apprised of this by Vanderpool, whom he could neither intimidate nor corrupt, he chose to throw himself on my mercy, rather than contend with us in law.' `Well, as skillfully as this web of iniquity was woven, it is all unravelled, then, at last. But what did you finally allow him?' `A thousand pounds; for while I despised, I could not but pity the abject wretch. He signed acquittances, received his portion, in money and drafts, and the same day, as I accidentally learned, started off to join his tory brethren at the south.' The conversation was here interrupted by the arrival of the parson, who had scarcely been ushered into the house, before yet another guest was announced. This was the amazon widow, who now rode into the yard, attended by Neshobee, each having a brace of her hardy urchins, disposed of behind and before, on the cruppers and necks of the Captain's thus trebly burdened horses, which had been kindly sent for that purpose early in the morning. `Not at the eleventh hour after all,' said the woman, as with stately tread she came sweeping into the room, and gave her hand successively to each of the assembled guests, who rose, and with looks of mingled cordiality and respect, advanced to meet her. `Well, I am gratified to find I am not too late to witness the ceremony, though another motive mainly prompted my coming.' `Another motive?' said the Captain, `what might that be?' `Gratitude,' rejoined the widow feelingly—`to offer, in person, the thanks and blessings of the widow and fatherless to these brave and generous young officers, for their undeserved gift of fifty pounds.' `Not undeserved, especially from us, permit me to say, Mrs. Story,' replied Major Hendee. `And our only fear was, that it would not even requite you for the losses you sustained on our account on that fearful night, which none of us can ever forget.' `Not requite me? O, more—doubly so,' replied the woman, mastering her grateful emotions, and resuming her naturally free and easy manner: `Why, gentlemen, if you would but visit us there now, you would see a new house worth two of the old one, flourishing crops, and a well provisioned and happy family—and all from your bounty.' `Our pittance, if you please,' observed the Colonel, `and that too, under the management of one, who, I must say, of all women'— `Has the least patience with a flatterer, Colonel,' interrupted the widow with good natured bluntness, jumping up and going to the window, as something seemed suddenly to occur to her mind. `Now, I should like to know, if you gentlemen can tell me,' she resumed, after gazing out on the lake a moment, `I should like to know the meaning of the great stir I noticed over at the fort, as I came down the road: one would think they were preparing for a battle.' `We heard a firing in the direction of Ticonderoga an hour or two ago, which we could not account for, but have noticed nothing unusual over here, I believe,' said Captain Hendee, looking enquiringly at the two officers. `Ah! your promised secret, Major?' cried Warrington, perceiving a knowing and mysterious smile upon the countenance of the other. `You shall have it now—the rest of the company will know it soon,' replied the Major, approaching his superior and whispering in his ear. `God bless you for the news!' exclaimed the Colonel, with a look of joyful surprise. `But where did you meet him?' `At Bennington, where he arrived but three days ago amidst the roar of guns and the shouts of a rejoicing people. I persuaded him to come on with me, as he did, to Skenesboro'; when he took the 25 water, while I came by land, having first despatched a runner to notify the garrisons at the two posts of his approach.' `Heaven be praised!' rejoined Warrington, `and let the Green Mountains rejoice!' `They will, soon; for yonder he comes, by Jove!' exclaimed the Major, eagerly pointing out upon the lake. At that instant the house shook and trembled to the reverberating roar of a twenty-four pounder, belching forth a cloud of fire and smoke from the grey walls of the opposite fortress. The surprised and startled company instantly rushed into the yard. A light sail boat had just made her appearace on the lake from the south, and, with bellying canvass, was now scudding rapidly before the freshening breeze, with her course evidently set for the fort. As she neared, a tall, erect, military figure appeared conspicuously standing on the forecastle, with folded arms, gazing steadily forward towards the works, around whose ramparts were seen the long rows of the expectant officers and soldiers of the garrison; while, at momentary intervals, came the welcoming peal of the deep mouthed gun. At length the sails of the vessel were furled, and she swept round and lay to, directly abreast of the fort; which, the next instant, was suddenly enveloped in a springing cloud of smoke, while the tall forest around nodded to the united roar of a dozen cannon, among the broken echoes of which, as they rolled from shore to shore and died away among the far responding mountains, was heard the noisy salute of drums, and the reiterated cheers of the soldiery, once more making the welkin ring with the name of `Ethan Allen!' After a brief interval of silence, the same little craft was seen, with hoisted sails, emerging from the lifting clouds of smoke, and making her way directly across the lake towards the cottage. And in ten minutes more the hero of the Green Mountains, unexpectedly returned from a long and painful captivity, was received, and ushered into the house amidst the warm and unfeigned congratulations of the rejoicing party. `Well, Colonel Allen,' said Captain Hendee, scanning the thin and worn person of the other, as they all became seated in the room, `they have rather worsted you in your captivity, I perceive: you are now hardly the staunch and iron bound fellow you was three years ago, when eight or ten armed hirelings came here to seize you as a York outlaw, but were fairly cowed out of the attempt till they supposed you asleep, and a little worse off than that too, perhaps.' `Aha! my old friend, do you remember that foolish scrape?' replied Allen. `No, no, Captain, not the man I was then,' he added, glancing over the huge raw bones of his shrunken frame with a melancholy smile; `no, the British could never forgive me for taking old Ti; so with characteristic magnanimity to a fallen foe, they took their revenge by battering, hewing, hacking and starving the oldbody, till there is scarcely enough left of it to furnish a habitable tenement for the soul, which remains as whole and sound as ever; for that, thank God, they could neither kill nor bribe.' `Bribe! bribe! did they really try to do that?' exclaimed the young officers, laughing at the thought of an attempt to buy up Ethan Allen. `To be sure, did the infernal fools!' said Allen, `and that more than once; though the last, and perhaps the best offer I ever had to induce me to damn myself, that is, to become one of them, was made me by a high dignitary of the crown, who, in behalf of his prince, as he said, offered me nearly half the lands in Vermont, if I would enter his service against my countrymen!—the Christless knave! It was well for him that I was handcuffed, at the time.' `And what answer did you give him?' asked Warrington, curiously. `Answer?' replied Allen, smoothing his dark brows, which had become fierce and stormy at the remembered insult, `what answer? why, I told the royal ape to go and tell his master, that he reminded me, in his offer to give me lands in America, of a certain other prince, mentioned in scripture, who took the Savior up into a high mountain, and showing him all the kingdoms of the world, offered to give him the whole of them, if he would fall down and worship him,—when the fact was, the poor devil had not a single foot of land on earth to give!' The subject was here dropped by common consent; when, after a brief pause, Major Hendee turned a significant look upon his father, who seemed readily to understand what was now expected of him, and he accordingly observed,— `I suppose you have been apprised, Colonel Allen, of the happy occasion, upon which, after all our troubles, we have been permitted to assemble?' `I have, sir,' gallantly answered the other, `and I felt, that my peculiar notions, relative to the certainty of the earthly rewards of bravery and virtue, were strikingly confirmed, when I learned, that my two friends here were about to draw such rich prizes in the lottery of life.' `Ah! Colonel Allen,' exclaimed Jessy archly, `you, too, caught playing the flatterer? I had thought well enough of you to believe you an exception to the generality of men, in that respect. But I'll expose you, my brave Colonel!—What did you say and predict, at the time you captured Ticonderoga, respecting the intimacy which you were then accidentally led to suspect existed between your then Lieutenant Selden and Colonel Reed's daughter?' `Why, the deuce is to pay!' cried Allen, taken rather aback by his fair antagonist—`there has been treason here, somewhere. I recollect something about my misgivings in the matter. But I am not a going to be tricked out of my compliment, at all events: for, if the daughter of a British Colonel has the independence to marry a Yankee rebel, she must be, to him, at least, a prize richly worth the winning.' `She is not married yet,' observed Captain Hendee, with well assumed seriousness: `for before that is suffered to take place, I, who stand as a sort of sponsor for the girl, must be heard in the business: and to this end, I beg leave to read a little from my letter of instructions from her father; which I have never before made known,' he added, producing a letter, from which he proceeded to read to his surprised and wondering auditors the following extract: “Wi' regard to that wayward bairn o' mine, an' that Mr. Nabody, her rebel lover, as I became satisfied he was, it is out o' the question I should be consentin' to a match o' sic a sort. Na, she must be cured, an' in some sic way as I named to you. An' that being done, then her old lover, Major Skene, will come in for an easy conquest. But in 25* your moves to this object, let me again caution you to beware how you forbid this intimacy; for ever since mother Eve's dido wi' the apple, the moment you forbid, the Diel taks the woman.' `Father, how is this, and at this late hour?' exclaimed the astonished son, glancing from the former to the no less surprised girl at his side, who also began to open her lips in remonstrance, when, detecting a lurking smile on the old gentleman's countenance, she stopped short. `Perhaps we may as well read a passage from another letter of a more rececent date,' said the Captain, opening another paper, from which, after slyly enjoying the perplexity of the party interested, a moment, he read,— “So, you sly old Yankee, you an' Jessy hae contrived to check-mate me at last! This comes o' leaving a daughter in a land o' rebellion: nathless I canna but say, I regret that circumstances will not permit me to be present to take my stoup on the merry occasion, which you say, wi' my consent, is to tak place early the coming summer: weel, you may tell the younker, wi'out hinting my good opinion o' him as aboon written, that, upon the whole, I will own him as a son-in-law, provided he will tak the crap o' wild oats which the chick, frae sa plentifu' a sowing, must now hae ready for the reaping, as a portion o' the wife's dowry.” `Gad! I begin to like the humerous old fellow,' said Allen; `and that stoup which he regrets he cannot take with us, I will drink to his health as an extra bumper after the ceremony. Though before that takes place, I would ask if there are no more cases which might be settled at this time?' `We know of none,' replied the Captain and his son, to whom the last part of the speaker's remarks had been addressed in an undertone. `I don't know about that,' rejoined the former, `I have been looking about me a little, and it strikes me that there are materials enough, at least. If you will make me master of the ceremonies, with powers to draw out the parties?'— `Certainly, certainly, Colonel,' replied the others, laughing, but shaking their heads dubiously at the well understood suggestion. `No faith, eh? Well, there is nothing like trying,' rejoined Allen. `Jones,' he continued, now turning round to the scout, who had resumed his seat by the side of Ruth, `Jones, you have been a brave fellow—how is it that you are not be rewarded, at this time, as well as the rest?' `Well, I've jest been thinking, Colonel, replied Jones, screwing up his phiz, now queerly streaked with blushes, `that it was rather a hard case, considering, that I shouldn't have any share in the loaves and fishes. But the fact is, that the fish that I've had in my eye,' he added, casting a sheepish glance at Ruth, `won't quite say, whether I'm to be in luck to day, or not.' `Aha! just as I thought. But she shall say,' cried Allen, advancing a step towards the confused and blushing maiden, on whom all eyes were now turned in surprise, at this development of a courtship so little expected; `she shall give you an answer, at least, or, by the wrath of Cupid! she shall be punished for her cruelty by running a kissing gauntlet through the company. And I'll have the first one,' he added, still further advancing, as if to suit the action to the word. `It is so rediculous!' stammered the shrinking Ruth. `Perhaps you would rather say yes to my worthy friend, here?' said the former, his lip slightly curling with a sportive smile. `I should—that is, I—I should,' replied the girl, dropping her head in confusion. `Do you see that?' exultingly said Allen—`I have succeeded in spite of your faithlessness: nor do I believe my triumphs need end even here.' `Ah! I will knock under, Colonel,' observed the Captain, laughing. `Ay, ay,' responded the Major, gaily, `we must now acknowledge your prowess in the court of Cupid, as well as in the camp of Mars. But be not over ambitious, lest your zeal be dampened by a failure. Where will you find materials for another triumph?' `Here,' answered the other, pointing to Neshobee and Zilpah, who, for reasons best understood by themselves, had also paired off in a corner together. `I have been reading eyes, which are about the only book I ever read where we are sure of the truth; and if those who control these persons should have no objections'— `Never mind that, Colonel, if you have faith for the trial,' exclaimed the old Captain, entering into the full spirit of the game. `Upon my word, Colonel Allen, I think you a most incorrigible meddler; but you may proceed, for aught I care,' said Miss Reed, pouting most beautifully. `Ah, don't laugh, ye wise ones till you see,' said the jovial matchmaker, confidently. `Well, Miss Zilpah,' he continued, familiarly addressing the half blood, `you see which way your young mistress is about to travel—now, as you intend to follow her fortunes, don't you think it would be more pleasant and suitable for you to have some such brave and trusty companion on the road as Neshobee here would make you?' `Ki!' exclaimed the girl, with a blush which brought her cheek to a fellow redness with that of the young Indian by her side. `He! you queer man! But Neshobee, he no hab me.' `Good!' cried the former, `there is a challenge for you, my red friend. She says you wont marry her!' `Umph!' uttered the still grave, though evidently delighted native, `me never know Zilpah tell lie before.' `There! you unbelievers,' exclaimed Allen, looking round triumphantly upon the company, `see what a man can do. Now, parson, do your duty.' Reader, our story is told, and, with a word upon the subsequent career of those in whose destinies we trust we have been able in some degree to interest you, we will bid you adieu: Of that singular, bold, rough, versatile, yet honest and strong minded man, Ethan Allen, little more need be said. The remainder of his public life was devoted to the accomplishment of that object, for which he had so fearlessly contended before the revolution, the independence of his state. And her history sufficiently attests to the importance of his services. The gallant young officers, after their twice extended furloughs had expired, leaving their lovely and loving wives at the cottage of Captain Hendee, to cheer and soothe the old veteran in his declining years, and, in due time, to render his second childhood any thing but companionless, returned to their posts in the army, in which, honored and distinguished, they remained, till they had witnessed the achievement of their country's independence; when they retired to their homes in the Green Mountains, to receive from their fellow citizens those substantial memorials of their esteem which may still be found recorded among some of the early acts of the Legislature of Vermont, granting valuable tracts of land to certain individuals for important public services. Pete Jones and his staid spouse immediately repaired to their little opening in the woods, where, having renewed his acquaintance with his rusty axe, he caused the forest to melt away before his powerful arm, till his labors were rewarded by one of the best farms on the borders of the lake; while his wife became one of the most notable of housewives, having never had cause to regret her abrupt connection with the eccentric, though amiable woodsman, as may be inferred from the opinions she was often heard to express in favor of long men and short courtships. Widow Story remained on her farm, cultivating and enlarging it with her own hands for many years; when, her oldest son having at length been enabled to butt his mother, to use a chopper's phrase, that is, to get off his cut first, in a trial of skill on the same log, she concluded to betake herself to household duties, giving up her farm work to her sturdy little band of foresters, who, in the process of time, let in the sun on extensive tracts of some of the finest lands on Otter Creek. Neshobee and his yellow rib continued to reside on the farm of Captain Hendee, in a log hut built expressly for them, till the old gentleman's death; when they removed to the woody shores of the Horican, where they spent their days in a ceaseless warfare upon the beautiful trout of the lake, and the dear; bear and other wild animals of its surrounding shores. And, lastly, the miscreant Sherwood, who, through the inscrutable ways of Providence, was permitted to live, Cain like, to old age, found his way, at the close of the revolution, to the common refuge of American tories in Canada, where he finished his days in poverty and disgrace, always obtaining credit by flattery and falsehood, always abusing it by fraud and treachery, and living, indeed, abhorred by men and seemingly accursed of God. THE END.</field>
