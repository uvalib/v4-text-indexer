      <field name="fulltext">THE CORONAL. A COLLECTION OF MISCELLANEOUS PIECES, WRITTEN AT VARIOUS TIMES. BY MRS. CHILD LINES, SUGGESTED BY VANDERLYN'S FINE PICTURE OF CAIUS MARIUS AMONG THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE. Pillars are fallen at thy feet, Fanes quiver in the air, A prostrate city is thy seat, And thou alone art there. No change comes o'er thy noble brow, Though ruin is around thee; Thine eye-beam burns as proudly now, As when the laurel crown'd thee. It cannot bend thy lofty soul, Though friends and fame depart; The car of fate may o'er thee roll, Nor crush thy Roman heart. And genius hath electric power, Which earth can never tame; Bright suns may scorch, and dark clouds lower— Its flash is still the same! The dreams we loved in early life, May melt like mist away; High thoughts may seem, 'mid passion's strife, Like Carthage in decay. And proud hopes in the human heart May be to ruin hurl'd, Like mould'ring monuments of art Heap'd on a sleeping world. Yet there is something will not die, Where life hath once been fair; Some towering thoughts still rear on high, Some Roman lingers there!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1A THE LONE INDIAN. “A white man, gazing on the scene, Would say a lovely spot was here, And praise the lawns so fresh and green, Between the hills so sheer. I like it not—I would the plain Lay in its tall old groves again.” Bryant. Powontonamo was the son of a mighty chief. He looked on his tribe with such a fiery glance, that they called him the Eagle of the Mohawks. His eye never blinked in the sunbeam; and he leaped along the chase like the untiring waves of Niagara. Even when a little boy, his tiny arrow would hit the frisking squirrel in the ear, and bring down the humming bird on her rapid wing. He was his father's pride and joy. He loved to toss him high in his sinewy arms, and shout, “Look, Eagle-eye, look! and see the big hunting-grounds of the Mohawks! Powontonamo will be their chief. The winds will tell his brave deeds. When men speak of him, they will not speak loud; but as if the Great Spirit had breathed in thunder.” The prophecy was fulfilled. When Powontonamo became a man, the fame of his beauty and courage reached the tribes of Illinois; and even the distant Osage showed his white teeth with delight, when he heard the wild deeds of the Mohawk Eagle. Yet was his spirit frank, chivalrous, and kind. When the white men came to buy land, he met them with an open palm, and spread his buffalo for the traveller. The old chiefs loved the bold youth, and offered their daughters in marriage. The eyes of the young Indian girls sparkled when he looked on them. But he treated them all with the stern indifference of a warrior, until he saw Soonseetah raise her long dark eye-lash. Then his heart melted beneath the beaming glance of beauty. Soonseetah was the fairest of the Oneidas. The young men of her tribe called her the Sunny-eye. She was smaller than her nation usually are; and her slight, graceful figure was so elastic in its motions, that the tall grass would rise up and shake off 1B its dew drops, after her pretty moccasins had pressed it. Many a famous chief had sought her love; but when they brought the choicest furs, she would smile disdainfully, and say, “Soonseetah's foot is warm. Has not her father an arrow?” When they offered her food, according to the Indian custom, her answer was, “Soonseetah has not seen all the warriors. She will eat with the bravest.” The hunters told the young Eagle, that Sunny-eye of Oneida was beautiful as the bright birds in the hunting-land beyond the sky; but that her heart was proud, and she said the great chiefs were not good enough to dress venison for her. When Powontonamo listened to these accounts, his lip would curl slightly, as he threw back his fur-edged mantle, and placed his firm, springy foot forward, so that the beads and shells of his rich moccasin might be seen to vibrate at every sound of his tremendous war song. If there was vanity in the act, there was likewise becoming pride. Soonseetah heard of his haughty smile, and resolved in her own heart that no Oneida should sit beside her, till she had seen the chieftain of the Mohawks. Before many moons had passed away, he sought her father's wigwam, to carry delicate furs and shining shells to the young coquette of the wilderness. She did not raise her bright melting eye to his, when he came near her; but when he said, “Will the Sunny-eye look on the gift of a Mohawk? his barbed arrow is swift; his foot never turned from the foe;” the colour on her brown cheek was glowing as an autumnal twilight. Her voice was like the troubled note of the wren, as she answered, “The furs of Powontonamo are soft and warm to the foot of Soonseetah. She will weave the shells in the wampum belt of the Mohawk Eagle.” The exulting lover sat by her side, and offered her venison and parched corn. She raised her timid eye, as she tasted the food; and then the young Eagle knew that Sunny-eye would be his wife. There was feasting and dancing, and the marriage song rang merrily in Mohawk cabins, when the Oneida came among them. Powontonamo loved her as his own heart's blood. He delighted to bring her the fattest deers of the forest, and load her with the ribbons and beads of the English. The prophets of his people liked it not that the strangers grew so numerous in the land. They shook their heads mournfully, and said, “The moose and the beaver will not live within sound of the white man's gun. They will go beyond the lakes, and the Indians must follow their trail.” But the young chief laughed them to scorn. He said, “The land is very big. The mountain eagle could not fly over it in many days. Surely the wigwams of the English will never cover it.” Yet when he held his son in his arms, as his father had done before him, he sighed to hear the strokes of the axe levelling the old trees of his forests. Sometimes he looked sorrowfully on his baby boy, and thought he had perchance done him much wrong, when he smoked a pipe in the wigwam of the stranger. One day, he left his home before the grey mist of morning had gone from the hills, to seek food for his wife and child. The polar-star was bright in the heavens ere he returned; yet his hands were empty. The white man's gun had scared the beasts of the forest, and the arrow of the Indian was sharpened in vain. Powontonamo entered his wigwam with a cloudy brow. He did not look at Soonseetah; he did not speak to her boy; but, silent and sullen, he sat leaning on the head of his arrow. He wept not, for an Indian may not weep; but the muscles of his face betrayed the struggle within his soul. The Sunny-eye approached fearfully, and laid her little hand upon his brawny shoulder, as she asked, “Why is the Eagle's eye on the earth? What has Soonseetah done, that her child dare not look in the face of his father?” Slowly the warrior turned his gaze upon her. The expression of sadness deepened, as he answered, “The Eagle has taken a snake to his nest: how can his young sleep in it?” The Indian boy, all unconscious of the forebodings which stirred his father's spirit, moved to his side, and peeped up in his face with a mingled expression of love and fear. The heart of the generous savage was full, even to bursting. His hand trembled, as he placed it on the sleek black hair of his only son. “The Great Spirit bless thee! the Great Spirit bless thee, and give thee back the hunting ground of the Mohawk!” he exclaimed. Then folding him, for an instant, in an almost crushing embrace, he gave him to his mother, and darted from the wigwam. Two hours he remained in the open air; but the clear breath of heaven brought no relief to his noble and suffering soul. Wherever he looked abroad, the ravages of the civilized destroyer met his eye. Where were the trees, under which he had frolicked in infancy, sported in boyhood, and rested after the fatigues of battle? They formed the English boat, or lined the English dwelling. Where were the holy sacrifice-heaps of his people? The stones were taken to fence in the land, which the intruder dared to call his own. Where was his father's grave? The stranger's road passed over it, and his cattle trampled on the ground where the mighty Mohawk slumbered. Where were his once powerful tribe? Alas, in the white man's wars they had joined with the British, in the vain hope of recovering their lost privileges. Hundreds had gone to their last home; others had joined distant tribes; and some pitiful wretches, whom he scorned to call brethren, consented to live on the white man's bounty. These were corroding reflections; and well might fierce thoughts of vengeance pass through the mind of the deserted prince; but he was powerless now; and the English swarmed, like vultures around the dying. “It is the work of the Great Spirit,” said he. “The Englishman's God made the Indian's heart afraid; and now he is like a wounded buffalo, when hungry wolves are on his trail.” When Powontonamo returned to his hut, his countenance, though severe, was composed. He spoke to the Sunny-eye with more kindness than the savage generally addresses the wife of his youth; but his look told her that she must not ask the grief which had put a woman's heart within the breast of the far-famed Mohawk Eagle. The next day, when the young chieftain went out on a hunting expedition, he was accosted by a rough, square-built farmer. “Powow,” said he, “your squaw has been stripping a dozen of my trees, and I don't like it over much.” It was a moment when the Indian could ill brook a white man's insolence. “Listen, Buffalo-head!” shouted he; and as he spoke he seized the shaggy pate of the unconscious offender, and eyed him with the concentrated venom of an ambushed rattlesnake,—“Listen to the chief of the Mohawks! These broad lands are all his own. When the white man first left his cursed foot-print in the forest, the Great Bear looked down upon the big tribes of Iroquois and Abnaquis. The wigwams of the noble Delawares were thick, where the soft winds dwell. The rising sun glanced on the fierce Pequods; and the Illinois, the Miamies, and warlike tribes like the hairs of your head, marked his going down. Had the red man struck you then, your tribes would have been as dry grass to the lightning! Go—shall the Sunny-eye of Oneida ask the pale face for a basket?” He breathed out a quick, convulsive laugh, and his white teeth showed through his parted lips, as he shook the farmer from him, with the strength and fury of a raging panther. After that, his path was unmolested, for no one dared to awaken his wrath; but a smile never again visited the dark countenance of the degraded chief. The wild beasts had fled so far from the settlements, that he would hunt days and days without success. Soonseetah sometimes begged him to join the remnant of the Oneidas, and persuade them to go far off, toward the setting sun. Powontonamo replied, “This is the burial place of my fathers;” and the Sunny-eye dared say no more. At last, their boy sickened and died, of a fever he had taken among the English. They buried him beneath a spreading oak, on the banks of the Mohawk, and heaped stones upon his grave, without a tear. “He must lie near the water,” said the desolate chief, “else the white man's horses will tread on him.” The young mother did not weep; but her heart had received its death-wound. The fever seized her, and she grew paler and weaker every day. One morning, Powontonamo returned with some delicate food he had been seeking for her. “Will Soonseetah eat?” said he. He spoke in a tone of subdued tenderness; but she answered not. The foot which was wont to bound forward to meet him, lay motionless and cold. He raised the blanket which partly concealed her face, and saw that the Sunny-eye was closed in death. One hand was pressed hard against her heart, as if her last moments had been painful. The other grasped the beads which the young Eagle had given her in the happy days of courtship. One heart-rending shriek was rung from the bosom of the agonized savage. He tossed his arms wildly above his head, and threw himself beside the body of her he had loved as fondly, deeply, and passionately, as ever a white man loved. After the first burst of grief had subsided, he carefully untied the necklace from her full, beautiful bosom, crossed her hands over the sacred relic, and put back the shining black hair from her smooth forehead. For hours he watched the corpse in silence. Then he arose and carried it from the wigwam. He dug a grave by the side of his lost boy; laid the head of Soonseetah toward the rising sun; heaped the earth upon it, and covered it with stones, according to the custom of his people. Night was closing in, and still the bereaved Mohawk stood at the grave of Sunny-eye, as motionless as its cold inmate. A white man, as he passed, paused, and looked in pity on him. “Are you sick?” asked he. “Yes; me sick. Me very sick here,” answered Powontonamo, laying his hand upon his swelling heart. “Will you go home?” “Home!” exclaimed the heart broken chief, in tones so thrilling, that the white man started. Then slowly, and with a half vacant look, he added, “Yes; me go home. By and by me go home.” Not another word would he speak; and the white man left him, and went his way. A little while longer he stood watching the changing heavens; and then, with reluctant step, retired to his solitary wigwam. The next day, a tree, which Soonseetah had often said was just as old as their boy, was placed near the mother and child. A wild vine was straggling among the loose stones, and Powontonamo carefully twined it around the tree. “The young oak is the Eagle of the Mohawks,” he said; “and now the Sunny-eye has her arms round him.” He spoke in the wild music of his native tongue; but there was none to answer. “Yes; Powontonamo will go home,” sighed he. “He will go where the sun sets in the ocean, and the white man's eyes have never looked upon it.” One long, one lingering glance at the graves of his kindred, and the Eagle of the Mohawks bade farewell to the land of his fathers. * * * * * * For many a returning autumn, a lone Indian was seen standing at the consecrated spot we have mentioned; but, just thirty years after the death of Soonseetah, he was noticed for the last time. His step was then firm, and his figure erect, though he seemed old and way-worn. Age had not dimmed the fire of his eye, but an expression of deep melancholy had settled on his wrinkled brow. It was Powontonamo—he who had once been the Eagle of the Mohawks! He came to lie down and die beneath the broad oak, which shadowed the grave of Sunny-eye. Alas! the white man's axe had been there! The tree he had planted was dead; and the vine, which had leaped so vigorously from branch to branch, now, yellow and withering, was falling to the ground. A deep groan burst from the soul of the savage. For thirty wearisome years, he had watched that oak, with its twining tendrils. They were the only things left in the wide world for him to love, and they were gone! He looked abroad. The hunting land of his tribe was changed, like its chieftain. No light canoe now shot down the river, like a bird upon the wing. The laden boat of the white man alone broke its smooth surface. The Englishman's road wound like a serpent around the banks of the Mohawk; and iron hoofs had so beaten down the war-path, that a hawk's eye could not discover an Indian track. The last wigwam was destroyed; and the sun looked boldly down upon spots he had visited only by stealth, during thousands and thousands of moons. The few remaining trees, clothed in the fantastic mourning of autumn; the long line of heavy clouds, melting away before the coming sun; and the distant mountain, seen through the blue mist of departing twilight, alone remained as he had seen them in his boyhood. All things spoke a sad language to the heart of the desolate Indian. “Yes,” said he, “the young oak and the vine are like the Eagle and the Sunny-eye. The are cut down, torn, and trampled on. The leaves are falling, and the clouds are scattering, like my people. I wish I could once more see the trees standing thick, as they did when my mother held me to her bosom, and sung the warlike deeds of the Mohawks.” A mingled expression of grief and anger passed over his face, as he watched a loaded boat in its passage across the stream. “The white man carries food to his wife and children, and he finds them in his home,” said he. “Where is the squaw and the papoose of the red man? They are here!” As he spoke, he fixed his eye thoughtfully upon the grave. After a gloomy silence, he again looked round upon the fair scene, with a wandering and troubled gaze. “The pale face may like it,” murmered he; “but an Indian cannot die here in peace.” So saying, he broke his bow string, snapped his arrows, threw them on the burial place of his fathers, and departed for ever. * * * None ever knew where Powontonamo laid his dying head. The hunters from the west said, a red man had been among them, whose tracks were far off toward the rising sun; that he seemed like one who had lost his way, and was sick to go home to the Great 2 Spirit. Perchance, he slept his last sleep where the distant Missisippi receives its hundred streams. Alone, and unfriended, he may have laid him down to die, where no man called him brother; and the wolves of the desert, long ere this, may have howled the death-song of the Mohawk Eagle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SAGACIOUS PAPA: A HINT FOR THOSE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. “If a woman will, she will—you may depend on 't; And if she won't, she won't—so there's an end on't.” “I think it is very cruel of papa,” said Olive May,—a pretty little, pouting, petted, rose-bud beauty,—“I had rather he would refuse me any thing else, than try to cross me in my affections. I could never love anybody else but James Ingraham; yet he will try to persuade me that Robert King is much the best match. I wish I might never see that coxcomb again.” These peevish words were spoken to a fashionable aunt, “no longer Is-a-bel, but Was-a-belle,” who had abundantly proved the vanity of the world; “yet loved the dear delusion still.” A smile, half malicious and half playful, curled her thin lips, as she answered composedly, “You should never suffer yourself to speak in such a vixenish tone, Olive; you will spoil the sweetness of 2A your voice; and that would be a very great misfortune to a belle.” Then patting her cheek with her fan, she said, “I will go talk with this cruel father. He shan't abuse it, darling—It shall love who it pleases, and marry who it pleases; so it shall.” And Olive, hoping great things from her aunt Isabel's intercession, smiled sweetly, and was herself again. Before we acquaint our readers with the result of this intercession, we will give them a brief sketch of Olive's lovers. She had three declared ones; and a hundred, or so, that looked at her, and sighed for her fortune. The first in date, was James Ingraham; with whom she had become acquainted during her father's absence in Europe. He was a worthy young man; short and fat; with a sort of rosy, vulgar beauty about his square face; and the most important of all his qualifications was, that he was the very first lover Olive ever had. He had good abilities, and was a promising scholar; but he wore dirty white silk gloves, longer than his hand; and he would lean back in his chair; and some how or other his elbows were always making mathematical demonstrations; and his shoulders alone pourtrayed the curving line of beauty. The next was a Polish count, who showed a dozen stars and garters, and told how much he had suffered in the cause of liberty, and swore, forty times a week, that Olive was fairer than the moon, and his love eternal as the sun. Last of all, was Robert King, tall, graceful, well-proportioned, and just returned from Paris. In all external graces, he was a model; and the ladies only wondered at one thing, viz. that he should have spent two years in Paris, and yet wear his hair just as he did when he went away. But Robert King had studied the subject of his own physiognomy even more deeply than they had; elaborate thought, and patient experiment, had led him to the conclusion that he had chosen the best style for displaying his magnificent white forehead to advantage. Moreover, his residence in Europe had filled him with high hopes, and lofty aspirations: B2 when he left his native country, he was merely ambitious to follow every turn of fashion; but now, convinced he could outdo the volatile goddess, his great ambition was, that the fashion should follow him. The ladies were all in a twitter about him; he danced so lazily, and he flattered so delicately; and he drove such beautiful horses; and he so often made them think how difficult it was to please a man who had waltzed and sung with European beauties! To overcome his provoking indifference was a glorious achievement, which every one was anxious to perform. The victory was gained by Olive May, with her pretty face, and still prettier fortune, without an effort on her part; and probably for the very reason that he saw she made no effort. Robert King had the father's wishes and exertions on his side; for he was the son of a wealthy Broker, and the leading star of fashion. It was not at all wonderful that the fop should be preferred to the clown, and discount triumph over the Count. But Olive was not quite as wise as her father; for it is a lamentable fact that Providence seldom places old heads on lily-white shoulders. She had read in novels, that the first love never changed; and she was determined “to love James Ingraham forever, and forever; and should her cruel father disinherit her, she would love him the more— that she would.” Such was the state of affairs, when aunt Isabel volunteered her services. It seemed that she was eminently successful; for the next day, Mr. May told his daughter that he was very sorry to see her so unhappy; that since the subject was disagreeable to her, he would never again mention the name of Robert King; that he had a great regard for Mr. Ingraham, and certainly would not thwart her wishes by any opposition. One thing, however, he should expect her to yield to him; she was quite too young to be married at present; and it was absolutely necessary she should travel a little, to finish her education, and give her the air and manner of the world.” Olive was delighted at the thoughts of New-York and Saratoga; and she was sure she was very much delighted with permission to retain her old lover; but perhaps she felt a little disappointed, after all, to find the course of true love run so smooth—martyrdom is certainly a very exciting sort of thing, and mortals in all ages have been eager for it. Olive kissed aunt Isabel a hundred times over, and said she would write to James every day of her life; and asked what colours she thought most becoming; and had James' hair put into a golden locket; and sent all over the city for the last La Belle Assemblee, with its tasteful print of fashions; and ordered a dozen new sets of jewels, and tried twice a dozen styles of dressing her hair; and always ended all her operations by wondering whether James would pine away during her absence. What an odd jumble of gauze and love, trinkets and expectation, is the mind of a belle! The important day came; and the lovers parted with many vows. At New-York, at the Springs, at Quebec, every where, the world stood furbelowed and on tip-toe, to meet the beauty and the heiress! Her little head began to spin round; and no wonder that her heart began to spin with it. It is true they seldom unite their operations in the world of fashion; but then they are both unimportant articles—it is all the better to have extremely little of the one, and none at all of the other. At first, Olive adhered to her resolution of writing every day; but by and by she felt the necessity of letting the mail go without any token of her love. She danced so late; and she was so sleepy in the morning; and crowds of beaux came the moment she was dressed; and she found it was impossible to get along without a dozen new dresses; and positively the mantua-makers took so much of her time, that she could not write to James—she was sure he would'nt blame her, if he knew how she was situated. Her father reproved her for this neglect, and urged her not to let another day pass without sending a letter; and aunt Isabel reminded her how often she had said, “James would be lonesome as death when she was gone.” “I wish they would just let me alone,” thought the wayward beauty, “I wonder they need to tease me so. I am sure I love James just as well as ever I did. I wonder whether he wears silk gloves, now? I mean to tell him it is not genteel. I wish he could dance as well as Robert King—Robert King is certainly a very elegant young man; and all the young ladies are bewitched about him.” Our readers will naturally suppose that Olive was not gratified in her angry wish of “never seeing that coxcomb again.” Everywhere she went, he was her shadow. If she raised her eyes, she met his, resting upon her in silent worship; he sighed when she danced with another; and stood at her side when she was fatigued. All her companions envied her; and not one would allow she was beautiful. “He thinks I am,” thought Olive, as she glanced at her full length figure in the mirror; and as she sat with one tiny shoe in her hand, and the other half untied, she said audibly. “He is'nt so much of a coxcomb, after all.” “Who?” inquired aunt Isabel, with great gravity of manner. “Robert King, aunt; you know I used to detest him; but I really think he is quite agreeable. Don't you think he has altered very much lately?” “I think he has,” answered aunt Isabel: and unperceived by Olive, a mischievous light sparkled and mantled all over her face, as she held out a letter, saying, “Here is news from James.” Olive blushed deeply; and as she read the letter, the blush grew warmer and warmer. “Oh dear!” she exclaimed, “he does nothing but preach—preach. His letters are full of complaints and advice. I am sure he knows my constancy well enough—and he might know it is utterly impossible for me to write every day.” Now, the fact was, she had not written for four weeks—and three weeks more passed, and still she could not find time to write. Her father blamed her— and her aunt scolded her. It was very vexatious—but indeed it was impossible for her to write. At last James came, in person, to ascertain the state of affairs. She met him with blushes and welcomes—and she glanced her eye on Robert King, and then on him—and she wondered James would make a bow sideways—it was so very awkward. She danced with him, and she thought she saw the young ladies laugh. She asked him to go to dancing school, and to buy kid gloves. She wondered what made her father give up his opposition so easily—she wondered when Robert King meant to offer himself again—and she wondered when James was going away. Is there need to tell the catastrophe? James left the Springs in high displeasure; and papa and aunt Isabel exchanged very knowing looks. I leave good arithmeticians to balance the loss and gain—James lost the heart of a belle, and Olive gained the heart of a coxcomb!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO A LADY, CELEBRATED FOR MUSICAL TALENT. “Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so filled; Where the breeze warbles, and the mute, still air, Is Music slumbering on her instrument.” Coleridge. Thanks, Orphea, thanks! Thy magic spell Has waked my soul to sound; And deep within a sealed well A spring of joy is found! My ear was like the wayward strings, Which the wild winds breathe o'er; And fitful in its echoings, Has my spirit been before! But something in my inmost heart Responds to each touch of thine,— And bids me own thy wond'rous art The soul of the “tuneful Nine.” Yes, all I've dream'd of bright or fair, Is but embodied sound— Music is floating on the air, In every thing around! All Nature hath of breezy grace, In motion swift and free, Each lovely hue upon her face, Is living melody. Well might thy witchery inspire The bard's enraptured lay, And flashes of prophetic fire Around thy fingers play; But vainly would the haunted king Have sought relief from thee,— For chain'd had been each demon's wing By thy rich minstrelsy. Priestess of a mighty power! My spirit worships thee; For inspiration is thy dower— Thy voice is poetry!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RIVAL BROTHERS. A TALE OF THE REVOLUTION. “It is a fearful tale—yet true.” It was in the middle of one of the most delightful days in June, that I commenced a short journey, which led me through the cool sequestered forests on the eastern shore of Massachusetts. Few things are more enchanting, than to saunter through the woods during a summer's noon. Nature, enjoying the deep tranquillity of a most voluptuous repose, the gay warbling of the birds, changed for that occasional twitter which speaks the full enjoyment of their tiny hearts, more plainly than the rich burst of their morning song; the very butterflies, like gay coquettes, weary of conquest, closing and spreading their gorgeous wings in languid indifference; the deep shade; the drowsy splendour mantling the distant hills; all these bring to me a delicious sense of quiet existence, which no other scene produces. During my ride, every thing tended to heighten this feeling to the utmost. I could not mistake that I was in the land of my fore-fathers. Even Nature bears the aspect of those venerable heralds of our freedom; and Time, while he has led wealth, taste, and fashion, through all our favoured land, has passed by these secluded spots with religious awe, and scarcely brushed the antiquated scene with noiseless wing. The faces you meet are as a title-page, on which “by-gone days” are written; the children have the reverential demeanour of the olden time; the sea-breeze murmurs through the wood, with more of psalmody than song; and the very moss-grown stones have an air of Puritan sanctity. My companion was one with whom I was too familiar to strive to be agreeable; and they, who cannot be eloquent when effort is unnecessary, may forever despair of the power. Conversation is always delightful when the thoughts spring spontaneously from the tongue, attended with all the contagious exhilaration of wit and talent; but it is even more delightful, when catching its tone from surrounding objects, it flows gently on, deriving new charms from the scene around, and new interest from the circumstances under which we enjoy it. Such a conversation I was at this moment listening to from my companion, and every instant with increasing pleasure. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of one of the most frightful and loathsome-looking objects my eyes ever beheld. The lofty and projecting forehead, and the bold, rigid contour of the head, all indicated the possession of prodigious power; and the “spark of hell burning in his eye,” proved that power had been exerted for the prince of darkness. He was clothed in the squalid and tattered drapery of exceeding poverty; and deeply had age graven upon his iron visage the lines of guilt and passion. The painter and the sculptor could not have found a more fitting personification of pestilence or crime. At the sight of us, he darted into the woods with that instinctive aversion which ever leads the fallen spirit to shun a purer nature. My companion knew him well; and at my request, repeated the terrible incidents of his life. As nearly as I can recollect, they are contained in the following story. Among the numerous families who worshipped the Lord in the beauty of holiness, in 1776, few, even in the days of primitive devotion, were more blameless in life and conversation, than those of Eliphalet Warner and Lois Leslie. Their dwellings joined each other; and their children had grown up together, healthy and beautiful, as the trim shrubbery around their doors. Frances, the only daughter of the widow Leslie, was the sweetest little wild-flower that ever breathed fragrance on this sinful world. Seldom has nature blended in one countenance two such striking characteristics of loveliness. Mildness was the prevailing expression; and it was not until we had looked again and again upon her large blue eye, that it revealed its depth of meaning. Thought was there, not in the grandeur of beaming inspiration, but tranquil as a waveless lake, pure as the intelligence of angels, and joyous as infancy in its happy dreams. There is a nameless light in this spiritual kind of beauty. It comes from the sun of a world brighter and holier than our own. The painter, the poet, the sculptor, have never embodied it; and nature, with all her radiance, her bloom and purity, affords no metaphor. The mother, faded and care-worn, was still such a one as, once seen, could not easily be forgotten. Her face manly, but not masculine, in its outline, and energetic in its expression, indicated the possession of vehement feeling; but its serious and somewhat severe aspect, told that youthful enthusiasm had been checked by many sorrows, and that the waves of affection, repressed on every side, had worn a channel deep into the soul. An only son, the stay and staff of her old age, recently returned from the American camp, exhausted by long and painful illness, completed the number of their affectionate household. Mr. Warner, a rigid, but kind-hearted old man, had long been deprived of the partner of his youthful days. It was strange for one apparently so harsh in his nature, but though 3 his hand and his heart were ever open to his neighbour, and though his eye lighted up with all a father's joy when Frances stood before him in her loveliness, yet his thoughts were ever with her who slept his last sleep; and the old man lived in the bosom of his family, estranged from all others save the widow and her charming daughter. Two sons were all that remained to him, and they were a most striking instance of dissimilarity of character, produced by the same education, and the same habits of life. That intellect differs in native vigour in various individuals, and is strong in any peculiar department only from the accidental direction of attention, has been abundantly proved; but supposing the mind to be thus bent by circumstances and situation, how hard it is to trace the hidden causes, which create in the same family such various modifications of moral purity and mental force. Joseph and William Warner looked as unlike each other as they really were in pursuits and inclinations. Joseph was dark, lowering, and designing; with eyes deeply set, and looking out from beneath their shaggy brows, like the fiery balls of a tiger hidden in the clefts of a precipice. William's complexion was likewise dark, but his expression was extremely noble and ingenuous, and his face had much of fresh youthful beauty. Joseph was a furious Tory; William a firm and decided Whig. Both were the declared lovers of their fair neighbour; and both had been told by her judicious mother to wait for more peaceful times, and until maturer years should enable her to judge discreetly and decide wisely. In habits of unreserved intimacy with both—treated as a cherished sister by William, and the alternate object of the most headstrong love, and the most taunting jealousy of his fiery brother—it seemed for a long time doubtful how the balance would turn. I know not why it is, but impetuosity, ardour, and lordliness of manner, are usually exceedingly attractive to woman. It is, I believe, simply that worship of power, which exists in every human mind. The same principle that prostrates the soul before nature 3A in its wildness and majesty, and before art in its magnificent desolation, bows it down to the might and energy of man. Some have said that the fearless and unprincipled have readiest access to the female heart, merely because they are so; but they know little of woman's character who say or think this. If the unprincipled obtain superior influence, it is because boldness is mistaken for strength, and moral insanity for intellectual vigour. To the timid eye of Frances, a character torn and convulsed by contending passions seemed to have a fearful grandeur. Her reason told her that William was a thousand times more fitted to make her happy, but imagination hovered round the image of Joseph, and veiled its darkness with her own seraph wings. Her gentle nature shrunk from his ferocity, and she dreaded an influence which she always found tumultuous and exciting; but, like the bird charmed by a rattlesnake, the greater her fear the more powerful the attraction. Such was her state of feeling on the evening we choose to present her to our readers; and that night was one of deep interest to the whole village. The sergeant of a recruiting regiment was among them, and every one was awaiting the result of the draughts with painful anxiety. Young Leslie, dying for the cause in which his young comrades were about to engage, turned restlessly on his pillow, watching for the entrance of William Warner, with all the eagerness that weakness and lassitude would allow; and Frances and her mother, attending to his wants, and glancing at the window every time a cloud flitted across the declining sun, betrayed the same inquietude. At length the silence was interrupted by the entrance of William. Mother and daughter sprang forward to meet him; and the invalid fixed a most piercing look upon him. Not a word was spoken—but he felt what they would ask, and covering his face with both his hands, he exclaimed, “I am!” The sick man groaned deeply; Frances burst into a flood of tears; and the matron, with a firm countenance, but a bursting heart, clasped his hand warmly as she said, “Well, none but our God will be left to guard us now. 3B But go, my young friend, strong in the Lord of Hosts. These are solemn times. Men must act, and women must endure.” “Oh, if I could but act!” exclaimed the invalid; “oh, my bleeding country! that ever my arm should be weak at an hour like this.” “But, my dear William,” said Frances, “will it be very long before you return to us?” “It may be very long,” he replied; and his heart swelled almost to breaking, when he looked on the fair creature, and thought of the chance of battle. Before he could add more, his elder brother abruptly pushed before him. “There are others going, as well as you, sir,” exclaimed he, glancing at the tearful Frances, and eyeing William with the most malignant expression of jealousy and scorn. “Where,” asked the astonished widow;—“To the British camp,” was the surly reply. Young Leslie made a violent exertion to rise upon his elbow, but, exhausted with the effort, sank upon his pillow, with an expression in which indignation and pain were contending for victory. “Joseph,” said his brother, in a tender, but reproachful tone, “At least spare our good father this dreadful blow.” “Take care of your own concerns, Mr. Morality,” answered the renegade; “the old man ought to be proud of a red coat in his family.” “Heavens!” exclaimed William, “are not burning towns—gushing blood—a father struck to the earth in his old age, by a British officer;—are not all these enough to rouse you to a sense of outraged rights? I should glory to die in such a cause.” “God grant you may have your wish, brave brother of mine,” answered he, with a look of the most bitter hatred. Frances shrunk from him, as from a fiend. He had never before dared to unveil his depravity to her view; and her mother, though she well knew him to be fierce and ungovernable, was thrilled with horror at his demoniac expression. Finding himself an object of distrust and abhorrence, and trying in vain to exert his accustomed power over Frances, he left them at an early hour, without deigning to say one word of kindness or exculpation. Imagination thus rudely driven from the hold which reason had long ago represented as dangerous, clung to the excellent William, with a tenderness, which Frances had never before experienced for him. Mrs. Leslie had not suspected her predilection for Joseph; for deep and passionate love is seldom unreserved in its nature; and the ready smile of frank affection which she ever bestowed upon William, might well have been mistaken for feelings deeper than they really were. Beside the love they all bore him, their hearts were naturally softened towards one just about to engage in a doubtful and bloody cause; and the young man returned to his home that night, more than blessed in the conviction that the dangers which surrounded him had awakened affection where he most wished to awaken it. When Frances entered Mr. Warner's house the ensuing evening, she found the old man seated at his door, in a high wicker backed chair. Beside him lay a heavy, brazen-hilted sword, on which his eye rested with a sort of uneasy abstraction. At the sound of her voice, he raised his head, and gave one of those beaming looks of welcome, which her presence always called forth. “You've said a kind farewell to my boy,” exclaimed he, “and blessing on you for it. He will go forth to his duty with a lighter heart.” “And Joseph, he is gone too?” said she, blushing slightly. “Name him not!” replied the old man, with sternness in his voice and manner. “He has quarreled with his father, curst the best of brothers, and last night left us, without one farewell, to join the hateful oppressors of his country.” “I have always thought,” said Frances, in an agitated tone, “that his words were more wicked than his intentions.” “I have hoped so, till of late,” replied he, “and it is even now hard for a father's heart to believe in the guilt of a son; but do you know, my child, that when I told him he did not deserve the sword of his ancestors, and that I should give it to his younger brother, he cursed me to my face, and would have stabbed William to the heart. Oh! he is black with crime. Wo be to all who have part or lot with him.” The sound of distant drums here interrupted the conversation. It grew nearer and nearer, and presently a ragged, miserably equipped, and worse disciplined, band came upon the sight; yet women and children, the aged and infirm, welcomed them with more heartfelt gratitude, and deeper respect, than has often been given to the glittering pageantry of military despots. Who, that saw that wretched troop of young patriots eagerly marching to join the standard of Washington and the youthful La Fayette, would have believed that, ere half a century had elapsed, the aged La Fayette would have been welcomed in the flourishing capital of New-England, with all the magnificence of wealth, “the pomp and circumstance of war!” Who could have believed that the infant, then presented at Freedom's altar, there to be baptized in blood and tears, would so soon have been a giant among the nations? The music, loud, rapid, and merry, spoke the cheerfulness of the departing regiment; but when the dwelling of Mr. Warner and the widow Leslie came in view, by one unanimous impulse the music ceased, the march stopped—and dividing to right and left, they lowered their guns to the father of William Warner. There were peculiar reasons why these houses were dear to them all. There was young Leslie, who had gone forth at the loud call of his country's distress as healthy and buoyant as they—and how had he returned? To send forth the soul in one agonizing bound of the field of battle, had few terrors for youthful enthusiasm; but the stoutest hearts shuddered at days of wearisome sickness, and the slow progress of loathsome decay. Then there was the venerable father of Warner, whose sage counsels were the oracles of the village, and whose intrepid spirit had given nerve and sinew to them all. There was the widow Leslie, who always had a smile, as cheerful and encouraging as if the last stay of her old age was not about to be reft from her in this hour of need. Then there was Frances, so lovely, so beloved, bringing the strongest claim that can be brought to the heart of man—that of helpless beauty and unguarded innocence. Therefore it was that, while mothers, sisters and infant brothers, were looking from every door and window, they chose to halt here, and pay their last farewell. Often, during their brief march, they had stopped to give their little ones a parting kiss, and to receive the prayers, tears, and blessings of those who were near and dear. But now they paused for the last time; and they paused, too, where every thing conspired to make their last adieu more agonizing. “Come to me, William,” said the old man, in a clear, firm tone. The youth stepped forward, and lowering his hand on his rifle, kneeled at his father's feet. “My son,” continued he, “here is the sword of your brave old grandfather. It did deadly execution in the French war; and his hand was clenched around it in his dying hour. It is an heir-loom in the family, and should have been given to my oldest boy; but”— his voice choked, and for a moment the veteran covered his face with his hands, and rested on the hilt of the weapon. “Farewell, my son, my only son,” continued he, in a trembling voice, “I can go down to my grave alone. The God of Israel bless thee, and anoint thee with strength for these times of peril.” The young soldier pressed his father's hand with a convulsive grasp, gave one long, one lingering, farewell to the spot where his beloved Frances stood by the side of her mother, and fearing to trust a single word, hastily rejoined his companions. There was not a dry eye among them; and when they came directly in front of Mrs. Leslie's, all involuntarily uttered a shuddering groan. James Leslie had entreated to be bolstered up in his chair, to take a last look of his youthful associates. There he sat, pale, wasted, and agonized with pain; his head reposing upon his mother's bosom, and his sister standing beside him like a seraph at the couch of the dying. An unnatural intensity of light poured from his eyes, and he raised his hand in a faint attempt to make a victorious flourish, as he exclaimed, “God will give us the victory.” He started up, with one sudden bound of anguish—his head sunk on his shoulder—the glazed eyes remained fixed on the youthful band before him; but they saw no longer. To the young soldiers there was something dreadfully attractive in the rayless look of the corpse before them. It seemed as if the very dead urged them onward. William would have given his life to have returned for a while to his friends, to aid and sooth them in this dreadful trial; but a longer time than usual had already been allowed to the indulgence of personal feeling, and the officers were impatient of delay. The music struck up; and amid sobs, and groans, and tears, with brave but lacerated hearts, they bade a long farewell to their humble homes. Sad, sad indeed, was the dwelling of the widow Leslie on the ensuing day. Alas! how little do we appreciate the courage of our fathers, and the fortitude of our mothers, at the soul-trying period of our revolution. In all scenes of public distress, woman is compelled to make exertions, not the less painful, or the less difficult, because they are not performed on the public theatre of a sympathising world. To fasten the knapsack round a father's neck, to fill the cartridges of a beloved husband, and see him go forth to battle, when his little ones are crying for bread, and his desolate home is left at the mercy of the ravager; to have none left to dig the grave of an only son, and to consign him to the cold, damp earth, wept over only by the aged and the helpless, require no ordinary effort of human strength. Yet such were but every-day scenes, during our desperate struggle for independence. Mrs. Leslie bore her sorrows with even more firmness than distinguished most women of that period. True, she was staid, and sometimes melancholy, like one who had left behind her all the verdant spots in the wearisome desert of life; yet she was ever active in her duties, ever ready to sympathise in the griefs and anxieties of others. The voice of Frances lost nothing of its melodious kindness, and the matrons of the village looked on her light step with as much pride as they had in the happy days of her childhood; but a shadow had passed over the sunshine of her face, and when she smiled on her mother, it was in the deep sadness of anxious love. Months passed away. The far-off din of battle came to them, only in broken and uncertain echoes. In the new state of the country, and at that troubled period, all communication between the army and their friends was difficult and dangerous. Nothing was known of Joseph since his abrupt departure. Whether he had actually joined the British forces, or merely secreted himself from his infuriated countrymen, remained doubtful. William had not been seen or heard of, since the thrilling look of tenderness and pity which he gave to Frances, as she stood by the side of her lifeless brother; but morning and evening, fervent prayers for his safety arose from the lips of those by whom he was so deservedly beloved. Left to the quiet communion of her own spirit, Frances found that her affection for him had taken deep and vigorous root. Each succeeding day increased its power; for it is one of the strangest perversities of love, that absence strengthens it far more than constant presence. The memory of his devotedness to her and her widowed parent was associated with every thing around her; and each day, some deficiency in their household comfort reminded them of the industry and kindness which had so promptly supplied their wants. A thousand nameless attentions, trifling in themselves, but invaluable to a woman's heart, crowded upon her memory. She sent him a letter, in which this state of feeling was most frankly expressed; and when one tedious week after another passed away, she gave herself up to the conviction that it had never reached him. A brief note did, however, at last arrive. It contained merely violent protestations of unalterable attachment, and besought her to meet him, between the hours of six and seven, in an adjoining wood. It stated that life and death depended on her secresy, and that even her mother must not know of the interview. “Why is this mystery,” thought Frances, as she read and re-read the singular epistle. “Probably he has stolen from military duty, and detection would be death,” said she to herself, “yet surely my mother might know of it.” All her conjectures ended in the supposition that William had some good reason, and that she ought to comply with his request. Fear never once crossed her guileless imagination. William had, from his cradle, been to her as a brother; and to distrust him was like dreading contagion in the pure balmy air she had breathed from childhood. At an early hour she was seen passing through the village,—her little, well-known gypsy-hat lightly resting on a profusion of glossy hair, beautiful as a “shower of sunbeams.” She had given a parting kiss to her mother and Mr. Warner, with a joyousness for which they could not account; and as her slender little figure passed along like a vision of light, the neighbours all remarked that her smile was brighter, and her step far more buoyant than usual. Evening came and she returned not. The fears of the anxious mother increased to dreadful intensity. At last a traveller told of horrible screams which he had heard from the wood. A large band of old men, women, and children, suddenly collected, and hastened to the spot he indicated. Alas! the hand of violence had cut her down in her youth and beauty! The lovely face, still and pale as marble, had yet a shadow of the imploring look which last passed over it; her long, fair hair was tangled in the shrubbery; and the sword, which had been a farewell present to her lover, lay all bloody at her side. Those who heard her mother's shriek, carried the remembrance of it to their graves. She had endured much, but her burden was mightier than she could bear. She never smiled after she had looked upon that fearful sight. Her short life was but protracted agony; and before three months had elapsed, she slept by the side of her murdered daughter. There needed no sybil to point out the assassin. When the light of their lanthorns first fell on the lifeless being so dear to them all, the wretched father of William Warner clasped his hands in convulsive agony, and groaned out, “Oh! Joseph, Joseph!” And he indeed it was, whose guilty hands had thus madly torn the beauteous one from life, and its most enchanting hopes. His hatred of a brother, whose excellence he would not imitate, had been greatly increased by the transfer of the sword to him, and by a parting 4 interview, which he had overheard, between him and Frances. Deservedly surpassed in his father's affections, and rivalled in his passionate love, his haughty spirit was goaded to the utmost. The night he left them, he swore to his own soul a deep and sure revenge. He sought the American camp in the character of a spy; he obtained access to the barracks of the unsuspicious William, and seizing the fatal sword, which had so much embittered his malice, he aimed a death-blow at his only brother. A struggle ensued, and William was well nigh proving victorious, when in the voice of his earlier years he exclaimed “William!” The sword dropped at his feet; he seized it; and before his brother had recovered from his consternation, Joseph had gone beyond recall. This adventure a little softened his ferocious nature; and perhaps the dreadful resolution he had taken would never have been kept, had not an American been brought into the enemy's camp, under the imputation of carrying important papers to the rebels; but Frances's letters by these means came into his hand. Stung to the soul with jealousy and rage, he again swore the horrid vow. We have already told how she was decoyed into his presence. It matters not what were the insults and the heart-cutting words he heaped upon her. It was a shocking detail, and I would fain spare the repetition of it. Suffice it to say, he talked, with fiend-like malignity, of love crossed and ambition thwarted; he reproached her with broken promises and disappointed hopes; and when she refused to pollute her soul with false vows, he sealed his oath with blood! William lived to hear the agonized tidings. He lived, too, again to spare his wicked brother, when his sword flourished over him in the tumult of battle; but ever after that, he seemed to rush upon his death. After one of the sanguinary conflicts which immediately preceded our independence, he was found dead in the very centre of the British army. His father lived to extreme old age, as happy as the sympathy of his countrymen, and a firm trust in the Rock of Ages, could make one who had passed through such a 4A fiery ordeal. Joseph never saw him after the death of Frances Leslie; but the depraved wretch survived them all; and it is not many years since he was seen seated on the road side in Plymouth county, as we described him at the commencement of our story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">YOU 'VE BEEN CAPTAIN LONG ENOUGH. As I was walking up Beacon-street, the other day, I met a little republican corps, which greatly amused me. The band consisted of four boys, from six to ten years of age, accoutred in childish fashion, with pasteboard caps and tin swords. The troop was merely large enough to furnish captain, lieutenant, ensign, and trumpeter—a fair epitome of some of our military establishments. Being all of them in office, I very naturally concluded they were satisfied and happy; but my eye had not followed the young soldiers far, when I perceived the lieutenant (a sturdy urchin, about six years old,) make a decided halt. “What is the matter, Jack?” called out the captain. “I tell you what, Andrew, you've been captain long enough,” was the reply;—“I'm going to be captain now.” Some altercation followed; and the refractory 4B lieutenant vociferated still more loudly, “You've been captain long enough —it is my turn now.” A compromise was at length effected; and the ambitious little rebel agreed to budge a few yards further, satisfied with the promise of rotation in office at the end of the street. I could not refrain from laughing, as the little pageant moved out of sight. “This,” said I, “is an abridgement of human society —here is the genuine spirit of man.” That little troop recurs to my memory as frequently as Franklin thought of his dearbought whistle. When I hear selfish politicians keeping up an angry clamour about “reform,” I say to myself, “Ha! your troop would be all officers; and even then the most contemptible among ye would soon prove insubordinate, and exclaim, “I tell you what, Andrew, it is my turn to be captain now.” When I see a lover all devotion, or a young husband all indulgence, I wonder how long it will be before he will say, “You've been captain long enough. It is my turn now.” When a blooming young girl asks, “Don't you think Isabel begins to fade?” I imagine her ambitious little heart is whispering, “She has been captain long enough.” When I hear a belle congratulate a rival upon her marriage, it sounds to my ear very much like, “It is my turn to be captain now.” When I hear writers declare, in a most oracular tone, that Miss Sedgwick will never rival her early productions, I am half tempted to answer, “Nay, my friend, she has not been captain long enough. We must content ourselves with being lieutenants.” I might mention a hundred things, which bring the discontented little officer to my mind; but I forbear, lest my readers should impatiently exclaim, “I tell you what,— you've been captain long enough!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LINES, OCCASIONED BY HEARING A LITTLE BOY MOCK THE OLD SOUTH BELL RINGING THE HOUR OF TWELVE. Aye, ring thy shout to the merry hours! Well may ye part in glee! From their sunny wings they scatter flowers, And laughing look on thee! Thy thrilling voice has started tears— It brings to mind the day, When I chased butterflies and years, And both flew fast away. Then my glad thoughts were few and free,— They came but to depart; They did not ask where heaven could be— 'Twas in my little heart. I since have sought the meteor crown, Which fame bestows on men— How gladly would I throw it down, To be so gay again! But youthful joy has gone away— In vain 'tis now pursued! Such rainbow glories only stay Around the simply good. I know too much to be as blest As when I was like thee; My spirit, reason'd into rest, Has lost its buoyancy. Yet still I love the winged hours— We often meet in glee; And sometimes, too, are fragrant flowers Their farewell gifts to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOUGHTS. ...“I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling was the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.” Wordsworth. The day was closing in, and as I sat watching the scarcely moving foliage of a neighbouring elm, my mind gradually sank into a state of luxurious repose, amounting to total unconsciousness of all the busy sights and sounds of earth. It seemed to me as if I were seated by a calm, deep lake, surrounded by graceful and breezy shrubbery, and listening to most delicious music. The landscape differed from anything I had ever seen. Light seemed to be in every thing, and to emanate from every thing, like a glory. Yet I felt at home; and could I see a painting of it, I should know it as readily as the scenes of my childhood. And so it is with a multitude of thoughts that come suddenly into the soul, new as visitants from farthest Saturn, yet familiar as a mother's voice. Whence do they come? Is Plato's suggestion something more than poetry? Have we indeed formerly lived in a luminous and shadowless world, where all things wear light as a garment? And are our bright and beautiful thoughts but casual glimpses of that former state? Are all our hopes and aspirations nothing but recollections? Is it to the fragments of memory's broken mirror we owe the thousand fantastic forms of grandeur, or of loveliness, which fancy calls her own? And the gifted ones, who now and then blaze upon the world, and “darken nations when they die,”—do they differ from other mortals only in more cloudless reminiscences of their heavenly home? Or are we living, separate existences, at one and the same time. Are not our souls wandering in the spirit-land while our bodies are on earth? And when in slumber, or deep quietude of thought, we cast off `this mortal coil,' do we not gather up images of reality, that seem to us like poetry? Might not the restless spirit of Byron have indeed learned of “archangels ruined” those potent words, which, like infernal magic, arouse every sleeping demon in the human heart? Are dreams merely visits to our spirithome; and are we in sleep really talking with the souls of those whose voice we seem to hear? As death approaches and earth recedes, do we not more clearly see that spiritual world, in which we have all along been living, though we knew it not? The dying man tells us of attendant angels hovering round him. Perchance it is no vision—they may have often been with him, but his inward eye was dim, and he saw them not. What is that mysterious expression, so holy and so strange, so beautiful yet so fearful, on the countenance of one whose soul has just departed? Is it the glorious light of attendant seraphs, the luminous shadow of which rests awhile on the countenance of the dead? Does infancy owe to this angel crowd its peculiar power to purify and bless? “Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LA ROSIERE: OR, THE TRIUMPH OF GOODNESS. “Loving she is, and tractable, though wild; And innocence hath privilege in her To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes.” Wordsworth. In France there is an old and very graceful custom, called the fete of la Rosiere. On this occasion those in authority publicly present a garland of roses to the best and most beautiful girl in the village. This custom had its origin deep in national feeling and true morality; but, alas! wheresoever human passion can creep in, they leave their slime upon the roses of life—the fete of la Rosiere, like other triumphs, too often becomes an affair of jealous rivalry and petty intrigue. Angelique Duroy was one of the very prettiest of her bewitching countrywomen. Her clear, dark eye was neither flashing nor languid—it had a quiet, deep expression, brilliant yet thoughtful; her complexion inclined to olive; but the perpetual colour that mantled there, gave her cheek the tempting ripeness of tropical fruit; while the laughing dimples on either side came and went, like whirlpools in a sunny stream. Every thing in her look and motion argued an exuberance of life and happiness. Her voice had the clear, gushing melody of the thrush, her little nimble graceful feet made one think of a swallow just ready to take wing; and altogether she was so small, so airy, so pretty, so gay, and so musical, that I am sure if ner soul transmigrates, it will pass into a yellow-bird, or a Java-sparrow. The young men all admired Angelique, because she was so lady-like and unaffected; the old people loved her because she was such a good child to her parents, and always so kind and respectful to the aged—while the children, when asked, were always ready to say, “We love Angelique best, because she is always so good-natured and obliging, and she knows how to make us so many pretty things.” Indeed, Angelique was famous for her ingenuity and industry. After examining anything, she always found out how to do it without being taught; and what she did, she always did well. The prettiest dresses and bonnets in the village were made by her; and her artificial flowers were so natural, that I think the very honey-bees would have been deceived by them. Some told her if she went to Paris she would make a fortune by her ingenuity; but Angelique blushed, and said she had rather live with her good mother, than grow rich among strangers. It is strange this artless little French girl should have enemies; for she never had an uncommonly pretty cap, or garland, that she was not perfectly willing to make her young companions one just like it; but great gifts, if borne ever so meekly, do excite envy— Angelique had her enemies. The daughter of the Maire of the village was eight or nine years older than Angelique; and she never from her childhood had been either pretty, or amiable. She was very rich, very idle, very haughty, and very jealous. It vexed her that her fairy neighbour, unadorned, save by her own tasteful industry, should be so much more admired than she was, with all her jewelry and Parisian finery. Besides, she had long been in love with the son of a wealthy proprietaire; and this young man, when urged by his father to make suit to so great an heiress, openly declared that his affections were engaged to Angelique. This made the father very angry—he called it a boyish passion. “Antoinette is the only child of the Maire, and he has immense wealth and high character; will you give up such an union, when father and daughter both evidently wish for it, merely for the sake of a pretty plaything, a giddy little butterfly, like Angelique Duroy?” said he. The young man insisted that Angelique was as good as she was pretty; that she was capable, industrious, modest, and noble-hearted—“As a proof of it,” contined he, “every one in the village, except Antoinette, says the Cure will crown her at the fete of la Rosiere.” The proprietaire was a kind-hearted, wise, old man; his neighbours called him odd,— but his oddity was always of a benevolent kind. “Well, Jacques,” said he, “if the girl has so many good qualities, besides her pretty looks, I won't be obstinate about being convinced. I know Angelique has resolutely refused to receive any attention from you without the knowledge and approbation of her mother and myself—this speaks well— but how do you know that the young lady will smile upon your suit?” Jacques looked down, blushed very slightly, hesitated—then looked up with an arch look, and said, “If she knew you gave your approbation, I, at least, might try.” The old man smiled—“Well, well,” said he, “I see how it is. The girl, though not rich, is highly respectable. I will attend the fete of la Rosiere; you shall dance with the crowned fair one; and if I think she deserves this distinction, Angelique shall be to me as a daughter.” Jacques knelt down and kissed his father's hand with overflowing gratitude. He had not expected to gain his point so easily; for he knew his father had very much set his heart upon joining his estates to those of the Maire. “You are the best father in the world!” exclaimed he. “You call me so Jacques—the world will say I am an old fool; but after all, what do we live for, if not for happiness?” Away went the young man, in the fullness of his joy, to impart the tidings to Angelique; and she, above all petty coquetry, heard it with unaffected delight. The fete of la Rosiere was anxiously awaited. Every body so often repeated that Angelique would certainly be crowned, for she was la plus belle et la plus bonne, that modest as she was, she could not help expecting it. The important day came—and who do you think was crowned? Antoinette, the ugly, idle daughter of the Maire! she was crowned the best and most beautiful! The Maire gave a great ball that night. Angelique went; for she was above showing any resentment. She saw Jacques dancing with la Rosiere—she saw that his father 5 observed her closely; and though she could not be gay, she was cheerful and dignified. Antoinette whispered to her companions, “See what bold airs she puts on: I should think she would be mortified, when she and all her friends have been boasting that she would be crowned.” The old proprietaire heard one or two such speeches as this, and he shook his head expressively. He disappeared from the room a short time; while he was gone, his sister, a maiden lady, came up to Angelique: “My dear child,” said she, “there is something wrong about this affair —all the village said you would be crowned.” “My friends flattered me,” said Angelique, modestly; “I knew they thought more highly of me than I deserved.” “But think of crowning Antoinette!” continued the lady— “Such an ugly, sluttish thing as she is!” “Her dress is very becoming,” said Angelique; “and I think she is the best dancer in the room:” the tears came to her eyes as she said this; for Jacques was again dancing with la Rosiere, and her garland of Provence roses was very beautiful. Angelique retired very early that night,— not without a kind look from Jacques, and an expression of benevolent approbation from the old proprietaire and his maiden sister. As soon as she reached her own little bedroom, she knelt down, and bursting into tears, prayed that all envious and repining thoughts might be subdued within her heart. The prayer proved to be a strength and a consolation; and she soon sunk to sleep as sweetly as an infant. Jacques came the next day. He was loud in his complaints. He said the whole village was indignant about it. Much good might the crown of roses do Miss Antoinette!—Nobody thought she deserved it. He knew one thing, the Maire had given the Cure a splendid suit of clothes just before the fete; and he himself had seen Antoinette's diamond ring on his finger. No wonder the Cure gave the crown to a rich man's daughter. “Nay, I do not think the Cure could do so wrong as to take bribes from anybody,” replied Angelique; “and I beg you will not say so.” “All the village think so,” replied 5A Jacques; “and they always will think so. I danced with her, because my father said it would give offence if I did not, on such an occasion; but I will never dance with her again.” “I am sure she is one of the best dancers I ever saw,” answered Angelique. Nothing soothed by her gentleness, Jacques went away more indignant than ever, that so good a girl should be thus wronged. A week or two after, a great ball was given by the proprietaire. He himself called to invite Angelique; and in the intervening time, hardly a day passed without his spending an hour or two at her parent's dwelling. The more he saw of her, the more he was convinced that she was a good girl, and worthy of his son. When the evening of the ball arrived, Angelique and her family were received at his large mansion with distinguished kindness. “Before the dancing begins, I have a whim to be gratified,” said the kind-hearted, but eccentric old man. There was a universal hum of assent among the assembly; for the wealthy old landlord was very popular; and a proposition of his could at any time be carried by acclamation in the village. The old gentleman smiled, and holding up a wreath of roses and orange-buds, he said, “There were once two Popes in the church; why should there not be two crowned la Rosiere?” As he spoke, he placed the garland on the head of Angelique. “I crown her, because I have proved that she cannot be tempted to speak ill of a rival,” said he; “the roses are my own gift,—the orange-buds came from a younger hand.” Angelique blushed crimson; for orange-buds form the bridal wreath in France. She looked up timidly; Jacques was at her side, the music struck up “C'est l' amour, l' amour,” and the exulting lover led her to the dance amid the applauses of the guests. Angelique afterwards found that the good maiden lady had been instructed to try her generosity, and that the father of Jacques had been a concealed listener to her replies. Antoinette was not invited to the proprietaire's ball. He said he had learned instances of her art and selfishness, which had destroyed all esteem for her; but that he 5B would not openly insult her by the triumph of one she had always tried to injure. Soon after, Angelique actually wore the white veil and the orange-buds, to the village church; and the Maire and his daughter left a place where they had never been popular, and now were odious. By the influence of the proprietaire, a new Cure was appointed before the next fete of la Rosiere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADDRESS TO THE VALENTINE PAINTED BY W. ALLSTON, IN THE POSSESSION OF GEORGE TICKNOR, ESQ. What are thy thoughts, thou placid one? Thy glance is mild as evening sun; Holy and bright the lucid beam, As love and hope were in thy dream. Calm are thy feelings—still and deep As seraph's joy, or infant's sleep. Not thine the British Sappho's eye,[1] [1] L. E. L. With love's volcano blazing high: Flush'd cheek and passion-stricken brow, Are not for one so pure as thou; Thou 'rt not a thing all smiles and tears, Wasting thy soul in hopes and fears; Yet thou, sweet maiden, can'st not hide Affection's deep and noiseless tide. A sadden'd hue is on thy cheek— Thy thoughtful look is still and meek; And well I know that young Love flings A shadow from his purple wings. 'Tis sad to think life's sunlight gleam May leave thee, like a morning dream. Can brows so gentle and so fair, Be early mark'd by with'ring care? Ah! listen to the plaintive tone O'er all Felicia's[2] [2] Mrs. Hemans. music thrown! Heaven spare thee the thrilling sigh, That wakes her harp to melody! There's subtle power in every line Of that bewitching Valentine; If once within the throbbing heart, Nor time, nor change, bids it depart, And seldom it's a quiet guest, In woman's fond, devoted breast. New thoughts may fire the weary brain, But hearts, once chill'd, ne'er warm again. Yet, lady, trust the dang'rous boy! His smiles are full of light and joy; And e'en his most envenom'd dart, Is better than a vacant heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BLESSED INFLUENCE OF THE STUDIES OF NATURE. “Thou shalt see and hear The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible Of that eternal language, which thy God Utters, who from eternity doth teach Himself in all, and all things in himself. Great universal Teacher! He shall mould Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask. Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee.” Coleridge. “Stand out of my sunshine!” said Diogenes to Alexander, when the emperor asked what service he could render him. Haughty as the philosopher's reply may sound, it merely expresses the honest independence, which every highly cultivated and well balanced mind may feel towards those, who possess nothing better than the accidental distinctions of rank or fortune. He indeed deserves our pity, who needs the condescending smile of the proud, or the heartless flattery of the vain, either to rouse him to exertion, or warm him into happiness. The power of self-excitement is the most desirable of all attainments, and it is the most rare. To love knowledge merely for its usefulness—to form and strengthen virtuous dispositions, with the hope of no other reward than the deep tranquillity they bring— is a task achieved by few; yet it is the only simple and direct road to lasting happiness. He who can find intellectual excitement in the fall of an apple, or the hues of a wild flower, may well say to the officious world, “Stand out of my sunshine!” To him Nature is an open volume, where truths of the loftiest import are plainly written; and the temptations and anxieties of this life have no power to cast a shadow on its broad and beautiful pages. I do not mean that solitude is bliss, even where enjoyment is of the purest kind. An eminence, that places us above the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows of social life, must indeed be an unenviable one; but that which puts us beyond the reach of the ever-varying tide of circumstance and opinion, is surely desirable; and nothing on which the mind can be employed tends so much to produce this state of internal sunshine, as the study of Nature in her various forms. Politics, love of gain, ambition of renown, —every thing, in short, which can be acted upon by the passions of mankind,—have a corroding influence on the human soul. But Nature, ever majestic and serene, moves on with the same stately step and beaming smile, whether a merchantman is wrecked, or an empire overthrown. The evils of man's heart pollute all with which they can be incorporated; but they cannot defile her holy temple. The doors are indeed closed against the restless and the bad; but the radiant goddess is ever at the altar, willing to smile upon all who are pure enough to love her quiet beauty. Ambition may play a mighty game—it may task the sinews of nations, and make the servile multitude automaton dancers to its own stormy music; but sun, and moon, and stars, go forth on their sublime mission, independent of its power; and its utmost efforts cannot change the laws which produce the transient glory of the rainbow. Avarice may freeze the genial current of affection, and dry up all the springs of sympathy within the human soul; but it cannot diminish the pomp of summer, or restrain the prodigality of autumn. Fame may lead us on in pursuit of glittering phantoms, until the diseased mind loses all relish for substantial good; but it cannot share the eternity of light, or the immortality of the minutest atom. He who has steered his bark, ever so skilfully, through the sea of politics, rarely, if ever, finds a quiet haven. His vexations and his triumphs have all been of an exciting character; they have depended on outward circumstances, over which he had very limited power; and when the turbulent scene has passed away, he finds, too late, that he has lived on the breath of others, and that happiness has no home within his heart. And what is the experience of him who has existed only for wealth? who has safely moored his richly-freighted vessel in the spacious harbour of successful commerce?— Does he find that happiness can, like modern love, be bought with gold? You may see him hurrying about to purchase it in small quantities, wherever the exhibitions of taste and talent offer it for sale; but the article is too ethereal to be baled for future use, and it soon evaporates amid the emptiness of his intellectual warehouse. He that lives only for fame, will find that happiness and renown are scarcely speaking acquaintance. Even if he could catch the rainbow he has so eagerly pursued, he would find its light fluctuating with each changing sunbeam, and fading at the touch of every passing cloud. Nor is he who has wasted the energies of his youth in disentangling the knotty skein of controversy, more likely to find the evening of his days serene and tranquil. The demon of dogmatism, or of doubt, may have grappled him closely, and converted his early glow of feeling, and elasticity of thought, into rancorous prejudice, or shattered faith. But the deep streams of quiet thought and pure philosophy gush forth abundantly from all the hiding-places of Nature; there is no drop of bitterness at the fountain; the clear waters reflect none of the Proteus forms of human pride; and ever, as they flow, their peaceful murmurs speak of heaven. The enjoyment that depends on powerful excitement saps the strength of manhood, and leaves nothing for old age but discontent and desolation. Yet we need amusements in the decline of life, even more than in its infancy; and where shall we find any so safe, satisfactory, and dignified, as battery and barometer, telescope and prism? Electric power may be increased with less danger than man's ambition; it is far safer to weigh the air than a neighbour's motives; it is more disquieting to watch tempests lowering in the political horizon, than it is to gaze at volcanoes in the moon; and it is much easier to separate and unite the colours in a ray of light, than it is to blend the many-coloured hues of truth, turned out of their course by the sharp corners of angry controversy. Finally, he who drinks deeply at the fountain of natural science, will reflect the cheerfulness of his own spirit on all things around. If the sympathy of heart and mind be within his reach, he will enjoy it more keenly than other men; and if solitude be his portion, he can, in the sincerity of a full and pious mind, say to all the temptations of fame and pleasure, “Stand ye out of my sunshine!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RECLUSE OF THE LAKE. “Man and boy, He'd been an idler in the land, Contented if he might enjoy The things that others understand.” Wordsworth. In the immediate vicinity of Lake George there was, a few years since, an humble dwelling, which always attracted the traveller's attention, though there was nothing peculiar about it, save a rich sloping greensward in front, and a luxuriant honeysuckle, which almost concealed the door, and loaded the air with its fragance. A stranger would have supposed that woman's tasteful hand had been there, adorning poverty itself with “wreathed smiles;” but seldom had her foot pressed the verdant velvet of that turf, and no female hand trained the graceful tendrils of that exuberant vine. The romantic little spot was the solitary home of Arthur Vanderlyn, an artist and a poet! No chilling disappointment, no embittered misanthropy, occasioned his retirement from the world. He never indulged that false idea, so shameful to intellect, that the powerful tide of genius must necessarily be turbid and restless. In him, it was a clear, deep, sunny stream, reflecting all of bright and beautiful in earth, or heaven; but his nature was timid, and he shrank from the ostentation of learning, the pageantry of wealth, and the officiousness of vulgarity, as things which could neither obtain his sympathy, nor endurance. The Recluse was the only son of a wealthy Batavian merchant, who had sent him to New-England to be educated. His mother had died when he was a mere babe; and his father carefully concealed from him the amount of his large fortune, lest the knowledge should early lead him to extravagance and dissipation. This well-founded anxiety induced him to make a very singular arrangement in the disposal of his wealth. Arthur Vanderlyn was nineteen years old when he quitted the University; and on that day, he received tidings of his father's death, and became acquainted with the contents of his will. Fifteen thousand dollars were to be paid him immediately; twenty thousand more, when he was thirty years of age; and his whole fortune, without reserve, on his forty-fifth birthday; but, in case one hundred dollars were ever borrowed in advance, his title was to be transferred to a distant relative. Limited as this income was, compared to what it would have been, if left to the ordinary course of law, the young student thought it amply sufficient to accomplish all his favourite projects. After travelling in New-York a few weeks, he purchased the cottage we have mentioned, then almost in a ruinous condition. He made no very important change in the exterior of the dwelling; but within, carpets, ottomans, vases, and mirrors, proclaimed a wealthy and tasteful resident. His own portrait, distinguished by its strong, bold, peculiar light; views of the surrounding scenery—some wild and fearful enough for the pencil of Salvator Rosa, and others, calm, sequestered, and luxuriant, as the spots over which Claude loved to throw his bland, warm colouring;—a guitar, piano, four or five fine flutes, and a time-piece, of Genevan workmanship, in which the hours with winged feet flew round, offering rose-wreaths to each other; all served to give the interior of the mansion something of the magic beauty of fairy land. The neighbours made various ingenious attempts to explore a place, of which many a wonderful tale was told; but Arthur Vanderlyn avoided all society with a coldness and hauteur, which at once excited curiosity and forbade intrusion. A stud of noble horses, a leash of beautiful greyhounds, a fine collection of birds, and one favourite man servant, were his only companions. Yet his disposition was kind, and his feelings social. The buzzing of insects, the twittering of birds, and the ringing laughter of childhood, filled him with delightful sensations. 6 Much of religion, too, entered into his lonely musings; for he read more on earth's fair volume than “philosophy has ever dreamed of.” To the “pure in heart,” the glad melody of Nature's voice always speaks of heaven; and her beaming face reflects much of truth, as well as poetry, on the quiet stream of thought. There is no place where her silent eloquence comes upon the soul so much like celestial music, felt, but not heard, as from the crystal depths of placid Lake George. There is, as it were, a holiness attached to it, heightened by the recollection that for years a mighty, but declining, priesthood, resorted to this baptismal font of the wilderness, to trace their emblem of mysterious faith on the pure brow of infancy; and we feel, as we gaze upon it, that “Lake of the Holy Sacrament” was a fitting name for waters so lucid and so tranquil. Here, at rising and setting sun, might the Recluse be seen, guiding his boat among the numerous Emerald Isles, and dipping his oar almost fearfully, as if he loved not to disturb the sleeping beauty of the scene; and, hour after hour, the light skiff was moored at Diamond Isle, while its wayward owner skipped pebbles in the stream, or searched for the far-famed crystals concealed among the clefts. There was one poor hut upon the island, but Vanderlyn had never entered it. His servant told him that the old crone who resided there, for the purpose of selling diamonds to travellers, was noted for her asperity of temper; and the fastidious refinement of the young artist, always recoiling from everything discordant, induced him to avoid this dwelling with more than ordinary caution. The first time he unconsciously approached nearer than usual, he was warned of it by the sharpest voice he ever heard. As he turned his head, he saw that the old woman was scolding a delicate-looking boy, who was endeavouring to draw a small boat to the place her finger indicated. Vanderlyn, disgusted at the contest, was about to retire abruptly, when a reply came upon his ear in tones so soft and undulating, that it seemed more like aerial music than any human voice. The speaker was a young girl, whose dress, 6A plain and coarse as it was, betrayed much of that simple gentility, which often appears instinctive in woman. Her face was of uncommon and very peculiar beauty. A profusion of light brown hair drooping about her neck, and the deep fringe which veiled her large blue eyes, gave the upper part of her face an expression of pathetic, almost of melancholy, loveliness; but her fair dimpled cheek, and her laughing lip, rising at one corner in most captivating archness, seemed like sunshine bursting beneath a summer cloud, and rapidly chasing away its shadow. Her figure, though slender and graceful, possessed the full round outline of perfect health. Had it been embodied in statuary, one would have imagined the sculptor had half finished a Psyche, when Hebe came bounding along his path, and fascinated him from his purpose. Vanderlyn had always shunned the society of women; but his fancy, cultivated as it was to excess, had conjured up many a romantic vision of love and beauty. Years of total seclusion would probably have rendered a less enthusiastic temperament than his susceptible of sudden passion; therefore, though timidity induced him to retire hastily, it is not surprising that the fair being, so unexpectedly seen, should seem to more than realize his youthful dreams. As he watched the boat which conveyed her from the shore, he soon perceived that the boy had great difficulty in managing it. Experience had made him thoroughly acquainted with the navigation of Lake George; and he knew that it was frequently rendered dangerous by powerful under-currents, the irregularity of which puzzle the ablest pilots. They are probably occasioned by winds rushing from caverns in the earth; for the waters of the lake are often billowy, when not a leaflet is stirring on its shores. Vanderlyn, while waiting for it to subside, had sometimes compared it to the human mind, fretting and foaming from the contradictory influence of its own strong passions, till the calm majesty of Nature could leave no image there; but he did not now waste time in poetic reverie. With sudden impulse, he sprang into his own light skiff; and before the object of his pur 6B suit had reached the middle of the lake, he was at her side, urging her to trust herself to his skilful guidance. The astonished girl blushed exceedingly. She had heard much of the Recluse of the Lake, and she knew that his present graciousness of manner was very extraordinary. However, terror overcame her bashfulness; and she told her little brother, if the boats could be fastened together, she should be much obliged to the stranger gentleman for setting them on shore. The proposal seemed to relieve the boy from much anxiety; and he evinced his gratitude by the most assiduous attention to their conductor. Vanderlyn and his companion were both eager to speak; but embarrassment kept them silent, and gave their interview the appearance of a cold, accidental encounter. However, as the boat was safely drawn up to the margin of the lake, and the young lady thanked him for his prompt assistance, she could not fail to remark the delighted expression of his eye; and the boy was surprised by an earnest invitation to visit the hermitage the ensuing day. Never did impatient childhood watch for to-morrow with such keen anticipation. The lad could scarcely believe that he was indeed invited into that abode of hidden magnificence; and when the remarkable event had in reality happened, he could hardly detail its particulars to his sister, so great was the delirium of his joy and wonder. “Oh, Mary!” exclaimed he, “you don't know, and you can't guess anything about it. I never was in such a place in all my life. He is n't proud; Mr. Vanderlyn isn't proud, as they say he is. You don't know how good he was, and how many questions he asked about you. He gave me the handsomest bird-cage in the whole world, and the handsomest bird in it; and he said that I was such a fine boy he must send me to College. I told him your name was Mary Campbell; and that our father was dead; and that we used to be better off than we are now; and that the woman at Diamond Isle was not our own grandmother, only father's mother-in-law; that we did not live there, but had leave to stay a few weeks till we could get good places out at service.” “But you should not have told him that, George,” interrupted his sister. “And why not, when he asked me every word?” said the boy. Mary Campbell could hardly answer to her own heart, why Arthur Vanderlyn should not be acquainted with her place of residence, as well as her utter poverty. She knew little of a sinful world; but she had read in books that the poor maiden has much to dread from the rich man's love; and when she recalled the deference of the stranger's manner, and the beaming expression of his eye, as he bade her farewell, she shuddered, and even wept, that things so pleasant to memory should be so dangerous. Could she have looked into Vanderlyn's heart, her fears would have vanished. His love was indeed wild and vehement, but it was guileless as infant thought. It was a poet's dream, never to be realized by imperfect humanity; but it originated in pure and honourable feeling, and might easily be changed to something better and more permanent than the illusive delights of an overheated imagination. From the moment Mr. Vanderlyn heard George Campbell's story, he resolved to educate both him and his sister for that higher grade of society, which beauty and talent so well fitted them to adorn. After two days' reflection upon the subject, he visited Diamond Isle for the purpose of making his intentions known. His repeated summons at the door of the hut, were answered by the old woman, who, showing a face squalid as disease and poverty could make it, shrilly demanded his business. “Is Miss Campbell here?” inquired her shrinking visiter. “Yes,” was the laconic reply. “May I see her?” “No, that you mayn't, sir,” answered the beldame fiercely; and, adding a torrent of abuse, which we forbear to repeat, she shut and fastened the door with all possible violence. Her loathsome appearance, and the angry coarseness of her language, were a powerful antidote to the romance of benevolence and love; and for several days Vanderyn cherished the idea that one connected with such a woman must be tinged with her vulgarity as well as ignorance. Nursed in the lap of luxury, the poet made no allowance for the corroding influence of poverty; and innocent of all wicked intentions, he could not believe the grandmother's harshness originated in kind and judicious watchfulness; but the more reluctant he felt again to encounter the virago of the island, the more his curiosity increased with regard to the pretty stranger. He was revolving these thoughts in his mind late one summer's afternoon, when he saw Mary and her brother passing swiftly by, as if they wished to reach home before the twilight closed. He instantly joined them, and urged them to walk in to look at the birds and flowers. The girl's modest “No, I thank you,” was uttered in a tone so mild, he could not think it a very firm refusal; but when he repeated his request, she replied, with something of indignant decision, “No, I thank you, sir. It is quite time we were at Diamond Isle.” The Recluse perceived he was distrusted, and his cheek glowed with honest indignation at the thought; but he bowed low, as he added, “Pardon the improper request; and allow me to make some slight atonement for my rashness.” He darted into the house, and soon returned with a large, beautiful boquet. George cast back “many a lingering look;” but Mary had walked on so fast, that it was difficult to overtake her. She was, however, evidently pleased with the respectful manner in which the flowers were offered; and, before they proceeded far, she even ventured to repeat the fine accounts her brother had given. “Yes,” exclaimed the light-hearted boy, “it was every word true. My cage is the handsomest in the whole world, and has the handsomest bird in it; and Mr. Vanderlyn's house is the handsomest in the whole world, and—” “What a pity,” interrupted the smiling Recluse, “that my handsome cage has not the handsomest bird in the whole world in it.” “You could never find a prettier bird than mine at Diamond Isle,” replied the artless boy. “I believe it,” rejoined his friend; and he looked and spoke so significantly, that Mary's cheek burned with blushes, while honest George in vain perplexed his mind with conjectures whether Mr. Vanderlyn wished to have his bird back again. When they reached the lake, the Recluse made a motion to accompany them; but Miss Campbell said, with evident embarrassment, “I had rather you would not go with us. Indeed I had much rather you would not.” The shade of vexation and disappointment, which passed over his speaking countenance, troubled the gentle girl; and she turned back to add, with the most bewitching artlessness, “I did not mean that I had rather not have you go. It would be very pleasant indeed to me; but—but—indeed, you had better go back, Mr. Vanderlyn.” “I will return to please you, sweet girl,” exclaimed the delighted lover. “Farewell, till you hear from me again.” “She is not tinged with vulgarity,” thought he, as he retraced his steps homeward. “She has delicacy a thousand times more refined their artificial dignity can ever imitate.” Under the influence of recent excitement, he wrote to offer her his hand, his heart, and his fortune. In his letter, he proposed adopting her brother; begged leave to defray the expenses of one year's education for herself; and voluntarily promised to make no attempt to see her during that time, if it were unpleasant to her. Such delicacy and generosity might well have won the proudest and coldest heart; but the desolate and affectionate Mary Campbell was entirely overpowered by it; and, in the enthusiasm of her gratitude, she thought it honour and happiness enough for her to be Arthur Vanderlyn's slave, to watch his motions, and obey his every signal. George wondered at the emotion his sister evinced, and when he was told the letter was from Mr. Vanderlyn, his first sorrowful idea was that the bird must be returned; but, when he was made to comprehend that his new friend had offered to educate him, and marry his sister, he could not control his feelings. After kissing Mary a hundred times, and crying and laughing alternately, he rushed out of the house, and, before his absence was noticed, he was in his benefactor's dwelling. The eloquent speech he had prepared to say, forsook him the moment the Recluse met him with one of his winning smiles. He burst into tears, and exclaimed, “You are too good, sir, indeed you are too good; and we all love you so much!” “Then you and Mary will go to school, for my sake?” inquired the visionary. “Oh, it is such a blessing to go!” rejoined the poor boy; “and then if it was'nt, we would do any thing and every thing for you. I wish you could have seen Mary cry over your letter, and heard how often she said that you were the best man in the whole world.” Though the poet's life had been more like “a fairy dream,” than usually falls to the lot of mortals, he had never known true happiness before. Many and valuable are the boasted delights of intellect and taste, but one moment of the heart's bliss is worth them all. So at least thought Arthur Vanderlyn, when a simple, affectionate letter from Mary, thanked him for his goodness, and expressed her entire confidence in his integrity. The brother and sister were both placed at excellent schools; and though Arthur was for a season separated from the object so suddenly become necessary to his existence, yet her frequent unstudied letters, showed that he was beloved with that mingled reverence and self-devotion so dear to the heart of man. In the mean time a cloud, which the young enthusiast had not foreseen, was gradually spreading over his sunshine of prosperity and joy. Like Shenstone, he had surrounded himself with luxurious elegance, to which his funds were inadequate. Strange as it may seem, for one educated in America, he had an eye and a soul for all the beauties of statues, pictures, and exotics, without the habit of counting their cost. The result was, his fifteen thousand were gone, twice over, before he was aware of it. His creditors were impatient; six years must still elapse before he received another portion of his wealth; his trustees warned him against borrowing the forbidden sum; and no resource remained, but the sale of his beautiful cottage. Unused as the Recluse was to all the rankling cares of life, this alternative went like a dagger to his sensitive heart. However, he resolved to support Mary and George at all events, even if he were compelled to personal exertion. Accordingly, a day was appointed, and the retreat, with all its elegant appendages, was sold at public auction. Much curiosity was excited, and crowds assembled to witness the sale. A tall, dignified, middle-aged gentleman, appeared to take an extraordinary interest in all that was passing. He asked innumerable questions concerning the character and habits of Vanderlyn; doubled what was last offered for any article, however extravagant the price; and left the spot undisputed master of the whole establishment. In this way, a much larger sum was obtained than his creditors had expected; and, after every debt was honourably discharged, the Recluse found that rigid economy would enable him still to support himself and the orphans. His first impulse was to thank the generous unknown; but he had much of that unbending pride, too often the fault of genius, and he could not endure the idea that he owed his present security to the compassion of a stranger. An honest spirit of independence was stirred within him, and for the first time in his life he thought of the productions of his pencil as a means of future support. Among other unfinished views, he had a favorite one, which represented Mary Campbell as he had first seen her stepping into the boat at Diamond Isle. He had ceased to visit that island, together with many a beloved haunt, during his recent distress; but he now resolved to take his canvass to the picturesque spot where he had first sketched its outlines. As he approached the margin of the lake, and saw his boat pushing off from the shore, the painful recollection that it was no longer his own, crowded upon him. He made a signal to the bargeman, which was instantly obeyed; and in the embarrassment of offering money for a passage to Diamond Isle, he did not at first notice that the stately unknown was already a passenger. The haughty Recluse would gladly have retreated; but the gentleman ordered the boat to be drawn up for his accommodation, and with the most friendly politeness urged him to enter. “I am a stranger here, Mr. Vanderlyn,” said he; “and I hear that you have an artist's eye and a poet's tongue. I should really like to share this romantic prospect with you.” He spoke with a slightly foreign accent; and his manner was so fascinating, that Vanderlyn could not decline the invitation. It was a clear, bright, autumnal day. The lake shone beneath the sinking sun like liquid amber; the little green islands seemed to smile at their own shadows; the distant mountains threw an almost imperceptible outline on the cloudless sky; and the rugged peaks which surrounded the lake, looked down upon it in stern and lofty majesty. Thus inclosed, the fair sheet of water, so pellucid and motionless, looked like a lovely babe sleeping at the feet of steel-clad warriors, enjoying its dream of peace, all unconscious of their frowns. The gentlemen had not long admired the beautiful sublimity of the scene, when a cloud of dingy white was observed gathering around the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain. At first, it was thin and shadowy, as the vapour which enveloped Samuel when he rose at the summons of the sorceress; but it gradually accumulated, like the soiled plumes of a regiment rushing from the battle-field in confusion and dismay. “Is that an omen of an approaching thunder shower?” inquired the stranger. “It forbodes a sudden and a dreadful one,” replied Vanderlyn, speaking low, and keeping his eye fixed upon the mountain. The bargeman rowed with almost supernatural strength; and the quick, convulsive heavings of his breath had a fearful sound amid the stillness of the coming storm. Long before they could reach Diamond Isle, the sky was covered with one deep, black mantle of clouds; the lake was dimpled by the falling rain, and illumined with forked lightning; and the thunder rolled from mountain to mountain, ever and anon bursting out in echoing peals, as if the spirits of the air shouted their far-off warnings to each other 7 The scene was too terrific in its majesty for even the poet to enjoy; for an instinctive dread of thunder was one of his peculiarities. “Row faster, bargeman, and avoid the current,” were the only words he uttered; but his eye changed its wonted flash of inspiration for the intense light of fear. The boat cut the black waves rapidly, and, amid the uproar of the elements, they landed in safety. Without waiting for their hasty summons to be answered, Vanderlyn entered the wretched hut of Mrs. Campbell. The old woman, crouching in the corner, seemed to rejoice at the sight of a human being. “I have lived here twenty long years,” said she; “but never have I seen a storm like this.” Few words were spoken by the gentlemen, as they watched the clouds heavily and reluctantly dispersing. Nearly an hour elapsed, before a speck of clear blue sky looked forth, like a seraph stilling the tempest; but the sun at length shone out in its glory, making the grass glitter with transient pearls, and showing every spider's web studded with diamonds, fit for the regalia of a fairy queen. The light entered a small window, and shone obliquely upon an embroidered genealogical tree, which immediately attracted the stranger's attention. Fixing his eye upon it for an instant, he exclaimed, “James Mac Ferguson! was he a relation of your's, ma'am?” “He was father to my husband's first wife,” answered the woman. “Has he any heirs living?” “Yes, there are two great grandchildren, George and Mary Campbell; but it is precious little they'll be heir to, I guess.” “George and Mary Campbell,” repeated the stranger, as if talking to himself. “Did I not hear—” He paused, and looked inquiringly at Vanderlyn; who, blushing slightly, replied, “If you have heard that I am educating the young lady, and intend to marry her, you have heard the truth.” The unknown glanced his eye round the miserable dwelling. A frown flitted over his brow for an instant; but it passed away, as he added, half audibly, “Well, she is beautiful and virtuous, I am told. How can you support her, young man?” continued he, aloud. Recent circumstances rushed at once upon 7A the mind of the Recluse. His blood boiled with indignation at the unfeeling question; and he answered haughtily, “By the exertion of my talents, sir. My mind is my kingdom.” “It is nobly said,” rejoined the stranger. “When romance leads us to be useless, it is not without sin. Have you any papers belonging to James Mac Ferguson?” continued he, turning toward Mrs. Campbell, “There are some writings in that case-of-drawers,” she replied, “which my old man would never have burned.” “Will you trust Mr. Vanderlyn and myself to look at them?” “Folks that know Mr Vanderlyn, trust him with any thing,” rejoined the old woman. “I would not trust him when he was rich, but I will now.” The young man looked gratefully at her; for he loved to remember what had softened her stern heart towards him. The papers were produced with alacrity; and, on opening the third roll, the unknown exclaimed, “I have found it at last!” After examining it carefully, he explained to Arthur and Mrs. Campbell that it was the grant of a large tract of land in Missouri, to James Mac Ferguson, for services rendered the United States during the revolutionary war; that a lead-mine of immense value had been discovered in this tract; and that he had come to New-York with forty thousand dollars, prepared for the purchase, provided any heirs could be found. “And I am delighted,” continued he, “to find those heirs are George and Mary Campbell.” “I am glad, too, for their sakes,” rejoined the Recluse. “I am not the rich man now that I was when I first became their friend; and I shall not allow any trifling services I have rendered to interfere with their choosing a wealthier one.” “Oh, shame fall on her, if she should forsake you, after all your goodness,” cried the old woman. “Arthur Vanderlyn, thou art a noble creature!” said the stranger, warmly pressing his hand, and fixing his admiring eye upon him. “But,” added he, with an arch smile, “you are not fit for the world you live in. Suppose, instead of taking it for granted that Mary Campbell is going to cast off a disinterested 5B lover, merely because she is mistress of twenty thousand dollars, you should make a little more inquiry into the value of this property?” “You told me it was worth forty thousand,” replied the Recluse. “If I did, I told you truly,” said the stranger, smiling; “for I came both ready and willing to give eighty thousand for this valuable tract.” The young man looked upon him with unrestrained surprise. Who could it be, that thus lavished gold around him like a successful alchymist! Whoever he was, he continued to speak to the Recluse with more freedom than any other man would have dared; and he was listened to with increasing and even affectionate respect. After a long conversation, the important paper was placed in Arthur's hands, at Mrs. Campbell's request. A letter was immediately written to apprise Mary of her good fortune, and the stranger offered to take it to Miss Campbell in person. Vanderlyn's reserve had been entirely conquered by the gracious nobility of his character and manners; and, when he bade him farewell, the ensuing morning, he expressed an earnest wish that their acquaintance might be renewed. “Perhaps it may, at some future time,” replied the unknown; and he spoke it so emphatically, that his friend could not drive it from his mind, until a letter from Mary, a few hours after, changed the current of his thoughts. She wrote to tell him she had heard of his late misfortunes, and to reproach him for his kindness in concealing them from her. She said she did not ask permission for George and herself to work for him, until his debts were paid; that she had resolved upon it, and would not change her purpose. Arthur almost rejoiced at the distress which had procured him such a proof of her attachment and energy; and his curiosity was doubly excited to know how far unexpected wealth would have power to dazzle her unsophisticated nature. Two days elapsed before he received a reply to the letter he had sent by the stranger. Its contents convinced him that Mary rejoiced at her change of fortune, only because it gave her the power of evincing gratitude to him. Her first request was, that a comfortable house and good nurse should be immediately provided for her grandmother. She then proceeded to tell him, that the dark-eyed man, who offered to purchase the lead-mine, visited her continually, and urged her to marry his eldest son; who, he said, was handsome, twenty times as rich as Arthur Vanderlyn, even when she first knew him, and besides all that he had seen her, and was desperately in love with her. Mary added, she knew not what to make of all this; but her instructress thought him a needy adventurer, who wished to secure her money; and she really wished Mr. Vanderlyn would come and transact her business with him, without delay. This summons was of course readily obeyed. On his arrival, he was astonished to find how much art had been used to dazzle Mary's ambition, and win her affections from him; and many a time he sighed that hypocrisy should have the power to move so majestically in the disguise of high-minded virtue. For various reasons, it seemed desirable than Vanderlyn should possess a legal right to protect the orphan and her property; and an immediate marriage was decided upon. The unknown could not be found; but eighty thousand dollars were remitted, with a promise to see Miss Campbell in a few days. A new mansion was purchased in the immediate vicinity of New-York; and the morning after a very private wedding, little George accompanied the bride and bridegroom there. Mary was delighted with the tasteful arrangement of every thing around her; but what was Vanderlyn's surprise when he found all his beloved pictures and statues, with many a valuable addition! Even his birds and flowers were there; and the servant joyfully announced that the horses and greyhounds had arrived! Before he had time to allude to the mysterious benefactor, whose conduct had been so strangely contradictory, the door opened, and he appeared. Forgetful of his suspicions, Vanderlyn eagerly stepped forward to meet him. The stranger seized his hand, and looked upon him with unutterable affection, as he said, “God bless you, Arthur: may your romantic loves be happy.” Then sinking his head upon the young man's shoulder, he added, in a troubled voice, “My son, my son!” * * * * * * When the first agitating moments of surprise and happiness were over, Arthur inquired why he had been led to suppose he had no father. “I was obliged to take a long and perilous voyage,” replied the elder Vanderlyn. “I thought it very probable I might never return. I wished you to inherit my fortune; yet I feared to trust you with so large a sum in the heyday of youth and passion. If I died, I believed you would, sooner or later, thank me for the precautions I took; and if I lived, I should have the satisfaction of seeing how my son would bear wealth and freedom. I have seen it, Arthur; and it has been balm to my heart that your life, though a visionary one, has been unstained by anything of sin or shame. But society has its duties, and its pleasures too; and my dear son must no longer live out of a world which needs all the assistance of the good and the gifted. When the long winter evenings come, I will tell you, George, how I landed in Mexico, went to view the lead-mines in Missouri, and finally hastened to New-York, on account of letters I received from my son's trustees; but I shall not tell you how much I have learned to love your sweet sister Mary; nor shall I ask Mrs. Vanderlyn's pardon for urging her to marry my son.” Never was there a happier family than the one now assembled around him who was once called the Recluse of the Lake. Mary's mind gradually expanded under the influence of her husband and father, until she sympathized with the artist and the poet in his most refined and intellectual pleasures. The grandmother was amply provided for, and many a kind indication of remembrance sent her. As for little George, he was in a perfect ecstasy with every thing he saw and heard. His bird-cage was suspended in the breakfast room; but, when he began to sound the praises of its beautiful inmate, Arthur Vanderlyn would affectionately part the hair on the boy's forehead, and answer playfully, “Nay, brother George; now I have the handsomest bird-cage; and the handsomest bird in the whole world in it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPRING. “I have learn'd To look on Nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue.” Wordsworth. Spring bursts upon us in sudden maturity, as if the very seasons had caught the spirit of the age, and childhood had, in everything, become unfashionable. There is a joyousness in the light, and warmth, and warbling of these sunny days; and unlike all other joyousness, it increases with our years. The young prefer autumn; for there is a love of melancholy inherent in our nature; and in youth the heart is so full of gladness, so mantled in its own sunlight, that it looks to the external world for the novelty of sadness. But as we grow older, the piping winds, leafless trees, and marble skies of autumn, are too much in accordance with our own wearied spirit: the old look to Nature for the novelty of gladness. And yet it is painful to compare the springtime of the year with the spring-time of life. The first bird-note that rings through the air, sounds as plaintively as “To return to Lochaber no more;” for when will the springtime of the heart return? When again will fancy pillow herself on the passing cloud, and view heaven and earth mingled in one glorious dream? Angels are around us in the morning of life; and their blessed visions become so distinctly our own, that imagination has the vividness of experience, and earth receives its colouring from heaven. But when the world's chilly touch has wakened us, we seldom dream again. At best, short and fitful are the gleams of hope; and if they dazzle, they do not warm the soul. But it is the very spirit of egotism that makes us sigh at the sight of infancy, and weep at the return of spring. If the glory has departed from us, if the shadows are still lengthening as the sun of our life goes down, blessed be God, the change is in ourselves. Others can still dream as we have dreamed, and perchance be blest enough to die while their own visions are a heaven. Let the seasons pass on in their beauty! We return no more, but they will return. Spring comes, with joy around her like an atmosphere, folding all Nature in her sunny veil, and gladdening the soul of man. Be our autumnal croakings stilled: they ill accord with the season; and we would not, like winter, “chill the lap of May.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BEAUTY. On evening sky, or tinted flower, Or wild bird in his sportive hour, Or the gay insect's tinsel'd wing, Rich as poetic imaging,— Where'er thy radiant form may dwell, Beauty, I love thee passing well! In the blest infant's cherub eye, Beaming with all its native sky, In the folds of its weak embrace, Or the smile on its lovely face; Where'er thy radiant form may dwell, Beauty, I love thee passing well! In ample waves of glossy hair, Floating about the young and fair, As they rejoiced, in breezy play, O'er beings bright as summer's day; Where'er thy radiant form may dwell, Beauty, I love thee passing well! Where sculpture leaves its magic trace Of woman, in her airy grace; Or on the lofty brows of men, Imprints their godlike origin; Where'er thy radiant form may dwell, Beauty, I love thee passing well!

I find no words to tell The power I love so passing well!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HARRIET BRUCE. “To be beloved is all I need, And whom I love I love indeed.” Coleridge. My friend Harriet Bruce was a healthy, tall, English-looking girl; somewhat too large and vigorous for genuine beauty, yet gifted with a speaking expression, and a rich, perpetual colouring, that would have made any other face stylish and attractive. She was no favourite with the gentlemen; but there was an indescribable something about her appearance and manners, which always compelled them to inquire who she was. No person ever talked with her without remembering what she said; and every one criticised what they could not forget. Yet it was not intellect that made her unpopular—had she chosen to affect reckless misanthropy, maudlin sensibility, or any other “wart or stammer,” whereby to distinguish herself, she would have found plenty of admirers and imitators; but in her mind genius was checked by manly philosophy; and she could ill conceal her contempt of those who knew talent only by its most common diseases. The consciousness of mental power, that lighted up her eye with such a burning spark of pride, and the expression of scorn for ever dancing on her lip-corners, ready to embody itself in sarcasm, was unquestionably the true reason why this splendid creature became the Paria of the ball-room. She was a strange sort of Di'Vernon—no, she was not a Di'Vernon, either—and as I now remember her, I cannot think of a single character, living or imaginary, whom she did resemble. She fascinated her enemies, but never pleased her friends. Power! power! and, above all, intellectual power! was the constant dream of her wild ambition. To have been sure of Madame de Stael's reputation, she would have renounced human sympathy, and lived unloving and unbeloved in this wide world of social happiness—there was such 8 magnificence in the idea of sending one's genius abroad, like a spark of electricity, to be active and eternal,—defying education in its form, duration, and power! Sometimes I talked of love, and reminded her how Madame de Stael herself had become its reluctant victim. On this subject she often philosophized, and always laughed. “Who,” said she, scornfully, “who that has felt the gush and the thrill attendant upon fame, would be foolish enough to exchange dominion over many for the despotism of one?” Thus Harriet Bruce reasoned, and thus she actually thought—but I knew her better than she knew herself. Her affections were as rich and overflowing as her mental energies; and her craving for human sympathy was in direct proportion to that intense love of beauty, which, in her, amounted to an intellectual passion. That she would love exclusively and extravagantly, I had no doubt; and my penetration soon singled out an object. At a large party, I first saw her with George Macdonough—the son of a rich southerner, first in his class, and in the full flush of manly beauty. I knew by the carriage of his neck that he was a Virginian,—and the hauteur with which he received adulation, attracted my attention, as the pawing of a high-mettled horse would have done. His conversation with Harriet seemed at first to be of a sober and learned cast; but on her part it soon became petulant. Now and then I heard some remark which seemed to relate to a transmigration of souls, and a continual rise in intellectual existence. “Oh,” exclaimed Harriet, “how that idea savours of New-England house-keeping!—How can a Virginian patronize a theory so economical?” At that moment, a very lovely girl entered the room; and the young man did not answer Miss Bruce's question. “Ah, there is the beautiful Baltimorean,” said he—“she whom I told you reminded me of that fine engraving of yours, `La belle Suisse.”' She is beautiful,” said Harriet, with unaffected warmth. “Her full dark eyes are magnificent—what a pity it is they are not lighted from within; that expression alone is wanting to fill the measure of her glory!” The 8A remark was made to an inattentive listener; for Macdonough's whole interest was absorbed by the new-comer. A slight shade passed over Harriet's face,—but it was too transient to define the emotion in which it originated; and she smiled, as she said, “You had best go and talk with you powerful beauty—the body should be where the spirit is.” “That reproach is too severe,” replied the Virginian. “I meant no reproach,” she answered; “I have observed that beauty is your idol, and I wish you to worship it.” “I did not think Miss Bruce had observed my character sufficiently to form any conclusion with regard to my taste.” The pride of the proudest girl in christendom was roused—and there was something indescribably provoking in her manner, as she answered, “I assure you, I think you quite a specimen, in your way. `Society is such a bag of polished marbles,' that any thing odd is as valuable a study as the specimens of quartz Mr. Symmes may bring us. Your modesty has led you into a mistake; I have really taken the trouble to observe you.” “Truly, Miss Bruce, you are the most singular girl I ever met,” said the offended southerner; “you never did, said, or thought any thing like another person.” “When a compliment is doubtful, Chesterfield says one should always take it; therefore I am obliged to you, Mr. Macdonough,” replied Harriet. And so saying, she turned abruptly from him, and directed her attention to me. During the remainder of the evening, I saw no indications of a reconciliation. Harriet danced but once—Macdonough and La belle Suisse were near her in the set; and they met frequently. The extreme nonchalance with which she now and then exchanged some casual remark, led me to suspect that he had obtained more power over her extraordinary mind than any other individual had ever possessed; but Harriet was no trifler, and I did not venture to prophesy. Time passed on, and with it nearly passed the remembrance of this skirmish of words, and the thoughts thereby suggested. My unmanageable friend seldom alluded to the 8B fascinating acquaintance she had formed; and when she did, it was done naturally and briefly. Soon after this, I was obliged to be absent for several months. I did not return until two days before commencement at —college; and Harriet's first exclamation was, “You must go to Mr. Macdonough's room—he is to have the first part; and his friends expect every thing from him!” “But I thought you considered commencement days very stupid things,” said I; “So I do; you know I always said life itself was a very stupid thing. There is no originality above ground: every thing that is true is dull, and every thing new is false and superficial. But there is no use in quarrelling with the world —it is a pretty good world, after all. You must go to hear Mr. Macdonough's opinion of it: I am sure he will express it eloquently.” Then you are on good terms, now?” said I. She blushed painfully—excessively,—but soon recovered self-command enough to reply, “I always thought highly of him.” I do not know whether my looks expressed the warning voice my heart was yearning to utter; but I am sure the tone of my assent was reluctant and melancholy. George Macdonough appeared most brilliantly on that memorable day! Graceful and dignified, handsome and talented, he sent a thrill to all hearts, alive to the grandeur of thought, or the beauty of language. During this scene of triumph, I watched the countenance of Harriet Bruce with the keenest interest; and never before did I see a human face through which the soul beamed with such intensity. Genius, and pride, and joy, and love were there! I then thought she was intellectually beautiful, beyond anything I had ever seen. Poor Harriet! It was the brightest spot in her life, and I love to remember it. Macdonough's room was crowded; and the compliments he received were intoxicating; but in the midst of it all, I imagined I could see the sparkle of his eyes melt into softness, when he met a glance from Harriet. Her looks betrayed nothing to my anxious observation; but once I took notice she called him “George,” and suddenly corrected herself with an air of extraordinary confusion. Had my friend indulged in habits of girlish trifling, I should no doubt have playfully alluded to this circumstance; but there was something in her character and manners which forbade such officiousness. I watched her with the anxiety of sincere friendship. I knew when she once selected an object of pursuit, her whole soul was concentrated; and I could not believe that the proud Virginian, with all his high hopes, and his love of dazzling beauty, would ever marry her. I knew he was a very constant visiter, and I frequently observed lights later than had been usual in Mr. Bruce's quiet habitation; and when he called to bid me farewell, a few weeks after commencement, the deep gloom on his countenance led me to think that the pride and apparent indifference of my intellectual friend might have surprised him into love. Weeks and months passed on, and I seldom heard an allusion to the absent Macdonough. Harriet's character and manners seemed changing for the better. The perpetual effervescence of her spirit in some measure subsided, and the vagaries of her fancy became less various and startling; yet there was ever a chastened cheerfulness of manner, and an unfailing flow of thought. By degrees her seriousness deepened; and, at last, she could not conceal from me that she was unhappy. I attributed it to the illness of her aged father,—for Harriet was motherless; and she cherished her only parent with a double share of love. But when the old man was evidently recovering, and her melancholy still increased, I knew there must be another, and a deeper cause. One day, as I stood by her, watching her progress in a crayon drawing,—around which she had thrown much of her early spirit and freedom, I placed my hand affectionately on her shoulder, and touching her forehead with my lips, said, “You have always told me your thoughts, Harriet—why not tell me what troubles you now?” She contined her task with a quick and nervous movement, and I saw that her eyes were filling with tears. I gently whispered, “is George Macdonough the cause?” She gave one shriek, which sounded as if it made a rent in her very soul, —and then the torrent of her tears poured forth. It was long before I ventured to say to her, “Then it is as I feared? You do love George Macdonough?” She looked in my face with a strange and fixed expression, as she replied, “I ought `to love, and honour, and obey' him; for he is my husband!” I started! “Your husband! how—when— where were you married?” “At Providence. Do you remember when I asked you to go with me to Mr. Macdonough's room, and you said, `So, then, you are on good terms now?'—I had been three weeks a wife!” “And your father— does he know of it?” “Certainly,” she said; “you know I would not deceive him.” “Then why was so much secresy necessary?” “I now think it was not really necessary; at all events, that which needs to be concealed is wrong. But George's parents wished him to marry wealth, and he feared to displease them. He has a moderate fortune of his own, of which he will soon come in possession; when he told my father this circumstance, and added that he feared he should be urged to marry against his inclination, my father, in the blindness of his dotage, consented to our immediate union.” “Then why are you so unhappy?” I inquired; “you have no doubt that your husband will come and claim you?” “Oh, no! The certificate is in my father's hands; and if it were not, a sense of honour would lead him here. But, oh! to have him come coldly and reluctantly! my heart will break! my heart will break!” said she, pressing her hand hard against her forehead, and weeping bitterly. “How could I forget, that they who listen to passion, rather than to reason, must always have a precarious influence on each other?” I tried to console her—she said nothing; but took a package of letters from her desk, and handed them to me. Their contents proved the mournful prediction of her fears too true. At first, George Macdonough wrote with impatient ardour; then his letters were filled with amusing accounts of the parties given to La belle Suisse, whose father had come to reside in their neighbourhood; then he filled his pages with excellent reasons for not visiting her as soon as he intended; and finally, when Harriet bowed down her pride, and entreated him, if he valued her reputation, to come soon— he sent a cold laconic answer, merely stating the time at which he might be expected. Poor Harriet! It was too evident she had thrown away all that made existence joyful. However, I tried to soothe her by the idea that gentleness, patience, and untiring love, might regain the affection on which her happiness must now depend. She loved to listen to such words—they were a balm to her heart. Mr. Macdonough came at the time he had appointed, and publicly announced his marriage. I did not see their meeting; but during the few months he remained at her father's, I observed his manner was uniformly kind, though frequently absent and constrained. An infant daughter formed a new bond of union, and seemed to be the herald of happier days. The young man watched over the little object with the most intense delight; and Harriet's half-subdued character seemed entirely softened, in the doating fondness of a mother, and the meek resignation of a wife, loved, “but not enough beloved;” none would have recognized the proud, ambitious, and sarcastic Harriet Bruce. I must not dwell minutely on particulars, which I observed closely at the time, and which afterward sunk deeply into memory. Young Macdonough departed once more to take possession of his estate, and prepare it for the reception of his wife and child. His farewell was affectionate; and his frequent letters seemed to restore my imprudent friend to something of her former buoyancy of soul. The idea of separation from her father was now her principal source of unhappiness; but that trial was spared her— the imbecility of the affectionate old man daily increased, and, a few days before his son's arrival, death relieved him from loneliness. The young husband came, as he had promised; but his manner was colder, and his looks more stern than formerly, though none could say he failed in the fulfilment of his duty. Harriet never spoke of any change; her manner toward him was obedient, and affectionate; but never fond. Her romantic visions of human perfection, her proud confidence in her own strength, were gone; and, no doubt, she wept bitterly over their mutual rashness. Knowing, as she did, that she was a burthen, taken up merely from a sense of honour, it is not wonderful her very smile had a look of humility and resignation. Their regrets were however kept carefully concealed; whatever might have been their feelings, both seemed resolved on a system of silent endurance. There was something in this course a thousand times more affecting than the most pathetic complaints. I shall never forget the anguish I felt, when I saw Harriet bid farewell to the home of her childhood,—that home where she had ever been an idol and an oracle. The lingering preparation of departure,—the heart-broken expression,—the reluctant step,—the drooping head,—and the desperate resolution with which she at last seized the arm of a husband who loved her not, and who was about to convey her among strangers,— they are all present to me now! Harriet's letter soon spoke of declining health; and before three years had elapsed, she implored me to come to her, if I ever wished to look upon her again in this world of shadows. I immediately obeyed the summons. Things were worse than I had expected. She was evidently very weak; and though she had every thing which wealth could supply, or politeness dictate, the balm of kindness never refreshed her weary and sinking spirit. Mr. Macdonough never spoke harshly—indeed he seldom spoke at all; but the attentions he paid were so obviously from a sense of duty, that they fell like ice-drops on the heart of his suffering wife. I heard no reproaches on either side; but a day seldom passed without some occurrence more or less painful to my friend. Once, when little Louisa jumped into her father's arms, as he entered, and eagerly exclaimed, “Do you love me, papa?” he kissed her with much fondness, and replied, “Yes I do, my child.” —“And mamma, too?” inquired the little creature, with a sort of half entreating tone, so graceful in childhood,—he put her away from him, and answered coldly, “Certainly, my daughter.” I saw a slight convulsion in Harriet's face, and in the motion of her hands; but it soon passed. At another time, when we were searching in his private library for the latest number of the Edinburgh, we discovered on a small open desk the engraving of La belle Suisse, and near it a newspaper giving an account of the marriage of that young Baltimorean, whom George had thought so strongly resembled the picture. The surprise was so sudden, that Harriet lost the balance of feelings she had hitherto so well preserved. She rushed out of the room,—and it was several hours before I was admitted to her bedside. Fortunately for my sensitive friend, this mental struggle was too fierce to be of long continuance. The closing scene of her life drew near; and to her it seemed welcome as sleep to the weary. Sometimes the movements of reluctant nature were visible in the intense look of love she cast upon her child, and the convulsive energy with which she would clasp the little one to her bosom; but otherwise all was stillness and hope. One day, when she had been unusually ill, and we all supposed she was about to die, she pressed my hand feebly, and whispered, “Will you ask George to see me once more?” I immediately repaired to the library, and told Mr. Macdonough the dying request of his wife. At first, he made a motion toward the door,—then, suddenly checking himself, he said, in a determined tone, “I had better not. It will be painful to both. I will wait the event here.” I returned to Harriet; but I had not courage to say her request was refused. She listened eagerly to every sound for awhile; then looking in my face mournfully, she said, “He will not come!” My tears answered her. She looked upward for a moment, with an expression of extreme agony; but she never spoke again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISERIES OF WEALTH. SUGGESTED BY HAZLITT'S “MISERIES OF POVERTY.” It is to have a subscription-paper handed you every hour, and to be called a niggard if you once refuse your name. It is to eat turkey and drink wine at a dearer rate than your neighbours. It is to have every college, infirmary, and asylum, make a run upon the bank of your benevolence, and then rail at the smallness of the dividend. It is to have sectarians contend for the keeping of your conscience, and lawyers struggle for the keeping of your purse. It is to be taxed for more than you are worth, and laughed at when you say so. It is to have addition of dollars, subtraction of comforts, and multiplication of anxieties, end in division among spendthrift heirs. It is to add interest to principal, until you have interest without principle. It is to pay the tailor for all his bad customers, and compensate the tradesman for what he loses by knavery or extravagance. It is never to be allowed to be on easy terms even with a coat or a shoe. It is either to be married for money, or to have a wife always casting up the sum total of the fortune she brought. It is to have your son's steps surrounded by “man-traps,” and your daughter made a target for the selfish and speculating to aim at. It is envy gratis, and friendship bought. It is to have a dyspeptic wife and pale children. 9 It is to purchase a debtor's smile and a knave's flattery. It is to be invited to drink poor wine, that you may give better in return. It is to have your wife wretched because another wears a higher feather, or a brighter diamond. It is to buy green peas for nine shillings, and dislike them because a neighbour gives two dollars. It is to have sons go to College to buy themes of wiser heads, and your daughters' brains turned by the flattery of fools. It is to have your sleep disturbed by dreams of fire, and your peace of mind dependent on the blowing of the wind. It is to have relations wish you a short life and a long will. It is to insure your widow's tears by making her fortune depend upon her widowhood. It is to contract the heart, and stretch the conscience. It is to have greater temptations than others in this world; and to find the entrance to a better more difficult than to the rest of mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9A TO THE FRINGED GENTIAN. Purple flower, pale autumn's child, Blooming in beauty lone and wild— Slowly matured by sun and shower, To reign awhile in fleeting power; Yet bashfully in that brief space Hiding from view thy lovely face, Veiling thy imperial tinge Beneath a modest robe of fringe. When summer-days are long and bright, Thy lovely form ne'er meets the sight; But when October guides the year, And points to seasons cold and drear, It gracefully his path-way strews, And smiles beneath his shiv'ring dews. Thus buds of virtue often bloom The fairest, mid the deepest gloom. Their latent loveliness conceal'd, And not one embryo tint reveal'd; Till left by fortune's sunny beam, To ripen in affliction's gleam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL CONVICT. [It may be thought that the following story conveys a bad moral: but it is actually true; and since vice and folly are sometimes triumphant in this world, and goodness is sometimes depressed, we should learn to look for reward where alone it is always certain to be found; i. e. within our own hearts.] Rose Mac Orne was a rare sample of Scottish beauty. Her eyes deeply blue, as Loch Lomond; glowing cheeks; hair light and glossy, parted over her broad forehead, like folds of flax-coloured satin; features, which a shrewd and active mind had strongly developed; a tall, muscular frame, of stately proportions; and a firm, elastic, rapid tread, which she had acquired in early days, when “Down the rocks she leaped along, Like rivulets in May.” Her youth was unfortunate; for her mother had died during her infancy, and her 9B profligate and selfish father had abandoned her before she reached the dangerous age of fifteen. Many were anxious to take Rose into their service; for she was neat and thrifty as a brownie, and had the obsequious manner of her countrymen, united with their proverbial knowledge of the most direct road to favour and to fortune. Her greatest misfortune was her beauty. Often, after the most unremitting efforts to please, poor Rose was accused of a thousand faults, and dismissed by prudent wives and mothers, lest she should become too dear a servant. Scotch discrimination soon discovered the source of the difficulty, and Scotch ambition resolved to make the most of it. To lovers of her own rank, she was alternately winning and disdainful—determined that none should break her chains, yet dealing out her scorn to each, as their characters would bear. With her superiors, she played a deep and insidious game. Trusting to her own strength of pride, she resisted their arts, while she almost invariably made them the victims of her own. In all this, Rose was actuated by something more than a mere girlish love of flirtation and triumph: she was ambitious, and had formed high hopes of an opulent marriage. Many a Cantab and Oxonian, many a testy bachelor and gouty widower, had got entangled in her toils, and been extricated only by the early interference of proud or prudent relations. At length, notwithstanding her modest manners and apparent artlessness, the intrigues of Rose Mac Orne became as proverbial as her beauty; and she could obtain no service in any family where there was youth to be fascinated, or wealthy old age to be cajoled. Hearing an East-Indiaman was about to sail, with many ladies on board, Rose resolved to seek employment among them; and succeeded in being appointed dressing-maid to an elderly lady, who was going out to Calcutta to reside with an invalid son. India! match-making India! opened glorious prospects to Scotch ambition. Rose took unexampled pains to please her new mistress; and in two days she was a decided favourite. No wonder the gipsey began to be proud of her power; for she never attempted to please without decidedly effecting her purpose. But when was inordinate ambition known to be a safeguard either to talent or to beauty? In two days Rose was to leave England, and her mistress having granted her permission to attend the races, she, as a last act of kindness to one of her earliest and most favoured lovers, consented to accompany him. Rose was very fond of ornaments; and it chanced that her heart was particularly set on a large pearl pin, which her mistress had said she seldom wore, on account of its antique fashion. Rose had more than once signified how very pretty she thought it; and wondered, if she were rich enough to buy pearls, whether they would become her full and snowy neck. She dared not ask for it outright; and she never in her lifetime had thought of taking any thing dishonestly. But vanity, vanity,— that foolish and contemptible passion which has “slain its tens of thousands,” and that, too, among the fairest and the brightest of God's works, prevailed over the better feelings of Rose Mac Orne. She took the envied pin,—wore it to the races,—heard James Mac Lotyre praise it,—told him her new mistress had given it to her,—and then, dreading the discovery of the fact, began to devise schemes for exchanging the bauble. The path of sin is steep, and every step presses us forward with accumulated power. Rose had already committed a second crime to conceal the first; and now the hope of secresy urged her to commit others. She sold the breast-pin, and bought a ring with the money, in hopes the pearl would never be inquired for this side of India. But in this she was mistaken; that very day her lady missed the jewel; and Rose went even deeper in falsehood than was necessary to keep up appearances. I will not follow her through every step of this shameful struggle. It is sufficient to say the theft was discovered; and Rose, instead of sailing for glorious match-making India, was in a few weeks hurried on board a vessel, in which sixty-two other convicts were destined for Botany Bay. This was a painful reverse for one so young, so beautiful, so inordinately ambitious. She looked back upon England with mingled feelings of grief and burning indignation—contempt of herself, and hatred of the laws by which she suffered. And for what had she endured this terrible conflict, which, first and last, had given her more unhappiness than had been crowded into the whole of her previous existence! Why nothing but the foolish vanity of wearing a cast-off pearl! But Rose Mac Orne had a mind elastic and vigorous: it soon rebounded from depression, and began to think of new schemes of conquest. She looked around among her companions—most of them were tall and robust—some of them very handsome women. She counted them, and counted the crew. There were sixty-two convicts, and fifteen men. Before they were half across the Atlantic, Rose Mac Orne had laid a plan, daring enough for the helmeted Joan of Arc in the full tide of her inspiration. She communicated the plan to the women, which they entered into heartily and warmly. Rose might have found lovers enough on board, notwithstanding the strict orders of the officers; but she chose to inveigle but one— and that was to be the Pilot! Glances and tender notes soon passed between them, unperceived by others; for the artful Rose was like a glacier, when the eye of the officers was upon her; and her lover was capable of playing as deep game as she. At length the important hour arrived— every precaution had been taken—all things were in readiness. The vessel stood for the La Plata, to exchange cargoes and take in refreshments. They entered the huge arms of that silvery river, and cut its waters with the arrowy flight of a bird. At length Buenos Ayres lay before them in the distance, with the broad clear moonlight, spread over it like a heavenly robe. The wind died away—and the vessel lay gently moving on the bosom of that majestic river, like a child playing itself into slumber. Midnight came —Rose had an eye like a burning glass—the crisis was at hand—and all looked to her for direction. Her lover, according to promise, had taken his turn to be pilot; and all slept, save him and the convicts. He sat at the helm looking out upon the waters, and listening to the “silent audible.” There was a slight motion of the sails, announced by a low whistle from the pilot. In twenty minutes every man was bound fast and gagged, —the convicts were armed,—and the vessel was in full sweep for the port of Buenos Ayres! There it arrived—a prize to the prisoners! Great noise was made about the vessel seized by women, and brought triumphantly into port. The “Lady Shore” (for that was the vessel's name) was crowded with South Americans. The bravery of the women was loudly applauded; and in three days the richest young Spaniard in the city offered himself to the bold and beautiful Rose Mac Orne. Her promise to the pilot was forgotten. The ambitious Scotchwoman now wears pearls and diamonds in plenty. Of her sister convicts, some retained their early vices, and died miserable vagabonds; others repented and reformed, and became respectable women.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROMANCE. “Unearthly minstrelsy! then only heard When the soul seeks to hear; when all is hushed, And the heart listens!” Coleridge. It is the fashion in this philosophic day to laugh at Romance, and cut all acquaintance with sentiment; but I doubt whether these same philosophers are not making themselves `too wise to be happy.' Wordsworth has called `fancy the mother of deep truth,' and perhaps the time will come when the learned will acknowledge that there is more philosophy in Romance, than their sagacity has dreamed of. Mysterious aspirations after something higher and holier,— the gladness of fancy that comes upon the heart in the stillness of nature,—impatience under the tyranny of earth-born passions,— and the pure and joyous light of truth, reflecting its own innocent brightness on a corrupted and selfish world,—all these belong to the young and the romantic. What does increase of years and knowledge teach us? It teaches us to seem what we are not,—to act as if the world were what we know it is not,—and to be cautious not to alarm the self-love of others, lest our own should be wounded in return. And is this wisdom? No. I do believe the young mind, that has not reasoned itself into scepticism and coldness, stands nearer heaven's own light, and reflects it more perfectly, than the proud ones who laugh at its intuitive perceptions. Do not all the boasted results of human research and human philosophy vary in different ages, climates, situations, and circumstances? Are not all the deep, immutable, and sacred sympathies, that bind mankind in the golden chain of brotherhood, instinctive? Yes, I do believe the influences of a better world are around youthful purity, teaching it a higher and more infallible morality than has ever been taught by worldly experience. Man must wander from the school of Nature before he can need to look for his duties in a code of ethics. The Egyptians had a pleasant fancy with regard to the soul. They thought that the minds of men were once angelic spirits, who, discontented with their heavenly home, had passed its boundary, drank the cup of oblivion suspended half way between heaven and earth, and descended to try their destiny among mortals. Here, reminiscences of what they had left would come before them in glances and visions, startling memory into hope, and waking experience into prophecy. Various philosophers have supposed that our souls have passed, and will yet pass, through infinite modes of existence. It is a theory I love to think upon. There is something beautiful in the idea that we have thus obtained the sudden thoughts, which sometimes flash into life at the touch of association, fresh as if newly created, yet familiar as if they had always slumbered in the soul. How the beautiful things of creation arouse a crowd of fitful fancies in the mind. Is not the restlessness produced by their indistinct loveliness strangely like a child's puzzled remembrance of its early abandoned home? But all this is not to the point. My question is, not how romantic ideas came into the soul,—but whether it be true wisdom to drive them thence? Observation of the world will convince us that it is not wise to expel romantic ideas, but simply to regulate them. All our nicest sympathies, and most delicate perceptions, have a tinge of what the world calls romance. Let earthly passions breathe upon them, or experience touch them with her icy finger, and they flit away like fairies when they hear the tread of a human foot. There are those who laugh at love, imagination, and religion, and sneeringly call them `dreams— all dreams;' but the proudest of them cannot laugh at the lover, the poet, and the devotee, without a smothered sigh that their ærial visitants have gone from him for ever, and the dark mantle of worldly experience fallen so heavily over their remembered glories. It is wise to keep something of romance, though not too much. Our nature is an union of extremes; and it is true philosophy to keep them balanced. To let the imagination sicken with love of ideal beauty, till it pines away into echo, is worse than folly; but to check our affections, and school our ideas, till thought and feeling reject every thing they cannot see, touch, and handle, certainly is not wisdom. Do not send reason to the school of theory, and then bid her give a distinct outline of shadowy fancies,—she will but distort what she cannot comprehend. Do not, by petulance and sensuality, frighten away the tenderness and holy reverence of youthful love—philosophy may teach you a lesson of resignation, or scorn, but your heart is human, and it cannot learn it. Do not reason upon religion till it becomes lifeless; would you murder and dissect the oracle to find whence the voice of God proceeds? Be, then, rational enough for earth; but keep enough of romance to remind us of heaven. We will not live on unsubstantial fairy-ground,—but we will let the beautiful troop visit us without being scared from the scene of their graceful and happy gambols.</field>

Make her a slave; steal from her rosy cheek By needless jealousies; let the last star Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain; Wrong her by petulance, suspicion, all That makes her cup a bitterness—yet give One evidence of love, and earth has not An emblem of devotedness like her's. But, oh! estrange her once, it boots not how By wrong or silence, anything that tells A change has come upon your tenderness— And there is not a high thing out of heaven. Her pride o'ermastereth not.” Willis. Tahmiroo was the daughter of a powerful Sioux chieftain; and she was the only being ever known to turn the relentless old man from a savage purpose. Something of this influence was owing to her infantile beauty; but more to the gentleness of which that beauty was the emblem. Her's was a species 10 of loveliness rare among Indian girls. Her figure had the flexile grace so appropriate to protected and dependant women in refined countries; her ripe pouting lip, and dimpled cheek, wore the pleading air of aggrieved childhood; and her dark eye had such an habitual expression of timidity and fear, that the Young Sioux called her the “Startled Fawn.” I know not whether her father's broad lands, or her own appealing beauty, was the most powerful cause of admiration; but certain it is, Tahmiroo was the unrivalled belle of the Sioux. She was a creature all formed for love. Her down-cast eye, her trembling lip, and her quiet, submissive motion, all spoke its language; yet various young chieftains had in vain sought her affections, and when her father urged her to strengthen his power by an alliance, she answered him only by her tears. This state of things continued until 1765, when a company of French traders came to reside there, for the sake of deriving profit from the fur trade. Among them was Florimond de Rance, a young, indolent Adonis, whom pure ennui had led from Quebec to the Falls of St. Anthony. His fair, round face, and studied foppery of dress, might have done little towards gaining the heart of the gentle Sioux; but there was a deference and courtesy in his manner, which the Indians never pay degraded woman; and Tahmiroo's deep sensibilities were touched by it. A more careful arrangement of her rude dress, and anxiety to speak his language fluently, and a close observance of his European customs, soon betrayed the subtle power which was fast making her its slave. The ready vanity of the Frenchman quickly perceived it. At first he encouraged it with that sort of undefined pleasure which man always feels in awakening strong affection in the hearts of even the most insignificant. Then the idea that, though an Indian, she was a princess, and that her father's extensive lands on the Missouri were daily becoming of more consequence to his ambitious nation, led him to think of marriage with her as a desirable object. His eyes and his manner had said this, long before the old chief began to suspect it; 10A and he allowed the wily Frenchman to twine himself almost as closely around his heart, as he had around the more yielding soul of his darling child. Though exceedingly indolent by nature, Florimond de Rance had acquired skill in many graceful acts, which excited the wonder of the savages. He fenced well enough to foil the most expert antagonist; and in hunting, his rifle was sure to carry death to the game. These accomplishments, and the facility with which his pliant nation conform to the usages of savage life, made him a universal favourite; and, at his request, he was formally adopted as one of the tribe. But conscious as he was of his power, it was long before he dared to ask for the daughter of the haughty chief. When he did make the daring proposition, it was received with a still and terrible wrath, that might well fright him from his purpose. Rage showed itself only in the swelling veins and clenched hand of the old chief. With the boasted coldness and self-possession of an Indian, he answered, “There are Sioux girls enough for the poor pale-faces that come among us. A King's daughter weds the son of a King. Eagles must sleep in an eagle's nest.” In vain Tahmiroo knelt and supplicated. In vain she promised Florimond de Rance would adopt all his enmities and all his friendships; that in hunting, and in war, he would be an invaluable treasure. The chief remained inexorable. Then Tahmiroo no longer joined in the dance, and the old man noticed that her rich voice was silent, when they passed her wigwam. The light of her beauty began to fade, and the bright vermillion current, which mantled under her brown cheek, became sluggish and pale. The languid glance she cast on the morning sun and the bright earth, entered into her father's soul. He could not see his beautiful child thus gradually wasting away. He had long averted his eyes whenever he saw Florimond de Rance; but one day, when he crossed his hunting path, he laid his hand on his shoulder, and pointed to Tahmiroo's dwelling. Not a word was spoken. The proud old man and the blooming lover entered 10B it together. Tahmiroo was seated in the darkest corner of the wigwam, her head leaning on her hand, her basket-work tangled beside her, and a bunch of flowers, the village maidens had brought her, scattered and withering at her feet. The Chief looked upon her with a vehement expression of love, which none but stern countenances can wear. “Tahmiroo,” he said, in a subdued tone, “go to the wigwam of the stranger, that your father may again see you love to look on the rising sun, and the opening flowers.” There was mingled joy and modesty in the upward glance of the “Startled Fawn” of the Sioux; and when Florimond de Rance saw the light of her mild eye, suddenly and timidly veiled by its deeply-fringed lid, he knew that he had lost none of his power. The marriage song was soon heard in the royal wigwam, and the young adventurer became the son of a King. Months and years past on, and found Tahmiroo the same devoted, submissive being. Her husband no longer treated her with the uniform gallantry of a lover. He was not often harsh: but he adopted something of the coldness and indifference of the nation he had joined. Tahmiroo sometimes wept in secret; but so much of fear had lately mingled with her love, that she carefully concealed her grief from him who had occasioned it. When she watched his countenance, with that pleading, innocent look, which had always characterized her beauty, she sometimes would obtain a glance such as he had given her in her former days; and then her heart would leap like a frolicsome lamb, and she would live cheerfully on the remembrance of that smile, through many wearisome days of silence and neglect. Never was woman, in her heart-breaking devotedness, satisfied with such slight testimonials of love, as was this gentle Sioux girl. If Florimond chose to fish, she would herself ply the oar, rather than he should suffer fatigue; and the gaudy canoe her father had given her, might often be seen gliding down the stream, while Tahmiroo dipped her oar in unison with her soft rich voice, and the indolent Frenchman lay sunk in luxurious repose. She had learned his religion; but for herself she never prayed. The cross he had given her was always raised in supplication for him; and if he but looked unkindly on her, she kissed it, and invoked its aid, in agony of soul. She fancied the sound of his native land might be dear to him; and she studied his language with a patience and perseverance to which the savage has seldom been known to submit. She tried to imitate the dresses she had heard him describe; and if he looked with a pleased eye on any ornament she wore, it was always reserved to welcome his return. Yet, for all this lavishness of love, she asked but kind, approving looks, which cost the giver nothing. Alas, for the perverseness of man, in scorning the affection he ceases to doubt! The little pittance of love for which poor Tahmiroo's heart yearned so much, was seldom given. Her soul was a perpetual prey to anxiety and excitement; and the quiet certainty of domestic bliss was never her allotted portion. There were, however, two beings, on whom she could pour forth her whole flood of tenderness, without reproof or disappointment. She had given birth to a son and daughter of uncommon promise. Victoire, the eldest, had her father's beauty, save in the melting dark eye, with its plaintive expression, and the modest drooping of its silken lash. Her cheeks had just enough of the Indian hue to give them a warm, rich colouring; and such was her early maturity, that at thirteen years of age, her tall figure combined the graceful elasticity of youth, with the staid majesty of womanhood. She had sprung up at her father's feet, with the sudden luxuriance of a tropical flower; and her matured loveliness aroused all the dormant tenderness and energy within him. It was with mournful interest he saw her leaping along the chase, with her mother's bounding, sylphlike joy; and he would sigh deeply when he observed her oar rapidly cutting the waters of the Missouri, while her boat flew over the surface of the river like a wild bird in sport—and the gay young creature would wind among the eddies, or dart forward with her hair streaming on the wind, and her lips parted with eagerness. Tahmiroo did not understand the nature of his emotions. She thought, in the simplicity of her heart, that silence and sadness were the natural expressions of a white man's love; but when he turned his restless gaze from his daughter to her, she met an expression which troubled her. Indifference had changed into contempt; and woman's soul, whether in the drawing-room, or in the wilderness, is painfully alive to the sting of scorn. Sometimes her placid nature was disturbed by a strange jealousy of her own child. “I love Victoire only because she is the daughter of Florimond,” thought she; “and why, oh! why, does he not love me for being the mother of Victoire?” It was too evident that de Rance wished his daughter to be estranged from her mother, and her mother's people. With all members of the tribe, out of his own family, he sternly forbade her having any intercourse; and even there he kept her constantly employed in taking dancing lessons from himself, and obtaining various branches of learning from an old Catholic priest, whom he had solicited to reside with him for that purpose. But this kind of life was irksome to the Indian girl, and she was perpetually escaping the vigilance of her father, to try her arrow in the woods, or guide her pretty canoe over the waters. De Rance had long thought it impossible to gratify his ambitious views for his daughter without removing her from the attractions of her savage home; and each day's experience convinced him more and more of the truth of this conclusion. To favour his project, he assumed an affectionate manner towards his wife; for he well knew that one look, or word, of kindness, would at any time win back all her love. When the deep sensibilities of her warm heart were roused, he would ask for leave to sell her lands; and she, in her prodigality of tenderness, would have given him anything, even her own life, for such smiles as he then bestowed. The old chief was dead, and there was no one to check the unfeeling rapacity of the Frenchman. Tracts after tracts of Tahmiroo's valuable land were sold, and the money remitted to Quebec, whither he had the purpose of conveying his children, on pretence of a visit; but in reality with the firm intent of never again beholding his deserted wife. A company of Canadian traders happened to visit the Falls of St. Anthony, just at this juncture; and Florimond de Rance took the opportunity to apprise Tahmiroo of his intention to educate Victoire. The Sioux pleaded with all the earnestness of a mother's eloquence; but she pleaded in vain. Victoire and her father joined the company of traders, on their return to Canada. Tahmiroo knelt, and fervently besought that she might accompany them. She would stay out of sight, she said; they should not be ashamed of her among the great white folks of the east; and if she could but live where she could see them every day, she should die happier. “Ashamed of you! and you the daughter of a Sioux King!” exclaimed Victoire proudly, and with a natural impulse of tenderness, she fell on her mother's neck and wept. “Victoire, 'tis time to depart,” said her father, sternly. The sobbing girl tried to release herself; but she could not. Tahmiroo embraced her with the energy of despair; for, after all her doubts and jealousies, Victoire was the darling child of her bosom— she was so much the image of Florimond when he first said he loved her. “Woman! let her go!” exclaimed de Rance, exasperated by the length of the parting scene. Tahmiroo raised her eyes anxiously to his face, and she saw that his arm was raised to strike her. “I am a poor daughter of the Sioux; oh! why did you marry me?” exclaimed she, in a tone of passionate grief. “For your father's land,” said the Frenchman coldly. This was the drop too much. Poor Tahmiroo, with a piercing shriek, fell on the earth, and hid her face in the grass. She knew not how long she remained there. Her highly-wrought feelings had brought on a dizziness of the brain; and she was conscious only of a sensation of sickness, accompanied by the sound of receding voices. When she recovered, she found herself alone with Louis, her little boy, then about six years old. The child had wandered there after the traders had departed, and having in vain tried to waken his mother, he laid himself down by her side, and slept on his bow and arrows. From that hour Tahmiroo was changed. Her quiet submissive air gave place to a stern and lofty manner; and she, who had always been so gentle, became as bitter and implacable as the most blood-thirsty of her tribe. In little Louis all the strong feelings of her soul were centered; but even her affection for him was characterized by a strange, unwonted fierceness. Her only care seemed to be to make him like his grandfather, and to instil a deadly hatred of white men. The boy learned his lessons well. He was the veriest little savage that ever let fly an arrow. To his mother alone he yielded any thing like submission; and the Sioux were proud to hail the haughty child as their future chieftain. Such was the aspect of things on the shores of the Missouri, when Florimond de Rance came among them, after an absence of three years. He was induced to make this visit, partly from a lingering curiosity to see his boy, and partly from the hope of obtaining more land from the yielding Tahmiroo. He affected much contrition for his past conduct, and promised to return with Victoire, before the year expired. Tahmiroo met him with the most chilling indifference, and listened to him with a vacant look, as if she heard him not. It was only when he spoke to her boy, that he could arouse her from this apparent lethargy. On this subject she was all suspicion. She had a sort of undefined dread that he, too, would be carried away from her; and she watched over him like a she-wolf, when her young is in danger. Her fears were not unfounded; for Florimond de Rance did intend, by demonstrations of fondness, and glowing descriptions of Quebec, to kindle in the mind of his son a desire to accompany him. Tahmiroo thought the hatred of white men, which she had so carefully instilled, would prove a sufficient shield; but many weeks had not elapsed before she saw that Louis was fast yielding himself up to the fascinating power which had enthralled her own youthful spirit. With this discovery came horrible thoughts of vengeance; and more than once she had nearly nerved her soul to murder the father of her son; but she could not. Something in his features still reminded her of the devoted young Frenchman, who had carried her quiver through the woods, and kissed the moccasin he stooped to lace; and she could not kill him. The last cutting blow was soon given to the heart of the Indian Wife. Young Louis, full of boyish curiosity, expressed a wish to go with his father, though he at the same time promised a speedy return. He always had been a stubborn boy; and she felt now as if her worn-out spirit would vainly contend against his wilfulness. With that sort of resigned stupor, which often indicates approaching insanity, she yielded to his request; exacting, however, a promise that he would sail a few miles down the Mississippi with her the day before his departure. The day arrived. Florimond de Rance was at a distance on business. Tahmiroo decked herself in the garments and jewels she had worn on the day of her marriage, and selected the gaudiest wampum belts for the little Louis. “Why do you put these on?” said the boy. “Because Tahmiroo will no more see her son in the land of the Sioux,” said she, mournfully, “and when her father meets her in the spirit-land, he will know the beads he gave her.” She took the wondering boy by the hand, and led him to the water side. There lay the canoe her father had given her when she left him for “the wigwam of the stranger.” It was faded and bruised now, and so were all her hopes. She looked back on the but, where she had spent her brief term of wedded happiness, and its peacefulness seemed a mockery of her misery. And was she—the lone, the wretched, the desperate, and deserted one—was she the “Startled Fawn” of the Sioux, for whom contending Chiefs had asked in vain? The remembrance of all her love and all her wrongs came up before her memory, and death seemed more pleasant to her than the gay dance she once loved so well. But then her eye rested on her boy—and, O God! with what an agony of love! It was the last vehement struggle of a soul all formed for tenderness. “We will go to the Spirit-Land together,” she exclaimed. “He cannot come there to rob me!” She took Louis in her arms, as if he had been a feather, and springing into the boat, she guided it towards the falls of St. Anthony. “Mother, mother! the canoe is going over the rapids!” screamed the frightened child. “My father stands on the waves and beckons!” she said. The boy looked at the horribly fixed expression of her face, and shrieked aloud for help. The boat went over the cataract.— Louis de Rance was seen no more. He sleeps with the “Startled Fawn” of the Sioux, in the waves of the Missisippi! The story is well remembered by the Indians of the present day; and when a mist gathers over the falls, they often say, “Let us not hunt to-day. A storm will certainly come; for Tahmiroo and her son are going over the falls of St. Anthony.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11 THE SPIDER, CATERPILLAR, AND SILK-WORM. “What sort of a weaver is your neighbour, the Silk-Worm?” said a Spider to a Caterpillar. “She is the slowest, dullest creature imaginable,” replied the Caterpillar; “I can weave a web sixty times as quick as she can. But then she has got her name up in the world, while I am constantly the victim of envy and hatred. My productions are destroyed, sometimes rudely and boldly, sometimes with insidious cunning; but her labours are praised all the world over—mankind wreath them with flowers, embroider them with gold, and load them with jewels.” “I sympathize with you deeply,” said the Spider; for I too am the victim of envy and injustice. Look at my web extended across the window-pane? Did the Silk-Worm ever do anything to equal its delicate transparency? Yet in all probability to-morrow's sun will see it swept away by the unfeeling housemaid. Alas, my sister! genius and merit are always pursued by envy.” “Foolish creatures,” exclaimed a gentleman, who overheard their complaints. “You, Mrs. Caterpillar, who boast of your rapid performances, let me ask you, what is their value? Do they not contain the eggs that will hereafter develope themselves, and destroy blossom and fruit?—even as the hasty and selfish writer winds into his pages principles wherewithal to poison the young heart's purity and peace? “As for you, Mrs. Spider, you are hardly worthy of a rebuke. Your transparent web is broken by a dew-drop, as some pretty poetry is marred by the weight of a single idea. Like other framers of flimsy snares, you will catch a few silly little flies, and soon be swept away—the ephemera of an hour. But rail not at productions, which ye cannot understand! How can such as you estimate the labours of the Silk-Worm? Like genius expiring in the intensity of its own fires, she clothes the world in the beauty she dies in creating.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11A LINES, OCCASIONED BY A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT IN THE MIDST OF DISTRACTING EMPLOYMENT. How oft amid perplexing cares, Fancy comes with her sweetest airs, And brightest scenes— Like the midnight serenade, Waking the beauteous maid From earth-born dreams. 'Tis as if the spirits of thought Their fair and fragrant wreaths had brought, From realms above; But on earth too pure to stay, Threw but one bright rose away, To prove their love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“STAND FROM UNDER!” [The following story was told me as one actually related by a sailor. I wrote it, not because I believed it for a moment, but because I supposed it was one of the numerous traditions among sea-faring people; and I thought it a fine specimen of that wild and terrible grandeur of imagination naturally excited by the solitude and dangers of the ocean. I have since learned that the same story, or a similar one, had been previously written for an English periodical; but never having seen that story, I cannot be accused of plagiarism, or imitation.] We were on board a slave-ship, bound to the coast of Africa. I had my misgivings about the business; and I believe others had them too. We had passed the Straits of Gibraltar, and were lying off Barbary, one clear, bright evening, when it came my turn to take the helm. The ship was becalmed, and every thing around was as silent as the day after the deluge. The wide monotony of water, varied only by the glancings of the 11B moon on the crest of the waves, made me think the old fables of Neptune were true; and that Amphitrite and her Naiads were sporting on the surface of the ocean, with diamonds in their hair. Those fancies were followed by thoughts of my wife, my children, and my home; and all were oddly enough jumbled together in a delicious state of approaching slumber. Suddenly I heard, high above my head, a loud, deep, terrible voice, call out, “Stand from under!” I started to my feet—it was the customary signal when any thing was to be thrown from the shrouds, and mechanically I sung out the usual answer, “Let go!” But nothing came—I looked up in the shrouds—there was nothing there. I searched the deck,—and found that I was alone! I tried to think it was a dream,—but that sound, so deep, so stern, so dreadful, rung in my ears, like the bursting of a cannon! In the morning, I told the crew what I had heard. They laughed at me; and were all day long full of their jokes about “Dreaming Tom.” One fellow among them was most unmerciful in his raillery. He was a swarthy, malignant-looking Spaniard; who carried murder in his eye, and curses on his tongue; a daring and lordly man, who boasted of crime, as if it gave him pre-eminence among his fellows. He laughed longest and loudest at my story. “A most uncivil ghost, Tom,” said he; “when such chaps come to see me, I'll make 'em show themselves. I'll not be satisfied without seeing and feeling, as well as hearing.” The sailors all joined with him; and I, ashamed of my alarm, was glad to be silent. The next night, Dick Burton took the helm. Dick had nerves like an ox, and sinews like a whale; it was little he feared, on the earth, or beneath it. The clock struck one—Dick was leaning his head on the helm, as he said, thinking nothing of me, or my story,—when that awful voice again called from the shrouds, “Stand from under!” Dick darted forward like an Indian arrow, which they say goes through and through a buffalo, and wings on its way, as if it had not left death in the rear. It was an instant, or more, before he found presence of mind to call out “Let go!” Again nothing was seen,—nothing heard. Ten nights in succession, at one o'clock, the same unearthly sound rung through the air, making our stoutest sailors quail, as if a bullet-shot had gone through their brains. At last the crew grew pale when it was spoken of; and the worst of us never went to sleep without saying our prayers. For myself, I would have been chained to the oar all my life, to have got out of that vessel. But there we were in the vast solitude of ocean; and this invisible being was with us! No one put a bold face on the matter, but Antonio, the Spaniard. He laughed at our fears, and defied Satan himself to terrify him. However, when it came his turn at the helm, he refused to go. Several times, under the pretence of illness, he was excused from a duty, which all on board dreaded. But at last, the Captain ordered Antonio to receive a round dozen lashes every night, until he should consent to perform his share of the unwelcome office. For awhile this was borne patiently; but at length, he called out, “I may as well die one way as another—Give me over to the ghost!” That night Antonio kept watch on deck. Few of the crew slept; for expectation and alarm had stretched our nerves upon the rack. At one o'clock, the voice called, “Stand from under!” “Let go!” screamed the Spaniard. This was answered by a shriek of laughter—and such laughter!—It seemed as if the fiends answered each other from pole to pole, and the bass was howled in hell! Then came a sudden crash upon the deck, as if our masts and spars had fallen. We all rushed to the spot—and there was a cold, stiff, gigantic corpse. The Spaniard said it was thrown from the shrouds, and when he looked on it he ground his teeth like a madman. “I know him,” exclaimed he; “I stabbed him within an hour's sail of Cuba, and drank his blood for breakfast.” We all stood aghast at the monster. In fearful whispers we asked what should be done with the body. Finally we agreed that the terrible sight must be removed from us, and hidden in the depth of the sea. Four of us attempted to raise it: but human strength was of no avail—we might as well have tugged at Atlas. There it lay, stiff, rigid, heavy, and as immoveable as if it formed a part of the vessel. The Spaniard was furious; “let me lift him,” said he; “I lifted him once, and can do it again. I'll teach him what it is to come and trouble me.” He took the body round the waist, and attempted to move it. Slowly and heavily the corpse raised itself up; its rayless eyes opened; its rigid arms stretched out, and clasped its victim in a close death-grapple—and rolling over to the side of the ship, they tottered an instant over the waters—then with a loud plunge sunk together. Again that laugh,— that wild, shrieking laugh,—was heard on the winds. The sailors bowed their heads, and put up their hands to shut out the appalling sound. * * * * * * I took the helm more than once after, but we never again heard in the shrouds that thundering sound, “Stand from under.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ADVENTURES OF A RAIN DROP. When I was first aware of existence, I found myself floating in the clouds, among millions of companions. I was weak and languid, and had indeed fainted entirely away, when a breeze from the north was kind enough to fan me, as it swept along toward the equator. The moment my strength was renewed, I felt an irresistible desire to travel. Thousands of neighbours were eager to join me; and our numerous caravan passed rapidly through immense deserts of air, and landed in the garden of Eden. I fell on a white rose bush, which Adam was twining around the arbour where Eve was sitting; while she thanked him with her smiles, and shook my companions from the clusters of grapes she had plucked for him. I shall never forget the sounds she uttered! Mankind must have lost the knowledge of them now, for I never hear such tones; though, in a few instances, where childhood has been gifted with a rich, melodious voice, and I have heard it poured forth in careless happiness, it has seemed to me like the language of Paradise. As it was a cloudy day, and the sun did not appear, I slipped from a rose leaf to the bottom of a superb arum, and went quietly to sleep. When I awoke, the sun was bright in the heavens, and birds were singing, and insects buzzing joyfully. A saucy humming bird was looking down upon me, thinking, no doubt, that he would drink me up; but a nightingale and scarlet lory both chanced to alight near him, and the flower was weighed down, so that I fell to the ground. Immediately, I felt myself drawn up, as if very small cords were fastened to me. It was the power of the sun, which forced me higher and higher, till I found myself in the clouds, in the same weak, misty state as before. Here I floated about, until a cold wind drove me into the Danube. The moment I entered this river, I was pushed forward by such a crowd of water drops, that, before I knew whither I was bound, I found myself at the bottom of the Black Sea. An oyster soon drew me into his shell, where I tumbled over a pearl, large and beautiful enough to grace the snowy neck of Eve. I was well pleased with my situation, and should have remained a long time, had it been in my power; but an enormous whale came into our vicinity, and the poor oysters were rolled down his throat, with a mighty company of waves. I escaped from my pearl prison, and the next day the great fish threw me from his nostrils, in a cataract of foam. Many were the rivers, seas, and lakes, I visited. Sometimes I rode through the Pacific, on a dolphin's back; and, at others, I slept sweetly under the shade of fan coral, in the Persian Gulf. One week, I was a dew drop on the roses of Cashmere; and another, I moistened the stinted moss on cold Norwegian rocks. Years passed away before I again reposed on the banks of the Euphrates. When I did, Adam was banished from Eden. Many a time have I clung to the willows, and looked in pity on the godlike exile, as he toiled in the fields, with his children around him; and, when he sought the shade, again and again have I leaped down to cool his feverish brow. Pleasant as I found this benevolent office, I delighted still more to nestle among the pretty, yellow ringlets of the infant Abel, and shine there, like a diamond on the surface of golden waves. Alas! it is anguish to remember how I kissed his silken eyelash, when he lay stretched in death, under the cruel hand of Cain. Time rolled slowly on, and the world grew more wicked. I lived almost entirely in the clouds, or on the flowers; for mankind could offer no couch fit for the repose of innocence, save the babe's sinless lip. At last, excessive vice demanded punishment. The Almighty sent it in the form of rain; and, in forty days, the fair earth was overwhelmed. I was permitted to remain in the foggy atmosphere; and, when the deluge ceased, I found myself arranged, with a multitude of rain drops, before the blazing pavilion of the sun. His seven coloured rays were separated in passing through us, and reflected on the opposite quarter of the heavens. Thus I had the honour to assist in forming the first rainbow ever seen by man. It is now five thousand, eight hundred, and twenty eight years, since I first came into being; and you may well suppose that, were all my adventures detailed, they would fill a ponderous volume. I have traversed the wide world over, and watched its inhabitants through all their infinitude of changes. I have been in tears on the lyre of Sappho, when her love-inspired fingers swept across its strings. In the aromatic bath, I have kissed the transparent cheek of proud Aspasia; and I have twinkled on Plato's pale, intellectual brow, when he dreamed his ethereal philosophy in her magic bower. I remained at the bottom of the cup in which Cleoptara dissolved her costly pearl; and I plunged indignantly from the prow of Antony's vessel, when he retired from the fight, and gave the world for beauty. I have been poured forth within the dazzling shrine of Apollo, and mixed with the rosy libations of Bacchus. The Bramin of Hindostan has worshipped me in the sacred stream of Ganges. With me the Druid has quenched his sacrifice; the Roman pontiff signed the sacred emblem of the cross; and the Levite made clean his hands before he entered within the sanctuary. The princely archbishops of England have taken me from magnificent baptismal fonts; and, in the wild glens of Scotland, the persecuted Covenanter has sprinkled me on many a guiltless head. I have jumped from the banyan tree on the back of a Hindoo god, and glittered on the marble cheeks of deities in Athens. I have trembled on the Turkish crescent; slept on the Russian cross; died on the Chinese pagoda; and awaked between the Persian and the sun he adores. Warm climates have ever been my favourites; for there, I was often in heaven, in a state of melting, delicious languor; and my visitations to earth were ever among the beautiful and the brilliant. For one hundred years I was doomed to reluctant drudgery in the cold regions of the north; during which my soul was sent forth from gipsy kettles, over the Geysers of Iceland, and embodied again to freeze the head of the Kamschatkadale to his bear-skin pillow. I could tell wonders of Captain Parry, and absolutely craze Symmes with my discoveries. I could, if I chose, make known to hardy adventurers, who have risked life and limb to ascertain it, whether or not wild geese summer at the pole; but the giant king of the glaciers has forbidden me to reveal many things, which it is not expedient for the world to know at present. I dare not disobey him, for he once enchained me, in the dreary chambers of an ice mountain, forty long years; and, had not the huge mass been seized with the modern spirit of enterprise, and moved southward, I might never have regained my liberty. The first use I made of freedom was to revisit the scenes I had enjoyed so much, when men were comparatively strangers on earth. I sought repose, after my wearisome journey, in the holy stream of Jordan; but scarcely had the waves given me their welcome embrace, ere the celebrated Chateaubriand conveyed me from thence to France, to perform my part in the august baptism of the infant “king of Rome.” For such an office, I was willing to leave my beloved Palestine; for seldom have I rested on a boy of loftier promise, or more cherub loveliness; but I liked not the service in which the crafty politician employed me a few years after. It shames me to tell that the water sprinkled on the son of Bonaparte, aided to prepare the vile pages of “Le Roi est mort—Vive le Roi!” with which the capricious Frenchman afterward welcomed the tenth Charles of Bourbon. Disgusted with the servile race of courtiers, I hastened to England, in hopes of finding an aristocracy too proud, in their long inherited greatness, to sue for the favour of a never satisfied multitude, or to triumph over them with all the vulgar superciliousness of newly acquired power. Few, very few such I found; for true nobility of soul is rare; but many a glorious exploit was achieved by me in that favoured land of intelligence and freedom. Once, while hovering listlessly in the air, I aided in forming the rainbow which Campbell has immortalized in such splendid verse; and the next day, Wordsworth apostrophized me, as I lay quivering on the edge of his favourite daisy. I moistened some of the pages of Scott, before they were wet with the world's tears; and I trickled from the point of Mrs. Heman's pen, when her eloquent spirit held communion with Tasso. I have evaporated on the burning page of Byron, and sparkled on the spangled lines of Moore. * * * * * * It would take too long a time to detail all the services I rendered the great, the gifted, and the fair, during my residence in the “fast-anchored isle.” Suffice it to say, with all its advantages, I found much to displease me; and I was anxious to visit a new republic, which I had heard of, “beyond the ocean, where the laws are just, and men were happy.” This land, too, has its evils; but I love it better than any spot I have seen in all 12 my wanderings. Niagara has thrown me forth in spray; and, frozen on its rugged cliffs, I have seemed “like a giant's starting tear.” I have streamed from the Indian oar into the mighty river of the West, and slumbered in the cold blue depths of Canadian lakes. I frolicked in the joyous little stream which honest Aunt Deborah Lenox praised so sensibly, and I formed a part of the “Rivulet” which brought back the happy dream of childhood to the soul of Bryant; that soul on whose waveless mirror Nature is ever reflected in a placid smile, all radiant with poetry. But, in good truth, I have had little leisure for recreations like these; for rain drops, as well as every thing else, are pressed into full employment in this land of business. I have laboured hard in mills, manufactories, and distilleries; and died a thousand deaths in pushing forward the swift sailing boats on the Hudson and the Mississippi. A few months since, I rose from the water works of Philadelphia, and soon hovered over the Boston Athenæum. I happened to alight on the head of a poet, who was just quitting the gallery, and was scorched to vapour in an instant. I descended just in time for a Frenchman to mix me with the “eau de miel,” which he was pouring into an elegant cut-glass vial. A fashionable fop, who considered perfume “the sovereign'st thing on earth,” presented me to a celebrated belle. I shall probably die on the corner of her embroidered handkerchief; but for me to die, is only to exist again; of course, my adventures will be as long as the world's history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">12A THE YOUNG WEST-INDIAN. I am one of those wayward characters, whom the philosophic call romantic, and the money-living, a strange, unaccountable being. Left with a small patrimony, which a thrifty man would have increased into affluence, I chose to indulge my ruling inclination, which was to see men and manners in every variety of light and shadow; and after thirty years' experience, I do not blush at my choice. Nothing tends so much to ameliorate personal character as this kind of passing collision with the motley crowd. Our local prejudices are overcome by finding the same great machinery of heart and mind every where in motion; and the pride of human nature bows down, at so frequently seeing the tremendous velocity of excited passion, destroying the equilibrium of the mightiest intellect. The thousand trifling instances of self-denial, which a traveller is called upon to practise, act on his temper like rolling friction, destroying its inequalities, and polishing its surface; and the morbid sensibility which loathes human folly, even in its most harmless forms, gradually loses its annoying power: for it needs but brief experience to prove, that a nerve thrust out at every pore is an uncomfortable armour for this world's conflicts. Many of my acquaintance pity my philosophic enjoyment, and hint that concentrated affections are more productive of intense happiness, than such widely diffused interest possibly can be. Alas! I doubt it not; but their kindness touches a broken and voiceless string. They know not that its melody has departed; for manhood often endures with cheerfulness what it neither conquers nor avows; and if the sun of youthful love, making heaven so bright and earth so verdant, is obscured by a morning cloud, it is surely both wise and virtuous to leave the heart open to the gladdening influence of others' happiness. At least, during all my 12B rambles, I have found a good-natured willingness to please and be pleased, the genuine antidote to all corroding thoughts. The incidents I have met with have been various, and in many cases extraordinary. One so remarkably indicates the finger of an overruling Providence, that I cannot forbear giving it in all its details. It was in the summer of 1808, that I sailed from Cuba, in a merchant-vessel, bound to Boston. I awoke on board early on a bright and sunny morning. The sea sparkled as if dolphins were sporting on its surface; the sails of the Amphitrite filled; and her prow rose above the waves, as if she were a gallant bird eager for her homeward flight; and the fair Spanish island, wreathed with lemon and citron, reposed in the distance, like a beautiful Naiad on her ocean pillow. We had dropped down from the wharf during the night-time, and were waiting the arrival of passengers from the shore. The sun had not risen far above the horizon, when, in answer to a loud and somewhat impatient signal from the captain, a boat pushed off from the island. The oars, struck by a sinewy arm, left a billowy wake behind them, fretting and foaming for awhile, but subsiding into peacefulness as rapidly as the excitements of our early days. The loud strokes sounded nearer and nearer; presently we heard the drops trickle from the oars as they slowly rose from the water, and soon this was interrupted by a harsh, grating sound, as the boat rubbed against our larboard side. A gentleman, with sharp nose and lips closely compressed, ordered a rope-ladder to be lowered for his wife and child. By the united assistance of her husband's arm from below, and mine reaching over the quarter deck, a pale, but very interesting looking woman, ascended the vessel, and was immediately followed by a little girl, apparently four or five years old, whose olive cheek and burning eye betrayed a Spanish origin. The gentleman himself, a few moments after, leaped on deck, and by his rapid and minute inquiries, I soon discovered that he was Mr. Reynolds, a New-England merchant, and chief owner of the Amphitrite. For one roaming about the world to catch the few bright rays wandering up and down its hazy atmosphere, nothing could be more fortunate than the arrival of the lady and her pretty companion. My heart always warmed toward childhood, with feelings as bright and pure as that holy world from whence the stream of tenderness is poured into the human soul; but I had never met with a child so attractive as Angelina. Soul shone through her whole face, and played hide and seek like sunshine on a rapid stream. It seemed as if a mischievous elfin now wielded his sceptre from her eye's diamond throne—now hid himself in the labyrinth of a dimple—and anon, danced in the corner of her laughing lip. The deep brown hue of her cheek, gave a richness and glow to this light of expression, like the setting sun mantling autumnal foliage. Her long black hair, slightly curling, clung round her, like a fairy veil of clouds, and gave to her slender figure that waving outline so essential to beauty. Her voice was, as I had imagined the murmur of oriental fountains, forever joyful and melodious in its gurgling sound; and her vivacity was as untiring as the tiny star-crested bird, feeding on the acacia's honey-drop, and drinking dew from the rose-leaf. If a fish sprang from the water, she would clasp her hands, and bound along the deck, as if her little heart was too full of joy; and when night slowly gathered up the folds of her spangled drapery, and walked through the heavens in her majesty, she would fix her eyes on the distant star with such a look of earnestness and inspiration, that I almost imagined the mysterious fancies of the poet were then streaming in upon her infant mind. I frequently noticed a deep and tender melancholy in Mrs. Reynolds' eye, as she watched the motions of this fascinating little being. The look was like plaintive music—an expression of that quiet, resigned suffering, which the destiny of woman too often stamps upon her countenance; and it never failed to bring the sensitive Angelina to her side, even in her moments of most boisterous glee. A few days after we put out to sea, a bird flew from the direction where I had told her we left her native island, and alighted on the main-mast. Angelina clapped her hands, tossed back her head, and laughed with such a clear, ringing sound of joy, that even the cabin boy smiled with delight. She continued watching the little warbler, until he spread his wings to rise in the pure bright atmosphere, and then, with childish eagerness she shouted, “Little bird! little bird! have you seen brother Orlando?” She sighed when the bird disappeared among the clouds, and turning, encountered one of those exceedingly pathetic glances with which her friend so often regarded her. With sudden impulse she threw her arm around Mrs. Reynolds' waist, and gazed in her face with that touching, indescribable expression of cherub love, by which childhood endeavours to sympathize with sorrows it cannot comprehend. “Kiss me, mamma,” said the little innocent; and perceiving a tear in her friend's eye, she added, still more soothingly, “will you kiss your dear Angelina once, mamma?” Though unable to conjecture the cause of the lady's emotion, I saw plainly that her heart was struggling with something it would fain conceal; and as she rose, apparently with the intention of retiring to her cabin, I respectfully opened the door, and gently detaining Angelina by the hand, I persuaded her to remain on deck with me. Mr. Reynolds, in the mean time, walked to and fro, with the most profound indifference to all that was passing; but as his wife descended the stairs, he followed her with a more stern and lowering look than I had ever seen in his dead-language face. A variety of circumstances, which had occurred since this interesting family came on board, had strongly excited my curiosity, and none more than Mr. Reynolds' cold and severe manner towards the lovely beings who were dependent upon him for kindness and protection. “Could it be possible,” I asked myself, “that the father of the beautiful Angelina was the only one in the ship whose heart did not warm toward her? No; she must be Mrs. Reynolds' daughter, by a former, and more beloved husband.” However, politeness forbade my hinting, directly or indirectly, any of the thousand conjectures which puzzled my brain and distressed my heart. I saw no more of Mrs. Reynolds that day. Towards evening, when Angelina was sent for from below, she very reluctantly bade me good night, and said, “I will tell mamma how good you have been to me, and how many pretty stories you have told me.” “Take her to the cabin,” said Mr. Reynolds, speaking sharply to the domestic—“I think every body does their best to spoil that child.” With as much politeness as I could assume, I observed that such exceeding beauty, united to the artlessness of infancy, was surely enough to excite a strong interest in any heart. “If one might judge of your years by your countenance,” replied he, “it is over late for you to learn that beauty is a curse, both to her who owns it, and to him on whom she confers it.” He said this with much bitterness of manner, and turned from me with a look that forbade all further attempts at conversation. A few days before our arrival in Boston, Angelina came running toward me, as I stood leaning against the binnacle, and thinking of the mysterious conduct of him whom I then supposed to be her father. “See,” said she, “I asked mamma if I might give you this, and she says I may, because you are so very kind to me.” She held up a valuable ring as she spoke. “It has my little picture in it,” added she—and she pressed a spring, by which two golden hands unclasped, and discovered an excellent miniature. I kissed my little favourite, and going up to Mrs. Reynolds, I placed the ring in her hand, and smilingly said, “your little daughter has evinced the warmth of her heart by a present of most extravagant generosity; but the remembrance of the little creature who gave it will be a thousand times dearer to me than the valuable trinket of which her childish thoughtlessness was going to deprive you.” “It was my wish that Angelina should offer you this,” replied Mrs. Reynolds. “I had two done by different artists of almost equal merit, during my stay in Cuba—she is not my child, and you have shown a most uncommon affection for her; beside, she may” —here she looked round timidly, as if dreading the approach of her husband, whom I had left sleeping in the cabin—“beside,” continued she, in a lower tone, “she may need assistance from some kind friend, if my life terminates as speedily as I sometimes think it will.” With all the deference which her singular situation demanded, I offered any services in my power. “Why I recommend her to the protection of a stranger, instead of—of my husband,” replied the lady, “is an avowal which I cannot make with either delicacy or dignity, perhaps; but there is something in your countenance and manner which encourages me to confide in you.” I bowed my thanks, and the lady continued. “Angelina is motherless, and her father was one of my earliest friends. I married Mr. Reynolds in England; and, on account of the languid state of my health and spirits, he two years after carried me to Cuba, and made arrangements for my stay there during a long absence in the East-Indies, which business rendered necessary. I was under the protection of a widowed aunt of my husband, and lived in a very secluded manner. Angelina's nurse came to visit one of my aunt's servants, and brought the child with her. She was then only two years old, but her countenance had nearly as much character as it now has, and instantly brought to my mind a Spanish youth who was educated in England, and in whom my father took much interest. I eagerly inquired her name, and when she lisped out Angelina Gindrat, I for the first time knew that the companion and playmate of my early days was a wealthy planter in the island of Cuba. I had heard of his marriage long before my own took place,”—she paused, and blushed deeply at the inferences which might be drawn from her embarrassment, then added, “but I now for the first time learned that he was united to a warm-hearted West Indian girl, who brought him a fortune almost princely in its revenues. I soon after became acquainted with Angelina's charming mother. For one year we were as sisters; but at the end of that time, one of these violent fevers so common in the Indies, attacked my friend, and deprived me of her in the short period of four days. I saw Mr. Gindrat but seldom after her death; but he confided his daughter to our care; and when my husband sent me word that it was his intention to settle in America, and that I must hold myself in readiness to sail in the Amphritite, he earnestly entreated that I would take his little girl to Boston, and educate her as if she were my own. When this was suggested to Mr. Reynolds, he made no objection, but, on the contrary, seemed pleased with the child, and with the idea that the ample remittances made for her support and education, would enable us to live in rather more style than his income warranted. But I know not how it is,” said she, turning her face from me as she spoke; Mr. Reynolds does not like it, that I have lost my girlish buoyancy of spirit. He attributes it to—may Heaven forgive him for the unjust suspicion which hardens his heart against the little Angelina— I cannot talk on this subject,” continued she, dashing away the tears that crowded to her eyes. “I am going entirely among strangers, and I may die there. Take this ring; should you hear of my death, see that Mr. Gindrat is timely informed of it; and on no account lose sight of the little being for whom you have shown such uncommon affection.” I readily promised to comply with this request. No more conversation passed at the time; but the frankness with which she had trusted to me, warranted me in making every possible inquiry concerning her young charge. In the course of several succeeding conversations, I learned that Mr. Gindrat was in a declining state of health, and that all his immense property would descend to Angelina and her brother Orlando. This brother was a year or two older than his sister, and exceedingly attached to her. He was absent in a distant part of the island when the Amphitrite was ready to sail, and our detention had been occasioned by her father's anxious desire that his children should embrace each other, before a separation which he deemed necessary for his daughter's improvement and future welfare. Nothing important to my story occurred during the voyage. Mr. Reynolds maintained the same cold and rigid manner; Mrs. Reynolds, always modest and dignified in her reserve, seemed involuntarily to look to me for that kindness which her desolate feelings so much required; and Angelina every hour twined herself more closely around my affections. At length Boston appeared in view, arousing in my mind all the thousand endearing associations of home and country. The joy of a returning traveller was, however, tinged with sadness I could not control, for I was soon to part with the fascinating Angelina, and Mrs. Reynolds' words had given me a sort of fearful foreboding of her destiny. I made preparations to depart from the vessel with lingering reluctance. My farewell to the harsh-tempered merchant was briefly said, and civilly answered. Mrs. Reynolds' manner betrayed feelings strongly repressed, and she looked timidly at her husband as she said, “you must let us see you in Franklin street.” Angelina was folding up her waxen doll in many coverings, that it might be safely carried on shore. The moment she heard “good bye,” she threw down her playthings and clasped her arms around my neck as she said, “Are you going away, and wo'nt you come back to see Angelina ever again.” “I hope so, my love,” replied I, fervently kissing her high ingenuous forehead, “but I must go now.” She did not burst into tears, as I had expected, but seating herself, and leaning her head on her little hand, she heaved a deep, but long-drawn sigh. The harp of sorrow utters no note so deeply distressing, so thrillingly pathetic, as the sigh of childhood. Tears and cries are the natural expressions of their vehement feelings, and they speak grief as transient as snow flakes in a sunny sky; but sighs are the language of a heart grown old—they are taught by blighted hope and chilled affection. What has happy childhood to do with sighs! This mute sorrow made Angelina dearer than ever to my heart. I thought then, and I think now, that a merciful Providence filled my soul with such exceeding love for the little stranger, that I might minister to his own wise purposes. 13 During a stay of three months in Boston, I occasionally visited at Mr. Reynolds' house, and frequently witnessed scenes similar to those with which I have already made the reader acquainted. My visits were shorter and less frequent than they would have been in a happier family; for the sorrows of a young and evidently much-abused wife, were dangerous to sympathize with, and impossible to alleviate. At the end of the time I have mentioned, business demanded my presence at the lead-mines in Missouri. I called to bid farewell to my friends in Franklin street, promising to see them the moment I returned. Mr. Reynolds was more kind to my favourite than I had ever before seen him; and Mrs. Reynolds seemed happy in the hope that her artless witchery would eventually overcome the sternness of his nature. Angelina, accustomed to my absence for weeks, regarded my departure as a common occurrence, and abated nothing of her charming vivacity. Never shall I forget how she looked as she stood watching at the window to see my carriage turn from the door. The sunlight was reflected from a crimson curtain on her sweet face, so full of affection that its image was a talisman of comfort for many a long year after. It required no effort to keep the promise I had made. I had scarcely been in Boston one hour after my return, when I found myself opposite Mr. Reynolds' house, watching the windows with throbbing eagerness. The smiling figure I expected to see was not there. I rang the bell impatiently, asked the servant in a hurried tone, “Is Mrs. Reynolds at home,” and pressed forward with an impetuosity which my sense of decorum could not restrain. “Sir,” replied the servant, “she has been dead this fortnight.” “Dead!” I exclaimed. “Yes sir, she is dead.” “And where is Angelina? How is the little West-Indian girl?” “She died two days after. They were both attacked with a malignant fever, and died in the country.” The blow fell upon me with such stunning, stupifying force, thought and feeling seemed suspended. Reeling and dizzy with misery 13A I could not realize, I inquired for Mr. Reynolds. “He is at the compting-room,” replied the domestic; “but walk into the parlour, sir, you are very pale.” He opened the door, and, hardly knowing what I did, I entered. There hung the crimson curtain, just as it had hung when I saw the little face I loved so well, peeping from behind its folds. Then, indeed, memory came upon my heart in a rush of agony. The numbness was taken from my soul, and I felt the full extent of my affliction. I will not describe the remainder of that day. Those who have ever loved strongly, and lost the object of their affections, will imagine, more vividly than words can portray, that terrible void in the human soul, when the earth is a wilderness, and the heavens shrouded in blackness. It was not until several days after, that I could see Mr. Reynolds, talk of their death, and visit their graves. I lingered long on the spot where they told me the suffering wife and the joyful little innocent slept side by side. “It is ever thus,” thought I, “the brightest and fairest buds are soonest removed to the paradise of God. Happy, happy are those who never know the autumn-leaf of feeling, the chill drear atmosphere of a desolated heart.” * * * * * * * * When I lost the object of my early attachment, a few days before the solemn marriage-vow was to connect us forever, for weal or woe, I had found change of scene one of the best restoratives for my wounded and restless spirit; and now that my clinging affections were a second time driven from their strong hold, I resorted to the same means of cure. I visited France and England, and made myself familiar with most of the scenes consecrated by history or tradition. I remained abroad nearly nine years, during which time I saw announced in the public papers the death of Mr. Gindrat, the father of my lamented little friend; and heard several particulars of Mrs. Reynolds' history. The Spanish youth, as she called him, was, as I suspected, her first lover; and he had gained her heart at that enthusiastic period when it clings to a dear object with a strength which 13B bids defiance to the subtle power of interest, or the tempting signal of ambition. When his education was finished, he married a West-Indian heiress. His English playmate heard of his union, and from that time cared little whether her path of life were in sunshine or shadow. She never, even in her inmost thought, reproached Mr. Gindrat. The world excused him from blame because he had made no open declaration, and had, of course, broken no vows; but is a cold, spiritless morality which dictates a creed like this. He who makes his eyes telegraphs of a love he does not utter, and, by a thousand unnecessary attentions, wreaths himself more closely around a heart that cherishes his looks and records his minutest actions, is answerable for the blight and mildew of that heart. Some said this was the view Mr. Gindrat himself took of the subject; and that the tacit compact he had broken, cast a shade of melancholy over his future life. Angelina Lee, for such was Mrs. Reynolds' name, gave no indications of misery which a common observer would have noticed; but she lost her interest in what was around her, and seemed to act the cheerfulness she no longer felt. Her father was anxious to see her married, for a reason more powerful than the world suspected; the irretrievable embarassment of his fortune. Mr. Reynolds, a stern, vindictive, unprincipled, but gallant man, had long been struck with her beauty, and had an eye upon her expected fortune. He offered his hand—her father urged his claims —and partly from a listlessness of spirit which shrunk from contention with her father's will—and partly from that love of homage which exists more or less in every heart, she consented to become his wife. Had his love for her been genuine, all would have been well; for kindness will cure most mental diseases; but he was vexed at her father's loss of property, and put no check upon his harsh, tyrannical nature. The idea that disappointed affection occasioned his wife's ill health, and the unjust suspicion that she knew of her former lover's residence in Cuba, before she expressed a wish to go there, increased this evil to the utmost; and a more cruel and dreadful suspicion with regard to the nature of her affection for Angelina, infuriated his hatred toward the child, although his grasping avarice would not allow him to relinquish the care of one so opulent. I have already told how happily they both escaped from his tyranny; and as nothing connected with the young West-Indian transpired until after my return to America, I must beg the reader to pass over this long period, and allow his imagination to accompany me on one of the first excursions I made in my native land, in the autumn of the year 1817. Several of my friends having heard that there was plenty of game at Weston and Sudbury, proposed to collect a shooting party to ascertain the truth of the report. A mere love of rambling induced me to join them; for Cowper had so early inspired me with a reluctance to take away life, that all the boasted excellencies of Joe Mantons and percussion caps could never tempt me to be a sportsman. I had heard that something in commemoration of one of King Philip's numerous battles was to be found in this neighbourhood; and the love of seeking out all that our infant country dignifies with the name of antiquities, soon led me to desert a scene where I could neither gratify taste nor display skill. My companions humoured my wayward propensities by pointing out the direction of the place, and promising to be altogether independent of me in their homeward arrangements, should my long stay render it necessary. The route they indicated led over fence and wall, brake and brier. I wandered on until I grew weary of hobbling over potato fields, like a boy stumbling through the first pages of Virgil, and climbing slope after slope, like a man condemned to the tread-mill. Seeing a lad in the high road, dragging lazily along after a couple of sleepy oxen, I hastened to overtake him, and inquire where Wadsworth's monument was to be found. “Whir-ho,” shouted the yeoman, in sharp and angular tones, at the same time laying his whip parallel with the eyes of his oxen. “What might you say, sir?” “I asked you to tell me where the monument is.” “I don't remember hearing of any monerment in these parts,” replied the lad, tipping his hat on one side in a very knowing way, and passing his brawny fingers through his stiff red hair, till his skull bore no small resemblance to an enchanted haystack, “but I've read in the prints that they 're going to put up a monerment at Washington that 'll cost uncle Sam a power o' dollars.” “What I was speaking of,” answered I, “is a memorial of Wadsworth and Bruklebank, massacred in King Philip's wars.” “According to my idees,” replied my informer, “a memorial is another guess sort o' thing from a monerment. Dad sent a memorial to uncle Sam, about losing one of his toes in the old war; but it 'ill be long enough afore dad has a monerment, I guess.” “Can you or can you not tell me where the place is?” repeated I, half vexed and half amused with the ignoramus. “That depends a bit upon what place you mean. I guess as how you 're from Boston. Some how or other, they hear of all sorts of things down there.” Seeing I was not likely to gain any information, and shrewdly suspectin the follow had that mischievous love of hoaxing his city brethen, so common in the interior, I passed briskly on, but was soon stopped by a shrill “halloo, mister! if so be there is such a place round here, our schoolmaster can tell you all about it. He's a curous man for larning. If you was to ax him, `can't you tell me where sich a place is?' and he was to say, `no,' he'd mean yes.” “How so?” asked I, “that's no proof of his wisdom.” “But it is though; for you see there's a negative in your question, and if there was a negative in his answer, it would be double you see—and the grammar'd stand him out in saying, that 'are was an affirmative.” Smiling at this parade of scholastic lore, I inquired where the redoubtable pedagogue resided. “Why he boards round, sir, because the town can't afford to pay his board; but he's a curous larnt man—he could tell you the latitude of your tongue, and the longitude of your head, if you axed him.” “Your tongue has pretty great latitude, I think, sir,” replied I. “Not up to the longitude o' my head, I count,” said the buffoon, tipping a wink with that odd mixture of impudence, vulgarity and archness, peculiar to those who style themselves “crank country lads.” What more his wit or his wisdom might have chosen to amuse me with, I know not —for he stopped his conversation, and pointing to a dilapidated farm-house, exclaimed, “there's uncle Joe's house. I guess the master lives there. If he an't at home, maybe uncle Joe can tell you about the monerment.” Then whistling to his oxen to quicken their pace, he, without further ceremony, left me to my adventures. I found all attempts to make myself heard at the front door of the mansion entirely useless; and I continued walking round and round the domains, until half a dozen brick-red milk-pans, a strainer spread over a wooden pail, and a checked apron drying on a plough-handle, gave indications of an inhabitated country. In answer to my knock, I heard a sharp, shrill voice call out, “Go to the door, Joe.” But a laconic “walk!” uttered in tones as deep and gruff as the bass notes of a frog's organ, was the only notice taken of the sharp command. Doubtful as the word was in its import, and ungracious in its utterance, I thought best to understand it in its most hospitable sense. Accordingly raising the wooden latch by a leathern string, somewhat slippery from many a greasy touch, I ventured to explore the interior of the building. It certainly had not the recommendation which plain exteriors frequently have. A pumpkin-shell full of cobbs, surmounted by a pair of broken bellows; one andiron beheaded, and the other sinking down beneath the weight of years; towels which an antiquary might have sworn were stripped from Egyptian mummies, and a floor that could never again be frightened into paleness by mop, or broom—all proclaimed that neatness and comfort were strangers there. When I made known my errand, the old man laid his pipe in the ash-hole, and thrusting his hands into his ragged pockets, to which his idle fingers owed a heavy rent, he said—“The school-master an't to home; but I guess I can go with you—if you'll wait till I've split some wood, and hung on the tea-kettle for my old woman.” The matron, who had wiped her spectacles on a tattered silk handkerchief, and stared at me to her heart's content, here answered in her sharpest tones, “no you won't I can tell you, Joe. You an't a fit man to be out o' the sight o' your chimly, as long as grog's made o' potatoes. When that lazy witch of a Peg comes home from the meadow, she can show the stranger gentleman the way; for she and Master Dudley know all the out-o'-the-way places hereabouts. Wherever she's lagging, I'll be bound he's with her. Well I hope good'll come on't. That's all I've got to say.” While she was speaking, I noticed from the window a young man, bearing a well-filled bag on his shoulder, coming toward the house in earnest conversation with a barefooted, ill-dressed girl. “There's our Peg,” exclaimed the old virago, taking off her spectacles in a desperate hurry:—“It's jest as I knowed 'twould be.” A moment after, the object of her irritation entered, and chained my attention as if by a magic spell. Her ragged straw bonnet had fallen back from her forehead, and through one of its loop-holes a sun-beam darted on the most brilliant eyes I had ever beheld, and gave additional richness to dark cheeks, highly flushed by air and exercise. Her movements had nothing of rustic angularity; on the contrary, there was a gliding gracefulness of manner which her coarse and narrow dress could not entirely fetter. “In truth,” thought I, “this forlorn place seems much unlike a paradise of poverty; but if it were, thou, my pretty damsel, might surely be its angel.” She blushed and smiled as she met my glance of delighted surprise; and at that moment she looked so like Angelina standing beneath the crimson curtain, that I would fain have clasped her to my heart. The delightful dream was interrupted by a sharp reprimand from the old woman, for having been so tardy in filling the bag with cranberries. She concluded by saying—“I guess we shall make a profitable spot o' the work o' taking Master Dudley to board.” I involuntarily glanced toward the young man to whom she alluded. His countenance pleased me exceedingly, though his features were far from handsome. A slight degree of sadness tinged an expression remarkably ingenuous and intellectual, and made his face the sun-dial of the soul, where genius might mark all its changes in alternate sunshine and shadow. With a voice and manner which indicated the respect he had inspired, I asked him to accompany me to the spot consecrated by King Philip's battle. He readily complied with my request, assuring me that it was just beyond the neighbouring meadow. The old man had meekly resumed his pipe, and languidly nodded his head in answer to my parting salutation. The old woman was busily emptying her cranberries, and did not notice that, as we left the house, the eyes of the young people met, and spoke volumes at a glance. Surely the eye is the vocabulary of disembodied spirits; for human sounds have never yet been able to define its rapid comprehensive language. Responding to his thoughts as if they had been uttered, I observed, “that young girl possesses singular beauty.” “Yes,” answered Mr. Dudley, “and talents still more extraordinary. She is but fourteen years old, and has never had advantages superiour to those afforded by my school; yet you would be astonished at her instinctive sense of all that is sublime or beautiful.” There was a dignified enthusiasm in the speaker's manner, which confirmed the favourable impression I had received from his countenance. “This is no place for such minds,” answered I; “pardon me if I ask why you bury your talents here. Why not come forward and join in the honourable competition of intelligent men?” “Poverty, a chain which has kept down many spirits more ambitious than my own, first brought me here,” rejoined he; “and pity for the poor girl you have just seen, induces me to remain.” “In what way can your residence here benefit her,” said I. “I should think it might possibly prove injurious to you both.” “I understand you,” replied he, colouring deeply. “The interest I have taken in her is honourable and disinterested, and precisely such as would have been awakened in any mind, acquainted with her desolate situation and extraordinary gifts. With tears in her eyes, she last winter entreated me to teach her occasionally during the long evenings, that she herself might soon be qualified to instruct. I promised I would. I found in her an uncommon facility in acquiring knowledge; and cost me what it will, I will not leave her till she is able by her own exertions to throw off the yoke of unfeeling tyranny which now bows her to the earth.” “Are not her grand-parents kind to her, then,” inquired I. “They are no relations of her's,” rejoined Dudley. “Their name is Hager, her own is Margaret Williams. She was brought here, when about four years old, by a gentleman who called himself Vinton. He paid her board until she was eight years old; but since that time they have heard nothing from him, and all inquiries for such a man have proved fruitless. Her work has been worth something to them, so they have not turned her adrift upon the world; but the scanty pittance she receives is given grudgingly enough.” “The state of things within doors,” said I, “does not indicate so much energy as you represent Margaret to possess.” “She is the slave, and not the superintendant there,” answered he. “Besides, what is human nature without motives to impel it to exertion? No thanks reward her toil—no smile of approbation shows that her carefulness is noted—but I forget, you are a stranger—and here we are by the side of what is called the monument.” A rude pile of earth and bricks, against which leaned a stone bearing the date of the battle, and the names of Bruklebank, Wadsworth, &amp;c. was all that marked the spot. In my eyes it was more venerable than many a lofty pile I had seen in foreign abbeys. They spoke the idle pageantry of regal folly, or commemorated the mad projects of unprincipled ambition; but this was one of the humble memorials of our forefathers—men of obscure rank, yet born to a lofty destiny— outposts from the vanguard of our youthful 14 nation, yet volunteers who threw themselves across the pit-falls in her dangerous path, and bade the car of liberty crush them in its onward course. At another time, I should have given myself up longer to these heart-stirring recollections; but I was really touched by the details I had just heard, and I plainly saw the feelings of my young companion were wounded by my seeming coldness. After walking a few steps from the monument, in silence, I said, “you must excuse a blunt old bachelor, Mr. Dudley, if he does ask such an abrupt question, as, what do you mean to do with yourself hereafter?” “The only definite purpose I have,” replied the young man, “is to obtain a liberal education, if possible. My course will be guided by the leadings of Providence.” “Why do you not go to West Point?” said I. “Because I have neither friends, nor influence,” rejoined he. “It has been my favourite project, I acknowledge; but alone and unassisted as I am in the world, it would be presumption in me to hope for it.” “I like your looks and your sentiments, young man,” replied I, “and it shall not be my fault if your ambitious wishes are not fulfilled. As for that charming Margaret, who has awakened your pity so much, if you are not afraid to trust her to an old fellow like me, I will support her at the best school in Boston for three succeeding years.” Mr. Dudley looked at me a moment, as if he wished to penetrate my very soul, and said, “if you mean as you say, sir, may heaven bless you for the thought.” “I do mean as I say,” rejoined I. “I am alone in life, with an easy fortune, and I find the bank of benevolence pays me the largest dividend of happiness.” Mr. Dudley seemed to forget my promises concerning West Point, but he talked of what Margaret Williams might be made by education, and thanked me for my purposes towards her, with a fervent gratitude, which renewed my own youthful affections. When we returned to Mr. Hagar's miserable dwelling, we found every thing much as we had left it, excepting that the hearth was neatly washed, and the supper-table spread 14A in quite an orderly manner. Having asked the good dame's leave to share their repast, I began to talk of the subject which had so much interested Mr. Dudley on his walk homeward. When I asked Margaret if she would accompany me to Boston, and go to school there, she looked timidly first at me, and then at Mr. Dudley, and covering her face with both her hands, burst into tears. The old man seemed somewhat moved, and said the poor orphan was welcome to a corner of his house so long as he lived. “Which won't be long, at the rate you've gone on of late years,” rejoined his wife. “Peggy has been a bill of expense to us long enough; and it's a hard case to have her go off as soon as she's good for something.” “I will satisfy you in that respect, good woman,” said I; “we shall not quarrel about the terms, if Margaret will but say she will go with me.” “You are a stranger to us, sir,” resumed the matron; but doubtless you have good reasons for taking such a violent liking to Peggy.” “His stainless reputation is no stranger to me,” said Mr. Dudley, “though I have never seen his person before. The name of* * *is associated with too many generous deeds, not to be known at the remotest corners of Massachusetts.” “Then you think I had better go,” said Margaret. “Most certainly I do,” replied Mr. Dudley. “And will you say yes, now?” said I, affectionately passing my hand over her long black hair, as she stood beside me. The poor orphan sunk kneeling at my feet, and wept in the full gratitude of her heart, till even her stern mistress turned towards the window, to conceal her tears. I raised her up with many assurances of kindness and protection; she continued to weep, till, as I held her hand within mine, her eye glanced upon Angelina's ring. The eager curiosity with which she regarded it, called to my mind, what her height and womanly bearing had well nigh made me forget, that she was but a child—an artless, uncultured child! I touched the spring and revealed the miniature of my little favourite. “Oh, it is very beautiful,” exclaimed she. “You never saw such a ring before, I suppose?” said I. 14B “No—I don't think I ever did,” replied she, speaking in a very slow and hesitating manner. She gazed in the fire very thoughtfully for a moment, then sighing deeply, looked in my face with an expression so like Angelina's, when I first bade her farewell on board the Amphitrite, that I felt determined she should henceforth be my daughter. Once, the wild idea did cross my brain, that she was strangely like my lamented favourite, and that the news of her death might all have been a deception. But I had been at her grave, I had heard the servants talk of the burial, and the nurse describe her last moments; and I smiled that imagination should try to play such wild freaks with me. For various reasons, I deemed it prudent to remain at the farm-house that night, rather than expose myself and my interesting protege to the curiosity, and perchance the jests, of my companions. I knew that my oddity had long since placed me in an easy-chair for life; and that my friends were willing to grant me as much liberty as they did their favourite dogs; allowing me to strike off into as many by-paths as I chose, and return when and how I could. I will not detail the various instances of avarice and hard-heartedness, which were elicited during the bargain I made with Mrs. Hagar. Suffice it to say, the sum I promised to pay her, as an indemnification for Margaret's services, was certainly much larger than I should willingly have given, had not the country maiden so powerfully reminded me of the fascinating little West-Indian. To be brief, I seated Margaret beside me in the stage, the following morning, claiming from Mr. Dudley a promise to visit us in a few weeks. “I will own all my errors first,” said he smiling; “and then if you forgive me, I shall feel proud to avail myself of your invitation. I knew you by report, and I told you Margaret's story, in hopes your quick feelings and ready benevolence might be aroused in her behalf.” “I thank you for the stratagem,” said I, warmly shaking him by the hand. “Unless your own conduct alters my opinion of you, you will find me an active friend.” A few kind words to the tearful Margaret, accompanied by a present of Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd, closed the farewell scene. As for the old people, they showed little emotion, except a vulgar curiosity and wonder at my unaccountable interest in their Peggy. To part from such a home could not be very afflicting to any heart. For a few days Margaret was melancholy, and more than once I found her in tears over the Gentle Shepherd; but she soon became gayer than I had imagined it was in her nature to be. All that Mr. Dudley had said of her genius was more than verified. It seemed as if she were gifted with an additional sense, a sort of spiritual ear, to which every waving flower and bending shrub spoke strange melody. Her progress was so rapid, that Mr. ****'s adopted daughter soon became the wonder of the whole school. Before two years had expired, I received a letter from Mr. Fitzroy, a rich planter in South-Carolina, entreating that Miss Williams might return home with his daughter, who was about to leave school. Margaret's deference and modest affection had made her exceedingly dear to me; but thinking that a visit to the south, under such patronage, and with such a young lady as I knew her friend to be, would be a great advantage to her, I consented that she should visit Carolina for one year. During this time, I frequently received letters from her, always full of deep, poetic fancy, and the most enthusiastic, grateful affection. If the reader finds it difficult to imagine so sudden a change of character, I assure him it was no less wonderful to me than it is to him. There are minds which seem to have an instinctive perception of all that is tasteful and refined; and Margaret's was such. She had, as it were at once, grown a tall, beautiful, graceful girl, and had become the pride of a foolish old heart, that at first clung to her in pity. And where was the poor youth who at first revealed the treasures hidden in her heart and mind? He was at West Point. And when Margaret made her visit to the south, his name stood highest among that celebrated band, which has so happily united the courtliness of the drawing-room with the dignified refinement of intellectual pursuits—like a mighty citadel, around which the woodbine falls in accidental profusion, giving lightness to its outline, without concealing its strength. * * * * * * * The reader is, I suppose, well nigh weary of following me in my rambles, now pausing by the road-side to dissect a thistle, and anon passing over whole fertile gardens without a glance; but thus have I done in life, and thus must he suffer me to do in my story, if he ever wishes to hear its conclusion. A letter from Margaret, dated in the autumn of 1820, informed me that Mr. Fitzroy, his daughter, and herself, were about making a northern tour, and wished very much that I should join them at New-York. I was not certain, at the time, I should be able to do this; but I promised to meet them on their return. About a week after they left the city, I arrived there, and immediately took passage in the steam-boat, on the North River, thinking I should hear of them at West-Point, Lake George, or some other of the places, which I knew they intended to take in their route. The passengers were, as usual, an odd assemblage of all sorts of nations, tribes, and tongues. A half facetious, half fretful, old yankee was complaining bitterly of the noise, and telling the captain he ought to keep padlocks for the eyes in a place like that; a Frenchman was tapping his box with the most graceful air, and annoying every body with his snuff and his voulezvous; an Irishman, in his uncouth national sounds, was most eloquently describing the death of Emmett; and a little Dutch woman with three chubby children, poured forth a continual torrent of words as unmusical as the rattling of a coal-cart over the pavements of a city. Apart from all, sat a handsome, but very dark-complexioned, young man, completely absorbed in the enchanting pages of Ivanhoe. He raised his eye as I stepped on deck, but its long, dark lash fell almost instantly. I took up a newspaper, and glancing over its columns for a time, left the interesting stranger to pursue his delightful occupation in peace. It was long before he closed the volume, and in a silvery, flute-like voice, made some casual remark concerning the beauty of the day. This observation was a very common one; but the words were arranged with such unstudied elegance, and his pronunciation had so much of music about it, that my attention was immediately excited. There is a sort of free-masonry by which intelligent and highly cultivated souls form a rapid knowledge of each other. The conversation soon passed to interesting subjects. A fine head of Cicero, which I noticed on his watch-seal, led to gems, and cameos, and Herculaneum, and the curiously carved ring, said to have been found there. On every topic, his rich, classical mind, poured itself out with the same delightful yet unostentatious enthusiasm. “We are sinning against nature,” said he, smiling, “to be talking of antiquity, when such a scene of imposing grandeur is presented to our view.” My eye followed him as he pointed to the Highlands, which were now before us; `some of the heights swelling in gradual and noble elevation from the bank of the river; others rising from the water in a perpendicular mass, and starting into sharp and pointed bluffs, as if thrown up there by the hand of art. The noble river stole along in fearful silence, as if sensible of the frowning majesty which looked down upon its motion;' and the vessel, rapidly `walking the water like a thing of life,' seemed proud of her magnificent pathway. The little waves sporting and sparkling round her prow, the soft, silvery, sunny stream, trembling in her rear, and the wreaths of smoke rising as if in incense to the beauty of the scene, all conspired to make a steam-boat passing the Highlands one of the grandest objects I had ever seen. Soon the fortifications and buildings of West Point burst upon the view. At first we caught a distant glimpse of glittering arms, and then of the youthful band standing forth in all the pride of military discipline, as if ready for the work of death. “I had no idea of such scenery in America,” exclaimed the stranger. “It brings to my eye the wild picturesque, and sublime scenes which Scotland's great magician has imprinted on my imagination.” “And yet,” replied I, “it stands in its own simple majesty, without any of that pageantry of association which throws such enchantment around Europe and Asia.” “Every thing about your country has to the philosophic mind associations of moral grandeur,” rejoined he, “though destitute of the gorgeous blazonry of chivalry, or the wild romance of the crusades.” “You are then a foreigner?” said I. “I am so,” replied he, “in every country; for I have been too much a wanderer to call any place my home; perhaps England best deserves that appellation.” I seemed to have aroused melancholy recollections. A cloud passed over the clear expression of his face, and he was silent for several moments. Wishing to give a more pleasant turn to the conversation, I slipped my ring from my finger, and handing it to him, I said, “we were speaking of ancient rings just now—there is one of very curious workmanship.” As the hands unclasped, he sprang up with an exclamation that pierced my very brain. In the unconscious power of strong emotion he grasped my arm, till the veins swelled beneath his pressure. It was an instant before he could summon steadiness enough to say, “Oh, tell me whence came that ring!” When he was a little calmer, I told him its history as briefly as possible, for my curiosity was strongly excited to know the cause of such vehement interest. He listened with varied, but intense, expression as I proceeded, and suddenly interrupted me by exclaiming, “and where is that little West-Indian girl? Oh, sir, I'd give you wealth enough to buy a thousand consciences, if you could but tell me where she is!” “The interesting little creature has been twelve years in her grave,” said I; “but may I ask who it is that thus cherishes her memory?” “I am her brother Orlando,” replied he, “and I have a tale of fearful wickedness to tell you, about the charming companion of my infancy; but I have not time to detail it now. The boat is slackening her course and makes for the shore. I land at West Point—I trust you do too.” I answered that such was my intention, and made hasty preparations to quit the boat. My curiosity was so painfully excited, that I could hardly wait until the possession of a private room at the lodging house gave him an opportunity to explain his meaning. “I left Cuba for England, soon after my sister went to America,” he resumed; “and there I continued until after my father's death. I remained abroad and travelled even into the interiour of Asia, partly from a love of adventure, and partly because no fire-side endearments awaited me in Cuba. During my childhood, I received letters from Mr. Reynolds, informing me of my sister's health and progress in her education. Afterwards I received letters from herself which indicated entire contentment with her situation. It is not a year since I received one, in which she excused a draft upon our agent for a very large sum, by saying she found great calls upon her benevolence. I was glad she possessed this spirit. I answered the letter by a promise to be in Boston during the summer of 1820. I came—I eagerly inquired for Mr. Reynolds. The merchants said he had called in his debts very rapidly, left his affairs half settled, started very suddenly for Calcutta, and been shipwrecked. I asked for Angelina, and was assured she died soon after she came to this country, and the grave-stone bearing her name and age was then shown to me.” “The villain,” exclaimed I; “he concealed it, that he might appropriate her property to his own use!” “Oh, I could forgive him that,” cried the brother, almost convulsively; “yes, I could have forgiven him if he had taken the last shilling of my fortune; but—the child still lives—and I cannot discover her!” “The proof—tell me the proof,” said I. “I searched out one of the old servants,” he replied, “that I might learn all the particulars of my sister's illness. At first she shook her head mysteriously, and said she believed there had been some strange doings; and at last I induced her to tell me the old nurse had, on her death-bed, confessed that the child which slept under that grave-stone was not Angelina Gindrat, but her own daughter; that Mr. Reynolds had paid her handsomely for the deception; and that she believed the little West-Indian was put out at service in the country. Further than this, all my inquiries have been fruitless. I cannot discover the least trace of my injured sister; and I am roaming about the country with a sort of indefinite hope that Providence will lead me to a discovery of her retreat.” A sudden light came upon my mind, like an electric flash; and I was just on the point of saying, “your hope is realized!” but recollecting the extreme uncertainty of my conjectures, and the cruelty of exciting vain expectations, I checked the tumult of my feelings, and asked if there were any peculiarity by which he should know his sister. “In my boyhood,” answered he, “I pricked upon her right arm a carrier-dove, with a letter in his mouth; and on the day she bade me farewell, she held it to my lips and bade me kiss it.” I well recollected it, for Angelina had a hundred times talked of Orlando's little bird. Much conversation followed. I advised Mr. Gindrat to remain at West Point a short time, as he would, in all probability, see many strangers there, and by some extraordinary accident, light might gleam on this singular story; but I did not venture to express a hope which amounted almost to entire conviction. He consented to follow my advice, and I left him, to communicate with all speed, my hopes and fears to young Dudley. The Cadet gave me a reception exceedingly cordial and enthusiastic. “To see you at any time, is happiness for me,” said he, “but now, you are the very man, of all the world, I most wished to see; for I have lately received a commission from Miss Williams to find you, at all events, and bring you into her presence at the military ball, which is to be at New-York, the ensuing week. You are such a bird on the wing, that I have despatched letters to Philadelphia, Canandaigua, and New-York, which are the three last places from whence your letters have been dated, in hopes some one of them would reach you.” As soon as the bustle of meeting was over, I told him all with which the reader has been made acquainted, 15 and expatiated very largely upon my belief that Angelina Gindrat and Margaret Williams were one and the same person. I was a little disappointed at the calmness, and even sadness, with which Mr. Dudley heard my disclosure; and I reproached him for want of sympathy in my daughter's good fortune. “I will deal frankly with you,” replied the young man. “As your adopted child, admired and flattered by the rich and intelligent, I have long felt that my hold upon her remembrance was exceedingly precarious; but if she is heiress to this immense fortune, her hand will soon be sought by numbers, superior to me in all respects.” “I have no right to answer for Margaret's feelings,” rejoined I, “but of one thing I am certain: this change of fortune will make no change in her romantic nature.” This assurance somewhat dispelled his gloom, and having naturally the slightest possible degree of selfishness in his disposition, he soon entered with enthusiasm into all my hopes and fears. When I asked him if he had ever heard Mrs. Hagar describe the Mr. Vinton who left Margaret with them, he answered that he had. In every respect the description corresponded with my vivid recollection of Mr. Reynolds. A thousand trifling details tended so much to confirm my suspicions, that my eagerness to meet Margaret grew painful in its excess. Report said that the great southern beauty, Miss Fitzroy, was to be in New-York two days before the ball. Young Dudley and Mr. Gindrat accompanied me there. I awaited their arrival with the most eager impatience, and clasped Margaret to my heart the moment she alighted from the carriage. I pass over all the delight of meeting; all the thousand kind things said and thought; all the joy and timidity of young Dudley; and only pause to mention that in the short space of two days, I three times surprised Margaret Williams entirely absorbed in Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd, before I introduce my readers to the lighted ball-room. When I entered, with Margaret leaning on my arm, much of the company had already assembled, and an audible buzz of admiration followed her as we 15A passed along. Chandeliers, flowers, and groups of beautiful heads, always give to a ball-room the mellow brilliancy of fairy-land; but a military ball has charms peculiar to itself; it seems like a fragment of chivalry, and partakes of the high, poetic interest of tilts and tournaments. As I looked round upon the gay scene, I heard a loud whisper of applause, and soon perceived that it announced the entrance of my friend Miss Fitzroy. Her blazing and radiant beauty was of a character totally different from my Margaret's. Her face and figure were the statuary's embodied dream; her complexion was dazzlingly fair, and her eyes had an expression lucid and tranquil, as Lake George by summer's moonlight. In the Venus de Medicis, art studied nature, and in one form concentrated the graces of a thousand models; but it now seemed as if nature, vexed at the successful rivalry, had studied every line of beauty from Praxiteless to Canova, and thrown over the whole the rich colouring of Titian. She glided through the room with a majestic, swan-like motion, so modest in its pride, that it seemed like a total unconsciousness of her charms. While I was listening to some eloquent badinage upon having hurried Margaret away from her, I saw Mr. Gindrat enter. I had seen him much, and become more and more interested in him during the brief period I have mentioned; but as I became convinced that Margaret was his sister, I earnestly wished that he should meet her in public, and judge of her as an entire stranger. That she was Angelina Gindrat I had now no doubt; for under the pretence of telling her fortune, I had asked her to show me her arm. The carrier-dove and his letter were there as plain as when I first kissed that little arm on board the Amphitrite; and with deep fervour my heart thanked the all-wise Being who had thus enabled me unconsciously to fulfil my promise to Mrs. Reynolds. With excitement almost too tumultuous to be happy, I sought Mr. Gindrat, to introduce him to Margaret. “Who are those beautiful ladies you have just left?” inquired he, after the first salutation had passed. “It is the celebrated Miss 15B Fitzroy, from the south, and her friend Miss Williams,” replied I. “The one with pearls in her hair is the famous beauty. There's a divine proportion! Eyes fit for Phœbus' self to gild the world with; And there's a brow arch'd like the state of Heaven; Look, how it bends, and with what radiance, As if the synod of the Gods sat under; Look there, and wonder!” “She is indeed a beautiful creature,” rejoined he, “but what a queen-like figure stands beside her! How genius pours forth in torrents of expression! and how much graceful vivacity there is in the very bend of her neck!” “She is my adopted daughter,” said I, “and if you wish, I will introduce you.” “But why have I not heard of her before!” asked he, in a tone of surprise. “Oh, we have had weightier matters to talk of, you know, and rich young men are apt to suspect fathers, who are too anxious to introduce their daughters.” Smiling, he followed me toward the ladies, and I introduced him as a friend from Europe. Both were obviously prepossessed in his favour; and it was soon whispered among the circle of beaux, that Miss Fitzroy had never before condescended to treat any gentleman with so much attention. She accepted his invitation to dance, and they took their places at the head of the first cotillion. Two reputed lovers of Margaret's were making their way toward her, when she involuntarily gave an earnest glance toward the place where Dudley stood aloof, apparently in no very cheerful mood. He met the expressive look, and was instantly at her side. I heard much animated conversation whenever the couples met in the windings of the dance; and when the ladies were seated near me, Gindrat took his station at Margaret's side. “These orange and lemon trees,” said he, “almost make me imagine myself in my native island; and there are flowers here to night,” added he, with marked emphasis, “so like the productions of my sunny clime, that the recollections of my childhood come vividly before me; and he went on describing the beauties of tropical regions with surprising volubility and eloquence. Miss Fitzroy listened with a marked interest, which made some of her admirers frown; and Margaret gave one of her most fascinating smiles, as she said, “I have strange thoughts sometimes. As you describe these scenes, it seems to me like recalling a dream long since forgotten. Visions crowd on my memory, and are gone before I can trace their outline. I am half tempted to believe in the transmigration of souls. Who knows but that, as a happy little bird, I have floated over the scenes you describe so well? Gindrat listened with a mingled air of deference and admiration; and Dudley gave me a glance full of prophetic meaning. The two beauties were soon after engaged in another dance. Margaret was Mr. Gindrat's partner, and I watched their growing interest in each other, with a heart even more happy than their own. I had resolved that the denouement should take place the next day, and my imagination was rapidly running over the scene—when Margaret chanced to drop her bracelet. Mr. Gindrat took it up, and as she stepped aside to clasp it he remarked the beauty of the workmanship. It was an exquisitely cut cameo of Psyche, upon a yellow ground. After looking at it, an instant, “May I have the honour?” said he, offering to place it upon her arm. Her lace sleeve was slightly deranged, and she turned her arm to adjust it. A half suppressed ejaculation burst from Gindrat's lips, and reeling with faintness, he leaned against the folding doors. I supported him to the air. “Put me into a carriage,” said he quickly, “and come with me—come with me.” I saw how it was—the transparent sleeve had betrayed the carrier-dove, and all my plans of a regular catastrophe were frustrated. * * * * * * * When I asked my new friend to forgive me for thus concealing my conjectures—“Say nothing of forgiveness,” cried he. “To find her at all, would have been a blessing. Yes, even in ignorance and obscurity; but to find her thus—so elegant—so well educated—Oh, may heaven bless you! may heaven bless you! Money can, and shall reward her rough country protectors; but you—Oh, may heaven bless you!” All the wonder and joy which followed can be better imagined than expressed. Crowds of suitors contended with each other for the bright West-Indian prize. To all, she gave a kind, but very decided negative; and all her friends, except Frank Dudley, divined the cause. The sight of Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd marked in many interesting places, and blistered with tears, did at length enable hope to weigh down the long fluctuating scale in his distrustful mind. Mr. Gindrat felt grateful to his sister's long-tried friend, the beautiful Miss Fitzroy; and in his enthusiastic nature, gratitude changed to love almost as suddenly as the aloe bursts into blossom when touched by fairy wand. Both the lovers were made happy by a frank avowal of reciprocated attachment; and one bright June day witnessed their splendid bridals. Mr. Gindrat has sold his West-India property, and purchased two beautiful plantations in Virginia; and Angelina and Orlando live within sight of each other's piazzas. I care less about rambling, now that my heart has such a happy home; but I have not lost, and I trust I shall never lose, an active, affectionate interest in my fellow creatures, though I am an odd old bachelor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A NEW YEAR'S OFFERING TO A FRIEND. A happy New Year, thou lovely one! As bright as roses bathed in sun— Around thy path may the dancing hours Scatter wreaths of radiant flowers! On thy pure cheek health's mantling glow Flits like a sun-blush o'er the snow; And the soft shade of thy raven hair Rests on a brow so passing fair, I dare not think, majestic maid, Thy soul-lit beauty e'er can fade. And may it not—I would that thou, With gentle lip and lofty brow, And the changing light of thy lucid eye, Should'st live on earth immortally! Sure life and love must stay with thee, Chain'd by thy potent witchery. Yet would I not the flatt'ring throng Should lure thee with a syren song— 'Twere better far for one pure heart To love for what thou really art: Not a painted toy to please awhile, To feign a blush, and act a smile— But one whose noble, generous soul, Spurn's affection's mean control; Who life's most sparkling cup has quaff'd, Uninjured by the dang'rous draught. 'Tis this that binds me with a spell, Whose power I find no words to tell. A happy New Year, thou lovely one! As bright as roses bathed in sun— Around thy path may the dancing hours Scatter wreaths of radiant flowers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NATURE AND SIMPLICITY. “The tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.” Byron. No one of gifted mind has passed even the first freshness of youth, without feeling that it is not with him as it has been. Knowledge and taste may have increased his intellectual riches, and association may have added her powerful spell to half the charms of nature; but the soul does not rejoice in these possessions, as it once did in the simple wealth of birds and flowers. “The sunshine is a glorious birth; But yet we know, where'er we go, That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.” We talk very philosophically of the negative enjoyments of childhood; and try to convince ourselves that the light and glory which memory throws around it, are but the delusions of imagination. It is not well to argue thus. There is deep meaning in the maxim, “Reverence little children;” and it would be better for us, both here and hereafter, if we inscribed it on our hearts as a spell against the festering influence of our own bad passions. I would not, with sickly sentimentality, mourn over states of mind never to be entirely recalled: this idle habit has too often wasted the strength of intellect, and been assumed by inferior minds, incapable of imitating anything of genius except its errors. But if we observe that all the world look back to the earlier stages of being with fond regret, ought we not to suppose there is strong reason for so deep a feeling? If the thoughts and affections were then veiled in a robe of sunbeams, should we not ask whence the light came, and why it now visits us so transiently? There is but one answer—we are simple and artless then. Therefore the influence of God is around us, and within us, like the atmosphere we breathe, sustaining life and giving joy to those who perchance have never known there was an atmosphere. If, then, there is such close sympathy between simplicity and heaven, let us earnestly strive to “be as little children.” It is not well to be too wise for happiness; it is not safe to be too learned for salvation. Byron was an intellectual Laocoon, writhing majestically in the embrace of serpents himself had wakened into life; but how much wiser and happier is that meek and quiet poet, who finds in a simple wild-flower “thoughts too deep for tears.” Every thing that we involuntarily love is true to nature; and nothing that we learn to love produces fresh and glowing emotions. What is genius? It is but a fitting expression of that which Nature teaches the soul; and when our hearts thrill in sympathy with this mysterious power, we wonder that those simple feelings, which form the very elements of our common nature, are not always as artlessly expressed. What are gracefulness and majesty? We find them in the rapid gambols of the antelope, and the stately motion of the eagle; and we love and admire them because they speak of happy freedom, careless of observers. Art, with her utmost skill, never touches the heart, unless she makes herself forgotten by her close imitation of nature. Why do we suffer pride, vanity, or ambition, to take from us a gift, which we exert all our faculties to seem to possess? Our religion expressly tells us how to “enter the kingdom of heaven;” our own hearts repeat it with mournful tenderness, whenever we look on the guilenessness of infancy; and why do we persist in disobeying the lesson? The haughty soul of man has always scorned simplicity. He, that was told to wash in the pool, and be healed, was indignant because he was not commanded to perform some great thing; and thus it ever is with us self-sufficient mortals. We are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices, and act an arduous part, in order to attain the very character that would be the natural result of a simple and sincere course. We destroy the vitality of nature by engrafting upon her motives taught by worldly selfishness; and we are then obliged to counterfeit what we cannot regain. This is the reason “a glory has departed from the earth;” and for this cause do the welcome indications of its return come so rarely and so briefly, to gladden the rich in mind, and innocent of heart. If we were willing to “become as little children,” we should keep our souls open to the holy influence of God's works, as well as his word; and then we should not have cause to mourn over the faded brightness of our youth. The Dodonian oracle spoke through doves and trees; and the pure in heart may still hear a voice in nature proclaiming truth from heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHOCORUA'S CURSE. The rocky county of Strafford, New-Hampshire, is remarkable for its wild and broken scenery. Ranges of hills towering one above another, as if eager to look upon the beautiful country, which afar off lies sleeping in the embrace of heaven; precipices, from which the young eagles take their flight to the sun; dells rugged and tangled as the dominions of Roderick Vich Alpine, and ravines dark and deep enough for the death scene of a bandit, form the magnificent characteristics of this picturesque region. A high precipice, called Chocorua's Cliff, is rendered peculiarly interesting by a legend which tradition has scarcely saved from utter oblivion. Had it been in Scotland, perhaps the genius of Sir Walter would have hallowed it, and Americans would have crowded there to kindle fancy on the altar of memory. 17 Being in the midst of our own romantic scenery, it is little known, and less visited; for the vicinity is as yet untraversed by railroads or canals, and no “Mountain House,” perched on these tremendous battlements, allures the traveller hither to mock the majesty of nature with the insipidities of fashion. Our distinguished artist, Mr. Cole, found the sunshine and the winds sleeping upon it in solitude and secresy; and his pencil has brought it before us in its stern repose. In olden time, when Goffe and Whalley passed for wizards and mountain spirits among the superstitious, the vicinity of the spot we have been describing was occupied by a very small colony, which, either from discontent or enterprise, had retired into this remote part of New-Hampshire. Most of them were ordinary men, led to this independent mode of life from an impatience of restraint, which as frequently accompanies vulgar obstinacy as generous pride. But there was one master spirit among them, who was capable of a higher destiny than he ever fulfilled. The consciousness of this had stamped something of proud humility on the face of Cornelius Campbell; something of a haughty spirit, strongly curbed by circumstances he could not control, and at which he scorned to murmur. He assumed no superiority; but unconsciously he threw around him the spell of intellect, and his companions felt, they knew not why, that he was “among them, but not of them.” His stature was gigantic, and he had the bold, quick tread of one who had wandered frequently and fearlessly among the terrible hiding-places of nature. His voice was harsh, but his whole countenance possessed singular capabilities for tenderness of expression; and sometimes, under the gentle influence of domestic excitement, his hard features would be rapidly lighted up, seeming like the sunshine flying over the shaded fields in an April day. His companion was one peculiarly calculated to excite and retain the deep, strong energies of manly love. She had possessed extraordinary beauty; and had, in the full maturity of an excellent judgment, relinquished 16A several splendid alliances, and incurred her father's displeasure, for the sake of Cornelius Campbell. Had political circumstances proved favourable, his talents and ambition would unquestionably have worked out a path to emolument and fame; but he had been a zealous and active enemy of the Stuarts, and the restoration of Charles the Second was the death-warrant of his hopes. Immediate flight became necessary, and America was the chosen place of refuge. His adherence to Cromwell's party was not occasioned by religious sympathy, but by political views, too liberal and philosophical for the state of the people; therefore Cornelius Campbell was no favourite with our forefathers, and being of a proud nature, he withdrew with his family to the solitary place we have mentioned. It seemed a hard fate for one who had from childhood been accustomed to indulgence and admiration, yet Mrs. Campbell enjoyed more than she had done in her days of splendour; so much deeper are the sources of happiness than those of gaiety. Even her face had suffered little from time and hardship. The bloom on her cheek, which in youth had been like the sweet-pea blossom, that most feminine of all flowers, had, it is true, somewhat faded; but her rich, intellectual expression, did but receive additional majesty from years; and the exercise of quiet domestic love, which, where it is suffered to exist, always deepens and brightens with time, had given a bland and placid expression, which might well have atoned for the absence of more striking beauty. To such a woman as Caroline Campbell, of what use would have been some modern doctrines of equality and independence? With a mind sufficiently cultivated to appreciate and enjoy her husband's intellectual energies, she had a heart that could not have found another home. The bird will drop into its nest though the treasures of earth and sky are open. To have proved marriage a tyranny, and the cares of domestic life a thraldom, would have affected Caroline Campbell as little, as to be told that the pure, sweet atmosphere she breathed, was 17B pressing upon her so many pounds to every square inch! Over such a heart, and such a soul, external circumstances have little power; all worldly interest was concentrated in her husband and babes, and her spirit was satisfied with that inexhaustible fountain of joy which nature gives, and God has blessed. A very small settlement, in such a remote place, was of course subject to inconvenience and occasional suffering. From the Indians they received neither injury nor insult. No cause of quarrel had ever arisen; and, although their frequent visits were sometimes troublesome, they never had given indications of jealousy or malice. Chocorua was a prophet among them, and as such an object of peculiar respect. He had a mind which education and motive would have nerved with giant strength; but growing up in savage freedom, it wasted itself in dark, fierce, ungovernable passions. There was something fearful in the quiet haughtiness of his lip—it seemed so like slumbering power, too proud to be lightly roused, and too implacable to sleep again. In his small, black, fiery eye, expression lay coiled up like a beautiful snake. The white people knew that his hatred would be terrible; but they had never provoked it, and even the children became too much accustomed to him to fear him. Chocorua had a son, about nine or ten years old, to whom Caroline Campbell had occasionally made such gaudy presents as were likely to attract his savage fancy. This won the child's affections, so that he became a familiar visitant, almost an inmate of their dwelling; and being unrestrained by the courtesies of civilized life, he would inspect everything, and taste of everything which came in his way. Some poison, prepared for a mischievous fox, which had long troubled the little settlement, was discovered and drunk by the Indian boy; and he went home to his father to sicken and die. From that moment jealousy and hatred took possession of Chocorua's soul. He never told his suspicions—he brooded over them in secret, to nourish the deadly revenge he contemplated against Cornelius Campbell. The story of Indian animosity is always the same. Cornelius Campbell left his hut for the fields early one bright, balmy morning in June. Still a lover, though ten years a husband, his last look was turned towards his wife, answering her parting smile—his last action a kiss for each of his children. When he returned to dinner, they were dead—all dead! and their disfigured bodies too cruelly showed that an Indian's hand had done the work! In such a mind grief, like all other emotions, was tempestuous. Home had been to him the only verdant spot in the wide desert of life. In his wife and children he had garnered up all his heart; and now they were torn from him, the remembrance of their love clung to him like the death-grapple of a drowning man, sinking him down, down, into darkness and death. This was followed by a calm a thousand times more terrible— the creeping agony of despair, that brings with it no power of resistance. “It was as if the dead could feel The icy worm around him steal.” Such, for many days, was the state of Cornelius Campbell. Those who knew and reverenced him, feared that the spark of reason was forever extinguished. But it rekindled again, and with it came a wild, demoniac spirit of revenge. The death-groan of Chocorua would make him smile in his dreams; and when he waked, death seemed too pitiful a vengeance for the anguish that was eating into his very soul. Chocorua's brethern were absent on a hunting expedition at the time he committed the murder; and those who watched his movements observed that he frequently climbed the high precipice, which afterward took his name, probably looking out for indications of their return. Here Cornelius Campbell resolved to effect his deadly purpose. A party was formed under his guidance, to cut off all chance of retreat, and the dark-minded prophet was to be hunted like a wild beast to his lair. The morning sun had scarce cleared away the fogs when Chocorua started at a loud voice from beneath the precipice, commanding him to throw himself into the deep abyss below. He knew the voice of his enemy, and replied with an Indian's calmness, “The Great Spirit gave life to Chocorua; and Chocorua will not throw it away at the command of a white man.” “Then hear the Great Spirit speak in the white man's thunder!” exclaimed Cornelius Campbell, as he pointed his gun to the precipice. Chocorua, though fierce and fearless as a panther, had never overcome his dread of fire-arms. He placed his hand upon his ears to shut out the stunning report; the next moment the blood bubbled from his neck, and he reeled fearfully on the edge of the precipice. But he recovered himself, and, raising himself on his hands, he spoke in a loud voice, that grew more terrific as its huskiness increased, “A curse upon ye, white men! May the Great Spirit curse ye when he speaks in the clouds, and his words are fire! Chocorua had a son—and ye killed him while his eye still loved to look on the bright sun, and the green earth! The Evil Spirit breathe death upon your cattle! Your graves lie in the war path of the Indian! Panthers howl, and wolves fatten over your bones! Chocorua goes to the Great Spirit—his curse stays with the white men!” The prophet sunk upon the ground, still uttering inaudible curses—and they left his bones to whiten in the sun. But his curse rested on the settlement. The tomahawk and scalping knife were busy among them, the winds tore up trees and hurled them at their dwellings, their crops were blasted, their cattle died, and sickness came upon their strongest men. At last the remnant of them departed from the fatal spot to mingle with more populous and prosperous colonies. Cornelius Campbell became a hermit, seldom seeking or seeing his fellow men; and two years after he was found dead in his hut. To this day the town of Burton, in New-Hampshire, is remarkable for a pestilence which infects its cattle; and the superstitious think that Chocorua's spirit still sits enthroned upon his precipice, breathing a curse upon them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO A HUSBAND, Who presented, as a New-Year's Offering, a Heart and a Laurel wreath, the leaves of which were not very abundant. I care not for the wreath of laurel It never soothed my brow— Its scanty leaves convey a moral, I've learned full well ere now. And could fame's fairest amplest dower Descend to one like me, I'd not exchange a transient hour Of sunny smiles from thee! Then take the wreath—I love the heart— For 'tis a type of thine— From such a gift I cannot part, While there is life in mine. But keep the wreath—I prize it not, While I am loved by thee; And should my image be forgot, Oh! what were crowns to me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST AND LAST BOOK. One remembers writing his first book as distinctly as he recollects the first time he saw the ocean. Like the unquiet sea, all the elements of our nature are then heaving and tumultuous. Restless, insatiable ambition, is on us like a fiery charm. Every thing partakes of the brightness and boundlessness of our own hopes. Nature is encircled with a perpetual glory; and the seasons, as they pass on, scatter pearls and diamonds for our abundant fancy. It then seems strange how mortals can avoid being intellectually great; for irresistible inspiration appears to stream in upon the human mind, like the light and heat of the sun. Creation is an open volume of poetry and truth, and it seems as if whoever glanced upon it must read what angels have written there. We then feel interested in all the world, and think all the world must feel interested in us: yet it is not vanity—it is simply the expansive power of a youthful ambitious mind, measuring its strength by its hopes. We then write because we cannot help it— the mind is a full fountain that will overflow —and if the waters sparkle as they fall, it is from their own impetuous abundance. Such are the feelings with which we write at first. Afterward, the cares of the world press heavily on the spirit. The smiles of the public no longer have power to kindle us into enthusiastic energy; and its frowns fall like a shadow on the rock. We learn that ambition is not always power—that the eager eye may be fastened on the sun, but the weary wing can never reach it. The goal, which once appeared bright in the distance, is despised because another still brighter lies beyond it—and when we know how unsatisfactory that too would prove, if gained, how can it be pursued with eagerness? Whoever seeks for fame rolls the stone of Sisyphus. When we have grown old at the task, the sight of young ambition sometimes makes us smile in sad mockery of its hopes; and we feel that imagination has no bitterer curse to bestow upon an enemy. But thoughts like these are merely the occasional struggles of the giant beneath the mountain he cannot heave from him. In general, the love of quiet rests on the mind like a drowsy spell; and we are well content to have for our epitaph that we have lived, and have died. Alas, that the proud and weary spirit cannot always rest! The opal, pale, and cold, and cloudy, as it seems, has a spark of fire forever imprisoned in its bosom. The last book, like the first, may indeed be written because we cannot help it: not that the full mind overflows—but the printer's boy stands at our elbow. We then look to bookseller's accounts for inspiration, hunt for pearls because we have promised to furnish them, and string glass beads because they will sell better than diamonds. Such is the difference between the first and last of all things the world can give us. We start fresh and vigorous, as if life were a revelry—the game proves to be a battle, hardly worth the winning—and we pause mid-way tired and disheartened, content to dream ourselves into the realities of death. But there are gifts, over which the world has no power. Religious hope, and deep domestic love, can meet no change, except the transfer from a happy earth to a happier heaven. The heart,—blessed be God! the heart never grows old.</field>
