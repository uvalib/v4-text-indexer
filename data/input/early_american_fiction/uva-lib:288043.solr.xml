      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 2 CHAPTER I. HISTORICAL SUMMARY.—THE SWAMP RETREAT. The colonies of North America, united in resistance to the mother country, had now closed the fifth year of their war of independence. The scene of conflict was now almost wholly transferred from the northern to the southern colonies. The former were permitted a partial repose, while the latter, as if to compensate for a three years' respite, were subjected to the worst aspects and usages of war. Georgia and South Carolina were supposed by the British commanders to be entirely recovered to the sway of their master. They suffered, in consequence, the usual fortune of the vanquished. But the very suffering proved that they lived, and the struggle for freedom was continued. Her battles, “Once begun, Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son, Though often lost,” were never considered by her friends in Carolina to be utterly hopeless. Still, they had frequent occasion to despair. Gates, the successful commander at Saratoga, upon whose great renown and feeble army the hopes of the south, for a season, appeared wholly to depend, had suffered a terrible defeat at Camden—his militia scattered to the four winds of Heaven—his regulars almost annihilated in a conflict with thrice their number, which, for fierce encounter and determined resolution, has never been surpassed;—while he, himself, a fugitive, covered with shame and disappointment, vainly hung out his tattered banner in the wilds of North Carolina—a colony sunk into an apathy which as effectually paralysed her exertions, as did the presence of superior power paralyse those of her more suffering sisters. Conscious of indiscretion and a most fatal presumption—the punishment of which had been as sudden as it was severe—the defeated general suffered far less from apprehension of his foes, than of his country. He had madly risked her strength, at a perilous moment, in a pitched battle, for which he had made no preparation —in which he had shown neither resolution nor ability. The laurels of his old renown withered in an instant—his reputation was stained with doubt, if not with dishonour. He stood, anxious and desponding, awaiting, with whatever moral strength he could command, the summons to that tribunal of his peers, upon which depended all the remaining honours of his venerable head. General Greene succeeded to the command of the miserable remnant of the southern army. Cool, prudent and resolute, this able soldier came to his task with a noble determination to rescue South Carolina from the grasp of the invader, or to perish in the attempt. Bold as was the resolution which he entertained and expressed, it was yet unaccompanied by any rashness of movement or design. Greene was very soon made conscious that, with the mere fragments of an army—and such an army!—naked men, undrilled militia, few in number, disheartened by defeat, unprovided with arms—he could hope for nothing but disaster, unless through the exercise of that ever watchful thought, and rigorous prudence, by which, almost wholly, the great captain is distinguished. His wariness formed an essential part of his resolution, and quite as much as his valour, contributed to effect his object. If he did not always beat, he at length succeeded in finally baffling, his opponents. He avoided the conflict which the more presumptuous Gates had too rashly invited. To baffle the invader, he well knew, was the best policy by which to conquer him. The fatigue of forced marches and frequent alarms to the soldier, in an unknown and hostile country, is more discouraging than the actual fight with a superior foe. Every hour of delay added to the army of Greene while it diminished that of the British. The militia recovered breath and courage, and once more rallied around the continental standard. Small but select bodies of troops came to her aid from the neighbouring states. North Carolina began to arouse and shake herself free from her slumbers. Her yeomen began to feel the shame of previous flight and inaction. Virginia, though scarcely so active as her own safety and sense of duty should have made her, was not altogether indifferent to the earnest entreaties for assistance of the general of the south;—and from Maryland and Delaware came a band, few but fearless, and surpassed by none of all the troops that were ever raised in America. The tried and tough natives of the mountains and the swamps emerged once more from their hiding places under their ancient leaders; more resolute in the cause of liberty, and more vigorous in their labours for its attainment, from the shame and the sorrow which followed their previous and frequent disappointments. The countenance of the British commander became troubled as he surveyed the gathering aspects of evil in that horizon, from which he fondly fancied that he had banished every cloud. His troops were summoned to arms and to renewed activity; and Greene was no longer in a condition to elude the arms of his adversary. Nor did he now so much desire it. The accessions of force which his army had received, and which drew upon him the regards of Lord Cornwallis, had necessarily encouraged the American general, and inspirited his purposes. His policy, though still properly cautious, lost something of its seeming timidity; and he boldly penetrated, in the face of the foe, into the state which he came to deliver. A series of small and indecisive, but briliant adventures, which followed the dispersion of his light troops over the country, contributed equally to enliven the hopes of the commander and the courage of his men. The battle of King's Mountain had been fought, in which the British force under Ferguson was annihilated. Tarleton, hitherto invincible, was beaten by Morgan at the Cowpens, with a vastly inferior army; while Marion, smiting the tories, hip and thigh, in the swamps below;—and Sumter, in a succession of brilliant and rapid actions, in the middle country; had paralysed the activity and impaired seriously the strength of those smaller parties of the British, which were employed to overawe the inhabitants and secure the conquests which had been already made. In an inconceivably short space of time, the aspect of things in South Carolina underwent a change. The panic which followed the defeat of Gates, had worn off. Disaffection so effectually showed itself in every section of the state, that the British power was found active and operative only in those portions where they held strong garrisons. Greene, however, while these events were passing, was kept sufficiently employed by the able captains who opposed him. Brought to action at Guilford, he was forced, rather than beaten, from the field; and a few days enabled him to turn upon his pursuer, and to dog his flight from the state which he could not keep, to that in which he became a captive. But, in leaving Carolina, Cornwallis left the interests of his master in the custody of no inferior representative. Lord Rawdon, afterwards the Earl of Moira, succeeded him in the command. He was unquestionably one of the ablest general officers of the British army; and through a protracted trial of strength with his opponent, he sustained the duties of his trust with equal skill, vigilance and valour. The descent of Greene into South Carolina, brought him into that same neighbourhood which had proved so fatal to Gates. His appearance was followed by the sharp action of Hobkirk's Hill, in which Rawdon displayed many of those essential qualities of conduct which entitle him to the name of an able soldier. The field remained with the British, but it yielded them none but barren fruits. It gave them the triumph, but not the success. The victory was only not with Greene. It must have been, but for a misapprehension of his orders, on the part of one of his best officers, having command of a favourite regiment. Our story opens at this period. The battle of Hobkirk's Hill was productive of effects upon both of the contending parties, which brought about an equal crisis in their fortunes. The losses of the two armies, on that occasion, were nearly the same. But, in the case of Rawdon, the country offered but few resources against any external pressure, and immediate and utter ruin must have followed 2* his defeat. He had exhausted the means, ravaged the fields, trampled upon the feelings, and mocked the entreaties of the surrounding inhabitants. Despair had taught them a spirit of defiance, and the appearance of an American army which was able to maintain its ground even after defeat, encouraged them to give to that feeling its proper utterance. Cornwallis had long before complained to the British ministry that he was “surrounded by timid friends and inveterate foes;” and the diminution of British strength and courage which necessarily followed the flight of that commander into Virginia, together with the defeats sustained at Cowpens and King's Mountain, naturally enough increased the timidity of the one, and the inveteracy of the other party. That atrocious and reckless warfare between the whigs and tories, which had deluged the fair plains of Carolina with native blood, was now at its height. The parties, in the language of General Greene, pursued each other like wild beasts. Pity seemed utterly banished from their bosoms. Neither sex nor age was secure. Murder lurked upon the threshold, and conflagration lighted up, with the blazing fires of ruin, the still, dark hours of midnight. The reckless brutality of the invader furnished a sufficient example and provocation to these atrocities: and the experience of ages has shown that hate never yet takes a form so hellish, as when it displays itself in the strifes of kindred. It does not need that we should inquire, at this late day, what were the causes that led to this division among a people, in that hour so unseasonably chosen for civil strife—the hour of foreign invasion. It is sufficient for our present purpose that the fact, however lamentable, is equally unquestionable and well known. Our narrative seeks to illustrate some of the events which grew out of, and characterized, this warfare. We shall be compelled to display, along with its virtues of courage, patriotism and endurance, some of its crimes and horrors! Yet vainly, as unwisely, would we desire to depict, in human language, its measureless atrocities. The heart would sicken, the mind revolt with loathing, at those hideous details, in which the actors seem to have studiously set themselves free from all the restraints of humanity. To burn and slay were not the simple performances of this reckless period and ravaged country. To burn in wantonness, and to murder in cold blood, and by the cruellest tortures, were the familiar achievements of the time;—and the criminal was too frequently found to exult over his evil deeds, with the sanguinary enthusiasm of the Mohawk warrior, even though the avenging retribution stood beside him with warning finger and uplifted knife. The face of the country was overrun by outlaws. Detached bands of ruffians, formed upon the frontiers of Georgia, and in the wilds of Florida, availed themselves of the absence of civil authority, to effect a lodgment in the swamps, the forests and the mountains. These, mounted on fleet horses, traversed the state with the wind; now here, now there; one moment operating on the Savannah, the next on the Peedee. Sometimes descending within sight of the smokes of the metropolis; and anon, building their own fires on the lofty summits of Apalachia and the Ridge. Harassed by the predatory inroads of these outlawed squadrons, stung by their insults, and maddened by their enormities, the more civil and suffering inhabitants, gathered in little bands for their overthrow; and South Carolina, at the period of our narrative, presented the terrible spectacle of an entire people in arms, and hourly engaging in the most sanguinary conflicts. The district of country called “Ninety-Six,” in the neighbourhood of which our story will chiefly lie, is estimated to have had within its borders, at the close of the revolution, no less than fifteen hundred widows and orphans, made so during its progress. Despair seems to have blinded the one party as effectually to the atrocity of their deeds, as that drunkenness of heart, which follows upon long continued success, had made insensible the other;— and as that hour is said to be the darkest which more immediately precedes the dawn, so was that the bloodiest in the fortunes of Carolina which ushered in the bright day of her deliverance. We now proceed with our narrative. The dusky shadows of evening were approaching fast. Clouds, black with storm, that threatened momently to discharge their torrents, depended gloomily above the bosom of the Wateree. A deathlike stillness overhung the scene. The very breezes that had swayed the tops of the tall cypresses, and sported capriciously with the purple berries of the green vines that decorated them, had at length folded themselves up to slumber on the dark surface of the sluggish swamps below. No voice of bird or beast, no word of man, denoted, in that ghostlike region, the presence of any form of life. Nothing in its aspects, certainly, could persuade the casual wayfarer to suspect that a single human heart beat within those wild and dark recesses. Gloomy, and dense, and dim, at all seasons, the very tribute of the spring in this—the generous gifts of flowers and fruitage—only served to increase the depth of its shadow in the rank exuberance of its vegetable life. The vines, and shrubs, and briars, massed themselves together in an almost solid wall upon its edge, and forbade to penetrate; and even where, through temporary vistas, the eye obtained a passage beyond this formidable barrier, the dismal lakes which it encountered—still and black—filled with the decayed trunks of past centuries, and surmounted by towering ranks yet in the vigour of their growth, defied the examination of the curious, and seemed to rebuke, with frowning and threatening shadows, even the presumption of a search. But in the perilous times of our history, these seeming discouragements served the kindly purposes of security and shelter. The swamps of Carolina furnished a place of refuge to the patriot and fugitive, when the dwelling and the temple yielded none. The more dense the wall of briars upon the edge of the swamp, the more dismal the avenues within, the more acceptable to those who, preferring liberty over all things, could there build her altars and tend her sacred fires, without being betrayed by their smokes. The scene to which our eyes have been addressed, still and deathlike as it appears, was full of life,— of hearts that beat with hope, and spirits that burned with animation; and sudden, even as we gaze, the sluggish waters of the lake are rippling into tiny waves that betray the onward motion of some unwonted burden. In the moment of its deepest silence, a rustling is heard among the green vines and crowding foliage. A gentle strife takes place between the broken waters and the rude trunks of the cypresses; and the prow of an Indian bark shoots suddenly through the tangled masses, toward the unsuspicious shore. A single person stands upright in the centre of the little vessel and guides it in its forward progress through the still lagunes. Yet no dip of oar, no stroke of paddle betrays his efforts, and impairs the solemn silence of the scene. It speeds along as noiselessly and with as little effort, as did that fairy bark of Phædria which carried Sir Guyon over the Idle Lake to the Enchanted Island:— “Withouten oare or pilot it to guide, Or winged canvass with the wind to fly.” The navigator of our little canoe is indebted for her progress to no magical “pin,” such as impelled the vessel of Phædria and obeyed the least touch of that laughing enchantress. Still, the instrument which he employed, if less magical in its origin, was quite as simple in its use. It called for almost as little exertion of his arm. His wand of power was an ordinary cane, nearly twenty feet in length, the vigorous growth of the swamp around him, to the slender extremity of which, a crotchet, cut from the forked branches of some stubborn hickory, was tightly fastened; one prong of the fork being left free, and presenting the appearance of a curved finger. Grasping this instrument at the base, he employed the hook at its extremity, with equal dexterity and ease, to the overhanging limbs of the trees, or the scattered links of the thousand vines which swung above him in the air; and by this process impelled his vessel in any direction. The yellow waters of the swamp parted before his prow at the slightest touch of this simple agent; and the obedient fabric which it impelled with a corresponding flexibility, yielding itself readily, shot from side to side, through the sinuous avenues of the swamp;—as if endued with a consciousness and impulse of its own, pressing along in silence and in shadow; now darting freely forward where the stream widened into little lakelets; now buried in masses of the thicket, so dense and low, that the steersman was scarcely suffered time to sink upon his knee, in seeking to pass beneath the green umbrageous arches. In such a progress the scene was not without its romance. Picturesque as was this mode of journeying, it had its concomitants by which it was rendered yet more so. The instrument which impelled the vessel, drew down to the hand of the steersman the massy vines of the thousand varieties of wild grape with which the middle country of Carolina is literally covered. These fling themselves with the wind in which they swing and sport, arching themselves from tree to tree, and interlacing their green tresses until the earth below becomes a stranger to the sun. Their blue clusters droop to the hand, and hang around the brows of the fainting and feeble partisan, returning from the conflict. He forgets the cruelties of his fellow man, in solacing himself with the grateful tributes which are yielded him by the bounteous nature. Their fruits relieve his hunger and quench his thirst—their green leaves refresh his eye—their shadows protect him from the burning sun-beams, and conceal him from the pursuit of the foe. Dark, wild, and unlovely as the entrance of the swamp might seem, still, to the musing heart and contemplative spirit it had its aspects of beauty, if not of brightness; and, regarded through the moral medium as a place of refuge to the virtuous and the good, when lovelier spots afforded none, it rises at once before the mind, into an object of sacred and serene delight. Its mysterious outlets, its Druid-like nooks, its little islands of repose, its solemn groves, and their adorning parasites, which clamber up and cling to its slender columns an hundred feet in air, flinging abroad their tendrils, laden with flaunting blossoms, and purple berries; presented a picture of strange but harmonious combination, to which the youthful steersman who guides our little bark was evidently not insensible. He paused at moments in favourite spots, and his large blue eye seemed to dilate, as, looking upward, he caught, at moments, far, foreign glimpses of the heavens through the ragged tops of the forest. Were the features of the face sure indices of the human character, his might well be assumed to be one in which the passion for the picturesque entered largely, without conflicting, however, with the more necessary qualities of decision of mind, and directness of aim and performance. It would not, indeed, be altogether safe to say, that, when he paused in his progress through the swamp, it was not because of some more serious purpose than belonged to a desire to contemplate the picturesque in its aspects. A just caution, the result of that severe experience which the Carolinians had suffered in the beginning of their conflict with the mother country, may have prompted him to wait, and watch, and listen, long before he approached the land. His movements were all marked by the vigilance of one who was fully conscious of the near neighbourhood of danger. Before his vessel could emerge from the covert, and when a single moment would have thrust her against the shore, he grasped with his hook a swinging vine which he had already left behind him, and arrested her motion. His boat swung lightly upon her centre, and remained stationary for a brief instant, while, drawing from his vest a small instrument of cane, he uttered a clear merry sound, which went, waking up an hundred echoes, through the still recesses of the swamp. His whistle, thrice repeated, brought him as many faint responses from the foot of the hills to which he was approaching; and with a single farther effort our steersman threw himself flat in the bottom of his little vessel, which passed under a mass of foliage that drooped down upon the water, and in another moment her shallow prow darted upward upon the shore. The youth, having fastened her securely amidst the umbrage that grew upon the banks, now made his way toward the hills, where stood one who seemed to have been for some time, but not impatiently, awaiting his approach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE FRIENDS.—A CONFERENCE. The stranger, as he leaped upon the solid earth, appeared of a noble and commanding presence. In shape he was symmetrically and vigorously made. Tall, erect and muscular, his person was that of one who had been long accustomed to hardy and active exercises. In his movements there was a confident ease—the result equally of a fearless spirit and a noble form—which tallied well with a certain military exactness of carriage; commending his well-finished limbs to the eye, while conveying to the mind of the observer an impression, not less favourable, of the noble and firm character of their proprietor. Nor were the features of his countenance wanting in any thing which might support this impression. His face was full but not fleshy; the skin, a clear red and white, which the summer sun had simply darkened into manliness. His eye, of a lively and intelligent blue, might have denoted a rather preponderating playfulness of temper, but for the sterner expression of his mouth, the lines of which were more angular than round, the lips being too thin for softness, and when compressed, indicating a severe directness of purpose, which the gentler expression of his other features failed entirely to qualify. He had a lofty forehead, broad, intellectual, and contemplative. His hair, which was of a dark brown colour, was long, and, like his beard, had been suffered to remain untrimmed, possibly as much in compliance with the laws of necessity as of taste. We have already intimated that the stranger was youthful. He had probably beheld some twenty-five or thirty summers, though it may be that premature toils and trials had anticipated the work of time, and made him seem somewhat older than he really was. He had, in the tout ensemble of his face, the appearance of one who had just arrived at the equal maturity of mind and body. His dress was simple, and characterized by as little pretension as could possibly be found in one who was not only young, but evidently in the military. In its material and make, it corresponded with that of the ordinary woodmen of the country. His pantaloons consisted of a dark blue homespun, the legs being wrapped in leggings of a somewhat coarser texture and darker hue. From these the original dye had been obliterated in blotches, here and there; or so obscured by stains from the yellow waters of the swamp, with which the wearer had been so recently familiar, that it would require a very discriminating eye to determine at a glance of what colour they originally were. A hunting-shirt of a deeper blue than that of his under clothes, and perhaps of better material, which reached midway between his hips and knees, completed the essential parts of his costume. This portion of the dress was evidently made with some regard to the shape, and, possibly, the tastes of the wearer; a matter not so certainly clear in the case of the pantaloons. It fitted closely, without a wrinkle, and displayed the symmetry and muscle of his form to the greatest possible advantage. It had been ornamented, it would seem, in better days, with a deep fringe of a complexion somewhat more showy than that of the garment, but of this only a few occasional traces now remained, to testify, much more effectually, to the trials through which it had passed, than its own former brightness and integrity. The little cape which surmounted the coat, and fell back upon the shoulders, had fared rather more fortunately than the rest of the garment, and formed no unseemly finish to the general fitness of the costume; particularly as the wearer, with a better taste than prevailed then, or has prevailed since, had freed his neck from all the buckram restraints of gorget, cravat, or stock—bandagings which fetter the movements of the head, without increasing its dignity or comfort. Enough of the broad sun-burned bosom was revealed by the open shirt before, to display that classic superiority of air of which modern fashions almost wholly deprive the noblest aspect. Upon his head, without shading his brow, rested a cap of otter-skin, rude and ample in its make, the work, most probably, of some favourite slave. A small yellow crescent, serving the purpose of a button, looped VOL. I. 3 up one of the sides in the centre, and might on occasion have sustained a feather. Plain mocasins of buckskin, the original yellow of which had been entirely lost in the more doubtful colours acquired in the swamp, completed the externals of his dress. It may be added that he wore no visible armour; but once, as he stooped to fasten his skiff beside the shore, the butt of a heavy pistol might have been seen protruding from beneath the thick folds of his hunting-shirt. From the unnatural fulness of the opposite breast, it would not be rash to conjecture that this weapon of war was not without its fellow. The stranger ascended from the banks and made his way towards the foot of the heights, that, skirting the northern edges of the Wateree, conduct the eye of the spectator to tke lofty summits of the Santee hills beyond. Here he was joined by another, who had evidently been for some time expecting him. This was a man of middle size, stout, well-made, coarse in feature, strong of limb, active of movement, apparently without the refining influences of society and education, and evidently from the lower orders of the people. Let not this phrase, however, be understood to signify any thing base or unbecoming. Though a poor man, our new acquaintance was not the work of one of nature's journeymen, fashioned when the “master hand” was weary. With head and feet equally bare, he carried the one with a virtuous erectness that could not be well misunderstood; while the other were set down with the freedom and fearlessness of a man conscious that he walked the soil of his native land in the full performance of the equal duties of the patriot and warrior. In his hand he grasped a rifle of immoderate length, the fractured stock of which, lashed together with buckskin thongs, bore tokens of hard usage in more respects than one. The unquestionable poverty of this man's condition—which, indeed, was that of the whole American army—did not seem to have any effect upon his deportment or to give him any uneasiness. He seemed not to know that his garments suffered from any peculiar deficiencies; and never did the language of a light heart declare itself with so little reservation from a blue eye and a good-natured physiognomy. The slight cloud of anxiety which hung at moments above his brow, and which gathered there in consequence of cares of no ordinary kind, could not long, at any time, withstand the buoyant action of the cheerful spirit within. This constantly shone out from his face, and spoke aloud in the clear, ringing tones of his manly yet not unmusical accents. Drawing nigh to our first acquaintance, he grasped his hand with the joyous look and warm manner of one who felt, in the meeting with his comrade, something of a sentiment far stronger than that which governs the ordinary friendships among men. Nor was the manner of his comrade less equivocal, though, perhaps, more quiet and subdued. The behaviour of the twain was that of an intimacy unbroken from boyhood, and made mutually confident by the exercise of trusts which had been kept equally sacred by both the parties. “Well, Clarence, I'm glad you've come. I've been waiting for you a'most two hours. And how goes it in the swamp—and did you git the letters?” “I did: all's well with us—pretty much as when you left. But how with you, Jack? What news do you bring? Is the coast clear—are the light troops gone in?” “Well, I reckon I may say yes. Greene's drawed off from Camden sence the brush at Hobkirk's, and there's no telling jest now which way he's going. As for Marion, you know its never easy to say where to look for him. Lee's gone down on the s'arch somewhere below, and we're all to be up and busy at short notice. I hear tell of great things to do. Our ginral, Sumter, is in motion, and picking up stragglers along the Catawba. I reckon he'll soon be down, and then gallop's the word. Something too I hear of Colonel Tom Taylor at Granby, and—” “Enough, enough, Jack; but you say nothing of Butler and his men? Are they out of the way—are they off? If you know nothing about him—” “Well, I reckon they're at Granby by this time. They've given up the hunt as a bad job. I saw Joe Clinch, one of his troop, only two days ago, and gin him a sort of hint that the chap they were after was more like to be found above the Congaree than in these parts. `For what's to save him,' I said to Joe, `down here in this neighbourhood, where we're all true blue, and he a fire-hot tory?' That was a good reason for Clinch and all his troop, I reckon. They tuk it for one, and by peep of dawn, they were streaking it along the river road. They've got to `Ninety-Six,' by this time, and even if they ha'nt, it's all the same to us. They're out of your way.” “But you did wrong, John Bannister, in saying that Edward Conway was a tory. He himself denies it.” “Well, Clarence, that's true, but I don't see that his denying it makes much difference. It's natural enough that a man should say he's no tory when he's in a whig camp. The vartue of a whole skin depends upon it. There's a chance of broken bones if he says otherwise, which Ned Conway aint a going to resk.” “At least, for my sake, John Bannister, give Edward Conway the benefit of your doubts,” replied the other, with an expression of grave displeasure on his countenance. “We do not know that he is a tory, and the best of men have been the victims of unjust suspicion. I must repeat that you did wrong, if you loved me, in calling him by such a name.” “Ah, Clarence, he's your half-brother, and that's the reason you aint willing to believe any thing agin him; but I'm dub'ous I said nothing worse than the truth when I told Clinch he was a tory. I'm sure the proofs agin him would have hung many a tall chap like himself.” “No more, Bannister—no more,” said the other, gloomily. “It is enough that he is my brother. I am not willing to examine his demerits. I know, and acknowledge to you, that many things in his conduct look suspicious; still I prefer to believe his word—his solemn oath—against all idle reports—reports, which are half the time slanders, and which have destroyed, I verily believe, many lives and characters as worthy as our own. You know that I have no reason to love Edward Conway. We have never been friends, and I have no partialities in his favour. Still, he is the son of my father, and I am bound to defend him while I remain unconvinced of his treachery. I am only afraid that I am too willing to believe what is said in his prejudice. But this I will not believe so long as I can help it. He solemnly assures me he has never joined the tories. He would scarcely swear to a falsehood.” “Well, that's the same question, Clarence, only in another language. The man that would act a lie, wouldn't stop very long to swear to one. Now, if Edward Conway didn't join the tories, who did he join? He didn't join us, did he? Did he swear to that, Clarence?” “No! no! Would to God he could!” “Well, then, what is it that he does say? I'm a-thinking that it's good doctrine to believe, in times like these, that the man that aint with us is agin us. Let him show what he did with himself sence the fall of Charlestown. He warn't there. You don't see his name on the list of prisoners—you don't hear of his parole, and you know he's never been exchanged. It mought be that he went in the British regiments to the West Indies, where they carried a smart chance of our people, that wouldn't ha' got any worse character by taking to the swamps as we did. Does he say that he went there?” “He does not—he declines giving any account of himself, but still denies, most solemnly, that he ever joined the tories.” “I'm mightily afeard, Clarence—now, don't be angry at what I'm going to say—but I'm mightily afeard Edward Conway aint telling you the truth. I wouldn't let him go free—I'd hold him as a sort of prisoner and keep watch upon him. You've saved him when he didn't desarve to be saved by any body, and least of all by you;— and you have a sort of substantial right to do with him jest as you think right and reasonable. I'm for your keeping him, like any other prisoner, and counting him in at the next exchange. He'll go for somebody that'll pull trigger for his country.” “Impossible! How can you give me such counsel? No, no, Jack, let him be all that you think him, the tory and the traitor, still he comes from my father's loins, and though another mother gave us suck, yet I feel that I should defend him as a brother, though he may not be altogether one. He shall suffer no harm at hands of mine.” “Well, I'm sure I don't say he ought. To keep him under a strong thumb and fore-finger—to keep him, as I may say, out of mischief and out of danger till the time of exchange comes round, won't be to do him 3* any harm. It's only one way of feeding a mouth that, mought be, couldn't feed itself so well in these tough times; and taking a little Jamaica from other mouths that mought like it jest as well, and desarve it a great deal better.” “What, Jack, do you begrudge Edward Conway the pitiful fare which we can give him in the swamp? You are strangely altered, Jack, towards him. You were once his playmate in boyhood as well as mine.” “Yes, Clarence, and 'twas then, so far back as them same days of our boyhood—and they were mighty sweet days, I tell you—that I found him out, and l'arned to mistrust him. God knows, Clarence, and you ought to know too, that Jack Bannister would like, if he could, all the flesh and blood in this world that was ever a kin of your'n. I tried mighty hard to love Ned Conway as I loved you, but it was like fighting agin natur'. I tried my best, but couldn't make it out with all my trying; and when I caught him in that business of the dock-tailed horse—” “Do not remind me of these matters now, Jack; I am afraid I remember them too well already.” “You're only too good for him, Clarence. I somehow almost think he aint naturally even a half-brother of your'n any how. You don't look like him; neither eye nor mouth, nor nose nor chin, nor hair nor forehead—all's different as if you had come from any two families that lived at opposite eends of the river, and never seed one another. But, as you say, I won't 'mind you of any matters that you don't want to hear about. Them days is over with me and him, and so I'll shut up on that subject. As for begrudging him the bread and bacon, and the drop of Jamaica, such as we git in the swamp yonder,—well, I won't say nothing, because, you see, I can't somehow think you meant to say what you did. All that I do say, Clarence, is, that I wish I had enough to give him that would persuade him to show clean hands to his friends and blood-kin, and come out for his country, like every man that has a man's love for the airth that raised him.” “I know you mean him no wrong, Jack, and me no pain, when you advise me thus; but my word is pledged to Edward Conway, and I will keep it, though I perish.” “And don't I tell you to keep it, Clarence? You promised to save him from Butler's men, that was a-hunting him, and what better way than to keep him close from sight; for, if he once gits a-going agin, and they find his tracks, it won't be your boldness or my quickness that'll git him into the swamp so easily. If Butler's men hadn't been up-countrymen, that didn't onderstand swamp edication, no how, he wouldn't have had such a quiet time of it where we put him. Well, you've done what you promised, and what, I reckon, every man was bound to do by his blood-kin. You've saved him from his enemies; but there's no need you should give him your best nag that he may gallop full-speed into their pastures. Now, that's what you're a-thinking to do. And why should you? If he aint a tory, and hasn't been one, why shouldn't he be a whig? Why shouldn't he do what he ought to ha' done five years ago—join Sumter's men, or Marion's men, or Pickens' men, or any men that's up for the country—and run his bullets with a tory's name to each. I don't think Ned Conway a coward, no how, and when he won't come out for his country at a pushing time like this, I can't help considering him a mighty suspicious friend.” “Enough, Jack; the more you speak, and I think, of this matter, the more unhappy it makes me,” replied the other. “If I dared to think, I should probably come to more serious conclusions than yourself on the subject of my brother's conduct; which, I confess is altogether inscrutable. I have only one course before me, and that is to set him free, even as he desires, and let him choose his own route henceforward. I have not spared argument to persuade him to our ranks, and he holds out some hopes to me, that when he has finished certain private business he will do so.” “Private business! Lord ha' mercy upon us! How can a body talk of private business, when even throat-cutting is so public?—when there's a sort of Injin bounty for sculps, and it takes more than a man's two hands to keep his own skin and teeth from going off, where they are worth their weight in gold? Private business! Look you, Clarence, did you think to ask him when he had last seen Flora Middleton?” “No, I did not,” returned the other, abruptly, and with some impatience in his manner. “Why should I ask him that? I had no reason to suppose that he had any particular reason for seeing her at this, or at any other time.” “Now, Clarence, you needn't be telling me that, when I know so much better. I know that if he hasn't a reason for seeing her, he's always had a mighty strong wish that way; and as for your own feelings, Lord bless you, Clarence, it's no fault of your'n, if every second man in the regiment don't know the soft place in the colonel's heart by this time, and can't put his finger on it whenever he pleases. If you love Flora Middleton there's no harm in it; and if Edward Conway loves her too—” He paused, and looked at his companion with the air of one who is doubtful of the effect of that which he has already said. “Well! What then?” demanded the other. “Why, only, there's no harm, perhaps, in that either.” “Ay, but there is, John Bannister, and you know it;” cried the other, almost fiercely. “Edward Conway knew that I loved Flora Middleton long before he had ever seen her.” “Very true; but that's no good reason why he shouldn't love her when he did see her, Clarence.” “But it is good reason why he should not seek her with his love.” “I reckon, Clarence, he don't much stand upon such a reason. There's nothing brotherly in love matters, Clarence; and even if there was, Ned Conway is about the last person to make much count of it.” “He does—he shall! Nay, on this point I have his assurance. He tells me that he has not sought her—he has not seen her for months.” “And did Edward Conway really tell you so, Clarence?” “He did—it was almost his last assurance when I left him.” “Then he told you a most crooked and abominable lie. He has seen her within the last three weeks.” “Ha! how know you?” “From little Joe, the blacksmith, that was down by Watson's before it was taken from the British. Little Joe went with him to Briar Park, and saw him and Miss Flora in the piazza together.” The young man clutched the butt of the pistol in his bosom with a convulsive grasp, but soon relaxed it. He struck his forehead, the next moment, with his open palm, then strode away from his companion, as if to conceal the emotion which he could not so easily overcome. “Well,” he exclaimed, returning, “I had a strange fear —I know not why—that there was something insincere in his assurance. He made it voluntarily,—we had not named her,—and even as he spoke, there was a something in his face which troubled me, and made me doubtful of his truth. But he will go too far—he will try the force of blood beyond its patience.” “There's nothing, Clarence, in the shape of licking that sich a person don't desarve. I followed out more of his crooks than one, years ago, when there was no war; and he had all the tricks of a tory even then.” “That he should basely lie to me, and at such a moment! When I had risked life to save him!—When!— but let me not grow foolish. Enough, that I know him and suspect him. He shall find that I know him. He shall see that he cannot again cheat me with loving language and a Judas kiss.” “Ah, Clarence, but you can cheat yourself. He knows how quick you are to believe; and when he puts on them sweet looks, and talks so many smooth words, and makes b'lieve he's all humility, and how sorry he is for what he's done, and how willing he is to do better—and all he wants is a little time—as if ever a man wanted time to get honest in! Look you, Clarence, you're my colonel, and what's more, I'm your friend—you know I love you, Clarence, better than one man ever loved another, and jest as well as Jonathan ever loved David, as we read in the good book; but, with all my love for you, Clarence, d—n my splinters, if you let Ned Conway cheat you any longer with his sweet words and sugar promises, I'll cut loose from you with a jerk that'll tear every j'int out of the socket. I won't be the friend of no man that lets himself be cheated. As for hating Ned Conway, as you sometimes say I do, there, I say, you're clean mistaken. I don't hate him—I mistrust him. I've tried mighty hard to love him, but he wouldn't let me. You know how much I've done to save him from Butler's men; but I saved him on your account, and not because I think he desarves to be saved. I'm dub'ous that he is a tory, and a rank tory too, if the truth was known, jest as they charge it upon him. I'm dub'ous he'll join the British as soon as he can git a chance; and I'm more than dub'ous, that, if you don't git before him to your mother's plantation, and run the niggers into the swamp out of his reach, he'll not leave you the hair of one —he'll have 'em off to Charlestown by some of his fellows, and then to the West Indies, before you can say Jack Robinson, or what's a'most as easy, Jack Bannister. There's another person I think you ought to see about, and that's Miss Flora. Either you love her or you don't love her. Now, if you love her, up and at her at once, with all your teeth set, as if you had said it with an oath; for though I know this aint no time to be a-wiving and a-courting, yet, when the varmints is a-prowling about the poultry-yard, it's no more than sense to look after the speckled hen. Take a fool's wisdom for once, and have an eye to both eends of the road. Go over to the plantation, and when you're there, you can steal a chance to cross over to Middleton's. It's my notion you'll find Ned Conway at one place or t'other.” “I'll think of it,” said Conway, in subdued tones; “meantime, do you take the canoe back to the island and bring him out. The horses are in readiness?” “Yes, behind the hill. I'll bring him out if you say so, Clarence, but it's not too late to think better of it. He's safe, for all parties, where he is.” “No, no, Jack, I've promised him. I'll keep my promise. Let him go. I fear that he has deceived me. I fear that he will still deceive me. Still I will save him from his enemies, and suppress my own suspicions. It will be only the worse for him if he does me wrong hereafter.” “Clarence, if he turns out to be a tory, what'll our men say to hear you harboured him?” “Say!—perhaps, that I am no better.” “No, no! they can't say that—they shan't say it, when Jack Bannister is nigh enough to hear, and to send his hammer into the long jaws that talk such foolishness; but they'll think it mighty strange, Clarence.” “Hardly, Jack, when they recollect that he is my father's son.” “Ah, Lord, there's mighty few of us got brothers in these times in Carolina. A man's best brother now-a-days is the thing he fights with. His best friend is his rifle. You may call his jackknife a first-cousin, and his two pistols his eldest sons; and even then, there's no telling which of them all is going to fail him first, or whether any one among 'em will stick by him till the scratch is over. Edward Conway, to my thinking, Clarence, was never a brother of your'n, if `brother' has any meaning of `friend' in it.” “Enough, enough, Jack. Leave me now and bring him forth. I will do what I promised, whatever may be my doubts. I will guide him on his way, and with this night's work acquit myself of all obligations to him. When we next meet, it shall be on such terms as shall for ever clear up the shadows that stand between us. Away, now!—it will be dark in two hours, and we have little time to waste. The storm which threatens us will be favourable to his flight.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE RETROSPECT.—THE FUGITIVE. The dialogue between the two friends, which has just been given, will convey to the mind of the reader some idea of the situation of the parties. We have not aimed to describe the manner of this dialogue, preferring infinitely that the interlocutors should speak entirely for themselves. It may be stated in this place, however, that, throughout the interview, the sturdy counsellor, whose honest character and warm friendship constituted his perfect claim to speak unreservedly to his superior, betrayed a dogged determination not to be satisfied with the disposition which the latter had resolved to make of one whom he was pleased to consider in some sort a prisoner. On the other hand, the younger of the two, whom we have known by the name of Clarence Conway, and who held a colonel's command over one of those roving bodies of whig militia, which were to be found at this period in every district of the state,—though resolute to release his brother from the honourable custody in which circumstances had placed him, still seemed to regret the necessity by which he was prompted to this proceeding. There were various feelings conflicting for mastery in his bosom. While he did not believe in the charges of political treachery by which his half-brother was stigmatized, he was yet any thing but satisfied that his purposes were politically honest or honourable. Equally dubious with his companion on the subject of Edward Conway's principles, he was yet not prepared to believe in the imputation which had been cast upon his performances. He suspected him, not of fighting for the enemy, but of the meaner and less daring employment, of speculating in the necessities of the country; and, in some way or other, of craftily availing himself of its miseries and wants, to realize that wealth, the passion for which constituted, he well knew, a leading and greedy appetite in the character of his kinsman. Clarence Conway was the younger son of a gentleman who came from the West Indies, bringing with him an only child—then an infant—the fruit of a first marriage with a lady of Barbadoes, who died in bringing it into the world. The graceful form, pleasing manners, and varied intelligence of this gentleman, gained him the favour of a young lady of the Congaree, who became his wife. One son, our hero, was born to this union; and his eyes had scarcely opened upon the light, when his father fell a victim to fever, which he caught in consequence of some rash exposure among the swamps of the low country. The infant, Clarence, became the favourite of his grandparents, by whom he was finally adopted. He thus became the heir of possessions of a vastness and value infinitely beyond those which by the laws of primogeniture, necessarily accrued to his half-brother. The anxiety of Edward Conway to be the actual possessor of his rights, became so obvious to all eyes, that Mrs. Conway yielded him early possession, soon after her husband's death, and retired to one of the plantations which had descended from her father to her son. Edward Conway did not long retain the estate left him by his father. He was sagacious or fortunate enough to sell it, and realize its value in money, before the strifes of the Revolution became inevitable. With the conquest of Carolina by the British, he almost disappeared from sight; but not until himself and half-brother had already come into conflict on grounds which did not involve any reference to the politics of the country. This collision between them was of such a nature—already hinted at in the previous chapter—as to bring into active exercise the anger of the one, and the dissimulation of the other. To Clarence Conway, therefore, the unfrequent appearance of Edward afforded but little discontent. The late return of the latter, under circumstances of suspicion— under imputations of political treachery, and accusations of crime,—now bewildered the more frank and passionate youth, who lamented nothing half so much as to be compelled to call him kinsman. He knew the wilfulness of heart which characterized him, and dreaded lest he should VOL. I. 4 abuse, in a respect purely personal, the freedom which he was about to confer upon him. His own ability to follow, and to watch the object of his suspicions, was very limited at this period. His movements were governed by his military position, by prudence, and certain other relations of a more private nature, which shall be considered as we proceed. With no such restraints as these, and once more safe from the dangers which had compelled him to seek shelter at the hands of his brother in the swamp, the future conduct of Edward Conway filled the mind of Clarence with many apprehensions; the more strongly felt, since his falsehood in a particular respect, had been revealed by his companion. There was, as the latter had phrased it, a weak or tender spot in the bosom of Clarence Conway, which led him to apprehend every thing of evil should Edward prove false to certain pledges which he had voluntarily made, and proceed to a dishonourable use of his liberty. But it was a point of honour with him not to recede from his own pledges, nor to forbear, because of a revival of old suspicions, the performances to which they had bound him. Yet, in the brief hour that followed the departure of Jack Bannister, how much would his young commander have given, could he have taken his counsel— could he have kept, as a prisoner, that person whose passions he well knew, and whose dissimulation he feared. He thus nearly argued himself into the conviction—not a difficult one at that period—that it was his public duty to arrest and arraign, as a criminal to his country, the person against whom the proofs were so strikingly presumptive. As he reflected upon this subject, it seemed to astonish even himself at the degree of criminality which he was now willing to attach to his kinsman's conduct. How was it that he had become so generally suspected? How easy, if he were able, to prove his fidelity! Why was he absent from the field? Where had he been? Though proof was wanting to show that he had been active in the British cause, yet none was necessary to show that he had been wholly inactive for the American. More than once, in the interval which followed from the first futile, to the final and successful invasion of the enemy, had Clarence sought him, to stimulate his patriotism, and urge him to the field. All their conferences were devoted to this object; the younger brother sometimes assuming a language in the controversy, which nothing but the purity of his patriotism and his own obvious disinterestedness, could have justified from the lips of a younger brother. But his exhortations fell upon unheeding ears—his arguments in barren places. There were no fruits. Edward Conway contrived with no small degree of art to conceal his real sentiments, at a time when the great body of the people were only too glad to declare themselves, either on one side or the other. Subsequently, when the metropolis had fallen, the same adroitness was exercised to enable him to escape from the consequences of committal to either. How this was done —by what evasions, or in what manner—Clarence Conway was at a loss to understand. As the war proceeded, and the invasion of the colony became general, the active events of the conflict, the disorders of the country, the necessity of rapid flight, from point to point, of all persons needing concealment, served to prevent the frequent meeting of the kinsmen;—and circumstances, to which we have already adverted, not to speak of the equivocal political position of the elder brother, contributed to take from such meetings what little gratification they might have possessed for either party. Whenever they did meet, the efforts of Clarence were invariably made, not to find out the mode of life which the other pursued, but simply to assure himself that it was right and honourable. To this general object all his counsels were addressed; but he was still compelled to be content with a general but vague assurance from the other, that it was so. Still there was one charge which Edward Conway could not escape. This was the omission of that duty to his country, which, in a season of invasion, cannot be withheld without dishonouring either the manhood or the fidelity of the citizen. Clarence was not willing to ascribe to treachery this inaction; yet he could not, whenever he gave any thought to the subject, attribute it to any other cause. He knew that Edward was no phlegmatic; he knew that he was possessed of courage—nor courage merely; he knew that a large portion of audacity and impulse entered into his character. That he was active in some cause, and constantly engaged in some business, Edward Conway did not himself seek to deny. What that business was, however, neither the prayers nor the exhortations of Clarence and his friends could persuade him to declare; while the discovery of a circumstance, by the latter, which led him to apprehend the interference of the former in another field than that of war, contributed still farther to estrange them from each other. Enough now has been said to render the future narrative easy of comprehension. While, with vexing and bitter thoughts, Clarence Conway awaited the progress of his companion, with the fugitive whom he had given into his charge, Supple Jack (for that was the nom de guerre conferred by his comrades upon the worthy woodman, in compliment to certain qualities of muscle which made his feats sometimes remarkable in the course of their forest adventures) penetrated into the recesses of the swamp, with a degree of diligence which by no means betokened his own disposition of mind in regard to the particular business upon which he went. But Supple Jack was superior to all that sullenness which goes frowardly to the task, because it happens to disapprove it. As a friend, he counselled without fear; as a soldier, he obeyed without reluctance. He soon reached the little island on the edge of the Wateree river, where Clarence Conway had concealed his kinsman from the hot hunt which had pursued him to that neighbourhood. So suddenly and silently did he send his canoe forward, that her prow struck the roots of the tree, at whose base the fugitive reclined, before he was conscious of her approach. The latter started hastily to his feet, and the suspicious mood of Supple Jack was by no means lessened, when he beheld him thrust into his bosom a paper upon which he had evidently been writing. To the passing spectator Edward Conway might have seemed to resemble his half-brother. They were not unlike in general height, in muscle, and in size. The air of Clarence may have been more lofty; but that of Edward was equally firm. But the close observer would have concurred with the woodman, that they were, as kinsmen, utterly unlike in almost every other respect. The aspect of Clarence Conway was bright and open, like that of an unclouded sky; that of Edward was dark, reserved, and lowering. There was a shyness and a suspiciousness of manner in his glance and movement; and, while he spoke, the sentences were prolonged, as if to permit as much premeditation as possible between every syllable. His smile had in it a something sinister, which failed to invite or soothe the spectator. It was not the unforced expression of a mind at ease,—of good-humour,—of a heart showing its clear depths to the glances of the sun. It was rather the insidious lure of the enchanter, who aims to dazzle and beguile. As such only did our woodman seem to understand it. The strained and excessive cordiality of Edward Conway, as he bounded up at his approach,—the hearty grasp of the hand which he extended,—met with little answering warmth on the part of the former. His eye encountered the glance of the fugitive without fear, but with cold reserve; his hand was quickly withdrawn from the close clutch which received it; and the words with which he acknowledged and answered the other's salutation were as few, and such only, as were unavoidable. The fugitive saw the suspicion, and felt the coldness with which he was encountered. Without seeming offended, he made it the subject of immediate remark. “Ha, Jack, how is this? Friends—old friends—should not meet after such a fashion. Wherefore are you so cold? Do you forget me? Have you forgotten that we were boys together, Jack,—playmates for so many happy years?” “No, no! I hain't forgotten any thing, Edward Conway, that a plain man ought to remember;” replied the woodman, taking literally the reproach of his companion. “But we ain't boys and playmates any longer, Edward Conway. We are men now, and these are no times for play of any sort; and there's a precious few among us that know with whom we can play safely, nowadays, without finding our fingers in the cat's mouth.” “True enough, Jack; but what's true of other people needn't be true of us. Times change; but they shouldn't change friends. We are the same, I trust, that we have ever been to one another.” This was said with an eager insinuating manner, and the hand of Conway was a second time extended to take that of the other. But without regarding the movement, Supple Jack replied with a blunt resoluteness of demeanour, 4* which would most effectually have rebuffed any less flexible spirit: “I reckon we aint, Edward Conway, and it's of no use to beat about the bush to find out what to say. Times change and we change, and it's onnatural to expect to keep the same in all weathers. I know there's a mighty great change in me, and I'm thinking there's the same sort of change going on in a'most every body. I used to be a quiet peaceable sort of person, that wouldn't hurt a kitten; and now I'm wolfish more than once a week, and mighty apt to do mischief when I feel so. I used to believe that whatever a pair of smooth lips said to me was true, and now I suspicions every smooth speaker I meet, as if he was no better than a snake in the grass. 'Taint in my natur to keep the same always any more than the weather, and I tell you plainly I'm quite another sort of person from the boy that used to play with you, and Clarence Conway, long time ago.” “Ah, Jack, but you hav'n't changed to him—you are the same to Clarence Conway as ever.” “Yes, bless God for all his marcies, that made me love the boy when he was a boy, and kept the same heart in me after he came to be a man. I aint ashamed to say that I love Clarence the same as ever, since he never once, in all my dealings with him, boy and man, ever gave me reason to mistrust him. He's mighty like an oak in two ways—he's got the heart of one, and there's no more bend in him than in an oak.” The cheek of the fugitive was flushed as he listened to this simple and direct language. He was indiscreet enough to press the matter farther. “But why should you distrust me, Jack Bannister. You have known me quite as long as you have known Clarence, we have played as much together—” “Ay!” exclaimed the other abruptly, and with a startling energy. “But we hav'n't fou't together, and bled together, and slept together, and starved together, Edward Conway. You hav'nt been so ready as Clarence to come out for your country. Now I've starved in his company, and run, and fou't, and been with him in all sorts of danger, and he's never been the first to run, and he's always been the last to feel that he was afraid, and to show that he was hungry. For nine months we had but one blanket between us, and that was half burnt up from sleeping too close to the ashes one cold night last Christmas. It's these things that made us friends from the beginning, and it's these things that keep us friends till now. You don't seem altogether to remember, that you and me were never friends, Edward Conway, even when we were playmates; and the reason was I always mistrusted you. Don't think I mean to hurt your feelings by telling you the truth. You're a sort of prisoner, you see, and it would be mighty ongenteel for me to say any thing that mought give offence, and I ax pardon if I does; but as I tell you, I mistrusted you from the beginning, and I can't help telling you that I mistrust you to the end. You ha'n't got the sort o' ways I like, and when that's the case, it's no use to strain one's natur' to make a liking between feelings that don't seem to fit. Besides, you have a bad standing in the country. These men of Butler's swear agin you by another name, and it looks mighty suspicious when we come to consider that none of the whigs have any thing to say in your behalf.” “One thing is certain, John Bannister,” replied the fugitive composedly; “you at least preserve your ancient bluntness. You speak out your mind as plainly as ever.” “I reckon its always best,” was the answer. “Perhaps so, though you do me injustice, and your suspicions are ungenerous. It is unfortunate for me that, for some little time longer I must submit to be distrusted. The time will come, however, and I hope very soon, when you will cease to regard me with doubt or suspicion.” “Well, I j'in my hope to your'n in that matter; but till that time comes round, Edward Conway, I mought as well say to you that we are not friends, and I don't think it 'ill make us any nearer even if you was to prove that you're no tory. For why,—I know that you're no friend to Clarence, for all he's done for you.” “Ha, Bannister—how—what know you?” “Enough to make me say what I'm saying. Now, you hear me, jest once, for the first and last time that I may ever have a chance of letting you see my mind. I know enough to know that you've been a-working agin Clarence, and I suspicions you ha'n't done working agin him. Now, this is to let you onderstand that Jack Bannister has ne'er an eye in his head that do'n't watch for his friend and agin his enemy: and I tell you, all in good natur', and without meaning any malice, that, whatever harm you do to him, that same harm I'll double and treble to you, though I wait 'till the worst weather, and walk on bloody stumps, to do it. I suspicions you, Edward Conway, and I give you fair warning, I'll be at your heels, like a dog that never barks to let the world know which way he's running.” “A fair warning enough, Bannister,” replied the fugitive with recovered composure, and a moderate show of dignity. “To resent your language, at this time, would be almost as foolish as to endeavour to prove that your suspicions of me are groundless. I shall not feel myself less manly or less innocent by forbearing to do either.” “Well, that's jest as you think proper, Edward Conway; I must ax your pardon ag'in for saying rough things to a man that's a sort of prisoner, but I'm thinking it's always the cleanest play to speak the truth when you're forced to it. You've been talking at me ever since the time I helped Clarence to git you into the swamp, as if I had been some old friend of your'n, and it went agin me to stand quiet and hear you all the time, and not set you right on that matter. Now, as the thing's done, with your leave we'll say no more about it. My orders from the colonel are to carry you out of the swamp, so you'll make ready as soon as you can, for there's precious little of daylight left for a mighty dark sort of navigation.” “And where is he—where do you take me?” demanded the fugitive. “Well, it's not in my orders to let you know any more than I've told you: only I may say you don't go out exactly where you came in.” “Enough, sir. I presume that my brother's commands will ensure me a safe guidance? I am ready to go with you.” This was said with that air of resentment which amply proved to the woodman that his blunt freedoms had been sensibly felt. He smiled only at the distrust which the words of the fugitive seemed to betray, and the haughtiness of his manner appeared rather to awaken in the woodman a pleasurable emotion. “Well,” he muttered half aloud as he prepared to throw the boat off from her fastenings; “well, it's not onreasonable that he should be angry. I don't know but I should like him the better if he would throw off his coat and back all his sly doings at the muzzle of the pistol. But I have no patience with any thing that looks like a sneak. It's bad enough to be dodging with an enemy, but to dodge when a friend's looking after you, is a sort of sport I consider mighty onbecoming in a white man. It's nigger natur', and don't shame a black skin, but— well, you're ready, Mr. Edward? Jest take your seat in the bottom, and keep steady. It's a ticklish sort of navigation we've got before us, and our dug-out aint much more heavier than a good sized calabash. She'll swim if we're steady, but if you dodge about we'll sp'il our leggins, and mought be, have to swim for it. Steady, so. Are you right, sir?” “Steady—all right!” was the calm, low response of the fugitive, as the canoe darted through the lagune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE KINSMEN. The boat, under the adroit management of Supple Jack, soon reached the shore where Clarence Conway awaited them. Standing side by side, there was little obvious difference between the persons of the kinsmen. They were both equally tall, strongly made, and symmetrical—each had the same general cast of countenance—the hair was not unlike; the complexion of Edward was darker than that of Clarence. The difference between them, physically, if not so obvious, was yet singularly marked and substantial. There was that in the expression of their several faces, which, to the nice physiognomical critic, did not inaptly illustrate the vital differences in the two characters as they will be found to display themselves in the progress of this narrative. The forehead and chin of the former were much smaller than those of the younger. The cheek-bones were higher; the lips, which in Clarence Conway were usually compressed, giving an air of decision to his mouth which approached severity, were, in the case of Edward, parted into smiles, which were only too readily and too easily evoked, not, sometimes, to awaken doubts of their sincerity in the mind of the spectator. Some well-defined lines about the upper lip and corners of the mouth, which signified cares and anxieties, tended still more to make doubtful the prompt smile of the wearer. The difference of five years—for that period of time lay between their several ages—had added a few wrinkles to the cheeks and brow of the elder, which no where appeared upon the face of the younger. A conscience free from reproach, had probably saved him from tokens which are quite as frequently the proofs of an ill-ordered life as of age and suffering. Some other leading differences between the two might be traced out by a close observer, and not the least prominent of these, exhibited itself at the moment of their present meeting in the over-acted kindness and extreme courtesy of the fugitive kinsman. His sweet soft tones of conciliation, his studied gentleness of accent, and the extreme humility of his gesture— all appeared in large contrast with the simple, unaffected demeanour of the younger. His feelings were all too earnest for mannerism of any sort; and motioning Jack Bannister aside, he met his half-brother with an air full of direct purpose, and a keenly awakened consciousness of the dark doubts renewed in his mind upon that mystery which rose up like a wall between them. It was difficult to say, while Edward Conway was approaching him, whether sorrow or anger predominated in his countenance. The face of the fugitive beamed with smiles, and his hand was extended. His hand remained untaken, however, and his eye shrunk from the encounter with that searching glance which awaited him in the eye of Clarence. A slight suffusion passed over his cheek, and there was a tremor in his voice as he spoke, which might be natural to the resentment which he must have felt, but which he showed no other disposition to declare. “So cold to me, Clarence? What now should awaken your displeasure? You have behaved nobly in this business—do not send me from you in anger!” “I have behaved only as a brother, Edward Conway. Would that you could feel like one! You have again deceived me!” was the stern, accusing answer. “Deceived you!” was the reply, and the eye of the speaker wandered from the strong glance of his kinsman, and his lips whitened as he spoke; “how, Clarence—how have I deceived you?” “But this day you assured me, on your honour, that you had not sought Flora Middleton since my last conference with you on the subject. I now know that you have been at Briar Park within the last three weeks.” The practised cunning of the worldling came to the relief of the accused, and Edward Conway availed himself of one of those petty evasions to which none but the mean spirit is ever willing to resort. “Very true, Clarence, but I did not seek Flora in going there. I happened to be in the neighbourhood at nightfall, and saw no good reason for avoiding a good supper and a comfortable bed, which I knew the hospitalities of Briar Park would always afford me. I did go there—that is true—saw Flora and all the family—but it is nevertheless equally true, that in going there I did not seek her.” “But you withheld the fact of your being there, Edward Conway, and left the impression on my mind that you had not seen her.” “I did not seek to convey such an impression, Clarence; I simply spoke to the point, and spoke with literal exactitude.” “You have a legal proficiency in language;” was the sarcastic comment. “But for this I should probably have heard the whole truth. What good reason was there why you should be so partial in your revelations? Why did you not tell me all?” “To answer you frankly, Clarence,” replied the other with the air of a man unbuttoning his bosom to the examination of the world—“I found you jealous and suspicious on this subject—in just the mood to convert the least important circumstance into a cause of doubt and dissatisfaction; and, therefore, I withheld from you a fact which, however innocent in itself, and unworthy of consideration, I was yet well aware, in your tone of mind, would assume an importance and character which justly it could not merit. Besides, Clarence, there were so many subjects of far more interest to my mind, of which we had no speech, that I did not care to dwell upon the matter longer than was necessary. You forget, Clarence, that I had not seen you for months before this meeting.” The suspicions of the younger were in no respect disarmed or lessened by this explanation. Edward Conway had somewhat overshot his mark when he spoke so slightingly of a subject to which Clarence attached so high an importance. The latter could not believe in the indifference which the other expressed in reference to one so dear to himself as Flora Middleton; and, in due degree as he felt the probability that so much merit as he esteemed that maiden to possess, could not fail to awaken the tender passion in all who beheld her, so was he now inclined to consider the declaration of his kinsman as an hypocrisy equally gross and shallow. He resolved, internally, that he should neither deceive his judgment nor disarm his watchfulness; that, while he himself forbore reproaches of every sort, which, indeed, at that moment would have seemed ungenerous and ungracious, he would endeavour to maintain a surveillance over his rival's movements, which would at least defeat such of his machinations as might otherwise tend to beguile from himself the affections of the beloved object. The closing words of Edward Conway suggested a natural change of the subject, of which Clarence quickly availed himself. “You remind me, Edward Conway, that though we have spoken of various and interesting subjects, you have not yet given me the information which I sought, on any. The one most important to both of us, Edward Conway— to our father's family, to the name we bear, and the position we should equally sustain, as well to the past as to the future, in the eye of our country—is that of your present public course. On that subject you have told me nothing. Of your position in this conflict I know nothing; and what little reaches my ears from the lips of others, is painfully unfavourable. Nay, more, Edward Conway, I am constrained to think, and I say it in bitterness and sadness, that what you have said, in reply to my frequent and earnest inquiries, on this point, has seemed to me intended rather to evade than to answer my demands. I cannot divest myself of the conviction that you have spoken on this subject with as careful a suppression of the whole truth, as this morning when you gave me the assurance with regard to Flora Middleton.” A heavy cloud darkened, though for a moment only, the face of the elder Conway. “There are some very strong prejudices against me in your mind, Clarence, or it would not be difficult for you to understand, how I might very naturally have secrets which should not be revealed, and yet be engaged in no practices which would either hurt my own, or the honour of my family.” “This I do not deny, Edward, however suspicious it may seem that such secrets should be withheld from an only brother, whose faith you have never yet found reason VOL. I. 5 to suspect; whose prudence you have never found occasion to distrust. But I do not ask for any of your secrets. I should scorn myself for ever did I feel a single desire to know that which you have any good reason to withhold from me. It is only that I may defend you from injustice—from slander—from the suspicions of the true and the worthy,—that I would be fortified by a just knowledge of your objects and pursuits. Surely, there can be no good reason to withhold this knowledge, if what you do is sanctioned by propriety and the cause for which we are all in arms.” “It is sanctioned by the cause for which we are in arms;” replied the other, hastily. “Have I not assured you that I am no traitor—that my fidelity to my country is not less pure and perfect than your own? The slanderer will defame and the credulous will believe, let us labour as we may. I take no heed of these—I waste no thought on such profitless matters; and you, Clarence, will save yourself much pain, and me much annoying conjecture, if you will resolve to scorn their consideration with myself, and cast them from your mind. Give them no concern. Believe me to be strangely and awkwardly placed; but not criminal—not wilfully and perversely bent on evil. Is not this enough? What more shall I say? Would you have me—your elder brother—bearing the same name with yourself—declare to you, in words, that I am not the black-hearted, blood-thirsty, reckless monster, which these wide-mouthed creatures, these blind mouths and bitter enemies, proclaim me?” “But why are these men of Butler your enemies? They are not the enemies of your country.” “I know not that,” said the other hastily. “Your doubt does them gross injustice;” replied Clarence Conway, with increased earnestness; “they are known men—tried and true—and whatever may be their excesses and violence, these are owing entirely to the monstrous provocation they have received. How can it be, Edward, that you have roused these men to such a degree of hostility against yourself. They bear to you no ordinary hate—they speak of you in no ordinary language of denunciation—” “My dear Clarence,” said the other, “you seem to forget all the while, that they never spoke of me at all— certainly not by name. They know me not—they have most assuredly confounded me with another. Even if I were indeed the person whom they hate, to answer your questions would be no easy matter. As well might I undertake to show why there are crime and injustice in the world, as why there are slander and suspicion. These are plants that will grow, like joint-grass, in every soil, weed and work at them as you may.” “It is nevertheless exceedingly strange, Edward,” was the musing answer of the still unsatisfied Clarence; “it is strange how any set of men should make such a mistake.” “The strangest thing of all is, that my own brother should think it so. Why should you?” “Should I not?” “Wherefore?—You cannot believe that I am, indeed, what they allege me to be—the chief of the Black Riders—that dreaded monster—half man, half dragon— who slays the men, swallows the children, and flies off with the damsels. Ha! ha! ha! Really, Clarence, I am afraid you are as credulous now at twenty-five as you were at five.” “It is not that I believe, Edward Conway. If I did, the name of my father, which you bear, had not saved your life. But, why, again, are you suspected? Suspicion follows no actions that are not doubtful—it dogs no footsteps which are straightforward—it haunts no character, the course of which has been direct and unequivocal? My unhappiness is that you have made yourself liable to be confounded with the criminal, because you have not been seen with the innocent. You are not with us, and the natural presumption is that you are with our enemies.” “I should not care much for the idle gabble of these country geese, Clarence, but that you should echo their slanders—that you should join in the hiss.” “I do not—all I demand of you is that confidence which would enable me to silence it.” “As well attempt to silence the storm. The attempt would be idle; and, if made, where should we begin? What suspicion must I first dissipate? Whose poisonous breath must I first encounter? This story of the Black Riders, for example—do you really believe, Clarence, in the alleged existence of this banditti?” “I do!—I cannot believe otherwise.” “Impossible! I doubt it wholly. These dastardly fellows of Butler, have fancied half the terrors they describe. Their fears have magnified their foes, and I make no question they have slandered as civil a set of enemies as ever had a professional sanction for throat-cutting. Really, Clarence, the very extravagance of these stories should save you from belief; and I must say, if you do believe, that a little more of the brotherly love which you profess, should keep you from supposing me to be the savage monster of whom they give such horrid traits in the chief of this Black banditti. My very appearance—in our youth, Clarence, considered not very much unlike your own—should save me from these suspicions. See!—my skin is rather fair than dark; and as for the mass of hair which is said to decorate the chin, and the black shock which surrounds the face of the formidable outlaw—none who looks at my visage will fancy that Essau could ever claim me for his kinsman. My vanity, indeed, is somewhat touched, Clarence, that my smooth visage should suffer such cruel misrepresentation.” And as the speaker concluded this rhapsody, his eye suddenly wandered from that of the person he addressed, and rested upon the belt which encircled his own body— a belt of plain black leather, secured by an ordinary iron buckle, painted of the same colour, and freshly varnished. An uneasy upward glance, at this moment, encountered that of his kinsman, whose eyes had evidently followed his own, to the examination of the same object. In this single glance and instant, it seemed that the moral chasm which had always existed between their souls, had yawed wider and spread farther than before. There was a mutual instinct where there was no mutual sympathy. The disquiet of the one, and the doubts of the other, were re-awakened; and though neither spoke, yet both understood the sudden difficulties of farther speech between them. Another voice, at this moment, broke the silence, which it did not however relieve of any of that painful pressure which the interview possessed over both the interested parties. The impatience of the worthy woodman had brought him sufficiently nigh to hear some of the last words of the elder kinsman. “Well,” said he, bluntly, “if long talking can make any case cl'ar, then it's pretty sartin, Edward Conway, that they've mightily belied you. What you say is very true about skin, and face, and complexion, and all that. Naterally, you han't no great deal of beard, and your shock, as it stands, wouldn't be a sarcumstance alongside of the colonel's or my own. But I've hearn of contrivances to help natur in sich a matter. I've hearn of livin' men, and livin' women too, that dressed themselves up in the sculps of dead persons, and made a mighty pretty figure of hair for themselves, when, naterally, they had none. Now, they do say, that the Black Riders does the same thing. Nobody that I've ever hearn speak of them, ever said that the sculps was nateral that they had on; and the beards, too, would come and go, jist according to the company they want to keep. It's only a matter of ten days ago—the time you may remember by a mighty ugly run you had of it from these same boys of Butler—that I was a-going over the same ground, when, what should I happen to see in the broad track but one of these same movable sculps—the sculp for the head and the sculp for the chin, and another sculp that don't look altogether so nateral, that must ha' gone somewhere about the mouth, though it must ha' been mighty onpleasant a-tickling of the nostrils; for you see, if I knows any thing of human natur, or beast natur, this sculp come, at first, from the upper side of a five year old fox-squirrel, one of the rankest in all the Santee country. I know by the feel somewhat, and a little more by the 5* smell. Now, Mr. Edward Conway, if you'll jist look at these here fixin's, you won't find it so hard to believe that a fair skinned man mout wear a black sculp and a mighty dark complexion underneath, if so be the notion takes him. Seein's believing. I used to think, before we went out, that it was all an old woman's story, but as sure as a gun, I found these sarcumstances, jist as you see 'em, on the broad path down to the Wateree; and I reckon that's a strong sarcumstance in itself, to make me think they was made for something, and for somebody to wear. But that's only my notion. I reckon it's easy enough, in these times, for every man to find a different way of thinking when he likes to.” The articles described by the woodman were drawn from his bosom as he spoke, and displayed before the kinsmen. The keen eyes of Clarence, now doubly sharpened by suspicion, seemed disposed to pierce into the very soul of Edward Conway. He, however, withstood the analysis with all the calm fortitude of a martyr. He examined the several articles with the manner of one to whom they were entirely new and strange; and when he had done, he quietly remarked to the deliberate woodman, that he had certainly produced sufficient evidence to satisfy him, if indeed he were not satisfied before, “that a man, disposed to adopt a plan of concealment and disguise, could readily find, or make, the materials to do so.” “But this, Clarence,” said he, turning to his kinsman, “this has nothing to do with what I was saying of myself. It does not impair the assurance which I made you—” Clarence Conway, who had been closely examining the articles, without heeding his brother, demanded of the woodman why he had not shown them to him before. “Well, colonel, you see I didn't find them ontil the second day after the chase, when you sent me on the scout along the hills.” “Enough!—Bring up the horses.” “Both?” asked the woodman, with some anxiety. “Yes! I will ride a little way with my brother.” The horses were brought in a few moments from the mouth of a gorge which ran between the hills at the foot of which they stood. The promptness of the woodman's movements prevented any conversation, meanwhile, between the kinsmen; nor did either of them appear to desire it. The soul of Clarence was full of a new source of disquiet and dread; while the apprehensions of Edward Conway, if entirely of another sort, were yet too active to permit of his very ready speech. As the kinsmen were preparing to mount, Supple Jack interposed, and drew his superior aside. “Well, what's the matter now?” demanded Clarence impatiently. “Speak quickly, Jack—the storm is at hand—the rain is already falling.” “Yes, and that's another reason for your taking to the swamp ag'in. In three hours the hills will tell a story of every step that your horse is taking.” “Well, what of that?” “Why, matter enough, if the tories are on the look out for us, which I'm dub'ous is pretty much the case. I didn't altogether like the signs I fell in with on the last scout, and if so be that Edward Conway is one of these Black Riders, then it's good reason to believe they'll be looking after him where they lost him.” “Pshaw, no more of this;” said the other angrily. “Well, Clarence, you may `pshaw' it to me as much as you please, only I'm mighty sartain, in your secret heart, you don't `pshaw' it to yourself. It's a strange business enough, and it's not onreasonable in me to think so—seeing what I have seen, and knowing what I know. Now that Butler's boys are gone upwards, these fellows will swarm thick as grasshoppers in all this country; and it's my notion, if you will go, that you should keep a sharp eye in your head, and let your dogs bark at the first wink of danger. I'm dub'ous you're running a mighty great risk on this side of the Wateree. There's no telling where Marion is jist at this time; and there's a rumour that Watson's on the road to j'in Rawdon. Some say that Rawdon's going to leave Camden, and call in his people from Ninety-Six and Augusta; and if so, this is the very part of the country where there's the best chance of meeting him and all of them. I wouldn't ride far, Clarence; and I'd ride fast; and I'd git back as soon as horseflesh could bring me. Sorrel is in full blood now, and he'll show the cleanest heels in the country, at the civillest axing of the spur.” “You are getting as timid, Jack, as you are suspicious,” said the youth kindly, and with an effort at composure, which was not successful. “Age is coming upon you, and I fear, before the campaign is over, you'll be expecting to be counted among the non-combatants. Don't fear for me, Jack; I will return before midnight. Keep up your scout, and get a stouter heart at work— you couldn't have a better one.” “That's to say, Clarry, that I'm a darn'd good-natered fool for my pains. I understand you—” The rest was lost to the ears of Clarence Conway, in the rush of his own and the steed of his companion. “But, fool or not, I'll look after you, as many a fool before has looked after a wiser man, and been in time to save him when he couldn't save himself. As for you, Ned Conway,” he continued in brief soliloquy, and with a lifted finger, “you may draw your skirts over the eyes of Clarence, but it'll take thicker skirts than yourn to blind Jack Bannister. You couldn't do it altogether when I was a boy—it'll be a mighty onbecoming thing to me, now that I'm a man, if I should let you be any more successful. Well, here we stand. The thing's to be done; the game's to be played out; and the stakes. Ned Conway, must be my head agin yourn. The game's a fair one enough, and the head desarves to lose it, that can't keep its place on the shoulders where God put it.” With this conclusive philosophy, the scout tightened his belt about his waist, threw up his rifle, the flint and priming of which he carefully examined, then, disappearing among the stunted bushes that grew beside the swamp thicket, he soon after emerged, leading a stout Choctaw pony, which had been contentedly ruminating among the cane-tops. Mounting this animal, which was active and sure-footed, he set off in a smart canter in the track pursued by his late companions, just as the rainstorm, which had been for some time threatening, began to discharge the hoarded torrents of several weeks upon the parched and thirsting earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE BLACK RIDERS. While the kinsmen were about to leave the banks of the Wateree, for the Santee hills beyond, there were other parties among those hills, but a few miles distant, preparing to move down, on the same road, towards the Wateree. The eye of the skulking woodman may have seen, towards nightfall, a motley and strange group of horsemen, some sixty or seventy in number, winding slowly adown the narrow gorges, with a degree of cautious watchfulness, sufficient to make them objects of suspicion, even if the times were not of themselves enough to render all things so. The unwonted costume of these horsemen was equally strange and discouraging. They were dressed in complete black—each carried broadsword and pistols, and all the usual equipments of the well-mounted dragoon. The belt around the waist, the cap which hung loosely upon the brow; the gloves, the sash—all were distinguished by the same gloomy aspect. Their horses alone, various in size and colour, impaired the effect of this otherwise general uniformity. Silently they kept upon their way, like the shadows of some devoted band of the olden time, destined to reappear, and to reoccupy, at certain periods of the night, the scenes in which they fought and suffered. Their dark, bronzed visages, at a nearer approach, in no wise served to diminish the general severity of their appearance. Huge, bushy beards, hung from every chin, in masses almost weighty enough to rival the dense forests which are seen at the present day, in the same region, by a more pacific people. The moustache ran luxuriant above the mouth, while a tuft below, like that which decorates the turkey, emulated the thickness, if not the extent, of this imperial treasure, in that pompous bird. Some of these decorations were, doubtlessly, like those which became the spoil of our worthy woodman in a previous chapter, of artificial origin; but an equal number were due to the bounteous indulgence of Dame Nature herself. Of the troop in question, and their aspects, something more might be said. They had evidently, most of them, seen service in the “imminent deadly breach.” Ugly scars were conspicuous on sundry faces, in spite of the extensive foliage of beard, which storve vainly to conceal them; and the practised ease of their horsemanship, the veteran coolness which marked their deliberate and watchful movements, sufficiently declared the habitual and well-appointed soldier. Still, there was not so much of that air of military subordination among them which denotes the regular school of warlike exercises. They seemed to be men, to whom something of discipline was relaxed in consideration of other more valuable qualities of valour and forward enterprise, for which they might be esteemed. Though duly observant not to do any thing which might yield advantage to an enemy, prowling in the neighbourhood, still, this caution was not so much the result of respect for their leader, as the natural consequence of their own experience, and the individual conviction of each of what was due to the general safety. They were not altogether silent as they rode, and when they addressed their superiors, there was none of that nice and blind deference upon which military etiquette, among all well-ordered bodies of men, so imperatively insists. The quip and crack were freely indulged in—the ribald jest was spoken; and, if the ribald song remained unsung, it was simply because of a becoming apprehension that its melodies might reach other ears than their own. Their leader, if he might be so considered, to whom they turned for the small amount of guidance which they seemed to need, was scarcely one of the most attractive among their number. He was a short, thick set, dark-looking person, whose stern and inflexible features were never lightened unless by gleams of anger and ferocity. He rode at their head, heard in silence the most that was said by those immediately about him, and if he gave any reply, it was uttered usually in a cold, conclusive monosyllable. His dark eye was turned as frequently upward to the lowering skies as along the path he travelled. Sometimes he looked back upon his troop—and occasionally halted at the foot of the hill till the last of his band had appeared in sight above. His disposition to taciturnity was not offensive to those to whom he permitted a free use of that speech in which he did not himself indulge; and without heeding his phlegm, his free companions went on without any other restraint than arose from their own sense of what was due to caution in an enemy's country. Beside the leader, at moments, rode one who seemed to be something of a favourite with him, and who did not scruple, at all times, to challenge the punctual attention of his superior. He was one— perhaps, the very youngest of the party—whose quick, active movements, keen eyes, and glib utterance, declared him to belong to the class of subtler spirits who delight to manage the more direct, plodding, and less ready of their race. It is not improbable that he possessed some such influence over the person whom we have briefly described, of which the latter was himself totally unconscious. Nothing in the deportment of the former would have challenged a suspicion of this sort. Though he spoke freely and familiarly, yet his manner, if any thing, was much more respectful than that generally of his companions. A close observer, the unquiet glances of his superior, had not escaped his observation. He rode up, carefully restraining his steed a quarter in the rear, and with a short broken cough, obviously intended to preface the comment which he meant to offer, he thus remarked on the unfailing topic. “We are like to have the storm on our backs, lieutenant, before we can get to a place of shelter; and I'm thinking if we don't look out for quarters before it comes down in real earnest, there'll be small chance of our finding our way afterward. The night will be here in two hours, and a mighty dark one it will be, I'm thinking.” The lieutenant looked forward, and upward, and around him, and a slight grunt, which was half a sigh, seemed to acknowledge the truth of the other's observations. “I doubt,” continued the first speaker, “if our drive to-day will be any more lucky than before. I'm afraid it's all over with the captain.” Another grunt in the affirmative; and the subordinate proceeded with something more of confidence. “But there's no need that we should keep up the hunt in such a storm as is coming on. Indeed, there's but little chance of finding any body abroad but ourselves in such weather. I'm thinking, lieutenant, that it wouldn't be a bad notion to turn our heads and canter off to old Muggs' at once.” “Old Muggs! why how far d'ye think he's off?” “Not three miles, as I reckon. We've gone about seven from Cantey's, he's only eight to the right, and if we take a short cut that lies somewhere in this quarter— I reckon I can find it soon—we'll be there in a short half hour.” “Well! you're right—we'll ride to Muggs'. There's no use keeping up this cursed hunt and no fun in it.” “Yes, and I reckon we can soon make up our minds to get another captain.” A smirk of the lips, which accompanied this sentence, was intended to convey no unpleasant signification to the ears of his superior. “How, Darcy—how is it—have you sounded them? What do they say now?” demanded the latter with sudden earnestness. “Well, lieutenant, I reckon we can manage it pretty much as we please. That's my notion.” “You think so? Some of them have a strange liking for Morton.” “Yes, but not many, and they can be cured of that.” “Enough, then, till we get to Muggs'. Then we can talk it over. But beware of what you say to him. Muggs is no friend of mine, you know.” “Nor is he likely to be, so long as he wears that scar on his face in token that your hand is as heavy as your temper is passionate. He remembers that blow!” VOL. I. 6 “It isn't that altogether;” replied the other—“but the truth is that we English are not favourites here, even among the most loyal of this people. There's a leaning to their own folks, that always gets them the preference when we oppose them; and old Muggs has never been slow to show us that he has no love to spare for any king's man across the water. I only wonder, knowing their dislikes as I do, that there's a single loyalist in the colony. These fellows that ride behind us, merciless as they have ever shown themselves in a conflict with the rebels, yet, there's not one of them, who, in a pitched battle between one of us and one of them, wouldn't be more apt to halloo for him than for us. Nothing, indeed, has secured them to the king's side but the foolish violence of the rebels, which wouldn't suffer the thing to work its own way; and began tarring and feathering and flogging at the beginning of the squabble. Had they left it to time, there wouldn't have been one old Muggs from Cape Fear to St. Catharine's. We shouldn't have had such a troop as that which follows us now, nor would I, this day, be hunting, as lieutenant of dragoons, after a leader, who—” “Whom we shall not find in a hurry, and whom we no longer need,” said the subordinate, concluding the sentence which the other had partly suppressed. “Policy! policy!” exclaimed the lieutenant. “That was Rawdon's pretext for refusing me the commission; —and conferring it upon Morton. He belonged to some great family on the Congaree, and must have it therefore—but, now, he can scarcely refuse it, if it be as we suspect. If Morton be laid by the heels, even as a prisoner, he is dead to us. The rebels will never suffer him to live if they have taken him: and of this there can be little question. What follows if the men agree?” “And they do agree, or what is pretty much the same thing, the command naturally falls into your hands without a word said. We'll see to that to-night at Muggs'.” “Do so:—but take the lead, Darcy, and find out this short cut. The storm thickens, and these drops grow bigger every moment. I'll hurry the men forward at a canter; and even that will barely enable us to save our distance.” “It matters little for the wetting, lieutenant, to those who gain.” “Gain! yes! that's something!—but—” The sentence was finished in low tones unheard by the subordinate, who rode forward at a brisk pace and was shortly out of sight. “True, the gain is something. Power is always precious. But the prize is freedom. If Morton is down, I lose that presence which I hated—which I feared. Let me not deceive myself—though I may blind these. Edward Morton was one in whose presence I shrunk to less than my full proportions. That single act—that act of shame and baseness—made me his slave. He, alone, knows the guilt and the meanness of that wretched moment of my life. God! what would I not give to have that memory obliterated in him who did, and him who beheld, the deed of that moment. I feel my heart tremble at his approach—my muscles wither beneath his glance; and I, who fear not the foe, and shrink not from the danger, and whom men call brave—brave to desperation—I dare not lift my eyes to the encounter with those of another having limbs and a person neither stronger nor nobler than my own. He down, and his lips for ever closed, and I am free. I can then breathe in confidence, and look around me without dreading the glances of another eye.—But, even should he live— should he have escaped this danger—why should I continue to draw my breath in fear, when a single stroke may make my safety certain—may rid me of every doubt —every apprehension? It must be so. Edward Morton, it is sworn. In your life my shame lives, and while your lips have power of speech, I am no moment safe from dishonour. Your doom is written, surely and soon, if it be not already executed.” These words were only so many indistinct mutterings, inaudible to those who followed him. He commanded them to approach, quickened their speed, and the whole troop, following his example, set off on a smart canter in the track which Darcy had taken. Meanwhile, the storm which before had only threatened, began to pour down its torrents, and ere they reached the promised shelter at Muggs'—a rude cabin of pine logs to which all direct approach was impossible, and which none but an initiate could have found, so closely was it buried among the dense groves that skirted the river swamp, and may have formed a portion of its primitive domain. Here the party came to a full halt, but the object at which they aimed appeared to be less their own than their horses and equipments. These were conducted into yet deeper recesses, where, in close woods and shrubbery, in which art had slightly assisted nature, they were so bestowed, as to suffer only slightly from the storm. The greater portion of the troop took shelter in the cabin of Muggs, while a small squad still kept in motion around the neighbourhood, heedless of the weather, and quite as watchful from long habit, as if totally unconscious of any annoyances. The establishment of Muggs was one, in fact, belonging to the party. Muggs, himself, was a retired trooper, whom a wound in the right arm had so disabled that amputation became necessary. Useless to the troop in actual conflict, he was yet not without his uses in the position which he held, and the new duties he had undertaken. He was a blunt, fearless old soldier, a native of the neighbourhood, who, being maimed, was tolerated by the whigs as no longer capable of harm; and suffered to remain in a region in which it was thought, even if disposed to do mischief, his opportunities were too few to make his doings of very serious importance. He sold good liquor also, and as he made no distinction between his customers, and provided whigs and tories at the same prices, there was no good reason to expel him from his present position by way of punishing him for a course of conduct to which so heavy a penalty seemed already to have been attached. He was prudent enough, though he did not withhold his opinions, to express them without warmth or venom; and, as it was well known to the patriots that he had never been a savage or blood-thirsty enemy, there was a very general disposition among them to grant him every indulgence. Perhaps, however, all these reasons would have been unavailing in his behalf, at the sanguinary period of which we write, but for the excellence of his liquors, and the certainty of his supply. His relation with the British enabled him always to provide himself at Charleston, and every public convoy replenished his private stores. It should be also understood that none of the whigs, at any moment, suspected the worthy landlord of a previous or present connexion with a band so notoriously odious as that of the Black Riders. The appearance of these desperadoes was only a signal to Muggs to take additional precautions. As we have already stated, a portion of the band were sent out to patrol the surrounding country, and their number, on the present occasion, was, by the earnest entreaty of the host, made twice as large as their captain thought there was any occasion for. But the former insisted with characteristic stubbornness, and with a degree of sullenness in his manner which was foreign to his usual custom. “I'm not over pleased to see you here at all, this time, lieutenant, though I reckon you've a good reason enough for coming. There's a bright stir among the rebels all along the Wateree, and down on the Santee, there's no telling you how far. As for the Congaree, it's a swarm, in spite of all Bill Cunningham can do, and he's twice as spry as ever. Here, only two days ago, has been that creeping critter, Supple Jack; that come in, as I may say, over my shoulder, like the old Satan himself. At first I did think it was the old Satan, till he laughed at my scare, and I then know'd him by his laugh. Now it's not so easy to cheat Supple Jack, and he knows all about your last coming. He's willing to befriend me, though he give me fair warning, last time he was here, that I was suspicioned for loving you too well. Now, split my cedars, men, I've got mighty little reason to love you—you know that—and I'm thinking, for your sake and mine both, the sooner you draw spur for the mountains, the smoother will be the skin you keep. I don't want to see the ugly face of one of you for a month of Sundays.” “Why, Muggs—old Muggs—getting scared in the 6* very beginning of the season? How's this—what's come over you?” was the demand of half a dozen. “I've reason to be scared, when I know that hemp's growing for every man that keeps bad company. Such rapscallions as you, if you come too often, would break up the best `mug' in the country.” The landlord's pun was innocent enough, and seemed an old one. It awakened no more smile on his lips than upon those of his guests. It was spoken in serious earnest. He continued to belabour them with half playful abuse, mingled with not a few well-intended reproaches, while providing, with true landlord consideration, for their several demands. The Jamaica rum was put in frequent requisition—a choice supply of lemons was produced from a box beneath the floor, and the band was soon broken up into little groups that huddled about, each after its own fashion, in the several corners of the wigwam. The rain meanwhile beat upon, and, in some places, through the roof—the rush of the wind, the weight of the torrent, and the general darkness of the scene, led naturally to a considerable relaxation even of that small degree of discipline which usually existed among the troop. Deep draughts were swallowed, loud talking ensued, frequent oaths, and occasionally a sharp dispute, qualified by an equally sharp snatch of song from an opposite quarter, proved all parties to be at ease, and each busy to his own satisfaction. The lieutenant of the troop, whom we have just seen acting in command, was perhaps the least satisfied of any of the party. Not that he had less in possession, but that he had more in hope. He suffered the jibe and the song to pass; the oath roused him not, nor did he seem to hear the thousand and one petty disputes that gave excitement to the scene. He seemed disposed— and this may have been a part of his policy—to release his men from all the restraints, few though they were, which belonged to his command. But his policy was incomplete. It was not enough that he should confer licentious privileges upon his followers—to secure their sympathies, he should have made himself one of them. He should have given himself a portion of that license which he had accorded to them. But the was too much of the Englishman for that. He could not divest himself of that haughty bearing which was so habitual in the carriage of the Englishman in all his dealings with the provincial, and which, we suspect, was, though unde clared, one of the most active influences to provoke the high-spirited people of the south to that violent severing of their connexion with the mother country, which was scarcely so necessary in their case as in that of the northern colonies. The lieutenant, whose name was Stockton, made sundry, but not very successful efforts, to blend himself with his comrades. He shared their draughts, he sometimes yielded his ears where the dialogue seemed earnest—sometimes he spoke, and his words were sufficiently indulgent; but he lacked utterly that ease of carriage, that simplicity of manner, which alone could prove that his condescension was not the result of effort, and against the desires of his mind. His agent, Darcy, was more supple as he was more subile. He was not deficient in those arts which, among the ignorant, will aways secure the low. He drank with them, as if he could not well have drunk without them—threw himself among their ranks, as if he could not have disposed his limbs easily any where else; and did for his superior, what the latter could never have done for himself. He operated sufficinetly on the minds of several to secure a faction in his favour, and thus strengthened, he availed himself of the moment when the Jamaica had proved some portion of its potency, to broach openly the subject which had hitherto been only discussed in private. Of the entreaties, the arguments, or the promises made by Ensign Darcy to persuade the troop into his way of thinking, we shall nothing. It will be sufficient for our purpose that we show the condition of things at this particular juncture. Considerable progress had now been made with the subject. It had, in fact, become the one subject of discussion. The person whom it more immediately concerned, had, prudentlyu, if not modestly, withdrawn himself from the apartment, though in doing so, he necessarily exposed himself to some encounter with the pitiless storn. The various groups had mingled themselves into one. The different smaller topies which before excited them, had given way before the magnitude of this, and each trooper began to feel his increased importances as his voice seemed necessary in the creation of so great a person as his captain. So far, Darcy had no reason to be dissatisfied with his performances. Assisted by the Jamaica, his arguments had sunk deep into their souls. One after another had become a convert to his view, and he was just about to flatter himself with the conviction that he should soon be rejoiced by the unanimous shout which should declare the nominaion of their new captain, when another party, who before had said not a single word, now joined in the discussion after a manner of his own. This was no less important a personage than Muggs, the landlord. “Counting scupls before you take 'em! I wonder where the dickens you was brought up, Ensign Darcy. Here now you're for making a new cappin, afore you know what's come of the old. You reckon Ned Mbrton's dead, do you? I reckon he's alive and kicking. I don't say so, mind me. I wouldn't wear sich a thing on Scripture book, but I'm so night sure of it, that I'd be willinhg to swear never agen to touch a drop of the stuff if so be he is not alive.” “But, Muggs—if he's alive where is he?” “Gog's wounds! that's easier asked than answered: but if we go to count for dead every chap that's missing, I'd have to go in mourning mighty often for the whole troop of you, my chickens. It's more reasonable that he's alive jist because we don't hear of him. We'd ha' hearn of him soon enough if the rebels had a got him. We'd ha' seen his hide upon a drum-head, and his own head upon a stump, and there wouldn't ha' been a dark corner on the Wateree that wouldn't ha' been ringing with the uproar about it. I tell you, my lads, that day that sees the death of New Morton, won't be a quiet day in these parts. There'll be more of a storm in these woods than is galloping through 'em now. If you don't cry that day, the rebets will; and let them lose what they may in the skrimmage, they'll have a gain when they flatten him on his back!” “Ah, Muggs!” exclaimed Darcy, “I'm afraid you let your wishes blind you to the truth. I suppose you don't know that we got the captain's horse, and he all bloody?” “Don't I know, and don't I think, for that very reason too, that he's safe and sound, and will soon be among you. You found his horse, but not him. The horse was bloody. Well! If the blood had been his and vital blood, don't you think you'd ha' found the rider as well as the horse? But, perhaps, you didn't stay long enough for the hunt. Folks say you all rode well enough that day. But if the cappin was mortal hurt and you didn't find him, the rebels would, and then what a `halloo-balloo' we should have had. No, to my thinking, the cappin lost the horse a-purpose when he found he couldn't lose the rebels. The whole troop of Butler was upon him, swearing death again him at every jump. Be sure now, Ned Morton left the critter to answer for him, and tuk to the swamp like a brown bear in September. I can't feel as if he was dead; and, if he was, Ensign Darcy, I, for one, wouldn't help in making a cappin out of any butr one that comes out of the airth. I'm for country born, if any.” “Well, Muggs, what objection do you find to the lieutenant?” “He's not country born, I tell you.” “But he's a good officer—there's not a better in the country than Lieutenant Stockton.” “That mout be, and then, agin, it moutn't. I'm a-thinking Ben Williams is about as good a man as you could choose for your cappin, if so be Ned Morton's slipped hiss wind for sartin. I don't see Ben here to-night—at this present—but look at him when he comes in, and you'll say that's the man to be a cappin. He's a dragoon, now, amog a thousand, and then, agin, he's country born.” “But Muggs, I don't see that your argument goes for much. An American born is a king's man, and a British born is the same, and its natural, when they're fighting on the same side, that a Brish born should have command just the same as the American.” “I don't see that it's natural, and I don't believe it. There's a mightly difference between 'em to my thinking. As for your king's men and British men. I'm one that wishes you had let us alone to fight it out among ourselves, rebel and loyal, jist as we stand. It was a sort of family quarred, and would he' been soon over, if you hadn't dipped a long spoon into our dish. They'd ha' licked us or we'd ha' licked them, and which ever way it went, we'd all ha' been quiet long afore this. But here you come, with your Irishmen, and your Yagers, your Scotchmen and your Jarmans, and you've made the matter worse without helping yourselves. For, where are you? As you what? No, by the powers! You say Rawdon's licked Greene. It's well enough to say so. But where's Greene and where's Rawdon? IF you aint hearn, I can tell you.” “Well?” from half a dozen. “Let's heat! The news! The news!” “Well! It's not well—not well for you, at least; and the sooner you're gone from these parts the better. Rawdon that licked Greene is about to run from Greene that he licked. I have it from Scrub Heriot—little Scrub, you know—that they've had secret council in Camden, and all's in a mist there—the people half scared to death, for they say that they can't get becon or beans, and Rawdon's going to vackyate, and swearns, if he had to do so, he'll make Camden such a blaze that it'll light his way all down to Charlestown. I'm looking out for the burst every night. That's not all. There's as fresh a gathering of the rebels along the Santee and Pedee under Marion, as if every fellow you had ever killed had got his sculp back again, and was jest as ready to kick as ever. Well, Tom Taylor's brushing like a little breeze about Granby, and who but Sumter rides the road now from Ninety-Six to Augusta? Who but he? Cunningham darsn't show his teeth along the track for fear they'll be drawed through the back of his head. Well, if this is enough to make you feel scarey, aint it enough to make Ned Morton keep close and hold in his breath till he finds a clean country before him. Don't you think of making a new cappin till you're sartin what's come of the old; and if it's all over with him, then I say look out for another man among you that comes out of the airth. Ben Williams for me, lads, before any other.” “Hurrah for Ben Williams!” was the maudlin ery of half a dozen. The lieutenant at this moment reappeared. His glance was frowningly fixed upon the landlord, in a way to convince Muggs that he had not remained uninformed as to the particular course which the latter had taken. But it was clearly not his policy to show his anger in any more decided manner, and the cudgels were taken up for him by Darcy, who, during the various long speeches of the landlord had contrived to maintain a running fire among the men. He plied punch and persuasion—strong argument and strong drink—with equal indusry; and the generous tendencies of the party began every where to overflow. He felt his increasing strength, and proceecded to carry the attack into the enemy's country. “The truthy is, Muggs, you have a grude at the lieutenant ever since you had that brush together. You can't so readily forget that ugly mark on your muzzle.” “Look you, Ensign Darcy, there's something in that you say that a leetle turns upon my stomach; for you see it's not the truth. I have no more grudge again Lieutenant Stockton than I have again you. As for the mark you speak of, I do say, it did him nho great credit to make such a mark on a one-armed man; though I'd ha' paid him off with a side-wipe that would he' made him 'spectful enough to the one I had left, if so be that Ben Williams hadn't put in to save him. That was the only onfriendly thing that Ben ever done to me to my knowing. No! I han't no grudges, thank God for all his blessings, but that's no reason why I shouldn't say what I do say, that Cappin Ned Morton'ss the man for my money; and, thouhg I can't have much to say in the business, seeing I aint no longer of the troop, yet if'twas the last word I had to reticulate, I'd cry it for him. Here's to Ned Morton, boys, living or dead.” “And here's to Lieutenant Stockton, boys, and may he soon be Captain of the Black Riders.” “Hurrah for Stockton! Hurrah!” was the now almost unanimous cry, and Stockton, advancing, was about the speak, when the faint sounds of a whistle broke upon the night, imparting a drearier accent to the melancholy soughing of the wind without. The note, again repeated, brought every trooper to his feet. The cups were set down hastily—swords buckled on—caps donned, and pistols examinds. “To horse,” was the command of Stockton, and his cool promptitude, shown on this occation, was perhaps quite enough to justify the choice which the troop had been about to make of a new captain. “To hourse,” he cried, leading the way to the entrance, but ere he reached it, the door was thrown wide, and the ambitious lieutenant recoiled in consternation, as he encountered in the face of the new comer the stern visage of that very man, supposed to be dead, whom he equally feared and hated, and whose post he was so well disposed to fill. The chief of the Black Riders stood suddenly among his followers, and the shouts for the new commandard were almost forgotten in those which welcomed the old. But let us retrace our steps for a few moments, and bring our readers once more within hearing of the kinsmen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. FIRST FRUITS OF FREEDOM. It is not important to our narrative, in returning to the place and period when and where we left the rival kinsmen, that we should repeat the arguments which the younger employed in order to persuade the other to a more open and manly course of conduct in his political career. These arguments could be of one character only. The style in which they were urged, however, became somewhat different, after the final interview which they had in the presence of the sturdy woodman. The display which Supple Jack had made of the disguises which he had found upon the very road over which Edward Conway had fled, and about the very time when he had taken shelter in the swamp from the pursuit of Butler's men, would, to any mind not absolutely anxious not to believe, have been conclusive of his guilt. Edward Conway felt it to be so in his own case, and readily concluded that Clarence would esteem it so. The few reflections, therefore, which time permitted him to make, were neither pleasant nor satisfactory; and when he galloped off with his younger brother, he had half a doubt whether the latter did not meditate his sudden execution, as soon as they should be fairly concealed from the sight of the woodman. He knew enough of the character of Clarence to know that he would as soon destroy his own brother for treachery— nay, sooner—than an open enemy; and the silence which he maintained, the stern, rigid expression of his features, and the reckless speed at which he seemed resolved to ride, contributed in no small degree to increase his apprehensions. VOL. I. 7 For a brief space that ready wit and prompt subterfuge, which had enabled him hitherto to play a various and very complicated game in life, with singular adroitness and success, seemed about to fail. He felt his elasticity lessening fast—his confidence in himself declining; his brain was heavy, his tongue flattened and thick. He was weaponless. There was no chance of success in any conflict, unless from his enemy's generosity; and upon that, in those days, the partisan who fought on either side made but few calculations. A club, the rudest mace, the roughest limb of the lithe hickory, became an object of desire to the mind of the conscious traitor at this moment. But he did not truly understand the nature of that mind and those principles, to which his own bore so little likeness. He little knew how strong and active were those doubts—the children of his wish—which were working in the bosom of Clarence Conway in his behalf. At length the latter drew up his steed, and exhibited a wish to stop. The rain, which by this time had become an incessant stream, had hitherto been almost unfelt by either. The anxiety and sorrow of the one, and the apprehensions of the other, had rendered them equally insensible to the storm without. “Edward Conway,” said the younger, “let us alight here. Here we must separate; and here I would speak to you, perhaps for the last time, as my father's son.” Somewhat reassured, Edward Conway followed the example of his kinsman, and the two alighted among a group of hills, on the eastern side of which they found a partial protection from the storm, which was blowing from the west. But little did either need at that moment of shelter from its violence. Brief preparation sufficed to fasten their steeds beneath a close clump of foliage, and then followed the parting words of the younger, which had been so solemnly prefaced. “Now, Edward Conway, my pledges to you are all fulfilled—my duties, too. I have done even more than was required at my hands by any of the ties of blood. I have been to you a brother, and you are now free.” “You do not repent of it, Clarence?” “Of that, it is fitting that I say nothing rashly. Time will show. But I need not say to you, Edward Conway, that the discovery of these disguises, under circumstances such as Jack Bannister detailed before you, has revived, in all their force my old suspicions. God knows how much I have striven to set my soul against these suspicions. God only knows how much I would give could I be sure that they were groundless. I dare not for my father's sake believe them—I dare not for my own. And this dread to believe, Edward Conway, is, I fear, the only thing that has saved, and still saves you, from my blow. But for this, kinsman or no kinsman, your blood had been as freely shed by these hands, as if its sluices were drawn from the least known and basest puddle in existence.” “I am at your mercy, Clarence Conway. I have no weapons. My arms are folded. I have already spoken when I should have been silent. I will say no more— nothing, certainly, to prevent your blow. Strike, if you will: if I cannot convince you that I am true, I can at least show you that I am fearless.” The wily kinsman knew well the easy mode to disarm his brother—to puzzle his judgment, if not to subdue his suspicions. “I have no such purpose!” exclaimed Clarence, chokingly. “Would to heaven you would give me no occasion to advert to the possibility that I ever should have. But hear me, Edward Conway, ere we part. Do not deceive yourself—do not fancy that I am deceived by this show of boldness. It did not need that you should assure me of your fearlessness. That I well knew. It is not your courage, but your candour, of which I am doubtful. The display of the one quality does not persuade me any the more of your possession of the other. We are now to part. You are free from this moment. You are also safe. Our men are no longer on the Wateree;—a few hours' good riding will bring you, most probably, within challenge of Watson's sentinels. If you are the foe to your country, which they declare you, he is your friend. That you do not seek safety in our ranks, I need no proof. But, ere we part, let me repeat my warnings. Believe me, Edward Conway, dear to me as my father's son, spare me, if you have it in your heart, the pain of being your foe. Spare me the necessity of strife with you. If it be that you are a loyalist, let us not meet. I implore it as the last favour which I shall ever ask at your hands; and I implore it with a full heart. You know that we have not always been friends. You know that there are circumstances, not involving our principles, on which we have already quarrelled, and which are of a nature but too well calculated to bring into activity the wildest anger and the deadliest hate. But, however much we have been at strife—however I may have fancied that you have done me wrong—still, believe me, when I tell you that I have ever, in my cooler moments, striven to think of, and to serve, you kindly. Henceforward our meeting must be on other terms. The cloud which hangs about your course—the suspicion which stains your character in the minds of others—have at last affected mine. We meet, hereafter, only as friends or foes. Your course must then be decided—your principles declared—your purpose known; and then, Edward Conway, if it be, as men declare, and as I dare not yet believe, that you are that traitor to your country—that you do lead that savage banditti which has left the print of their horses' hoofs, wherever they have trodden, in blood—then must our meeting be one of blood only; and then, as surely as I shall feel all the shame of such a connexion in my soul, shall I seek, by a strife without remorse, to atone equally to my father and to my country for the crime and folly of his son. Fondly do I implore you, Edward Conway, to spare me this trial. Let our parting at this moment be final, unless we are to meet on terms more satisfactory to both.” The elder of the kinsmen, at this appeal, displayed more emotion, real or affected, than he had shown at any time during the interview. He strode to and fro among the tall trees, with hands clasped behind, eyes cast down upon the earth, and brows contracted. A single quiver might have been seen at moments among the muscles of his mouth. Neither of them seemed to heed the increasing weight of the tempest. Its roar was unheard—its torrents fell without notice around and upon them. The reply of Edward Conway was at length spoken. He approached his brother. He had subdued his emotions, whatever might have been their source. His words were few—his utterance composed and calm. He extended his hand to Clarence as he spoke. “Let us part, Clarence. It does not become me to make farther assurances. To reply, as I should, to what you have said, might be, probably, to increase the width and depth of that chasm which seems to lie between us. I cannot say that I am satisfied with your tone, your temper, the position which you assume, and the right which you claim to direct, and warn, and counsel;—and when you threaten!—But enough! Let us part before any thing be said which shall make you forget any thing which you should remember, or me that I owe my life to your assistance. What is said is said—let it be forgotten. Let us part.” “Ay, let us part: but let it not be forgotten, Edward Conway?” “True, true! Let it not be forgotten. It shall not be forgotten. It cannot be. It would not be easy for me, Clarence, to forget any thing which has taken place in the last ten days of my life.” There was a latent signification in what was said by the speaker to arouse new suspicions in the mind of the younger of the kinsmen. He saw, or fancied that he saw, a gleam of ferocity shine out from the eyes of his brother, and his own inflammable temper was about to flare up anew. “Do you threaten, Edward Conway? Am I to understand you as speaking the language of defiance?” “Understand me, Clarence, as speaking nothing which should not become a man and your brother.” The reply was equivocal. That it was so, was reason sufficient why Clarence Conway should hesitate to urge a matter which might only terminate in bringing their quarrel to a crisis. “The sooner we separate the better,” was his only answer. “Here, Edward Conway, is one of my pistols. You shall not say I sent you forth without weapons to defend you, into a forest filled, possibly, with foes. The 7* horse which you ride is a favourite. You have lost your's. Keep him till you are provided. You can always find an opportunity to return him when you are prepared to do so; and should you not, it will make no difference. Farewell: God be with you,—but remember!—remember!” The youth grasped the now reluctant hand of the elder Conway; wrung it with a soldier's grasp—a pressure in which mingled feelings, all warm, all conflicting, had equal utterance;—then, springing upon his steed, he dashed rapidly into the forest, and in a few moments was hidden from sight in its thickest mazes. “Remember! Yes, Clarence Conway, I will remember. Can I ever forget! Can I ever forget the arrogance which presumes to counsel, to warn, and to threaten—to pry into my privacy—to examine my deeds—to denounce them with shame and threaten them with vengeance. I will remember—to requite! It shall not be always thus. The game will be in my hands ere many days, and I will play it as no gamester, with all upon the cast, ever yet played the game of life before. Without pause or pity—resolved and reckless—I will speed on to the prosecution of my purposes, until my triumph is complete! I must beware, must I?—I must account for my incomings and outgoings? And why, forsooth? Because I am your father's son. For the same reason do you beware! I were no son of my father if I did not resent this insolence.” He had extricated his horse from the cover which concealed him while he was giving utterance to this soliloquy. The noble animal neighed and whinnied after his late companion. The plaintive appeal of the beast seemed to irritate his rider, whose passions, subjected to a restraint which he had found no less necessary than painful, were now seeking that vent which they had been denied for an unusual season; and under their influence he struck the animal over the nostril with the heavy hand of that hate which he fain would have bestowed upon his master. “Remember!” he muttered, as he leaped upon the saddle. “I need no entreaty to this end, Clarence Conway. I must be a patriot at your bidding, and choose my side at your suggestion; and forbear the woman of my heart in obedience to the same royal authority. We shall see!—We shall see!” And, as he spoke, the sheeted tempest driving in his face the while—he shook his threatening hand in the direction which his brother had taken. Turning his horse's head upon an opposite course, he then proceeded, though at a less rapid rate, to find that shelter, which he now, for the first time, began to consider necessary. It may have been ten minutes after their separation, when he heard a sound at a little distance which aroused his flagging attention. “That whistle,” said he to himself, “is very like our own. It may be! They should be here, if my safety were of any importance; and if that reptile Stockton would suffer them; that fellow is a spy upon me, sworn doubly to my destruction if he can find the means. But let me find him tripping, and a shot gives him prompt dismissal. Again!—it is!—they are here—the scouts are around me, and doubtlessly the whole troop is at Muggs' this moment. There, he could do me no harm. Muggs is sworn my friend against all enemies, and he is true as any enemy.—Again, the signal! They shall have an echo.” Speaking thus he replied in a sound similar to that which he heard, and an immediate response, almost at his elbow, satisfied him of the truth of his first impression. He drew up his steed, repeated the whistle, and was now answered by the swift tread of approaching horses. In a few moments, one, and then another—appeared in sight, and the captain of the Black Riders of Congaree once more found himself surrounded by his men. Their clamours, as soon as he was recognized, attested his popularity among his troop. “Ha, Irby!—Ha, Burnet! Is it you;—and you, Gibbs—you, Fisher: I rejoice to see you. Your hands, my good fellows. There! There! You are well—all well.” The confused questions and congratulations, all together, of the troopers, while they gave every pleasure to their chieftain, as convincing him of their fidelity, rendered unnecessary any attempt at answer or explanation. Nor did Edward Conway allow himself time for this. His words, though friendly enough, were few; and devoted, seemingly, to the simple business of the troop. Captain Morton—for such was the name by which only he was known to them—with the quickness of a governing instinct, derived, from a few brief comprehensive questions, all that he desired to know in regard to their interests and position. He ascertained where the main body would be found, and what had taken place during his absence; and proceeded instantly to the reassumption of his command over them. “Enough of this, my good fellows. I will see to all this at Muggs'. We have no time now for unnecessary matter. You have work on hand. Burnet, do you take with you Gibbs, Irby and Fisher. Push your horses down for the Wateree by the first road running left of where we now stand. Do you know the route? It leads by the clay diggings of the old Dutchman—the brick burner—what's his name?” “I know it, sir”.— “Enough, then. Take that road—put the steel into your nags, but send them forward. If you are diligent you will overtake one of our worst enemies:—a friend of Butler—a rebel—no less than Colonel Conway. Pursue and catch him. You cannot fail to overtake him if you try for it. Take him prisoner, alive, if you can;— I particularly wish that you should have him alive—but, remember, take him at every hazard. Living or dead, he must be ours.” The dragoon lingered for farther orders. “If you succeed in taking him, bring him on to Muggs'. Give the signal before you reach his cabin, that there may be no surprise—no mistake. Something depends on your observance of this caution—so, you will remember. Away, now; and ride for life.” Their obedience was sufficiently prompt. In an instant they were on their way, pursuing the track which Clarence had taken for the Wateree. “Now!” exclaimed the outlaw-chief with exultation— “now, there is some chance for vengeance. If they succeed in taking him alive, I will practise upon him to his utter blindness—I will do him no harm unless a close lodging house will do him harm. If they kill him—well, it is only one of those chances of war which he voluntarily incurs: it is only the lower cast of the die. Yet, I trust, it may not be so. I am not yet prepared for that. He is my father's son.—He has stood beside me in danger. He deserves that I should spare him. But, even for all this he may not be spared, if he is to triumph over —to sway me with his arrogance—to achieve all victories in love as in war. In love!—God, what a strange nature is this of mine. How feeble am I when I think of her. And of her I cannot help but think—her beauty, her pride of soul—ay, even her arrogance I can think of with temper and with love.—But his—no! no! He has spoken too keenly to my soul; and when he forbids that I should seek and see her, he forfeits every claim. Let them slay him, if they please—it can only come to this at last.” And, with these words, striking with his open palm upon the neck of his horse, he drove him forward to Muggs'. His entrance we have already seen and the wonder it excited.—The wonder in all—the consternation in one. The troopers, with one voice, cried out for their ancient captain, and Stockton, confounded and defeated, could only hoarsely mingle his congratulations with the rest, in accents more faltering, and with—as the outlaw captain well apprehended—with far less sineerity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. FINESSE.—CAPTIVITY. Edward Morton bestowed upon his second officer but a single glance, beneath which his eye fell and his sould became troubled. That glance was one of equal scorn and suspicion. It led the treacherous subordinate, with the natural tendency of a guilty conscience, to apprehend that all his machinations had been discovered; that some creature of his trust had proved treacherous, and that he stood in the presence of one who had come with the full purpose of vengeance and of punishment. But, though secure as yet in this respect, Lieutenant Stockton was not equally so in others, scarcely of less consequence. He had neglected, even if he had not betrayed, his trust. He had kept aloof from the place of danger, when his aid was required, and left his captain to all those risks—one of which has been already intimated to the reader—which naturally followed a duty of great and peculiar exposure, to which the latter had devoted himself. Even when this risk had been taken, and the dangers incurred, he had either forborne that search after his superior, or had so pursued it, as to render his efforts almost ineffectual. He had undertaken the toils of villany without reaping any of its pleasant fruits. The return of his superior, as it were, from the grave, left him utterly discomfited. His rewards were as far off as ever from his hopes; and, to his fears, his punishments were at hand. His apprehensions were not wholly without foundation. So soon as the chief of the Black Riders could relieve himself from the oppressive congratulations which encountered his safe restoration to his troop, he turned upon the lieutenant, and with an indignation more just than prudent declared his disapprobation of his conduct. “I know not, Lieutenant Stockton, how you propose to satisfy Lord Rawdon for your failure to bring your men to Dukes' as I ordered you; but I shall certainly report to him your neglect in such language as shall speak my own opinion of it, however it may influence his. The consequences of your misconduct are scarcely to be computed. You involved me individually in an unnecessary risk of life; and lost a happy opportunity of striking one of the best blows in the cause of his majesty which has been stricken this campaign. The whole troop of the rebel Butler was in our hands—they must have been annihilated but for your neglect—a neglect too, which is wholly unaccountable, as I myself had prescribed every step in your progress, and waited for your coming with every confidence in the result.” “I did not know, sir, that there was any prospect of doing any thing below here, and I heard of a convoy on the road to General Greene.—” “Even that will not answer, Lieutenant Stockton. You were under orders for one duty, and presumed too greatly on your own judgment when you took the liberty of making a different disposition of the troop left to your guidance. You little dream, sir, how nigh you were to ruin. But a single hour saved you from falling in with all Sumter's command, and putting an end for ever to your short-lived authority. And yet, sir, you are ambitious of sole command. You have your emissaries among the troop urging your fitness to lead them; as if such proofs were ever necessary to those who truly deserve them. Your emissaries, sir, little know our men. It is enough for them to know that you left your leader in the hands of his enemies, at a time when all his risks were incurred for their safety and your own.” “I have no emissaries, sir, for any such purpose;” replied the subordinate sulkily; his temper evidently rising from the unpleasant exposure which was making before those who had only recently been so well tutored in his superior capacities. “You do me injustice, sir— you have a prejudice against me. For—” “Prejudice, and against you, sir!” was the scornful interruption of the chief. “No more, sir; I will not hear you farther. You shall have the privilege of being heard by those against whom you can urge no such imputations. Your defence shall be made before a court martial. Yield up your sword, sir, to Mr. Barton.” The eye of the lieutenant, at this mortifying moment, caught that of the maimed veteran Muggs; and the exulting satisfaction which was expressed by the latter was too much for his firmness. He drew the sword, but instead of tendering the hilt to the junior officer who had been commanded to receive it, confronted him with the point, exclaiming desperately— “My life first! I will not be disgraced before the men!” “Your life, then!” was the fierce exclamation of Morton, spoken with instant promptness, as he hurled the pistol with which Clarence Conway had provided him, full in the face of the insubordinate. At that same moment, the scarcely less rapid movement of Muggs, enabled him to grasp the offender about the body with his single arm. The blow of the pistol took effect, and the lieutenant would have been as completely prostrated, as he was stunned by it, had it not been for the supporting grasp of the landlord, which kept him from instantly falling. The blood streamed from his mouth and nostrils—half conscious only he strove to advance, and his sword was partially lifted as if to maintain with violence the desperate position which he had taken, but, by this time, a dozen ready hands were about him. The weapon was wrested from his hold, and the wounded man thrust down upon the floor of the hovel, where he was held by the heavy knee of more than one of the dragoons, while others were found equally prompt to bind his arms. They were all willing to second the proceedings, however fearful, of a chief whose determination of character they well knew, and against whom they also felt they had themselves somewhat offended, in the ready acquiescence which most of them had given to the persuasive arguments and entreaties of Darcy. This latter person had now no reverence to display for the man in whose cause he had been only too officious. He was one of those moral vanes which obey the wind of circumstances, and acquire that flexibility of habit, which, after a little while, leaves it impossible to make them fixed. He did not, it is true, join in the clamour against his late ally; but he kept sufficiently aloof from any display of sympathy. His own selfish fears counselled him to forbearance, and he was not ambitious of the crown of martyrdom in the cause of any principle so purely abstract as that of friendship. To him, the chief of the Black Riders gave but a single look, which sufficiently informed him that his character was known and his conduct more than suspected. The look of his superior had yet another meaning, and that was one of unmitigated contempt. Unlike the lieutenant, Darcy was sufficiently prudent, however, not to display by glance, word, or action, the anger which he felt. He wisely subdued the resentment in his heart, preferring to leave to time the work of retribution. But he did not, any more than Stockton, forego his desire for ultimate revenge. He was one of those who could wait, and whose patience, like that of the long unsatisfied creditor, served only to increase, by the usual interest process, the gross amount of satisfaction which must finally ensue. It was not now for the first time that he was compelled to experience the scorn of their mutual superior. It may be stated, in this place, that the alliance between Stockton and himself was quite as much the result of their equal sense of injury at the hands of Morton, as because of any real sympathy between the parties. “Take this man hence,” was the command of Morton, turning once more his eyes upon the prostrate Stockton. “Take him hence, Sergeant Fisher—see him well bestowed—have his wants attended to, but see, above all things, that he escape not. He has gone too far in his folly to be trusted much longer with himself, till we are done with him entirely. This, I trust, will soon be the case.” This order gave such a degree of satisfaction to the VOL. I. 8 landlord, Muggs, that he found it impossible to conceal his delight. A roar of pleasure burst from his lips. “Ho! ho! ho!—I thought so.—I knew it must come to this. I thought it a blasted bad sign from the beginning, when he was so willing to believe the cappin was turned into small meat, and the choppings not to be come at. There's more of them sort of hawks in these parts, cappin, if 'twas worth any white man's while to look after them.” The last sentence was spoken with particular reference to Ensign Darcy, and the eyes of the stout landlord were fixed upon that person with an expression of equal triumph and threatening, but neither Darcy nor Morton thought it advisable to perceive the occult signification of his glance. The occupations of the latter, meanwhile, did not cease with the act of summary authority which we have witnessed. He called up to him an individual from his troop whose form and features somewhat resembled his own—whose general intelligence might easily be conjectured from his features, and whose promptness seemed to justify the special notice of his captain. This person he addressed as Ben Williams— a person whom the landlord, Muggs, had designated, in a previous chapter, as the most fitting to succeed their missing leader in the event of his loss. That Morton himself entertained some such opinion, the course of events will show. “Williams,” he said, after the removal of Stockton had been effected—“there is a game to play in which you must be chief actor. It is necessary that you should take my place, and seem for a while to be the leader of the Black Riders. The motive for this will be explained to you in time. Nay, more, it is necessary that I should seem your prisoner. You will probably soon have a prisoner in fact, in whose sight I would also occupy the same situation. Do with me then as one.— Hark!—That is even now the signal!—They will soon be here. Muggs, bar the entrance for a while, until every thing is ready. Now, Williams, be quick; pass your lines about my arms and bind me securely. Let one or more of your men watch me with pistols cocked, and show, all of you, the appearance of persons who have just made an important capture. I will tell you more hereafter.” The subordinate was too well accustomed to operations of the kind suggested, to offer any unnecessary scruple, or to need more precise directions. The outlaw was bound accordingly; placed, as he desired, upon a bulk that stood in a corner of the wigwam, while two black-faced troopers kept watch beside him. The signal was repeated from without; the parties, from the sound, being evidently close at hand. The chief of the outlaws whispered in the ear of his subordinate such farther instructions as were essential to his object. “Keep me in this situation, in connexion with the prisoner—should he be brought—for the space of an hour. Let us be left alone for that space of time. Let us then be separated, while you come to me in private. We shall then be better able to determine for the future.” The hurried preparations being completed, the chief, now seemingly a closely watched and strongly guarded prisoner, gave orders to throw open the entrance, and subdued his features to the expression of a well-grounded dissatisfaction with a situation equally unapprehended and painful. The capture of Clarence Conway was not such an easy matter. It will be remembered that when he separated from his brother, under the influence of feelings of a most exciting nature, he had given his horse a free spur, and dashed forward at full speed to regain his place of safety in the swamp. The rapidity of his start, had he continued at the same pace, would have secured him against pursuit. But, as his blood cooled, and his reflective mood assumed the ascendancy, his speed was necessarily lessened; and by the time that his treacherous kinsman was enabled to send the troopers in pursuit, his horse was suffered quietly to pick his way forward, in a gait most suited to his own sense of comfort. The consequence was inevitable. The pursuers gained rapidly upon him, and owing to the noise occasioned by the rain pattering heavily upon the leaves about him, he did not hear the sound of their horses' feet, until escape became difficult. At the same moment he discovered a horseman on either hand, while two others came close upon him in the rear. Their habits, the intentness of their pursuit, at once convinced him that they were enemies; and with just enough of the sense of danger to make him act decisively, the fearless partisan drew forth his pistol, cocked it without making any unnecessary display, and, at the same time, drove the rowel into the flanks of his steed. A keen eye sent forward upon the path which he was pursuing, enabled him to see that it was too closely covered with woods to allow him to continue much farther his present rate of flight, and, with characteristic boldness, he resolved to turn his course to the right, where the path was less covered with undergrowth, and on which his encounter would be with a single enemy only. The conflict with him he sanguinely trusted might be ended before the others could come up. The action, with such a temperament as that of Clarence Conway, was simultaneous with the thought; and a few moments brought him upon the one opponent, while his sudden change of direction, served, for a brief space, to throw the others out. The trooper, whom he thus singled out for the struggle, was a man of coolness and courage, but one scarcely so strong of limb, or so well exercised in conflict, as the partisan. He readily comprehended the purpose of the latter, and his own resolution was taken to avoid the fight, if he could, and yet maintain his relative position, during the pursuit, with the enemy he chased. To dash aside from the track, yet to push forward at the same time, was his design; at all events, to keep out of pistol shot himself, yet to be able, at any moment, to bring his opponent within it. Such a policy, by delaying the flight of the latter, until the whole party should come up, would render the capture inevitable. But he was not suffered to pursue this game at his own pleasure. The moment he swerved from the track, Conway dashed after him with increased earnestness, taking particular care to keep himself, meanwhile, between the individual and his friends. In this way he seemed to drive the other before him, and, as his own speed was necessarily increased under these circumstances, the man thus insulated became anxious about his position, and desirous to return. In a mutual struggle of this sort, the event depended upon the comparative ability of the two horses, and the adroitness, as horsemen, of the several riders. In both respects the advantage was with Conway; and he might have controlled every movement of his enemy, but for the proximity of those who were now pressing on behind him. The moment became one of increasing anxiety. They were approaching rapidly nigher, and the disparity of force in their favour was too considerable to leave him a single hope of a successful issue should he be forced to an actual encounter. The wits of the partisan were all put into activity. He soon saw that he must drive the individual before him entirely out of his path, or be forced to stand at bay against an attack in which defence was hopeless. His resolve was instantaneous; and, reasonably calculating against the probability of any pistol shot from either taking effect while under rapid flight, and through the misty rain then driving into their mutual faces, he resolved to run down his enemy by the sheer physical powers of his horse, in defiance of the latter's weapon and without seeking to use his own. He braced himself up for this exertion, and timed his movement fortunately, at a moment when, a dense thicket presenting itself immediately in the way of the man before him, rendered necessary a change in the direction of his flight. His reckless and sudden plunge forward discomposed the enemy, who found the partisan on his haunches at a time when to turn his steed became equally necessary and difficult. To wheel aside from the thicket was the instinctive movement of the horse himself, who naturally inclined to the more open path; but just under these circumstances, in his agitation, the trooper endeavoured to incline his bridle hand to the opposite side, in order that he might employ his weapon. The conflict between 8* his steed's instinct and his own, rendered his aim ineffectual. His pistol was emptied, but in vain; and the rush of Conway's horse immediately followed. The shock of conflict with the more powerful animal, precipitated the trooper, horse and man, to the earth, and the buoyant partisan went over him with the rapidity of a wind-current. A joyous shout attested his consciousness of safety—the outpourings of a spirit to which rapid action was always a delight, and strife itself nothing more than the exercise of faculties which seemed to have been expressly adapted for all its issues of agility and strength. Secure of safety, Conway dashed onwards, without an apprehension, and in a moment after had shared the fortune of him he had just overthrown. A sudden descent of one of the Wateree hills was immediately before him, and in the increasing dimness of the twilight, and under the rapidity of his flight, he did not observe that its declivity of yellow clay had been freshly washed into a gulley. His horse plunged forward upon the deceptive and miry surface, and lost his footing. A series of ineffectual plunges which he made to recover, brought him to the foot of the hill, where he lay half stunned and shivering. His girth had broken in the violent muscular efforts which he made to arrest his fall, and his rider, in spite of every exertion of skill and strength, was thrown forwards, and fell, though with little injury, upon the yellow clay below. He had barely time to recover his feet, but not his horse, when the pursuers were upon him. Resistance, under existing circumstances, would have been worse than useless; and with feelings of mortification, much better imagined than described, he yielded himself, with the best possible grace, to the hands of his captors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. ROUGH USAGE AMONG THE `RIDERS.' Nothing could exceed the surprise of Clarence Conway when, conducted by his captors into the house of Muggs, he beheld the condition of his kinsman. His ardent and unsuspicious nature at once reproached him with those doubts which he had entertained of the fidelity of the latter. He now wondered at himself for the ready credence which he had been disposed to yield, on grounds so slight and unsatisfactory as they then appeared to be, to the imputations against one so near to him by blood; and with the natural rapidity of the generous nature, he forgot, in his regrets for his own supposed errors, those of which his brother had, as he well knew, most certainly been guilty. He forgot that it was not less a reproach against Edward Conway—even if he was misrepresented as friendly to the cause of the invader— that he had forborne to show that he was friendly to that of his country; and, in that moment of generous forgetfulness, even the suspicious conduct of the fugitive in relation to his own affair of heart, passed from his memory. “Can it be!—Is it you, Edward Conway, that I find in this predicament?” were his first words when—the speaker being equally secured—they were left alone together. “You see me,” was the reply. “My ill reputation with the one side does not, it appears, commend me to any favour with the other.” “And these men?” said Clarence, inquiringly. “Are, it would seem, no other persons than your famous Black Riders. I have had a taste of their discipline already, and shall probably enjoy something more before they are done with me. It appears that they have discovered that I am as rabid a rebel as, by Butler's men, I was deemed a tory. They charge me with some small crimes—such as killing king's men and burning their houses, stabbing women and roasting children—to all of which charges I have pleaded not guilty, though with very little chance of being believed. I cannot complain, however, that they should be as incredulous in my behalf as my own father's son.” “Do not reproach me, Edward. Do me no injustice. You cannot deny that circumstances were against you, so strong as almost to justify belief in the mind of your father himself. If any man ever struggled against conviction, I was that man.” “Clarence Conway, you perhaps deceive yourself with that notion. But the truth is, your jealousy on the subject of Flora Middleton has made you only too ready to believe any thing against me. But I will not reproach you. Nay—I have resolved, believe what you may, hereafter to say nothing in my defence or justification. I have done something too much of this already for my own sense of self-respect. Time must do the rest—I will do no more.” The generous nature of Clarence deeply felt these expressions. His wily kinsman well understood that nature, and deliberately practised upon it. He listened to the explanations and assurances of the former with the doggedness of one who feels that he has an advantage, and shows himself resolute to keep it. Still he was too much of a proficient in the knowledge of human nature to over-act the character. He spoke but few words. He seldom looked at his brother while he spoke, and an occasional half-suppressed sigh betokened the pains of a spirit conscious of the keenest wrong, yet too proud even to receive the atonement which reminds him of it. An expression of sorrow and sadness, but not unkindness, prevailed over his features. His words, if they did not betoken despondency, yet conveyed a feeling almost of indifference to whatever might betide him. The language of his look seemed to say—“Suspected by my best friends, my father's son among them, it matters little what may now befall me. Let the enemy do his worst. I care not for these bonds,—I care for nothing that he can do.” Nothing, to the noble heart, is so afflicting as the consciousness of having done injustice; and to witness the suffering of another in consequence of our injustice, is one of the most excruciating of human miseries to a nature of this order. Such was the pang at this moment in the bosom of Clarence Conway. He renewed his efforts to soothe and to appease the resentments of his kinsman, with all the solicitude of truth. “Believe me, Edward, I could not well think otherwise than I have thought, or do other than I have done. You surely cannot deny that you placed yourself in a false position. It would have been wonderful, indeed, if your course had not incurred suspicion. “True friendship seldom suspects, and is the last to yield to the current when its course bears against the breast it loves. But let us say no more on this subject, Clarence. It has always been a painful one to me; and just now, passing, as I may say, from one sort of bondage to another, it is particularly so. It is, perhaps, unnecessary, situated as we are, that we should any longer refer to it. The doubts of the past may be as nothing to the dangers of the future. If this banditti be as you have described them, we shall have little time allowed us to discuss the past; and, for the future!—” He paused. “And yet, believe me, Edward, it makes me far happier to see you in these bonds, subjected to all the dangers which they imply, than to suffer from the accursed suspicion that you were the leader of this banditti.” “I thank you—indeed I thank you very much—for nothing! It may surprise you to hear me say that your situation yields me no pleasure. Your sources of happiness and congratulation strike me as being very peculiar.” “Edward Conway, why will you misunderstand me?” “Do I?” “Surely. What have I said to make you speak so bitterly?” “Nothing, perhaps;—but just now, Clarence, my thoughts and feelings are rather bitter than sweet, and may be supposed likely to impart something of their taste to what I say. But I begged that we might forbear the subject—all subjects—at this time; for the very reason that I feared something might be spoken by one or both which would make us think more unkindly of each other than before—which would increase the gulf between us.” “I think not unkindly of you, Edward. I regret what I have spoken unkindly, though under circumstances which, I still insist, might justify the worst suspicion in the mind of the best of friends. There is no gulf between us now, Edward Conway.” “Ay, but there is; an impassable one for both—a barrier which we have built up with mutual industry, and which must stand between us for ever. Know you Flora Middleton? Ha! Do you understand me now, Clarence Conway? I see you do—you are silent.” Clarence was, indeed, silent. Painful was the conviction that made him so. He felt the truth of what his brother had spoken. He felt that there was a gulf between them; and he felt also that the look and manner of his kinsman, while he spoke the name, together with the tone of voice in which it was spoken, had most unaccountably, and most immeasurably, enlarged that gulf. What could be the meaning of this? What was that mysterious antipathy of soul which could comprehend so instantly the instinct hate and bitterness in that of another. Clarence felt at this moment that, though his suspicions of Edward Conway, as the chief of the Black Riders, were all dissipated by the position in which he found him, yet he loved him still less than before. The tie of blood was weakened yet more than ever, and its secret currents were boiling up in either breast, with suppressed but increasing hostility. The pause was long and painful which ensued between them. At length Clarence broke the silence. His manner was subdued, but the soul within him was strengthened. The course of his kinsman had not continued to its close as judicious as it seemed at the beginning. It had been a wiser policy had he forborne even the intimation of reproach—had he assumed an aspect of greater kindness and love towards his companion in misfortune, and striven, by a studious display of cheerfulness, to prove to his brother that he was only apprehensive lest the situation in which the latter had found him might tend too much to his own self-reproach. Such would have been the course of a generous foe. Such should have been the course of one towards a generous friend. Forbearance, at such a moment, would have been the very best proof of the presence of a real kindness. But it was in this very particular that the mind of Edward Conway was weak. He was too selfish a man to know what magnanimity is! He did not sufficiently comprehend the nature of the man he addressed; and though the situation in which the latter found him had its effect, yet the policy which he subsequently pursued, most effectually defeated many of the moral advantages which must have resulted to him, in the mind of his brother, from a more liberal train of conduct. The reference to Flora Middleton placed Clarence on his guard. It reminded him that there were more grounds of difference between himself and kinsman than he had been just before prepared to remember. It reminded him that Edward Conway had been guilty of a mean evasion, very like a falsehood, in speaking of this lady; and this remembrance revived all his former personal distrusts, however hushed may have been all such as were purely political. Edward Conway discovered that he had made a false move in the game the moment that his brother resumed his speech. He was sagacious enough to perceive his error, though he vainly then might have striven to repair it. Clarence meanwhile proceeded as follows, with a grave severity of manner, which proved that, on one subject at least, he could neither be abused nor trifled with. “You have named Flora Middleton, Edward Conway. With me that name is sacred. I owe it to my own feelings, as well as to her worth, that it should not be spoken with irreverence. What purpose do you propose by naming her to me, at this moment, and with such a suggestion?” The outlaw assumed a bolder tone and a higher position than he took when the same subject was discussed between them in the swamp. There was an air of defiance in his manner as he replied, which aroused all the gall in his brother's bosom. “Am I to tell you now, for the first time, Clarence Conway, that I love Flora Middleton?” “Ha!—Is it so?—Well!” “It is even so! I love Flora Middleton—as I long have loved her.” “You are bold, Edward Conway! Am I to understand from this that you propose to urge your claims?” “One does not usually entertain such feelings without some hope to gratify them; and I claim to possess all the ordinary desires and expectations of humanity.” “Be it so, then, Edward Conway,” replied Clarence, with a strong effort at composure. “But,” he added, “if I mistake not, there was an understanding between us on this subject. You—” “Ay, ay, to pacify you—to avoid strife with my father's son, Clarence Conway, I made some foolish promise to subdue my own feelings out of respect to yours —some weak and unmanly concessions!” “Well! Have you now resolved otherwise.” “Why, the truth is, Clarence, it is something ridiculous for either of us to be talking of our future purposes, while in such a predicament as this. Perhaps we had better be at our prayers, preparing for the worst. If half be true that is said of these Black Riders, a short shrift and a sure cord are the most probable of their gifts. We need not quarrel about a woman on the edge of the grave.” “Were death sure and at hand, Edward Conway, my principles should be equally certain, and expressed without fear. Am I to understand that you have resolved to disregard my superior claims, and to pursue Flora Middleton with your attentions.” “Your superior claims, Clarence,” replied the other, “consist, simply, if I understand the matter rightly, in your having seen the lady before myself, and by so many months only having the start of me in our mutual admiration of her charms. I have not learned that she has given you to suppose that she regards you with more favour than she does myself.” A warm flush passed over the before pale features of Clarence Conway. His lip was agitated, and its quivering only suppressed by a strong effort. “Enough, sir!” he exclaimed—“we understand each other.” There was probably some little mockery in the mood of Edward Conway as he urged the matter to a farther point. “But let me know, Clarence. Something of my own course will certainly depend—that is, if I am ever again free from the clutches of these—” The sentence was left unfinished by the speaker, as if through an apprehension that he might have more auditors than the one he addressed. He renewed the sentence, cautiously omitting the offensive member: “Something of my course, Clarence, will surely depend on my knowledge of your claims. If they are superior to mine, or to those of a thousand others—if she has given you to understand that she has a preference—” The flush increased upon the cheek of the younger kinsman as he replied: “Let me do her justice, sir. It is with some sense of shame that I speak again of her in a discussion such as this. Miss Middleton has given me no claim—she has shown me no preference, such as I could build upon for an instant. But, my claim was on you, Edward Conway. You were carried by me to her dwelling. She was made known to you by me; and, before this was done, I had declared to you my own deep interest in her. You saw into the secret and sacred plans of my VOL. I. 9 heart—you heard from my own lips the extent of my affection for her; and—but I can speak no more of this without anger, and anger here is impotence. Take your course, Edward Conway, and assert your desires as you may. Henceforward I understand you, and on this subject beg to be silent.” The hour had elapsed which, by the previous instructions of the outlaw chief, had been accorded to the interview between himself and kinsman. The object of this finesse had, as he believed, been fully answered; and at this stage of the interview his counterfeit presentment made his appearance, with all due terrors of authority, and put an end to a conference which had become excessively irksome to the younger brother. The farce was not yet finished, however. Clarence Conway was the curious witness to a long examination to which his fellow prisoner was subjected, the object of which seemed to be to establish the fact that Edward Conway was himself a most inveterate rebel. A part of this examination may be given. “You do not deny that your name is Conway.” “I do not,” was the reply. “Colonel Conway, of Sumter's Brigade?” “I am Colonel Conway, of Sumter's Brigade,” said Clarence, interposing. “Time enough to answer for yourself when you are asked!—that story won't go down with us, my good fellow,” sternly exclaimed the acting chief of the banditti. “Shumway,” he exclaimed, turning to a subordinate, “why the d—l were these d—d rebels put together? They have been cooking up a story between them, and hanging now will hardly get the truth out of either! We'll see what Muggs can tell us. He should know this fellow Conway.” “Muggs has gone to bed, sir.” “Wake him up and turn him out, at the invitation of a rope's end. I'm suspicious that Muggs is half a rebel himself, he's lived so long in this rascally neighbourhood, and must be looked after.” Shumway disappeared, and the examination proceeded. “Do you still deny that you are Colonel Conway, of Sumter's brigade? Beware now of your answer—we have other rebels to confront you.” The question was still addressed to the elder of the kinsmen. His reply was made with grave composure. “I do. My name is Conway, as I declared to you before; but I am not of Sumter's brigade, nor of any brigade. I am not a colonel, and never hope to be made one.” “Indeed! but you hope to get off with that d—d pack of lies, do you, in spite of all the evidence against you? But you are mistaken. I wouldn't give a continental copper for the safety of your skin, colonel.” “If the commission of Governor Rutledge of South Carolina will be any evidence to show who is, and who is not, Colonel Conway, of Sumter's brigade,” was the second interruption of Clarence, “that commission will be found in my pocket.” “And what will that prove, you d—d rebel, but that it has been slipped from one to the other as you each wanted it. Your shifting commissions are well known make-shifts among you, and we know too well their value to put much faith in them. But can you guess, my dear fellow,” turning to Clarence, “you, who are so anxious to prove yourself a colonel—can you guess what it will cost you to establish the fact? Do you know that a swinging bough will be your first halting-place, and your first bow shall be made to a halter?” “If you think to terrify me by such threats, you are mistaken in your man,” replied Clarence, with features which amply denoted the wholesale scorn within his bosom, “and if you dare to carry your threats into execution, you as little know the men of Sumter's brigade, the meanest of whom would promptly peril his own life to exact fearful and bloody retribution for the deed. I am Colonel Conway, and, dog of a tory, I defy you. Do your worst. I know you dare do nothing of the sort you threaten. I defy and spit upon you.” The face of the outlaw blackened:—Clarence rose to his feet. “Ha! think you so? We shall see. Shumway, Frink, Gasson!—you three are enough to saddle this fiery rebel to his last horse. Noose him, you slow moving scoundrels, to the nearest sapling, and let him grow wiser in the wind. To your work, villains— away!” The hands of more than one of the ruffians were already on the shoulders of the partisan. Though shocked at the seeming certainty of a deed which he had not been willing to believe they would venture to execute, he yet preserved the fearless aspect which he had heretofore shown. His lips still uttered the language of defiance. He made no concessions, he asked for no delay—he simply denounced against them the vengeance of his command, and that of his reckless commander, whose fiery energy of soul and rapidity of execution they well knew. His language tended still farther to exasperate the person who acted in the capacity of the outlaw chief. Furiously, as if to second the subordinates in the awful duty in which they seemed to him to linger, he grasped the throat of Clarence Conway with his own hands, and proceeded to drag him forward. He did not see the significant gesture of head, glance of eye and impatient movement of Edward Conway, while he thundered out his commands and curses. The latter could not, while seeking to preserve the new character in which he had placed himself, take any more decided means to make his wishes understood; and it was with feelings of apprehension and annoyance, new even to himself, that he beheld the prompt savage, to whom he had entrusted the temporary command, about to perform a deed which a secret and mysterious something in his soul would not permit him to authorize or behold, however much he might have been willing to reap its pleasant fruits when done. There was evidently no faltering in the fearful purpose of his representative. Every thing was serious. He was too familiar with such deeds to make him at all heedful of consequences; and the proud bearing of the youth; the unmitigated scorn in his look and language; the hateful words which he had used, and the threats which he had denounced; while they exasperated all around, almost maddened the ruffian in command, to whom such defiance was new, and with whom the taking of life was a circumstance equally familiar and unimportant. “Three minutes for prayer is all the grace I give him!” he cried, hoarsely, as he helped the subordinates to drag the destined victim towards the door. He himself was not suffered one. The speech was scarcely spoken, when he fell prostrate on his face, stricken in the mouth by a rifle-bullet, which entered through an aperture in the wall opposite. His blood and brains bespattered the breast of Clarence Conway, whom his falling body also bore to the floor of the apartment. A wild shout from without followed the shot, and rose, strong and piercing, above all the clamour within. In that shout Clarence could not doubt that he heard the manly voice of the faithful Jack Bannister, and the deed spoke for itself. It could have been the deed of a friend only.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9* CHAPTER IX. A CRISIS. The sensation produced on all the parties by this sudden stroke of retribution was indescribable. The fate of Clarence Conway was suspended for a while. The executioners stood aghast. They relaxed their hold upon the prisoner; all their powers being seemingly paralyzed in amazement and alarm. Tacitly, every eye, with the instinct of an ancient habit, was turned upon Edward Conway. He, too, had partaken, to a large degree, of the excitement of the scene. The old habits of command re-obtained their ascendancy. He forgot, for the instant, the novel position in which he stood; the assumed character which he played, and all the grave mummery of his bondage and disguise. Starting to his feet, when the first feeling of surprise had passed, he shouted aloud in the language of authority. “Away, knaves, and follow. Why do you gape and loiter? Pursue the assassin. Let him not escape you! Away!” He was obeyed by all the troopers present. They rushed headlong from the dwelling with a sanguinary shout. The two brothers, still bound, were left alone together. The paroxysm of passion in the one was over. He was recalled to a consciousness of the wily game he had been playing the moment that he started to his feet and issued his commands. The pressure of the tight cords upon his arms, when he would have extended them to his men, brought back all his memories. In an instant he felt his error, and apprehended the consequences. His eye naturally turned in search of his kinsman, who stood erect, a surprised but calm spectator. He had witnessed the action, had seen the excitement, and heard the language of Edward Conway; but these did not seem to him too extravagant for the temper of one easily moved, who was yet innocent of any improper connexion with the criminals. The circumstances which had taken place were sufficiently exciting to account for these ebullitions, without awakening any suspicions of the truth. It is true that the fierce command, so familiarly addressed to the robbers by their prisoner, did seem strange enough to the unsuspecting Clarence; but even this was natural enough. Nor was it less so that they should so readily obey orders coming from any lips which, to them, conveyed so correctly the instructions to their duty. Besides, the clamour, the uproar, the confusion and hubbub of the scene, not to speak of those conflicting emotions under which Clarence Conway suffered at a moment so full, seemingly, of the last peril to himself, served to distract his senses and impair the just powers of judgment in his mind. He felt that Edward Conway had acted unexpectedly—had shown a singular activity which did not seem exactly called for, and was scarce due to those in whose behalf it was displayed; but, making due allowance for the different effects of fright and excitement upon different temperaments, he did not regard his conduct as strange or unnatural, however unnecessary it might seem, and, perhaps, impolitic. It was the first thought in his mind that Edward Conway, in his great agitation, did not seem to recollect that the assassination which had taken place was probably the only event which could then have saved his life. These reflections did not occur to the mind of the latter. Conscious of equal guilt and indiscretion, the apprehensions of Edward Conway were all awakened for his secret. The lowering and suspicious glance which he watched in the eye of his kinsman, and which had its origin in a portion of the previous conference between them, he was at once ready to ascribe to the discovery, by the latter, of his own criminal connexion with the outlaws. In his anxiety, he was not aware that he had not said enough to declare his true character—that he had only used the language which any citizen might employ without censure, on beholding the performance, by another, of any sudden and atrocious outrage. So impressed was he with the conviction that he had betrayed the whole truth by his imprudence, that the resolution in his mind was partly formed to declare himself boldly and bid defiance to all consequences. What had he now to fear? was his natural reflection. Why should he strive longer to keep terms with one with whom he must inevitably break in the end? Clarence Conway was his rival, was his enemy, and was in his power. He had already felt the humiliation resulting from the unbecoming equivocal position in which he stood to him. He had bowed to him, when he better felt the mood to battle with him. He had displayed the smile of conciliation, when, in his heart, he felt all the bitterness of dislike and hate. Why should he longer seek to maintain appearances with one from whom he now had seemingly nothing to fear? Why not, at once, by a bold avowal of his course, justify, in the language of defiance, the hostile position in which he stood equally to his country and his kinsman? Such a course would amply account for the past; and, in those arguments by which the loyalists of that day found a sanction for their adherence to the mother country, he might well claim all the rights of position due to one, whatever may be his errors of judgment, who draws his sword in behalf of his principles. Such were some of the arguments drawn from the seeming necessity of the case, which rapidly passed through the mind of Edward Conway as he watched the play of mingled surprise and scorn in the features of his kinsman. But they were not conclusive. They were still combated by the last lingering sentiments of humanity and blood. Clarence Conway was still his kinsman, and more than that, he owed him a life. “Besides,” was the language of his second thoughts, “his myrmidons even now may be around us. Let us first see the result of this pursuit.” New apprehensions arose from this last reflection. That the followers of Clarence Conway were not far off was the very natural reflection of every mind, after the sudden and fearful death of him who had been the chosen representative of their chief. That the shot which slew Williams was meant for the chief of the Black Riders, was his own reflection; and it counselled continued prudence for the present. The game which he proposed in prosecuting his purposes equally with Flora Middleton and his brother, was best promoted by his present forbearance—by his still continuing, at least while in the presence of Clarence Conway, to preserve his doubtful position as a prisoner. He sank back, accordingly, upon the bulk from which he had arisen in the first moment of the alarm. His efforts were addressed to the task of composing his features, and assuming the subdued aspect of one who stands in equal doubt and apprehension of his fate. Some moments of anxiety elapsed, in which neither of the kinsmen spoke. Clarence, in the mean time, had also resumed his seat. He no longer looked towards his companion. His heart was filled with apprehension, in which his own fate had no concern. He trembled now for the life of the faithful woodman—for he did not doubt that it was he—who had tracked his footsteps, and so promptly interfered at the hazard of his own life, to exact that of his enemy. The senses of the youth were sharpened to an intense keenness. He could hear the distant clamours of the hunt without. The shouts and shrieks of rage, breaking, as they rose, far above the rush of the winds and the monotonous patterings of the rain. He was roused from an attention at once painful and unavoidable by the accents of his kinsman. “Clarence!” said the latter, “this is a terrible affair— the murder of this man!” “Scarcely so terrible to me;” was the cold reply— “it prolonged my life—the wretch would have murdered me, and I look upon his corse without horror or regret!” “Impossible! His purpose was only to intimidate— he would never have dared the commission of such a crime.” “You are yet to learn the deeds of the Black Riders— you know not how much such outlawed wretches will dare in the very desperation of their hearts.” “That was a dreadful deed, however;—so swift—so sudden—I confess it almost unmanned me. I felt desperate with terror. I know not what I said.” “So I thought,” replied Clarence, “for you actually shouted to the wretches to pursue the murderer, and he, too, that noble fellow, Jack Bannister. He has stood between me and death before. You, also, Edward Conway, owe him a life.” “Do you think it was he, Clarence?” “I have no doubt of it. I am sure of his halloo.” “If they catch him!—” “God forbid that they should!” “If they should not, we shall probably pay for his boldness. They will wreak their fury on our heads, if they be the bloody wretches that you describe them.” “I am prepared for the worst. I am their prisoner, but I fear nothing. I, at least, Edward Conway, am somewhat protected by the rights and usages of war—but you—” “Much good did these rights promise you a few minutes past,” said the other sarcastically, “unless my conjecture be the right one. According to your notion, precious little respect would these men have had for the usages of war. Their own usages, by your showing, have long since legitimated hanging and burning, and such small practices.” “I should not have perished unavenged. Nay, you see already how closely the avenger follows upon the footsteps of the criminal. For every drop of my blood shed unlawfully, there would be a fearful drain from the heart of every prisoner in the hands of Sumter.” “That, methinks, were a sorry satisfaction. To me, I confess, it would afford very little pleasure to be told, while I am swinging, that some one or more of my enemies will share my fate in order that the balance sheet between the two armies may be struck to their mutual satisfaction. My manes on the other side of Styx, will derive small comfort from beholding the ghost of my foe following close behind me, with a neck having a like ugly twist with my own, which he admits having received on my account.” “The jest is a bald one that's born under the gallows,” replied Clarence gravely, with a Whig proverb. “Ay, but I am not there yet,” replied the other; “and with God's blessing I hope that the tree and day are equally far distant which shall witness such an unhappy suspension of my limbs and labours.” “If I stand in such peril,” replied Clarence Conway, “holding as I do a commission from the state authorities, I cannot understand how it can be that you should escape, having, unhappily, no such sanction, and being so much more in danger from their suspicion. I sincerely trust that you will escape, Edward Conway, but you see the perilous circumstances in which you are placed by your unhappy neglect of the proper duties to your country and yourself.” “I am afraid, Clarence, that your commission will hardly prevail upon them to make any difference in their treatment of us.” “And yet, I wish to Heaven, Edward Conway, that both of my father's sons were equally well provided.” “Do you really wish it, Clarence?” “From my soul I do,” was the reply. “Gladly now, could I do so, would I place my commission in your hands.” “Indeed! would you do this, Clarence Conway? Are you serious?” demanded the elder kinsman with looks of considerable interest and surprise. “Serious! Do you know me so little as to make such an inquiry! Would I trifle at such a moment with any man?—Could I trifle so with a kinsman? No! Bound as we both are the desire is idle enough, but, could it be done, Edward Conway, freely would I place the parchment in your hands with all the privileges which belong to it.” “And you—” “Would take my risk—would defy them to the last, and rely upon their fears of that justice which would certainly follow any attempt upon my life while I remain their prisoner.” The chief of the Black Riders rose from the bulk on which he had been seated, and twice, thrice, he paced the apartment without speaking. Deep shadows passed over his countenance, and low muttering sounds, which were not words, escaped at moments through his closed teeth. He seemed to be struggling for a space with some new emotion. At length he stopped short in front of his kinsman. He had succeeded in composing his features, which were now mantled with a smile. “Clarence,” he exclaimed, “you are a very generous fellow. You always were, even in your boyhood. Your proffer to me loses nothing of its liberality because it would be injurious rather than beneficial to me. Your intention is every thing. But, I cannot accept your gift— it would be to me the shirt of Nessus. It would be my death, and if you take my counsel you will say nothing of it. Better by far had you left it in the swamp. Have you forgotten that I am here, under these very bonds, charged with no worse offence than that of being Colonel Clarence Conway. If I could be secure from this imputation, perhaps, I would escape with no worse evil than the scars they have given me.” “True, true! These after matters had driven the other from my thought. I recollect—I had even given my testimony on that head. If it will serve you, I will again repeat the truth, though they hew me down the next instant.” “Say nothing rashly, Clarence. You are as excessively bold as you are generous—every way an extravagant man. Suppress your commission, if you can, for I'm doubtful if it can do you any good with these people, and it may do you serious harm. They make little heed, I fear, of law and parchment. But hark! The shouting becomes nearer and louder. They are returning—they have taken the assassin!” “God forbid!” was the involuntary ejaculation of Clalence, while a cold shudder passed over his frame at the apprehension.—“God forbid! Besides, Edward Conway, he is no assassin.” “Still generous, if not wise!” was the remark of his companion, who added—“Perhaps, Clarence, our only hope of safety depends upon their having their victim.” “I love life—life is precious to me,” said the other, “but it would be a bitterness and a loathing could I feel that it had been purchased by the sacrifice of that worthy fellow.” “We shall soon see. Here they come. Our trial is at hand.” No more words were permitted to either speaker. The uproar of conflicting voices without—the questioning and counselling—the cries and clamours, effectually stunned and silenced the two within. Then came a rush. The door was thrown open, and in poured the troop, with fury, vexation and disappointment. They had failed to track the assassin. The darkness of the night, the prevalence of the storm, and the absence of every trace and track of his footstep, which the rain obliterated as soon as it was set down, served to baffle their efforts and defeat their aim. They returned in a more savage mood of fury than before. They were now madmen. The appetite for blood, provoked by the pursuit, had been increased by the delay. Ben Williams, the man who was slain, was a favourite among the troop. They were prepared to avenge him, and in doing this, to carry out the cruel penalty which he was about to inflict on the prisoner in the moment when he was shot down. Led on by one of the party, by whom Clarence had been originally made prisoner, they rushed upon him. “Out with him at once;” was the cry of the infuriate wretches. “To the tree: to the tree!” “A rope, Muggs!” was the demand of one; and knives flashed about the eyes of the young partisan in fearful proximity. “What would you do, boys?” demanded Muggs interposing. He alone knew the tie which existed between VOL. I. 10 the prisoner and his commander. He also knew, in part at least, the objects for which the latter had put on his disguise. “Let the prisoner alone to-night, and give him a fair trial in the morning.” “Who talks of fair trial in the morning? Look at Ben Williams lying at your foot. You're treading in his blood, and you talking of fair trial to his murderer.” “But this man aint his murderer!” “Same thing—same thing—wa'nt it on his account that he was shot. Away with him to the tree. Away with him!” “Haul him along, fellows! Here, let me lay hand on his collar,” cried a huge fellow from behind. “Give's a hold on him and you'll soon see him out.” A dozen hands grappled with the youth. A dozen more contended that they might do so likewise. “Scoundrels, give me but room, and I will follow you,” cried Clarence with a scorn as lofty as he would have shown in a station of the utmost security, and with tones as firm as he ever uttered at the head of his regiment. “If nothing but my blood can satisfy you for that which is shed, take it. You shall not see me shrink from any violence which your ruffian hands may inflict. Know that I despise and defy you to the last.” “Gag him—stop his mouth. Shall the rebel flout us on our own ground.” “Bring him forward. The blood of Ben Williams cries out to us;—why do you stand with open mouths there. Shove him ahead.” Amid such cries as these, coupled with the most shocking oaths and imprecations, they dragged forward the youth slowly, for their own numbers and conflicting violence prevented co-operation. They dragged him on until, at length, he stood in the blood, and just above the body, of the murdered man. He did not struggle, but he shrunk back naturally, with some horror, when he felt the clammy substance sticking to his feet. He readily conjectured whence it came—from what sacred sources of human life;—and, though a fearless soldier—one who, in the heat of battle, had often shed the blood of his enemy—yet the nature within him recoiled at the conviction that he stood in a puddle, which, but a little time before, had beat and bounded, all animation and strength and passion, in the bosom of a living man. His shuddering recoil was mistaken by the crowd for resistance, and one ruffian, more brutal than the rest, renewing his grasp with one hand upon the collar of the youth, with the other struck him in the face. The blow, that last indignity and violence to which the man submits, roused the swelling tides in the bosom of the youth beyond their wonted bounds. With an effort which seemed rather an emotion of the soul than a physical endeavour, he put forth his whole strength, and the cords snapped asunder which had confined his arms, and with the rapidity of lightning he retorted the blow with such sufficient interest as prostrated the assailant at his feet. “Now, scoundrels, if you must have blood, use your knives—for no rope shall profane my neck while I have soul to defy and power to resist you. Dogs, bloodhounds that you are, I scorn, I spit upon you. Bring forth your best man—your chief, if you have one to take the place of this carcass at my feet, that I may revile and defy, and spit upon him also.” A moment's pause ensued. The noble air of the man whom they environed—the prodigious strength which he had shown in snapping asunder the strong cords which secured his limbs, commanded their admiration. Courage and strength will always produce this effect, in the minds of savage men. They beheld him with a momentary pause of wonder; but shame to be thus baffled by a single man, lent them new audacity. They rushed upon him. Without weapons of any kind, for he had been disarmed when first made a captive, they had no occasion to resort to that degree of violence in overcoming him, to which he evidently aimed to provoke them. It was his obvious desire to goad them on to the use of weapons which would take life and thus effectually defeat their purpose of consigning him to the gallows;—that degrading form of death from which the gentle mind shrinks with a revulsion which the fear of the sudden stroke or the swift shot, could never occasion. Hence the abusive and strong language which he employed—language otherwise unfamiliar to his lips. His desire might still have been gratified. Several of the more violent among the young men of the party were rushing on him with uplifted hands, in which the glittering blade was flashing and conspicuous. But the scornful demand of Clarence, with which he concluded his contumelious speech, brought a new party into the field. This was no other than his kinsman. He had been a looker on for some moments— not long—for the whole scene took far less time for performance than it now takes for narration. He had watched its progress with new and rather strange emotions. At one moment, the selfish desires of his heart grew predominant. He thought of Flora Middleton, and he sank back and closed his eyes upon the objects around him, saying, in his secret heart—“Let them go on—let him perish—why should I preserve from destruction the only obstacle to my desires.” At the next moment, a better spirit prevailed within him. He remembered the services of Clarence to himself.—He owed to him his life; and but now, had not the generous youth tendered him for his extrication and sole use that document, which he fancied would be all powerful in securing his own safety. The image of their mutual father came, also, to goad the unworthy son to a sense of his duty, and when he heard the fierce, proud accents of the youth—when he heard him call for “their best man, their chief, that he might defy and spit upon him,” he started to his feet. There was but a moment left him for performance if his purpose was to save. The knives of the infuriate mob were already flourishing above their victim, and in their eyes might be seen that fanatical expression of fury which is almost beyond human power to arrest. A keen, quick, meaning glance, he gave to the landlord, Muggs; whose eyes had all the while been anxiously watchful of his leader. At the sign the latter made his way behind him, and, unobserved, with a single stroke of his knife, separated the cord which bound his arms. In another instant his voice rose superior to all their clamours. “Hold, on your lives!” he exclaimed, leaping in among the assailants. “Back, instantly, fellows, or you make an enemy of me! Let the prisoner alone!” “Gad, I'm so glad!” exclaimed Muggs, while the big drops of perspiration poured down his forehead. “I thought, cappin, you couldn't stand by, and see them make a finish of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10* CHAPTER X SHADOWS OF COMING EVENTS. “Hold, comrades, you have done enough. Leave the prisoner to me! Colonel Conway, you demanded to look upon the chief of the Black Riders. He is before you. He answers, at last, to your defiance.” And with these words, with a form rising into dignity and height, in becoming correspondence, as it were, with the novel boldness of his attitude, Edward Conway stood erect and confronted his kinsman. In the bosom of the latter a thousand feelings were at conflict. Vexation at the gross imposition which had been practised upon him— scorn at the baseness of the various forms of subterfuge which the other had employed in his serpent-like progress; but, more than all, the keen anguish which followed a discovery so humiliating, in the bosom of one so sensible to the purity of the family name and honour—all combined to confound equally his feelings and his judgment. But his reply was not the less prompt for all this. “And him, thus known, I doubly scorn, defy and spit upon!” He had not time for more. Other passions were in exercise beside his own; and Edward Conway was taught to know, by what ensued, if the truth were unknown to him before, that it is always a far less difficult task to provoke, than to quiet, frenzy—to stimulate, than to subdue, the ferocity of human passions, when at the flood. A fool may set the wisest by the ears, but it is not the wisest always who can restore them to their former condition of sanity and repose. The congratulations of Muggs, the landlord, which, by the way, spoke something in his behalf, promised for a while to be without sufficient reason. The captain of the Black Riders met with unexpected resistance among his troop. The murdered man had been a favourite, and they were not apt to be scrupulous about avenging the death of such among their comrades as were. Even at a time when a moderate degree of reason prevailed among them, it was not easy to subdue them to placability and forbearance in regard to a prisoner; the very name of whom, according to their usual practice, was synonymous with victim. How much less so, at this juncture, when, with their blood roused to tiger rage, they had been suffered to proceed to the very verge of indulgence, before any effort, worthy of the name, on the part of an acknowledged superior, had been made to arrest them! Edward Morton felt his error, in delaying his interposition so long. If his purpose had been to save, his effort should have been sooner made, and then it might have been effected without the more serious risk which now threatened himself, in the probable diminution of his authority. He estimated his power too highly, and flattered himself that he could at any moment interpose with effect. He made no allowance for that momentum of the blood, which, in the man aroused by passion and goaded to fury, resists even the desires of the mind accustomed to control it; even as the wild beast, after he has lashed himself into rage, forgets the keeper by whom he is fed and disciplined, and rends him with the rest. Edward Morton stood erect and frowning among those whom he was accustomed to command—and their obedience was withheld! His orders were received with murmurs by some —with sullenness by all. They still maintained their position—their hands and weapons uplifted—their eyes glaring with savage determination;—now fixed on their threatened victim, and now on their commander; and without much difference in their expression when surveying either. “Do ye murmur—are ye mutinous? Ha! will ye have me strike, men; that ye fall not back? Is it you, Barton, and you, Fisher.—You, of all, that stand up in resistance to my will! Ensign Darcy, it will best become you to give me your prompt obedience. I have not forgotten your connexion with Lieutenant Stockton. Fall back, sir—do not provoke me to anger: do not any of you provoke me too far!” The man addressed as Barton—a huge fellow who made himself conspicuous by his clamours from the first —replied in a style which revealed to Morton the full difficulties of his position. “Look you, Captain Morton, I'm one that is always for obedience when the thing's reasonable; but here's a case where it's onreasonable quite. We aint used to see one of us shot down without so much as drawing blood for it. Ben Williams was my friend; and, for that matter, he was a friend with every fellow of the troop. I, for one, can't stand looking at his blood, right afore me, and see his enemy standing t'other side, without so much as a scratch. As for the obedience, Captain, why there's time enough for that when we've done hanging the rebel.” “It must be now, Mr. Barton. Muggs, that pistol! Stand by me with your weapon. Men, I make you one appeal! I am your Captain! All who are still willing that I should be so, will follow Muggs. Muggs—behind me. March! By the God of Heaven, Mr. Barton, this moment tries our strength. You or I must yield. There is but a straw between us. There is but a moment of time for either! Lower your weapon, sir, or one of us, in another instant, lies with Ben Williams.” The huge horseman's pistol which Muggs handed to his leader at his requisition, had been already cocked by the landlord. It was lifted while Morton was speaking—deliberately lifted—and the broad muzzle was made to rest full against the face of the refractory subordinate. The instant was full of doubt and peril, and Clarence Conway forgot for the time his own danger in the contemplation of the issue. But the courage of the moral man prevailed over the instinct of blood. Edward Morton saw that he was about to triumph. The eye of the fierce mutineer sunk beneath his own, though its angry fires were by no means quenched. It still gleamed with defiance and rage, but no longer with resolution. The fellow looked round upon his comrades. They had shrunk back—they were no longer at his side, and no small number had followed the landlord and were now ranged on either side of their Captain. Of those who had not taken this decided movement, he saw the irresoluteness, and his own necessarily increased. It is this dependence upon sympathy and association which constitutes one of the essential differences between the vulgar and the educated mind. Brutal and bold as he was, Barton was not willing to be left alone. The chief of the Black Riders saw that the trial was fairly over—the strife had passed. The evil spirit was laid for the present, and there was no longer any thing to fear. “Enough!” he exclaimed, lowering his weapon, and acting with a better policy than had altogether governed his previous movements. “Enough! You know me, Barton, and I think I know you. You are a good fellow at certain seasons, but you have your blasts and your hurricanes, and do not always know when to leave off the uproar. You will grow wiser, I trust, but meanwhile you must make some effort to keep your passions in order. This rough treatment of your friends, as if they were foes, won't answer. Beware. You have your warning.” “Yes,” growled the ruffian, doggedly, still unwilling altogether to submit; “but when our friends stand up for our foes, and take sides against us, I think its reasonable enough to think there's not much difference between 'em, as you say. I'm done, but I think it's mighty hard now-a-days that we can't hang a rebel and a spy, without being in danger of swallowing a bullet ourselves. And then, too, poor Ben Williams. Is he to lie there in his blood, and nothing to be done to his enemy?” “I say not that, Mr. Barton. The prisoner shall have a trial; and if you find him guilty of connexion with the man who shot Williams, you may then do as you please. I have no disposition to deprive you of your victim; but know from me, that, while I command you, you shall obey me—ay, without asking the why and wherefore! I should be a sorry captain—nay, you would be a sorry troop—if I suffered your insubordination for an instant. Away, now, and make the circuit —all of you but Shumway and Irby. See to your powder, that it be kept dry; and let your horses be in readiness for a start at dawn. This country is too hot for you already; and with such management as you have had in my absence, it would become seven times hotter. Away.” They disappeared, all but the two who were excepted by name. To these he delivered the prisoner. “Shumway, do you and Irby take charge of the rebel. Lodge him in the block, and let him be safely kept till I relieve you. Your lives shall answer for his safety. Spare none who seek to thwart you. Were he the best man in the troop who approached you suspiciously, shoot him down like a dog.” In silence the two led Clarence Conway out of the house. He followed them in silence. He looked once toward his kinsman, but Edward Morton was not yet prepared to meet his glance. His head was averted as the former was followed by his guards to the entrance. Clarence was conducted to an out-house—a simple, but close, block-house, of squared logs—small, and of little use as a prison, except as it was secluded from the highway. Its value, as a place of safe keeping, consisted simply in its obscurity. Into this he was thrust headlong, and the door fastened from without upon him. There let us leave him for a while, to meditate upon the strange and sorrowful scene which he had witnessed, and of which he had been a part. His reflections were not of a nature to permit him to pay much attention to the accommodations which were afforded him. He found himself in utter darkness, and the inability to employ his eyes led necessarily to the greater exercise of his thoughts. He threw himself upon the floor of his dungeon, which was covered with pine straw, and brooded over the prospects of that life which had just passed through an ordeal so narrow. Let us now return to his kinsman. Edward Morton had now resumed all the duties of his station as chief of the Black Riders. In this capacity, and just at this time, his tasks, as the reader will readily imagine, were neither few in number nor easy of performance. It required no small amount of firmness, forethought and adroitness, to keep in subjection, and govern to advantage, such unruly spirits. But the skill of their captain was not inconsiderable, and such were the very spirits whom he could most successfully command. The coarser desires of the mind, and the wilder passions of the man, he could better comprehend than any other. With these he was at home. But with these his capacity was at an end. Beyond these, and with finer spirits, he was usually at fault. To be the successful leader of ruffians is, perhaps, a small merit. It requires cunning rather than wisdom to be able simply to discover the passion which it seeks to use, and this was the chief secret of Edward Morton. He knew how to make hate, and jealousy, and lust, and fear, subservient to his purposes, already roused into action. It is doubtful even whether he possessed the cold-blooded talent of Iago, to awaken them from their slumbers, breathe into them the breath of life, and send them forward, commissioned like so many furies, for the destruction of their wretched victim. A sample has been given already of the sort of trial which awaited him in the control of his comrades. But there were other difficulties which tasked his powers to the utmost. The difficulties which environed the whole British army were such as necessarily troubled, in a far greater degree, its subordinate commands. The duties of these were more constant, more arduous, and liable to more various risk and exposure. The unwonted successes of the American arms had awakened all the slumbering patriotism of the people; while the excesses, of which such parties as that which Morton commanded, had been guilty, in the hey-day of their reckless career, had roused passions in the bosom of their foes, which, if better justified, were equally violent, and far less likely, once awakened, to relapse into slumber. Revenge was busy with all her train in search of himself and the gloomily caparisoned troop which he led. It was her array from which he so narrowly escaped when he received the timely succour of his kinsman in the swamp. An hundred small bodies like his own had suddenly started into existence and activity around him, some of which had almost specially devoted themselves to the destruction of his troop. The wrongs of lust, and murder, and spoliation, were about to be redressed; and by night as by day was he required to keep his troop in motion, if for no other object than his own safety; though, by this necessity, he was compelled to traverse a country which had been devastated by the wanton hands of those whom he commanded. On the same track, and because of the same provocation, were scattered hundreds of enemies, as active in pursuit and search as he was in evasion. He well knew the fate which awaited him if caught, and involuntarily shuddered as he thought of it: —death in its most painful form—torture fashioned by the most capricious exercise of ingenuity—scorn, ignominy and contumely, the most bitter and degrading, which stops not even at the gallows, and, as far as it may, stamps the sign of infamy upon the grave. These were, in part, the subject of the gloomy meditations of the outlawed chief when left alone in the wigwam of Muggs, the landlord. True, he was not without his resources—his disguises—his genius! He had been so far wonderfully favoured by fortune, and his hope was an active, inherent principle in his organization. But the resources of genius avail not always, and even the sanguine temperament of Edward Morton was disposed to reserve, while listening to the promises of fortune. He knew the characteristic caprices in which she was accustomed to indulge. He was no blind believer in her books. He was too selfish a man to trust her implicitly; though, hitherto, she had fulfilled every promise that she had ever made him. The signs of a change were visible to his senses. He had his doubts and misgivings; he was not without audacity—he could dare with the boldest; but his daring had usually been shown at periods, when to dare was to be cautious. He meditated even now to distrust the smiles of fortune in season—to leave the field of adventure while it was still possible and safe to do so. His meditations were interrupted at this moment, and, perhaps, assisted, by no less a person than Muggs, the landlord. He made his appearance, after a brief visit to an inner shanty—a place of peculiar privity—the sanctum sanctorum, in which the landlord wisely put away from sight such stores as he wished to preserve from that maelstrom, the common stock. The landlord was one of the few who knew the secret history of the two Conways; and though he knew not all, he knew enough to form a tolerably just idea of the feelings with which the elder regarded the younger kinsman. He could form a notion, also, of the sentiments by which they were requited. In Muggs, Edward Morton had reason to believe that he had a sure friend—one before whom he might safely venture to unbosom some of his reserves. Still he was especially careful to show not all, nor the most important—none, in fact, the revelation of which could possibly be productive of any very serious injury or inconvenience. He, perhaps, did little more than stimulate the communicative disposition of “mine host,” who, like most persons of his craft, was garrulous by profession, and fancied that he never ministered perfectly to the palates of his guests, unless when he accompanied the service by a free exercise of his own tongue. “Well, cappin, the game of fox and goose is finished now, I reckon. There's no chance to play possum with your brother any longer. It's lion and tiger now, if any thing.” “I suppose so,” replied the other, with something of a sigh. The landlord continued: “The question now, I reckon—now, that you've go him in your clutches—is what you're to do with him VOL. I. 11 To my thinking, it's jest the sort of question that bothered the man when he shook hands with the black bear round the tree. It was a starve to hold on and a squeeze to let go, and danger to the mortal ribs which ever way he took it.” “You have described the difficulty, Muggs,” said the other, musingly,—“what to do with him is the question.” “There's no keeping him here, that's cl'ar.” “No. That's impossible!” “His friends, I reckon, are nigh enough to get him out of the logbox, and it's cl'ar they know where to find him. That shot that tumbled poor Williams was mighty nigh and mighty sudden, and was sent by a bold fellow. I'm onsatisfied but there was more than one.” “No,—but one,” said Morton,—“but one!” “Well, cappin, how do you count? There wa'n't no track to show a body where to look for him. The wash made the airth smooth again in five shakes after the foot left the print.” “It's guesswork with me only, Muggs.” “And who do you guess t'was, cappin?” “Supple Jack!” “Well, I reckon you're on the right trail. It's reasonable enough. I didn't once think of him. But it's cl'ar enough to every body that knows the man, that Supple Jack's jest the lad to take any risk for a person he loves so well. But, you don't think he come alone? I'm dub'ous the whole troop aint mighty fur off.” “But him, Muggs! He probably came alone. We left him, only an hour before I came, on the edge of the Wateree—a few miles above this. He and Clarence gave me shelter in the swamp when I was chased by Butler's men, and when that skulking scoundrel, Stockton, left me to perish. Clarence rode on with me, and left Supple Jack to return to the swamp, where they have a first rate hiding place. I suspect he did not return, but followed us. But of this we may speak hereafter. The question is, what to do with the prisoner —this bear whom I have by the paws, and whom it is equally dangerous to keep and to let go.” “Well, that's what I call a tight truth; but it's a sort of satisfaction, cappin, that you've still got the tree a-tween you; and so you may stop a while to consider. Now, I aint altogether the person to say what's what, and how it's to be done; but if so be I can say any thing to make your mind easy, cappin, you know I'm ready.” “Do, Muggs: let us hear you,” was the reply of the outlaw, with the musing manner of one who listens with his ears only, and is content to hear every thing, if not challenged to find answer. “Well, cappin, I'm thinking jest now we're besot all round with troubles; and there's no telling which is biggest, closest, and ugliest—they're all big, and close, and ugly. As for hiding Clarence Conway here, now, or for a day more, that's unpossible. It's cl'ar he's got his friends on the track, one, or mout-be, a hundred; and they can soon muster enough to work him out of the timbers, if it's only by gnawing through with their teeth. Well, how are you to do then? Send him under guard to Camden? Why, it's a chance if all your troop can carry themselves there, without losing their best buttons by the way. It's a long road, and the rebels watch it as close as hawks do the farm-yard in chicken season. That, now, is about the worst sign for the king's side that I've seed for a long spell of summers. It shows pretty cl'ar that we aint so strong as we was a-thinking. The wonder is, where these troopers come from; and the worst wonder is, where they get their boldness. Once on a time, when Tarleton first begun to ride among us, it was more like a driving of deer than a fighting of men; but it seems to me that the rebels have got to be the drivers, and o' late days they scamper us mightily. I see these things better than you, cappin, and, perhaps, better than the rebels themselves; for I aint in the thick, I'm jest like one that's a-standing on a high hill and looking down at the fighting when it's a-going on below. I tell you, cappin, the game's going agen the king's people. They're a-losing ground—these men's getting fewer and fewer every day, and jest so fast I hear of a new gathering among the whigs. I tell you agen, cappin, you're besot with troubles.” “I know it, Muggs. Your account of the case is an accurate one. We are in a bad way.” “By jingo, you may say so, cappin. You are, as I may say, in a mighty bad way—a sort of conflustration, that it puzzles my old head more than I can tell rightly, to onbefluster. Then, as for the prisoner—” “Ay, that, Muggs. Speak to that. What of him? —let me hear your advice about the prisoner. How is he to be disposed of?” “Well now, cappin—there's a-many ways for doing that, but which is the right and proper one—and when it's done, will it sarve the purpose? I'm afeard not— I'm not knowing to any way how to fix it so as to please you. It's pretty sartain he's your enemy in war and your enemy in peace; and if all things that's said be true, about him and Miss Flora, it don't seem to me that you'd ha' been any worse off—if so be your father had never given you this brother for a companion.” The outlaw chief looked up for the first time during the interview, and his eye full of significance encountered that of the landlord. “Ay, Muggs, the gift was a fatal one to me. Better —far better—for me had he never seen the light; or, seeing it, that some friendly foe had closed it from his eyes, while he—while we were both—in a state of innocence.” “Gad, captain, I was thinking at one time to-night that black Barton would have done you a service like that; and I was a-thinking jest then, that you wa'nt unwilling. You kept so long quiet, that I was afeard you'd have forgotten the bloodkin, and let the boys had the game their own way.” “You were afraid of it, were you?” said Morton, his brow darkening as he spoke. “Ay, that I was, mightily. When I thought of the temptations, you know;—Miss Flora and her property, —and then the fine estates he got by his mother's side and all that was like to fall to you, if once he was out of the way—I begun to tremble—for I thought you couldn't stand the temptation. `He's only to keep quiet now and say nothing, and see what he'll get for only looking on.' That was the thought that troubled me. I was afeard, as I tell you, that you'd forget blood-kin and every thing when you come to consider these temptations.” The outlaw rose and strode the floor impatiently. “No, no, Muggs, you had little cause to fear. He had just saved my life—sheltered me from my enemies —nay, would have yielded me his own commission as a protection, which he supposed would be effectual for his own or my safety. No, no! I could not suffer it. Yet, as you say, great, indeed, would have been the gain—great was the temptation.” “True, cappin, but what's the gain that a man gits by bloodying his hands agin natur'? Now, it's not onreasonable or onnatural, when you have tumbled an open enemy in a fair scratch, to see after his consarns, and empty his fob and pockets. But I don't think any good could go with the gain that's spotted with the blood of one's own brother—” “He's but a half-brother, Muggs,” said Morton, hastily. “Different mothers, you recollect.” “Well, I don't see that there's a-much difference, cappin. He's a full brother by your father's side.” “Yes, yes!—but Muggs, had he been slain by Barton and the rest, the deed would have been none of mine. It was a chance of war, and he's a soldier.” “Well, cappin, I'm not so certain about that. There's a difference I know, but—” “It matters not! He lives! He is spared, Muggs— spared, perhaps, for the destruction of his preserver. I have saved his life; but he knows my secret. That secret!—That fatal secret! Would to God!—” He broke off the exclamation abruptly, while he struck his head with his open palm. 11* “My brain is sadly addled, Muggs. Give me something—something which will settle it and compose my nerves. You are happy, old fellow—you are happy, and—safe! The rebels have forgiven you—have they not?” “Well, we have forgiven each other, cappin, and I have found them better fellows nigh, than they were at a distance;” replied the landlord, while he concocted for the outlaw a strong draught of punch, the favourite beverage of the time and country. “If I aint happy, cappin, it's nobody's fault but my own. I only wish you were as safe with all your gettings as I think myself with mine; and you might be—” A look of much significance concluded the sentence. “How,—what would you say, Muggs?” demanded the outlaw, with some increase of anxiety in his manner. The reply of the landlord was whispered in his ears. “Would to heaven I could!—but how?—How, Muggs, is this to be done?” The answer was again whispered. “No, no!” replied the other, with a heavy shake of the head. “I would not, and I dare not. They have stood by me without fear or faithlessness, and I will not now desert them. But enough of this for the present. Get me your lantern, while I seek this brother of mine in private. There must be some more last words between us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE TRUE ISSUE. Preceded by the landlord, Muggs, who carried a dark lantern, Morton took his way to the secluded block-house in which his kinsman was a prisoner. The only entrance to this rude fabric was closely watched by the two persons to whom Clarence was given in charge. These found shelter beneath a couple of gigantic oaks which stood a little distance apart from one another, yet sufficiently nigh to the block-house to enable the persons in their shadow, while themselves perfectly concealed, to note the approach of any intruder. Dismissing them to the tavern, the chief of the Black Riders assigned to Muggs the duty of the watch, and having given him all necessary instructions, he entered the prison, the door of which was carefully fastened behind him by the obedient landlord. The lantern which he bore, and which he set down in one corner of the apartment, enabled Clarence to distinguish his brother at a glance; but the youth neither stirred nor spoke as he beheld him. His mind, in the brief interval which had elapsed after their violent separation in the tavern, had been busily engaged in arriving at that stage of stern resignation, which left him comparatively indifferent to any evils which might then occur. Unable to form any judgment upon the course of his brother's future conduct, he was not prepared to say how far he might be willing to go, and how soon, in permitting to his sanguinary troop the indulgence of their bloody will. Wisely, then, he had steeled his mind against the worst, resolved, if he had to suffer death in an obscurity so little desired by the youthful and ambitious heart, to meet its bitter edge with as calm a countenance as he should like to display under a similar trial, in the presence of a thousand spectators. Edward Morton had evidently made great efforts to work his mind up to a similar feeling of stern indifference; but he had not been so successful, although, at the moment, untroubled by any of those apprehensions which were sufficiently natural to the situation of his brother. His face might have been seen to vary in colour and expression as his eye turned upon the spot where Clarence was sitting. The moral strength was wanting in his case which sustained the latter. The consciousness of guilt enfeebled, in some degree, a spirit, whose intense selfishness alone, were he unpossessed of any other more decisive characteristics, must have been the source of no small amount of firmness and courage. As if ashamed, however, of his feebleness, and determined to brave the virtue which he still felt himself compelled to respect, he opened the conference by a remark, the tone and tenor of which were intended to seem exulting and triumphant. “So, Colonel Conway, you find your wisdom has been at fault. You little fancied that you were half so intimate with that fierce bandit—that renowned chieftain, of whom report speaks so loudly. It does not need that I should introduce you formally to the captain of the Black Riders of Congaree.” The youth looked up and fixed his eye steadily on that of the speaker. Severe, indeed, but full of a manly sorrow, was the expression of that glance. “Edward Conway,” he replied, after a brief delay, “you do not deceive me by that tone—nay, you do not deceive yourself. Your heart, instead of exultation, feels at this moment nothing but shame. Your eye gazes not steadily on mine. Your spirit is not that of a fearless man. You shrink, Edward Conway, in spite of your assumed boldness, with all the cowardice of a guilty soul.” “Cowardice!—do you charge me with cowardice?” “Ay, what else than cowardice has made you descend to the subterfuge and the trick—to the base disguise and the baser falsehood? These, too, to your brother, even at the moment when he was risking his own life to rescue that which you have dishonoured for ever.” “I will prove to you, in due season, that I am no coward, Clarence Conway,” replied the other, in hoarse and nearly undistinguishable accents; “you, at least, are seeking to convince me that you are none, in thus bearding the lion in his den.” “The lion! Shame not that noble beast by any such comparison. The fox will better suit your purpose and performance.” With a strong effort the outlaw kept down his temper, while he replied: “I will not suffer you to provoke me, Clarence Conway. I have sought you for a single object, and that I will perform. After that—that over—and the provocation shall be met and welcomed. Now!—” The other fiercely interrupted him, as he exclaimed: “Now, be it if you will. Free my hands—cut asunder these degrading bonds which you have fixed upon the arms whose last offices were employed in freeing yours, and in your defence, and here, in this dungeon, breast to breast, let us carry out that strife to its fit completion, which your evil passion, your cupidity, or hate, have so dishonestly begun. I know not, Edward Conway, what perversity of heart has brought you to this wretched condition—to the desertion of your friends, your country—the just standards of humanity —the noble exactions of truth. You have allied yourself to the worst of ruffians, in the worst of practices, without even the apology of that worst of causes which the ordinary tory pleads in his defence. You cannot say that your loyalty to the king prompts you to the side you have taken, for I myself have heard you declare against him a thousand times; unless, indeed, I am to understand that even ere we left the hearth and burial-place of our father, you had begun that career of falsehood in which you have shown yourself so proficient. But I seek not for the causes of your present state; for the wrongs and the dishonour done me. If you be not utterly destitute of manhood, cut these bonds, and let the issue for life or death between us determine which is right.” “There! You have your wish, Clarence Conway.” And as he spoke, he separated the cords with his hunting-knife, and the partisan extended his limbs in all the delightful consciousness of recovered freedom. “You are so far free, Clarence Conway! your limbs are unbound, but you are unarmed. I restore you the weapon with which you this day provided me. It would now be easy for you to take the life of him whom you so bitterly denounce. I have no weapon to defend myself; my bosom is without defence.” “What mean you? Think you that I would rush on you unarmed—that I seek unfair advantage?” “No, Clarence—for your own sake and safety, I would not fight you now.” “Why for my safety?” demanded the partisan. “For the best of reasons. Were you to succeed in taking my life, it would avail you nothing, and your own would be forfeit. You could not escape from this place, and fifty weapons would be ready to avenge my death.” “Why, then, this mockery—this cutting loose my bonds—this providing me with weapons?” demanded Clarence. “You shall see. You know not yet my desire. Hear me. My purpose is to acquit myself wholly of the debt I owe you, so that, when we do meet, there shall be nothing to enfeeble either of our arms, or diminish their proper execution. Once to-night I have saved you, even at the peril of my own life, from the fury of my followers. I have already severed your bonds. I have restored your weapon, and before the dawn of another day, the fleet limbs of your own charger shall secure your freedom. This done, Clarence Conway, I shall feel myself acquitted of all those burdensome obligations which, hitherto, have made me suppress the natural feelings of my heart—the objects of my mind—the purposes of interest, ambition, love— all of which depend upon your life. So long as you live, I live not—so long as you breathe, my breath is drawn with doubt, difficulty, and in danger. Your life has been in my hands, but I could not take it while I was indebted to you for my own. By to-morrow's dawn I shall be acquitted of the debt—I shall have given you life for life, and liberty for liberty. After that, when we next meet, my gifts shall be scorn for scorn and blow for blow. You have my purpose.” Clarence Conway heard him with patience, but with mixed feelings. He was about to reply in a similar spirit, but a nobler sentiment arose in his bosom with the momentary pause which he allowed himself for thought. He kept down the gushing blood which was about to pour itself forth in defiance from his labouring breast, and spoke as follows: “I will not say, Edward Conway, what I might safely utter, of my own indifference to your threats. Nay, were I to obey the impulses which are now striving within me for utterance, I should rather declare how happy it would make me were the hour of that struggle arrived. But there are reasons that speak loudly against the wish. For your sake, for our father's sake, Edward Conway, I would pray that we might never meet again.” “Pshaw,—these are whining follies! The cant of the girl or the puritan. They do not impose on me. Thy father's sake and mine, indeed! Say nothing for yourself—for your own sake—oh, no! no! you have no considerations of self—none. Philanthropic, patriotic gentleman!” The keen eye of Clarence flashed scornfully as he listened to this sneer. He bit his lip to restrain his emotion, and once more replied, but it was no longer in the language of forbearance. “I am not unwilling to say for my sake also, Edward Conway. Even to you, I need not add, that no mean sentiment of fear governs me in the expression. Fear I have of no man. Fear of you, Edward Conway, —you, in your present degraded attitude and base condition—the leagued with ruffians and common stabbers —a traitor and a liar!—Fear of you I could not have! Nor do you need that I should tell you this. You feel it in your secret soul. You know that I never feared you in boyhood, and cannot fear you now. My frequent experience of your powers and my own, makes me as careless of your threats, as that natural courage which belongs to my blood and mind makes me insensible to the threats of others. Go to—you cannot bully me. I scorn—I utterly despise you.” “Enough, enough, Colonel Conway. We understand each other,” cried the outlaw, almost convulsed with his emotions. “We are quits from this hour. Henceforward I fling the ties of blood to the winds. As I do not feel them, I will not affect them. I acknowledge them no more. I am not your father's son—not your brother. I forswear, and from this moment I shall for ever deny the connexion. I have no share in the base puddle which fills your veins. Know me, henceforth, for a nobler spirit. I glory in the name which scarces your puny legions. I am the chief of the Black Riders of Congaree—that fell banditti which makes your women shiver and your warriors shake,—upon whom you invoke and threaten vengeance equally in vain. I care not to be distinguished by any other name or connexion. You I shall only know as one to whom I am pledged for battle, and whom I am sworn to destroy. You know not, forsooth, what has driven me to this position! I will tell you here, once for all, and the answer, I trust, will conclude your doubts for ever. Hate for you—for you only! I hated you from your cradle with an instinct which boyhood hourly strengthened, and manhood rendered invincible. I shall always hate you; and if I have temporized, heretofore, and forborne the declaration of the truth, it was only the more effectually to serve and promote purposes which were necessary to that hate. That time, and the necessity of forbearance are at an end. I can speak, and speak freely, the full feeling of my soul. Accident has revealed to you what, perhaps, I should have wished for a while longer to withhold; but that known, it is now my pride to have no farther concealments. I repeat, therefore, that I loathe you from my soul, Clarence Conway, and when I have fairly acquitted myself of the debt I owe you, by sending you to your swamp in safety, I shall then seek, by every effort, to overcome and destroy you. Do you hear me—am I at last understood?” “I hear you,” replied Clarence Conway, with a tone calm, composed, even; and with looks unmoved, and even sternly contemptuous. “I hear you. Your violence does not alarm me, Edward Conway. I look upon you as a madman. As for your threats! Pshaw, man! You almost move me to deal in clamours like your own. Let us vapour here no longer. I accept your terms. Give me my freedom, and set all your ruffians on the track. I make no promise—I utter no threat— but if I fail to take sweet revenge for the brutal outrages to which I have this night been subjected by you and all, then may Heaven fall me in my dying hour.” “We are pledged, Clarence Conway,” said the outlaw; “before daylight I will conduct you from this place. Your horse shall be restored to you. You shall be free. I then know you no more—I fling from me the name of kinsman.” “Not more heartily than I. Black Rider, bandit, outlaw, or ruffian! I shall welcome you to the combat by any name sooner than that which my father has made sacred in my ears.” Morton bestowed a single glance on the speaker, in which all the hellish hate spoke out which had so long VOL. I. 12 been suppressed, yet working in his bosom. The latter met the glance with one more cool and steady, if far less full of malignity. “Be it then as he wills it!” he exclaimed, when the outlaw had retired; “he shall find no foolish tenderness hereafter in my heart, working for his salvation! If we must meet—if he will force it upon me, then God have mercy upon us both, for I will have none! It is his own seeking. Let him abide it! And yet, would to God that this necessity may pass me by! Some other arm—some other weapon than mine may do me justice, and acquit me of this cruel duty!” Long and earnest that night was the prayer of Clarence, that he might be spared from that strife which, so far, threatened to be inevitable. Yet he made not this prayer because of any affection—which, under the circumstances, must have been equally misplaced and unnatural—which he bore his kinsman. They had never loved. The feelings of brotherhood had been unfelt by either. Their moods had been warring from the first—it does not need that we should inquire why. The sweet dependencies of mutual appeal and confidence were unknown to, and unexercised by, either; and, so far as their sympathies were interested, Clarence, like the other, would have felt no more scruple at encountering Edward Conway in battle, than in meeting any indifferent person who was equally his own and the foe of his country. But there was something shocking to the social sense in such a conflict which prompted the prayers of the youth that it might be averted; and this prayer, it may be added, was only made when the excitement which their conference had induced, was partly over. His prayer was one of reflection and the mind. His blood took no part in the entreaty. At moments, when feeling, moved by memory, obtained the ascendency—even while he strove in prayer—the boon which he implored was forgotten, and, rising from his knees, he thought of nothing but the sharp strife and the vengeance which it promised. Perhaps, indeed, this mood prevailed even after the supplication was ended. It mingled in with the feelings which followed it, and whenever they became excited, the revulsion ceased entirely, which a more deliberate thought of the subject necessarily occasioned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THINGS IN EMBRYO. Edward Morton kept his promise. Before the dawn of the following day he released his kinsman from his prison. He had previously sent his followers out of the way—all save the landlord, Muggs—who could scarcely be counted one of them—and some two or three more upon whom he thought he could rely. He was not without sufficient motive for this caution.—He had his apprehensions of that unruly and insubordinate spirit which they had already shown, and which, baffled of its expected victim, he reasonably believed might once more display itself in defiance. A strange idea of honour prompted him at all hazards to set free the person, the destruction of whom would have been to him a source of the greatest satisfaction. Contradictions of this sort are not uncommon among minds which have been subject to conflicting influences. It was not a principle, but pride, that moved him to this magnanimity. Even Edward Conway, boasting of his connexion with the most atrocious ruffians, would have felt a sense of shame to have acted otherwise. The noble animal which Clarence rode was restored to him at his departure. Morton, also mounted, accompanied him, in silence, for a mile beyond the secluded spot which the robbers had chosen for their temporary refuge. He then spoke at parting. “Colonel Conway, your path is free, and you are also! Before you lies the road to the Wateree, with which you are sufficiently acquainted. Here we separate. I have fulfilled my pledges. When next we meet I shall remind you of yours. Till then, farewell.” He did not wait for an answer, but striking his rowel fiercely into the flanks of his horse, he gallopped rapidly back to the place which he had left. The eye of Clarence followed him with an expression of stern defiance, not unmingled with sadness, while he replied: “I will not fail thee, be that meeting when it may. Sad as the necessity is, I will not shrink from it. I, too, have my wrongs to avenge, Edward Conway. I, too, acknowledge that instinct of hate from the beginning, which will make a labour of love of this work of vengeance. I have striven, but fruitlessly, for its suppression,—now let it have its way. The hand of fate is in it. We have never loved each other. We have both equally doubted, distrusted, disliked—and these instincts have strengthened with our strength, grown with our growth, and their fruits are here. Shall I, alone, regret them? Shall they revolt my feelings only? No! I have certainly no fear—I shall endeavour to free myself from all compunction! Let the strife come when it may, be sure I shall be the last to say, `hold off—are we not brethren?' You fling away the ties of blood, do you? Know from me, Edward Conway, that in flinging away these ties, you fling from you your only security. They have often protected you from my anger before—they shall protect you no longer.” And slowly, and solemnly, while the youth spoke, did he wave his open palm toward the path taken by his brother. But he wasted no more time in soliloquy. Prudence prompted him, without delay, to avail himself of the freedom which had been given him. He knew not what pursuers might be upon his path. He was not satisfied that his kinsman would still be true, without evasion, to the assurances which he had given in a mood of unwonted magnanimity. He plied his spurs freely, therefore, and his steed acknowledged the governing impulse. Another moment found him pressing toward the swamp. But he had scarcely commenced 12* his progress, when a well-known voice reached his ears, in a friendly summons to stop; while, on one hand, emerging from the forest came riding out his faithful friend and adherent, Jack Bannister. “Ah, true and trusty, Jack. Ever watchful. Ever mindful of your friend—worth a thousand friends—I might well have looked to see you as nigh to me in danger as possible. I owe you much, Jack—very much. It was you, then, as I thought, whose rifle—” “Worked that chap's buttonhole,” was the answer of the woodman, with a chuckle, as, shaking the long, ungainly, but unerring instrument, aloft, with one hand, he grasped with the other the extended hand of his superior. “I couldn't stand to see the fellow handle you roughly, no how. It made the gall bile up within me; and though I knowed that 'twould bring the whole pack out upon me, and was mighty dub'ous that it would make the matter worse for you; yet I couldn't work it out no other way. I thought you was gone for good and all, and that made me sort of desp'rate. I didn't pretty much know what I was a-doing, and 'tmought be that Polly Longlips (here he patted the rifle affectionately) went off herself, for I don't think I sighted her. If I had, Clarence, I don't think the drop would ha' been on the button of him that tumbled. I'm a thinking 'twould ha' drawn blood that was a mighty sight more nigh to your'n, if there was any good reason that your father had for giving Edward Conway the name he goes by. I suppose, Clarence, you're pretty nigh certain now that he's no ra'al, proper kin of your'n, for you to be keeping him out of harm's way, and getting into it yourself on account of him.” “And yet, he saved me from those ruffians, Jack.” “Dog's meat! Clarence, and what of that? Wa'nt it him that got you into their gripe; and wouldn't he been worse than any sarpent that ever carried p'ison at the root of his tongue, if he hadn't ha' saved you, after what you'd done for him jest afore? Don't talk to me of his saving you, Clarence—don't say any thing more in his favour, or I'll stuff my ears with moss and pine gum whenever you open your lips to speak. You've stood by him long enough, and done all that natur' called for, and more than was nateral. Half the men I know, if they had ever been saved by any brother, as you've been saved by him, would ha' sunk a tooth into his heart that wouldn't ha' worked its way out in one winter, no how. But you've done with him now, I reckon; and if you aint, I'm done with you. There'll be no use for us to travel together, if you aint ready to use your knife agen Edward Conway the same as agen any other tory.” “Be satisfied, Jack. I'm sworn to it—nay, pledged to him by oath—when we next meet to make our battle final. It was on this condition that he set me free.” “Well, he's not so mean a skunk after all, if he's ready to fight it out. I didn't think he was bold enough for that. But it's all the better. I only hope that when the time comes, I'll be the one to see fair play. I'll stand beside you, and if he flattens you,—which, God knows, I don't think its in one of his inches to do— why, he'll only have to flatten another. It's cl'ar to you now, Clarence, that you knows all about him.” “Yes! He is the leader of the Black Riders. He declared it with his own lips.” “When he could'nt help it no longer. Why, Clarence, he 'twas that sent them fellows a'ter you that tuk you. I didn't see it, but I knows it jest the same as if I did. But, though you know that he's a tory and a Black Rider, there's a thousand villanies he's been doing ever since we played together that you know nothing about; and I'm 'minded of one in preticular that happened when you was at college in England, by the coming of old Jacob Clarkson!—You 'member Jake Clarkson that planted a short mile from your father's place, don't you?—he had a small patch of farm, and did boating along the river, like myself.” “Yes, very well—I remember him.” “Well, him I mean. Old Jake had a daughter—I reckon you don't much remember her, Mary Clarkson —as spry and sweet a gal as ever man set eyes on. I had a liking for the gal—I own it, Clarence—and if so be things hadn't turned out as they did, well, I mought ha' married her. But it's a God's blessing I didn't; for you see Edward Conway got the better of her, and 'fore Jake know'd any thing about it, poor Mary was a-carrying a bundle she had no law to carry. When they pushed the gal about it, she confessed 'twas Edward Conway's doings; and she told a long gal's story how Edward had promised to marry her, and swore it on Holy Book, and all that sort of thing, which was pretty much out of reason and nature,—not for him to speak it, but for her to be such a child as to believe it. But no matter. The stir was mighty great about it. Old Jake carried a rifle more than three months for Edward Conway, and he took that time to make his first trip to Florida, where, I'm thinking, bad as he was before, he larn'd to be a great deal worse. It was there that he picked up all his tory notions from having too much dealing with John Stuart, the Indian agent, who, you know, is just as bad an inimy of our liberties as ever come out of the old country. Well, but the worst is yet to come. Poor Mary couldn't stand the desartion of Edward Conway and the discovery. Besides, old Jake was too rough for the poor child, who, you know, Clarence, was a'most to be pitied; for it's mighty few women in this world that can say no when they're axed for favours by a man they have a liking for. Old Jake was mighty cross; and Molly, his wife, who, by nature, was a she-tiger, she made her tongue wag night and day about the sad doing of the poor gal, 'till her heart was worn down in her bosom, and she didn't dare to look up, and trembled whenever any body came nigh to her, and got so wretched and scary at last, that she went off one night, nobody knows where, and left no tracks. Well, there was another stir. We were all turned out on the sarch, and it was my misfortune, Clarence, to be the first to find out what had become of her. Dickens! it makes my eyes water to this day!” “And where did you find her, Jack?” “Didn't find her, Clarence; but found out the miserable end she made of herself. We found her bonnet and shawl on the banks of the river, but the body we didn't find. The rocks at the bottom of the Congaree know all about it, I reckon.” “I have now a faint recollection of this story, Bannister. I must have heard it while in England, or soon after my return.” “'Twas a bad business, Clarence; and I didn't feel the smallest part of it. I didn't know till I come across the gal's bonnet how great a liking I had for her. I reckon I cried like a baby over it. From that day I mistrusted Edward Conway worse than p'ison. There was a-many things long before that, that made me suspicion him; but after that, Clarence, I always felt, when I was near him, as if I saw a great snake, a viper, or a mockasin, and looked all round for a chunk to mash its head with.” “And what of her old father, Jack?” “Why, he's come up to join your troop. I was so full of thinking 'bout other matters yesterday, when I saw you, that I quite forgot to tell you. He's been fighting below with Marion's men, but he wanted to look at the old range, and so he broke off to go under Sumter;—but the true story is, I'm thinking, that he's hearn how Edward Conway is up here somewhere, a-fighting, and he comes to empty that rifle at his head. He'll say his prayers over the bullet he uses at him, and I reckon will make a chop in it, so that he may know, when his inimy is tumbled, if the shot that does the business was the one that had a commission for it.” “And Clarkson is now with us? In the swamp?” “I left him at the `Big Crossings.' But, Clarence, don't you say nothing to him about this business. It's a sore truth for him still, though the matter is so long gone by. But every thing helps to keep it alive in his heart. His old woman's gone to her long home; and though she had a rough tongue and a long one, yet he was used to her; and when he lost little Mary, and then her, and the tories burnt his house, it sort-a cut him up, root and branch, and made him fretful and vexatious. But he'll fight, Clarence, like old Blazes— there's no mistake in him.” “I will be careful, Jack; but a truce to this. We have but little time for old histories, and such melancholy ones as these may well be forgotten. We have enough before us, sufficiently sad to demand all our attention and awaken our griefs. To business now, Jack. We have idled long enough.” “Ready, Colonel. Say the word.” “Take the back track, and see after these Black Riders. We are fairly pledged now to encounter them —to beat them—to make the cross in blood on the breast of the very best of them.” “Edward Conway at the head of them!” “Edward Conway no longer, John Bannister. He himself disclaims the name with scorn. Let him have the name, with the doom which is due to the chief of the banditti which he leads. That name has saved him too long already. I rejoice that he now disclaims it, with all its securities. After him, John Bannister. If you have skill as a scout, use it now. After what has passed between us, he will be on my heels very shortly. He may be even now, with all his band. I must be prepared for him, and must distrust him. It is therefore of vast importance that all his movements should be known. To your discretion I leave it. Away. Find me in the swamp to-morrow at the Little Crossings. We must leave it for the Congaree in three days more. Away. Let your horse find his heels.” A brief grasp of the hand, and a kind word, terminated the interview between the youthful partisan and his trusty follower. The latter dashed abruptly into the woods bordering the swamp, while the former, taking an upper route, pursued the windings of the river, till he reached the point he aimed at. We will not follow the course of either for the present, but return to the house of Muggs and the proceedings of the outlawed captain. There, every thing had the appearance of a rapid movement. The troopers, covered by a thick wood, were preparing to ride. Horses, ready caparisoned, were fastened beneath the trees, while their riders, singly or in groups, were seeking in various ways to while away the brief interval of time accorded them in the delay of their chief officer. He, meanwhile, in the wigwam of Muggs, seemed oppressed by deliberations which baffled for the time his habitual activity. He sat upon the same bulk which he had occupied while a prisoner the night before, and seemed willing to surrender himself to that fit of abstraction which the landlord, though he watched it with manifest uneasiness, did not seem bold enough to interrupt. At length the door of the apartment opened, and the presence of a third person put an end to the meditations of the one and the forbearance of the other party. The intruder was a youth, apparently not more than seventeen years of age. Such would have been the impression on any mind, occasioned by his timid bearing and slender figure; indeed, he would have been called undersized for seventeen. But there was that in his pale, well defined features, which spoke for a greater maturity of thought, if not of time, than belongs to that early period in life. The lines of his cheeks and mouth were full of intelligence—that intelligence which results from early anxieties and the pressure of serious necessities. The frank, free, heedless indifference of the future, which shines out in the countenance of boyhood, seemed utterly obliterated from his face. The brow was already touched with wrinkles, and seemed strangely at variance with the short, closely cropped black hair, the ends of which were apparent beneath the slouched cap of fur he wore. The features pensive, rather pretty, but awfully pale. Though they expressed great intelligence and the presence of an active thought, yet this did not seem to have produced its usual result in conferring confidence. The look of the youth was downcast, and when his large dark eyes ventured to meet those of the speaker, they seemed to cower and to shrink within themselves; and this desire appeared to give them an unsteady, dancing motion, which became painful to the beholder, as it seemed to indicate apprehension, if not fright, in the proprietor. His voice faltered too when he spoke, and was only made intelligible by his evident effort at deliberateness. Like that of the rest of the troop, the costume of the youth was black. A belt of black leather encircled his waist, in which pistols and a knife were ostentatiously stuck. Yet how should one so timid be expected to use them. Trembling in the presence of a friend, what firmness could he possess in the encounter with a foe? Where was the nerve, the strength, for the deadly issues of battle? It seemed, indeed, a mockery of fate, to send forth so feeble a frame and so fearful a spirit, while the thunder and the threatening storm were in the sky. But no such scruples seemed to afflict the chief; nor did he seem to recognize the timidity of the boy's approach. Perhaps he ascribed it to the natural effect of his own stern manner, which was rather increased than softened as he listened to the assurance which the boy made that all was ready for a movement. “You have lingered, sir.” “Barton and the ensign were not with the rest, sir, and I had to look for them!” “So!—plotting again, were they? But they shall find their match yet! Fools! Blind and deaf fools, that will not content themselves with being knaves to their own profit, and press on till they become knaves to their utter ruin. But go, boy—see that your own horse is ready; and hark ye, do not be following too closely at my heels. I have told you repeatedly, keep the rear when we are advancing, the front only when we are retreating. Remember.” The boy bowed humbly and left the room. “And now, Muggs, you are bursting to speak. I know why, wherefore, and on what subject. Now, do you know that I have but to reveal to the troop the suggestion you made to me last night, to have them tear you and your house to pieces. Do you forget that desertion is death, according to your own pledges?” “I am no longer one of the troop,” replied the landlord hastily. “Ay, that may be in one sense, but is scarcely so in any other. You are only so far released from your oath that no one expects you to do active duty. But, let them hear you speak, even of yourself, as last night you spoke to me of my policy, and they will soon convince you that they hold you as fairly bound to them now as you were when all your limbs were perfect. They will only release you by tearing what remains asunder.” “Well, but cappin, suppose they would, as you say. There's no reason why they should know the advice I give to you; and there's no reason why you shouldn't take that advice. We're besot, as I said before, with dangers. There's Greene with his army, a-gaining ground every day. There's Sumter, and Marion, and Pickens, and Mayhew, and—” `Psha! Muggs, what a d—d catalogue is this; and what matters it all. Be it as you say, do I not know? Did I not know at the beginning, of all these dangers. They do not terrify me now any more than then! These armies that you speak of are mere skeletons.” “They give mighty sound knocks for skeletons. There's that affair at Hobkirk's—” “Well, did not Rawdon keep the field?” “Not over long, captain, and now—” “Look you, Muggs, one word for all. I am sworn to the troop. I will keep my oath. They shall find no faltering in me. Living or dead, I stand by them to the last; and I give you these few words of counsel, if you would be safe. I will keep secret what you have said to me, for I believe, you meant all kindly; but let me hear no more of the same sort of counsel. Another word to the same effect, and I deliver you over to the tender mercies of those with whom the shortest prayer is a span too long for an offender whose rope is ready and whose tree is near.” These words were ended as the boy reappeared at the door and informed the chief that the troop was in motion. The latter rose and prepared to follow. He shook hands with the landlord at parting, contenting himself with saying the single word, “remember!”—in a tone of sufficient warning—in reply to the other's farewell. In VOL. I. 13 this, Edward Morton displayed another sample of the practised hypocrisy of his character. His first mental soliloquy after leaving the landlord, was framed in such language as the following:— “I like your counsel, Master Muggs, but shall be no such fool as to put myself in your power by showing you that I like it. I were indeed a sodden ass, just at this moment, when half of my troop suspect me of treachery, to suffer you to hear from my own lips that I actually looked with favour upon your counsel. Yet the old fool reasons rightly. This is no region for me now. It will not be much longer. The British power is passing away rapidly. Rawdon will not sustain himself much longer. Cornwallis felt that, and hence his pretended invasion of Virginia. Invasion, indeed!—a cover only to conceal his own flight. But what care I for him or them? My own fame is of sufficient importance, and that is well nigh up. I deceived myself when I fancied that the rebels could not sustain themselves through the campaign, and if I wait to see the hunt up, I shall have a plentiful harvest from my own folly. No! no! I must get out of the scrape as well as I can, and with all possible speed. But no landlords for confidants. A wise man needs none of any kind. They are for your weak, dependent, adhesive people; folks who believe in friendships and loves, and that sort of thing. Loves!—Have I then none—no love!—Ay, there are a thousand in that one. If I can win her, whether by fair word or fearless deed, well!—It will not then be hard to break from these scoundrels. But here they are!” Such was the train of Edward Morton's thoughts as he left the landlord. Followed by the boy of whom we have already spoken, he cantered forth to the wood where the troop had formed, aud surveyed them with a keen, searching, soldierly eye. Morton was not without military ambition, and certainly possessed, like his brother, a considerable share of military talent. His glance expressed pleasure at the trim, excellent dress and aspect of his troop. Beyond this, and those common purposes of selfishness which had prompted the evil deeds as well of men as leader, he had no sympathies with them. Even as he looked and smiled upon their array, the thought rapidly passed through his mind— “Could I run their heads into the swamp now, and withdraw my own, it were no bad finish to a doubtful game. It must be tried; but I must use them something farther. They can do good service yet, and no man should throw away his tools till his work is ended.” Brief time was given to the examination. Then followed the instructions to his subordinates, which were uttered in private, and to each singly. Morton made his arrangements with some reference to the rumours of disaffection among his men which had reached his ears. He took care to separate the suspected officers, in such a way as to deprive them, for the present, of all chance of communion;—then, taking the advance, he led them forward, and was soon found pursuing the track lately taken by Clarence Conway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. NEW PRINICIPLES DISCUSSED BY OLD LAWS. The last words of the Chief of the Black Riders, as he left the presence of the landlord, had put that worthy into a most unenviable frame of mind. He had counselled Morton for his own benefit—he himself had no selfish considerations. He flattered himself that the relation in which he stood to the parties between which the country was divided, not to speak of his mutilated condition, would secure him from danger, no matter which of them should finally obtain the ascendency. That he should be still held responsible to his late comrades, though he no longer engaged in their pursuits and no longer shared their spoils, was a medium equally new and disquieting in which he was required to regard the subject. The stern threat with which Morton concluded left him in little doubt of the uncertain tenure of that security which he calculated to find among his old friends; and, at the same time, awakened in his heart new feelings in reference to the speaker. Hitherto, from old affinities, and because of some one of those nameless moral attachments which incline us favourably to individuals to whom we otherwise owe nothing, he had been as well disposed towards Edward Morton as he could have been towards any individual not absolutely bound to him by blood or interest. He had seen enough to like in him, to make him solicitous of his successes, and to lead him, in repeated instances, as in that which incurred the late rebuke, to volunteer his suggestions, and to take some pains in acquiring information which sometimes proved of essential benefit to the outlaw. It was partly in consequence of this interest that he acquired that knowledge of the private concerns of Morton, which prompted the latter, naturally enough, to confer with him, with tolerable freedom, on a number of topics, strictly personal to himself, and of which the troop knew nothing. Conscious of no other motive than the good of the outlaw, and not dreaming of that profounder cunning of the latter, which could resolve him to adopt the counsel which he yet seemed to spurn with loathing, the landlord, reasonably enough, felt indignant at the language with which he had been addressed; and his indignation was not lessened by the disquieting doubts of his own safety which the threats of Morton had suggested. It was just at the moment when his conclusions were most unfavourable to the outlaw, that the door of his wigwam was quietly thrown open, and he beheld, with some surprise, the unexpected face of our worthy scout, Jack Bannister, peering in upon him. The latter needed no invitation to enter. “Well, Isaac Muggs,” said he, as he closed and bolted the door behind him—“you're without your company at last. I was a'most afear'd, for your sake in pretic'lar, that them bloody sculpers was a-going to take up lodging with you for good and all. I waited a pretty smart chance to see you cl'ar of them, and I only wish I was sartin, Muggs, that you was as glad as myself when they concluded to make a start of it.” “Ahem!—To be sure I was, friend Supple,” replied the other with an extra show of satisfaction in his countenance which did not altogether conceal the evident hesitation of his first utterance.—“To be sure, I was: they'd ha' drunk me out of house and home if they had stopped much longer. A peck of lemons, a'most—more than two papers of sugar, best Havana, and there's no measuring the Jamaica, wasted upon them long swallows. I a'nt glad of their going, Jack, I have a most onnateral way of thinking on such matters.” The keen eyes of Supple Jack never once turned from the countenance of the landlord, as he detailed the consumption of his guests; and when the latter had finished, he coolly replied:— 13* “I'm afear'd, Isaac Muggs, you aint showing clean hands under the table. That's a sort of talking that don't stop my eyes, if it stops my ears. Don't I know it would be mighty onnateral if you wa'n't glad enough to sell your pecks of lemons and your papers of sugar, and your gallons of rum, pretic'larly when in place of them you can count me twenty times their valley in British gould? No, Muggs, that sort o' talking won't do for me. Take the cross out of your tongue and be pretic'lar in what you say, for I'm going to s'arch you mighty close this time, I tell you.” “Well but, Supple, you wouldn't have me take nothing from them that drinks my substance.” “Who talks any such foolishness but yourself, Muggs? —I don't. I'm for your taking all you can get out of the inimy—for it's two ways of distressing them to sell 'em strong drink and take their gould for it. The man that drinks punch is always the worse for it; and it don't better his business to make him pay for it in guineas. That's not my meaning, Muggs. I'm on another track, and I'll show you both eends of it before I'm done.” “Why, Supple, you talks and looks at me suspiciously,” said the landlord, unable to withstand the keen inquiring glances of the scout, and was as little able to conceal his apprehensions lest some serious discovery had been made to his detriment. “Look you, Isaac Muggs, do you see that peep-hole there in the wall—oh, there—jest one side of the window—the peep-hole in the logs.” “Yes, I see it,” said the landlord, whose busy fingers were already engaged in thrusting a wadding of dry moss into the discovered aperture. “Well, it's too late to poke at it now, Muggs,” said the other. “The harm's done already, and I'll let you know the worst of it. Through that peep-hole last night I saw what was a going on here among you—and through that peep-hole, it was this same Polly Longlips”— tapping his rifle as he spoke—“that went off of her own liking, and tumbled one big fellow; and was mighty vexatious now when she found herself onable to tumble another.” “Yes, yes—Polly Longlips was always a famous shot;” murmured the landlord flatteringly, and moving to take, in his remaining hand, the object of his eulogium. But Supple Jack evidently recoiled at so doubtful a liberty in such dangerous times, and drew the instrument more completely within the control of his own arm. “She's a good critter, Muggs, but is sort o' bashful among strangers; and when she puts up her mouth, it isn't to be kissed or kiss, I tell you. She's not like other gals in that pretic'lar. Now, don't think I mistrust you, Muggs, for 'twould be mighty timorsome was I to be afeard of any thing you could do with a rifle like her, having but one arm to go upon. It's only a jealous way I have, that makes me like to keep my Polly out of the arms of any other man. It's nateral enough, you know, to a person that loves his gal.” “Oh, yes, very natural, Supple; but somehow, it seems to me as if you did suspicion me, Supple—it does, I declar'.” “To be sure I do,” replied the other promptly. “I suspicions you've been making a little bit of a fool of yourself; and I've come to show you which eend of the road will bring you up. You know, Muggs, that I know all about you—from A to izzard. I can read you like a book. I reckon you'll allow that I have larn'd that lesson, if I never larn'd any other.” “Well, Supple, I reckon I may say you know me pretty much as well as any other person.” “Better, better, Muggs!—I know you from the jump, and I know what more of our boys know, that you did once ride with these Black—” “Yes, Supple, but—” and the landlord jumped up and looked out of the door, and peered, with all his eyes, as far as possible into the surrounding wood. The scout, meanwhile, with imperturbable composure, retained the seat which he had originally taken. “Don't you be scarey,” said he, when the other had returned, “I've sarcumvented your whole establishment, —looked in at both of your blocks, and all of your cypress hollows, not to speak of a small ride I took after your friends—” “No friends of mine, Supple, no more than any other people that pay for what they git,” exclaimed the apprehensive landlord. “That's the very p'int I'm driving at, Muggs. You know well enough that if our boys had a guess that you ever rode with that 'ere troop, it wouldn't be your stump of an arm that 'd save you from the swinging limb.” “But I never did hide that I fout on the British side, Supple!” said the other. “In the West Indies, Isaac Muggs. That's the story you told about your hurts, and all that. If you was to tell them, or if I was to tell them, any other now, that had the least smell of the truth in it, your shop would be shut up for ever in this life, and—who knows?—maybe never opened in the next. Well, now, I'm come here this blessed day to convart you to rebellion. Through that very peep-hole, last night, I heard you with my own ears talking jest as free as the rankest tory in all the Wateree country.” “Oh, Lord, Supple, wa'nt that natural enough, when the house were full of tories?” “'Twa'nt nateral to an honest man at any time,” replied the other indignantly; “and let me tell you, Muggs, the house wa'nt full—only Ned Conway was here, with his slippery tongue that's a wheedling you, like a blasted blind booby, Muggs, to your own destruction. That same fellow will put your neck in the noose yet, and laugh when you're going up.” A prediction so confidently spoken, and which tallied so admirably with the savage threat uttered by the outlaw at his late departure, drove the blood from the cheeks of the landlord, and made him heedless of the harsh language in which the scout had expressed himself. His apology was thus expressed: “But 'twas pretty much the same thing, Supple—he was their captain, you know.” “Captain! And what does he care about them, and what do they care about him, if they can get their eends sarved without each other? It wouldn't be a toss of a copper, the love that's atween them. He'll let them hang, and they'll hang him, as soon as it's worth while for either to do so. Don't I know, Muggs? Don't I know that they're conniving strong agin him even now, and don't I calculate that as soon as the Congaree country gits too hot to hold Rawdon, this Ned Conway will be the first to kill a colt to 'scape a halter. He'll ride a horse to death to get to Charlestown, and when there, he'll sink a ship to git to the West Indies. He knows his game, and he'll so work it, Isaac Muggs, as to leave your neck in the collar without waiting to hear the crack.” “You're clean mistaken, Supple, for 'twas only this morning that I cautioned the captain 'bout his men, and I gin him my counsel to take the back track and find his way to the seaboard; but he swore he'd never desart the troop, and he spoke mighty cross to me about it, and even threatened, if I talked of it another time to him, to set the troopers on me.” “More knave he, and more fool you for your pains,” said the other irreverently; “but this only makes me the more sartin that he means to finish a bad game by throwing up his hand. He's made his Jack, and he don't stop to count,—but look you, Isaac Muggs, all this tells agin you. Here you're so thick, hand and glove, with the chief of the Black Riders, that you're advising him what to do; and by your own words, he makes out that you're still liable to the laws of the troop. Eh?” “But that's only what he said, Supple, and its what was a-worrying me when you come in.” “Look you, Muggs, it ought to worry you! I'm mighty serious in this business. I'm going to be mighty strick with you. I was the one that spoke for you among our boys, and 'twas only because I showed them that I had sort o' convarted you from your evil ways, that they agreed to let you stay here in quiet on the Wateree. Well, I thought I had convarted you. You remember that long summer day last August, when Polly Longlips gin a bowel-complaint to Macleod, the Scotch officer. You was with him in the boat, and helped to put him across the Wateree. Well, when we was a-burying him—for he died like a gentleman bred—I had a gift to ax you sartin questions, and we had a long argyment about our liberties, and George the Third, and what business Parlyment had to block up Boston port, and put stamps on our tea before they let us drink it. Do you remember all them matters and specifications, Isaac Muggs?” “Well, Supple, I can't but say I do. We did have quite a long argyment when the lieutenant was a dying, and jest after the burial.” “No, 'twas all the while we was a-laying in the trench, for I recollect saying to you when you was a pitying him all the time, that I was sorry for the poor man's death, I wasn't sorry that I killed him, and I would shoot the very next one that come along, jest the same, for it made the gall bile up in me to see a man that I had never said a hard word to in all my life, come here, over the water, a matter, maybe, of a thousand miles, to force me, at the p'int of the bagnet, to drink stamped tea. I never did drink the tea, no how. For my own drinking, I wouldn't give one cup of coffee, well biled, for all the tea that was ever growed or planted. But, 'twas the freedom of the thing that I was argying for, and 'twas on the same argyment that I was willing to fight. Now, that was the time, and them was the specifications which made us argyfy, and it was only then, when I thought I had convarted you from your evil ways, that I tuk on me to answer for your good conduct to our boys. I spoke to the colonel for you, jest the same as if I had know'd you for a hundred years. It's true I did know you, and the mother that bore you, and a mighty good sort of woman she was; but it was only after that argyment that I felt a call to speak in your behalf. Now, Isaac Muggs, I aint conscience-free about that business. I've had my suspicions a long time that I spoke a little too much in your favour, and what I heard last night—and what I seed—makes me fearful that you've been a sort o' snake in the grass. I doubt your convarsion, Isaac Muggs; but before I tell you my mind about the business, I'd jest like to hear from your own lips what you think about our argyment, and what you remember, and what you believe.” The landlord looked utterly bewildered. It was evident that he had never devoted much time to metaphysics, and the confusion and disorder of the few words which he employed in answer, and the utter consternation of his looks, amply assured the inflexible scout that the labour of conversion must be entirely gone over again. “I see, Isaac Muggs, that you're in a mighty bad fix, and it's a question with me whether I ought raly to give you a helping hand to git out of it. If I thought you wanted to git at the truth—” “Well, Supple, as God's my judge, I sartinly do.” “I'd go over the argyment agin for your sake, but—” “I'd thank you mightily, Supple.” “But 'twon't do to go on forgetting, Muggs. The thing is to be understood, and if it's once understood, it's to be believed; and when you say you believe, there's no dodging after that. There's no saying you're a tory with tories, and a whig with whigs, jest as it seems needful. The time's come for every tub to stand on its own bottom, and them that don't must have a tumble. Now, there's no axing you to fight for us, Muggs—that's out of natur', and I'm thinking we have more men now than we can feed; but we want the truth in your soul, and we want you to stick to it. If you're ready for that, and really willing, I'll put it to you in plain argyments that you can't miss, onless you want to miss 'em; and you'll never dodge from 'em, if you have only half a good-sized man's soul in you to go upon. You've only to say now, whether you'd like to know—” The landlord cut short the speaker by declaring his anxiety to be re-enlightened, and Supple Jack rose to his task with all the calm deliberation of a practised lecturer. Coiling up a huge quid of tobacco in one jaw, to prevent its interfering with the argument, he went to the door. “I'll jest go out for a bit and hitch `Mossfoot,”'—the name conferred upon his pony, as every good hunter has a tender diminutive for the horse he rides and the gun he shoots—“I'll only go and hitch `Mossfoot' deeper in the swamp, and out of harm's way for a spell, and then be back. It's a three minutes' business only.” He was not long gone, but during that time rapid transitions of thought and purpose were passing through the mind of the veteran landlord. Circumstances had already prepared him to recognize the force of many of the scout's arguments. The very counsel he had given to Edward Morton originated in a conviction that the British cause was going down—that the whigs were gaining ground upon the tories with every day's movement, and that it would be impossible for the latter much longer to maintain themselves. The policy of the publican usually goes with that of the rising party. He is not generally a bad political thermometer, and Muggs was a really good one. Besides, he had been stung by the contemptuous rejection of his counsel by the chief whom he was conscious of having served unselfishly, and alarmed by the threats which had followed his uncalled-for counsel. The necessity of confirming his friends among the successful rebels grew singularly obvious to his intellect, if it had not been so before, in the brief absence of the scout; and when he returned, the rapidly quickening intelligence of the worthy landlord made the eyes of the former brighten with the satisfaction which a teacher must naturally feel at the wonderful progress and ready recognition of his doctrines. These it will not be necessary for us entirely, or even in part, to follow. The worthy woodman has already given us a sufficient sample of the sort of philosophy in which he dealt; and farther argument on the tyranny of forcing “stamped tea” down the people's throats, “will they, will they,” may surely be dispensed with. But, flattering as his success appeared to be at first, Supple Jack was soon annoyed by some doubts and difficulties which his convert suggested in the progress of the argument. Like too many of his neighbours, Isaac Muggs was largely endowed with the combative quality of self-esteem. This, as the discussion advanced, was goaded into exercise; and his fears and his policy were equally forgotten in the desire of present triumph. A specimen of the manner in which their deliberations warmed into controversy may be passingly afforded. “It's agin natur' and reason, and a man's own seven senses,” said Supple Jack, “to reckon on any man's right to make laws for another, when he don't live in the same country with him. I say, King George, living in England, never had a right to make John Bannister, living on the Congaree, pay him taxes for tea or any thing.” “But it's all the same country, England and America, Jack Bannister.” “Jimini!—if that's the how, what makes you give 'em different names, I want to know?” “Oh, that was only because it happened so,” said the landlord, doubtfully. “Well, it so happens that I won't pay George the Third any more taxes. That's the word for all; and it's good reason why I shouldn't pay him, when, for all his trying, he can't make me. Here he's sent his regiments—regiment after regiment—and the Queen sent her regiment, and the Prince of Wales his regiment—I reckon we didn't tear the Prince's regiment all to flinders at Hanging Rock!—Well, then, there was the Royal Scotch and the Royal Irish, and the Dutch Hessians; I suppose they didn't call them royal, 'cause they couldn't ax in English for what they wanted:—well, what was the good of it?—all these regiments together couldn't make poor Jack Bannister, a Congaree boatmen, drink stamped tea or pay taxes. The regiments, all I've named and a hundred more, are gone like last autumn's dry leaves; and the only fighting that's a-going on now, worth to speak of, is American born `gainst American born. Wateree facing Wateree—Congaree facing Congaree—Santee facing Santee—and cutting each other's throats to fill the pockets of one of the ugliest old men— for a white man—that ever I looked on. It spiles the VOL. I. 14 face of a guinea where they put his face. Look you, Isaac Muggs, I would ha' gathered you, as Holy Book has it, even as a hen gathers up her chickens. I'd ha' taken you 'twixt my legs in time of danger, and seed you safe through—but you wouldn't! I've tried to drive reason into your head, but it's no use; you can't see what's right, and where to look for it. You answer every thing I say with your eyes sot, and a cross-buttock. Now, what's to be done? I'm waiting on you to answer.” “Swounds, Supple, but you're grown a mighty hasty man o' late,” replied the landlord, beginning to be sensible of the imprudence of indulging his vanity at a moment so perilous to his fortunes. “I'm sure I've tried my best to see the right and the reason. I've hearn what you had to say—” “Only to git some d—d crooked answer ready, that had jist as much to do with the matter as my great grand-daughter has. You hearn me, but it wa'n't to see if the truth was in me; it was only to see if you couldn't say something after me that would swallow up my saying. I don't see how you're ever to get wisdom, with such an onderstanding, unless it's licked into you by main force of tooth and timber.” “I could ha' fou't you once, John Bannister, though you are named Supple Jack,” replied the landlord with an air of indignant reproach, which, in his own self-absorption, escaped the notice of the scout. “It's no bad notion that,” he continued, without heeding the language of the landlord. “Many's the time, boy and man, I have fou't with a fellow when we couldn't find out the right of it, any way; and, as sure as a gun, if I wan't right I was sartain to be licked. Besides, Isaac Muggs, it usen to be an old law, when they couldn't get at the truth any other way, to make a battle, and cry on God's mercy to help the cause that was right. By Jimini, I don't see no other way for us. I've given you all the reason I know on this subject—all that I can onderstand, I mean—for to confess a truth, there's a-many reasons for our liberties that I hear spoken, and I not able to make out the sense of one of them. But all that I know I've told you, and there's more than enough to make me sartin of the side I take. Now, as you aint satisfied with any of my reasons, I don't see how we're to finish the business unless we go back to the old-time law, and strip to the buff for a fight. You used to brag of yourself, and you know what I am, so there's no use to ax about size and weight. If you speak agreeable to your conscience, and want nothing better than the truth, then, I don't see but a regular fight will give it to us; for, as I told you afore, I never yet did fight on the wrong side, that I didn't come up undermost.” The scout, in the earnestness with which he entertained and expressed his own views and wishes, did not suffer himself to perceive some of the obstacles which lay in the way of a transaction such as he so deliberately and seriously proposed. He was equally inaccessible to the several attempts of his companion to lessen his regards for a project to which the deficiency of a limb on the part of one of the disputants seemed to suggest a most conclusive objection. When, at length, he came to a pause, the landlord repeated his former reproachful reminiscence of a period when the challenge of the scout would not have gone unanswered by defiance. “But now!” and he lifted the stump of his remaining arm, in melancholy answer. “It's well for you to talk big, John Bannister; I know you're a strong man, and a spry. You wa'n't called Supple Jack for nothing. But there was a time when Isaac Muggs wouldn't ha' stopped to measure inches with you in a fair up and down, hip and hip, hug together. I could ha' thrown you once, I'm certain. But what's the chance now with my one arm, in a hug with a man that's got two. It's true, and I believe it, that God gives strength in a good cause; but it's quite onreasonable for me to hope for any help, seeing as how I can't help myself, no how. I couldn't even come to the grip, however much I wanted to.” “Sure enough, Muggs, and I didn't think of that, at all. It was so natural to think that a man that let his tongue wag so free as your'n had two arms at least to back it. I'm mighty sorry, Muggs, that you aint, for it's a great disapp'intment.” This was spoken with all the chagrin of a man who was discomfited in his very last hope of triumph. “Well, you see I aint,” said the other sulkily—“so there's no more to be said about it.” “Yes; but you aint come to a right mind yet. It's cl'ar to me, Isaac Muggs, that one thing or t'other must be done. You must cut loose from the Black Riders, or cut loose from us. You knows the risk of the one, and I can pretty much tell you what's the risk of the other. Now, there's a notion hits me, and it's one that comes nateral enough to a man that's fou't, in his time, in a hundred different ways. One of them ways, when I had to deal with a fellow that was so cl'ar behind me in strength that he couldn't match me as we stood, was to tie a hand behind my back, or a leg to a pine sapling, and make myself, as it were, a lame man till the fight was over. Now, look you, Muggs, if it's the truth your really after, I don't care much if I try that old-fashion way with you. I'm willing to buckle my right arm to my back.” “Swounds, Supple, how you talk. Come, take a drink.” “I'll drink when the time comes, Isaac Muggs, and when it's needful, but just now, when it's the truth I'm after, I don't suffer no diversions. I stick as close to it, I tell you, as I does to my inimy;—I don't stop to drink or rest, 'till it's a-lying fair before me. Now, it's needful for your sake, Muggs, that you come to a right sense of the reason in this business. It's needful that you give up Black Riders, Tories, British, Ned Conway, ugly faces, and the old sarpent. My conscience is mightily troubled because I stood for you, and it's needful that you come to a right understanding afore I leave you. I've sworn it, Isaac Muggs, by Polly Longlips, as we rode along together, and Mossfoot pricked up his ears as if he onderstood it all, and was a witness for us both. Now, you know what an oath by Polly Longlips means, Isaac. It means death to the inimy—sartin death, at any reasonable distance. I don't want your life, man;—by the Hokey, I don't, and that's why I want to put the reason in you, so that you might say to me at once, that you're done with these black varmints—for ever. They can do you no good—they can't help you much longer; and the time's a-coming, Isaac Muggs, when the Whigs will sweep this country, along the Wateree, and the Congaree, and Santee, with a broom of fire, and wo to the skunk, when that time comes, that can't get clear of the brush— wo to the 'coon that's caught sticking in his hollow. There's no reason you shouldn't onderstand the liberty-cause, and there's every reason why you should. But as you can't onderstand my argyment—” “Well, but Supple, you're always in such a hurry!—” “No hurry—never hurried a man in argyment in all my life; but when he's so tarnal slow to onderstand—” “That's it, Supple, I'm a slow man;—but I begin to see the sense of what you say.” “Well, that's something like, Muggs, but a good gripe about the ribs, a small tug upon the hips, partic'larly if we ax the blessing of Providence upon the argyment, will be about as good a way as any to help your onderstanding to a quicker motion. It'll put your slow pace into a smart canter.” “Psha, Supple, you're not serious in thinking that there's any thing in that?” “Aint I then! By Gum, you don't know me, Isaac Muggs, if you think as you say. Now, what's to hinder the truth from coming out in a fair tug between us. Here we stand, both tall men, most like in height and breadth, nigh alike in strength by most people's count; about the same age and pretty much the same experience. We've had our tugs and tears, both of us, in every way; though, to be sure, you got the worst of it, so far as we count the arm;—but as I tie up mine, there's no difference. Now I say, here we stand on the banks of the Wateree. Nobody sees us but the great God of all, that sees every thing in natur'. He's here, the 14* Bible says—he's here, and there, and every where, and he sees every thing every where. You believe all that, don't you, Isaac Muggs, for if you don't believe that, why, there's no use in talking at all. There's an eend of the question.” The landlord, though looking no little mystified, muttered assent, and this strange teacher of a new, or rather, reviver of an old faith, proceeded with accustomed volubility. “Well, then, here, as we are, we call upon God, and tell him how we stand. Though, to be sure, as he knows all, the telling wouldn't be such a needcessity. But, never mind—we tell him. I say to him, here's Isaac Muggs—it aint easy for him to understand this argyment, and unless he onderstands, it's a matter of life and death to him—you recollect, Muggs, about the oath I tuk on Polly Longlips.—He wants to l'arn and its needful to make a sign which 'll come home to his onderstanding more cl'arly than argyment by man's word of mouth. Now then we pray—and you must kneel to it beforehand, Muggs—I'll go aside under one tree and do you take another; and we'll make a hearty prayer after the proper sign. If the Lord says I'm right, why you'll know it mighty soon by the sprawl I'll give you;—but if I'm wrong, the tumble will be the other way, and I'll make the confession, though it 'll be a mighty bitter needcessity, I tell you. But I aint afeard. I'm sartin that my argyment for our rights is a true argyment, and I'll say my prayers with that sort of sartinty, that it would do your heart good if you could only feel about the same time.” “If I thought you was serious, Jack Bannister, but I'm dub'ous about it.” “Don't be dub'ous. I'm ser'ous as a sarpent. I b'lieve in God—I b'lieve he'll justify the truth, whenever we axes him, in airnest, for it! My old mother, God rest her bones, and bless her sperrit!—she's told me of more than twenty people, that's tried a wrestle for the truth. There was one man in partic'lar that she knows in Georgia. His name was Bostick;—he used to be a drummer in General Oglethorpe's Highland regiment. Well, another man, a sodger in the same regiment, made an accusation agin Bostick for stealing a watch-coat, and the sarcumstances went mighty strong agin Bostick. But he stood it out, and though he never shot a rifle in his life before, he staked the truth and his honesty on a shot; and, by the Hokey, though, as I tell you he never lifted rifle to his sight before, he put the bullet clean through the mouth and jaw of the sodger and cut off a small slice of his tongue, which was, perhaps, as good a judgment agin a man for false swearing as a rifle-shot could make. Well, 'twa'n't a month after that when they found it was an Ingin that had stole the cost, and so Bostick was shown to be an honest man, by God's blessing, in every way.” There was something so conclusive on the subject, in this, and one or two similar anecdotes, which Supple Jack told, and which, having heard them from true believers in his youth, had led to his own adoption of the experiment, that the landlord, Muggs, offered no further doubts or objections. The earnestness of his companion became contagious, and, with far less enthusiasm of character, he was probably not unwilling—in order to the proper adoption of a feeling which was growing momently in favour in his eyes—to resort to the wager of battle as an easy mode of making a more formal declaration in behalf of the dominant faction of the state. The novelty of the suggestion had its recommendation also; and but few more words were wasted, before the two went forth to a pleasant and shady grass-plat, which lay some two hundred yards farther in the hollow of the wood, in order that the test so solemnly recommended on such high authority, should be fairly made in the presence of that High Judge only, whose arbitrament, without intending any irreverence, was so earnestly invoked by the simple woodman of Congaree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE TRIAL FOR THE TRUTH. No change could have been suddenly greater than that which was produced upon the countenance and conduct of John Bannister when he found himself successful in bringing the landlord to the desired issue. His seriousness was all discarded,—his intense earnestness of air and tone,— and a manner, even playful and sportive, succeeded to that which had been so stern and sombre. He congratulated Muggs and himself, equally, on the strong probability, so near at hand, of arriving at the truth by a process so direct, and proceeded to make his arrangements for the conflict with all the buoyancy of a boy traversing the playground with `leap-frog' and `hop o' my thumb.' The landlord did not betray the same degree of eagerness, but he was not backward. He might have had his doubts of the issue, for Supple Jack had a fame in those days which spread far and wide along the three contiguous rivers. Wherever a pole-boat had made its way, there had the name of Jack Bannister found repeated echoes. But Muggs was a fearless man, and he had, besides, a very tolerable degree of self-assurance, which led him to form his own expectations and hopes of success. If he had any scruples at all, they arose rather from his doubt whether the proposed test of truth would be a fair one— a doubt which seemed very fairly overcome in his mind, as, indeed, it should be in that of the reader, if full justice is done to the final argument which the scout addressed to his adversary on this subject. “There never was a quarrel and a fight yet that didn't come out of a wish to l'arn or to teach the truth. What's King George a-fighting us for this very moment? Why, to make us b'lieve in him. If he licks us, why we'll b'lieve in him; and if we licks him, 'gad, I'm thinking he'll have to b'lieve in us. Aint that cl'ar, Muggs? So, let's fall to—if I licks you, I reckon you'll know where to look for the truth for ever after; for I'll measure your back on it, and your breast under it, and you'll feel it in all your sides.” The ground was chosen—a pleasant area beneath a shadowing grove of oaks, covered with a soft greensward, which seemed to lessen, in the minds of the combatants, the dangers of discomfiture. But when the parties began to strip for the conflict, a little difficulty suggested itself which had not before disturbed the thoughts of either. How was the superfluous arm of Supple Jack to be tied up. Muggs could evidently perform no such friendly office; but a brief pause given to their operations enabled the scout to arrange it easily. A running noose was made in the rope, into which he thrust the unnecessary member, then gave the end of the line to his opponent, who contrived to draw it around his body, and bind the arm securely to his side—an operation easily understood by all schoolboys who have ever been compelled to exercise their wits in securing a balance of power in a like way among ambitious rivals. As they stood, front to front opposed, the broad chest, square shoulders, voluminous muscle, and manly compass of the two, naturally secured the admiration of both. Supple Jack could not refrain from expressing his satisfaction. “It's a pleasure, Isaac Muggs, to have a turn with a man of your make. I ha'n't seen a finer bosom for a fight this many a day. I think, if any thing, you're a splinter or two fuller across the breast than me;—it may be fat, and if so, it's the worse for you,—but if it's the solid grain and gristle, then it's only the worse for me. It makes me saddish enough when I look on sich a bosom, to think that you're cut off one half in a fair allowance of arm. But I don't think that'll work agin you in this 'bout, for, you see, you're used to doing without it, and making up in a double use of t'other; and I'm beginning a'ready to feel as if I warnt of no use at all in the best part of my body. Let's feel o' your heft, old fellow.” A mutual lift being taken, they prepared to take hold for the grand trial, and Supple Jack soon discovered, as he had suspected, that the customary disuse of the arm gave to his opponent an advantage in this sort of conflict, which, taken in connexion with his naturally strong build of frame, rendered the task before him equally serious and doubtful. But, with a shake of the head as he made this acknowledgment, he laid his chin on the shoulder of the landlord, grasped him vigorously about the body; and Muggs, having secured a similar grasp, gave him the word, and they both swung round, under a mutual impulse, which, had there been any curious spectator at hand, would have left him very doubtful, for a long time, as to the distinct proprietorship of the several legs which so rapidly chased each other in the air. An amateur in such matters—a professional lover of the “fancy”—would make a ravishing picture of this conflict. The alternations of seeming success; the hopes, the fears, the occasional elevations of the one party, and the depressions of the other—the horizontal tendency of this or that head and shoulder—the yielding of this frame and the staggering of that leg—might, under the pencil of a master, be made to awaken as many sensibilities in the spectator as ever did the adroit deviltries of the modern Jack Sheppard. But these details must be left to artists of their own—to the Cruikshanks!—or that more popular, if less worthy, fraternity, the “Quiz,” “Phiz,” “Biz,” “Tiz,” &amp;c., whose sober industry keeps the jaws of modern wonder for ever on the stretch. We shall content ourselves with simply assuring our readers that in the struggle both of our champions behaved manfully. The conflict was protracted; the turf, forming a ring of twenty feet round, or more, was beaten smooth, and still the affair was undecided. Neither had yet received a fall. But Supple Jack, for reasons of his own, began to feel that the argument was about to be settled in favour of right principles. “Your breath's coming rether quick now, Isaac Muggs! —I'm thinking you'll soon be convarted! But it's a mighty strong devil you had in you, and I'm afeard he'll make my ribs ache for a week. I'll sprawl him, though, I warrant you.” “Don't be too sartin, Jack,” gasped the other. “Don't!—Why, love you, Muggs, you couldn't say that short speech over again for the life of you.” “Couldn't, eh!” “No, not for King George's axing.” “Think so, eh?” “Know so, man. Now, look to it. I'll only ax three tugs more. There—there's one.” “Nothing done, Jack.” “Two,—three! and where are you now!” cried the exulting scout, as he deprived his opponent of grasp and footing at the same moment, and whirled him, dizzy and staggering, heels up and head to the earth. But he was not suffered to reach it by that operation only. His course was accelerated by other hands; and three men, rushing with whoop and halloo from the copse, near which the struggle had been carried on, grappled with the fallen landlord, and plied him with a succession of blows, the least of which was unnecessary for his overthrow. It seemed that Supple Jack recognised these intruders almost in the moment of their appearance; but so sudden was their onset and so great their clamour, that his fierce cry to arrest them was unheard, and he could only make his wishes known by adopting the summary process of knocking two of them down by successive blows from the only fist which was left free for exercise. “How now! Who ax'd you to put your dirty fingers into my dish, Olin Massey—or you, Bob Jones—or you, Peyton Burns? This is your bravery, is it, to beat a man after I've down'd him, eh?” “But we didn't know that 'twas over, Sergeant. We thought you was a-wanting help;” replied the fellow who was called Massey—it would seem in mockery only. He was a little, dried up, withered atomy,—a jaundiced “sand-lapper,” or “clay-eater,” from the Wassamasaw country, whose insignificant size and mean appearance did very inadequate justice to his resolute, fierce, and implacable character. “And if I was a-wanting help, was you the man to give it? Go 'long, Olin Massey—you're a very young chap to be here. What makes you here, I want to know?” “Why, didn't you send us on the scout, jist here, in this very place?” said the puny, but pugnacious person addressed, with a fierceness of tone and gesture, and a fire in his eye, which the feebleness of his form did not in the least qualify. “Yes, to be sure; but why didn't you come? I've been here a matter of two hours by the sun; and as you didn't come, I reckoned you had taken track after some tory varmints, and had gone deeper into the swamp. You've dodged some tories, eh?” “No, ha'n't seed a soul.” “Then, by the Hokey, Olin Massey, you've been squat on a log, playing old sledge for pennies!” The scouting party looked down in silence. The little man from Wassamasaw felt his anger subside within him. “Corporal Massey, give me them painted bits, before they're the death of you. By old natur, betwixt cards and rum, I've lost more of my men than by Cunningham's bullets or Tarleton's broadswords. Give me them cards, Olin Massey, and make your respects to my good natur, that I don't blow you to the colonel.” The offender obeyed. He drew from his pocket in silence a pack of the dirtiest cards that ever were thumbed over a pine log, and delivered them to his superior with the air of a schoolboy from whom the master has cruelly taken, “at one fell swoop,” top, marbles, and ball. “There,” said Supple Jack, as he thrust them into his pocket—“I'll put them up safely, boys, and you shall have 'em again, for a whole night, after our next brush with the tories. Go you now and get your nags in readiness, while I see to Muggs. I'll j'in you directly at the red clay.” When they had disappeared, he turned to the landlord, who had meanwhile risen, though rather slowly, from the earth, and now stood a silent spectator of the interview. “Now, Muggs, I reckon we'll have to try the tug over agin. These blind boys of mine put in jest a moment too soon. They helped to flatten you, I'm thinking; and so, if you aint quite satisfied which way the truth is, it's easy to go it over again.” The offer was more liberal than Muggs expected or desired. He was already sufficiently convinced. “No, no, Supple, you're too much for me!” “It's the truth that's too much for you, Muggs—not me! I reckon you're satisfied now which way the truth is. You've got a right onderstanding in this business.” The landlord made some admissions, the amount of which, taken without circumlocution, was, that he had been whipped in a fair fight; and, according to all the laws of war, as well as common sense, that he was now at the disposal of the victor. His acknowledgments were sufficiently satisfactory. “We've prayed for it, Muggs, and jest as we prayed we got it. You're rubbing your legs and your sides, but what's a bruise and a pain in the side, or even a broken rib, when we've got the truth. After that, a hurt of the body is a small matter; and then a man don't much fear any sort of danger. Let me know that I'm in the right way, and that justice is on my side, and I don't see the danger, though it stands in the shape of the biggest gun-muzzle that ever bellowed from the walls of Charlestown in the great siege. Now, Muggs, since you say now that you onderstand the argyment I set you, and that you agree to have your liberties the same as the rest of us, I'll jist open your eyes to a little of the risk you've been a-running for the last few days. Look—read this here letter, and see if you can recollect the writing.” The blood left the cheeks of the landlord the instant that the scout handed him the letter. VOL. I. 15 “Where did you fine it, Supple?” he gasped apprehensively. “Find it! I first found the sculp of the chap that carried it,” was the cool reply. “But you answer to the writing, don't you—it's your'n.” “Well, I reckon you know it, Supple, without my saying so.” “Reckon I do, Muggs,—it's pretty well known in these parts; and s'pose any of our boys but me had got hold of it? Where would you be, I wonder? Swinging on one of the oak limbs before your own door, dangling a good pair of legs of no sort of use to yourself or any body else. But I'm your friend, Muggs; a better friend to you than you've been to yourself. I come and argy the matter with you, and reason with you to your onderstanding, and make a convarsion of you without trying to frighten you into it. Now that you see the error of your ways, I show you their danger also. This letter is tory all over, but there's one thing in it that made me have marcy upon you—it's here, jist in the middle, where you beg that bloody tory, Ned Conway, to have marcy on his brother. Any body that speaks friendly, or kind, of Clarence Conway, I'll help him if I can. Now, Muggs, I'll go with you to your house, and there I'll burn this letter in your own sight, so that it'll never rise up in judgment agen you. But you must make a clean breast of it. You must tell me all you know, that I may be sure you feel the truth according to the lesson, which, with the helping of God, I've been able to give you.” The landlord felt himself at the mercy of the scout; but the generous treatment which he had received from the worthy fellow—treatment so unwonted at that period of wanton bloodshed and fierce cruelty—inclined him favourably to the cause, the arguments for which had been produced by so liberal a disputant. His own policy, to which we have already adverted more than once, suggested far better; and, if the landlord relented at all in his revelations, it was with the feeling—natural, perhaps, to every mind, however lowly—which makes it revolt at the idea of becoming treacherous, even to the party which it has joined for purposes of treachery. The information which the scout obtained, and which was valuable to the partisans, he drew from the relator by piecemeal. Every item of knowledge was drawn from him by its own leading question, and yielded with broken utterance, and the half vacant look of one who is only in part conscious, as he is only in part willing. “Pretty well, Muggs, though you don't come out like a man who felt the argyment at the bottom of his onderstanding. There's something more now. In this bit of writing there's a line or two about one Peter Flagg, who, it seems, carried forty-one niggers to town last January, and was to ship 'em to the West Indies. Now, can you tell if he did ship them niggers?” “I can't exactly now, Supple—it's onbeknown to me.” “But how come you to write about this man and them niggers?” “Why, you see, Peter Flagg was here looking after the captain?” “Ah! he was here, was he?” “Yes—he j'ined the captain jest before Butler's men gin him that chase.” “He's with Ned Conway then, is he?” “No, I reckon not. He didn't stay with the captain but half a day.” “Ah! ha!—and where did he go then?” “Somewhere across the river.” “Below, I'm thinking.” “Yes, he took the lower route—I reckon he went towards the Santee.” “Isaac Muggs, don't you know that the business of Pete Flagg is to ship stolen niggers to the West India Islands?” “Well, Supple, I believe it is, though I don't know.” “That's enough about Pete. Now, Muggs, when did you see Watson Gray last? You know the man I mean. He comes from the Congaree near Granby. He's the one that watches Briar Park for Ned Conway, and brings him in every report about the fine bird that keeps there. You know what bird I mean, don't you?” “Miss Flora, I reckon.” “A very good reckon. Well! you know Gray?” “Yes—he's a great scout—the best, after you, I'm thinking, on the Congaree.” “Before me, Muggs,” said the scout, with a sober shake of the head. “He's before me, or I'd ha' trapped him many's the long day ago. He's the only outlyer I acknowledge on the river: but he's a skunk—a bad chap about the heart. His bosom's full of black places. He loves to do ugly things, and to make a brag of 'em afterward, and that's a bad character for a good scout. But that's neither here nor there. I only want you now to think up, and tell me when he was here last.” “Well!—” “Ah, don't stop to `well' about it,” cried the other impatiently—“speak out like a bold man that's jest got the truth. Wan't Watson Gray here some three days ago—before the troop came down—and didn't he leave a message by word of mouth with you? Answer me that, Muggs, like a good whig as you ought to be.” “It's true as turpentine, Supple; but, Lord love you, how did you come to guess it?” “No matter that!—up now, and tell me what that same message was.” “That's a puzzler, I reckon, for I didn't onderstand it all myself. There was five sticks and two bits of paper —on one was a long string of multiplication and 'rithmetic—figures and all that;—on the other was a sort of drawing that looked most like a gal on horseback.” “Eh!—The gal on horseback was nateral enough. Perhaps I can make out that; but the bits of stick and 'rithmetic is all gibberish. Wan't there nothing that you had to say by word of mouth to Ned Conway?” “Yes, to be sure. He left word as how the whigs was getting thicker and thicker—how Sumter and Lee marked all the road from Granby down to Orangeburg with their horse-tracks, and never afeard; and how Greene was a-pushing across toward Ninety-Six, where he was guine to 'siege Cruger.” “Old news, Muggs, and I reckon you've kept back the best for the last. What did he have to say 'bout Miss Flora? Speak up to that!” “Not a word. I don't think he said any thing more, onless it was something about boats being a-plenty, and no danger of horse-tracks on the river.” “There's a meaning in that; and I must spell it out,” said the scout; “but now, Muggs, another question or two. Who was the man that Ned Conway sent away prisoner jest before day?” “Lord, Supple, you sees every thing!” ejaculated the landlord. Pressed by the wily scout, he related, with tolerable correctness, all the particulars of the affray the night before between the captain of the Black Riders and his subordinate; and threw such an additional light upon the causes of quarrel between them as suggested to the scout a few new measures of policy. “Well, Muggs,” said he, at the close, “I'll tell you something in return for all you've told me. My boys caught that same Stockton and trapped his guard in one hour after they took the road; and I'm glad to find, by putting side by side what they confessed and what you tell me, that you've stuck to the truth like a gentleman and a whig. They didn't tell me about the lieutenant's wanting to be captain, but that's detarmined me to parole the fellow that he may carry on his mischief in the troop. I'm going to leave you now, Muggs, but you'll see an old man coming here to look after a horse about midday. Give him a drink, and say to him, that you don't know nothing about the horse, but there's a hound on track after something, that went barking above, three hours before. That'll sarve his purpose and mine too: and now, God bless you, old boy, and, remember, I'm your friend, and I can do you better sarvice now than any two Black Riders of the gang. As I've convarted you, I'll stand by you, and I'll never be so far off in the swamp that I can't hear your grunting, and come out to 15* your help. So, good bye, and no more forgitting of that argyment.” “And where are you going now, Supple?” “Psha, boy, that's telling. Was I to let you know that, Watson Gray might worm it out from under your tongue, without taking a wrastle for it. I'll tell you when I come back.” And with a good-humoured chuckle the scout disappeared, leaving the landlord to meditate, at his leisure, upon the value of those arguments which had made him in one day resign a faith which had been cherished as long—as it had proved profitable. Muggs had no hope that the new faith would prove equally so; but if it secured to him the goodly gains of the past, he was satisfied. Like many of the tories at this period, he received a sudden illumination, which showed him in one moment the errors for which he had been fighting five years. Let not this surprise our readers. In the closing battles of the Revolution in South Carolina, many were the tories converted to the patriot cause, who, at the eleventh hour, displayed the most conspicuous bravery fighting on the popular side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. GLIMPSES OF PASSION AND ITS FRUITS. Supple Jack soon joined his commander, bringing with him, undiminished by use or travel, all the various budgets of intelligence which he had collected in his scout. He had dismissed the insubordinate lieutenant of the Black Riders on parole; not without suffering him to hear, as a familiar on dit along the river, that Captain Morton was about to sacrifice the troop at the first opportunity, and fly with all his booty from the country. “I've know'd,” said he to himself, after Stockton took his departure, “I've know'd a smaller spark than that set off a barrel of gunpowder.” To his colonel, having delivered all the intelligence which he had gained of the movements as well of the public as private enemy, he proceeded, as usual, to give such counsel as the nature of his revelations seemed to suggest. This may be summed up in brief, without fatiguing the reader with the detailed conversation which ensued between them in their examination of the subject. “From what I see, colonel, Ned Conway is gone below. It's true he did seem to take the upper route, but Massey can't find the track after he gits to Fisher's Slue. There, I reckon, he chopped right round, crossed the Slue, I'm thinking, and dashed below. Well, what's he gone below for, and what's Pete Flagg gone for across to the Santee?—Pete, that does nothing but ship niggers for the British officers. They all see that they're got to go, and they're for making hay while the sun is still a-shining. Now, I'm thinking that Ned Conway is after your mother's niggers. He'll steal 'em and ship 'em by Pete Flagg to the West Indies, and be the first to follow, the moment that Rawdon gits licked by Greene. It's cl'ar to me that you ought to go below and see about the business.” The arguments of the woodman were plausible enough, and Clarence Conway felt them in their fullest force. But he had his doubts about the course alleged to be taken by his kinsman, and a feeling equally selfish, perhaps, but more noble intrinsically, made him fancy that his chief interest lay above. He was not insensible to his mother's and his own probable loss, should the design of Edward Conway really be such as Bannister suggested, but a greater stake, in his estimation, lay in the person of the fair Flora Middleton; and he could not bring himself to believe, valuing her charms as he did himself, that his kinsman would forego such game for the more mercenary objects involved in the other adventure. The tenor of the late interview between himself and the chief of the Black Riders, had forced his mind to brood with serious anxiety on the probable fortunes of this lady; and his own hopes and fears becoming equally active at the same time, the exulting threats and bold assumptions of Edward Conway—so very different from the sly humility of his usual deportment—awakened all his apprehensions. He resolved to go forward to the upper Congaree, upon the pleasant banks of which stood the princely domains of the Middleton family; persuaded, as he was, that the rival with whom he contended for so great a treasure, equally wily and dishonourable, had in contemplation some new villany, which, if not seasonably met, would result in equal loss to himself and misery to the maiden of his heart. Yet he did not resolve thus, without certain misgivings and self-reproaches. His mother was quite as dear to him as ever mother was to the favourite son of her affections. He knew the danger in which her property stood, and was not heedless of the alarm which she would experience, in her declining years and doubtful health, at the inroad of any marauding foe. The arguments of a stronger passion, however, prevailed above these apprehensions, and he contented himself with a determination to make the best of his way below, as soon as he had assured himself of the safety and repose of every thing above. Perhaps, too, he had a farther object in this contemplated visit to Flora Middleton. The counsel of Bannister on a previous occasion, which urged upon him to bring his doubts to conviction on the subject of the course which her feelings might be disposed to take, found a corresponding eagerness in his own heart to arrive at a knowledge always so desirable to a lover, and which he seeks in fear and trembling as well as in hope. “I will but see her,” was his unuttered determination, “I will but see her, and see that she is safe, and hear at once her final answer. These doubts are too painful for endurance! Better to hear the worst at once, than live always in apprehension of it.” Leaving the youthful partisan to pursue his own course, let us now turn for a while to that of Edward Morton, and the gloomy and fierce banditti which he commanded. He has already crossed the Wateree, traversed the country between that river and the Congaree; and after various small adventures, such as might be supposed likely to occur in such a progress, but which do not demand from us any more special notice, we find him on the banks of the latter stream, in the immediate neighbourhood of a spot where it receives into its embrace the twin though warring waters of the Saluda and the Broad—a spot, subsequently, better distinguished as the chosen site of one of the loveliest towns of the State— the seat of its capital, and of refinement, worth, courtesy, and taste, which are not often equalled in any region, and are certainly surpassed in none. Columbia, however, at the period of our story, was not in existence; and the meeting of its tributary waters, their striving war, incessant rivalry, and the continual clamours of their strife, formed the chief distinction of the spot; and conferred upon it no small degree of picturesque vitality and loveliness. A few miles below, on the opposite side of the stream, stood then the flourishing town of Granby—a place of considerable magnitude and real importance to the wants of the contiguous country, but now fallen into decay and utterly deserted. A garrisoned town of the British, it had just before this period been surrendered by Colonel Maxwell to the combined American force under Sumter and Lee—an event which counselled the chief of the Black Riders to an increased degree of caution as he approached a neighbourhood so likely to be swarming with enemies. Here we may as well communicate to the reader such portions of the current history of the time, as had not yet entirely reached this wily marauder. While he was pursuing his personal and petty objects of plunder on the Wateree, Lord Rawdon had fled from Camden, which he left in flames; Sumter had taken Orangeburg; Fort Motte had surrendered to Marion; the British had been compelled to evacuate their post at Nelson's Ferry, and the only fortified place of which they now kept possession in the interior was that of Ninety-Six; a station of vast importance to their interests in the back country, and which, accordingly, they resolved to defend to the last extremity. But though ignorant of some of the events here brought together, Edward Morton was by no means ignorant of the difficulties which were accumulating around the fortunes of the British, and which, he naturally enough concluded, must result in these, and even worse disasters. Of the fall of Granby he was aware; of the audacity and number of the American parties, his scouts hourly informed him, even if his own frequent and narrow escapes had failed to awaken him to a sense of the prevailing dangers. But, governed by an intense selfishness, he had every desire to seek, in increased caution, for the promotion of those interests and objects, without which his patriotism might possibly have been less prudent, and of the proper kind. He had neither wish nor motive to go forward rashly; and, accordingly, we find him advancing to the Saluda, with the slow, wary footsteps of one who looks to behold his enemy starting forth, without summons of trumpet, from the bosom of every brake along the route. It was noon when his troop reached the high banks of the river, the murmur of whose falls, like the distant mutterings of ocean upon some island-beach, were heard, pleasantly soothing, in the sweet stillness of a forest noon. A respite was given to the employments of the troop. Scouts were sent out, videttes stationed, and the rest surrendered themselves to repose, each after his own fashion: some to slumber, some to play, while others, like their captain, wandered off to the river banks, to angle or to meditate, as their various moods might incline. Morton went apart from the rest, and found a sort of hiding-place upon a rock immediately overhanging the river, where, surrounded by an umbrageous forest-growth, he threw his person at length, and yielded himself up to those brooding cares which he felt were multiplying folds about his mind, in the entangling grasp of which it worked slowly and without its usual ease and elasticity. The meditations are inevitably mournful with a spirit such as his. Guilt is a thing of isolation always, even when most surrounded by its associates and operations. Its very insecurity tends to its isolation as completely as its selfishness. Edward Morton felt all this. He had been toiling, and not in vain, for a mercenary object. His spoils had been considerable. He had hoarded up a secret treasure in another country, secure from the vicissitudes which threatened every fortune in that where he had won it; but he himself was insecure. Treachery, he began to believe, and not a moment too soon, was busy all around him. He had kept down fear, and doubt, and distrust, by a life of continual action; but it was in moments of repose like this, that he himself found none. It was then that his fears grew busy—that he began to distrust his fate, and to apprehend that all that future, which he fondly fancied to pass in serenity of fortune, if not of mind and feeling, would yet be clouded and compassed with denial. His eye, stretching away on either hand, beheld the two chafing rivers rushing downward to that embrace which they seem at once to desire and to avoid. A slight barrier of land and shrubbery interposes to prevent their too sudden meeting. Little islands throw themselves between, as if striving to thwart the fury of their wild collision, but in vain! The impetuous waters force their way against every obstruction; and wild and angry, indeed, as if endued with moral energies and a human feeling of hate, is their first encounter—their recoil—their return to the conflict, in foam and roar, and commotion, until exhaustion terminates the strife, and they at length repose together in the broad valleys of the Congaree below. The turbulence of the scene alone interested the dark-bosomed spectator whose fortunes we contemplate. He saw neither its sublime nor its gentle features—its fair groves—its sweet islands of rock and tufted vegetation, upon which the warring waters, as if mutually struggling to do honour to their benevolent interposition, fling over their flashing, and transparent wreaths of whitish foam. His moody thought was busy in likening the prospect to that turbulence, the result of wild purposes and wicked desires, which filled his own bosom. A thousand impediments, like the numerous rocks and islands that rose to obstruct the passage of the streams which he surveyed, lay in his course, baffling his aim, driving him from his path, resisting his desires, and scattering inefficiently all his powers. Even as the wates which he beheld, complaining in the fruitless conflict with the rude masses from which they momently recoiled, so did he, unconsciously, break into speech, as the difficulties in his own future progress grew more and more obvious to his reflections. “There must soon be an end to this. That old fool was right. I should be a fool to wait to see it. Once, twice, thrice, already, have I escaped, when death seemed certain. Let me not provoke fortune—let me not task her too far. It will be impossible to baffle these bloodhounds much longer! Their scent is too keen, their numbers too great, and the spoil too encouraging. Besides, I have done enough. I have proved my loyalty. Loyalty indeed!—a profitable pretext—and there will be no difficulty now in convincing Rawdon that I ought to be the last to linger here in waiting for the end. That end—what shall it be?—A hard fight—a bloody field—a sharp pain and quiet! Quiet!—that were something, too, might almost reconcile one to linger. Could I be secure of that, at the risk of a small pain only; but it may be worse. Captivity were something worse than death. In their hands, alive, and no Spanish tortures would equal mine. No! no! I must not encounter that danger. I must keep in reserve one weapon at least, consecrated to the one purpose. This—this! must secure me from captivity!” He drew from his bosom, as he spoke these words, a small poniard of curious manufacture, which he contemplated with an eye of deliberate study; as if the exquisite Moorish workmanship of the handle, and the rich and variegated enamel of the blade, served to promote the train of gloomy speculation into which he had fallen. A rustling of the leaves—the slight step of a foot immediately behind him—caused him to start to his feet;—but he resumed his place with an air of vexation, as he beheld, in the intruder, the person of the boy whom we have seen once before in close attendance upon him. “How now!” he exclaimed impatiently, “can I have no moment to myself—why will you thus persist in following me.” “I have no one else to follow, was the meek reply— the tones falling, as it were, in echo from a weak and withered heart. “I have no one else to follow, and— and—” The lips faltered into silence. “Speak out—and what?—” “You once said to me that I should go with none but you—oh, Edward Conway, spurn me not—drive me not away with those harsh looks and cruel accents; —let me linger beside you—though if you please it, still out of your sight, for I am desolate—oh! so desolate, when you leave me!—you, who, alone, of all the world, VOL. I. 16 I may have some right to look to for protection and for life.” The sex of the speaker stood revealed—in the heaving breast—the wo-begone countenance—the heart-broken despondency of look and gesture—the tear-swollen and down-looking eye. She threw herself before him as she spoke, her face buried in her hands and prone upon the ground. Her sobs succeeded her speech and in fact silenced it. “No more of this, Mary Clarkson, you disturb and vex me. Rise. I have seen, for some days past, that you had some new tribulation—some new burden of wo to deliver—out with it now—say what you have to say;—and, look you, no whinings. Life is too seriously full of real evils, dangers and difficulties, to suffer me to bear with these imaginary afflictions.” “Oh, God, Edward Conway, it is not imaginary with me. It is real—it is to be seen—to be felt. I am dying with it. It is in my pale cheek—my burning brain, in which there is a constant fever. Oh, look not upon me thus—thus angrily—for, in truth I am dying. I feel it! I know that I cannot live very long;—and yet, I am so afraid to die. It is this fear, Edward Conway, that makes me intrude upon you now.” “And what shall I do, and what shall I say to lessen your fears of death? And, why should I do it—why, yet more, should you desire it? Death is or ought to be a very good thing for one who professes to be so very miserable in life as yourself. You heard me as you approached?—if you did you must have heard my resolution to seek death, from my own weapon, under certain circumstances. Now, it is my notion that whenever life becomes troublesome, sooner than grumble at it hourly, I should make use of some small instrument like this. A finger-prick only—no greater pain— will suffice, and put an end to life and pain in the same instant.” “Would it could! would it could!” exclaimed the unfortunate victim of that perfidy which now laughed her miseries to scorn. “Why, so it can! Do you doubt? I tell you, that there is no more pain, Mary, in driving this dagger into your heart—into its most tender and vital places—than there would be, burying it in your finger. Death will follow, and there's the end of it.” “Not the end, not the end—if it were, Edward Conway, how gladly would I implore from your hand the blessing of that lasting peace which would follow from its blow. It is the hereafter—the awful hereafter— which I fear to meet.” “Pshaw! a whip of the hangman—a bugbear of the priests, for fools and women! I'll warrant you, if you are willing to try the experiment, perfect security from all pain hereafter!” And the heartless wretch extended toward her the hand which contained the glittering weapon. She shuddered and turned away—giving him, as she did so, such a look as even he, callous as he was, shrunk to behold. A glance of reproach, more keen, deep, and touching than any word of complaint which her lips had ever ventured to utter. “Alas! Edward Conway, has it really come to this! To you I have yielded every thing—virtue, peace of mind—the love of father, and of mother, and of friends —all that's most dear—all that the heart deems most desirable—and you offer me, in return, for these— death, death!—the sharp, sudden poniard—the cold, cold grave! If you offer it, Edward Conway—strike! —the death is welcome! Even the fear of it is forgotten. Strike, set me free;—I will vex you no longer with my presence.” “Why, what a peevish fool you are, Mary Clarkson! though, to be sure, you are not very different from the rest. There's no pleasing any of you, do as we may. You first came to me to clamour about your distaste of life, and by your perpetual grumblings you seek to make it as distasteful to me as to yourself. Well, I tell you—this is my remedy!—this sudden, sharp dagger— whenever I shall come to regard life as a thing of so much misery as you do, I shall end it; and I also add, in the benevolence of my heart—`here is my medicament—I share it with you!'—and lo! what an uproar— what a howling. Look you, Mary, you must trouble me no longer in this manner, and just now, in the worst possible mood to bear with the best friend under the sun.” “Oh, Edward Conway, and this too!—this, after your promise! Do you remember your promise to me, by the Poplar Spring, that hour of my shame!—that awful hour! Oh, what was that promise, Edward Conway? Speak, Edward Conway! Repeat that promise and confess I was not all guilty. No! no!—I was only all credulous! You beguiled me with a promise—with an oath—a solemn oath before Heaven—did you not? —that I should be your wife. Till then, at least, I was not guilty!” “Did I really make such a promise to you—eh?” he asked with a scornful affectation of indifference. “Surely, you will not deny that you did?” she exclaimed with an earnestness which was full of amazement. “Well, I scarcely remember. But it matters not much, Mary Clarkson. You were a fool for believing. How could you suppose that I would marry you? Ha! Is it so customary for pride and poverty to unite on the Congaree that you should believe? Is it customary for the eldest son of one of the wealthiest families to wed with the child of one of the poorest? Why, you should have known by the promise itself, that I was amusing myself with your credulity—that my only object was to beguile you—to win you on my own terms—not to wear you!—I simply stooped for conquest, Mary Clarkson, and you were willing to believe any lie for the same object. It was your vanity that beguiled you, Mary Clarkson, and not my words. You wished to be a fine lady, and you are—” “Oh, do not stop. Speak it all out. Give to my folly and my sin its true name. I can bear to hear it now, without shrinking, for my own thoughts have already spoken to my heart the foul and fearful truth. I am, indeed, loathsome to myself, and would not care to live but that I fear to die. 'Tis not the love of life that makes me turn in fear from the dagger which you offer. This, Edward Morton—'tis this which brings me to you now. I do not seek you for guidance or for counsel—no! no!—no such folly moves me now. I come to you for protection—for safety—for security from sudden death—from the judge—from the avenger. He is pursuing us—I have seen him!”—and as she spoke these almost incoherent words, her eye looked wildly among the thick woods around, and full of apprehension, as if the danger she spoke of was in reality at hand. Surprise was clearly expressed in the features of her callous paramour. “He! Of whom speak you, child! Who is it you fear?” and his glance followed the wild direction of her eyes. “My father!—Jacob Clarkson! He is in search of me—of you!—and oh! Edward Conway, I know him so well, that I tell you, it will not be your high connexions and aristocratic birth that will save you on the Congaree from a poor man's rifle, though these may make it a trifling thing for you to ruin a poor man's child. He is even now in search of us—I have seen him!—I have seen the object of his whole soul in his eye, as I have seen it an hundred times before. He will kill you—he will kill us both, Edward Conway, but he will have revenge!” “Pshaw, girl! You are very foolish. How can your father find us out? How approach us? The thought is folly. As an individual he can only approach us by coming into the line of our sentinels—these disarm him, and he then might look upon us, in each other's arms, without being able to do us any injury.” “Do not speak so, Edward, for God's sake—in each each other's arms no longer—no more!”—and a sort of shivering horror passed over her frame as she spoke these words. “As you please!” muttered the outlaw, with an air and smile of scornful indifference. The girl proceeded:— “But, even without weapons, the sight of my father 16* —the look of his eyes upon mine—would kill me— would be worse than any sort of death. Oh, God! let me never see him more. Let him never see me—the child that has lost him, lost herself, and is bringing his gray hairs in sorrow to the grave.” “Mary Clarkson, who do you think to cheat with all this hypocrisy of sentiment. Don't I know that all those fine words and phrases are picked out of books. This talk is too customary to be true.” “They may be!—they were books, Edward Conway, which you brought me, and which I loved to read for your sake. Alas! I did not follow their lessons.” “Enough of this stuff, and now to the common sense of this business. You have seen your father, you say—where?” “On the Wateree;—the day before you came back from your brother in the swamp!” “Brother me no brothers!” exclaimed the outlaw fiercely, “and look you, girl, have I not told you a thousand times that I wish not to be called Conway. Call me Morton, Cunningham, John Stuart, or the devil—or any of the hundred names by which my enemies distinguish me and denominate my deeds; but call me not by the name of Conway. I, too, have something filial in my nature; and if you wish not to see the father you have offended, perhaps, it is for the same reason that I would not hear the name of mine. Let that dutiful reason content you—it may be that I have others; but these we will forbear for the present. What of Jacob Clarkson, when you saw him? Where was he?—how employed?—and where were you, and who with you?” “Oh, God! I was fearfully nigh to him, and he saw me!—He fixed his keen, cold, deathly eye upon me, and I thought I should have sunk under it. I thought he knew me; but how could he in such a guise as this, and looking, as I do, pale, withered, and broken down with sin and suffering.” “Pshaw—where was all this?” “At Isaac's tavern. There was none there beside myself and Isaac. He came in and asked for a calabash of water. He would drink nothing, though Muggs kindly offered him, but he would not. He looked at me only for an instant, but it seemed to me, in that instant, that he looked through and through my soul. He said nothing to me, and hardly any thing to Isaac— though he asked him several questions;—and when he drank the water, and rested for a little while, he went away. But while he stayed I thought I should have died. I could have buried myself in the earth to escape his sight; and yet how I longed to throw myself at his feet and beg for mercy. Could I have done that, I think I should have been happy. I should have been willing then to die. But I dared not. He hadn't a human look —he didn't seem to feel;—and I feared that he might kill me without hearkening to my prayer.” “Muggs should have told me of this,” said the other musingly. “He must have forgot it, on account of the uproar and great confusion afterwards.” “That is no good reason for a cool fellow like him. I must see into it. It was a strange omission.” “But what will you do, Edward—where shall we fly?” “Fly! where should we fly—and why? Because of your father? Have I not already told you that he cannot approach us to do harm; and, as for discovering us, have you not seen that he looked upon his own child without knowing her, and I'm sure he can never recollect me as the man who once helped him to provide for the only undutiful child he had.” “Spare me! Be not so cruel in your words, Edward, for, of a truth, though I may escape the vengeance of my father, I feel certain that I have not long—not very long to live.” “Nor I, Mary;—so while life lasts, let us be up and doing!” was the cold-blooded reply, as, starting to his feet, as if with the desire to avoid farther conference on an annoying subject, he prepared to leave the spot where it had taken place. Her lips moved, but she spoke not. Her hands were clasped, but the entreaty which they expressed, were lost equally upon his eyes and heart; and if she meant to pray to him for a farther hearing, her desire was unexpressed in any stronger form. By him it remained unnoticed. Was it unnoticed by the overlooking and observant God!—for to him, when the other had gone from sight and hearing, were her prayers then offered, with, seemingly, all the sincerity of a broken and a contrite spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. A GLIMPSE OF BRIAR PARK: THE OATH OF THE BLACK RIDERS. By evening of the same day, the scouts made their appearance, and their reports were such as to determine the captain of the Black Riders to cross the Congaree and pursue his objects, whatever they might be, along its southern banks. Sufficient time for rest had been allotted to his troop. He believed they had employed it as assigned, little dreaming how busy some of them had been, in the concoction of schemes, which, if in character not unlike his own, were scarcely such as were congenial with his authority or his desires. But these are matters for the future. Though resolved on crossing the river, yet, as the chosen ferry lay several miles below, it became necessary to sound to horse; and about dusk the troop was again put in motion, and continued on their route till midnight. They had compassed but a moderate distance in this space of time, moving as they did with great precaution—slowly, of course, as was necessary while traversing a country supposed to be in the full possession of an enemy, and over roads, which, in those days, were neither very distinct, nor fairly open, nor in the best condition. They reached the ferry, but halted for the remainder of the night without making any effort to cross. At the dawn of day, Mary Clarkson, still seemingly a boy, was one of the first, stealing along the bank of the river, to remark the exquisite beauty of the prospect which on every side opened upon her eye. The encampment of the Black Riders had been made along the river bluff, but sufficiently removed from its edge to yield the requisite degree of woodland shelter. The spot chosen for the purpose was a ridge unusually elevated for that portion of the stream, which is commonly skirted by an alluvial bottom of the richest swamp undergrowth. This, on either hand, lay below, while the river, winding upon its way in the foreground, was as meek and placid as if it never knew obstacle or interruption. Yet, but a few miles above, how constant had been its strife with the rocks— how unceasing its warring clamours. But a few of these obstructions, and these were obstructions in appearance only, occurred immediately at the point before us; and these, borne down by the violence of the conflict carried on above, might seem rather the trophies of its own triumph which the river brought away with it in its downward progress; serving rather to overcome the monotony of its surface, and increase the picturesque of its prospect, than as offering any new obstacle, or as provoking to any farther strife. Its waters broke with a gentle violence on their rugged tops, and passed over and around them with a slight murmur, which was quite as clearly a murmur of merriment as one of annoyance. Around, the foliage grew still in primitive simplicity. There, the long-leafed pine, itself the evidence of a forest undishonoured by the axe, reared its lofty brow, soaring and stooping, a giant surveying his domain. About him, not inferior in pride and majesty, though perhaps inferior in height, were a numerous growth of oaks, of all the varieties common to the region;—tributary, as beauty still must ever be to strength, were the rich and various hues of the bay, the poplar, the dogwood, and the red bud of the sassafras—all growing and blooming in a profligate luxuriance, unappreciated and unemployed, as if the tastes of the Deity, quite as active as his benevolence, found their own sufficient exercise in the contemplation of such a treasure, though man himself were never to be created for its future enjoyment. But beyond lay a prospect in which art, though co-operating with nature to the same end, had proved herself a dangerous rival. Stretching across the stream, the eye took in, at a glance, the territory of one of those proud baronial privileges of Carolina—the seat of one of her short-lived nobility—broad fields, smooth-shaven lawns, green meadows melting away into the embrace of the brown woods—fair gardens—moss-covered and solemn groves; and, in the midst of all, and over all—standing upon the crown of a gently slopinghill, one of those stern, strong, frowning fabrics of the olden time, which our ancestors devised to answer the threefold purposes of the dwelling, the chapel, and the castle for defence. There, when the courage of the frontier-men first broke ground, and took possession, among the wild and warlike hunters of the Santee, the Congaree, and the Saluda, did the gallant General Middleton plant his towers, amidst a region of great perils, but of great natural beauty. With a fearless soul, he united an exquisite taste, and for its indulgence he was not unwilling to encounter the perils of the remote wilderness to which he went. Perhaps, too, the picturesque of the scenery was heightened to his mind by the dangers which were supposed to environ it; and the forest whose frowning shades discouraged most others, did not lose any of its attractions in his sight, because it sometimes tasked him to defend his possessions by the strong arm and the ready weapon. The bear disputed with him the possession of the honey-tree; and the red man, starting up, at evening, from the thicket, not unfrequently roused him with his fearful halloo, to betake himself to those defences, which made his habitation a fortress no less than a dwelling. But these, which are difficulties to the slothful, and terrors to the timid, gave a zest to adventure, which sweetens enterprise in the estimation of the brave; and it did not lessen the value of Briar Park to its first proprietor because he was sometimes driven to stand a siege from the red men of the Congaree. But the red men disappeared, and with them the daring adventurer who planted his stakes, among the first, in the bosom of their wild possessions. He, too, followed them at the appointed season; and his proud old domains fell into the hands of gentler proprietors. Under the countenance of her venerable grandmother, Flora Middleton —truly a rose in the wilderness—blossomed almost alone; at a time when the region in which the barony stood, was covered with worse savages than even the Congarees had been in the days of their greatest license. But the besom of war—which swept the country as with flame and sword—had paused in its ravages at this venerated threshold. With whig and tory alike, the name of old General Middleton, the patriarch of the Congaree country, was held equally sacred;—and the lovely granddaughter who inherited his wealth, though celebrated equally as a belle and a rebel, was suffered to hold her estates and opinions without paying those heavy penalties which, in those days, the possession of either was very likely to incur. Some trifling exceptions to this general condition of indulgence might occasionally take place. Sometimes a marauding party trespassed upon the hen-roost, or made a bolder foray into the cattle-yard and store-houses; but these petty depredations sunk out of sight in comparison with the general state of insecurity and robbery which prevailed every where else. The more serious annoyances to which the inhabitants of Briar Park were subject, arose from the involuntary hospitality which they were compelled to exercise towards the enemies of their country. Flora Middleton had been forced to receive with courtesy the “amiable” Cornwallis, and the brutal Ferguson; and to listen with complacency to words of softened courtesy and compliment from lips which had just before commanded to the halter a score of her countrymen, innocent of all offence, except that of defending, with the spirit of manhood and filial love, the soil which gave them birth. The equally sanguinary and even more stern Rawdon—the savage Tarleton, and the fierce and malignant Cunningham, had also been her uninvited guests, to whom she had done the honours of the house with the grace and spirit natural to her name and education, but never at the expense of her patriotism. “My fair foe, Flora,” was the phrase with which—with unaccustomed urbanity of temper, Lord Cornwallis was wont to acknowledge, but never to resent, in any other way—the boldness of her spoken sentiments. These she declared, with equal modesty and firmness, whenever their expression became necessary; and keen as might be her sarcasm, it bore with it its own antidote, in the quiet, subdued, ladylike tone in which it was uttered, and the courteous manner which accompanied it. Grace and beauty may violate many laws with impunity, and praise, not punishments, will still follow the offender. Such was the happy fortune of Flora Middleton—one of those youthful beauties of Carolina, whose wit, whose sentiment, pride and patriotism, acknowledged equally by friend and foe, exercised a wondrous influence over the events of the war, which is yet to be acknowledged in a becoming manner. The poor outcast, Mary Clarkson—a beauty, also, at one time, in her rustic sphere, and one whose sensibilities had been unhappily heightened by the very arts employed by her seducer to effect her ruin—gazed, with a mournful sentiment of satisfaction, at the sweet and picturesque beauty of the scene. Already was she beginning to lose herself in that dreamy languor of thought which hope itself suggests to the unhappy as a means to escape from wo, when she found her reckless betrayer suddenly standing by her side. “Ha, Mary, you are on the look-out, I see—you have a taste, I know. What think you of the plantations opposite. See how beautifully the lawn slopes up from the river to the foot of the old castle, a glimpse of whose gloomy, frowning visage, meets your eye through that noble grove of water oaks that link their arms across the passage and conceal two-thirds—no less—of the huge fabric to which they lead. There now, to the right, what a splendid field of corn—what an ocean of green leaves. On the left do you see a clump of oaks and sycamores,—there, to itself, away—a close dense clump, on a little hillock, itself a sort of emerald in the clearing around it. There stands the vault—the tomb of the Middleton family. Old Middleton himself sleeps there, if he can be said to sleep at all, for they tell strange VOL. I. 17 stories of his nightly rambles after wolves and copper-skins. You may see a small gray spot, like a chink of light, peeping out of the grove—that is the tomb. It is a huge, square apartment,—I have been in it more than once,—partly beneath and partly above the ground, and has hid many more living than it will ever hold dead men. I owe it thanks for more than one concealment myself.” “You?” “Yes! I have had a very comfortable night's rest in it, all things considered; and the probability is not small that we shall take our sleep in it to-night. How like you the prospect?” The girl shuddered. He did not care for any other answer, but proceeded. “In that old cage of Middleton there is a bird of sweetest song, whom I would set free. Do you guess what I mean, Mary?” The girl confessed her ignorance. “You are dull, Mary, but you shall grow wiser before long. Enough for the present—we must set the troop in motion. A short mile below and we find our crossing place, and then—hark you, Mary, you must keep a good look-out to-night. If there was mischief yesterday, it is not yet cured. There is more to-day. I shall expect you to watch to-night, while I prey.” He chuckled at the passing attempt at a sort of wit, in which, to do him justice, he did not often indulge, and the point of which his companion did not perceive, —then continued: “Perhaps it should be `prowl' rather than watch. Though, to prowl well requires the best of watching. You must do both. You prowl while I prey—do you understand?” He had given a new form to his phrase, by which he made his humour obvious; and, satisfied with this, he proceeded more seriously. “Give up your dumps, girl. It will not be the worse for you that things turn out to please me. These rascals must be watched, and I can now trust none to watch them but yourself.” At this confession, her reproachful eyes were turned full and keenly upon his. He had betrayed the trust of the only being in whom he could place his own. What a commentary on his crime—on his cruel indifference to the victim of it! He saw in her eyes the meaning which her lips did not declare. “Yes, it is even so,” he said,—“and women were made for this, and they must expect it. Born to be dependants, it is enough that we employ you; and if your expectations were fewer and humbler, your chance for happiness would be far greater. Content yourself now with the conviction that you have a share in my favour, and all will go well with you. The regards of a man are not to be contracted to the frail and unsatisfying compass of one girl's heart; unless, indeed, as you all seem to fancy, that love is the sole business of a long life. Love is very well for boys and girls, but it furnishes neither the food nor the exercise for manhood. If you expect it, you live in vain. Your food must be the memories of your former luxuries. Let it satisfy you, Mary, that I loved you once.” “Never, Edward—you never loved me;—not even when my confidence in your love lost me the love of all other persons. This knowledge I have learned by knowing how I have myself loved, and by comparing my feelings with the signs of love in you. In learning to know how little I have been loved, I made the discovery of your utter incapacity to love.” “And why, pray you?” he demanded with some pique; but the girl did not answer. He saw her reluctance, and framed another question. “And why, then, after this discovery, do you still love me, and cling to me, and complain of me?” “Alas! I know not why I love you. That, indeed, is beyond me to learn. I have sought to know—I have tried to think—I have asked, but in vain, of my own mind and heart. I cling to you because I can cling nowhere else; and you have yourself said that a woman is a dependant—she must cling somewhere! As for complaint, God knows I do not come to make it—I do not wish, but I cannot help it. I weep and moan for weakness only, I believe, and I shall soon be done moaning.” “Enough—I see which way you tend now. You are foolish, Mary Clarkson, and war with your own peace. Can you never be reconciled to what is inevitable—what you can no longer avoid? Make the best of your condition—what is done can't be amended; and the sooner you show me that you can yield yourself to your fate with some grace, the more certain and soon will be the grace bestowed in turn. You are useful to me, Mary; and as women are useful to men— grown men, mark me—so do they value them. When I say `useful,' remember the word is a comprehensive one. You may be useful in love, in the promotion of fortune, revenge, ambition, hope, enterprise—a thousand things and objects, in which exercise will elevate equally your character and condition. Enough, now. You must show your usefulness to-night. I go on a business of peril, and I must go alone. But I will take you with me a part of the way, and out of sight of the encampment. To the encampment you must return, however, and with such precaution as to keep unseen. I need not counsel you any further—your talents clearly lie that way. Love is a sorry business—a sort of sickness,—perhaps the natural complaint of overgrown babies of both sexes, who should be dosed with caudle and put to bed as soon after as possible. Do you hear, child? Do you understand?” Thus substantially ended this conference—the singular terms of which, and the relation between the parties, can only be understood by remembering that sad condition of dependence in which the unhappy girl stood to her betrayer. She was hopeless of any change of fortune—she knew not where to turn—she now had no other objects to which she might presume to cling. She remembered the humbler love of John Bannister with a sigh—the roof and the affections of her father with a thrill, which carried a cold horror through all her veins. A natural instinct turned her to the only one upon whom she had any claim—a claim still indisputable, though it might be scorned or denied by him; and without being satisfied of the truth of his arguments, she was willing, as he required, to be useful, that she might not be forgotten. While the troop was preparing to cross the river, it was joined, to the surprise of every body and the chagrin of its commander, by the refractory lieutenant, Stockton. He related the events which occurred to him somewhat differently from the truth. According to his version of the story, the guard to whom he had been entrusted was attacked by a superior force, beaten, and probably slain—he himself seasonably escaping to tell the story. It was fancied by himself and friends that his narrow escape and voluntary return to his duty would lessen his offence in the eye of the chief, and probably relieve him from all the consequences threatened in his recent arrest. But the latter was too jealous of the disaffection prevailing among his men, and too confident in the beneficial influence of sternness among inferiors, to relax the measure of a hair in the exercise of his authority. He at once committed him a close prisoner, to the care of two of his most trusty adherents; and resolutely rejected the applications offered in his behalf by some of the temporizers—a class of persons of whom the Black Riders, like every other human community, had a fair proportion. The river was crossed a few miles below the Middleton Barony. A deep thicket in the forest, and on the edge of the river swamp, was chosen for their bivouac; and there, closely concealed from casual observation, the chief of the Black Riders, with his dark banditti, awaited till the approach of night, in a condition of becoming quiet. He then prepared to go forth, alone, on his expedition to the barony; and it was with some surprise, though without suspicion of the cause, that Mary Clarkson perceived, on his setting out, that he had discarded all his customary disguises, and had really been paying some little unusual 17* attention to the arts of the toilet. The black and savage beard and whiskers, as worn by the troopers generally—a massive specimen of which had fallen into the hands of Supple Jack on a previous occasion, had disappeared from his face; his sable uniform had given place to a well-fitting suit of becoming blue; and, of the costume of the troop, nothing remained but the dark belt which encircled his waist. But Mary Clarkson was not naturally a suspicious person, nor of a jealous temper; and the first observation which noticed these changes occasioned not even a surmise in relation to their object. She obeyed his intimation to follow him as he prepared to take his departure, and availing herself of the momentary diversion of such of the band as were about her at the moment, she stole away, and joined him at a little distance from the camp, where she received his instructions as to the game which he required her to play. The quiet in which Morton had left his followers did not long continue after his departure. The insubordinates availed themselves of his absence to try their strength in a bolder measure than they had before attempted; and a body of them, rising tumultuously, rushed upon the guard to whom Stockton had been given in charge, and, overawing all opposition by their superior numbers, forcibly rescued him from his bonds. Ensign Darcy was the leader of this party. He had found it no difficulty to unite them in a measure which they boldly assumed to be an act of justice, levelled at a species of tyranny to which they ought never to submit. Disaffection had spread much farther among his troop than Edward Morton imagined. Disasters had made them forgetful of ancient ties, as well as previous successes. Recently, their spoils had been few and inconsiderable, their toils constant and severe, and their dangers great. This state of things inclined them all, in a greater or less degree, to be dissatisfied; and nothing is so easy to the vulgar mind as to ascribe to the power which governs all the evils which afflict them. The leaders of the meeting availed themselves of this natural tendency with considerable art. The more ignorant and unthinking were taught to believe that their chief had mismanaged in a dozen instances, where a different course of conduct would have burdened them with spoils. He had operated on the Wateree and Santee, when the Congaree and the Saluda offered the best field for the exercise of their peculiar practices. That “frail masquer,” to whom the cold-blooded Morton had given in charge the whole espionage which he now kept upon his troop, came upon their place of secret consultation at a moment auspicious enough for the objects of her watch. They had—that is, such of the band (and this involved a majority) as were disposed to rebel against their present leader— assembled in a little green dell, beside a rivulet which passed from the highlands of the forest into the swamp. Here they had kindled a small fire, enough to give light to their deliberations—had lighted their pipes, and from their canteens were seasoning their deliberations with the requisite degree and kind of spirit. With that carelessness of all precautions which is apt to follow any decisive departure from the usual restraints of authority, they had neglected to place sentries around their place of conference, who might report the approach of any hostile footstep,—or, if these had been placed at the beginning, they had been seduced by the temptations of the debate and the drink to leave their stations and take their seats along with their comrades. Mary Clarkson was thus enabled to steal within easy hearing of all their deliberations. Stockton, with exemplary forbearance and a reserve that was meant to be dignified, did not take much part in the proceedings. Ensign Darcy, however, was faithful to his old professions, and was the principal speaker. He it was who could best declare what, in particular, had been the omissions of the chief; and by what mistakes he had led the troop from point to point, giving them no rest, little food, and harassing them with constant dangers and alarms. The extent of his information surprised the faithful listener, and informed her also of some matters which she certainly did not expect to hear. Darcy was supported chiefly by the huge fellow already known by the name of Barton—the same person who had led the insubordinates in Muggs' cabin, when Edward Morton, at the last moment, sprang up to the rescue of his kinsman. This ruffian, whose violence then had offered opposition to his leader, and could only be suppressed by the show of an equal violence on the part of the latter, had never been entirely satisfied with himself since that occasion. He was one of those humble-minded persons of whom the world is so full, who are always asking what their neighbours think of them; and being a sort of braggart and bully, he was annoyed by a consciousness of having lost some portion of the esteem of his comrades by the comparatively easy submission which he then rendered to his leader. This idea haunted him, and he burned for some opportunity to restore himself in their wonted regards. Darcy discovered this, and worked upon the fool's frailty to such a degree, that he was persuaded to take the lead in the work of mutiny, and to address his specious arguments to those doubtful persons of the gang whom the fox-like properties of the ensign would never have suffered him directly to approach. Their modes of convincing the rest were easy enough, since their arguments were plausible, if not true, and there was some foundation for many of the objections urged against their present commander. “Here, for example,” said Darcy; “here he comes to play the lover at Middleton Place. He dodges about the young woman when it suits him; and either we follow him here, and hang about to keep the rebels from his skirts, or he leaves us where we neither hear nor see any thing of him for weeks. Meanwhile, we can do nothing—we dare not to move without him; and if we do any creditable thing, what's the consequence? Lieutenant Stockton there can tell you. He's knocked over like a bullock, and arrested—is attacked by the rebels, makes a narrow escape, comes back like a good soldier, and is put under arrest again, as if no punishment was enough for showing the spirit of a man.” “Ah, yes, that wa'nt right of the captain;” said one, with a conclusive shake of the head. “Yes, and all that jist after the lieutenant had been busy for five days, through storm and rain, looking after him only,” said another. “It's a God's truth, for sartin—the captain's a mighty changed man now-a-days,” said a third. “He aint the same person, that's cl'ar,” was the conviction of a fourth; and so on through the tale. “And who's going to stand it?” cried the fellow Barton, in a voice of thunder, shivering the pipe in his hand by a stroke upon the earth that startled more than one of the doubtful. “I'll tell you what, men—there's no use to beat about the bush when the thing can be made plain to every man's onderstanding. Here it is, We're in a mighty bad fix at present, any how; and the chance is a great deal worse, so long as we stand here. Here, the whigs are quite too thick for us to deal with. It's either, we must go up to the mountains or get down towards the seaboard. I'm told there's good pickings any way. But here we've mighty nigh cleaned the crib;—there's precious little left. What's to keep us here, I can't see; but it's easy to see what keeps Captain Morton here. He's after this gal of Middleton's; and he'll stay and peep, and dodge, and come and go, until he gits his own neck in the halter, and may-be our'n too. Now, if you're of my mind, we'll leave him to his gal and all he can get by her, and take horse this very night, and find our way along the Saludah, up to Ninety-Six. That's my notion; and as a beginning, I'm willing to say, for the first, let Harry Stockton be our captain from the jump.” “Softly, softly, Barton,” said the more wily Darcy; “that can hardly be, unless you mean to put the garrison of Ninety-Six at defiance also. You'll find it no easy matter to show a king's commission for the lieutenant; and it'll be something worse if Ned Morton faces you just at the moment when Balfour, or Rawdon, or Stuart, or Cruger, has you under examination. No, no! There's no way of doing the thing, unless you can show that Ned Morton's a dead man or a traitor. Now, then, which shall it be?” “Both!” roared Barton. “I'm for the dead man first. We can go in a body and see for ourselves that he's done up for this world, and we can go in the same body to Cruger at Ninety-Six and show that we want a captain, and can't find a better man than Harry Stockton.” “But he aint dead,” said one of the more simple of the tribe. “Who says he aint?” growled the ruffian Barton— “when I say he is? He's dead,—dead as a door nail; and we'll prove it before we go to Cruger. Do you suppose I'm going with a lie in my mouth? We must make true what we mean to say.” “You're right, Barton,” quietly continued Darcy; “but perhaps 'twould be well, men, to let you know some things more. Now, you must know that Middleton Place has been let alone, almost the only house, since the beginning of the war. Old Middleton was a mighty great favourite among the people of all these parts when he was living; and Lord Cornwallis hearing that, he gave orders not to do any harm to it or the people living there. Well, as they were women only, and had neither father, brother nor son engaged in the war, there was no provocation to molest them; and so things stand there as quietly as they did in `seventy-five.' In that house, men, there's more good old stamped plate than you'll find in half the country. I reckon you may get barrels of it, yet not have room for all. Well, there's the jewels of the women—it's a guess of mine only, but I reckon a safe one, when I say that I have no doubt you'll find jewels of Flora Middleton enough to help every man of us to the West Indies, and for six months after. Now, it's a question whether we let the captain carry off this girl with all her jewels, or whether we come in for a share. It's my notion it's that he's aiming at. He don't care a fig what becomes of us if he can carry off this plunder, and this is the secret of all his doings. I know he's half mad after the girl, and will have her, though he takes her with his claws. I move that we have a hand in the business. It's but to steal up to Briar Park, get round the place, sound a rebel alarm, and give him a shot while he's running. After that, the work's easy. We can then pass off upon the women as a rebel troop, and empty the closets at our leisure.” The temptations of this counsel were exceeding great. It was received without a dissenting voice, though there were sundry doubts yet to be satisfied among the more prudent or the more timid. “But the boy—that strange boy, Henry. He's with him. What's to be done with him?” Mary Clarkson had been a breathless listener during the whole of this conference. Her emotions were new and indescribable. Heretofore, strange to say, she had never entertained the idea, for a single instant, of Edward Morton loving another woman. She had never, during the marauding life of danger which he pursued, beheld him in any situation which might awaken her female fears. Now, the unreserved communication and bold assertion of Darcy, awakened a novel emotion of pain within her heart, and a new train of reflection in her mind. “This, then,” she mused to herself, as she recollected the conversation that morning with her seducer, —“this, then, is the bird that he spoke of—the sweet singing bird in that gloomy castle, which he determined to release. Strange that I had no fear, no thought of this! But he cannot love her—No! no! he has no such nature. It is not possible for him to feel as I have felt.” She strove to listen again, but she heard little more. Her mind had formed a vague impression of his danger, but it was associated with images equally vague in form, but far more impressive in shadow, of the fair woman whose beauty and whose wealth were alike supposed to be potential over the rugged chief of that fierce banditti. She began to think, for the first time, that there was some reason in the complainings of the troop; but their suggestion to murder the criminal, revived in all its force, if not her old passion, at least her habitual feeling of dependence upon him. The idea of losing for ever the one who, of all the world, she could now seek, was one calculated to awaken all her most oppressive fears; and with a strong effort at composure, she now bent all her attention to ascertain what were the precise means by which they proposed to effect their objects. The details of Darcy enlightened her, and she was about to rise from her lowly position and hiding place, and steal away to Briar Place, in order to awaken Morton to his danger, when the inquiry touching her own fate commanded her attention. “What of the boy, Henry—what shall be done with him? I'm thinking he's the one that reports every thing to the captain? What shall we do with him?” “Cut his throat, to be sure. He is no use to any of us; and if we silence the captain, we must do for him also. I reckon they're together now.” “The getting rid of the boy is a small matter,” said Darcy; “let's settle about the principal first, and the rest is easily managed. We must set about this affair seriously—there must be no traitors. We must swear by knife, bullet, tree and halter—the old oath!—there must be blood on it! Whose blood shall it be?” “Mine!” exclaimed Barton, as he thrust forth his brawny arm to the stroke and drew up the sleeve. Mary Clarkson was still too much of a woman to wait and witness the horrid ceremonial by which they bound themselves to one another; but she could hear the smooth, silvery voice of Darcy, while she stole away on noiseless feet, as he severally administered the oath, upon the gashed arm of the confederate, to each of the conspirators. “Swear!” And the single response of the first ruffian, as he pledged himself, struck terror to her heart and gave fleetness to her footsteps. “By knife, cord, tree and bullet, I swear to be true to you my brothers in this business;—if I fail or betray you, then let knife, cord, tree or bullet do its work!— I swear!” The terrible sounds pursued her as she fled; but even then she forgot not what she had heard before, of that “sweet singing bird, in that gloomy cage,” to both of which she was now approaching with an equal sentiment of curiosity and terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 18 CHAPTER XVII. SOME LOVE PASSAGES AT BRIAR PARK. Meanwhile, the chief of the Black Riders pursued his noiseless way to the scene of his projected operations. Familiar with the neighbourhood, it was not a difficult matter for him to make his progress with sufficient readiness through the gloomy forests. The route had been often trodden by him before—often, indeed, when the fair Flora Middleton little dreamed of the proximity of her dangerous lover—often, when not a star in the sky smiled in encouragement upon his purposes. The stars were smiling now—the night was without a cloud, unless it were a few of those light, fleecy, transparent robes, which the rising moon seems to fling out from her person, and which float about her pathway in tributary beauty; and she, herself, the maiden queen, making her stately progress through her worshipping dominions, rose with serene aspect and pure splendour, shooting her silver arrows on every side into the thicket, which they sprinkled, as they flew, with sweet, transparent droppings, of the same glimmering beauty with her own. The winds were soft or sleeping. The sacred stillness of the sabbath prevailed in the air and over the earth, save when some nightbird flapped a drowsy wing among the branches which overhung its nest, or, with sudden scream, shrunk from the slanting shafts of light now fast falling through the forests. Were these aspects propitious to the purposes of the outlaw? Were those smiles for him only? No! While he pursued the darker passages of the woods, studiously concealing his person from the light, other and nobler spirits were abroad enjoying it. Love, of another sort than his, was no less busy; and, attended by whatever success, with a spirit far more worthy of the gentler influences which prevailed equally above the path of both. The outlaw reached the grounds of the ancient barony. He had almost followed the course of the river, and he now stood upon its banks. His path lay through an old field, now abandoned, which was partly overgrown by the lob-lolly, or short-leaf pine. The absence of undergrowth made his progress easy. He soon found himself beside the solemn grove which had grown up, from immemorial time, in hallowed security around the vaulted mansion in which slept the remains of the venerable cassique. He penetrated the sacred enclosure, and, as he had frequently done before, examined the entrance of the tomb, which he found as easy as usual. The dead in the wilderness need no locks or bolts for their security. There are no resurrectionists there to annoy them. Here he did not long remain. Pressing forward, he approached the park and grounds lying more immediately about the mansion; but here a new occasion for caution presented itself. He found soldiers on duty—sentinels put at proper distances; and, fastened to the swinging limbs of half a dozen trees, as many dragoon horses. He changed his course and proceeded on another route, with the hope to approach the dwelling without observation; but here again the path was guarded. The watch seemed a strict one. The sentinels were regular, and their responses so timed, as to leave him no prospect of passing through the intervals of their rounds. Yet, even if this had been allowed him, what good could be effected by it? He could not hope to make himself known to the person he sought. He could only hope to see by whom she was attended. What guest did she entertain? To know this, his curiosity became intense. He would probably have risked something to have attained this knowledge; but, under the close watch which environed the habitation, endeavour would have been utterly hopeless. This conviction drove him back to the tomb, with curses on his lips and fury in his heart. He was not one of those men who had known much, or had learned to endure any disappointment; and his anger and anxiety grew almost to fever when, after successive and frequent attempts to find an open passage to the house, he was compelled to give up the prospect in despair. The guests seemed in no hurry to withdraw —the lights in the dwelling were bright and numerous. He fancied, more than once, as he continued his survey, that he could hear the tones of Flora's harpsichord, as the winds brought the sounds in the required direction. The twin instincts of hate and jealousy informed him who was the guest of the maiden. Who could it be but Clarence Conway—that kinsman who seemed born to be his bane—to whom he ascribed the loss of property and position; beneath whose superior virtue his spirit quailed, and to a baseless jealousy of whom might in truth be ascribed much of the unhappy and dishonourable practices which, so far, he had almost fruitlessly pursued. His was the jealousy rather of hate than love. Perhaps such a passion as the latter, according to the opinion of Mary Clarkson, could not fill the bosom of one so utterly selfish as Edward Morton. But he had his desires, and the denial of his object—which, to himself, he dignified with the name of love—was quite enough to provoke his wrath to phrenzy. “All, all, has he robbed me of,” he muttered through his closed teeth:—“The love of parents, the regards of friends, the attachment of inferiors, the wealth of kindred and the love of woman. He drew from me the smiles of my father—the playmate from my side; the rude woodman, whose blind but faithful attachment was that of the hound, abandoned me to cling to him; and now!—but I am not sure of this! He is not sure! Flora Middleton has said nothing yet to justify his presumption, and I have sown some bitter seeds of doubt in her soul, which, if she be like the rest of her sex, and if that devil, or saint, that serves him, do not root up by some miraculous interposition, will yet bring forth a far different fruit from any which he now hopes to taste. Let her but be shy and haughty—let him but show himself sensitive and indignant, and all will be done. This meeting will prove nothing, and time gained now is, to me, every thing. In another week, and I ask no farther help from fortune. If I win her not by fair word, I win her by bold deeds; and then I brush the clay of the Congaree for ever from my feet! The waves of the sea shall separate me for ever from the doubts and the dangers, numerous and troublesome, which are increasing around me. This silly girl, too, whom no scorn can drive from my side—I shall then, and then only, be fairly rid of her!” He threw himself on the stone coping which surrounded the vault, and surrendered himself up to the bitter meditations which a reference to the past life necessarily awakens in every guilty bosom. These, we care not to pursue; but, with the reader's permission, will proceed, without heeding those obstructions which drove the Chief of the Black Riders to his lurking place, to the mansion of the lovely woman, whose fortunes, though we have not yet beheld her person, should already have awakened some interest in our regard. The instinct of hate in the bosom of Edward Morton had informed him rightly. The guest of Flora Middleton was his hated kinsman. He had reached the barony that very evening, and had met with that reception from the inmates of Briar Park, which they were accustomed to show to the gentlemen of all parties in that time of suspicion and cautious policy. The grandmother was kind and good-natured as ever; but Clarence saw or fancied that he saw in Flora an air of haughty indifference, which her eyes sometimes exchanged for one of a yet more decided feeling. Could it be anger that flashed at moments from beneath the long dark eye-lashes of that high-browed beauty? Was it indignation that gave that curl to her rich and rosy 18* lips;—and made her tones, always sweet as a final strain of music, now sharp, sudden, and almost stern? The eyes of Clarence looked more than once the inquiry which he knew not how to make in any other way; but only once did the dark-blue orbs of Flora encounter his for a prolonged moment; and then he thought that their expression was again changed to one of sorrow. After that, she resolutely evaded his glance; and the time, for an hour after his arrival, was passed by him in a state of doubtful solicitude, and by Flora, as he could not help thinking, under a feeling of restraint and excessive circumspection, which was new to both of them, and painful in the last degree to him. All the freedoms of their old intercourse had given way to cold, stiff formalities; and, in place of “Flora” from his lips, and “Clarence” from hers, the forms of address became as rigid and ceremonious between them as the most punctilious Puritan of that day could insist upon. Flora Middleton was rather remarkable than beautiful. She was a noble specimen of the Anglo Saxon. Glowing with health, but softened by grace; warmed by love, yet not obtrusive in her earnestness. Of a temper quick, energetic, and decisive; yet too proud to deal in the language either of anger or complaint—too delicate in her own sensibilities to outrage, by impudent haste, the feelings of others. Living at a time, and in a region, where life was full of serious purposes and continual trials, she was superior to those small tastes and petty employments, which dishonour too greatly the understandings of her sex, and diminish dreadfully its importance to man and to society. Her thoughts were neither too nice for, nor too superior to, the business and the events of the time. She belonged to that wonderful race of Carolina women, above all praise, who could minister, with equal propriety and success, at those altars for which their fathers, and husbands, and brothers fought—who could tend the wounded, nurse the sick, cheer the dispirited, arm the warrior for the field—nay, sometimes lift spear and sword in sudden emergency, and make desperate battle, in compliance with the requisitions of the soul, nerved by tenderness, and love, and serious duty, to the most masculine exertions—utterly forgetful of those effeminacies of the sex, which are partly due to organization and partly to the arbitrary, and, too frequently, injurious laws of society. In such circumstances as characterized the time of which we write, women as well as men, became superior to affectations of every kind. The ordinary occupations of life were too grave to admit of them. The mind threw off its petty humours with disdain, and where it did not, the disdain of all other minds was sure to attend it. Flora never knew affectations—she was no fine lady—had no humours—no vegetable life; but went on vigorously enjoying time in the only way, by properly employing it. She had her tastes, and might be considered by some persons as rather fastidious in them—but this fastidiousness was nothing more than method. Her love of order was one of her domestie virtues. But, though singularly methodical for her sex, she had no hum-drum notions; and, in society, would have been the last to be suspected of being very regular in any of her habits. Her animation was remarkable—her playful humour—which took no exceptions to unrestraint—found no fault with the small follies of one's neighbour; yet never trespassed beyond the legitimate bounds of amusement. That she showed none of this animation—this humour —on the present occasion, was one of the chief sources of Clarence Conway's disquietude. Restraint was so remarkable in the case of one, whose frank, voluntary spirit was always ready with its music, that he conjured up the most contradictory notions to account for it. “Are you sick?” he asked; “do you feel unwell?” was one of his inquiries, as his disquiet took a new form of apprehension. “Sick—no! what makes you fancy such a thing, Colonel Conway? Do I look so?” “No; but you seem dull—not in spirits—something must have happened—” “Perhaps something has happened, cousin Clarence:” —this was the first phrase of kindness which reminded Clarence of old times. He fancied she began to soften. “Cousin Clarence,” was one of the familiar forms of address which had been adopted by the maiden some years previously, when, mere children, they first grew intimate together. “But I am not sick,” she continued, “and still less ought you to consider me dull. Such an opinion, Clarence, would annoy many a fair damsel of my acquaintance. “But, on that head, Flora, you are too secure to suffer it to annoy you.” “Perhaps I am—but you have certainly lost the knack of saying fine things. The swamps have impaired your politeness. That last phrase has not bettered your speech, since I am at liberty to take it either as a reproach or a compliment.” “Can there be a doubt which?—As a compliment surely. But let me have occasion for another, the meaning of which shall be less liable to misconstruction. Let me lead you to the harpsichord.” “Excuse me—not to-night, Clarence;” and her present reply was made with recovered rigidity of manner. “If not to-night, Flora, I know not when I shall hear you again—perhaps not for months—perhaps, never!— I go to Ninety-Six to-morrow.” Her manner softened as she replied;— “Ah! do you, Clarence;—and there, at present, lies the whole brunt of the war. I should like to play for you, Clarence—but I cannot. You must be content with music of drum and trumpet for a while.” “Why, Flora—you never refused me before?” “True—but—” “But, one piece?” “Do not ask me again. I cannot—I will not play for you to-night—nay, do not interrupt me, Clarence— my harpsichord is in tune—and I am not seeking for apologies. I tell you I will not play for you to-night, and, perhaps, I will never play for you again.” The young colonel of cavalry was astounded. “Flora—Flora Middleton!” was his involuntary exclamation. The venerable grandmother echoed it, though her tones were those of exhortation, not of surprise. “Flora—Flora, my child—what would you do?” she continued with rebuking voice and warning finger. “Nay mother,” said the maiden assuringly—“let me have my own way in this. I like frankness, and if Clarence be what he always seemed, and we always believed him—he will like it too. I am a country girl, and may be permitted a little of the simplicity—you call it bluntness, perhaps—which is natural to one.” “Flora, what can be the meaning of this?” demanded the lover with unaffected earnestness and astonishment. “In what have I offended you? For there is some such meaning in your words.” The maiden looked to her grandmother, but did not answer; and Conway, though greatly excited, could readily perceive that she laboured under feelings which evidently tried her confidence in herself, and tested all her strength. A deep suffusion overspread her cheek, the meaning of which, under other circumstances, he might have construed favourably to his suit. Meanwhile, the old lady nodded her head with a look of mixed meaning, which one, better read in the movements of her mind, would have found to signify—“Go through with what you have begun, since you have already gone so far. You cannot halt now.” So indeed did it seem to be understood by the maiden; for she instantly recovered herself and continued:— “Give me your arm, Clarence, and I will explain all. I am afraid I have overtasked myself, but the orphan, Clarence Conway, must assert her own rights and character, though it may somewhat impair, in the estimation of the stronger sex, her pretensions to feminine delicacy.” “You speak in mysteries, Flora,” was the answer of the lover;—“surely the orphan has no wrong to fear at my hands—and what rights of Flora Middleton are there, disputed or denied by me, which it becomes her to assert with so much solemnity, and at such a fearful risk?” “Come with me, and you shall know all.” She took his arm, and motioning her head expressively to her grandmother, led the way to the spacious portico, half embowered by gadding vines—already wanton with a thousand flowers of the budding season —which formed the high and imposing entrance to the ancient dwelling. The spot was one well chosen for the secrets of young lovers—a home of buds, and blossoms, and the hallowing moonlight:—quiet above in the sky—quiet on the earth;—a scene such as prompts the mind to dream that there may be griefs and strifes at a distance—rumours of war and bloodshed in barbarian lands, and of tempests that will never trouble ours. Clarence paused as they emerged into the sweet natural shadows of the spot. “How have I dreamed of these scenes, Flora—this spot—these flowers, and these only! My heart has scarcely forgotten the situation of a single bud or leaf. All appears now as I fancy it nightly in our long rides and longer watches in the swamp.” She answered with a sigh:— “Can war permit of this romance, Clarence? Can it be possible that he who thinks of blood, and battle, and the near neighbourhood of the foe, has yet a thought to spare to ladies' bowers, vines, blossoms and such woman fancies as make up the pleasures of her listless moods, and furnish, in these times, her only, and, perhaps, her best society.” “I think of them as tributary to her only, Flora. Perhaps I should not have thought of these, but that you were also in my thoughts.” “No more, Clarence; and you remind me of the explanation which I have to make—and to demand. Bear with me for a moment—it calls for all my resolution.” She seated herself upon a bench beneath the vines, and motioned him to a place beside her. After a brief delay—a tribute to the weakness of her sex—she began as follows:— “Clarence Conway, before I saw you to-night, I had resolved henceforward to regard and treat you as the most indifferent stranger that ever challenged the hospitality of my father's dwelling. But I have not been able to keep my resolution. Your coming to-night, reminds me so much of old times, when I had every reason to respect—why should I not say it?—to like you, Clarence, that I feel unwilling to put you off as a stranger, without making such explanations as will justify me in this course. Briefly then, Clarence Conway, some things have reached my ears, as if spoken by you, and of me—such things as a vain young man might be supposed likely to say of any young woman who has suffered him to think that she had thoughts for nothing beside himself. I will not tell you, Clarence, that I believed all this.—I could not dare—I did not wish to believe it;—but, I thought it not impossible that you had spoken of me, perhaps too familiarly;—without contemplating the injury you might do me. Now, if you know any thing of a maiden's heart, Clarence Conway—nay, if you knew any thing of mine, you would readily imagine what I must have felt on hearing this. The burning blushes on my cheeks now—painfully as I feel them—were as nothing to the galling sting of the moment when I heard this story. “But you did not believe it, Flora!” “Believe it, no!—not all, at least—” “None! none!” repeated the youth, with stern emphasis, as he laid his hand upon her arm, and looked her in the face with such an expression as falsehood never yet could assume. “That I should speak this of you, and that you should believe it. Flora Middleton, are things which I should have fancied equally impossible! Need I say that it is all false—thoroughly false —that your name has never passed my lips but with feelings of the profoundest reverence—that—but I blush too, at the seeming necessity of saying all this, and saying it to you—I thought—I could have hoped, Flora Middleton, that you, at least, knew me better than to doubt. The necessity of this explanation, next to the sorrow of having given pain to you, is the keenest pang which you could make me suffer.” “Be not angry, Clarence,” she said gently—“remember what society exacts of my sex—remember how much of our position depends upon the breath of man;—our tyrant too often—always our sole judge while we dwell upon the earth. His whisper of power over us, is our death;—the death of our pride—of that exclusiveness of which he, himself, is perhaps, the most jealous being; and whether the tale of his freedom be true or not—how great is our peril—how keen the sting —how formidable the sarcasm. I say this to account for the promptness of my resentment. I tell you, Clarence Conway, that a woman of my frank nature, is compelled to be resentful, if she would subdue the slanderer to silence. Slander is of such mushroom growth, yet spreads over so large a surface, that it is needful at once to check the first surmises, and doubts, and insinuations with which it begins its fungous, but poisonous existence. My feeling on this subject—my keen jealousy of my own position—a jealousy the more natural, as, from the frankness of my disposition, I am frequently liable to be misunderstood, has possibly led me to do you injustice. Even when this reached my ears, I did not believe it altogether. I thought it not improbable, however, that you had spoken of me among your friends, and—” “Forgive me that I interrupt you, Flora. I feel too much pain at what you say—too much annoyance—to suffer you to go on. Let me finish my assurances. I shall employ but few words, and they shall be final, or—nothing! I have no friends to whom I should ever speak a falsehood of any kind—none to whom I would ever utter, with unbecoming familiarity, the name of Flora Middleton. If I have spoken of you in the hearing of others, it has been very seldom; only, perhaps, when it seemed needful for me to do so—perhaps never more than once; and then never in disparagement of that modesty which is the noblest characteristic of your sex. But!—” He paused! He was reminded at this moment of the late conference which he had with Edward Conway. In that conference he had certainly asserted a superior right, over his kinsman, to approach Flora Middleton with love. This assertion, however, only contemplated the relative position of the brothers, one to the other; and was accompanied by an express disclaimer, on the part of Clarence, of any influence over the maiden herself; but the recollection of this circumstance increased the difficulties in the way of an explanation, unless by the adoption of a single and very simple—but a very direct course—which is always apt to be regarded as one of great peril by all youthful lovers. Clarence Conway was one of those men who know only the Alexandrine method of getting through the knots of the moral Gordius. “I have spoken of you, Flora—nay, I have spoken of you, and in reference to the most delicate subject in the history of a woman's heart. Thus far I make my confession, and will forbear with your permission saying more—saying what I mean to say—until I have craved of you the name of him who has thus ventured to defame me.” “I cannot tell you, Clarence.” “Cannot, Flora?—Cannot!—” “Will not, is what I should say, perhaps; but I have used those words once already, to-night, when I felt that they must give you pain; and I would have forborne their use a second time. I can, certainly, tell you from whom I heard these things, but I will not.” “And why not, Flora? Would you screen the slanderer?” “Yes!—For a very simple reason;—I would not have you fight him, Clarence.—” “Enough, Flora, that I know the man. None could be so base but the person whom you know as Edward Conway, but whom I know—” He paused—he could not make the revelation. VOL. I. 19 “Ha! How! What know you of Edward Conway!” “That which makes me blush to believe that he is my father's son. But my knowledge is such, Flora, that I will not tell it you. It differs from yours in this respect, that, unhappily, it is true—all true—terribly true! Know, then, that, to him—to Edward Conway— long ago, did I declare what I once already presumed to declare to you—that I loved you—” “Let me not hear you, Clarence,” said the maiden timidly, rising as she spoke. But, he took her hand, and with a gentle pressure restored her to her seat beside him. “I must. It is now necessary for my exculpation. Before he saw you, he knew that I loved you, and was the profligate confederate of my unsuspecting affections. He betrayed them. He sought you thenceforward with love himself. Words of anger—blows, almost— followed between us; and though we did not actually reach that issue, yet suspicion, and jealousy, and hate, are now the terms on which we stand to each other. He poured this cursed falsehood into your ears, I have reason to think, but ten days ago. Within the same space of time I have saved his life. To him, only, have I spoken of you in terms liable to misrepresentation. I did not speak of having claims upon you, Flora, but upon him;—I charged him with treachery to my trust, though I did not then dream that he had been the doubly-dyed traitor that I have since found him.” “Let us return to the parlour, Clarence.” “No, Flora,” said the youth, with mild and mournful accents. “No, Flora Middleton, let our understanding be final. To-morrow I go to Ninety-Six, and God knows what fate awaits me there. You, perhaps, can assist in determining it, by the response which you make to-night. I wrote you by John Bannister, Flora, —I know that you received that letter,—yet you sent me no answer.” “Let me confess, also, Clarence:—But three days before I received your letter, I was told of this.” “Ha! Has the reptile been so long at his web?” exclaimed the youth—“But I will crush him in it yet.” “Beware! Oh! Clarence Conway, beware of what you say. Beware of rash vows and rash performances. Do you forget that the man of whom you speak is your brother—the son of your father?” “Why should I remember that which he has himself forgotten;—nay, which he repudiates with bitterest curses, and which the black deeds of his wretched life, —of which now you know nothing,—has repudiated more effectually than all. But I would not speak of him now, Flora. I would, if possible, exclude all bitterness from my thought—as, in speaking to you, I would exclude it from my lips. Hear me, Flora. You know the service I am sent upon. You can imagine some of its dangers. The employment now before me is particularly so. The strife along the Saluda now is one of no ordinary character. It is a strife between brothers, all of whom have learned to hate as I do, and to seek to destroy with an appetite of far greater anxiety. The terms between whig and tory, now, are death only. No quarter is demanded—none is given. Horrible, horrible!—but I know it all. “The final issue is at hand, and victory is almost in our grasp. The fury of the tories increases with their despair. They feel that they must fly the country, and they are accordingly drenching it with blood. I speak to you, therefore, with the solemnity of one who may never see you more. But if I do, Flora, dear Flora— if I survive this bloody campaign, may I hope that then —these doubts all dispersed, these slanders disproven— you will look on me with favour; you will smile—you will be mine; mine only—all mine!” The tremors of the soft white hand which he grasped within his own assured the lover of the emotion in her breast. Her bosom heaved for an instant, but she was spared the necessity of making that answer, which, whether it be “no” or “yes,” is equally difficult for any young damsel's utterance. A signal whistle sounded from without;—once—twice—thrice;—a bustle was heard among the few dragoons who were stationed by the prudent commander about the premises; and, a moment after, the subdued tones of the faithful Supple Jack apprised his captain that danger was at hand. “Speak!—speak to me, Flora, ere I leave you—ere I leave you, perhaps, for ever! Speak to me!—tell me that I have not prayed and worshipped in vain. Send me not forth, doubtful or hopeless. If it be—” Sweet, indeed, to his heart, were the tremulous beatings which he distinctly heard of hers. They said all that her lips refused to say. Yet never was heart more ready to respond in the affirmative—never were lips more willing to declare themselves. One reflection alone determined her not to do so. It was a feeling of feminine delicacy that prompted her, for the time, to withhold the confession of feminine weakness. “What!”—such was the reflection as it passed through her mind,—“bring him to these shades to hear such a confession! Impossible! What will he think of me? No! no!—not to-night. Not here, at least!” She was still silent, but her agitation evidently increased; yet not more than that of her lover. The summons of the faithful scout was again repeated. The circumstances admitted of no delay. “Oh, speak to me, dearest Flora. Surely you cannot need any new knowledge of what I am, or of the love I bear you.” “No, no! But, Clarence, I will not answer you to-night—not now—not here!” The last word was spoken with uncommon energy, as she moved to retire. “Leave me not thus—but one word—one! Say, at least, that I may hope.” Her lips were inflexible; but if ever hand yet spoke the meaning of its kindred heart, then did the soft, shrinking hand which he grasped nervously in his own, declare the meaning of hers. It said “hope on—love on!” as plainly as maiden finger ever said it yet; and this was all—and, perhaps, enough, as a first answer to a young beginner—which she then vouchsafed him, as she glided into the apartment. In the next moment the faithful Supple Jack, clearing, at a single bound, the height from the terrace to the upper balcony, in which the interview had taken place, breathed into the half-oblivious senses of his commander the hurried words— “The British—the British are upon us! We have not a moment to lose!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">19* CHAPTER XVIII. A CONFERENCE IN THE TOME. These words at once awoke the soldier to activity. Clarence Conway was not the man to become subdued by “amaryllis in the shade,” nor meshed, fly-like, in the “tangles of any Næra's hair.” A new mood possessed him with the communication of his faithful scout, who, by the way, also performed the duties of his lieutenant. “Get your men instantly to horse, Jack Bannister, and send them forward on the back track to the river;” was the prompt command of the superior. “Done a'ready, colonel,” was the respectful answer. “Good;—and, now, for your report.” The examination which followed was brief, rapid, and comprehensive. Though fond of long speeches usually, Jack Bannister was yet the model of a man of business. He could confine himself, when needful, to the very letter. “From whence came the enemy?—above or below?” “Below, sir.” “What force do your scouts report to you?” “Large!—I reckon it's Rawdon's whole strength; but the advance only is at hand.” “Rawdon, ha! He goes then to the relief of `Ninety-Six.' I trust he goes too late. But our business is scarce with him. What cavalry has he? Did you learn that?” “It's mighty small, I'm thinking; but we can't hear for sartin. It's had a monstrous bad cutting up, you know, at Orangeburg, and don't count more, I reckon, than sixty men, all told. That's the whole force of Coffin, I know.” “We must manage that, then! It's the only mode in which we can annoy Rawdon and baffle his objects. Between `Briar Park' and `Ninety-Six' we should surely pick up all of his flock,—and must! Are the scouts in? All?” “All but Finley—I'm dub'ous he's cut off below. They've caught him napping, I reckon.” “If so, he has paid, before this, the penalty of his nap. We must be careful not to incur like penalties. We have nothing to do but to draw off quietly from Briar Park, taking the back track by the river, and plant ourselves in waiting a few miles above. There are a dozen places along the road where we can bring them into a neat ambush, which will enable us to empty their saddles. What do the lower scouts say of their order of march?” “Precious little! They had to run for it—Coffin's cavalry scouring pretty considerably ahead. But they keep up a mighty quick step. It's a forced march, and the cavalry is half a mile or more in advance.” “They march without beat of drum?” “Or blast of bugle;—so quiet you can hardly hear the clatter of a sabre. Nothing but the heavy tread of their feet.” “Enough. As you have sent the troop forward, let your scouts file off quietly after them. Keep close along the river, and let them all be in saddle when I reach them at the end of the Causey. Rawdon will probably make the `Barony' his place of rest to-night. He must have marched fifty miles since last midnight. Pity we had not known of this! That fellow, Finley— he was a sharp fellow, too,—but no matter! Go you now, Bannister. Have my horse in readiness by the old vault; and let your scouts, in filing off, dismount and lead their horses, that there may be no unnecessary clatter of hoofs. Away, now—I will but say farewell to Mrs. Middleton and Flora.” “Tell 'em good-by for me, too, colonel, if you please; for they've always been mighty genteel in the way they've behaved to me, and I like to be civil.” Clarence promised him, and the excellent fellow disappeared, glad to serve the person whom he most affectionately loved. Clarence then proceeded to the apartment in which the ladies were sitting; and suffering under the natural excitement produced by intelligence, always so startling in those days, as the approach of a British army. Brief words at parting were allowed to the lovers; and whether Mrs. Middleton conjectured, or had been told by Flora of what had taken place between them, the old lady was civil enough to leave the couple together without the restraint of her maternal presence. Preliminaries, at such moments, among sensible people are usually dispeused with. “You will not answer me, Flora?” “Spare me, Clarence—not now.” “Now, now!—think, dearest Flora, of the circumstances under which I leave you;—the force that drives me from your presence! Remember the danger that follows my footsteps, and the dangers which I am bound to seek. I may never again behold you—may lose, in the skirmish of the dawn—the hope, the fear, the thousand dreams and anxieties which now possess and alternately afflict and delight my heart. Let me not go forth trembling with this doubt. But one word—one only— which shall fill my bosom with new spirit, strength and courage.—Speak, dearest Flora—but a single word!” “Ah, Clarence, urge me not! What I should say, might have a very different effect upon you;—might subdue your spirit, disarm your strength;—make your heart to waver in its courage;—might—” “Enough! enough!—I ask for no other answer!” he exclaimed with bright eyes and a bounding spirit.— “Nothing could do that, but the fear of losing a treasure suddenly won and so precious, over all things, in my sight. But I trust that this sweet conviction, dear Flora, will have no such effect upon my spirit. If, before, I fought only for my country—I now fight for love and country!—and the double cause should occasion double courage. Farewell—farewell!—God be with you, and his angels watch over you, as fondly, as faithfully, and with more ability to serve you, than your own Clarence. —Farewell, farewell!” Hastily seizing her hand, he carried it to his lips with a fervent pressure; then, elastic with new emotions of delight, that made him heedless and thoughtless of the danger, he hurried downwards into the court-yard below. The area lay in utter silence. The scouts had gone, the sentinels withdrawn; and, with a single glance up to the apartment where he had left the lady of his love, the youthful partisan took his way after his lieutenant. Let us only follow him so far as to look after other agents in our narrative, who lie upon his route, and whom we may no longer leave unnoticed. Long and wearisome, indeed, had been the hour of anxious watch which the Chief of the Black Riders had maintained over the barony, in his gloomy hiding place. Twenty times, in that period, had he emerged from the tomb, and advanced towards the dwelling of the living. But his course was bounded by the military restraints which the timely prudence of Conway, and the watchfulness of Bannister, had set around the mansion. Vainly, from the cover of this or that friendly tree, did his eyes strain to pierce the misty intervals, and penetrate the apartment, whose gay lights and occasional shadows were all that were distinguishable. Disappointed each time, he returned to his place of concealment, with increasing chagrin; plunging, in sheer desperation, down into its awful and dark recesses, which to him presented no aspects either of awe or darkness. At length, however, the sound of a movement near the mansion awakened in him a hope that his tedious watch would shortly end. Slight though the noises were, under the cautious management of Bannister—the calling in of the sentries, and their withdrawal, necessarily reached his ears, and prepared him for the movement of the troop which followed. Each trooper leading his steed with shortened rein, they deployed slowly beside the tomb, and he was compelled, during their progress, to observe the most singular quiet. The vaulted habitations of the dead were no unfrequent hiding-places in those days for the living, and to troopers, trained in the swamp warfare, to convert every situation of obscurity and darkness into a place of retreat or ambush, the slightest circumstance or movement on his part, he well knew, would result in their sudden search of his gloomy house of refuge. Through a chink in the decaying door of the vault, he watched their progress; and when they had gone from sight, swallowed up in the deep blank of the forest along the margin of the river, he once more ascended to the light. His path now promised to be free. He knew the troop to be one of his brother's regiment—a small though famous squadron—“The Congaree Blues”—proverbial for bold riding, happy horsemanship, and all of that characteristic daring which every where marked the southern cavalry throughout the war. The uniform he readily distinguished, though not the persons. He fancied that his brother was among them; and hearing no farther sound, with that impatience which was natural to his desires, and which was necessarily increased by the restraints to which they had been subjected, he prepared to go boldly forward to the mansion. But the coast was not yet clear. He had advanced a few paces only, when he heard the faint, but mellow tones of a distant bugle, rising and falling in sweet harmony with the light zephyrs which bore them to his ears. These sounds now furnished him with the true reason for his brother's flight. The enemies of his kinsman, according to his profession, were not unlikely to be his friends; yet the business upon which the heart of Edward Morton was set, and the position in which he then stood, were such as to make the presence of a British force almost as little desirable to him as had been that of his brother. His present objects admitted of no friendships. Thoroughly selfish, they could only be prosecuted at the expense of the cause in which he was engaged, and at the sacrifice of that band with which, for life and death, his own life—if his oath to them were of any value—was solemnly and indissolubly connected. Bitterly, therefore, and with renewed vexation, did he listen to the sweet but startling tones of that sudden trumpet. Cursing the course of events which, so far, that night, seemed destined to baffle his purposes, he stood for a few moments, in doubt, upon the spot where the sounds first struck his ears; hesitating whether to go forward boldly, or at once return to his place of safety. To adopt the former course, was, in his present undisguised condition, to declare to Flora Middleton the fact, which he had hitherto studiously concealed from her knowledge, of his connexion with the British cause. Such a revelation, he well knew, would, in the mind of one so religiously devoted to the whig party as was that maiden, operate most unfavourably against his personal pretensions, on the success of which, he still flattered himself, he might, in some degree, rely. While he doubted and deliberated on his course, he was startled by other sounds, which warned him of the necessity of a prompt determination. The heavy footsteps of a man, whose tread was measured like that of a soldier, were heard approaching through the grove that extended from the dwelling in the direction of the tomb; and the outlaw moved hurriedly back to the shelter he had left. He was scarcely rapid enough in his movements. The person approaching was no other than Clarence Conway. He had just parted, as we have seen, with Flora Middleton. Her last words were still sounding in his ears like some sweet, melancholy music which the language of one heart delivers, in love, for the consolation of another. The last pressure of her hand seemed still to make itself felt from his own, upward, to his heart, with a sensation which carried a thrill of joy to its deepest recesses. With the bugle of the enemy sounding on the track behind him, he had then no thought, no feeling for the enemy—and, certainly, no fear. Foes, at that moment, if not forgotten, awakened no emotion in his bosom which a smile of indifference upon his lips did not sufficiently express. From musings, the dreamy languor of which may be readily imagined, he was awakened by the sudden glimpse he had caught of his kinsman's person. The mere human outline was all that he beheld, and this for an instant only. At first, he was disposed to fancy that it was one of his own dragoons, all of whom had gone forward in that direction, and one of whom might have been left in the hurry of his comrades, or possibly detached on some special service. But the retreat of the outlaw had been too precipitate—too like a flight—not to awaken instantly the suspicions of the partisan. To challenge the fugitive by the usual summons was probably to alarm his own enemies, and was a measure not to be thought of. To hurry in pursuit was the only mode of ascertaining his object, and this mode was put in execution as promptly as resolved upon. The partisan rushed forward, but the object of his pursuit was no longer to be seen. The old field, on one hand, was bare and desolate—the park, on the left, did not attract the youth's attention. Obviously, the melancholy grove which led to and environed the ancient vault, was that to which the footsteps of the fugitive would most naturally incline. To this he pursued, until he stood beside the tomb. Then, and not till then, did he speak, challenging the fugitive to “stand” whom he could no longer see. The summons was heard the moment after the outlaw had buried himself in his place of concealment. The tones of his brother's voice arrested the outlaw—that voice awakened all his rage and hate, while reminding him of his gage of battle; and when he remembered that Clarence Conway had but that instant left the presence of the woman whom he sought, and whom he had not been permitted to see—when he remembered that he was his hated rival, and when he thought that his lips might even then be warm with the fresh kisses of hers—the feelings in his heart were no longer governable! Uniting with that gnawing impatience, which had grown almost to a fever, and was a frenzy, under his late constraint, they determined him against all hazards; and, darting from the vault, he answered the summons of his foe with a hiss of scorn and defiance. “Stand thou!—Clarence Conway—wretch and rebel! —We are met on equal terms at last.” “Ay,” cried the other, no ways startled at the sudden apparition; “well met!” and as the outlaw sprang forward from the tomb with uplifted dagger, Clarence met him with his own. A moment's collision only had ensued, when the latter struck his weapon into the mouth of his enemy, with a blow so forceful as to precipitate him back into the cavern which he had just left. Clarence sprang into the tomb after him, and there, in the deep darkness of the scene, among the mouldering coffins and dry bones of the dead, they grappled in deadly desperation. Death, and the presence of its awful trophies, had no terrors for either. The living passions of the heart were triumphant over their threatening shadows, and the struggle was renewed between the two with a degree of hate and fury that found increase rather than diminution from the solemn and dark associations by which they were encompassed. But few words were spoken, and those only in the breathing intervals which their struggles left them. The language of the outlaw was that of vituperation and hate; that of Conway, an indignation natural to feelings which revolted at the brutal and sanguinary rage of his enemy, tempered, at the same time, with equal scorn, and resolution. In Clarence Conway, the chief of the Black Riders saw only the embodied form of all the evil influences which he had felt or fancied from his boyhood; the long engendered envy and malice of twenty years finding, at length, its unqualified expression. In his eyes, he was the hateful rival who had beguiled from him with equal facility, the regards of parents, the attachments of friends, the smiles of fortune and the love of woman. Clarence, on the other hand, no longer saw the kinsman of his youth—the son of the same father—in the person of the outlaw; or, if he remembered the ties of blood at VOL. I. 20 all, it was only to warm his hostility the more against one who had so commonly outraged, and so cruelly dishonoured them! It was as the betrayer of his country, and the associate of the most savage outlaws that ever arrayed themselves against her peace and liberty, that he struck, and struck with fatal design to destroy and extirpate! Nor need it be denied that these motives were stimulated by the conviction that he himself fought for life, with a personal foe who had threatened him with all the haunting dangers of an enduring and bloody enmity—a hatred born without cause, and nourished without restraint—warmed by bad passions, mean rivalry, and a suspicious selfishness which no labour of love could render reasonable, and which could only finally cease in the death of one or both of the combatants. The incoherent language, the broken words, and fiendish threatenings of the outlaw, left nothing on this subject to conjecture; and while the two writhed together in their narrow apartment, the otherwise horrible stillness of their strife might be thought relieved and rendered human by the bursts of passion and invective which fell the while from the lips of both. But these caused no interruption to the conflict. They fought only with daggers, though both were provided with sword and pistol. A mutual sense of the proximity of those whom neither wished to alarm, rendered them careful not to employ weapons which could draw a third party to the scene of strife. Besides, the dagger was the only weapon that might be employed in their limited area with any propriety. This weapon, deadly in the close struggle as it usually is, was rendered less effectual in the imperfect light of the place, and by the baffling readiness of their rival skill. They both felt that the struggle must be fatal, and did not, accordingly, suffer their rage to disarm their providence and caution. Still, several wounds had been given and received on either side. One of these had penetrated the right arm of the partisan, but the point of the dagger had been diverted, and the wound was one of the flesh only, not deep nor disabling. The outlaw had been less fortunate. That first blow, which he had received in the mouth at the entrance of the vault, had necessarily influenced the combat as first blows usually do; and though not of serious hurt, for the point of the weapon found resistance against his clenched teeth, two of which were broken, still it seriously affected the feelings of the parties. The one it encouraged, the other it provoked to increased anger, which impaired his coolness. A second and third wound in each of his arms had followed in the vault, and a moment came in which a fourth promised to be final. Clarence had grappled closely with his kinsman, had borne him backward, and succeeded in prostrating him, face upward, upon the pile of coffins which rose in the centre of the tomb. Here, with his knee upon the breast of his enemy, one hand upon his throat, and the other bearing on high the already dripping steel, the stroke and the death seemed equally inevitable. So, indeed, the outlaw considered it; and the language of his lips at that moment of his greatest peril, spoke more decisively for his manhood than, perhaps, it had ever done before. “Strike!” he cried; “I fear you not! The devil you have served has served you faithfully in turn! I ask you not for mercy—I loathe you, Clarence Conway—I loathe and curse you to the last. Strike then, as I should have stricken you had the chance fallen to my lot.” The weakness of a human and a social sentiment made the youth hesitate. He shivered as he thought upon the ties of blood—ties which he could never entirely forget, however much they might be scorned by his profligate brother. He was still his father's son—he would have spared—he wished to spare him. While he hesitated, a new and desperate effort was made by the prostrate outlaw. Hope and fear united for a last and terrible struggle. He half rose—he grasped the arm with which Clarence held him, with demoniac strength, and flinging himself upward, with the exercise of all that muscle which he possessed in almost equal degree with his brother, he almost shook himself free from the hold which the latter had taken upon him. It was then that the dagger of Clarence descended!—then, when it became obvious that no indulgence could be given to his foe without danger to himself; but the blow, even then, was not final —not fatal! It touched no vital region. The desperate effort of the outlaw, though it failed in its object, effected another, which operated to his partial safety. The mouldering coffins upon which he was stretched, yielded beneath his gigantic struggles, sank under the violence and pressure, and ere the blow reached the heart of the threatened victim, came down, with a fearful crash, in fragments upon the damp floor of the vault. The dagger-point barely grazed the breast of the falling man; and Clarence, still grappling with his foe, and grappled by him in turn, was dragged downward to the earth, and the two lay together, for an instant, without strife, among the crushed and bleached bones of a bygone generation. Both were breathless, but there was no mitigation of their fury. With some difficulty they scrambled to their feet, separate, but only to renew their terrible embrace. “Let there be an end to this!” said Morton, hoarsely. “Let us go forth into the moonlight—we can do nothing here, it seems.” “Ay—any where!” was the reply of the other; “but let it be quickly. I have not a moment to spare.” “A moment should suffice for either; and would have done had there been sufficient light for the business. So far, Clarence Conway, you have had the matter all to yourself. But there is a day for every dog, they tell us; and though still there be no daylight, I trust that my day is at hand. Lead the way; I am ready. Let the dagger still be the weapon. It is a sure one, and not much clatter. Besides, it brings us so much the nigher to each other, which is brotherly, you know.” The sterner, perhaps the nobler, features of the outlaw stood out in bolder relief at the moment which he himself believed was one of his greatest danger. Morton was not deficient in animal courage. It was only less often apparent, because, like the Italian, he preferred the practice of a subtler agent. A fierce laugh concluded his attempt at playfulness. To this the heart of Clarence gave back no response. Though not less fearless than his brother—nay, though greatly excited by the strife, it yet had, to his mind, the aspect of a horror which he could not complacently behold. The few moments consumed in this brief dialogue, had brought him back to those reflections which the provocation of the strife had almost wholly banished. But he suffered no mental nor moral scruples, at such a moment, to impair his manhood. “I too am ready,” was his only answer as he left the vault. He was followed by the outlaw; and there, in another moment, they stood together on the green sward before the tomb, fiercely confronting each other with eyes of mortal hate—utterly unmoved by the pure and placid smiles of that maiden moon whose blessed light they were about to employ for the most unblessed purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20* CHAPTER XIX. THE COMBAT. The ancient additaments for the groundwork of the grand or terrible, the wild or warlike, would have borne aspects not unlike their own. Ordinarily, the painter of the darker passions is very apt to accompany their explosion with a sympathetic action on the part of the natural world. The hero, just before committing the deed of blood, stalks upon the scene, surrounded by the gloomy shadows of the night—storm and thunder attend upon his footsteps, and the fiery eyes of the rebuking heaven glare along his path in flashes of impetuous lightning. A voice of warning is heard to mutter in the sky!—The bloody dagger—the awful sign of the crime which is already acted in the mind of the criminal—hangs in the air above him, and marshals him the way that he must follow; while the ghosts of the past reappear, shaking their gory locks, to impede or to precipitate the ghost-like progress of the future. All things are made to act in harmony with that terrible passion which has already thrown over the heart of the possessor the uniform “brown horror” which distinguishes its own unvarying aspect. There is no blue in the transparent softness of the noonday sky—there is no living green in the fresh sward of the luxuriant earth—the songs of the one, and the mellow voices of the other, receive their savage or sad tones wholly from the desolate or depraved soul which speaks in the bosom of the fated actor. All forms and features, sights and sounds, are made to correspond with his prevailing passion; and the hues of sky and land become naturally incarnadined by the bloody mood which governs in his soul. The voices which he hears, whether of earth or sky, are only such as rise from the groaning victims, who start, perhaps, from the embrace of slumber, to sleep in that of death. But very different from these were the auxiliary aspects of that scene upon which the rival kinsmen were about to contend. Never was night more beautiful— more uniformly beautiful and tender, in any one of its thousand attributes and agents. The moon, almost at her full, was high above the forest tops, and hallowing its deep and dim recesses with innumerable streams of glory from her own celestial fountain. Few were the clouds that gathered about her path, and these, sharing in her gifts of beauty, became tributary to her lustrous progress. A gentle breeze, rising from the east, accompanied her march, and the tall pines swayed to and fro beneath its pressure, yielding a whispering music like those faint utterances of a sweet complaint which are made by the curling billows of the sea when they break and die away in a languid struggle with the shore. These breathings found fit fellowship in the gentle murmurs of the Congaree, as it rippled away on its sleepless path, at a little distance from the scene of strife. Lighted by the moon above, its winding form might be seen, in silvery glimpses, where the vistas of the woods had been opened by that tasteful art which had presided over the barony from its first settlement. Nothing was dark, nothing sad, stern, or terrible, but the human agents of the scene. There they stood, frowning defiance upon each other, and looking grim and ghastly, in the pure, sweet atmosphere of light by which they were enveloped. The aspect of the outlaw was particularly terrible, in consequence of the wound which he had received in the mouth at the beginning of the conflict. The upper lip was divided by the stroke, the teeth shattered, and, smeared and clotted with blood, his face presented the appearance of one already stamped with all the features of the grave, marked with an expression of hate and passion which increased its terrors. That of the partisan was stern, but unruffled—pale, but inflexible. His eyes were full of that fiery energy which, perhaps, distinguished equally the characters of the brothers. The lips were closely compressed, and resembled that sweet serenity, that resigned and noble melancholy, which peculiarly distinguishes the same feature in the instance of nearly every Indian warrior that we have ever seen. There was no faltering in his soul—he was as firm of purpose as his enemy; but there were other moods at work within him which the other could not feel. He could not feel hate alone, to the exclusion of other and better feelings. The outlaw unbuckled the sabre from his side, the sable belt, and threw them down, with the pistols which he carried, at the foot of the vault. He seemed resolute that there should be no possible obstruction to his movements in the struggle which was about to take place. Clarence Conway, on the other hand, took no such precaution. He calmly surveyed the movements of his opponent without changing muscle or position. His eye glanced, however, with a momentary anxiety, to the clear blue vault, and the pale, pure presence looking down upon him from above, and turned involuntarily, though for a single instant only, to the distant dwelling of Flora Middleton. But this was not a moment to betray the weakness of the sentimentalist or lover. His enemy stood before him. The outlaw had witnessed the direction of his foeman's eye, and the words of provocation gushed from him in increasing bitterness. “Ay, look, Clarence Conway—look! It may be for the last time! For that matter we may both look; for I tell you, there shall be no child's play between us. Here, on this green turf, and under that smiling heaven, shall I be stretched in death, ere I yield up a single sentiment of that hate which makes it necessary that one or both of us should die for the peace and security of the other.” “And is it necessary, either for your peace or mine, that such should be the case?” demanded Clarence Conway. “Ay! absolutely necessary. We cannot breathe the same atmosphere. Come!” Their arms were raised, their feet planted in opposition—their eyes fixed upon each other, and riveted in glassy, serpent-like watchfulness and calm. “Are you ready?” was the question of the outlaw. “Stay!” replied Clarence, while he continued to regard his enemy with a face of increased deliberation. “Stay!—and why should we stay?” retorted the other. “Are you so soon quieted? Does your stomach revolt at the idea of a final struggle which shall end the strife between us?” “It does!” “Ha! Has it then come to that?” was the ironical speech of the outlaw; but Clarence interrupted him with a cool firmness of tone and look which disarmed the intended sarcasm. “You may spare your irony, Edward Morton. That I fear you not, you should know. That I am your superior in strength you have long since discovered— that I am, at least, your match with any weapon known to either of us, you cannot deny; and you know that I have no dread of death.” “To what does all this tend? It means every thing or nothing. Grant what you have said, still it does not follow that you shall triumph over me. You may slay me, but I can grapple with you, Clarence Conway—I can rush upon your weapon, and, sacrificing myself, succeed in killing you! Ha! is not that undeniable also?” “Perhaps so;” was the deliberate answer. “But even this does not influence me in what I say. There is a consideration of far more weight which would make me avoid this conflict.” “Ah! it is that, eh? But you shall not avoid it! I am a desperate man, Clarence Conway, and such a man always has the life of his enemy at the point of his dagger!” “Be it so; but hear me. For all your crimes, all your hate and hostility to me—all your treachery to your country—still I shall find no pleasure in being your executioner.” “Indeed! But be not too sure. It has not yet come to that!” cried the other. “There are two to play at this game, and I flatter myself that I shall turn the tables upon you in this bout. We have some light now on the subject, and these pricks which you gave me in the dark, have rather warmed me for the conflict. They rather better my chances—so, come on. We cannot too soon make a finish now.” “You deceive yourself, Edward Conway—fatally deceive yourself if you have such a fancy;” replied Clarence solemnly. “If we encounter again I shall kill you. Nothing can save you. I feel it—I know it. I cannot help but kill you.” “Insolent braggart! But, come on!” “This is vain. Hear me but an instant more, and judge. I shall find no pleasure in taking your life. I cannot forget many things, and I am not desperate. However you may deride and despise the claims of blood and the opinions of society, it is impossible for me to do so. For this reason I would forego the indulgence of those passions, Edward Conway—” “Not Conway—Morton, Cunningham!—any thing but Conway!” A smile of scorn passed over the lips of Clarence. “I thank you for your correction,” he said. “But this is a small matter. To return. My passions and enmities are scarcely less active than yours; but I would forego their enjoyment because of my greater responsibilities. I now make you an offer; let us not fight; and you shall go free. I will facilitate your progress to Charlestown—nay, ensure it—and you will then be enabled, unencumbered by the villanous banditti to which you have been attached, to fly the country. I know that you have a large booty stored away in Jamaica—enough to give you competence for life. Let that suffice you. Leave the country while the chance is allowed you—while you may do so in safety. Three weeks hence, and Greene will traverse all this region!” “Fool fancies!” exclaimed the other rudely. “Those are Rawdon's trumpets.” “You will not long hear them, except sounding the retreat. The war is well nigh over.” “Pshaw! this is mere folly. We came here to fight, I think. The sooner the better! Come!” “I would save you—spare you!” “I shall not spare you! Your conceit is insufferable, and shall be whipped out of you, by heavens! this very night. Come on, then; I long to give and take my quittance. Your head is turned, I see, by that woman. Your Flora, my Flora—the Flora of Congaree—you have been lipping, have you?—and you like the taste— sweet flavour!—” “Ruffian—wretch!” cried Clarence, with a fury that seemed as little governable as that of the outlaw, “you are doomed. I cannot spare you now.” “I ask you not. Let the steel speak for both of us. Mine has been blushing at the time you have consumed in prating. Come on—come on! Strike as if your heart were in it, Clarence Conway, for, by God's death, I will have it in your heart, if hell has not grown deaf to human prayer. Good blade, to your work! It is some pleasure, Clarence Conway, to know that yours is tolerably pure blood—at least it will do no dishonour to my dagger.” The struggle followed instantaneously. The outlaw proceeded to act his declared intentions. His object seemed to be to get within the arm of his opponent—to close at all hazards, and sacrifice himself in the bloody determination to destroy his enemy. But Clarence was no ordinary foe. His anger did not deprive him of his coolness, and his skill with the weapon was far beyond that of most men of his time. Still, it required all his watchfulness and circumspection—all his readiness of eye and arm, to baffle the purpose of the other. The blind fury of the outlaw, perhaps, served him quite as effectually as did his own resources. It made him fearless, but not fearful—full of purposes of danger, but not dangerous—that is, comparatively speaking—for, so long as the partisan preserved his composure, and kept only on the defensive, his enemy did not find it so certainly true as he had affirmed, that a desperate man always carries the life of his enemy at the point of his dagger. He had tried this more than once, and had always been repelled, sometimes with hurts, which were not always slight, though, as yet, in no case dangerous. His constant failure warned him of the folly of his own fury, and its utter ineffectiveness to achieve the object of his desires. He recovered himself, and adopted another policy. He renewed those coarse sneers and insinuations which had been always effectual in provoking Clarence, and which had closed their previous conference. He spoke of Flora Middleton, and in such language as was admirably calculated to throw a lover off his guard. “You flatter yourself,” he said, “that you have just made a conquest; but have you asked its value? I tell you, Clarence Conway, if ever woman spoke falsely, Flora Middleton spoke falsely to you when she consented to be yours. I know her—nay, man, when you charged me with having been to Briar Park, you knew but half the truth. Shall I tell you that she was then as indulgent to the chief of the Black Riders as she has been since to his more moral kinsman. Here, by this old vault, did we walk with her at evening, and you know what it is, or you should know, to wander among dim groves at sunset with a romantic damsel. The heart will yield if ever. It softens with the hour, and melts—ha! are you touched—touched at last? Know, then, it was my turn to lip and taste as cordially—” “Liar and slave!” cried Clarence, striking at him furiously as he heard these words; “know I not that you have striven to fill her pure ears with falsehoods almost as foul as those you would now thrust into mine?” “You have it!” cried the other with a yell of delight, as his lunge carried the point of his dagger into the breast of the partisan—a flesh wound only, but one in dangerous proximity to the angry heart that was now boiling in its neighbourhood. The youth felt his imprudence, but if he had not, there was a counselling friend at hand, who did not suffer him to go unreminded. This was Jack Bannister, who, in the shelter of a tree contiguous, to which he had crawled unseen, had been a spectator of the brief conflict, during the short time it had lasted, on the outside of the vault. “Don't you let him fool you, Clarence—he's only trying to blind you—don't mind him—he's a born liar, and if you stick as you should, he'll die with a lie in his mouth. Strike away, Clarence, as you can strike; and only forget that you ever had a father who was so foolish as to git a son of the wrong breed. Put it to him, and shut up your natur' till it's all done. God ha' mercy 'pon me, but it seems so nateral for me now to want to put in and kill him.” “Ha! you have brought your bullies upon me!” were the words of Morton, as the first accents of Bannister reached his ears. “But I fear them not!” and he renewed the assault with increased determination, if that indeed were possible. “Keep back—meddle not, John Bannister,” cried Clarence. “I need no assistance.” “I know it, Clarence; but, Lord love you, don't git into a foolish passion. Go to it like a trade, and jest hit and stick as if you was a-managing a dug-out, or some such foolish consarn. For sich a foul-mouth as he to talk agin Miss Flora! Why, it's as foolish as a wolf to bark at the moonlight. But don't let me interrupt you. Go to it!—I'm jest a-looking on to see the eend, and obsarve fair play; only make haste, Clarence—shut him up as soon as you can, for the bugle's a-sounding from the head of the avenue, and there's little time to lose.” The warning was not to be disregarded, and Clarence Conway soon brought the strife to an issue. The resumption of his caution seduced the outlaw into a renewal of his rashness, and his dagger hand was caught in the grasp of the partisan at the same moment when the VOL. I. 21 weapon of the other sunk into his heart. Clarence relaxed his hold upon his victim the instant that the blow was given. He fancied that he had given him the coup de grace as he intended; and a strange, keen, sudden pang rushed like lightning through his own bosom. The outlaw, meanwhile, felt himself about to fall. A faintness covered his frame—his sight was growing darkened; and, with the last convulsive moment of reflection, he threw himself forward upon the breast of his enemy, whose dagger-point was now turned upon the ground. His left arm was tightly clasped about the form of Clarence, while his right, with all the remaining consciousness of his mind, and the concentrated, but fast failing vigour of his frame, addressed a blow at the heart of the latter, which it needed sufficient strength alone to render fatal. But the arm of the outlaw sank down in the effort ere the dagger reached its mark. His hold upon his enemy was instantly relaxed, and he fell fainting at the feet of Clarence, ere the latter had sufficiently recovered from the horror which he felt, to be altogether conscious of the danger from which he had escaped. With every justification for the deed which necessity could bring, he yet felt how full of pain and sorrow, if not crime, was the shedding of a brother's blood. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEA AND BLANCHARD HAVE LATELY PUBLISHED Mr. Cooper's New Novel of MERCEDES OF CASTILE. A ROMANCE OF THE DAYS OF COLUMBUS. BY THE AUTHOR OF “The Pathfinder,” “Pioneers,” &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. Whether we are prepossessed by our penchant for history, and especially for all that relates to that glorious and heroic epoch of American History, the age of Columbus or not, we cannot say; but rising fresh from the attentive and thorough perusal of this novel, we pronounce it the very best Mr. Cooper has ever written. It is well considered and highly finished in all its parts. The plot is natural and free from the puzzling intricacy which was once the fashion among novel writers; the dialogue is characteristic of the personages introduced, historical and fictitious, and suitable to the age in which it is represented to have taken place; which remark the reader may easily verify by comparing it with the recorded conversations of that age. The delineation of such characters as Isabella the Queen, Columbus, the Pinzos, St. Angle and Quintanilla, are, to us, perfectly delightful. They have all the freshness of present life, with all the dignity of remote and heroic history. The action too of the story is so grand, and truly national, so full of epic splendour, as well as the gorgeousness and glare of romance, that one devours the story with an appetite unfelt since the days when Kenilworth and Ivanhoe appeared.
