      <field name="fulltext">1* PREFACE. The following pages are intended to embody and illustrate a portion of the more romantic incidents which actually occurred in the early settlements of Vermont, with the use of but little more of fiction than was deemed sufficient to weave them together, and impart to the tissue a connected interest. In doing this, the author has ventured, for the sake of more unity of design, upon one or two anachronisms; or, in other words, he has brought together, or nearly so, some incidents, connected with the portions of the two different periods embraced in the work, viz. the New York controversy and the revolution—which occurred at intervals. Other than this, he is sensible of no violations of historical truth. Without consulting, as perhaps he should, the models to be found in the works of approved writers in this department of literature, he has endeavored to give a true delincation of the manners and feelings of those among whom the scene is laid, together with the deeds and characters of some of the leading actors in the events he has attempted to describe, as gathered from the imperfect published histories of the times, from the private papers to which he has had access, and more particularly from the lips of the few aged relics of that period who actively participated in the wild and stirring scenes which peculiarly marked the settlement of this part of the country. How far he has succeeded in the attempt it is for the public, not for him, to decide. THE AUTHOR. Montpelier, March, 1839.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The events which transpired in the early settlement of Vermont, and especially during the seven years immediately preceding our great struggle for national independence, deserve a conspicuous place in what has been termed the romance of history.— The situation in which the settlers found themselves placed, about the beginning of the last mentioned period was one very peculiarly calculated to arouse the individual feelings of men, and raise their minds to that pitch of desperate excitement, when, spurning all further restraints, they, like the pent fires of the earth, break through the barriers that circumscribe the ordinary course of human action, and leap at once into the arena of daring deeds and chivalrous exploits. They had derived the titles to their lands from patents made under the authority of the British crown, and issued by the royal governor of New Hampshire,—to which province it was then generally understood their territory unquestionably belonged. A claim to this territory, however, was soon set up by the government of New York: and in the process of time certain statesmen of the latter province, corruptly combining with influential land speculators, procured, by their intrigues at the British court, a decree establishing Connecticut river as the boundary line between the two beligerent provinces, and thus throwing the whole of the disputed territory within the governmental jurisdiction of New York. In a change of jurisdiction merely the settlers of the New Hampshire Grants, as this tract of country was then usually designated, would have doubtless peaceably acquiesced. But when, by one of the most bold and singular perversions of law and justice to be found on record, the tribunals of New York decided this decree to have a retrospective operation, so as to involve the titles of the lands as well as the jurisdiction of the territory, the voice of the indignant settlers unitedly rose from every part of their Green Mountains, in loud and determined remonstrances: for, this decision, which was of itself a legal paradox, going to destroy the right of property already irrevocably granted by the crown— the very same source of power by which it was now proposed a new right with new conditions should be irrevocably established—subjected them to the exasperating alternative of either relinquishing their farms, which they had once honestly purchased and paid for, with all those improvements that had cost them so much labor and privation, or of purchasing and paying for them again on such terms as those who claimed to be their new masters might choose to exact. The latter, with their limited pecuniary resources, they at once saw that it would be utterly impossible for most of them to do; while to the former their proud spirits would never for a moment brook the thought of submitting. Paying, therefore, after they had vainly exhausted every argument in petition and remonstrance to the governor and his council, and as vainly attempted to defend a few of the first suits brought for the possession of their farms before his obsequious tribunal; paying, we say, no further attention to the summonses to quit which now poured thickly upon them, they soon found their secluded settlement invaded by the greedy swarms of their cormorant foes, attended by sheriffs, each with a large armed posse for a forcible ejection of the inhabitants, and surveyors with their assistants for laying out and locating the unoccupied territory. Having thus found, that peaceable measures were wholly unavailing, the now aroused and determined settlers unanimously resolved on resistance, and immediately put themselves in an attitude to carry their resolution into effect. An independent organization was accordingly established throughout the Grants, consisting of committees of safety, as they were termed, appointed to act as provisional courts for trying offenders, supervising the public concerns in their respective towns, and generally to serve, it is believed, as delegates to the general convention which, from time to time, assembled to consult on the public welfare, and make such regulations and decrees as the exigencies might require; while to enforce these orders and decrees, and to defend the settlers from aggressions of the New York authorities, military associations were formed, the members of which soon became generally known by the appellation of the Green Mountain Boys. And although the shedding of blood was generally avoided by them in repelling these intruders upon their soil, yet punishment of some kind was sure, on the commission of every offence, to be promptly administered. These punishments were various and singular—sometimes extremely ingenious and laughable. The most common mode, however, consisted in the application of the beech rod, or the Beech Seal, as they were pleased to term it, in allusion to the emblem of the great seal of New Hampshire, of which their parchment deeds, probably, bore the impress; while this novel method of applying it, they humorously contended, was but to confirm their old titles. In this spirited manner was the contest commenced and continued by the settlers; and although armed forces were several times sent into the Grants to aid the authorities in ejecting the inhabitants, and although all the leaders of the latter were indicted and outlawed as felons by the courts of New York, and proclamation after proclamation issued by the governor of that province, offering large rewards for the delivery of those marked for the punishment of death, and teeming with denunciations against all those who should offer further resistance; yet so united were the people, and so determined the character of their opposition, that their baffied antagonists were never able to accomplish but the most insignificant results for their years of labor in endeavoring to effect a foothold in the territory of Vermont, while the whole controversy exhibited to the world the singular spectacle of a few thousand poor settlers, thinly scattered over a wilderness of a hundred miles in extent, successfully resisting for a series of years the authority of a province, apparently determined on their subjugation, and possessing perhaps fifty times their population and resources. Having thus glanced at the leading features of this embittered controversy, (out of the events of which a large portion of the following story is woven,) to enable the reader more readily to understand many of the allusions he may find in the progress of the tale, we will now proceed with the narration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. “And now for scenes where nature in her pride Roar'd in rough floods, and wav'd in forests wide— Where men were taught the desert path to trace, And the rude pleasures of the mountain chase— With light canoe to plough the glassy lake, And from its depths the silvery trout to take— Where nerves of iron grew, and souls of tone To soft refinement's tranquil scenes unknown.” Those who have wandered along the banks of the Otter Creek, in search of the beautiful and picturesque, may have extended their rambles, perhaps, to lake Dunmore, which lies embosomed among the hills a few miles to the eastward of that quiet stream. If so, their taste for natural scenery has doubtless been amply gratified: for there is no spot in the whole range of the Green Mountains that combines more of the requisites for a perfect landscape than this romantic sheet of water and its surrounding shores. Of an oblong form, about four miles in length and one in breadth, this lake, or pond, as such bodies of water are more usually denominated among us, lies extended between the main ridge and a collateral eminence on the west, of a height but little more than sufficient to serve as a secure embankment to this noble reservoir of the hills. From the eastern shore the land rises abruptly into a lofty mountain, which, like some mighty giantess, sits enthroned in the mid heavens, her head turbaned with a wreath of white mist, and looking down with seeming fondness and care upon the bright daughter, that reflecting back her own rude image, lies quietly reposing in her lap, receiving the rich supply of a thousand pearly rills that come gushing to her opening lips. To the north and south, open long and beautiful vistas, extending along over the bright extremities of the lake, and terminating among the far off peaks of the Green Mountains; while from the western shore the land, after a gentle rise for a short distance, falls off rapidly toward the Otter, leaving the broad and extensive valley of that stream open to the vision, which now wanders unobstructed to the western borders of the lake Champlain, where the long chain of mountains, that rise immediately beyond, lies sleeping in the blue distance, and bounds the view of this magnificent scene. It was near sunset, on one of the last days of April, and in the same year and month which were marked by the opening scene of our great national drama, that four stout and hardy looking men, two of them of about the middle age, and two considerably younger, were seen occupying a large log canoe near the eastern shore of the lake just described, and engaged fishing for trout. Their success through the day in ensnaring `the pride of the pure waters,' as the trout has been appropriately termed, had been ample, as was evinced by the large strings of this beautiful fish lying on the bottom of the boat beneath the feet of their respective captors. Now, however, as the rapidly lengthening shadows of the dark primeval forest, that thickly lined 2 the shores, had nearly closed over the lake, the party began to manifest a disposition to relinquish the exciting labors of the day. One sat listless and unemployed in his seat; another was taking in, and winding up his line; while a third had handled the oars, and sat patiently awaiting the movements of the fourth, who seemed intent on securing, before quitting the station, one more victim, as `a most severe large one,' he said, was brushing round his hook. At length the speckled tantalizer, after playing warily round the bait awhile, seized it with a desperation that seemed to imply at once his suspicions and his determination to test them, and was drawn flapping and floundering into the boat, amidst a shout of exultation from the company, who unanimously declared the fish to be a ten pounder, and the capital prize of all that had that day been taken. All being now in readiness, the boat was rowed slowly toward the shore in the direction of a spot indicated as the place of their temporary quarters by a slight, wreathy line of blue smoke, which had risen from their noon fiires, and still hung undissipated along the precipitous cliffs of the mountain above. On reaching the shore the party, after taking out their fish and carefully concealing their canoe in a thick clump of overhanging bushes, proceeded to their retreat, which proved to be a cavern in the rocks, at the foot of the mountain, here shutting down within a dozen rods of the lake. The front of this cave consisted of a sort of natural porch, eight or ten feet in length, and of, perhaps, about half that number of feet in width, formed by a projection of the rocks above and on each side, so as to enclose the intervening space. From the centre of the arena thus formed in front, an entrance, wide enough only to admit one person at a time, opened into the interior, or main part of the cavern, a spacious and lofty room branching off in several dark recesses that appeared to extend far into the rocks. This cave had once been a favorite lodge with the Indians, as was evident from the flint arrow-heads, and other indications of aboriginal life, discovered in and about the place; and in late years it had been the usual resort of professional hunters, and others of the neighboring settlement, when out for more than one day on fishing and hunting excursions on the lake or its vicinity, as it afforded them comfortable quarters for the night, and such as could easily be secured from the intrusion of wild beasts, or Indians, small parties of whom, though not generally very hostile at this period, were still occasionally seen skulking among these mountains. The party now present, as before remarked, were four in number. The two eldest of these had nothing remarkable in their appearance to distinguish them from the ordinary run of men, except their broad chests and strong muscular limbs, which they possessed in common with most of the settlers. Of the other two, whom we will more particularly describe, one was a young woodsman of very singular and striking appearance. He was full seven feet high, and as straight as an arrow. From his trunk, which, though strongly made, and quite as large as that of a common stout man, looked like a may-pole, rose a long, slender neck, surmounted by a small apple-shaped head. His features might have been regular when he slept, but in conversation, in which he was always sure to have a part, they were made to play such anticks, by way of acting as gesturers to the queer conceits with which his brain was forever teeming, that it would have been difficult to tell what any one of them might have been when reduced to a state of quiescence. His mouth with a peculiar twist seemed to move at will in a half circle from one ear to the other; while his nose, playing at cross-purposes with his mouth, was seemingly wriggled up to the eyebrows, or let down to the chin at the option of its owner. These, with the eyes, which were no less singularly expressive, combined to form a countenance to the last degree comical, though, with all its predominating humor, great good nature and considerable native intelligence were very visibly mingled in its expression. This man went by the name of Pete Jones, or long legged Pete, as was his more common appellation among his companions. The other person, the only one of the party now remaining to be described, was evidently far superior in every respect, except physical powers, to the rest of the company. His exterior exhibited a high degree of manly beauty, both in form and feature; while a fine dark eye, with a cleanly turned, rectilinear nose, and a high square forehead, indicated tastes of an intellectual character. His countenance was expressive of keen perceptions, and manifested also, like that of the person last described, a strong disposition to wit and mirthfulness; though this disposition, unlike that of his rude companion, had been evidently chastened and trained by education and intercourse with refined society, the advantages of both of which his language and manners showed he had received. His whole appearance, indeed, was such as would induce to the probable conclusion that a romantic turn of mind, with a love of the exciting scenes of the forest, or still more exciting strife in which the settlers were engaged with the neighboring colony, had led him to a temporary adoption of his present course of life, and that he was rather an amateur woodsman than one from habit or necessity. When the party reached their quarters, the person, whose description last occupied us, separated himself from the rest, and, clambering up the steep, sat down on a commanding cliff, some hundred feet above the cave, leaving the duties of the camp to be performed by those who remained below. The latter, after kindling up a fire in front of the cave, proceeded to bring from the interior a light, portable kettle and piece of salt junk, articles with which such parties usually went provided, and soon became busily engaged in dressing and preparing a portion of the fruits of their day's labors for an evening repast. `Smith,' said the tall woodsman, whose peculiarities we have before noted, now turning to one of his comrades as they were proceeding with their culinary labors; `say, Smith, what do you suppose Mr. Selden has perched himself on that old crazy crag up there for? He looks as glum and hazy as a catowl winking at the sun with one eye and watching a tree-toad with the other.' `Well done for you, Pete Jones!' responded the person addressed; `I rather guess you have hit the nail on the head this time; for Selden, I've noticed, is fond of looking at prospects—scenery, I think he calls it—well, while he has an eye for that, it's my opinion he is on the look-out for mischief, which he thinks may perhaps be brewing for us somewhere— what say you, Brown?' `Well, I don't know,' replied the latter, a plain, blunt, and somewhat dogged looking man; `there may be something in your idea—and come to think of it, I guess it is so: You know we caught a 2 * glimpse or two of a fellow skulking round the shore over yonder last evening as we were coming across to take up our quarters here; and I remember that Selden seemed to watch his movements as if he had some suspicions that the fellow might be a spy upon us.' `That's it,' rejoined Smith; `and if Selden named the affair to the Captain when he joined us last night, as I'll warrant you he did, seeing they had considerable private talk together, most likely he got orders to keep a spare eye for breakers to-day. I have noticed several times this afternoon that he seemed to be looking round the lake rather anxiously; and it was that which set me to thinking.' `By the way,' interposed Jones; `what in the world can have got the Captain, that he aint in by this time? not a single loud word has his rifle spoken to-day, to my hearing.' `He has doubtless taken a wide range to day,' replied Smith, who assumed to be the best guesser of the trio; `but an eye as keen, and an aim as sure as the young Captain's, never need be exercised a whole day for nothing on these mountains. He don't come home empty to night, you'll find.' `I wish he would come, however,' observed Brown; `I am anxious to know what are to be the orders for tomorrow. I hope he wont make us wait here another day for more to join us before we proceed on the business we came for. We have now been nearly three days, coming and here, without a chance of setting our seals to the back of a single Yorker. I would'nt have volunteered and left my work at this busy season but for Captain Warrington's promise to let us have right at 'em, and be off again. And I would'nt at no rate, if he had not fought so like a young lion for me at the time these land sharks turned us, wife, little ones and all, out into the snow. He did me God's service at that time; so I thought I ought to oblige him by coming. Though besure I was obliging my own feelings about as much; for, so help me Heaven! I would go fourteen miles barefoot in January for a chance to pay off scores upon those same York gentry.' `So would I,' remarked Smith; `for what was your case may soon be mine, unless we all turn out, and drive the scoundrels from the Grants every time they put foot within them. So we must not grudge a little time spent in paying off our debts in this manner, seeing we shall be doing the public a service at the same time. Only think of Warrington! He has spent more than half his time in this way for the last three years; and all he has ever got by it has been to have a price set upon his head.' `They have set a price on my head too,' gloomily resumed the other; `but as for the Captain, he will have his reward in heaven; while they have made me so savage and murderous in my feelings that I begin to fear that heaven will be no place for me.' `Well, I owe the scamps nothing in particular myself, I believe,' observed Jones; `but not knowing how soon I might, seeing as how I had lately bought a new lot down there near Old Ti, I thought I might as well join you a spell to learn the way and manner of fixing the chaps. And I calculated if any body could show me 'twas Captain Charley, who they say is a trifle braver than Julius Cæsar, besides having a heart as big as a meeting-house.' `What would you say of Ethan Allen at that rate?' asked Smith, laughing. `Ethan Allen? Lordy! why, two Alexanders, with half a dozen Turks thrown in to stiffen the upper lip, would be used up in making the priming to Ethan Allen! But hoo! what in the divil's name has come among us now?' continued the speaker, pointing to a new figure that had arrived unperceived, and noiselessly taken a station within a few yards of the company. All eyes were now turned to the spot indicated by the words and odd gesticulations of their companion. There stood a young Indian, quietly looking at the company, or rather, after the peculiarity of his race, looking at every thing else but the company, the moment they turned and confronted him. He held a rifle in his hand, while his dress differed but little from the ordinary garb of the settlers. `Umph!' he at length exclaimed in the peculiar, jerking gutteral of the native Indian; `Massa Cappen—him no here!' `Guessed exactly right, Tawney!' cried Jones, awakening from the momentary surprise into which he, as well as his companions, had been thrown by the unexpected appearance of such a visiter; `but what do you want with the Captain, my beauty?' `Umph! you ask, when me tell, then you know,' quickly replied the Indian, with the apparent object both to evade the question and retort on the interrogator for the manner in which it was put. `Right, again!' exclaimed Smith, pleased at the rebuff thus received by the professed joker of the party; `here, Jones, let me manage him. Where did you leave your company, friend?' he continued, addressing the native coaxingly—`I conclude there are more of your people somewhere hereabouts?' `Umph!' answered the native with a sarcastic smile; `Now you fraid—scare—why you no run?' `Righter than ever!' shouted Jones, laughing heartily in turn at his baffled comrade, who had fared even worse than himself in the rencounter. Other methods were then taken to draw from the Indian his name and business, but without the least success. He either stood mute, or answered with such odd evasions, that they soon gave over the attempt, and called to Selden on the hill, intimating that his presence was needed below. That person, who proved to be second in command in the expedition, as if partly apprized of what was going on, immediately came down and appeared among them. `Leftenant Selden,' said Jones, `they say you can make poetry out of rocks and trees, if you are a mind to—now we want to see what you can make out of this fellow.' `He is very evidently a domesticated Indian,' seriously replied the person addressed, who appeared just then to be in no humor to relish the jokes of the other. `He probably resides with some family in the vicinity. I think I have heard Warrington speak of meeting one of his description in a hunting adventure in this quarter.' `Well, he inquired for the captain,' observed Smith. `Then he has some business with him, I presume,' rejoined Selden; `some friendly message, perhaps. `Umph! that man say it,' said the subject of their discourse, pointing to the former with an expressive and respectful look. `We will try then to hasten the Captain's return,' observed Selden, and taking from his pocket a sort of whistle, formed from the leg-bone of a deer, he blew a blast whose loud, shrill note was capable of being heard at a great distance. A strict silence of several moments was now observed by the whole party in listening for a reply from their leader, who, it was understood, carried about him a crresponding instrument. At length, instead of a reply from a whistle, the sharp report of a rifle burst from a neighboring glen, and, echoing wildly from cliff to cliff in the surrounding stillness, died slowly away on the distant mountains. `There he is!' `There goes the Captain's rifle—I should know her voice among a thousand,' simultaneously burst from the lips of several of the company. `Just as I told you,' said Smith; `I knew he would never return empty. That shot, mark me, brought down a deer, which he had in his eye when the Leftenant whistled, and prevented his answering the call, which no small game would.' The event soon proved the truth of the last speaker's conjecture. The heavy, slow tread, as of one carrying some weighty load, now became distinguishable at a distance in the woods, the sounds falling more and more distinctly on the ear every moment, as they approached the spot where the expectant and excited party stood, eagerly straining their eyes to catch the first glimpse of their huntsman leader. At length he emerged from the bushes, bearing a noble buck upon his shoulders. Advancing, amidst the congratulations of his followers, he came up to the spot, and, with the air of one relieved from a heavy burden, threw down his prize to the ground before them. Of the probable age of twenty-six or eight, he was a man of a very fine and even majestic appearance. Though tall and muscular, so compactly and finely set were his limbs, that his contour presented nothing to the eye in the least disproportioned or ungainly. His features seemed to correspond in regularity of formation to the rest of his person, while his countenance was rather of the cool and deliberate cast, indicative, however, of a mild, benevolent disposition, as well as a sound, reflecting intellect. Every developement, indeed, whether of his shapely head or manly countenance, went to show a strong, well balanced character, and one capable of action beyond the scope of ordinary men. His dress, which was that of a huntsman, was neat—not rich—but tastefully arranged and well fitted. A mahogany-stocked rifle, richly chased with silver, with small arms partially concealed in his dress, completed his equipments. `Heaven save me from another such jaunt,' were his first words after he had thrown down his load and recovered himself a little; `a noble buck, indeed, but the chase has been rather a dear one.' `I don't see how it could well have been otherwise, Captain,' observed Selden, now evidently in high spirits and disposed for a little merriment— `Your huntsmen, whenever a deer's in the race, Like your lovers, of course, must expect a dear chase. `Mine has been somewhat dearer, however, I think,' replied the former with an appreciating smile, `than was necessary to give zest to those savory trout, which, by the way, I am right glad to see so nearly ready for the partaking.' `Yes,' rejoined the other, glancing round at the Indian, who stood demure and silent in the background, with his face partly averted from the company, `and yet I know not, really, Captain Warrington, but you may have other fish to fry first.' `And just about the oddest fish, too, that we have caught to-day, Captain,' said Jones, instantly understanding the allusion of the last speaker: `I rather think he must be a sort of shell-fish, from the difficulty we found in getting his mouth open.' `O ho!' exclaimed Warrington, his eye now for the first time resting on the form of the Indian, and his countenance clearing up from the puzzled expression that had come over it for the instant at the enigmatical words of his friends; `a new recruit! that explains your call, the wherefore I was about to ask—a new recruit of doubtful credentials, eh?' So saying he advanced to the side of the Indian youth and attentively examined his features; while the object of his scrutiny stood perfectly immoveable and apparently unconscious of the examination he was undergoing, till perceiving by the hesitation of the other that he was not likely to be recognized, he, without looking up, or varying the expression of a single muscle of his face, quietly observed, `Massa Cappen no remember Neshobee—no remember shoot three wolf.' `Aha?' said the other, recalled by the last allusion; `the same poor fellow that I so providentially came across, and relieved from that savage pack of wolves last year, on these very mountains? You may well remember that escape, my friend. But it is strange I did not know you.' `Neshobee hunt all day,' resumed the Indian, intent on rehearsing the event, the remembrance of which seemed to light up his countenance to something like the indications of feeling, and incline him to unusual loquacity; `hunt, hunt—kill no deer—dark come fast. Now hear wolf way out there, howl! howl! Now way out here, howl! howl! Now um come together, howl! howl!— Now near off, howl! howl! Now me know what um want, and climb small tree quick. Wolf come, five, six, hungry and lap um mouth. Me shoot; kill one, and go to load um up again—so no think nothing, and drop um rifle low down—wolf jump high, catch um away—now rifle all gone—no get um— wolf get mad fast—bite um tree, gnaw, gnaw, wolf no do so fore. Now tree begin shake, shake to fall soon. Now bend, bend, slow long down—wolf jump, jump, snap um white teeth, and most jest catch um Neshobee. Now hoo! bang! one wolf kick over dead—Cappen out there in the bush.— Shoot again, two dead! Shoot again, three dead! Now the rest two wolf begin to mistrust to run away afore they dead too. Now Neshobee come down—stay all night in cave with um Cappen—him very good, no forget um.' `Very nearly correct, I believe, Neshobee,' observed Warrington, as the Indian closed his recital, the longest perhaps he ever made in his life, for unluckily, it may be, for the romance of our tale, Neshobee was no Logan or Red Jacket, either in length of speech, or that peculiar eloquence, which most of our writers seem to delight in attributing to the sons of the forest; `very nearly correct, but are you out on another hunt in this quarter, or does other business bring you here at this time?' `No much hunt, me come for.' `What then?' `Missus Story talk um on paper for Cappen better nor Neshobee say,' replied the Indian, handing Warrington a small dingy scrap of paper. The latter, after running hastily over the contents of the billet, which caused his eye to kindle with enthusiasm as he read, immediately turned to the company, and, with a cheerful, animated air, observed, `It is from our friend, widow Story, of the Creek down here, and contains news of interest, my boys—shall I read it to you?' `Aye, aye, Captain,' was the eager response. 3 `Listen then.' “Capt. W.—I tear out the blank leaf of my bible to say, the Philistines be upon thee, Sampson. They came over the Creek somewhere north of here, and, after a short consultation near the edge of my clearing, from which I luckily espied them, struck off towards the lake. Munroe, as usual, heads the party—ten in number, as I counted. There are five of you, at least; and that is enough, if you are of the stuff I think you, to attend to confirming our titles in this neighborhood. My messenger is a chance one, but true and friendly, and may be enlisted, I think, for the night's work, if needed. God speed you all. ANN STORY.” This spirited epistle was received by the company with a `loud hurra for the widow!' and notwithstanding it brought them the startling intelligence that the Sheriff of Albany county, with an armed force of twice their own number, was on the march to seize them, two of whom, at least, were known to be under sentence of outlawry, for former resistance to the New York authorities, while attempting to execute their cruel mandates on the persons or property of the settlers—notwithstanding this, the news was received with the liveliest expressions of joy and enthusiasm. An escape from their pursuers into the forest, or on to the water in their canoe, which was the only one in the lake, they well knew might easily be effected. But this was no part of the plan of this resolute little band of Green Mountain Boys; nor was the possibility of their being overpowered and taken deemed by them scarcely more worthy of their consideration. Their object was the punishment of their foes, for the accomplishment of which this was hailed by them all as a golden opportunity. From the unwonted boldness with which this noted troubler of the Grants was attempting to push so far into the interior with so small a number of men, all of whom were supposed to be unacquainted with the forest in this part of the country, it was rightly conjectured that he must have been apprized, by some traitorous settler, not only of the exact situation of the present rendezvous, but also of the number of these occupying it; and for similar reasons it was concluded that this person must now be with the approaching enemy, acting as guide in conducting them to the spot, where they doubtless anticipated taking their intended victims by complete surprize, and then hurrying with them by night over the country to the British fort at Ticonderega, before the settlers could be rallied for a rescue. In this opinion our band were confirmed by the suspicious appearance of a man, who, as before intimated, had been seen the evening before luikirg round the shores of the lake, and who, it was now scarcely longer to be doubted, was a spy, dogging them to such place as they might select for their encampment. Next to the sheriff, therefore, and even before him, was this person, whose offence was considered the most heinous of the two, particularly marked for punishment; and it was determined to identify and seize him, if possible, and wherever he might prove, make him an example to all future traitors. To retain their strong hold, the cavern, however defensible it might be, was no object with our party, as their leader had already determined to leave it the following morning to proceed all the main purpose of their excursion, which was to break up an establishment of their opponents, who had obtained a strong foothold at the lower falls of Otter Creek, and to seize a York surveyor, locating lands in that vicinity—from which purpose they had only turned aside for a day or two to give others an opportunity to join them on the lake, the appointed rendezvous, and a pleasant spot for employing the interim in fishing and hunting. Accordingly it was soon concluded to make no regular defence of the cave, bat, using it only so far as might best favor them in their object of discomfiring the enemy, the modes of doing which were yet to be devised, leave it to their possession, and quit the place that night. Their game and such moveables as were not immediately wanted were therefore now transferred to the boat, which was removed to a secret landing, where the party were ordered to repair at the signal-call of the whistle. These brief arrangements having been completed, and the young Indian, who seemed to enter with great spirit into the enterprize, being employed to stand on the look-out, the company, with their loaded rifles by their sides, sat down to their sylvan meal, over which they discussed, in gleeful mood, the various and ingenious methods which were successively proposed for the reception and chastisement of their assailants, who were expected to make their appearance as soon as it was fairly dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. `Thus, spite of prayers her schemes pursuing, She went on still to work our ruin; Annul'd our charters of releases, And tore our title-deeds to pieces; Then sign'd her warrants of ejection, And gallows raised to stretch our necks on; And straitway sent, like dogs to bait us, Munroe, with posse comitatus.' Leaving our little band of Green Mountain Boys to discuss and settle the manner of receiving their expected visitors, and to make their dispositions for carrying such plan, as should be finally adopted, into effect, we will now change the scene a little, and, introducing the reader to those visitors themselves, accompany him and them to the scene of action. In a thickly wooded swamp, near the northern extremity of the lake before described, were assembled a group of ten men, awaiting the approach of darkness, which was already begining to settle in successive and fast increasing shades upon the low lands and glens along the foot of the mountain. They were all armed, though variously—some having muskets, some large pistols, and some only oaken cudgels. Apart from the rest stood their leader, a stern, rough looking personage, engaged in a low, earnest conversation with another individual, of the apparent age of twenty-five, whose dress and general demeanor seemed to forbid the conclusion that he was either a common follower, or one in any command; and yet, from the interest he manifested in the business in hand, it was evident he was in some way connected with the expedition. As the last named person 3* may occupy considerable space in our tale, we will pause to note his personal appearance more particularly: he was of about the middle height, well made, though of rather slight proportions. His features, though regular, were common-place and inexpressive, with the exception of a pair of small, twinkling black eyes, in which an observant spectator might often read meaning considerably at variance with the import of his language, his plausible manners, and the obsequious, smirking smile, which he usually assumed while addressing those with whom he had a point to carry. The construction of his head seemed to be somewhat peculiar—his forehead, which was very tall, being nearly in the shape of a triangle with the base resting on the eyebrows, and the sides narrowing to an apex at the hair above; while his head, as far back as the ears, swelling upwards into large protuberances, might be better represented by a triangle reversed. His dress was of a finer texture than that of any of his present associates, or that ordinarily worn by the settlers, and his whole appeareance, indeed, deno'ed some connexion with the more wealthy and fashionable classes of society. `You say, Sherwood,' observed the former of the two last mentioned persons, at that part of their dialogue which it concerns us to repeat: `you say that, from having been yourself at this cave, you know all the surrounding localities?' `Exactly—just as I described to you when I reached you last night. There can be no mistaking the place. They are still there, as is evident from the smoke which we saw rising over the spot just now, while passing the head of the lake. The path is now plain, and the came sure, without further guidance; so I think, as I began to suggest to your honor a few minutes ago, that you may now dispense with my further attendance. If I should be seen by any of their party I should be delicately situated here in the settlement.' `To the devil with your delicacy! Why, man, do you think I am going on in the dark, stumbling over logs and through bogs, without a guide? Even you are none too good a one for this cursed hole; but such as you are, in the king's name, I retain you; so not another word about quitting us till the scoundrels are secured.' `I am certainly aware, Mr. Munroe, of the importance of securing this Warrington, so great a disturber of the public peace, but—' `Disturber! doubly damned rebel! Why, no man in the settlement has caused me so much trouble, considering his audacious assault on me, and all. It will do me more good to see him hung than to sit at the king's banquet!' `O, certainly—it would me; and I would by all means aid you even to the capture, if your honor's well known sagacity and bravery on such occasions did not render my assistance wholly unnecessary.' `Well, well, Jake,' replied the Sheriff, relaxing a little from his wonted roughness at the flattering expressions of the other; `suppose I am all that you say, it won't serve me in finding a fox's hole in these woods any better than the instinct of any country booby, nor half so well. I tell you, Sherwood, you must conduct us to the place, at least; for we shall then have enough to do to take the fellow, and, what is worse, to get him through the settlement to Ticonderoga. Why, there is not an old woman in all the Grants but will fight for the scoundrel as if he was one of her own brats.' `O, there can be no great trouble, the surprize will be so great; but, as your honor desires it, I will go so far as to point out the place, on condition that I then be allowed to keep out of sight.' `Yes, but your half of the reward for taking the fellows, for you say that there is at least one outlaw besides Warrington: you won't claim all that unless you help us through the whole affair, will you?' `Your honor forgets that I was only to conduct you so far as to point out their retreat.' `Have it your own way, then—but I hate to see a fellow so keen on the chase, and then become so devilish prudent the moment he approaches the game,' grumbled Munroe, turning away to give some orders to his men, preparatory to resuming their march. It having now become sufficiently dark for their purpose, the party were put in motion for the prosecution of their enterprise. And after striking a light and procuring some materials for torches from the pine knots gathered in the surrounding windfalls, they set forward toward the place of their destination, then about a mile distant. Keeping as far from the shore of the lake as the nature of the ground would permit, lest the gleams of their light, striking across the water to the vicinity of the cave, should betray their approach, they pursued their way along the foot of the mountain with all possible silence and caution; while the glare of their torches, glittering on the points of the crags, and thrown back on to the dark forms, and eager and flushed visages of the party, gliding stealthily along in Indian file beneath the over hanging cliffs, like tigers for their prey, gave them a singularly wild and almost unearthly appearance. At length they arrived at a sharp knoll, which, running down from the main ridge above to the water, had so far screened their approach, and enabled them to advance with their lights unseen within a few hundred yards of the cavern. Here they made a brief halt to arrange their forces for the onset. As soon as this was effected, Munroe and Sherwood crept noiselessly over the intervening rise, followed at short intervals by the rest of the party, with the exception of one man left behind in charge of the torches. Having descended to the level beyond, they again paused to listen and reconnoiter before venturing any farther. All was dark and silent before them. And concluding that their intended victims had retired within the cave and were, probably, by this time, reposing in unsuspecting slumbers, they now congratulated themselves on a certain and easy conquest, and, with freshened impulse, once more began to move briskly forward; when the loud whoo! whoo! —whoo! whoo! of the `dismal bird of night,' or of something strikingly resembling it in note, proceeding from some point above, came pealing through the darkness with fearful distinctness to the ears of the company. All gave an involuntary start.— Even the stout-hearted Munroe, for the instant, could scarcely avoid quaking at the strangely dismal notes that thus broke from utter stillness so unexpectedly upon them. The next moment, however, as the consciousness of the insignificant cause of their affright came over them, a half stifled giggling ran through the company; while their leader muttering a dry `umph! scared at a damned owl!' motioned Sherwood to proceed. But the latter, more accustomed to the notes of the supposed animal, and thinking he detected something not quite natural in the sounds they had just heard, became secretly impressed with the fears of an ambush, and, without imparting his suspicions, he hastily pointed out to the sheriff the mouth of the cave, whose dim outlines had now become discernable, and, instantly returning to the rear, quickly retreated over the hill. With a few muttered expressions of contempt at the flight of the wary and timid guide, Munroe once more set forward with the determined motions of one who is resolved not again to be interrupted by any slight causes. And being now promptly followed by his men, he soon, and without further obstacle, arrived at the mouth of the cave, and, bringing up his forces, immediately surrounded it. Here they all paused, standing motionless and silent, listening long and intensely. Every thing within and around was as still as if no living being was within a mile of the place. `Hallo!' at length sharply uttered the Sheriff, after waiting till he began to doubt whether his anticipated captives had escaped, or were all snugly asleep in the cave, `hallo! within there!' `Hallo, without there!' was the ready reply from the cavern. `Ha! ye rebel dogs!' exultingly exclaimed Munroe; `you are there, are ye? We have kenneled ye at last, then. Now hear me—I command ye to surrender yourselves to the king's warrant, every scoundrel of ye—but first of all Charles Warrington—do you hear the summons?' `We hear the summons, and well comprehend its import,' coolly replied the voice from the cave, which was evidently that of the person especially named by the sheriff; `but touching your last demand, mine ancient friend—for in your voice I think I recognize the person with whom I once exchanged civilities in the southern part of our favored settlement—touching your last demand, I beg leave to observe, that being somewhat personally interested myself in the decision to be made in regard to the requirement, I would respectfully refer you to my friends here, who will doubtless give you such answer as their unbiassed judgments shall dictate.' `Do you think to dally with me, scoundrel?'— stormed Munroe, nettled at the provoking coolness of his antagonist, and especially at his ironical allusion to a personal chastisement received from his hands the year before; `such attempts will but little avail you, you'll find. Nor will it be of the least use, let me tell you all, to think of contending against our numbers: and the longer you hold out the worse it shall be for ye. So yield yourselves instantly, or, so help me Beelzebub, every dog of you shall swing for it.' `Assertions,' observed Selden, who, being Warrington's only companion in the cave, now took up the discourse on the hint of his superior; `assertions, sir Sheriff, sometimes unfortunately are more easily made than proved. You may not find us, perhaps, so entirely unprepared for your visit as you have expected, notwithstanding our warder thought fit, in his owl-like wisdom, to be somewhat tardy in announcing your approach. It may not be prudent in us, however, to speak wholly without reserve in this matter, as we know not how much aid your Honor may expect from the friend you last invoked.' The intimations which they gathered from these replies, together with the jeering calmness attending them, which seemed to imply a sense of security in the assailed from resources unknown to the assailants, considerably dampened the ardor of the Sheriff and his band; and they began to suspect that their triumphs might not prove so cheaply won as they had anticipated. The men, indeed, now began to show symptoms of fear and uneasiness at standing longer before the mouth of the cave, from which, for aught they could see or know, a dozen loaded rifles might be pointed against them; and their leader shouted loudly to the man left in the rear, directing him to come on with lights, and declaring at the same time with a tremendous oath, that if the stubborn rascals didn't instantly yield, he would send a volley of balls in among them, and if that failed, he would smoke them out like so many burroughed foxes. He was not allowed, however, much time to attempt the fulfilment of his menaces: for the Green Mountain Boys, two of whom only, as before mentioned, were in the cave, the rest being stationed in the nearest surrounding coverts, now deemed it time to begin their plan of operations. Suddenly a fearful screech, something between that of a man and a wild brute, isssuing from the thicket above the cave, resounded through the forest, sending its startling thrill to the very hearts of the appalled and astonished assailants.— All eyes were involuntarily turned upwards to the spot from which these terrific sounds seemed to proceed. `A catamount! a catamount!' wildly shouted several of the party. `Where? where?' eagerly exclaimed others. `There! up there in the fork of that tree!' hurriedly replied the former, pointing to the top of a leaning tree that projected nearly over the mouth of the cave, in a broad fork of which the outlines of a dark body, as if some large animal crouching for a leap upon his prey, with great fiery eye-balls glaring down upon them, was sufficiently discernable to justify their alarm. `He moves!' cried one, `hark! hear him fixing his claws in the bark! There, he stirs again! look out! he's going to leap down upon us—fire! quick, all hands, fire!' `Hold! hold!' shouted Munroe, the suspicion of a trick now for the first time flashing across his mind. But the command came too late; for while the words were in his mouth, every gun and pistol in the party, except his own, were discharged at the object of their terror, which was seen, in the expiring flash, to bound out from the tree directly over the place where they stood; and all, in their eagerness to avoid the clutches of the leaping animal, well known to be terrible when wounded, even if in the last agonies of death, broke away, and fled in confusion from the spot, wholly unmindful of their duty in guarding the mouth of the cave, and every thing else, but their own safety, in the general panic that had seized them. A momentary pause followed the explosion of the fire-arms, in which nothing was heard save the hasty scrambling of the terrified Yorkers in their eager efforts to escape. In an instant, however, a rushing from other quarters was heard—dark forms were seen swiftly gliding from the cave and the thickets above, in the direction of the retreating party, among whom, in a moment more, a cry of dismay rose wildly on the air. Munroe, and three of his men, were suddenly seized round their waists or legs, from behind, by the iron grasp of grappling arms, and, being lifted from the ground, were upborne with resistless force and rapidity towards the shore of the lake; all of them but their leader verily believing, in the fright and confusion of the moment, that it was the catamount, whose fearful image was still uppermost in their minds, that had seized them and was bearing them off in his grasp. 4 `Help! help, here! He has got me! for God's sake help me!' screamed one in an agony of terror. `Murder!' exclaimed another; `Oh! get him off —get him off! murder! murder!' `Oh! aw!' cried the third in a yell of despair;— `he has got his claws in my throat—he'll kill me— he will! he will! yah! yah!' Munroe alone, of all the thus oddly captured party, was mute. Rightly judging the character of the foe into whose hands he had fallen, and boiling with silent rage, he made the most desperate struggles to free himself from the vice like grasp of his captor, who, he at once concluded from his great strength, the effects of which he had before experienced, could be no other than Warrington. But wholly failing in this attempt, and finding himself still carried rapidly onward, he knew not to what destination, he next tried to disengage his dirk from its sheath, in which it was confined beneath the grappling arm of his opponent. Before succeeding in this, however, and while intent only on his murderous design, he was borne by his intended victim to the margin of the water, and, with a giant effort, hurled headlong over the bank. The loud splashing that succeeded told that he was now struggling in the embrace of a different, though not a much more comfortable, antagonist; while three more heavy plunges, following in irregular succession along the bank, still further announced that the vanquished sheriff was not without the company of a good share of his friends to console him in the discomforts of the new element, into which they all had been so suddenly and unexpectedly translated. The shrill notes of Warrington's signal whistle now sounded the preconcerted retreat. In a moment more the victorious party were assembled at the appointed landing—in another they were embarked; while their boat, by the strong push of the last man springing in, was sent, by the single impulse, so far into the lake as to put a safe distance between them and their foes, now beginning to rally, with cries of rage, on the shore. An uncontrolable peal of laughter, ending in three loud and lively cheers, now burst from the Green Mountain Boys, rending the welkin above, and startling the deep recesses of the surrounding forests with the triumphant shout. `The battle being over,' observed Warrington, after the noise of their merriment and exultation had measurably subsided; `let us now turn our attention to the wounded and missing.' `All whole of skin, I imagine,' said Selden; `though here is one, Smith, I believe it is, who comes from the fight, as near as I can discover, like the Benjaminite of the scripture just escaped from the Philistines, with head bare and garments rent.' `I must leave my old otter skin cap in their hands I 'spose,' coolly replied Smith; `I had to take it to finish off the catamount's head with; for I could'nt fix the fox-fire for the eyes into the end of that bundle of dry grass, that I made the body of, so as to look any how natural without it, and when I pushed the thing out of the crotch, as I stood behind the tree with my pole, I gave it such a hoist over into the bushes among the scared devils that 'twas out of the question to think of looking for the cap, and grabbing one of the scamps too. But as to my coat being tore here a little, I do'nt valley it a fraction, seeing as how the ragamuffin I hove into the lake got pretty well choaked to pay for it.' `Ah, you have done well, Smith,' said the leader; `all of you, indeed, have done nobly; but of that hereafter—one of our number I believe is missing—which is it?' `It is Pete Jones,' replied Brown. `And the Indian chap,' added Smith. `The Indian,' resumed Warrington, `after announcing the enemy for us by his admirable imitation of the owl, departed by himself, I presume.— As near as I could gather from him, he did not wish to be known as acting against the Yorkers.— He probably lives with some family in the vicinity who are trying to stand neutral in this warfare, and who have cautioned him to govern himself accordingly. His absence therefore does not surprise me. But what can have become of Jones? He surely is not a fellow to be easily ensnared, or over-powered.' `I rather suspect,' replied Brown; `he is after that traitor. As when the Yorkers were creeping on toward the cave he whispered to me he thought he saw a fellow pointing out the place, and slipping back over the hill, who, he guessed, was the one— and the last I saw of Pete, he was working off that way. Suppose, Captain, that we row along so as to stand off the shore in that direction, to be ready to take him in, should he give the word?' In pursuance of this prudent suggestion the boat was immediately headed round to the north, and rowed noislessly along the shore in the direction supposed to be taken by their missing companion. They had made but little progress, however, before they were startled by the sudden flash and sharp report of a pistol, in a thicket near the shore, about a furlong ahead. `There goes trouble for poor Jones, I fear,—the dastard has attempted his life!' cried Warrington, in the varying tones of fear for the result and indignation for the attempt; `but if help be of any further use to him, he shall have it. So, men, pull for it! pull for the spot with every nerve you have got, or the Yorkers will be there before us.' In an instant the canoe, almost leaping from its element at every stroke of the excited and strong armed oarsmen, was surging through the waters, with bird-like velocity toward the place. As Warrington had predicted, the enemy on shore, on hearing the report of the pistol, immediately started for this new scene of action. And, quickly perceiving their opponents on the lake making rapidly for the spot, they redoubled their speed, and rushed on as fast as the obstacles of the woods and the wet clothes and benumbed limbs of those who had been ducked, would permit, to arrive in time to assist, or rescue, as the case might require, their absent guide, whom they readily concluded to be an actor in the fracas, and revenge themselves, if possible, on the whole band of their foes, for the sad discomfiture just experienced. The race between the two contending parties was a close one. The Green Mountain Boys, however, were again in fortune. Their boat came whirling up to the shore, adjoining the scene of action, while the foremost of the enemy was yet fifty yards distant. `You may kick till all is blue,' muttered Jones, whose tall form at that instant came peering from the thicket, while with irregular motions he made toward the boat, bearing bolt upright in his arms before him his grappled foe, who was struggling with terrible violence, and kicking desperately 4* against every tree within reach of his feet, with the hope of retarding the progress of his captor till succour arrived; `you may kick, and be hanged! but you have jest got to go, my sweet lad, and into a little better company too than you hoped for, I guess. No help for it—so in with you—there!— now make yourself comfortable friend,' concluded the woodsman, pitching his captive headlong into the boat, and leaping in himself, just in time to escape the pursuers now close at his heels. `Escaped again, by the pains of tophet!' exclaimed the enraged Munroe from the bank, as the boat, previously headed round, shot out into the lake beyond the reach of the twice baffled Yorkers: `fire! fire! upon the damned rascals!' The command was scarcely uttered before Jones, having as quick as thought again grappled his captive, and faced round toward the shore, was holding the deprecating victim before him in the stern so as to cover the range of the expected volley. `Let drive there!' exclaimed Pete, with the utmost nonchalance, `you need'nt feel any delicacy, gentlemen, for I'll agree to take all the bullets you'll send through this beautiful target I'm holding for you.' `Dont fire! for God's sake dont let'em fire, Munroe!' screamed the struggling and terrified prisoner. `You need not be much alarmed I think, fellow:' said Warrington, `the sheriff's pistols must be rather too wet to be very dangerous; and as to the arms of the rest, which were all discharged at the catamount, we shall have but little to fear from them by the time they can be loaded.' `I mistrusted as much myself,' observed Jones, releasing the prisoner; `but I thought I would scare the fellow a little for his scurvy treatment to me.' `The pistol we heard, then, was meant, as we suspected, for you?' asked the leader. `O, yes,' replied the other carelessly; `to be sure he showed the best good will in the world to make a hole in me; but I should'nt have laid that up much, seeing he missed his aim, which is a sort of punishment of itself, you know, if he had'nt afterwards offered me money to let him go and keep his name and all close—why I never was so insulted in my life!' `His name? who is it? what is his name?' eagerly asked several of the company. `Mayhap, you from down south never heard of him, and don't know him, but I did, the moment I saw his face as he passed the fellow bringing the torch light. His name is Sherwood, living down in New Haven, and he is jest one of the smoothest fellows that ever wore two faces in a day, asking his pardon.' `Sherwood—Sherwood,' said Warrington musingly; `aha! I now remember to have heard of his having been at Bennington, and also of his having made some suspicious visits to Albany. But we will examine his merits more particularly when we reach the opposite shore.' `See how wishful those fellows are looking after us!' observed Jones, pointing back to the shore, now about fifty rods distant, where the Yorkers, having procured a light, were still standing in a dark group, evidently trying to trace the course of the receding boat; `I swan! if I was only bloody minded enough, how I would like to take a shot into that flock of York buzzards!' `Hold up a little, oarsmen,' said the leader; `and we will give them a kinder compliment than that, before entirely parting. `So good night, Mr. Munroe,' he continued rising in the boat, and raising his loud clear voice to a pitch, which, in the dead stillness of night, might have been distinctly audible to a far greater distance; `good night! my old friend —I hope for the pleasure of many such meetings and partings before we die—pleasant dreams and a good night to you!' `Good night, sir Sheriff,' added Selden, in the same strain of mock courtesy; `we humbly trust you will duly appreciate our late reception of yourself and fellows, in imitation of the much lauded oriental custom of regaling friends with the luxury of the cool bath, which, together with the honor done you of being carried, like other immortal heroes, on the shoulders of men, will make out an entertainment, we flatter ourselves, not wholly unworthy of our guests—good night!' `Halloo there, Sheriff!' cried Jones determined to have a parting shot as well as the rest; `halloo, Sheriff, wont you jest be kind enough to tell us by way of information, before we go, what kind of a return you calculate to make on that warrant you told us about. We should like grandly to see it when you have got it fixed. That 'tother poor bothered sheriff's non comeatibus in swampo, I guess, would be a fool to it.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “Ah, me! what perils do environ The man that meddles with cold iron— What plaguy mischiefs and mishaps Do dog him still with afterclaps.” Sherwood, the person we introduced in the last chapter, and left a prisoner in the hands of the Green Mountain Boys, a fair candidate for the honors of the Beech-seal, or some other of the novel and ingenious modes of punishment, which the settlers were accustomed to inflict on their foes with equal promptitude, whether they were foreign or domestic, was a resident of New Haven, in the vicinity of the lower falls of Otter Creek, then embraced within the limits of that town, but now forming the site of Vergennes, the only incorporated city of Vermont. He had here located himself, ostensively to become a permanent settler—to share the fortunes and identify himself with the interests of the New Hampshire grantees; while in fact he was a secret agent of a company of New York land-jobbers, in their pay, and himself engaged, at the same time, in speculating in the patents issued by the governor of the last named province. Through the influence of his father, a man of reputed wealth, living near Albany, he had been taken into the employment of this company. And they, soon finding him a person well fitted for their purposes, induced him, by opening to his avaricious mind the prospect of making a fortune out of the poor settlers of the New Hampshire Grants, in addition to the stated salary to be allowed him, to take a secret agency, and locate himself in some part of the settlement where he would most effectually subserve their interests.— In pursuance of this object it had been agreed that he should first proceed to New Hampshire, and, taking out a patent from that source, should enter Vermont known only as a grantee of that province, in order that he might thus be effectually secured from the hostility of the settlers, and enabled to maintain with them a free and unsuspected intercourse, which, at the present juncture, could alone insure him any success or safety. This had been accordingly done something more than a year previous to the events of our tale. A single lot of land had been purchased and located by him near the Otter, in the manner agreed on by the company. And so speciously had this wily agent conducted, beginning and carying on improvements just sufficient to save appearances, while mainly pursuing the objects of his residence in the settlement, that till now he had passed wholly unsuspected of being in the York interest, except in the slight question that had been raised concerning his true character, on account of his having been recognized by some settlers from the south part of the grants, as before intimated, while on one of his secret journeys to Albany. With these remarks, which will apprise the reader with all that may at present be necessary to be known respecting the previous character and employment of this personage, we will return to the thread of our narrative. Brightly rose the waning moon over the eastern mountains, which cast their broad, wood-fringed shadows far into the lake, while a flood of silvery light, falling on the sleeping waters and towering forest beyond, was gradually unfolding the bold and magnificent outlines of this wilderness landscape, as our victorious band of Green Mountain Boys merrily sped their way to the western shore. `What a glorious spectacle!' exclaimed Selden, looking abroad over the scene, as the boat emerged from the dark gloomy line of the mountain shadows into the bright and cheerful tract of illumined waters, that now met them on their course. `Splendid! splendid, indeed!' responded Warrington, with equal enthusiasm; `such scenes, one would think, were enough to enamor the whole world of a sylvan life.' `And yet,' observed Selden, `those city smoked exquisites, who claim all the taste and refinement of the country, are horrified at the thought of the life we here lead in the Green Mountains.' `I dont think the creturs are so much to be blamed for that,' said Pete Jones; `for bringing them here I calculate would be putting them pretty nearly in the plight of frogs that are dug from the bottom of a well—always sure to shiver and die the minute they are brought to the pure air.' `If all this be so,' rejoined Warrington, significantly glancing at the dress and comparatively delicate appearance of the prisoner; `I hope that such of this class, as are connected with a certain city to the west of us, will be less inclined to favor our settlement with their presence hereafter. Let them stick to their mode of life and its luxuries, and we will to our mountains. But I am reminded, Lieutenant,' he continued, turning gaily to Selden, `of the possibility of our being favored with something on this subject in a more agreeable form, if I rightly divined the nature of your employment, and the rheme that occupied your mind there at the fire before the cave last evening, after the rest of us had retired to our stone couches for the night. Can you oblige us with the fruits of your vigil, in the shape of a song?' `O, yes, such as it is—that is, if my music will not jar upon the feelings of our friend in durance here, and you are all willing to risk the same effect on yourselves,' jocosely replied the other, as he pulled from his pocket a small roll of white birch bark, (the soft, smooth inner surface of which he had made, as was in those times not unfrequently the case, his papyrus in noting down his hasty effusion,) and turning to the moonlight, commenced: In the courts of high life, and in Fashion's domain, Where Folly is licens'd by birth-right to reign, Let the gay idle throng, in their old reckless measure, Their phantoms still follow, and christen them pleasure. But we, who disdain not to follow the plough, And our livelihood gain by the sweat of the brow— What have we here to do with the fashions of cities? Their levees, theatricks and Opera ditties? What to do with the trappings around them display'd? Their half dress, their full dress, their dress promenade— Their turtle-soup dinners, their port and champaign, And knick-knacks unnumber'd that follow in train? All these we will leave, and without one regret, To the poor pamper'd wights of that butterfly set, And turn to our dainties, the fruits of our mountains, Our wines sparkling up in their health giving fonntains; And wear with just pride, as forever we ought, Our woollens and checks by our fire-sides wrought, While we scout from our country those exquisite goats Who measure their worth by the cloth of their coats. As the clear, melodious voice of the singer, floating free and wide over the hushed waters of the lake, died away in the distance, and while the shouts of applause, which greeted him at the close of his performance, (intended as was supposed, to hit off the York gentry, and the last couplet to apply to the prisoner in particular,) were yet echoing around, the boat of the elated Green Mountain Boys reached its destined landing. And immediately disembarking with their prisoner, they proceeded to a rude, bark-covered shantee, built by former visitors to the lake, and standing amidst a group of large evergreens a few rods from the water. There, after striking a light and kindling up a cheerful fire, they promptly set about the business of deciding upon the case of the supposed traitor. For this purpose they formally resolved themselves, as was usual in such cases where a resort could not readily be had to a committee of safety, into a sort of tribunal, very nearly resembling, we suppose, a modern Lynch court, a form of dispensing justice which, if ever justifiable, was undoubtedly so in the acts of our early settlers in resisting that system of legalized plunder attempted to be enforced on them by their oppressors. And if the right of defending their homes and possessions from unwarrantable seizures be conceded them, it was certainly not only justifiable but honorable in them to resort, as they did, to such measures as they judged most effectual in shielding from arrest and threatened punishment those of their fellow settlers, who, by their patriotism in the common cause, had rendered themselves obnoxious to the arbitrary enactments of the usurping government. For soon after the settlers had begun openly to resist the authorities of New York in 5 attempting to dispossess them, a law, more despotic perhaps than any to be found in the annals of legislation, had been enacted by the assembly of that province requiring some six or eight of the settlers, who had been most conspicuous in the controversy, to surrender themselves, on the order of the executive, within seventy days, to a magistrate for imprisonment, and in case of neglect to be adjudged convicted, and, without hearing or trial, condemned to suffer death. And not delivering themselves up, as might well be expected, the governor issued his proclamation proscribing them as felons, and offering large rewards for their apprehension, which, while it led to many secretly laid plots, and several open, though fruitless attempts to seize them by the Yorkers, in concert with a few traitorous settlers, served only to endear them to an indignant and aroused people, who publicly resolved to protect at every hazard their proscribed leaders, and, at the same time, prepare to defend the general interest of the settlement even at the price of their lives. Of this goodly company of outlaws, embracing some of the first and most talented men of the Grants, two, as before intimated, were among the band whom we have introduced to the reader, and to whom we will now return. Pete Jones, the principal witness in the case now to be decided, being called on for his testimony, related at large, and in his own vein of peculiar drollery, what he knew of the previous life and character of the person who, it appeared, had been frequently absent from home, though his excursions were generally undertaken under the profesed character of a sportsman, for the employments of which he pretended a great liking, but for what reason nobody could imagine, as it never could be ascertained that he was ever successful. It also appeared that he had been loud in his denunciations against the Yorkers, and, as far as words could go, a great stickler for the rights of the settlers. The witness then related all the particulars of his detecting and capturing the prisoner. After this, the accused was requested to make his defence; when, to the surprise of all, he wholly denied any hostile intention, or any willing participation in the recent attempt of Munroe to surprise and seize the present party at the cave, deliberately stating, that while hunting in the woods near the creek that afternoon, he was met, made prisoner by the Yorkers, and compelled to accompany them on their expedition, the object of which they did not reveal to him. And in confirmation of the truth of his statements and of his asserted inocence, he cited the general character he had always sustained as a friend of the settlers. `Do you generally manifest your friendship for the settlers by firing pistols at their heads, sir?' asked Warrington, casting a look of withering contempt on the prisoner. `O, I was trying to escape,' replied Sherwood, who had his ready answer to a question he had anticipated; `I was on the point of escaping, and discharged my pistol at this man, who beset me, to prevent being retaken, supposing him all the while to be one of the Yorkers.' `Whew!' uttered Jones with a whistle, prolonged into an exclamation; `now, honestly, friend, I must crave leave to tell you—but that would'nt be manners, and so I wont—though I should really like to ask you, if there was any one Yorker there to-night that a fellow of my short stature—only six foot eleven, in shirt flaps—could be taken for with any sort of conscience?' `Yes, in the dark.' `But you may remember, possibly, friend, that you had to raise your pistol considerably higher than your head to get aim at mine, which you seemed to fancy shooting at in preference. Besides that, we took what I call a fair measure of lengths on the ground in the bit of grapple we had afterwards —now most folks that I am acquainted with can feel in the dark, if they can't see.' `O, I was so confused and frightened, that I noticed none of these circumstances, but really supposed it was one of the Yorkers till you had got with me nearly to the boat.' `Well, now,' exclaimed Pete, dropping his head in affected chagrin; `I vow to Jeremiah, I never felt so mortified in my life! To be taken for a Yorker! only think of that!' `A sad mistake, truly,' observed Selden, addressing his companions, while in a side glance he kept an eye keenly fixed on the prisoner; `but still it was scarcely a more singular one than I made as we struck a light just now, when, turning to look at this man, I could have sworn he was the identical fellow we detected skulking about the shore yesterday—the make, motion and dress of the two being so very similar.' `That's false!' hastily exclaimed Sherwood, completely thrown off his guard by the round about way, and designedly incorrect statement of the other, made for the purpose of seeing its effect on the prisoner; `that's false, for this was not the dress I wore yest'—and he stopped short in visible confusion at the thought of the admission he was inadvertently making; while meaning and triumphant glances were exchanged among the company. Soon recovering in some degree his self possession, however, and seeing how he had been entrapped, he attempted to mend the matter by explaining that he was about to say that this was not the dress he wore yesterday, even had he been here, instead of a dozen miles off, as he was, and could prove, as well as his innocence of all the charges brought against him, if time were but allowed him for the purpose. And this, or his acquittal, he continued for some time to demand, becoming, however, every moment less assured in his tone, and more abject in his manner, as he stealthily glanced round and read his doom in the countenances of his judges. `Well, gentlemen,' said the leader, breaking the brief interval of silence, which followed the last somewhat broken and confused remarks of the accused; `you have heard the evidence against the prisoner, as well as his defence and avowals of innocence. Will you offer your individual opinions on the question of his guilt? And we will first hear what you may have to offer on the subject, Mr. Jones?' `Why, I dont know exactly about the chap, Captain,' said the latter, with a mischievous cocking of one eye, while screwing up his mouth nearly to the ear on the opposite side of his face; `he says he is innocent of the traitor, and it is a poor story if he do'nt know. But I have two other charges against him, which I consider rather gravus. Firstly, according to his own story, he suffered himself, with that clean pair of legs of his, and the woods open for a run, if he chose that, or with gun and pistols if he chose to stand and fight—(now while 5* I think on't I wonder what become of his gun)—he suffered himself, I say, to be taken by the Yorkers in a way and manner which is a burning shame to a Green Mountain Boy, if so be he is one as he pretends. And secondly he missed his aim when he levelled at my head, for which a professed hunter like himself ought to be ridiculous. So I think, considering, I shall vote to have him viewed.[1] [1] A cant phrase among the settlers, signifying the punishing of offenders. ' `And you, Smith, what is your verdict? `My opinion is,' answered the man now addresssed, `that the fellow's plausible palaver is all nothing but a made up mess to bamboozle us with—I should like to know how the Yorkers knew how we were here on the lake, or how they happened to find the cave without his help. The fact is, he brought them here to seize us, and was probably calculating to see some of us swinging on a York gallows within a week. My verdict, therefore, will be pretty much such a one as the king gave Haman.' `And what say you, Brown?' `Guilty! guilty as a dog, and the liar knows it.' `And lastly your opinion, Mr. Selden?' `Briefly told—that the fellow's guilt is equalled only by his effrontery. And yet, as this is his first known offence, I would recommend a milder punishment than the one which has been hinted at.' `We are unanimous, then, in a verdict, gentlement,' observed the chief, `if I understand your various modes of expressing your opinions. And it remains only to determine in what manner the prisoner shall be punished for his offence. You are all, including the prisoner himself, I presume, well aware that, by a decree of our Convention, the only source of law we feel ourselves bound to regard in cases of this kind, the crime of aiding the enemy to arrest one of our citizens, who may have happened to fall under the ban of that despotic edict by which they would terrify us into submission, is made punishable with death. If this were to be inflicted, however, on the prisoner, I should be inclined to grant him a more formal trial, before a regularly appointed committee of safety, and allow him time for his defence, as he requests—not that I have the least doubt of his guilt, for I believe him to be the most precious compound of duplicity and villany that I have seen in the settlement, but I would grant it on the principle of allowing every man the best means to establish his innocence when his life is at stake. Yet, concurring with Mr. Selden, I think we had better adopt one of the ordinary modes of punishment, for which the evidence is abundantly sufficient, administer it on the spot, and dismiss him with the admonition it will give. What this punishment shall be I will leave to you to designate.' `I should like to have the title of my farm confirmed,' said Smith, `seeing the Yorkers still continue to dispute it, and as the Beech Seal is a sort of legal instrument to do it with, they say, I vote that we apply it.' `Just the thing for the double faced scoundrel, if we have got to let him off so cheap,' bluntly remarked Brown. `My title to my head,' said Pete Jones; `seems to be rather questioned, and as it is an article that would be dreadful inconvenient for me to be without, I motion that it be confirmed too.' `So be it, then,' observed Selden; `I had, it is true, thought of a ducking, that he might be enabled to sympathise with his friends over the lake—I also had thought of taking him up into the top of one of these trees, and leaving him bound there for the night; but neither of these punishments, probably, would so nearly come up to the fellow's merits as the beechen remedy. I will therefore agree to its application.' The prisoner's doom being thus unanimously settled, preparations were immediately commenced for carrying the sentence into effect. This was understood to be, in the quaint phrase of the times, “a chastisement with the twigs of the wilderness,” or the usual number of stripes, forty, save one, faithfully applied to the back of the offender with a green beech rod, termed, as before mentioned, the Beech-seal. Several rods, or shoots of that thus oddly consecrated tree, were accordingly selected, cut and carefully trimmed for the purpose. The prisoner was, then, in despite of his alternate threats, and promises of good behaviour in future, stripped of his coat, and firmly bound to the body of a large hemlock, with his face turned to the tree. Every thing being now in readiness for the execution of the sentence, the question arose who should be the executioner. For this honor two rival candidates now presented themselves—Brown and Pete Jones —the former claiming it on the ground that no one of the present company had received injuries that so loudly demanded a personal reciprocation as his own, and the latter, with the greatest apparent gravity, contending that it was his peculiar right to do the duty of punishing the fellow for the unpardonable crime of missing his aim, since the shot was intended for his own benefit. The altercation, however, was settled by the interposition of their leader, who good naturedly awarded a division of the honors between them, directing that the first twenty stripes should be applied by Jones, while Brown should be allowed the privilege of completing the task. In accordance with this arrangement, the tall woodsman now seized a rod of his own preparing, of dimensions fearfully portentous to the back of the trembling culprit, and giving it a furious flourish in the air, he commenced, with a look of terrible fierceness, the performance of his allotted task. But malice and revenge formed no part of the character of this jolly and good natured borderer. The manner in which the blows were given, and the comparatively slight effect they produced on their victim, made it very evident, that, notwithstanding all his assumed wrath and fury of countenance and manner, his humanity, combined with a natural love of sport, which had doubtless led him to solicit the office, was about to govern him in its execution. `Well, here is my respects to you, friend,' he said, commencing and keeping up a sort of loose, irregular discourse, and counting the blows in a parenthetical tone, as, with mighty grins and flourishes, he proceeded to apply the typical beech; `there is my respects to you, (one,) miss your aim again, you lubber, eh? (two,) I told you that you should'nt disgrace the cloth for nothing, (three,) and then (four,) those kicks, (five,) I thought at the time (six,) that you was kicking against the pricks, (seven, eight,) so here is two pricks to every kick, (eight, nine,) scurvy business that of you, friend, (nine, ten,) that kicking against the trees (eleven, twelve,) you did'nt consider (seven—no, eleven,) what a hurry I was in, (twelve, thirteen) and then again that offering me money, zounds, sir! (thirteen, fourteen,) I should like (fourteen) to know, sir'— `There! there!' hastily exclaimed the prisoner, who had not been so much hurt amidst all this parade of cuts and flourishes as to prevent his taking note of the true number of the stripes which had been administered, and which the mischief loving woodsman had wilfully miscounted; `hold—you have already struck twenty—hold! I say.' `You dont say so?' replied Jones with affected surprise as he slowly lowered his uplifted arm; `why I thought I said fourteen—only fourteen last!' `I care not if you did, sir,' expostulated the prisoner, now bold from the consciousness of having at last a little truth on his side; `you miscounted on purpose to prolong my torture—I appeal to the company—you have gone your twenty, I tell you, ruffian!' `Have! well, friend, just as you say, not as I care.' So saying, the eccentric but kind hearted woodsman hurled his rod into the lake, and, bounding off into the woods, with the pretended object of procuring some better rods for the use of his successor, but in reality only to avoid the sight and sounds which, from the determined character, and exasperated feelings of the man, he rightly anticipated would now follow, disappeared, with a finger thrust into each ear, in a neighboring thicket. The flagellation was now resumed. And never was rod more effectually applied to the deserving back of a miscreant spy or traitor than now by the sinewey arm of Brown, doubly nerved as it was by the keen sense he harbored of the injuries he had already received from the hands of those with whom the present victim of his pent vengeance had been found leagued, to assist in dragging him to a gallows, and thus completing, on his person, that work of destruction which they had before commenced on his property. With a pause at every application of the rod, that no energy should be lost or weakened by the exertion, slow and measured fell the tremendous blows from his relentless arm, till he had told out the full number assigned him; while at every lash of the pliant and close hugging instrument of torture, the writhing victim sent forth a screech of agony that thrilled through the forest for miles around him. This painful task being performed—for painful it was to most of the band, while the stern necessity that required it was sincerely regretted by them all —the prisoner was unbound, and with an earnest but kind admonition from Warrington to profit by the lesson he had received, set at liberty; when, muttering many a bitter execration, and breathing vows of deadliest revenge on his captors, he sullenly departed from the camp, and soon disappeared along the border of the lake in a northern direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “That strain again! it had a dying fall! Oh, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odor.” After the departure of Sherwood, our band, not deeming it prudent, without precautions which must necessarily deprive most of them of their rest for the night, to encamp so near an exasperated enemy of double their own numbers, determined on an immediate removal from the scene of their recent exploits. Accordingly they packed up, and, without further delay, commenced their march by the beautiful moonlight, which, streaming brightly through the leafless forest, enabled them to pursue their way with as much ease and certainty as by the broadest day light. Striking off westerly from the lake they directed their course to the nearest part of Otter Creek, where they proposed procuring quarters for the remainder of the night in the log houses of the only two families who resided on the creek in that vicinity. These two houses were situated nearly a mile apart, while the respective openings around them were separated by a dense wood of evergreens of about half that distance in extent. After proceeding on together awhile, the company separated into two parties, three of them bending their course toward the lowest, or more northerly opening, where they were to remain till joined in the morning by their leader to conduct them on their enterprise down the creek; while the latter, with Selden, taking their venison and a goodly portion of their trout, continued forward directly to the upper clearing. This last was no other than the residence of the fair and spirited friend, whose timely notice had not only ensured their late escape, but enabled them to gain such triumphant advantages over their foes. And it was this friendly and patriotic act which they were now proceeding to reward, not only with suitable acknowledgment, but with the most valuable portion of their game—an offering that they supposed would be highly acceptable to one in her situation: for this extraordinary woman, with no other dependence than on her own hands, with the slight assistance rendered her by her boys, the eldest of whom was not a dozen years old, was managing to support herself and her large family of children from the products of a new lot of land, which her husband had commenced clearing when he lost his life by the fall of a tree, and which she now, with unexampled fortitude, persisted in improving, though in the heart of a wilderness infested with wild beasts, and not wholly exempt from the hostile, or at least predatory, incursions of the Indians. It was nearly midnight when Warrington and his companion reached the log tenement of this fearless daughter of the wilds. Much to their surprise they found the house entirely deserted. Finding the door unfastened, however, they determined on entering to note appearances within; when it became evident that the desertion had taken place but a few hours before; but whether it was intended for a temporary, or final removal, they were unable to determine. A bed of coals, yet alive, was raked up on the hearth; while the beds had been taken from the steads, and, with all the most necessary 6 utensils of family use, removed from the house. What means this sudden desertion of the family,' observed Warrington musingly; `and whither can they have fled?' `To their neighbor's, down the creek, probably,' replied Selden; `the movement has been made, I should conjecture, in anticipation of the return of Munroe and his party, from whose visit to-night alone woman, like this widow, would doubtless wish to be excused.' `It may be so,' rejoined the other; `but to quit her home from any of the motives which you suggest would be very little like widow Story: there are few men in the settlement who can handle, not only axe, but rifle, with more effect, though woman she be. And as for fear, it is a sensation with which, I verily believe, she is utterly unacquainted. But whatever may have become of the occupants of the house, we may as well, now we are here, make free and remain for the night.' `It will be considered no intrusion, I suppose?' enquiringly said Selden; `I have not the honor of an acquaintance with your heroine, you will bear in mind.' `Intrusion? not in the least; for you must know that we are patriots here,—rebels, or whatever we were, on the lake to-night,' jocosely replied Warrington. `Patriotism,' said Selden, following up the train of thought which the last remark suggested, `would seem entirely a relative term, and, like beauty, which consists of black teeth, thick lips and large eyes, with one nation, and exactly the reverse with another, wholly dependent on the pre-existing opinions of those who claim it for this action, and deny it in that. Besides this, as the world estimate actions, success would seem to be quite as essential to constitute the patriot as the merits of his cause or the glory of his deeds. Here with the settlers, you are indeed called a patriot, and surely there is no one who better deserves from them the appellation; while with the people of New York, you are a rebel, outlaw, and hunted like a wild beast. And yet if our cause prove successful, as heaven grant it may, the world at large, coming in as umpire, will side with the settlers in establishing your name as a patriot, but if we fail, it will join with your foes in declaring you a rebel and reckless factionist.' `Names and definitions, Selden, may be sometimes vague and varying, but principles are immutable. The principles which actuate us in resisting these encroachments on our rights are the same that have animated the bosoms of all those whom the world agree in calling patriots, from the beginning of oppression to the present time. The disposition to defend our homes and property, besides being implanted in our bosoms as a law of our nature, indispensable to our self protection, and even existence, in the world, seems to have been ordained by providence also as the natural means by which the rapacity of tyrants should be punished. This, indeed, is the only protection ensured to industry and virtue—it constitutes the grand cement of society and the main pillars of all government. This is the foundation of patriotism, which consists only in the defence of justly acquired rights against wrongful aggressions. In our case, the opinions of the world may indeed be various and fluctuating till our rights become fairly understood, and the wrongs we have received as fairly developed. But should men of the intelligence to know, and the spirit to defend their rights, stand tamely still, and see those rights wrested from them, to be placed forever beyond their recovery, while hesitating to know whether the world will call their resistance patriotism or rebellion? It is not the name of patriot that I seek, or that of rebel or outlaw that I fear. It is results I am aiming to accomplish, and I will never rest, nor cease my exertions, till our heaven-favored cause shall triumph, and these rapacicus intruders shall be driven from our soil. Could you have witnessed, as I have, the dismay, want and suffering, which these grasping and shameless tyrants have occasioned in this settlement—here, whole families turned from their houses in the midst of winter, with no human habitation within miles of them to flee to for refuge and shelter—there, property, acquired through the severest of toil, hardship and privation, wantonly destroyed, houses set on fire and consumed to prevent the return of the owners—and then again, females abused, and even the sick roughly ejected, and left to perish miserably in the night air, or storm, for all these ruthless aggressors could know—could you have witnessed all this, you would not be surprised at the exasperated feelings of our people, or the indomitable spirit with which they have persevered in that cause, which brought you, till lately a stranger to our wrongs, among us to aid in sustaining. My personal interest, I know, suffers in consequence of devoting so much of my time to the service of the public. Indeed, I have, in common with my chivalrous superior, colonel Ethan Allen, almost wholly neglected my own concerns, while guarding the interests of others. Even now I am the owner of a large tract of land on the borders of Champlain, a part of which, as I have lately been apprised, has been for several years in possession of one of the York patentees, while my duties nearer home have prevented me from ever looking after it, or taking, since making this discovery, any steps toward dispossessing the intruder.' `But you surely will neglect it no longer,' observed the other; `since we are going into the vicinity, and on similar business?' `We will consider the case after we have righted the wrongs of the houseless settlers at the Lower Falls, and fulfilled the other objects of our mission into this region. But let us drop this exciting subject for to-night, that we may obtain a little rest to prepare us for the duties of to-morrow,' replied Warrington, now rising to make such scanty preparations as might be required for their repose. The two friends, after barricading the door, and spreading their blankets before the small fire they had kindled on entering the house, now laid down to repose on the floor, which to the hardy and tired woodsman is generally more grateful than beds of the softest down to the pampered sons of luxury and ease. Selden was soon lost in slumber. But his companion, whose mind was oppressed with more weighty cares, and whose feelings had become somewhat excited in recounting the wrongs of his countrymen, courted the drowsy god in vain.— And these causes, together with his attempts to account for the absence of the family, for whose safety he was not wholly without apprehensions, continuing for some time to render all his endeavors to sleep useless, he arose, unbarred the door, and, without waking his more fortunate companion, went out into the open air to try the effect of the cool 6* breath of heaven in allaying the excitement of his feelings and disposing him to slumber. The night still continued bright and lovely. Abroad, nature seemed sunk in death-like repose; while the deep and solemn silence that pervaded the wilderness was broken only by the low, but far sounding hoot of the sylvan watchman of the night, or the voices of the inhabitants of the neighboring pools, who were straining their tiny throats in notes of seeming joy and jubilee at their recent release from a wintry thraldom. While contemplating the scene around him, and indulging in the moody reverie which the circumstances were calculated to create in the mind, the young outlaw unconsciously wandered nearly to the bank of the river, which was still bordered by a strip of forest, extending from the water back almost to the house. Here leaning against the trunk of a large tree, which some heavy wind had broken off about twenty feet from the ground, he stood some minutes looking listlessly down upon the placid waters, as, sparkling in the moonlight that struggled through the trees above, they moved ceaselessly along on their journey to the deep. Now his attention would become riveted for a moment on some light float of wood sweeping by in the noiseless current. And now he would turn a half listening ear to the sportive plunges of the Otter, here once found in such numbers as to have naturally suggested to the hunters who first visited this stream the name which it bears. His meditations, however, were at length interrupted by some indistinct, and at first scarcely audible sounds, the nature of which he was for some time wholly unable to determine. At last, however, he became satisfied it could be no other than the distant murmur of human voices; but from what quarter it came he was still unable to decide. He listened intently; and now the sounds became more distinct. Presently they began to swell on the air in the low, melodious voice of a female chanting a tune, which, though not recently heard by him, struck nevertheless familiarly on his ear, awakening in his mind reminiscences of persons, time and place, which formerly occupied a prominent space among the objects of his peculiar interest, but which, in the cares and turmoils of the last few years, had been almost forgotten. Starting as from a trance, he rallied his doubting senses, and made another effort to ascertain whence this mysterious music could proceed, but with no better success than before. Sometimes the sounds seemed to come from the earth, or some subterraneous cavern far beneath his feet. At other times the liquid notes appeared floating high in the heavens above. He now took another position, several paces distant from the one first occupied, to see whether any variation would thus be produced in the sounds. Here, however, they were scarcely audible. Several other new positions were then tried, but all with the same success; and he returned to the tree where he was standing when his attention was first arrested by these unaccountable sounds. Here he again tasked his powers of hearing to their utmost, when, to his increasing wonder, the same melodious notes fell upon his ear even more distinctly than before. Now, not only the tune seemed familiar to him, but there was something in the voice likewise which his bewildered senses seemed to recognize—something that seemed to touch a chord in his bosom that had never vibrated save under the sweet intonations of one whose words even were once music to his ears—but still one, to heighten his perplexity, who, though her residence had long been unknown to him, could not yet be, he felt assured, within a hundred miles of this spot. Curiosity, surprise and wonder had now raised his feelings to a pitch of almost frantic excitement. And, without scarcely knowing why, he struck his clenched fist two or three times heavily against the tree, which seemed so strangely the conductor of the sounds in question. A deep, hollow reverberation, indicating a large and extended cavity within, was apparently the only effect produced by the blows. On applying his ear once more, however, he found that the singing had ceased; and every sound was now hushed in silence. He listened awhile with suspended breath, in expectation of hearing the music resumed. But he listened in vain. He then renewed the experiment of listening from other positions; but being again unsuccessful, he returned to the tree, and fell to beating it again, in the absurd fancy that, if there had been any connection between his blows and the ceasing of the sounds, the same operation which had caused them to cease might revive them, though deeming it, at the same time, an utter impossibility that the cavity within the trunk could contain the invisible songstress. All his efforts, however, to gain a clue to the mystery proved wholly fruitless, and, after lingering some time near this spot of seeming enchantment, he slowly wandered back to the house, deeply pondering over the singular and incomprehensible incident which had attended his nocturnal ramble. Was it within the bounds of possibility, he asked himself, that the person, the once loved and lost one, whose voice these mysterious notes so much resembled, could now be in this almost uninhabited wilderness? No, no! What other female, then, capable of such execution, could be near at such an hour of the night? Surely none! Was it not then a human voice that he had heard?—was it the voice of an angel, of `visits few and far between,' floating high in the heavens, and hymning the stars? What had he done to deserve such special revealment? Or was it, as the traditions of the superstitious would inculcate, the voice of a departing spirit, permitted to break on the ear of a distant friend at the instant of departure, for the purpose of apprising him of its exit from earth, or warning him of his own dissolution? Or was it not far more probable, he said, with an effort to shake off these intruding fancies, that his senses had deceived him; and that, after all, the whole was but the work of an over-excited imagination? It must have been so. And, as if determined to satisfy himself with this last solution of the subject, since he could hit upon no other which reason would not sooner reject, he quickened his pace, and, like one resolved to end a perplexing enquiry by the best argument he can give, and call it conclusive, bustled forward, now whistling a tune, or now affecting to run over to himself the intended business of to-morrow, till he had reached the house, secured the door, and thrown hinself down beside his still insensible companion, when exhausted nature soon closed the scene in a profound slumber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “If you had been the wife of Hercules, Six of his labors you'd have done, and sav'd Your husband so much sweat.” Coriolanus. Real causes of excitement have frequently, and perhaps generally, been found to produce the soundest slumber; while those that are artificial, or imaginary, have an equal tendency to prevent it, Doctor Young's poetic philosophy to the contrary notwithstanding. It was thus with Warrington: While the images of the past and future, which fancy had called up, were operating in his bosom, he vainly sought the arms of `tired nature's sweet restorer.' But after he had found a just cause for excitement, and experienced the utmost of its legitimate effects, that restorer came unbidden and instantly. And the next morning was considerably advanced before he and his companion awoke from the deep and sense-absorbing slumbers which for many hours had sealed their every faculty in blank oblivion. They simultaneously arose, and went to the window to ascertain from whom proceeded the noise of the axe, whose heavy resounding blows in the adjoining forest had first awakened them from their quiet repose. At the border of the woods, a short distance to the south of the house, and in plain sight of their loop-hole, for the window was nothing more, stood the amazon owner, and almost sole creator of this little opening in the dark wilderness, plying her axe, with masculine dexterity and effect, into the huge trunk of a standing hemlock. In a short time this princely tenant of the Green Mountain forest began to tremble, totter and bow beneath the supple arm of its life-sapping foe, and at length came down with a thundering crash upon the ground, filling the air around with a cloud of dust, splinters, broken and powdered limbs, and causing the earth and surrounding woods to rebound at the shock.— When the obstructing cloud had cleard away from the spot, our observant friends beheld the object of their attention mounted on the trunk of the prostrate tree, and proceeding to mark it off into such lengths for chopping as suited her purpose. While thus engaged, her attention seemed to be suddenly arrested by something she observed about the house, or in a line with it beyond. Hastily descending from her stand on the trunk, and seizing her rifle, which stood at the foot of a tree near the stump of the one just felled, she approached with a rapid step, and with some appearance of concern, till within a few rods of the house, when she slackened her pace and soon halted. `Tall, stout and stately,' said Selden, still standing with his friend so near the window as to have a fair view of the person of their hostess; `tall, stout and stately,' he repeated, running his admiring eye over her erect and imposing figure; `face and features even yet handsome, despite the ravages and cares of forty! And then that queenly port!— Heavens! what a specimen of Eve's daughters!— Surely, Warrington, she must be the very Juno of your Green Mountains! But why not unbar the door and go out to meet her? We shall appear a pretty brace of heroes, if she come here and find us hid up like a couple of runaways! She has perceived us, I presume, but is doubtful whether we are friends or foes.' `Stay a moment,' said the other, who had been regarding the movements of the woman quite as intensely as his friend, though for different purposes; `I suspect you will soon see that other objects than ourselves are engrossing her attention.' Scarcely had the last speaker ceased, when they caught an oblique view of the approaching forms of a number of men, whom they instantly recognized to be Munroe and his party. Hastily retreating from the window, and preparing their arms for action, should their use become necessary either for defending themselves within the house, or protecting their hostess without, our two friends took positions at small apertures between the logs of the wall, where, without revealing themselves, they could easily observe their foes, and stood silently watching the progress of events in the yard.— Meanwhile the hardy widow had planted herself directly in the path in which the Yorkers were approaching from the main road to her door. And now boldly advancing and confronting them, she demanded what might be their object in turning into a lone woman's dwelling. `Why, my good woman,' said the sheriff, pausing and hesitating in evident surprise at the commanding appearance and determined tone of the person he was addressing; `we are all as hungry as so many kites, after the long morning's march we have had—and now can't you contrive to work up something in the shape of a breakfast for us?' `I know of but two reasons, sir, why I may not comply with your request,' replied the woman, with an air of quiet scorn. `And what may they be, woman?' asked Munroe; in doubt as to the drift of her discourse. `The lack of means, and the lack of inclination, sir,' rejoined the other in the same calm and scornful manner. `Short and sweet,' said Munroe; `but I think we can remove your objections easily enough, mistress—my men here have a plenty of salt junk, and some bread, which will make out the main materials for a meal—so you will have nothing to do but cook and serve up for us, and if we pay you well for your trouble, this will cure both your objections at once I suppose.' `Think you, sir, I would be hired to serve a Yorker of your stamp?' replied the woman, with increasing disdain; `why, the money got in that manner would burn through my pockets as quick as if it came at the call of one in league with the arch fiend, and all hissing hot from the burning mint in the regions below! Even the very food bought with it would stick my throat, and poison my children to death in the eating.' `Tut, tut! madam madcap!' exclaimed the sheriff, resuming his wonted roughness, and now begining to chafe under the biting sarcasms of the other; `you show about as much of the Tartar as any thing I have met with in my travels for a long while. I wish the rebels much joy in their petticoat champion! But it is time to look a little to such as you. The authorities of the king are neither to be resisted, nor insulted with impunity, you will do well to bear in mind, perhaps.' `Cowards are always allowed the privilege of blustering before women,' tartly rejoined the other; `your threats, valient sheriff, will hurt me about as 7 much, probably, as they frighten me, and if any thing further is attempted, you will find I can defend myself.' `We will see, my trooper!' muttered Munroe, making a sudden movement towards the other, apparently to disarm or seize her. Eluding his grasp and hastily retreating a few steps, the fearless woman cocked her rifle and brought it to her shoulder. `Another step towards me, sir, and your blood be on your own head,' she cried, in a cool, determined tone. `Hang me!' exclaimed Munroe, after standing a moment in mute surprise at this bold and unexpected movement of the woman, who, he began to suspect, could scarcely have been brought to show such singular fearlesness, but from a knowledge that help was near; `hang me, if I don't believe the termagant is standing guard to some of these skulking outlaws, whom she has concealed in the house!— We must see to this immediately,' he continued, moving round his opponent toward the house, and beckoning his men to follow. `O, is that all you want,' said the widow, taking her piece in her hand, and moving aside with the air of one relieved from a personal fear; `you are welcome to all the outlaws you will find here, but you must beware how you attempt to touch me.— However, you had better look out for yourself, brave sheriff,' she added in a sneering laugh; `take care, sir, that some of those terrible Green Mountain Boys concealed within there, don't blow you through the head with their rifles!' `The door is fastened, woman,' said Munroe, as, stepping up, he tried in vain to open it; `the door is fastened on the inside—see that it is opened, or I will force it!' `O, no, no! why, you would spoil my door, man!' cried the widow, with the utmost apparent concern for the safety of her door; `yes, ruin it entirely—'twould cost me a hard dollar to get it mended. I forgot to tell you it was barred up inside.— We do not stay here nights for fear of the visits of such strolling gentry as yourselves. But if you really wish to handle over my greasy pots and kettles, or crawl under my beds, you can go in as I came out, by going up on the ends of the logs at the corner yonder, and removing a piece of that bark roof.' `But honestly, woman, have you seen nothing of Warrington and his band this way last night, or this morning?' asked the sheriff, his suspicions seeming to be pretty much allayed by the well managed demeanor and conduct of the other. `Warrington—Warrington,' said she musingly, as if attempting to recal the name of one of whom she might have perhaps heard; `not captain Warrington? Yes, I have heard of him, I am sure. Is he in this section? Where is he? I should like to see that brave fellow. Why, he was the one that so handsomely beeeh-sealed one of the York authorities, down Bennington way last year—now what was his name—I will think in a minute'— `O, no matter, no matter,' hastily interrupted the sheriff, unwilling that the story of his own former discomfiture should be made known to his present followers; `come, boys,' he continued, moving away from the house and calling to his men; `we shan't be able to make any thing of this crabstick of a woman—so we may as well be on the move again, and as we have lost our guide, instead of going back through the woods, we will up the creek to the ford, and then down the military road to Ticonderoga.' `Adroitly done, by heavens!' exclaimed Selden to his companion, as the sounds of the retreating footsteps of their foes died away on their ears;— `the woman's tact has saved us, to say the least, Captain, from a troublesome contest. But shall I now unbar the door?' `No—let her continue to manage in her own way,' replied the other; `the Yorkers may take it into their heads to stop and reconnoiter the house awhile from the woods. And she may deem it prudent to guard against their making any discoveries in that way by remaining awhile without, or by entering the house in the manner she pointed out to Munroe.' The woodswoman, if the term be admissible, wary as she was fearless, immediately adopted one of the precautions anticipated by Warrington. And the sheriff and his posse had no sooner fairly disappeared in the forest than our friends heard her mounting the house, removing one of the broad pieces of spruce bark, which constituted the rude covering of the roof, and descending into the chamber or garret above them. In another moment she stood before them with a countenance animated with a look, of triumph and a smile of congratulation. `Now a thousand thanks to mistress Story,' warmly exclaimed Warrington, after presenting his friend and exchanging the ordinary salutations; `a thousand thanks not only for yesterday's timely notice, but for the shield which a woman's tact only could have so successfully thrown over us this morning! But how came you apprised that we were in possession of your castle, as we were without the shadow of a license from its owner?' `Partly anticipating a visit from some of you,' replied the widow, `I purposely left the door unfastened when we left last night. And a peep through the cracks when I returned this morning, and found it barred, told me very nearly the character of the occupants. But you do'nt know,' she added jocosely; `how sorely I was tempted, as I saw you lying there on the floor asleep, as helpless as children, to creep in, bind you, deliver you over to Munroe, and claim the reward!' `When you was praying, “lead us not into temptation,” at this moment of your trial,' said Warrington, laughingly, `and thought of the next sentence, “deliver us from evil,” you concluded it best to take sides with the Green Mountain Boys,— did you?' `Why,' replied she, `it might certainly be a matter of some consideration, who it were wisest to make friends, and who foes, in such a case; and especially so, since it now seems that ten Yorkers can be put to flight by one old woman.' `Ay, ay!' gaily responded the Captain; `and that fact, sir,' he added, turning with an arch look to Selden, `shows the wisdom of the doubts and apprehensions you seemed to entertain last night in approaching, without leave, the house of one who might become so formidable a foe.' `I should be sorry to spoil the Captain's joke,' replied Selden in the same spirit; `but in taking possession thus unceremoniously, I think we both depended somewhat on the effect of the peace offering we brought,' he continued, pointing to the game 7* suspended on the wall, `in appeasing the house-hold gods for the outrage.' `An ample atonement!' said the dame; `so much so, indeed, that I suspect my nine little hungry house-hold gods will think the obligation wholly on their side. Yes, yes, that mark of your kindness, gentlemen, I noticed when I took my stolen peep in here, and my heart has been thanking you ever since; for my larder, as you may well imagine, is none of the fullest, considering the number depending upon it. It makes my heart ache to put the little kites on so short an allowance, as I am often compelled to do here, in a place so difficult to obtain provisions.' `But where are your children?' asked Warrington. `My children? all in T'other World, sir!' replied the woman, with a sort of comic gravity. `In the other world! what can the woman mean?' asked Warrington, turning a puzzled look upon his hostess. `But for the mention you have just made of your children, and your roguish looks, which belie your assertions, one might be startled at the import of your words!' `Not so much of a belieing neither,' said the woman, `but come, we will open Sesame now,' she continued, proceeding to unbar the door, `and after seeing if my brood cannot be conjured back into the world again, for the purpose of assisting me, and quieting your apprehensions for their safety, Captain, we will see what can be done in the way of breakfast.' `Let me attend you to witness the process of conjuration,' said Warrington, who had more reasons for making the request than were known to either of his companions. `No, Sir, no! keep house till I return, or, my word for it, you get no breakfast this time,' replied the other, in a sportive yet determined manner, as she quitted the house on her proposed errand, leaving her guests to indulge in such conjectures as they chose respecting the place to which she had gone to summon her concealed family. They were not allowed much time, however, for discussing this curious question: for in a short time their ears were saluted by the mingled sounds of jabbering voices approaching from the woods in the rear of the house. And in a moment more the dame came up to the door, with her nearly half score of hardy little urchins, trooping along in noisy glee at her side. `I will shake hands with the young Captain first!' exclaimed one of the boys, endeavoring to outstrip the rest, as they all made a rush at the door. `You shan't!' vociferated another, springing forward and eagerly elbowing his way through the throng that was now choaking up the entrance. `I say you shan't, now, Dick! He likes me best; Ned, you hold him back!' `I don't care, I will have the first kith!' cried a lisping little image of her mother; `I will! mayn't I, ma?' she added, throwing back her long unfettered hair from before her laughing black eyes with a pretty toss of the head, and entering with high glee into the keen strife going forward for obtaining the first notice of one, who, in former calls at the house, seemed to have made warm friends of the whole band of these tiny rivals for his favors. The next moment the person of Warrington, like that of Gulliver among the Lilliputians, was almost literally covered by the little beings, two sitting on each knee shaking his imprisoned hands with all their might; the little Julia standing between, turning up her pretty cheek invitingly for the expected kiss, which, for all her declaration, instinctive modesty forbade her to ask for; one or two hold of each arm, and one, more daring and active than the rest, having clambered aloft, was sitting astride the neck, and crowing loud over the rest from his elevated situation; while all were clinging, laughing and chattering like a bevy of monkies exhibiting on an elephant at the show of some travelling menagerie. Those fashionable misanthropes of the Rochefacauldt or Lacon school, who are forever moralizing and mourning over the selfishness of man; who can see no unadulterated benevolence, no disinterested friendship in the moral deserts of the human heart, might find one oasis at least to revive their jaundiced vision, and go to refute the sweeping dictums of their cold and cheerless philosophy, would they but turn their eyes to the artless actions, and examine the untutored and guileless hearts of children. How spontaneous their affections! With what intuitive and unerring certainty and quickness they single out those who love them, whether kindred or stranger; and with what confiding readiness and generous ardour is the friendship thus bestowed upon them forever reciprocated; and that, too, with no detracting alloy of selfish feeling, no worldly calculating of results, and no influencing considerations of interest! Verily! while they go to school to us for the improvement of the head, methinks it would be well for us if the tables were so far turned that they could become our only instructors in the lessons of the heart. The dame, now calling off such of her children as she needed to assist her, and despatching one for water, another for wood, and a third to go on some whispered destination, proceeded rapidly in her preparations for the promised repast. And in a short space of time a tempting meal from the offering of her guests was smoking on the table. The meal, which was enlivened by a recital of the adventures of the band the preceding evening, was no sooner ended, than Selden, rising first from the table, departed, at the suggestion of his superior, to see that the party at the other house were in readiness to commence their march. `Now, Captain, where are you going with your men?' earnestly asked the widow, as soon as Selden was fairly gone; `I have reasons for wishing to know.' Warrington, after a slight hesitation, imparted the desired information. `Will you make me one promise,' resumed the woman, `and at the same time receive from me in kindness one caution?' `On conditions, I will venture to say yes.' `What may they be? If any thing that I can properly comply with,'— `I would impose no other terms, certainly—so now for the promise you would exact?' `Simply this, that the family, with whom the young Indian I sent you last evening resides—no question now about their names or residence!—that this family, I say, shall not be molested, should you or your men ever come across them. They hold under a York title, besure, but turned no one off to get possession. Will you promise?' `For your sake, and the Indian's sake, if the facts are as you state, I will promise my influence in their behalf.' `Now hear my caution—beware of that fellow you chastised last night—beware of that Sherwood —he will be a serpent in your path.' `Do you know him?' `I think I do, but must say no more. And now let's hear your conditions.' `Only that you shall expound my dream, or vision, of last night.' `A dream! vision!' `Yes—a something, at all events, which conveyed to my ear, as I thought, the sounds of a voice discoursing most heavenly music.' `A sleeping, or a waking dream?' `The latter, I afterwards made up my mind to believe, as the readiest way of solving the mystery; but this morning I have begun to suspect'— `At what time last night, and on what particular spot, did this strange trance fall on you, sir?' interrupted the widow in a bantering tone, which was accompanied, however, with a look betraying considerable curiosity and uneasiness. `O, about the usual time of such visitations—the witching hour of midnight. And the scene should be laid, I think, more particularly than at any other spot, near the foot of a certain charmed tree, or rather the hollow trunk of one, standing not far from the bank of the creek down here, to which, leaving my companion asleep, I had wandered alone to shake off a fit of watchfulness, that the spirits of the air, or something else, had unaccountably sent me.' `And did you relate your adventures to your companion, on your return, or since?' `No!' `That settles the question with me, then, as to what I should now do,' seriously observed the woman; `Captain Warrington, I clearly see that you have accidentally, and very singularly, hit upon a clue to matters which I thought most prudent to conceal, even from you, friend to the settlers and my family, as you are. Follow me, and you shall know more.' So saying, with rapid step she led the way in silence toward the creek, closely followed by her guest, eager to witness the promised developement. Passing directly by the hollow tree, to which she pointed with a significant smile as they went along, she conducted him to the brink of the high, steep bank, which was here covered with a thick growth of young evergreens, whose tangled boughs overhung the waters below. Now grasping firmly hold of a projecting root, she swung herself down on to a narrow shelf or offset in the bank, a few feet above the surface of the water. As soon as this position was gained by them both, she proceeded along the shelf a few yards, and, removing a small fir-tree top, which had been, to all appearance, blown down the bank, disclosed the mouth of a narrow passage running back horizontally into the earth. Into this she immediately entered, still followed by her companion. After groping their way about a rod through the dark zigzag windings of this passage, they emerged into a spacious room, formed entirely by an artificial excavation of the earth, which, from a begining at the outside, had been removed in small parcels and thrown into the stream, till the whole was completed. The walls or sides, which had been cut down perpendicularly from the solid mould and plastered over with thin mud, now presented a hard, compact surface. The ceiling, which was in the form of an arch, coming, probably, at the top or centre, within a foot of the surface above, was supported by the thickly spreading roots of the trees, standing, many of them, directly over the excavation, and forming a kind of net-work, curiously, and so strongly interwoven as effectually to prevent the earth from caving in from above. The whole interior was divided into two parts of unequal dimensions, by a slight willow-work partition, the lesser of which, being designed for the sleeping apartment, was neatly carpeted with a thick dry moss, collected from the spruce knolls in the vicinity; while on one side was extended, at suitable intervals, a row of little, oblong platforms, raised about a foot above the general level by repeated doublings of the same light, springy substance. These, on which were laid such beds as the occupant could furnish, afforded, with, or without, any further additions, soft and pleasant couches, safely protected against the damps of a ground floor. Beside one of the walls of the larger room was a rude fire-place, constructed of flat stones and built up several feet high to receive fuel and give direction to the smoke, which, ascending through a sort of retreating flue cut into the bank, escaped through the cavity of the identical hollow stub that Warrington had discovered to be in some way connected with the mysterious melody heard by him the evening before. `This, Captain Warrington,' said the dame, after showing her admiring guest every part of her subterraneous establishment, which she had lit up on entering by throwing a few light combustibles on the fire still remaining on the hearth; `this is my city of refuge—my strong hold, or my `T'other World,' as I have accustomed myself and children to call it, fancying, in my wish to keep the secret of its existence to ourselves, that some such name would lessen the chances of a discovery, which might accidentally be made, perhaps, by referring to it before others by a proper designation. It was dug out by myself and my little boys, who took to digging as naturally as young foxes, and greatly assisted me. My neighbor below, however, aided me in the most difficult parts of the work; and in case of dangers he is to occupy it with me.' `But what were the immediate dangers you apprehended, that led you to so uncommon an undertaking?' asked the other. `For myself I might feel, perhaps, no apprehensions,' replied the provident mother. `For my children, I feel differently. All parents, Captain, however brave they may be for themselves, are always cowards for their children. No real dangers, it is true, might beset us here for years; and then again, they might come like a thief in the night. To say nothing of the heartless Yorkers, who might burn my house, or turn us out shelterless into the snow—to say nothing of the wolves, that have been known, in the desperation of hunger, to attack folks in their houses—to say nothing of these, which are sufficiently fearful for most people, what security have we, in these outposts of the settlement, even in times of peace, against a hostile visit from the Indians? But when, as now, the rumors of war come floating on every breeze, that danger is daily increasing. The sad experience of my father's family, who were half slain by these hell-hounds of the wilderness at the outbreak of the last war, has taught me the wisdom of precaution. In peace they are even to be distrusted; and the first rumor of war that strikes their ears will put them to whetting their knives for slaughter; while they are sure to anticipate the 8 coming contest by striking the first blow on the defenceless families of the frontiers. Now with these views, is it strange,' she added with a smile, `that the mother of nine children, with but one neighbor within miles of her, should forsee the evil and hide herself?' `Surely not,' replied Warrington, struck not less by the forcible language of the woman, than by her prudent forecast; `you are right in believing that the storm of a new war is gathering over us; and if you think of remaining here, these precautions are but the part of wisdom, as we know not when, or where, the storm may burst. But do you occupy this retreat every night, now?' `We do.' `You enter, as we did, taking your children down the bank, I suppose?' `Sometimes but more generally by approaching from the creek in my canoe, (which is kept hid in the bushes a few rods below,) lest by coming down the bank constantly, we wear a path, which might lead to a discovery of our retreat.' `And you all lodged here last night, of course?' `Yes.' `Part of the mystery, then, stands explained—why should the rest be kept back?' `What is there more that you do not comprehend?' `The singing'— `Might have been my own, if you heard any.— You never heard any of my lullaby performances before, I suppose?' said the woman, with an evasive smile. `No, but I have once heard the performances of another, whese voice is not easily to be forgotten,' replied Warrington, turning a keen, searching gaze on the slightly confused face of the widow. `Warrington, Warrington!' said the woman, resuming a tone of seriousness, and intently reading the looks of the other; `as much as I hate deception, I wish I could have misled you. But I saw by your disappointed looks, when you entered, and glanced around these empty apartments, that you expected to find here what you have not. And I now see, that you still have certain impressions, which I wish could have been done away. But as you seem bent on following up your clue, I will not attempt to mislead you. From what I have gathered from you and others, I have for some time secretly suspected the identity of persons yet supposed to be different, and that I have long known those whose present residence you have little dreamed of: Captain Warrington, there is indeed a rose bud in this wilderness, which I should not have been displeased to see placed in your bosom. But seek it not now—there is a hedge about it too high for your leaping.' `Where is she? I ask but to know where,' enquired the other with impatient eagerness. `Not here, nor near here, now,' replied the woman; `the secret is not mine to reveal: I have said too much already; so question me no further. But come, let us leave for the upper world,' she added, rapidly leading the way out, and allowing the other no further chance to resume his importunities till they had gained the top of the bank. `But surely you will not leave the matter here, after informing me so far?' said Warrington, in an expostulating tone, as he perceived that the other seemed to expect that he would now depart. `For the present I surely shall,' replied the woman decidedly; `you will urge in vain one, who understands her duties to all. Go! your men await you—good morning, and God speed you in the cause of the settlers,' and imperiously waving her hand for the departure of her reluctant and tantalized guest, she suddenly turned away and disappeared in the forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “The sons of our mountains will sheath not the brand Till the last base intruder is forc'd from the land.” One of the most considerable openings in the wilderness in the northwestern part of the New Hampshire Grants, at the period of our story, was at the Lower Falls of Otter Creek, at the head of the lake navigation of that stream, and on, and around that fine and fertile swell of land, now occupied as the site of the pleasant and flourishing village, to which, as before mentioned, the more dignified name of city has long since been legally applied;— though not without sometimes eliciting, probably, from the traveller, approaching the place with the expectations which the appellation would naturally raise, a feeling somewhat akin, perhaps, to that which might be experienced on hearing the address of My Lord, applied to some urchin scion of nobility, at marbles, in his first jacket and trowsers. A pitch had been made on this spot, some years before, by one or more of the New Hampshire patentees, a saw and grist mill erected, and a large piece of forest felled, and partially cleared; when the whole tract, embracing the falls and all the improvements, was purchased of some of the York land jobbers by one colonel Reed. Reed had been the commander of a regiment of Scotch Highlanders, that came over with general Wolf, and was engaged with his army in that memorable battle which gave Quebec and the Canadas to the British crown. This regiment having been subsequently disbanded, the Colonel, still continuing in the new world, and, in his intercourse between Canada and New York, becoming acquainted with the Vermont lands, entered into the speculations then going forward, and made the purchase as above stated. Finding his new purchase already in the occupancy of the New Hampshire grantees, and not inclining to be bothered with the delays of a civil process by the York authorities to put him in possession, what should this military land speculator do, but repair immediately to Montreal, and, collecting a file of his old disbanded soldiers, go on, armed and provisioned, to conquer and keep, and forcibly drive the occupants from the ground, taking possession of the mills, lumber and all other improvements? After making ample provisions for continuing the improvement of his purchase, he left it to be managed and defended by the men who came on with him, placed under the command of one of his old fear-naught Highlanders, by the name of Donald McIntosh, formerly a brave and trusty sargeant in his regiment, to whom he now delivered written military instructions, setting forth the manner in which the improvements were to be conducted, and the post defended against any, 8* or all, who should offer to intrude on the premises. The Colonel, being a shrewd man, and a close observer of character, national as well as individual, and well knowing that the inherent respect of Scotchmen for discipline, and the orders of a superior, would ensure him more determined defenders of his possessions, as well as more faithful laborers in their improvement, than all the rewards, bribes, or other inducements he could offer, had thrown over the whole transaction the apperrance of a military service. And hiring his men at the monthly compensation they had formerly received as soldiers, and terming it an enlistment during the war, and conducting them to their post under the discipline to which they had been accustomed in the army, he had the address to make these men, not the most intelligent certainly, honestly believe that they were acting under their old commander in a military capacity only, and were really in the service of the king, to whom this settlement, they were told, was in a state of rebellion. And right faithfully and rigidly did the straight going Donald, ever continuing to act under these impressions, execute the trust committed to his charge. Immediately proceeding to throw up a large log house, and enclose a yard around it with a heavy, compact fence of hewn timber, he soon gave the post such an impregnable and threatening aspect as effectually deterred the former occupants from attempting, with any force they could rally in the neighborhood, to dislodge the intruders. And after watching awhile, and seeing no diminution of the strength of their antagonists, or relaxation of their caution, these ejected and plundred settlers, who happened to be among the less spirited of their countrymen, at length pretty much relinquished the hope of regaining their possessions, except in a favorable termination of the negociation still going forward at intervals between the settlers and the government of New York. In this manner, for nearly two years, did the minions of Reed hold, and manage these valuable possessions, clearing land, raising crops and exporting lumber and other products, without being at all molested by the settlers, or the attending circumstances being known, indeed, to those who had exercised any general agency in resisting the aggressions of the Yorkers. At length, however, the tranquility of the intruders became accidentally endangered. Ira Allen, the Green Mountain Metternich of after times, and one of the cabinet council of those we are describing, coming through this section on his return to his residence in Bennington from an excursion to the Winooski river, sought lodgings on a stormy December night at the quarters of Mc Intosh and his men—a call which came near costing the former his life at the outset: For, while he was unsuspectingly knocking, for admission, the wary Scotchman, who had been accustomed to consider all his foes, who did not give the watchword, noiselessly opened the door wide enough to protrude one arm, and made several desperate lunges at his body, hit or miss, with a naked sabre. Providentially, however, the weapon, missing the body, only wounded the great coat of the traveller, who, at last succeeding in making the other believe that he wanted nothing more than a shelter for the night, was now admitted, and entertained till next morning. This singular reception, as well as the odd and warlike appearance of every thing connected with the establishment, awakened the curiosity and excited the suspicions of Allen, who, from the information he obtained by pumping the cautious Donald, and making inquiries of the settlers before leaving the vicinity, returned home in possession of the full history of the case. And the consequence was, that before many months a small hand of Green Mountain Boys came on from the south, and finding no one about the premises, were proceeding to clear the house and yard of all they contained; when the occupants, who had been at work in the woods, returned, and after holding a council of war a short distance from the house, made such a furious charge with fixed bayonets on the new comers, that they, little dreaming of so warlike an onsent, were fairly routed from the works, and were compelled to decamp amidst the victorious shouts of the elated Highlanders. Chagrined and vexed at the result of this attempt, the Green Mountain Boys, early the next spring, set on foot another expedition for dispersing these military tenants of the usurping Colonel. And for this, among other objects, Warrington and his companions were now on their way to the spot. It was not till an advanced hour in the afternoon of the day which commenced by the adventures related in the last chapter, that our band arrived at the outskirts of the singularly guarded possession just described. Their force, swelled by the numbers who had joined them on the last part of their rout, now amounted to about a dozen men. They halted in the woods, adjoining the clearing, for the purpose of consultation with a view to fix on the best mode of attacking the place, which they were not without hope of carrying by surprise. They had scarcely commenced discussing these points, however, before their attention was arrested by two quickly successive reports of fire arms, proceeding from a thicket on the opposite side of the creek. `What will you bate I don't know the bark of that dog, Captain?' exclaimed Jones, tipping one of his comical winks to his superior. `Aha! who do you suspect, Jones?' asked Warrington with a look of interest. `Why I shouldn't like to make bodily oath of it, besure,' replied the other, but unless my car lies like the mischief, one of those popping noises over there was the voice of an old acquaintance.' `To the point, man, if you possibly can!' rather impatiently spoke the leader: `what acquaintance do you mean?' `The one that I was introduced to, up on the lake there last night, asking your pardon, Captain,' replied Pete, lowering his tone a little under the slightly rebuking manner of his commander. `You are in the right, Mr. Jones,' said the other, kindly, though a flash of anger passed over his face at the discovery that now burst on his mind; `I see it all, at last. Those were the reports of a pair of pistols, and in the hands, too, of that traitorous Sherwood, who has been hovering round us on our march, and now fires his pistols as a preconcerted signal, to give notice of our approach. It is well for the fellow that he was wise enough to put the creek between us and himself, before taking this last step.' `That comes of suffering the scoundrel to go unhanged last night,' grumbled Brown. `If I had been the Captain, I would have strung him up to the limb of a tree like a sheep-killing dog, and left him kicking in the air.' `It is not always,' said Warrington, `nor often, I think, that we find cause to repent of the mercies we have shown; but this fellow—let him beware!' he added, knitting his brow, `let him beware how he is taken again!' All hope of taking the place by surprise being now relinquished by our band, it was soon settled, as the most probable way of accomplishing their object without bloodshed, which they would gladly avoid, that a feint should be made in the open field, with a view of drawing out the enemy from their works, while the part of their force, not thus to be engaged, should go round in the woods, and, approaching in the rear, endeavor to get possession of the house and enclosure. In pursuance of this plan, Warrington, taking Selden and two of the men with him, started off for the purpose of carrying the last part of the arrangement into execution, leaving the rest of the force under the command of Jones, whose genius, it was thought, was calculatad to conduct the other part of the enterprise now intrusted to his charge, with orders to advance through the open grounds towards the house, and adopt such measures on the way as circumstances might suggest for bringing about the desired results. After waiting a sufficient time to allow the other party to gain a post in the woods in the rear of the works, Pete, the new commandant, put his men in motion, and emerging from the bushes, they commenced, in a wide-spread platoon, their ostentatious march through the field, in order to attract the attention of the enemy, supposed to be concealed in their enclosures at the house. It so happened that, directly in the course of the advancing party, there lay a series of large log-heaps, which, either by accident or design, had been placed, in clearing the land, very nearly in a straight line, at intervals of about a dozen rods, beginning near the house and extending almost to the woods. When the party had arrived within a few rods of the first log-heap, their attention was arrested by the sound of a human voice, issuing from behind it, and, in an eager, suppressed tone, giving off some brief orders, resembling those of military command. `A' ready? up then, an' gie til the louns!' exclaimed the voice of the unseen leader, in broad Scotch, as a platoon of armed men suddenly rose from behind the logs, and, raising their guns breast high, discharged them full in the faces of the Green Mountain Boys. `Noo, right aboot face! and rin as if the deevil was after ye, as he is, an mair too,' resumed the military Donald, for it was no other than he and his men, who had thus been lying in concealment behind the log-heap, patiently awaiting the approach of their unsuspecting assailants. The balls, just clearing the heads of our band, whistled through the air, and struck with a crash among the dry limbs of the forest behind them. As soon as they had recovered from the surprize into which they had been thrown by the suddenness of this unexpected attack, they all sprang forward in the screening smoke of the enemy's fire, and gained the cover of the log-heap, just relinquished by the latter for the next one in the line of their defences. `Well, this is what I should call rather a curious how-d'ye-do, boys,' coolly said Jones, when they had gained their shelter; `who would have guessed the scamps were packed away behind this old log-heap? But one thing beats my philorsophy—if the bloody dogs really wanted to give us the lead, (and they shot dreadful careless if they didn't,) why in natur didn't they take aim?' `They are all regular sarvice men,' replied a settler from the vicinity, `and breast-high is the rule of firing in the army.' `Then we may thank the rule for our lives, and not the pesky fools who used it,' replied the former. `It would not be a great deal more than right to send our rifle bullets through the whole tote of 'em. But I should some rather not kill the sarpents, if we can get along without; and I guess as how we can, seeing they were kind enough to sound their rattles before trying to bite, as that queer old codger did, in giving off word before they let drive at us. And if they will go on as they have begun, we'll just be making our manners when they fire, so that the balls may pass over us, and then follow 'em up as before—but hark! the old chap is at it again! going the motions as regular as the night-mare; there! he has got to `cock fire-lock!' Now, down with you, boys!' Jones and his men had scarcely thrown themselves on to their knees behind their log-heap breast-work, before another volley of balls, discharged with the same military precision, whistled over them; and again the old dry hemlocks that skirted the woods appeared to be the only sufferers. Again retreating to their next post, these kilted defenders of the place were followed up as at first by their crafty assailants, who were now becoming highly delighted with the fun of so unique a warfare. And in this manner the fight, if fight it be called, continued through the whole field—one party blazing away at random from every log-heap they reached, and then scudding on for the next, quite satisfied with this way of doing their duty of defending these supposed possessions of the king, since they were conducting their defence, as they believed, according to military rule: while the other party, occasionally discharging their pieces into the air, to keep up the appearance of a hostile pursuit, and sometimes raising their hats on their ramrods just high enough above the logs, behind which they were ensconced, to become visible to their foes when they fired, that they might be thus encouraged to continue the sport, were no less content with this fashion of fighting, as it answered all the objects in view, without putting them to the necessity of killing others, and, what was quite as agreeable, without running any risk of being killed themselves. But, leaving these belligerents for the present, we will now follow those who departed to execute the other part of this novel enterprise. Keeping within the border of the woods, Warrington and his attendants soon made the circuit round the clearing, and arrived at the bank of the creek, in the rear of the buildings, before the attack was made on the other detachment. They had scarcely gained this position, however, before they were aroused by the rattling of McIntosh's salutatory volley on their companions, at the other extremity of the opening. And though the rise of land, which intervened between them and the scene of action, prevented them from ascertaining by sight the exact situation of affairs, yet readily concluding that the enemy, in full force, had taken the open field, as had been anticipated, they made for the house with all possible speed, to get possession of the works before the occupants could find time to return. On reaching the enclosure round the house, Warrington, leaving his men in the rear, went round to the front side, and, after a moment spent in reconnoitering, from behind a wood-pile, the parties in the field, crept up and made an attempt to open the gate.— 9 But to his disappointment, he soon discovered that it was securely barred on the inside; while the noise of some slight movement within apprised him that the place had not been left wholly unguarded. On making these discoveries, he immediately retreated to the rear, without being seen by the enemy. There, standing beside the wall of the enclosure and eagerly gazing through a small crevice between the timbers, he found Selden, who, now turning with an expressive look, silently beckoned him to approach. Obeying the sign, Warrington carefully stepped up to the spot and put his eye to the aperture, which the other, now yielding the place, pointed out with his finger; when all that part of the arena within, which was in front of the house, was opened to his view. And the object that there met his eye struck him with scarce less surprise than what had been just manifested by his more romantic companion. Near the barricaded entrance into the yard, instead of a bearded warrior, stood a young and neatly dressed female, of striking beauty, holding a musket, and apparently enacting the part of a sentry to fire an alarm gun, or open the gate on the signal of her friends. She had evidently heard the movements of those without, and was now standing, like a startled fawn, her bosom heaving with suppressed alarm, her lips slightly drawn apart, and her head turned in the attitude of intense listening—all combining to give an air of charming and picturesque wildness to her whole appearance. A swarthy faced girl was timidly peeping from the nearly shut door of the house, to which, on hearing the noise, she had apparently just retreated. From the dress and appearance of the latter, Warrington was but at little loss in tracing between these two females the relation of mistress and maid. And now, with a rapid survey of the situation of the whole interior, as far as could be seen, he hastily quitted his stand at the crevice and turned to Selden. `Isn't she a vision of a creature?' eagerly whispered the latter, his fine dark eyes sparkling with animation; `what, in the way of feminine wonders, will you show us next, Warrington? But who, and what can she be?' `I am scarcely wiser than yourself, in that respect.' `If the other was a Juno, this, I suppose, must be some warrior sylph of the Green Mountains.' `Not of the Green Mountains, I suspect,' rejoined Warrington; `but be she sylph, or satan in heavenly guise, we must pay her a visit, and have possession of the works, within ten minutes—the enemy are on the retreat for the gate, and there is no time to lose—advance, boys, and lend me your shoulders for a stepping stone to scale this wall.' The walls of the enclosure were about ten feet high, exclusive of the pickets which surmounted them, and which were formed of stakes three or four feet long, sharply pointed at the top, and set into large auger holes, bored in the upper layer of timber. Taking his men to a part of the wall in rear of the house, which would screen them, in their attempt, from the view of the inmates in front, and thus afford them a better chance to get over unmolested, and without causing an alarm to be given too soon, the leader mounted the shoulders of one of his men, leaped on to the top of the timbers, and soon luckily, and without noise, succeeded in wrenching out pickets enough to give him a ready ingress. And taking up his rifle from the hands of those below, and ordering two of them to follow, and the other, who would have no means of getting up, to act in concert with Jones, he now swung himself down upon the ground. In another moment, Selden and the man he had selected, having been equally successful, they all three stood undiscovered on the ground, in the narrow space between the wall and the back side of the house. `Well, Selden,' said Warrington, with a humorous look; `in what manner shall we proceed with this formidable garrison—by storm or parley?' `The latter, certainly, unless the storm is to be a storm of kisses,' replied the other, in the same spirit; `but seriously, lest the appearance of all of us at once occasion unnecessary alarm, I would propose that one of us go forward alone, for this purpose.' `Yours shall be the chance, then, of displaying your bravery, gallantry or diplomacy, as the case may require, in treating with the fair commander.' `Thank'ee captain.' `But have a caution, sir—remember, that other things sometimes inflict wounds besides leaden bullets!' `O, borrow no trouble on my account, on either score,' gaily responded Selden, as he disappeared round the corner of the house, on his delicate mission. The merry boast of the last speaker, however, had, but for his good fortune, been a vain one: For the next moment after he passed out of the sight of his friends, the stunning report of a musket saluted their ears, while a bullet whistled by them and buried itself in the wall of the enclosure, a few feet from where they stood. Instantly springing forward toward the scene of action, they found Selden standing in mute surprise, but unhurt, a few yards in front of the house, and as many rods from the mad girl, who, in the suddenness of the alarm and trepidation that seized her, as she accidentally turned round and unexpectedly beheld an enemy within the enclosure and approaching her, had just committed the half involuntary, half frenzied act of discharging at him a well loaded musket, whose fatal contents he had but narrowly escaped. For a moment there was a dead pause, during which neither of the parties stirred from their respective positions, being nearly invisible to each other in the smoke which was rising in eddying whirls between them. Soon, however, the light and airy form of the warrior damsel became visible to her astonished besiegers. There, pale, agitated, and almost frantic with conflicting emotions, she still stood, as if chained to the spot, holding with convulsive grasp the yet smoking musket, and apparently scarcely less frightened at what she had done than for her own personal safety. After gazing an instant with increasing consternation and alarm as she beheld the now threbled number of the enemy, she suddenly threw down her gun, and made a desperate push to unbar the gate. `Nay, nay! lady,' exclaimed Warrington, leaping forward to her side, and placing his hands firmly upon the bars; `this we cannot suffer now, though we intend you no harm,' he continued, in a gentler tone; `but you had better retire—this is no place for one of your sex. Mr. Selden, will you conduct her into the house?' 9* `Touch me not!' half shrieked the baffled and maddened girl, shrinking from the touch of Selden, who now approached, and offered to lead her to the house; `touch me not, villain—monster!' `Be calm—calm your fears, dear lady!' said Selden, in a soothing and respectful tone, `will you hear me? Will you look me in the face? There! do I appear like a villain? now hear me: although we may try to restore these possessions to their former, and, as we believe, rightful owners, yet, in doing this, we would not willingly injure a single man of the defenders—much less a female. Be prevailed on, then, to retire, and I pledge myself, on the honor of a gentleman, that no hair of your head shall be injured.' During this address, the kind and tender manner of which seemed to strike unexpectedly on her ears, she turned, and looking full upon the manly and handsome face of Selden, a change passed over her agitated countenance. Her over-tasked nerves gave way, and her assumed nature melting away into its original softness, like a storm of March dissolving into the tears of April, she burst into a fit of hysteric weeping, and now suffered herself to be conducted unresistingly into the house. By this time Donald and his men who, on hearing the report of the musket just fired, as they were making a stand behind the last logheap of their line of defences, hastily discharged a parting round at the enemy and fled for the works, had reached the enclosure; and the former was now vociferating the watchword, and rattling away at the gate, for admittance. Meanwhile Jones with his detachment, being apprised that his friends were in possession of the works by a handkerchief which the latter had, as a preconcerted signal, hung on a corner picket, rushed on after the retreating Scotchmen on their way to the gate, intending to follow them so closely that they should have no time to reload their guns before they could be compelled to surrender. Looking round and seeing his foes close upon him, McIntosh redoubled his clamor to get in. `O, why dinna ye open the gaet?' exclaimed the impatient and distressed Highlander, still ignorant that any others were within than those he left there; `thae feckfu' deevils are hard at our heels. Och! oigh! Jessy, Jessy Reed! is it my ain colonel's dochter that wad be doylt at sic a time? An' Zilpah, is your mistress dead, or ye a' fear't an' fasht thegither, that ye nae ken the coming o' us?' `Your ladies are all safe in the house, my honest friend,' cried out Warrington in reply, `but your quarters are now in possession of other hands. You had better surrender, Sir, as it will be of little use to contend against those who are now too strong for you, both within and without.' The astonishment and dismay of the simple minded Scotchman at the discovery, that his foes had obtained a lodgment within his strong hold, was unbounded; for having perceived nothing wrong about his works at the time his attention was arrested by the report of the musket within them, and soon after seeing the man left outside by Warrington running out into the field, he supposed the gun was fired by the bold and wayward girl who had volunteered for the service, only to apprise him that some one was round the outside of the works. And he and his men, having given a merry hurra! for the braw lassee who frightened away the skulking tramper, had come on and reached the gate in the confident expectation that in another moment they should be safely ensconced within their works, and beyond the reach of all pursuers. `Gude guide us!' he ejaculated, looking hurriedly around him while his countenance exhibited the very picture of perplexity and distress; `Gude guide us! gor't by the rake-hells wi' in an' wi' out! O what wad I do! what wad I do!' `I'll just tell you what to do, you queer old divil!' sung out Jones, catching the last part of these exclamations, as he brought his men to a halt within two rods of the Scotchmen, who now, mechanically facing about, and presenting their fixed bayonets to their opponents, stood glumly awaiting the commands of their leader. `I will tell you what to do,' he repeated, `you must knuckle to, old fellow. What's the particular use in your standing out against these six loaded rifles, to say nothing of the Captain and his folks inside, if they should take a notion to wake you up a little? so I take it the cunningest thing you can do jist now is, for you all to throw down your guns and surrender.' `Hoot awa' mon!' exclaimed McIntosh, aroused by this fresh summons to surrender; `an' I rede ye'll find wese fight an' defend til the last drap o' our bluide! attention there!' he continued, hastily turning to his men, `prime an' load!' Warrington now sternly repeated his demand for an immediate surrender; but the obstinate Highlander, knowing no way of obeying the military instruction of his Colonel, `to fight and defend,' but to fight on at whatever odds, or whatever the consequences to him and his men, deigned no other answer to this repetition of the summons than by urging his men to despatch in loading their pieces. `What is to be done, Captain,' coolly said Jones, calling to his superior, and at the same time giving a nod to his men, at which they all promptly cocked their rifles and brought them to their shoulders; `speak tolerable quick, if you've any orders, for they are about loaded, and we some rather give than take under all the circumstances.' `Neither!' shouted Warrington, `do neither— knock up their guns! disarm them! grapple with them, and if too many for you, we will soon be among you.' A sudden, furious rush was now made by the Green Mountain Boys on their astonished antagonists, who, not dreaming of this mode of attack, and being busily intent on loading their guns, were taken by complete surprise, and to a great disadvantage to themselves. And before they had recovered from their astonishment sufficiently to put themselves in a posture of defence, most of their guns were wrenched from their hands, their bodies seized round the waist, and some of them thrown to the ground; while grappling man with man, all were instantly involved better skelter in the tremendous scuflle that now ensued. And although the Green Mountain Boys were now in the exercise of their favorite athletics, and notwithstanding their great strength and suppleness of limb, they soon found that the entire subjection of these brawny and resolute Highlanders was no very easy task. Though thrown to the ground, they had to be held there; though knocked down, they again rose to the fight, and though beaten, they yielded not. And the victory had perhaps, been even doubtful, had not Warrington now thrown open the gate, and come, with a fresh force, to the rescue. Then, indeed, it was not till they saw their leader lying bound and helpless on the ground, that the pugnacious Scotchmen could be brought to say that they yielded themselves prisoners. `I have na yielded yet, ye hogshoutherin rap scallions!' roared Donald, scornfully, as he lay on the ground with scarcely a member of his body, except his tongue, at liberty; `I hae na yielded, an' as muckle victory as ye think to mak it, ye sal never say that Donald McIntosh ca'd himsel prisoner wi'out first settling the conditions o' the surrender.' `What conditions would you have, brave Scot,' asked Warrington, with great show of respect, as soon as he could be heard amidst the shouts of laughter that followed this ludicrous declaration of the vanquished leader. `What conditions? Why to be allowed to march out wi' a' the honors o' war, an' a safe pasport for thae women an' a' the gear, an' property,' replied McIntosh, somewhat soothed by the respectful manner of the other. `And will you quietly yield up the place and depart, if we will allow you these conditions?' rejoined Warrington, evidently disposed to humor the fallen warrior in his laughable demand. `We wael bide thae terms of surrender,' replied the other, `an' ye hae the word o' Donald McIntosh til the bargain.' `We will let the man have his way for the bravery he has shown,' said Warrington, turning to his men. `Take away their ammunition, but restore them their guns, and unbind their leader. Now Captain McIntosh, arise—parade your men, and conduct the surrender in such manner as suits your pleasure.' Deeply impressed with a sense of what he deemed the honor of his profession required in surrendering so important a military post of the king, as he considered this, McIntosh arose, formed his men, marched into the enclosure, halted, faced about, sent a corporal to bring out the ladies and place them in the rear, marched out again, grounded arms, and, with an air of great formality and consequence, pronounced himself and followers prisoners of war, to depart on parole, to serve no more on this coast during the war. Warrington, from his knowledge of the national character of his prisoners, entertaining no doubts of their fidelity in strictly observing all the stipulations of their leader, now cordially invited them to remain at the post through the night. And the invitation being as cordially accepted, both parties within an hour were commingling in the greatest amity and good feeling, the Green Mountain Boys secretly elated with their success in reducing this strong hold of the Yorkers, and their late opponents resting satisfied with the gallant efforts they had made in its defence. The next day the vanquished, availing themselves of the permission granted them by the victors, conveyed all the moveable property of their master on board several large batteaux, which had been kept there for the purpose of exporting lumber or other products of the farm, and set sail down the creek for St. Johns, or some one of Colonel Reed's possessions on the York side of the lake, near its northern extremity. Thus terminated this unique and curious contest, which proved to be the last one of any magnitude that occurred between the New Hampshire grantees and the Yorkers, for the possession of the soil within the disputed territory. The place being thus left in the hands of the Green Mountain Boys, they immediately reinstated the owners and former occupants, and soon after, strengthening and enlarging the defences into a more regular fortress, they posted a small, permanent force there to prevent so important a position from falling again into the hands of the Yorkers, or any new set of minions which the late military aggressor might see fit to send on for a second forcible seizure. No further attempt, however, was made to wrest the place from their hands; nor did any of the late offenders ever make their appearance in the place, except the brave and honest, though strangely mistaken McIntosh, who, indeed, after a while returned, but with views not a little altered: For becoming by some means undeceived as to the nature of his late trust, and being excessively mortified at the development, which robbed him, in his own estimation, of nearly all the glory he had gained in defending it, he seemed to have foresworn the military, for a more quiet profession. And purchasing a farm in the neighborhood, he settled down upon it, and, in the peacable pursuits of agriculture, spent the remainder of an unusually long life, no less respected for scrupulous honesty, than distinguished for the whimsical obsurdities that occasionally marked his conduct. But there is one of the conquered band whom we have no notion of disposing of in so summary a manner—we mean the heroine of the party—the spirited, wild, wayward and beautiful Jessy Reed, who was, indeed, no other than the daughter of the usurping Colonel. The singularity of the position which our band found her occupying at this place, and the attending circumstances, we will give her an opportunity of hereafter explaining, and content ourselves for the present with a few words respecting her destination, and the manner of her departure from the scene where she was introduced to the reader. Instead of going with McIntosh and his men to the north, she had expressed a wish to proceed to the residence of a family with whom her father was intimate, living near the south end of the lake. But the large boats being all required to transport the effects, and the hands needed to man them, an open skiff, and one man to row it, were the only accommodations that could well be afforded her. Still she persisted in her determination. But should she be permitted to embark with no more attendants? The air of extreme novelty attending this singular girl, together with her personal attractions, had from the first made a strong impression on the mind of Selden. He began with playing the soother—suceeded, and became her attendant, the evening after the affray, in a twilight walk along the banks of the Otter, during which he was as much surprised at the exhibition of intelligence and wit, into which he had artfully drawn her, as charmed and interested with her beauty, and a certain piquancy and dash of romance which nature and a semi-military education had thrown into her character. But how far this interest was reciprocated, he had no means of judging. And should he now offer to become her attendant on her proposed voyage through the lake, would the offer be received? Would she suffer to attend her one of those who had wrested away her father's possessions; one from whom she yesterday recoiled as from the touch of a viper, branding him with the epithets of villain and monster? Sudden metamorphoses are no miracles in this changing 10 world, thought Selden, and a failure in this case shall not happen from the want of an attempt. He delicately made the proposal. She hesitated, blushed a little, and accepted. “Was ever woman in such humour woo'd!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “And I methinks, till I am old, A fairer maid shall ne'er be hold— The sloping lawn, the cottage small, The outspread lake, the water fall, And thou, the spirit of them all!” A few miles from the eastern side of Lake Champlain, and nearly opposite to Crown Point, where now moulder the ruins of one of the oldest fortresses in North America, a bald, jagged and desolate looking peak, known by the ungracious appellation of Snake Mountain, stands frowning over the surrounding levels in solitary and repulsive grandeur. This detached and lofty mountain, being the highest and indeed the only eminence of any magnitude, in all that extensive and beautiful tract of country lying between the lake and Otter Creek for the last thirty miles of its course, served among the settlers, before roads were much opened in this part of the wilderness, as a guide, or land mark, for all those who had occasion to travel the woodlands in this vicinity. And Warrington, after safely establishing his friends in their possessions at the Lower Falls, and despatching a small band of his forces in pursuit of the York Surveyor, repaired, with the remainder of his men, to the western brow of this mountain, as a rendezvous to which his whole party were to assemble when the surveyor was secured, proposing to employ the interim in making observations preparatory to some contemplated operations in the neighborhood of the place. He was, as the reader has already been apprised, the owner, under a New Hampshire Grant, of a considerable body of wild land, lying along the shore of the lake, upon a part of which, he had been informed, some one had entered under color of a York title. And as the tract of land in question was situated between this mountain and the lake, it was now his intention to ascertain whether the information he had received was correct, and, if found to be so, to take measures for ejecting the intruder, whose name even was unknown to him. With this object in view, our leader, leaving his men to prepare a shelter for their temporary quarters, took his rifle, and set off alone through the woods in the direction in which the improvements of the supposed intruder were said to be located. After travelling some miles in this direction, he arrived at the top of the last offset, in the lakeward slope of the country, before reaching the shore, which now appeared a short distance in front, while an opening of considerable extent became visible on the left. Approaching the skirt of this opening, and carefully noticing the natural land marks around it, he soon became convinced that the whole clearing, with all the improvements, was embraced within the boundaries described in his own patent. Having satisfied himself in this respect, he now turned his attention more particularly to the improvements themselves, and felt a degree of surprise on witnessing their comparative extent and superiority over the rest of those of this recently settled country. The house was uncommonly neat and comfortable in its appearance, and very pleasantly situated on the green and graduated margin of a beautiful little brook, that meandered, with many a glittering cascade, through a smooth meadow, and entered the woods a few rods below the spot where he stood. The out-house, barn, garden, and every thing around, were in good keeping—all going to furnish unequivocal indication that enterprise, taste and some degree of wealth, had here been employed. Much did Warrington wonder who could be the enterprising occupant, who had accomplished all this in so short a time, and still more, that it could have been done without more particular intelligence reaching him respecting it. But whoever he might be, it was not probable that he would part with such fair possessions without a struggle; and as a garrison was near, the troops of which were understood to be in the York interest, and stood ready, doubtless, to protect the intruder, Warrington at once saw that a considerable force might be necessary to dispossess him, and even should the attempt be successfully made, the same force might be required to be permanently stationed there to defend it. After revolving this subject in his mind awhile, he concluded to defer it for further consideration, and perhaps for a consultation with his companions; and now dismissing the matter from his mind, he again gave his attention to the inviting prospect around him. The day was bright and tranquil; the balmy breath of spring, wafted over flowering field and budding forest, was dallying with the whispering pines above, thus gratifying one sense with delicious odours, and soothing another with the soft and dying murmurs of æolian melody. The long tract of the far stretching waters of the lake, sleeping in the rays of the descending sun, shone with dazzling brightness, which, at intervals, was beautifully relieved by the dark green islands which studded the glittering expanse. The sloping uplands beyond, which reanimating nature was just beginning to clothe in the green vesture of summer, rose up from the long line of nodding pines that lined the western margin of the lake, in beautiful perspective, each individual feature of the landscape becoming more and more indistinct in the mellowing distance, till the view was terminated by the last long ridge of climacteric mountains, whose tall ice-clad peaks, fiercely flashing in the sun, were marked in bold outlines against the cloudless blue of the heavens. A solitary flag was waving over the massy and frowning walls of the opposite fortress, on which the Mene Tekel had already been traced by the unseen hand that writes the destines of nations: for the emblem lion, that there now proudly floated on the breeze, and glorying in his strength and prowess, seemed bidding defiance to the world, was doomed, before many revolving suns had finished their daily course, to be plucked down by those, who were alike fearless in their resistance to oppression, whether coming from a sister colony or a parent country. While Warrington, who was an enthusiastic admirer of nature, with whom he particularly loved to commune in the solitudes of the forest where her empire was undisturbed by the works of art, was giving his soul to the magnificent prospect before him, he was recalled from his reverie by the light 10* plashing of oars in the waters below. And turning his eyes in the direction of the sound, he indistinctly discerned through the trees a small skiff approaching the shore of the lake, rowed by a single person, who, on reaching his landing, drew up his boat, and, after taking out of it a gun, ascended the bank. As he emerged from the thick underwood that skirted the shore into the more open forest, and advanced into the higher grounds, Warrington soon discovered, from his uniform, that he was a soldier, or some subaltern, from the fort, who had come over, he concluded, in search of the partridge, or other light game, with which the woods here very plentifully abounded. The man still continued leisurly to advance into the forest till he had reached the runlet before mentioned; when something on his right, in the direction of the clearing, seemed suddenly to attract his notice. And, after pausing awhile in apparent doubt and indecision, he began somewhat cautiously, and with an air of hesitation, to move forward towards the object which had arrested his attention, and which he still appeared to keep anxiously in view. Our leader, who in the meanwhile kept his stand unobserved, supposing the other had sprung some game at which he was endeavoring to obtain a favorable shot, continued, with a sort of listless curiosity, to watch his motions, till he had passed out of sight behind an intervening copswood of low firs, that thickly extended along the slope, some half dozen rods from the clearing. In a few moments, and as the former yet stood patiently listening for the report of the expected shot, the voice of a female, coming from the quarter to which his attention was directed, and uttering a slight cry, as of mingled surprise and alarm, reached his ear. The voice of the man was next heard in the earnest, though flurried tones of seeming entreaty, which appeared to be followed by a hasty movement towards the object addressed,— and in a moment more a piercing shriek rose wildly from the spot. Grasping his rifle, and plunging into the thicket, Warrington bounded down the hill with the speed of a wild deer towards the scene; and in another instant the parties were revealed to his sight—a young lady of the most interesting exterior, with her hair loosened and falling in disorder over her neck and shoulders, and her flushed countenance eloquent with indignation and alarm, as with half averted face she struggled to free herself from the fellow, who, by a grasp of one hand on her garment, was endeavoring to detain her in her attempted flight. One glance at the victim of this rude assault sufficed to tell the unexpecting and astonished Warrington that the fair original of that picture, which had been so long engraven on his heart, was before him, requiring his instant aid and protection. `Back! ruffian, back!' exclaimed he, as with levelled piece he rushed upon the soldier, who stood mute and confounded before so unlooked for an apparition; `back! I say—unhand the lady, or you die on the spot!' Quailing beneath the stern and withering glances of the other, the abashed aggressor immediately relinquished his hold on the girl, and muttering a denial of any intentional wrong and a few curses at the interference of Warrington, shrunk away and disappeared in the woods. `I am much indebted to you, sir,' said the still agitated maiden, scarce audibly, her eyes timidly bent on the ground, as her protector now gently advanced to her side. `Miss Hendee'—said Warrington, hesitatingly, after an awkward silence of a moment; `do I not behold my former acquaintance, Miss Alma Hendee?' `Mr. Howard!' exclaimed the girl, as with deep surprise she now for the first time lifted her eyes to scan the features of her before unrecognized deliverer. A slight flush passed over the face of the other, on hearing himself addressed by that name, and he opened his lips as if to correct his fair friend, but a second thought seemed to repress the expression of the first, and, quickly recovering from his hesitation, he observed, `I little thought to have met you here, Miss Hendee. I could almost forgive the wretch who caused you this fright, since he has been the means of my meeting again with one whom I have never ceased to remember with pleasure. But you have companions near, surely?' `No nearer than the house, from which I wandered down the run just now, and, tempted by these flowrets peeping up along the banks, extended my ramble, perhaps imprudently, thus far into the woods.' `And is this fair situation, then, your home—the residence of your father?' `Certainly, it is,' replied Miss Hendee, resuming her natural cheerfulness; `why, surely, Mr. Howard, you did not suppose I had turned wood-nymph to wander in the forests, and house in the caves— did you?' `I hardly knew what to think, for it never occurred to me that the father of Alma Hendee could be in possession of this beautiful opening.' `And why not, my dear sir? Why, we have been here these three years. And if we have not made the wilderness blossom like the rose, we have at least got so far as to make the rose blossom in the wilderness—come, you shall attend me home, and see what a pretty flower garden I have in progress.' `To the opening, at least,' responded Warrington, obeying the motions of his fair companion. `And now, sir,' resumed the latter gaily, as they proceeded on their way, `having answered your-questions, let me be the catechist awhile, will you? And in the first place, from what cloud so opportunely dropped my gallant deliverer, just at the particular moment he was wanted?' `I, too, am an inhabitant of the Green Mountain settlement, though not of this vicinity,' answered the other: `and you see,' he continued, smilingly pointting to his rifle, `that my old propensities still hang about me; and for the present you must take this as an explanation of my wandering into this section of the country. I had just arrived at the border of the woods up yonder, and was viewing your delightful situation, when your cries brought me to your side.' `I am half ashamed of the noise I made,' rejoined the lady, `and I presume it was unnecessary. He has occasionally been at our house; and how far he considered himself warranted on such an acquaintance to obtrude himself as he did, I know not. But being started by the fellow's unexpected appearance, and uncertain, from his hesitating and equivocal manner, what might be the nature of the proposals, which he said he wished to make, and which at last he seemed determined I should stop to hear, I became much alarmed, I will confess; though I should feel excessively mortified to have any stir made about it. I hope you will not mention the affair to my father when we get home?' `Certainly not, if it is your wish—that is, I would not, if I were to see him,' replied Warrington, pausing, as they now came into the open field. `But surely, sir, you will go to the house? My father will be very much pleased to renew his acquaintance with his Doctor Hunter, as he would always persist in calling you.' `Your kind invitation, believe me, Miss Hendee, is most gratefully received; but I think it would hardly be advisable for me at this time to accept it.' `And why not?—so near, and not visit us? I know my father will be delighted to see you, and have you spend several days with us—particularly so, I imagine, at the present time, when he is not without apprehensions of an attack from the Green Mountain Boys, as they call them. Why, did you know that a band of these men have, for several days past, been ravaging the settlement along Otter Creek, headed by that terrible fellow, Captain Warrington?' `I heard,' replied the other, confused and stammering at this unexpected question, and the commentary on his own character which he perceived it involved in the mind of his fair companion, `I heard—that is, I was aware that the person you mention had come into this part of the country. But your father need be under no apprehensions on that account;' he continued, regaining his composure, `for I think I can very safely answer for Warrington, that neither he, nor any of his followers, shall ever disturb the father of Alma Hendee.' `You can! can you? But why couple my name so very oddly with that of this fearful man?—I do not fully comprehend—I know there are two parties in this settlement, and I suppose he and his company pretend to be acting for the New Hampshire party. Perhaps you belong to this party, and know him, and can influence him in our behalf? Oh! if you would!—But come, do go to the house with me, and assure my father of this.' `Not now—another time—perhaps to-morrow, I may visit you—that is if'—and Warrington paused and hesitated, as if doubtful whether to proceed, while, with a waiting and wondering expression, the girl stood earnestly looking him in the face. `Miss Hendee,' he at length resumed, somewhat pensively, `you left the place, which afforded me the pleasure of your acquaintance, unexpectedly,—quite so to me. On my return, a day or two after our last interview, to my great disappointment, I found you were gone —whither, I was never able to discover.' `We intended you no disrespect, however. Mr. Howard, in leaving thus unceremoniously,' replied the girl, exchanging the free and cordial, for a more guarded and distant manner, as if she instinctively anticipated what was to follow. `My father, who, as you was aware, had then become able to resume his journey, gained some information from a traveller, who called in your absence, which led him to determine on leaving the place the next morning. I certainly should have been happy at that time to see you again and apprise you of our departure.' `At that time,' rejoined the other, catching the emphasis, and slowly, and with a tone of disappointment, repeating the expression, `at that time,'—and have Miss Hendee's feelings, then, changed since I last saw her?' `I then esteemed you, Mr. Howard, much—very much, indeed,' she evasively replied, looking down, while her fingers were busy in tearing a little flower that she had plucked by the way: `I thought highly of you—very; and I still know not why I should not regard you with the same respect.' `Respect, my dear Miss Hendee, is a term that falls coldly on the ears of those who are looking, or at least hoping, for a warmer expression. You were sensible, were you not, that, at the time to which we have been alluding, I was cherishing for you a tenderer sentiment?' `I had no right to understand so,' tremulously replied the lovely listener, the quick heavings of whose bosom plainly told the tumult that had been awakened within; `you certainly made no professions that would warrant me in such a belief.' `Miss Hendee,' resumed the other after a pause, `you were, if I rightly understood your character, as I presume you are now, a frank and ingenuous girl. May I then not hope, that, in kindness to me, you will give a frank answer to a question which I would ask you?' `If a proper one.' `If then a profession, which I intended to have made you, had opportunity been allowed, were to be made now, are there more obstacles now, than then, to prevent it being favorably received?' She made no reply, and Werrington, stealing a glance at her averted face, perceived that her eyes were suffused with tears. `There is indeed, then, one between us,' at length said the other sadly. `There is,' was the reply in a tone of regret, which should have satisfied even the monopolizing heart of a lover. But love with men, oftener than otherwise wholly blind to policy, is rarely content to rest satisfied with those indirect expressions and delicate intimations, which are a surer proof of its existence in the female heart than the most open declarations, and, absurdly craving more, is not unfrequently compelled to put up with less. It was thus with our lover as he rejoined— `May I not have the happiness to hear those lips declare that my affection has been in some measure reciprocated?' Still there was no reply. `Am I to understand,' resumed Warrington, `that Miss Hendee has pledged her hand irrevocably? And can it be that she has pledged herself too for a union into which her heart can never enter?' `What have I said, Mr. Howard,' replied the girl, looking up with the air of offended pride, `to warrant such questions? With some, perhaps, I might not be slow to resent your intimation. And as it is,' she continued with great dignity, `you will hold me excused, I trust, for declining to commune further on a subject, which should now be as uninteresting to you, as it is embarrassing, and even painful to me.' `Surely, surely! dearest lady, you cannot believe that I would intentionally offend?' said the disconcerted lover. `We will, however, dismiss this subject for the present, if so unpleasant.' `For the present, and forever!' `If it must be so—and yet'— `No more, no more—I know not even that I have done right in listening to what you have already said, or remaining here so long. You will now receive 11 my adieu, and excuse my immediate return.' `One moment yet—you will not deny me another interview?' `At my father's house, and in my father's presence, most certainly not.' `Even on these hard conditions, I will, then, soon seek it—cruel one, adieu.' `Adieu!' responded the beauteous girl, as, triping lightly away, she looked back with a smile so eloquently sweet, that it erased in an instant the effect of every frown she had given, and every negative she had uttered, from the mind of her repulsed, but not despairing lover. The progress we have now made in our story makes it necessary to recur to some incidents of an earlier date, connected with several of our leading personages, and having a bearing on the events yet to follow:— Some three or four years previous to the events just related, and when the settlers were first meditating an open resistance to the authorities of New York, it became an object with the former to ascertain how far the government of that province was there sustained in its attempted aggression on the Grants, by the feelings and opinions of the people at large—whether, indeed, there did not exist among that people, especially those living near the disputed territory, a considerable degree of sympathy for the settlers in their unrighteous persecutions: For in the event of such a sympathy, the latter believed that the meditated resistance might be ventured upon with safety, or with safety, at least, when compared with a case where the feelings of the people were enlisted on the side of the government. It was therefore determined that an emissary should be sent into the part of New York lying contiguous to the Grants, who, travelling in disguise, or with disguised objects, should endeavor to ascertain the true sentiments and feelings of the people on this subject; and Warrington was the person selected for this delicate, though important enterprise. Accordingly setting out alone with his rifle, and travelling on foot under the assumed name of Howard, and in the character of a hunter and herbalist, he travelled all that section of the country into which he had been particularly sent, calling at almost every house in his course and mingling with all companies and classes in pursuing the objects of his secret mission. And it was while on this excursion, that he accidentally formed the interesting acquaintance, of which the reader has already been apprised. Happening on one of the main roads leading from the east to Albany, he was overtaken by a gentleman and lady in a carriage, travelling towards the last mentioned place. They had passed by him but a few rods, however, before the horse suddenly took fright and overturned the carriage, by which the man was seriously hurt, though the lady fortunately escaped with little injury. Springing forward to their aid, Warrington, after securing the horse with no little difficulty and danger, turned his attention to the travellers, who proved to be a father and daughter. of the name of Hendee. Assisting the wounded man into his vehicle, and placing his daughter by his side to support him, he attended them, leading the horse, to the nearest habitation, which was a poor inn not far from the place of the accident. And having formerly been placed in circumstances in which he had gained considerable practical knowledge of medicine, he, in the absence of a regular physician in that thinly settled country, undertook the cure of the invalid himself, closely attending him till he became convalescent, and repeating his visits, at short intervals, during the two or three weeks that elapsed before the patient was able to resume his journey. And it was during these vists, in which he had evidently found great favor in the eyes of both father and daughter, by the kindness and delicacy of his attentions, that he had contracted an intimacy with latter, which soon passed the ordinary boundaries of friendship, and ripened into that blissful state of the affections, which constitutes, perhaps, the most purely happy period in the course of love—when the feelings of parties are tacitly understood and appreciated by each other, before an open avowal occurs to throw with its business like aspect, the first shade of earth over this paradise of the heart. It was at this interesting stage of the intimacy that Warrington returned one day, after a longer absence than usual, and found, to his great disappointment and regret, that Hendee and his daughter had departed the day before, without leaving any note or message, as he then could learn, explanatory of their unannounced, and, to him unexpected departure. Believing from this, that he might have been perhaps deceived in regard to the nature and extent of the interest, which he had flattered himself he had created in the bosom of Miss Hendee, and feeling a little piqued at this appearance of neglect on the part of both father and daughter, he soon ceased his unavailing enquiries concerning the family. And he had never heard any thing further respecting them, or received the slightest information of the place of their subsequent residence, except the vague and uncertain information which he gathered in his adventure at the subteraneous abode before described, from that time to the present hour, when, to his utter surprise, he found them located on his own land. And now having no suspicion that they were conscious of intruding on the rights of another, and last of all, his own, in taking up this place under a York patent, and still cherishing all his former sentiments for the daughter, whose heart he believed he still retained notwithstanding the claims of another to her hand, he resolved to relinquish his right to the land, and even keep his ownership, if possible, a secret from the family, while he should prosecute his suit with the girl, at least till he had unravelled the mystery that now seemed to hang over her, and become better satisfied of the hopelessness of his case. Revolving this subject in his mind, he returned to his encampment, and announced to his wondering companions, that he should have no occasion to employ them in the affair which, as they were apprised, he had been to investigate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Let us be conjunctive in our revenge.” “'Tis lucky! I can work my purposes, While seeming but to do the state a service.” Perhaps there is no kind of hatred, that finds harbor in the human breast, more deadly and inveterate than that which is entertained by the perpetrators of base actions against those who have detected 11* them in guilt. Nor does the degree of inveteracy, with which this fiendish feeling is secretly cherished by the former, appear to be very often lessened by any forbearance which may be exercised by the latter in not exposing their baseness, or bringing them to punishment. We will not detain the reader, however, with any speculations of our own on this dark and somewhat singular leaf in the history of the human passions, but leave the subject to be illustrated by those incidents of our story, by which these remarks were here suggested. When the discomfitted soldier retreated from the presence of Warrington and the rescued maiden, he concealed himself in a thicket, from which he could espy the movements of the couple till they separated. And when this had taken place, he proceeded directly to his boat, and, entering it, pushed for the opposite shore, plying his oars with a sort of nervous and spiteful energy, as if impelled by the commingling feelings of chagrin and revenge, that were working within him at the thoughts of his defeat, and the conscionsness that he had disgraced himself forever in the eyes of the girl, as well as exposed himself to the contempt and abhorrence of her deliverer. `Fool! fool!' he angrily muttered to himself, as he urged his skiff through the waters, which, as if in mockery at the dark turmoil of his breast, were now sparkling in cheerful brightness in the rays of the setting sun; `stupid fool, to think a timid girl would listen to me in such a place! And more fool still to manage so blunderingly as to alarm her, when, if I had begun right, I might have told her all, or at least found out whether she would have made it to my advantage to do it. And then to mend the matter, I must try, in my eagerness, to stop her! which brought down that cursed interloper upon me, as if the old boy sent him just at that moment to make an affair out of the trifle! I wonder what they supposed I wanted to do?— that is plain, however, what they thought; but they are mistaken: Bill Darrow for once is accused of what he is not guilty! ha! ha! aint that a curiosity! Well, the plan, like every woman plan I ever laid, is all blown to the devil now, I suppose: though I can yet bring it about with the old man, if I choose. But that scoundrel, d—n him! whoever he may be, I'll dog him to the death, but I'll pay him for his rascally interference!' While thus reasoning and raving by turns, in the way of soothing his smarting feelings, he had nearly reached his destined landing, a small cove about a furlong north of the fort, when he caught a glimpse of a man standing among the bushes on the shore, apparently awaiting the approach of the boat. `Ah! who have we here?' resumed the desperado, as, shading his eyes with his hand from the blinding rays of reflected light that fell in his face, he threw a scrutinizing glance at the person of the other; `why! can it be?—it is—Jake Sherwood himself! What in the devil's name brought him here just at this time? Ah! my dear fellow, you may thank your good stars, and evil ones, that you are not by this time pretty devilishly well dished!— But can he have mistrusted my good will? No, no!—the secret is still my own, and for the present shall remain so, as my best stock in trade. Yet what can he want with me? Some beelzebub errand to be done, I'll warrant me! Well, he shall pay roundly for doing it, besides shelling out something more than promises on the old score, or I'll yet put him in a spot he will little relish, I am thinking.' `Well, Darrow,' said Sherwood, as the former now reached the shore, and, pulling up his boat, mounted the bank; `sporting a little over yonder this afternoon, eh? What luck? None!— Well, that is the way sometimes. But come, take a seat on this old log here, in the bushes. I should like a little talk with you; so lay aside that grim scowl of yours, and be sociable once, if you can.' `Sociable! hum! I should like to know who in hell could feel sociable, or wear a decent face while his conscience is loaded down with such soul-damning secrets as these of yours.' `My secrets! ha! ha!—as if they were not yours, too! `And they may be somebody's else, too, unless you mend your manners, and show yourself a little more liberal than you have been lately, Jake Sherwood. But what brings you here now, and what would you have with me?' `O, nothing very special—nothing of any great consequence'— `Nothing very special, hey? When did Jake Sherwood, or his father before him, ever call on Bill Darrow without a special object, I should like to know?' `Well, well, supposing I have an errand, what then?—what is there so out of the way in that, you surly one?' `Why, nothing out of the way, but exactly in the way, as I said. But what is the use of puttering with your round-about moonshine?—out with it!' `Darrow,' said the other, after glancing about him as if to make sure that there was no one within hearing; `there are several of the York outlaws prowling about Otter Creek. We came near seizing them a few days ago at lake Dunmore, though they escaped us, and that was not all—but no matter—they, day before yesterday, went down the Creek to the Lower Falls, and took, and laid waste colonel Reed's plantation there. And their leader, one Warrington, with part of his gang, has since moved off somewhere in this direction. Now there is a reward of about two hundred crowns to be had for taking this fellow. I have had my eye on him some time, and now I have some particular reasons for wishing him secured.' `What a kind of a looking fellow is he?' asked Darrow, with considerable interest. `Do you know him by sight?' `Yes—a tall, square built, and rather good looking fellow—that is, he might appear so to one who did not know him for a scoundrel.' `The same, by heavens!' exclaimed Darrow after musing a moment. `Yes, he must be the very fellow I saw not two hours ago, as I was skirting along Captain Hendee's clearing over yonder. He was walking with a woman near the woods.' `How! what woman?—not Alma Hendee?' `Can't say.' `No, no, it must have been the maid—and yet— but confound the audacious scoundrel, how came he there, and so soon acquainted with either maid or mistress, unless my suspicions are right?' `All that you can answer as well as I—though come to think more about the woman's make and gear, I'll be hanged if I dont believe that it was the old man's daughter.' `Fire and furies! it must be so.' `Why, what are you so wrathy about?' said Darrow, with a malicious smile. `You are not afraid the fellow will run away with your girl, are you, Jake?' `My girl! who told you so? Not mine, unless I please, I would have you to know! No, no, sir, no fear of this poltroon in that. But still I can't exactly comprehend the movement. If he was reconnoitering with a view to ousting the old man, would he be walking out so familiarly with his daughter? It don't look like it—no, it means something else, which must the sooner be seen to. And thanks to the rascal's boldness, he has put his fate in my power quicker than I expected.' `How—in what way?' `Why, don't you see, Bill?' said Sherwood, turning with a familiar and coaxing air to the minion, `dont you see how easily he can be entrapped, if he remains at Hendee's to night, or repeats his visit?' `Ay, but how would you manage the business?' `You are a sergeant—take a file of men, go over, surround the house and take him. Your superior won't object.' `But how am I to know when he is to be found there?' `I will go over myself, reconnoiter as soon as dark, without showing myself to alarm him, and if I find the game, be there, I will make a torch signal at the landing. You must keep watch, and as soon as you see the light, come over with your men. If he is not there to night, he will be soon: Alma Hendee is not a girl to be once seen and draw no second visit. Yes, by the powers of darkness, I have him at last! But supposing he does not come into this trap, he certainly is prowling somewhere near; and you can prowl too, Bill. And—and at the last pinch—you are a good rifle shot, I think, Darrow?' `Ha! ha! out at last then! I thought it would finally come to that. Jake Sherwood, you are a book that I can read by looking on the cover.' `Then you know what I would have you do.' `Yes, but where would be the reward in that case? The Yorkers don't pay for heads that have been bored, do they?' `The governor's proclamation dont say delivered alive, but only delivered. But whatever question there might be about that in some cases, there shall be no failure in this. I have influence enough at head quarters to see that your bill is footed, if you bring this about, in any shape.' `And you will do it?' `Upon honor.' `Upon interest, you mean.' `Upon both, if you please.' `That will do, and for this d—n'd good reason— if the security is weak, I know of that which can easily be made to enforce the bargain. Jake Sherwood, I am your man.' `Now that looks like a cheerful good will, without your usual drawback of grumbling. Well, we understand each other, do we?' `Hum! a d—n'd sight too well, Jake!' `Why, we part friends, don't we?' `Yes, and it rests with you whether we remain so. But I must be back to the fort. And, as it is getting dusk, you go directly over, I suppose?' `Soon—but you understand that we are to try to cage him at Hendee's, first. Remember to look out for the signal!' `Ay, ay!' `Yes, my suspicions were right about him and the girl,' soliloquized the plotting agent, after the departure of his reckless minion., But never mind, I have put the blood-hound on the scent; and if the animal don't forget his own nature, in addition to putting a stop to this business, I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing that haughty leader of these savage rebels atone for every blow which he caused to be inflicted on me at that accursed lake! And that jeering lieutenant and all the rest, reward or no reward, shall have their turn next. And then their executioner, if I can contrive to make the hated scoundrel such, must be made in some shape to follow them. Perhaps, however, he may be disposed of in the war, said to be brewing. At all events, he is too dangerous a fellow to my interests to be suffered to remain here long, to say nothing of the insults, which I am compelled to bear, and seem to take in good part, from his devil's tongue. I wonder, though, what made him undertake this dangerous business so readily?—the reward, I suppose;— well let him have it—revenge is dearer to me than money. But perhaps I can contrive it to get both —if I could but manage, after securing this renegade Captain, to make Darrow and some of the rest mutual executioners—ha! that would be gloririous! But of that hereafter, now for the first object.' So saying, and partially arousing himself from his reverie, he proceeded along the shore a few rods to a point where he had left his skiff, and, entering it, began to pull slowly for the residence, on the opposite shore, already described, to which we will next take the reader, for the purpose of introducing some new characters, and making the place the future scene of a large portion of the incidents to follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “I prythee daughter, do not make me mad.” It was on the second evening after the incidents related in the two preceding chapters occurred, that an elderly gentleman sat at the door of the pleasantly situated cottage before described, quietly indulging in the habit-made luxury of puffing the Indian weed, as, enjoying the bland breezes of the evening, he caimly looked out upon the broad expanse of the lake, and the diversified objects of the landscape around, over which the shades of night were now rapidly gathering. Now his eye-lids would droop, and his head sink, slightly, towards his breast, under the sedative influence of the narcotic fumes he was imbibing, aided by the cesaeless croakings of the frogs, whose evening choruses rose from the marshy shores of the lake in drowsy monotony on the ear. And now he would partially arouse, and his eye would light up, for an instant, with returning consciousness, as his ear caught the new note of some bird of passage just returned from his hibernal flight to the warm south, and now for the first time heard, marking the progress of the season. The man might have been sixty, though his appearance indicated a greater number of years; for his head 12 was nearly white with the frosts that the fatigues and privations of the camp, in which the vigor of his manhood had been spent, had prematurely sprinkled on his head. And yet, his erect figure, and keenly flashing eye, as his attention became aroused to objects around him, betokened a spirit still unbroken, and intellects still unimpaired, in despite of a shattered constitution, and the ravages which hardship and time had depicted on his thin, and war-worn visage. Though at the same time, the rapid play of the muscles of his face, and the combined expression of every feature of his countenance, evidently denoted that, with fine sensibilities, and much that was generous and noble, he naturally possessed a sanguine temperament and a firey disposition, which his growing infirmities had rendered still more erascible. And such was indeed the case with Captain Hendee, the person whose appearance we have been endeavoring to describe. His life had been one which had been checkered with no ordinary vicissitudes. He had been an officer in the colonial army, and out in most of that fearful struggle with the French and Indians, that, with little intermission, spread death and desolation through all the borders of the English colonies in America from 1744 to 1760; and he had suffered imprisonment, sickness, and all but death, in that terrible warfare. He had also known the extremes of affluence and poverty in his pecuniary affairs; while great felicity, and uncommon bereavements, had marked his domestic relations. He had buried two wives—each, while she was spared him, the charm of his existence. And to add still more to his cup of sorrows, a darling son, who had been entrusted to the care of an uncle in his father's absence, soon unaccountably disappeared, having been abducted and murdered, it was supposed, by some lurking band of Indians. One daughter, the child of his last wife, was now all that remained to him to smoothe the pillow of age, and prop his declining years. And well did that beloved and truly lovely daughter fulfil the filial trust thus imposed. Aware of her parent's infirmities, as well of temper as of body, she became the gentle soother of the one, and the watchful nurse of the other. And ever manifesting the most affectionate solicitude for his welfare, and always assiduously attentive to his slightest wants and wishes, while readily overlooking the harshness, which, in his fits of petulance, he occasionally showed her, and which she generally answered only with a tear, she gained over him, by this, and the super-added influence of his affection for her, and his sense of dependance on her for happiness, a control for his good, that the whole world united would have failed in attempting to obtain. A discreet and demure maiden of about thirty, an old servant, who lived with them in more prosperous days, still remained with them, and, with one more person scarcely less regarded, completed all the permanent members of the family. That other person was no other than Neshobee, the young Indian, with whom the reader has already had a partial acquaintance, without having been before apprised, however, we believe, of his residence. He was one of Captain Hendee's trophies of war, having been captured in an onset on an Indian lodge, to which a band of murderers had been traced after one of their masacres on the frontier settlement. The Indians being taken wholly by surprise, and nearly all slain by the first fire, this lad was found burrowed unhurt in a pile of dry leaves in one of their haunts, and secured by the victors; when the Captain declared, with a sort of melancholly jest, that as the hell-hounds, a year or two before, had deprived him of a son of about the same age, he would for once follow their custom of supplying the place of the slain by adopting one captured from the enemy. And accordingly he took the boy, then six or eight years old, back with him to his post, and finally to his family, with whom the captive had ever since resided. The domicil of this strikingly contrasted family was a common cottage, constructed after the fashion of the better sort of houses in the settlement, of hewn timber, so exactly squared and laid together, in the present instance, as to make smooth, compact walls, neatly white-washed without, and tightly ceiled with boards within. The interior, which was divided into two principal rooms, parlor and kitchen, with a range of bed rooms and other small apartments abreast, exhibited an odd mingling of the relics of refined life with the crude substitutes for furniture, and the various articles usually found in the houses of a border settlement. On the high mantle-piece of the best room stood the wide-spreading antlers of some noble buck, the tips of the various branches being ornamented with curious sea-shells, the egg-shells of rare birds, and other devices of the tasteful young mistress of the establishment.— Rich mahogany chairs were cushioned with the feathered skins of the loon, a large water-fowl abounding in our northern lakes, and remarkable for the thickness and tenacity of its skin, as well as for the downy softness of its feathers. A light stand, of exquisite workmanship, was supplied with a curiously beaded miniature Indian canoe for a tray, containing a pair of small clam shells for snuffers. On wooden pegs in the wall were suspended the remains of a once superb mirror, the broken parts of which were artfully concealed by festoons of the creeping evergreen; while, on one side, a small, but well selected assortment of books, arranged on broad shelves, completed the list of all the prominent articles by which the room was furnished. The furniture of the kitchen was mostly of the roughest kind; and the whole room abounded with evidences of the woodman's life, the walls and ceiling above being hung with implements of hunting, furs, pieces of drying venison, and other trophies of the chase, taken by Neshobee, the young Esau, or red Nimrod, if the reader please, of the family. `Come, father,' said Miss Hendee, with a look of affectionate solicitude, as, rolling up her needlework, she rose from her seat by his side: `had you not better take a seat within; I fear you are exposing yourself too much to the night air to expect quiet from your rheumatic shoulders to-morrow.' `No, Alma,' replied the old gentleman, knocking the ashes from his pipe, `I know just what I can bear: Old Fahrenheit himself could not make an instrument that would indicate the state of the air, whether hot or cold, dry or humid, more exactly than these sensitive fluids in my old shattered frame. No, the atmosphere is peculiarly soft and warm this evening. I think old Boreas has nearly lost his claws for this season. I just heard a whippoorwill, or muckawis, as the Indians call it, which they say never appears here in the spring till winter has got so far towards the big ice-pond on his return to the north, that he will no more come back.' 12* `I knew it was very mild to night, father, but I thought, perhaps, you were not aware how late you were remaining in the open air, since you appeared so deeply engaged in cogitation.' `True, girl, I have been thinking over matters a little.' `What matters, father—may I know?' `Yes,' replied the other, now rising and following his daughter into the room we first described, `yes, Alma, you shall know, for you are, yourself, one of the parties concerned.' `I, father?' `Yes, you are, girl; but in the first place let me ask you, if you did not think your cousin Sherwood's manner, in his visit last night, rather singular?' `I might have thought so, perhaps—in what respect did you imagine his manner was singular, however?' `In several—what was it that he seemed to be hinting about so mysteriously? And did he not have the air of one who is secretly suspicious of something?' `Does my father,' replied the other, evading a direct answer, `does my father think that any thing very singular in Mr. Sherwood?' `Why—why'—said the Captain surprised and staggered at the question: `Why yes, I had hoped so; for these secretly suspecting characters I dislike, Alma, you know. Confound them, yes, I detest them!' `And I,' rejoined the girl with a smile, in which the jocose and serious were significantly blended, `I am too much my father's daughter, I confess, to think otherwise, myself.' `Why! what? how?' hastily exclaimed the Captain, puzzled and uneasy at the remark of the other. `Why, what on earth can this all mean. No rupture brewing between you and Jake, is there?' `Not that I am aware of, as far as there are any ties to sever—or, at least, none that I, as yet, have been the just cause of, though'— `Though what?' sharply demanded the father, with increasing irritation: `Zounds! you don't think the fellow is trying to claw off do you? Curse the hollow hearted—humph,' what was I going to say?' `Nothing but the truth, father, I presume,' answered Alma, looking up with a faint smile and a sort of cool desperation in her manner. `Yes, I was!' quickly rejoined the other, hitching about in his chair. `Blast it! girl, why didn't you tell me I lied?' `What, tell my father he lied!' said the girl, roguishly: `no, no! that would have been the worst of manners.' `Yes, yes,' pettishly returned the Captain, `but why don't you stand up for him? I don't like this don't care a fig sort of way you have about the business. Hang me, if I don't believe you are the one, after all, who wishes to be off?' `And would you object to my trying to get the start of him?' again evasively replied the girl, `if I believed he was intending to desert me?' `Why, no'—answered the other, `not that I know of; no, that would be, perhaps, a decent finesse, if that was the case; but it is not. Then what is all this bothering and teasing me for?'—he continued, in a vexed and expostulating tone; `this supposing things that are not so? You will work me up to a fever; make me mad, march mad, without letting me know which of you to be mad at. 'Tis provoking; insufferable, girl! Why not tell me in your usual direct off-hand way, at once, how the matter stands between you and Jake?' `Father,' said Alma seriously, `I most certainly would tell you, if I knew myself.' `Well, if that don't cap the whole, now!' said the Captain, eyeing his daughter with an incredulous and somewhat contemptous expression, `a courted girl know nothing of her own courtship! Your caged squirrel, that hangs in the kitchen yonder, knows nothing of nuts, does he?' `Now, father you wrong me,' said the other, a little piqued at the taunt, and now perceiving the necessity of being more explicit on a subject, which she felt reluctant to discuss, lest she should, by such frankness as she could wish to use, displease her sensitive parent. `Mr. Sherwood once certainly made me proposals; and I, knowing how much you had the project at heart, acquiesced, or rather, I did not reject him; since that time he has not often reminded me of the subject. His own affairs he keeps to himself; and a few silly compliments on his part completes the whole story of what you call our courtship.' `Beggarly account!' muttered the Captain, with an air of disappointment, `beggarly account, as the fellow says in the play: cold business this, for a love affair, or I am no judge, I'll be shot if I am! But zounds!' he continued, again kindling up, `Why, I thought it was all a settled business! And it was settled—and would be now, if your powers of winning were exerted to have it so! What will become of us the Lord only knows, if this falls through.' `O, I would borrow no trouble on that score, Sir,' observed Alma. `But I shall though'—rejoined the other. `The truth is, Alma, we are poor—poor as Job, when the devil had done his damnedest! We owe Jake's father, which, as he is sole heir, is the same as Jake himself, for nearly all we have. If my little Edward could have been spared me—but the noble boy is gone; and that family have been the vortex in which all my property and expectations have been swallowed up: I do not say that the property went wrongfully; but it went. Even before Jake came here, I had thought of the possibility, that you might become the channel by which this property would be diverted back again into my family. And when he made proposals to you, and I understood you accepted them, I confess I was gratified. It gladdened my old desolate and despairing heart with the thought that it would ensure my comfort in my decripit and helpless old age, while it would give you the home and wealth which I never could furnish you; and now to have the only bright streak I have seen for years in my dark future, suddenly blotted out—to have the only pleasant cup that has been presented to me for so long, thus dashed from my very lips!— And by whose hand?' he added, with startling fierceness, as, trembling with rising passion, he shook his clenched fist before the face of his unoffending daughter. `By whose hand, I say? Girl, girl, if I really thought'— `I will marry him, father,' replied the girl bursting into tears, which were drawn forth more, however, by the picture he had drawn of his hopes and sorrows, than by his menaces; `O, I will—I will marry him, for your sake, dear father, if it breaks my heart!' `Hang it! no, you shant!' exclaimed the excited old man, touched to the quick at the sight of his daughter's tears, and his whole feelings undergoing a revulsion as sudden as rose the tempest of his passion; `no, you sha'nt! Brand me for a brute, if you shall! No—no—no'—he repeated till his increasing emotion fairly choked his utterance, and he could articulate no more. The tide of passion, having risen to its height, was now left to subside in the pause that followed. `Let us now dismiss this painful subject from our thoughts,' at length said the daughter, the first to recover her composure; `and do not let the matter further disturb your feelings, my dear and generous-hearted father: For whatever be the final result, rest assured, that I will never marry without your full consent.' `Dutiful—noble girl!' sobbed the old man, dashing away a tear; `God has left me a consolation in you, my dear daughter, which I ought to be thankful for, and which, but for my accursed temper, I should repay with better treatment.' `O, do not name it, father, do not name it,' replied the daughter with a sweet and cheering smile; `if we should go upon faults, I may have scores of them, any of which, perhaps, would outweigh the solitary one you tax yourself with.' Miss Hendee had never before ventured so far in manifesting a disposition to thwart the known feelings and wishes of her irritable father. But her late accidental interview with Warrington, whom she never expected again to see, had forced upon her mind a comparison between her two lovers, which made her more painfully sensible than ever how much she must sacrifice in becoming the wife of Sherwood, whose true character, as deeply veiled as he had endeavored to keep it with this family, she had in some measure penetrated, and she could not forego this opportunity of letting her father see how heavy upon her heart hung the chain, that she was wearing only out of regard to his happiness; and yet scarcely more now than before, did she meditate on throwing off this chain, by which she had passively suffered herself to be bound. But determining to defer any consummation, which might, for the present, be urged upon her, she suffered herself only to hope the event of circumstances more auspicious for reconciling the now conflicting duties, which she owed herself, and, with all his faults, her still loved parent. After the conversation just detailed, the parties soon repaired to the kitchen, where, in his great arm-chair before the cheerful fire, the Captain was accustomed to spend his evenings, sometimes listening to the silver-toned voice of his daughter as she sung some favorite song, or read some favorite author, and sometimes recounting the thrilling incidents, that had marked his adventures while battling the subtle foe of the wilderness. One of his most attentive auditors, when engaged in the latter employment, was Neshobee, with whom the veteran also often amused himself in conversation, either imparting information to the native, or listening to the shrewd and original remarks made by the latter in answer to the various questions by which he was purposely interrogated. Perceiving now, however, that the place of this almost necessary adjunct to his happiness was vacant, the Captain immediately inquired of Ruth, the servant maid before mentioned, if she knew whither the Indian had gone. `He is out in the field, Captain,' replied the person addressed, with some signs of uneasiness in her looks, `and I wonder what strange thing he sees or hears to-night, that makes him act so oddly? I have been out, and called to him; but he paid no attention to me, and kept on his pranks, sometimes listening with his ear to the ground, and then dodging or crawling from one stump to another.' `Aha?' said the Captain, with a look of interest; `those are generally pranks that mean something with an Indian. I wonder who can be prowling about us now?' `Mercy!' exclaimed Ruth in alarm; `if it should be the Green Mountain Boys!— `The worst would be their own, I think,' coolly observed the Captain; `that is, if they come to show us such play as it is said they have shown some on Otter Creek.' `What would you do, father, in case they should come on such an errand?' asked Alma, with an air of mingled curiosity and concern. `What would I do, child? Why, I would put a rifle bullet through the first one who should attempt to enter, even if it should be Warrington himself. Besure, I know but little of this cursed dispute about titles. They may have as much right to lands that they have bought, and first improved, as the Yorkers, for aught that I know; and I was never for hanging them for fighting in such a case. But here—why, zounds! do you think when I have got the first possession, and done so much upon the place, that I am a going to give it up to the greedy dogs? No! not if their great devil and all generalissamo, Ethan Allen, should come on with all his forces, would I give it up without a fight! Hoo!— they shall have my heart's blood first!' `I trust there will be no necessity for bloodshed any where, father, rejoined the daughter quite composedly; `I have reason to—that is, I do not believe the Green Mountain Boys will make the least attempt to molest us.' `Well—well, girl,' said the Captain, scanning the other closely, and at first with rather a puzzled air, which soon, however, gave way to a look of approbation; `I must say that does not seem much like borrowing trouble, as most of you women do in such cases. However, I have been taught by the Indians, and sometimes have paid dear for my schooling too, that this borrowing trouble is not always so bad a thing after all; as it generally keeps us well guarded against a surprise. But here comes our scout; so let us hear his report. Well, Neshobee, they say you are scouting to-night—what is in the wind?' `Me hark um, but no tell um,' replied the Indian, quietly taking his place by the fire. The dog in the yard now gave one of those faint, indecisive sort of yelps, usual with the animal when doubtful whether he has heard something that should require his notice. `Beagle thinks pretty much as you do, Neshobee,' said the Captain, comprehending the tone of the dog: `But hark!' he added, as the animal barked again, and in a more decided manner; `I can't read that so easily. What do you make of it, boy?' `Beag say that no four foot coming, Cappen,' said the native unconcernedly. `Is the rifle well loaded Neshobee?' asked the Captain, glancing at the firearms suspended by hooks on the wall. 10 `Yas!' `And the fowling piece?' `Me spose um.' `Very well, down with them then! Alma, step and bring me my pistols! and in the mean time we will bar the door—Ruth lend a hand! If these fellows,' continued the Captain, coolly assissting to exto execute the several commands he had so rapidly given to his household—`if these fellows had any honest errand, they would come up to the house at once, like men, instead of skulking around at a distance, as they evidently are. We may as well be prepared for them.' `Father,' said Alma returning with the required pistols, and now manifesting the most lively concern. `Father, I do beg of you not to think of firing on any one rashly—ascertain what they want, at all events. Your apprehensions, I think, are wholly groundless—I cannot think—indeed I am very sure'— A gentle rap, rap, rap! on the outside of the door caused the speaker suddenly to suspend. All now stood hushed in silence, till the rapping was repeated, in several louder and more distinct knocks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. “But who was he, that on his hunting spear Lean'd with a prouder and more fiery bearing? His was a brow for tyrant-hearts to fear, Within the shadow of its dark locks wearing That which they may not tame—a soul declaring War against earth's oppressors.” `Hallo, there'! called out Captain Hendee, in no very gentle tones, as he cocked his pistols, and threw himself into an attitude of defence. `Hallo! who comes?' `No enemy, to say the least,' answered the voice without. `Let him in, father, do let him in!' said Miss Hendee in a low beseeching tone. `What, without giving his name!' said the Captain. `Why, child, I don't know that voice from Adam's! No, no, friend or foe, he shall undergo that ceremony.' `Well, father, you can just ask him, without being so rough, can't you?' interposed the daughter, in an earnest half whisper, quietly placing her hand on the arm of the other. `Friend,' said Captain Hendee, softening down at the entreaties of his daughter, and as it occurred to him that the tones of the voice he had just heard were entirely of a pacific character; `friend, will you favor us with your name?' `Captain Hendee,' said the man, seeming to hesitate about complying, `I am wholly unattended, your dog here seems to acknowledge my acquaintance, and if you will not do the same, when I am admitted,' he added in rather a jocose tone, `I will agree to depart as peacibly as I came.' `Humph! me know that man talk! Him no bad!' said the Indian, with a low chuckle. The Captain, now, evidently a little chagrined at the suspicions he had entertained, and the parade he had made, immediately drew out the bar, and opened the door; when the visitor entered, but quickly paused, after entering the threshold to receive the scrutinizing look of the other. `What! no—yes, 'tis!' exclaimed Hendee, between perplexity and surprise, after looking a few seconds into the face of the new-comer. `Well, now, by the great Jupiter! if I am not absolutely ashamed of myself! Mr. Howard!' he continued, advancing, and cordially shaking the other by the hand, `Mr, Howard, God bless you, sir, how do you do? Apologies by the dozen are yours!—or should be, if such moon-shine concerns were ever worth offering. But walk in, walk in, sir. Here are my family—all together now—they were not when you saw us, I think. Alma, you are acquainted with—Miss Ruth, this is Mr. Howard. And here is another, Neshobee, we call him, a native, as you perceive, but for all that an adopted member of our family.' Miss Hendee, though much embarrassed at this meeting, in spite of all her attempts to appear composed, managed nevertheless to exchange the customary salutations in such a manner as to conceal her embarrassment from all except her lover; between whom and herself it seemed to be tacitly understood that they should meet each other as for the first time, without making the slightest allusion to their late interview. There was nother of the family group also, that came in for his share of surprise, at least, at some of the circumstances attending this meeting. And that was the Indian. Not expecting to see Warrington here till he heard his voice at the door, and never dreaming till this moment but that the latter and his master's family were entire strangers, the poor fellow, when he saw them meet as old acquaintances, and above all, when he heard Captain Hendee address the other by the name of Howard, looked perfectly confounded, and expressed as much unfeigned astonishment as an Indian countenance, perhaps, ever exhibited. The instinctive prudence of his race, howeverer, prevented him from betraying, by words, his surprise and perplexity, or exposing Warrington in the disguise which he supposed was for some good reasons assumed. `Well, Mr. Howard,' resumed the Captain, after the usual salutations were over, `I am right happy to renew my acquaintance with you, and have the opportunity to express personally, my obligations to you for your many kindnesses to us at the time of my accident on the road. You probably thought our departure rather abrupt on your return. But you received my note, did you not?' `No, sir, neither note nor message.' `What! then that old heedless poodle of a landlady forgot it, or more probably lost it, and to mend the matter, thought she would conceal from you that I gave her one. Well, well, you must have thought us rather singular beings, as well for that as for some other things you perhaps noticed in us. For I remember, we kept you pretty much in the dark about our affairs. The fact was, Mr. Howard, and I care not now who knows it, that I was then under the apprehension 13 of being pursued and taken back by creditors, before I could reach my connexions in Albany, where I expected to obtain the means of satisfying them, as I did, before making this purchase.' `You did not return then?' `No! When I arrived there, finding that sales were making in these lands, I concluded on a life in the woods—made a purchase—came on here the first season with hired men, and then sent for Alma from Albany, and the rest of the family and goods from Connecticut.' `And what directed you particularly to this location?' `My own knowledge of the country, obtained in the wars when I was campaigning with Put and Rogers along the borders of this then bloody lake. I remembered this spot well. A pitch had been made here by some Frenchmen, who cleared up seval acres, lived here a few years, and then deserted the place. This was the first opening made this side of the Connecticut river, all the rest of the country being, at the time I first saw the spot, one broad, unbroken wilderness. Many a weary march, and many a cold, wet bed, have I had on these dark and tangled shores. I have often wondered how we could have outlived such hardships. With the constitution and spirits I then possessed, however, I had but little dread of the woods, or the red imps that infested them. But my days of fighting are now over, Mr. Howard.' `Some, in my situation, with these evidences around, might feel disposed to doubt that, Captain,' smilingly observed Warrington motioning to the fire-arms, which had not been yet replaced. `Ah, you have me there,' gaily responded the other; `but honestly, we were expecting visits of a different character. If those rough dealing devils, the Green Mountain Boys, had beset us, instead of our peaceable old friend, Dr. Hunter, there is no telling but even so broken down an old Trojan, as I am, might have shown some fight on the occasion.' `Perhaps, sir,' replied the guest in the same spirit; `I should tender my condolence at your disappointment in not being allowed the chance to exercise your old vocation.' `Not a whit, not a whit, sir: For I should extremely regret to be forced into a quarrel with my countrymen in defence of what I consider my rightful possessions. And I hope it may never be the case. But we have had some reasons to believe otherwise within a day or two past. A friend apprised me, that a band of these fellows was abroad, and probably on their way to this part of the lake shore; and our two scouts here, Neshobee and Beagle, having successively made their reports, in their respective fashions, to-night, that there were skulkers in the bush, I, for one, began really to expect that we had got to do battle for our home. Alma here, however, I am half ashamed to own, was less apprehensive, and bore herself more coolly than any of the garrison, not excepting the old soldier of forty battles at their head! Hang me! if I do'nt believe the girl, like old Falstaf, knew by instinct who was coming! Come, child, now be honest, was it not so?' But Alma, whose head suddenly dropped at the remark, and whose fair cheek glowed like the fire before which she was sitting, was quite too busy with her pretty fingers in tumbling over the contents of her work-basket for a thimble, or some other article, that became just at that moment unaccountably missing, to heed the question, or think of answering it. Even Warrington appeared to be a little discomposed at this close, though random shot of the old Captain; but he did not forget to throw a glance of gratitude towards his fair friend for the confidence, which the Captain's statement seemed to imply that she had placed in his assurances at their late interview. Captain Hendee, without seeming to notice the sensation which his last remarks, intended only for a passing joke, produced on some of his auditors, at length resumed; `You wandered roand the borders of the woods some time before you found us, I conclude, sir, from the noises that Neshobee heard previous to your arrival?' `O, no, sir, I came direct, and without stopping.' `I do'nt see, then, but we have as much reason now, as before, to expect a visit from the enemy to-night,' musingly observed the Captain. `Me guess um what I hear no Mountain Boys,' said Neshobee, looking significantly at Warrington, as if he considered the latter to have the most interest in the information thus imparted. Neither the remark of the Indian, nor the meaning look that accompanied it, was lost on Warrington, as was evident from the expression of uneasiness, that, for an instant, became visible on his countenance; but he remained silent. `Which way did you come, Mr. Howard?' resumed the Captain; `I believe you have not told us, nor, indeed, how you became apprised of our present residence?' Warrington, catching a forbidding glance from Miss Hendee, was hesitating, on her account as well as his own, what answer he should frame to the embarrassing question, when he was suddenly relieved from his dilemma by a bold, heavy rap at the door. Captain Hendee feeling more assured this time from the reinforcement received in his friend Howard, who as usual had his rifle with him, immediately rose, and, with but a slight hesitation, opened the door; when he suddenly paused, and stood a moment gazing in mute surprise at the figure before him. Soon recovering, however, he, in a sort of hesitating and doubtful tone, invited the man to enter. Acknowledging the proffered courtesy with a stately bow, the stranger advanced, with a bold, free step, and a fearless air, into the middle of the room, where he paused, and bowed slightly to each of the assembled group, most of whom, however, were too much surprised, and over-awed at the singular and formidable appearance of the man to return his salutations. And indeed his appearance was of so unique and striking a character as well to warrant the sensation which his presence seemed to produce. Of an uncommon height, and with an extraordinary breadth of chest, supplied with large brawny limbs, his whole frame constituted a figure of the most Herculean cast; while his large, darkly bright eyes, and the air of inteligence that marked the general expression of his coarse, lion-like features, gave evidence, that his intellectual powers were not, as frequently occurs in such instances, wholly incommensurate with his physical proportions. A modern phrenologist, indeed, while comparing his high, and remarkably expansive forehead, with the vast volume which composed the back part of his head, might be much puzzled to decide whether his intellectual or animal nature would most predominate in his character. His dress, which was likewise somewhat singular for the times, consisted of high, heavy boots, buff breeches and doublet, with a high collared, white shag coat of the frock kind, all of which was surmounted by a fine, though much worn beaver, slouched, except the front part, which was turned up so as to give an additional boldness to his large features, and to impart somewhat of a bandit aspect to his appearance. This, to ordinary observation, completed his outward equipment; though a closer inspection might have revealed the shape of a stout pistol swelling the smooth and snugly s tting leather over each of his breeches pockets, while the buck-horn handle of a large war-knife might occasionally be seen protruding from its sheath attached to the side lining of his coat. Placing the heavy rifle which he bore in his hand in a corner, the stranger now advanced, and, with an air of easy unconcern, seated himself by the side of his host in the family circle round the fire. `My name is Hendee,' at length said the Captain, evidently not wholly at case in the presence of his bold and fearful looking visitor, `my name is Hendee, and being no great stickler for ceremony, I hope I shall be excused, Sir, in saying that it always affords me pleasure to know by what name I may address my guests.' That's right?' bluntly commenced the stranger in reply, `and you got at it ingeniously too, by George!' `I meant no offence, Sir.' `O, no, but let me see—it is now May, is it not?' `Yes, Sir.' `Well, then, for the month of May, my name is Smith.' `Sir?—did I rightly understand you, Sir?' `I presume so—I said Smith, because there are more of that name than any other.' `Yes Sir, but what follows from that?' `Why, of course Sir, that you stand a better chance to get my right name: men will lie like the devil, sometimes, you know! `Really, Sir! said the Captain,' his eyes beginning to shoot fire at this apparently intended insult, `really, Sir, I cannot understand your drift, if you do not mean to offer us an affront.' `Ha! ha! ha! roared the stranger in a voice that shook the house, `well, now, if that ain't a good one! ha! ha! ha! Why, no, friend,' he continued familiarly turning towards the other, and giving him a rough slap on the shoulder, `no, no, friend; but you just said you was no great stickler for ceremony —no ain't I, as you see. So let us be honest and live up to our professions.' `Agreed to that. And yet'—rejoined the Captain, perfectly at a loss what to make of his strange guest, and though still veved, yet now half ashamed of the feeling he had shown—`and yet, Sir, I have met, in the course of my life, but with few honest men, who were afraid to tell their names.' `Why, the truth is,' replied the other with an air of much seriousness, `that you are all such quarrelsome curses, down here in the Grants, that a stranger, like myself, can't safely travel among you by any other name than Smith, if he had one. As to myself I don't exactly know, in the strictly legal sense of the thing, that I have any name—to speak of, except Smith; for I still stick to Smith, mind ye —that is, for the month of May.' `Well, well, have it as you will, man,' observed Hendee, now softening down, and beginning to be amused in spite of himself at the blunt drollery of the other. `But I must say you are the greatest oddity I have met with, for many a day.' `That may be friend,' said the stranger, his countenance assuming the cast of sincerity; `but as you, like a wise man, have concluded not be offended at nonsense, let us talk sense a little: Captain Hendee, a man of your intelligence and observation cannot but have long since noticed the quarrel that has been brewing between us colonists, and the mother country?' `I have, Sir; and with the most painful regret,' was the guarded reply. `And those Bostonians and Virginians, who have taken the lead in the resistance to the King's authority,' resumed the stranger again assuming an equivocal look, and fixing his eyes keenly on the countenance of the other, `those fellows are a set of Chritless knaves, for their rebellion, you agree?' `Knaves! How so, Sir?' replied the Captain hastily, and with a look that betrayed more of his feelings than he intended should have been revealed to a stranger, and especially to one who apparently entertained sentiments on this subject so different from those which he had long privately cherished. `Aha!' eagerly exclaimed the stranger with eviident delight, `sits the wind in that quarter, really, and truly?' Well, I am not disappointed in you, after all, thank God!' Yes, but you, Sir?'—said the Captain, again confounded at the seemingly contradictory language and manner of the other, `what did you say but a moment since?' `What did I say?' O, pooh! that is nothing!' replied the stranger. `But again, and seriously, Captain Hendee, (for I am now satisfied that it will do to ask you the question) should matters proceed to open hostilities in an attempt to burst these accursed fetters, how far could your countenance and support be depended on?' `Stranger,' said Captatn Hendee, looking the other full in the face `as singular a man as you appear, you nevertheless have an honest countenance, and would not, I think, try, in my own house, to lead me into a snare. But granting that your sentiments and mine coincide on this subject, what could you ask, or expect, from an infirm, old man, whose only home and property lie under the very mouths of the guns of Fort Frederick?'[2] [2] The Fort at Crown Point was, in the old French wars, denominated Fort Frederick. `I see, I see!' answered the stranger. `But it may be worth much to us to know that your heart is in the right spot: For the times are coming when even what such as you can do, may be of incalculable importance to the cause. Indeed, Sir,' he continued with increasing carnestness, and with deep and startling emphasis, `indeedSir, those times are already at the door: Blood—American blood has been shed!' `Where? where?' simultaneously burst from the lips of Hendee and Warrington. `At Lexington,' resumed the stranger with clenched fist and eye of fire. `Fifty American citizens have been shot down like wild cattle by a foreign 14 soldiery! and their blood has gone up to the great God, in cries of vengeance! All Massachusetts are in arms! And are we here of the Green Mountains to remain idle?' he added, with a look and a tone of almost frightful energy; `by all the thrones of heaven and hell, no, no! `O, for the renovation of one year of my manhood's vigor!' exclaimed the Captain, springing from his chair, and hastily striding round the room. `All that is well enough, but useless, my friend,' observed the stranger, after a silence among the company of a few moments, in which he seemed to have brought his feelings back to their usual current: `so instead of calling on Hercules, like the man of the fable, in prayers that never can be answered, be thinking what you can do. This Indian'—he continued, in an under tone, approaching close to the Captain—`he is domesticated in your family?' `Yes, brought up by us, mostly; a cunning, prudent and faithful fellow,' replied the Captain, in a voice too low to be heard, as he supposed, by the rest of the company. `And may be made a useful friend for some emergencies, with your permission, Captain?' `You have it, that is for an occasional runner, scout, or the like—I should not like to part with him for any great length of time, however.' `Here my friend,' said the stranger, approaching the native, and presenting him with a valuable pocket knife, `will you take this as a gift to remember me by? Now look me in the face.' `Yas—umph! Ah, him good—one very good!' said the Indian, quickly pocketing the knife. `Now Captain,' said the stranger, putting on his hat, and giving other indications of his intention to depart, `I have only to say, that I am sorry I could not have been more frank with you in some particulars; but circumstances forbade it. Now I must be off; `and I have some notion,' he continued, looking at Warrington, `of inviting your guest here to accompany me as a guide.' `Mr. Howard is an old acquaintance, Sir, just called after a long separation,' said the Captain. `We should be sorry to part with him so soon.' `Mr. Howard will remain through the night with us, surely?' interposed the musical voice of Miss Hendee. The stranger gave a scrutinizing look at the father and the daughter, and ended by exchanging with Warrington looks of intelligence, which very clearly showed that the two were by no means strangers to each other. Seeming to satisfy himself, he was about to remark further, when the tramp of men, now heard approaching the door, arrested the attention of the company. The rattling of guns announced them to be armed men, among whose voices the quick ears of Miss Hendee recognized that of Darrow. Instantly rising, she hastily invited Warrington to take a seat in the other room; and the latter complying, the lovers disappeared through one door, just as new comers entered another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “Ha! here come those we counted not on meeting!” The company, whose arrival was announced at the close of the last chapter, proved to be a small detachment of soldiers from the opposite Fort. They were seven or eight in number, under the command of their sergeant, Darrow, who, with three others, after knocking, though scarcely waiting for a bidding, unceremoniously entered the kitchen, the remainder of the force having been posted at the doors and windows without, to prevent all escape from the house. As an ostensible reason for calling at this time, Darrow carelessly observed that being out in pursuit of a deserter, a part of their company had gone up the lake with their boat, thus depriving them of the means of recrossing, and leaving them no other resort but to crave a shelter of Captain Hendee for the night, or, at least, till their boat returned. Calls of this kind by the officers and soldiers of the garrison being of no very unfrequent occurrence at the house, the present visit, therefore, occasioned the Captain little or no surprise, and being of a hospitable turn, and fond, as might be supposed, of having those for company, who belonged to a profession, in which a great portion of his own life had been spent, he appeared to feel quite at case with his new guests. Not so, however, with all the company assembled. The meeting between the soldiers, and the stout stranger before described, seemed to be mutually unexpected, and evidently but little relished by the latter: For, though they were all personally unknown to him; yet he was aware that he might not be so to them: and, should the last supposition be true, as, from certain sly looks, which he saw exchanged between the soldiers, he thought highly probable, he was sensible that he had a part to play for himself, and Warrington, of whose co-operation he felt assured, that would require all his tact, and perhaps put to the severest test the powers of both to extricate them from the threatened difficulty. Nor were the stranger's suspicions by any means groundless. Darrow had before seen the man, and at once recognized him as one, who, if taken, would prove a far greater prize than the person whose seizure constituted the particular object of the present visit; but one, at the same time, well known to be the most formidable, and difficult of capture, of all the Green Mountain outlaws. `That ain't the fellow we came for,' whispered Darrow to the soldier nearest him, the first opportunity that occurred for so doing unobserved. `He must be with the girl in the other room, I think. But this big chap is one of the same kidney, only worth two of him if taken; secure him, as well as the other, and your pay shall be doubled. So keep your eyes on him for the present, and we will wait till they go to bed, and get to sleep: For the other is no baby for a tussle; and this one,' he continued, with a significant look, as he east a fearful glance at the giantlike person of the stranger; `and this one, to say nothing of the ugly instruments they say he carries under his clothes, he is—he's the devil and all —he's thunder!' This information, with the orders accompanying 14* it, being soon passed around to all the band, every movement of the stranger was regarded with the most suspicious vigilance. But he, contrary to their expectation, made not the slightest movement, which indicated that he was meditating any attempt to escape. On the contrary, the more he was watched, the more unconscious did he seem, that he was an object of suspicion or vigilance with any of the company; and with the utmost unconcern, he soon began to mingle in the conversation, commencing with those blunt, cordial kind of advances to Darrow, and as many of his men as he could find excuse for addressing individually, which are generally the surest, if not the only road to the soldier's heart. Nor was it long before he had succeeded in putting himself on a familiar footing with the whole band, whose feelings and senses, in spite of the distant restraint, and guarded watchfulness, they had imposed on themselves, were fairly captivated by his bold sallies of wit, and the irresistable drollery of his manner. Captain Hendee, with his war-stories, was completely thrown into the shade by the extraordinary convivial powers of the stranger, who, having now fairly become the hero of the company, continued to pour forth, from his seemingly inexaustible resources, sally upon sally, with increasing brilliancy, and anecdote upon anecdote, each of which was more ludicrous or striking than the preceding one, till the whole party became convulsed with merriment, and the house shook with the din of laughter. And not satisfied with the success that had so well crowned his efforts, in this respect, he called on Captain Hendee to bring on glasses, and a gallon of spirits at his expense, declaring that `of all God's cattle, he preferred soldiers for companions. It was not every day that a hunter, whose next door neighbors and common acquaintances were bears and wolves, and whose sweet-hearts and select friends were wolverines and catamounts, had the rare luck to fall into such glorious company. He could well afford to treat, and he should hold it a privilege to have a bout with his military friends, helping them, while he could, to drink health to the King, confusion to all enemies, and shame to the devil.' Leaving this bold, sagacious and singularly gifted outlaw and his companions to the merriment he had infused into them, and the boisterous and drunken revelry that followed, we will now repair to the other room, where a far different, though no less interesting scene was in progress. When Miss Hendee, on recognizing the voice of Darrow among those of others about to enter the house, so abruptly invited Warrington to take a seat with her in the other room, she did so from a sudden impulse, arising out of her secret dread of encountering one whose recent conduct had filled her with the deepest dislike, coupled with a sort of vague apprehension, that the visits of these soldiers with Darrow at their head, at this particular time, was in some way to affect the safety of her friend, whom she thought thus to shield from the impending danger. And it was not till they become seated in the room by themselves, that it occurred to her, that she had voluntarily affored her lover the very opportunity which, at their recent interview, he had earnestly requested, but which she had so promptly and pointedly refused him. Blushing deeply at the thought of her apparent inconsistency, and fearful that this act would be misconstrued by the other, she suddenly commenced uttering an apology, or explantion, but perceiving some worse dilemma from so doing, she stopped short in the midst of a sentence, blushing more deeply than a first, while an embarrassing silence ensued, which neither party, for some moments, was able to break. Warrington, however, comprehending the cause of her embarrassment at a glance, and anxious to relieve it, soon rallied and observed, `Fear not, Miss Hendee, that I shall misinterpet this act of yours in inviting me to a seat with you here: I believe I can appreciate the motives that led to it; and I certainly feel very grateful for the deed.' `You were ever generous, Mr. Howard,' replied Alma, with a grateful smile, `but do you comprehend all the motives that might have influenced me in this?' `I may not all, but will Miss Hendee state wherein she supposes I may not understand them?' `Did you recognize any of the voices of these last visitors, while they were at the door, or have you since?' `I can scarcely say I have, though I conclude them to be soldiers from yonder garrison.' `They are—all that will appear, at least, I presume, and among them is that suspicious fellow, from whose intrusion you so kindly relieved me the other day. He went away at that time, I think, harboring revengeful feelings towards you, and does not this visit involve some design against your safety?—Though I confess I can hardly see how you should be sought here with any purpose of revenge.' `You may be right, Miss Hendee,' said the other, thoughtfully, after a silence of a moment; `you may be right in supposing me the object of their visit. I have had some suspicions from the first that it was so; and I have noticed some indications, indeed, since we have been in this room, which go to confirm me. Yes, you may be right in this, but wrong, I think, in judging of the motives that have led to the visit.' `What other motive can there be but the one I assigned?' at length asked Alma, with an air of perplexity mingled with some uneasiness. `Miss Hendee,' resumed Warrington, with considerable embarrassment at the effort, `your question leads me to a declaration, which my painfully conflicting obligations, as a citizen, and as gentleman who has received much kindness from your family, will be some excuse, I hope, for withholding till now; but which my feelings will allow me to withhold no longer. Miss Hendee, my name is not Howard!' `Not Howard!' exclaimed Miss Hendee, with a look of unfeigned surprise. `Not Howard!' she repeated, the tall arches of her beautiful brows slightly contracting with an incipient frown. `Surely, surely, Sir!' `Nor is that, I fear you will think,' resumed the other seriouely, and now with perfect composure, `the worst of the avowal; I am aware what I risk— what, indeed, I shall probably forever lose in your esteem, fair lady. But duty to you, and respect to my own character, compels me to the disclosure—I am Charles Warrington!' A sharp, inarticulate exclamation burst from the lips of the astonished and recoiling girl, at the announcement of the name. `What is the matter there, Alma?' asked Captain Hendee, in a tone modulated somewhere between the jocose and anxious, as he thrust his head partly through the door, beside which he was sitting, on the opposite side of the partition in the other room, `what is the case there, girl?—Doctor Hunter is not pulling a tooth for you, is he?' Perceiving, however, nothing but dumb shows going on between the parties, and satisfied with the shot he had given them, he left them to another embarrassing silence, which for many minutes was broken by neither. `I am so surprised at this strange and unexpected developement, 'at length observed Miss Hendee, though with mind and feelings still unsettled and balancing between the former high opinion she had entertained of her companion as Howard, and the preconceived picture of the ruffian-like character with which she had been accustomed to associate Warrington: `so surprised that I hardly know what I should say, or how I should act towards you, Sir, in the new character in which you now stand before me. Am I to understand that our quiet home here is now to be made the theatre of contention in a dispute for a possession?' `Heaven forbid!' replied Warrington, eagerly, `You have, Miss Hendee, my pledge already in this respect, given to you at our last interview—can you doubt my will to redeem it? And you now perceive with what authority I could make the assurance. But though you can have no apprehensions of this kind of me, or my people, for whom I can safely answer, yet what will be your opinion of one who made, and has since sought your acquaintance under a disguised name? It is that which troubles me, dear lady. And in that you have an apparent right, at least, to condemn me, though not acting for myself, but for those who assigned me the part in which disguise was deemed necessary.' `You need not forestall your sentence, Sir,' said the other, something very like a smile again lighting up her sweetly expressive countenance, `I know too little of the merits of this unhappy controversy, I freely confess, to feel sure of doing justice to either party in any opinion I might now express. I believe I can still put trust in you—at least, I will for the present believe so: For it would indeed be humiliating to us all, to find ourselves so much mistaken in one, whose character we had so highly estimated. Yes, in you,' she repeated with emphasis, `but in your party'—and she paused, but soon, and without finishing the sentence, resumed `can you inform me who is that fearful looking, and singular stranger in the other room?—or was I mistaken in judging from some appearances I noticed, that you and be were acquainted?' `Your conjectures were true. His name, however, I cannot disclose. But this I may say, that he is not all that he may have appeared here to night; and yet he is far more—a man of many high and noble qualities, combined with extraordinary powers of body and mind, though now placed here in circumstances as inauspicious as my own. These circumstances, as they will make up an answer to the question you asked before I announced my true name, I will now, with your permission, briefly explain.' His fair auditor signifying a willingness, at least, to listen to the explanation, Warrington, taking a comprehensive glance at the true grounds of the controversy between the settlers and their opponents, drew a vivid picture of the wrongs and consequent sufferings which the latter had endured, and which led to the part he had taken in their behalf—explained the necessity of the disguise he had assumed, related his subsequent career, and the consequences to himself and all those who had taken a conspicuous part in attempting to defend the poor settlers against the rapacity of their oppressors. `Is this, Mr. Howard—excuse me, Mr. Warrington, I should say,' observed the other, evidently interested, and even touched by the recital she had just heard: `is this, indeed, an impartial account of this hapless contest? And are these armed men here to drag you to prison, and an ignominious death, for acting a part like this? Why, O, why, did you venture here into the very jaws of the lion? and now, why do you a moment linger? why not escape while they are at their noisy carousals in the other room?—that door—these windows'— `Have all been guarded; each by a soldier with a loaded musket, from the moment we entered this room. An ear, practised in the forest, has not failed to catch the sound of their cautious and stealthy tread, the occasional rubbing of their muskets against their buttons, and indications of their presence and object not to be mistaken.' `Oh! I do wonder how you can be so calm. What hope—what resource is there left you, in which you can now trust for escape?' `Many! be not concerned. They probably think we shall remain through the night, and will deem it safest to defer any attempt to seize us till they suppose us asleep. I trust much in my friend, ever fruitful in expedients, and now acting a part in the other room, as nigh as I can judge from what occasionally reaches my ear, with reference to effecting this object. Neshobee is a friend; and may I not hope an acquiesence, at least, from you?' `Most certainly the latter, and if I could—but what could I do?' `Perhaps nothing—perhaps much. We must act on circumstances. But had we now not better part: I feel anxious to be co-operating with my friend,' said Warrington, rising and moving towards the door. `One moment longer—that is, if you are not too anxious to go,' observed Alma, motioning him to remain. `What would my fair friend say?' asked the other, perceiving her to hesitate. `Should you escape this danger, as I hope you may,' at length replied Alma, `I trust—I pray, that you will not be so thoughtless as to venture here again. There may be other hazards in repeating your visits here, besides the fearful one you have already incurred of being seized in behalf of the public authorities.' `Indeed! but in what way, lady?' `There may be those,' she answered with evident reluctance and with severely conflicting feelings, `who would look on your visits here with—with suspicion; and who, I fear—who, perhaps, I would say, might have a disposition—that is, he may'— `I did not understand the name,' said Warrington, with the appearance of wishing to relieve the embarrassment of the other, and assist her to proceed. `I did not name him, and I would gladly avoid doing so,' replied she, still hesitating. `But of what avail will be your caution, unless I know against whom to be on my guard?” asked he, 15 with a little spice of the lawyer in the question, he being more anxious to learn the name of his unknown rival, to whom he rightly conjectured she alluded, than concerned on account of any danger he apprehended from his jealousy or malice. `But if you kept entirely away?—unless, perhaps, you should be sought out for the crimes you have already committed,' said the girl half playfully. `I much wish you could have received this intimation from others,' she continued, after a pause; `but as you might not; and as I have ventured, perhaps unadvisedly, to give it, I know not but you have a just right to require the name. It is Sherwood—one Jacob Sherwood.' `Sherwood!' said Warrington in utter surprise, `Sherwood. That then explains several things that to me were mysteries. `Sherwood!' he repeated, muttering, and speaking as if to himself, `yes I know the man, and the heart of the man. But is it possible, with Sherwood for a rival, and Alma Hendee the object, that she for him would'— `Trespasser!' exclaimed the other, shaking her head with a look in which menance and roguishness were queerly blended, `trespasser, beware!' `Cruel! cruel! I must not then even ask if there is hope, even one ray of hope, in the future!' rejoined Warrington with the air of tender reproach. `O, how can you ask'—replied Alma, her countenance now changing to a serious, even a sad expression, `how can you ask, or expect this, when I see no hope for myself? And how can you think of entering into a discussion so useless, at such a moment as this? Go, go!' When Warrington, at the close of the interview above described, entered the room of the revelers, he found them at the height of their boisterous carousals. The health of every known potentate on the earth, and some under it, was proposed and drank, by the huge stranger, now the undisputed master of the ceremonies, who, at each rapidly succeeding toast tossed off his glass with as little apparent regard to its effect on himself, as if the beverage had been water—such, at least was there every appearance of his doing: For he always lifted a full glass to his lips, and returned it empty to the table, while he made this his boast in urging the same on his companions of the revel, all of whom, with the exception of Darrow, seemed little disposed to refuse a compliance. The latter, however, after drinking a few stinted glasses, contrived constantly to evade a repetition which would unfit him for the enterprise, that he, at least, had by no means lost sight of; while it was with increasing uneasiness, that he perceived the fearful inroads which the liquor was making on the faculties of his men. This, however, might not have alarmed the wary sergeant, had not both of his intended victims been in the same condition: Since so long as they drank as freely as the rest, the difficulty of their seizure, he knew, would be diminished in the same proportion with the powers of the men, upon whom he depended for its accomplishment. But Warrington, he soon noticed, though mingling gaily with the rest at the board, seemed inclined, like himself, to drink but lightly, making the excuse, when urged to take more, that he wished to keep sober in order to take care of his brother hunter, who seemed in a fair way to require his assistance. And the appearance of the stranger, indeed, soon well confirmed the truth of the observation. His wit fast grew vapid; and some of his remarks were so silly, that none but the very drunkest of the soldiers would join him in the maudlin roar of laughter, which he raised at each of his efforts to be witty. He began to sway to and fro, and his huge frame to totter at every step, like a sapped tower about to fall to the earth,—all of which was observed by Darrow with a look of malicious satisfaction. Warrington now proposed that the company should break up, and all retire for the night. This proposal was seconded, though from far different motives, both by the Captain and Darrow. A question, however, now arose in regard to the accommodations which could be furnished for sleeping; the Captain stated that he had but two spare beds, which might be made to answer for four of the company. He should have been extremely happy to be able to accommodate all his guests with beds; but as it was, they must agree among themselves, who should occupy those he could furnish. The sergeant immediately proposed, that Warrington and his drunken friend should take one of the beds, and himself, and one of his men, would occupy the other, while the rest should seek lodgings in the barn. At this moment the drunken outlaw, roused from the stupor, into which he seemed to have fallen during the discussion, so far as to appear conscious of the point of debate, and hiccuping at every word, swore with a big oath, that his military friends should have the best—they should have both the beds, or he would fight them like h—l. And that other scurvy hunter, who was not man enough to drink like a gentleman, should go to the barn with him, and sleep on the hay, or he would fight him too, and be d—d to him.' To this, Darrow, for some reasons of his own, strenuously objected; and the debate was growing warm, when Miss Hendee entered the room, and after asking the cause of their dispute, and looking a moment with an air of disgust at the now helpless stranger, earnestly begged of her father to let the creature have his way, and by no means suffer him to occupy a bed in the house. `I think, Captain Hendee,' remarked Warrington, now for the first time offering an opinion, `that the man's notions, as bad off as he appears to be, are correct. He will probably keep the house in an uproar half the night, if he remains. It is more suitable, I think, that he should be taken to the barn. And it is my duty, I suppose, to attend him.' `I by no means intended to exclude you in my prohibition, Sir,' said Alma, addressing Warrington. `O, no, certainly not, I presume. But I think I ought to go with him,' rejoined Warrington. `And a bed of hay,' he added gaily,' `is far better than has sometimes fallen to my lot.' `Hoy! there, Cap—Cap—Capting!' stammered out the stranger, lifting his head, though nearly falling out of his chair at the effort, `say, you Cap—Capting Handy, Hindy—dev—divil knows what, take good care—care my rifle—cost ten pounds —king's lawful cur—cur—curren—cyation,—God d—n—bless him!' `And of mine, too, Captain, if you will. We will leave them in the house till morning, with your permission,' observed Warrington, exchanging a significant glance with Miss Hendee. Darrow, who till now had manifested a determination that our two outlaws should remain in the house with him, on hearing that the valuable rifles 15* were to be left behind, seemed no longer to entertain any suspicion of the arrangement last proposed, and conceeded the point without further objection. Captain Hendee, then ordering Neshobee to take the rifles into the next room, and pointing out the beds to be occupied by Darrow and his men, took leave of his guests for the night, and with his daughter retired to the other part of the house. Every thing being now settled to the apparent satisfaction of all parties, it only remained to get the helpless and unwieldy outlaw to his lodgings in the barn. And Darrow and his men all declaring that they would by no means consent to quit their generous entertainer till they had seem him safely disposed of for the night, Warrington and the soberest soldiers to be found in the company, now assisted him in getting on his feet, and bracing out his legs so that he could be kept from dropping on the floor. When this, with considerable difficulty, and no little noise and merriment, had been effected, they planted themselves firmly under each arm, and at the word of command, sportively given by one of the company, trundled, or rather pushed his huge and staggering carcase, forward toward the barn, attended by the whole company, reeling, jostling and shouting along by his side. After they had arrived there, and succeeded in getting their charge over the threshold, they unceremoniously tumbled him on a pile of hay on the barn floor; when, after exchanging mock ceremonies of parting politeness, Darrow and all his men, now feeling sure of an easy and safe capture as soon as their intended victims were asleep, departed for the house. `Charles!' said the big outlaw, raising himself on his elbow, as soon as the sounds of the receeding footsteps of the soldiers had died away, `Charles!' he repeated, in a low, though perfectly sober tone, `you creep carefully round to those side windows, and see if some of these curses ain't still lurking round the barn to watch us.' The other, silently complying, soon returned, and reported that no one was visible. `Well now, Charles,' resumed the first speaker, `you get down there at my feet, and see if you can pull off my plaguey old boots. There is more than a quart of rum in them. I can neither run nor fight worth a copper with my feet in such a devil's pickle.' `Upon my word, Colonel!' said Warrington, while complying with the request just made, `you would make no slouch of a juggler. I saw no chance of succeeding in any way short of drinking or openly refusing. And I was not a little puzzled to decide whether you were stark mad in taking such quantities of liquor, or whether you had some way of otherwise disposing of it, which I could not detect. Indeed, for the last half hour, I have been perfectly at a loss to know whether you were drunk or sober. How did you contrive to cheat them so cleverly?' `Buttoned up my high collared coat, so as to come up over my chin, at the onset. Then minding to stand so as to admit no side views to that hawk-eyed sergeant, or to the others, till they were too far gone to see straight, I dashed every glass down my bosom.—Not a spoonful has gone down my throat to night! so help me Peter! who never lied but three times, as I recollect. But come, we must be thinking of something else now. And the first question to be settled is, whether we shall go off without our rifles, and perhaps lose them entirely, or whether we shall hatch up some scheme to get them out of the house?' `I have strong hope, though I may be disappointed,' said the other in reply, `that we shall soon get hold of them through other agency than our own. I think we had better venture on remaining here a few moments longer to wait the result of an effort, which, I feel quite confident, will be made for this purpose.' `Aha, Charley?—been ploughing with the Captain's heifer, hey? Well, we will wait a little. Yes, yes, I see now what the sly jade was at, when she set in so plausibly to have `the loathsome creature,' carried off to the barn. And, indeed, Charles, I suspected, soon after I arrived, that you was in for it, there. But how in the name of Cupid, and Hymen, and Venus, and all that sort of heathen cattle, did you happen to pounce upon such a superb piece of housel stuff? I thought you never strayed so far down here to the land's end?' Warrington then related to his companion all the circumstances connected with his acquaintance with the diffent members of the Hendee family, his late discovery relative to his ownership of the land, and the course which he had, and still intended to pursue in that respect, without revealing, however, the uncertain and somewhat peculiar attitude in which he stood with the daughter. `Right nobly said and done!' exclaimed the other, who had listened with the appearance of much interest to the recital, and who seemed highly to appreciate the delicate generosity of Warrington, `nobly, indeed, though with a higher touch of the chivalrous, I fear, my dear fellow, than you would often find reciprocated in this wooden age and country. However, you will one of these days be rewarded, I suppose, by receiving the same lands, and an article with them that will richly pay you for your forbearance: For by all the saints, from St. Paul down to ragged St. Patrick, I swear, that if there be any angels of clay—that, though, is nonsense for a married man. But seriously, Charles, I don't know when I have seen the like of that girl! A form and face, the mould of which, I think, must have been broken with but one cast—eyes with the rich and lustrous hue of good old indigo, though pure and clear as the mudless crystal to the very depths of the soul beyond them. And then her smile, Charles —enough to craze an anchorite, by heavens!' `Really, Colonel,' rejoined Warrington jocosely, `you would make me jealous, if I had but a tithe of the title to the girl that you seem to suppose. She is engaged, man, to one Sherwood, the very fellow, as I this night ascertained from her own lips, whom we caught and beech-sealed for a spy and traitor, on our way down the creek, and to whom, doubtless, we are indebted for this concerted plan for our seizure.' `I heard of your doings with that scoundrel, as I came along a day or two after. And the only fault I find about is, that you did not string him up, according to decree of convention, in such case made and provided. But can it be possible, Charles, that God ever made this girl for such a fellow? I swear, I don't believe it! And if there is not enough of you to set him aside'— `Well, what then?' `Why, you don't deserve her, that's all—but whist! I thought I heard a footstep. See to your pistols, Charles!' `All handy, Colonel. But what is your plan if they beset us here?' `Why, fight 'em, most likely, I think,—a d—n poor story, if we two an't a match for those four half fuddled devils!' `Certainly, but there were nearly, or quite, as many more, posted round the house in ambush, or my ears deceived me sadly.' `No? were there?' `Yes, I am positive, colonel.' `Well, well, Charles, the trifling addition of three or four more of them, an't worth standing about. But hush again!' continued the speaker, his voice sinking to a whisper, `I was right: I just caught the glimpse of a head peering in at that side door.' The senses of the big outlaw had not deceived him. And the object of his suspicion now appeared several times before the partly opened door; thought at each time suddenly, and for a moment withdrawn. At length the door was cautiously opened considerably wider, and the questionable head thrust fairly in, where it remained stationary as a block for a full minute. `Umph!' at length uttered the object in a low, but distinct tone. “All right,' said Warrington, `it is Neshobee, as I expected.' `Umph! me come—got um your rifles,' said the latter, noiselessly advancing, and handing the guns to each of their respective owners. `You have done us no fool of a favor, my fine fellow,' said the elder Green Mountain Boy. `How did you get the guns out of the house?' `Missus Alma contrive um all,' replied the Indian. `She put um out her sleep-room window—then say it—so me go bring um.' `A glorious girl, that, by Jupiter!' resumed the former. `You and she both, my red friend, deserve a pension at our hands. Here, take hold of this crown piece, to begin upon.' `Him good! Cappen, him good afore,' said the native, taking the proffered coin. `And I will try to continue so,' said Warrington, thrusting another crown into the Indian's ready hand `But any thing more, Neshobee?' he continued, judging from the other's manner, that he had something further to impart. `Missus Alma say me tell um go—say the rest sogers come in house now, drink rum more again— say, go straight, quick, better—no stay minute.' `Good advice, too,' said the big outlaw, `and let us lose no time in following it. Charles, lead the way!' Cautiously emerging from the barn, and clearing the yard fence, our two friends now proceeded, with silent but rapid steps, through the open field, till they gained a knoll about sixty rods from the house, when the nameless outlaw paused, and looked back. `Clear of the rascals at last, I believe,' observed Warrington. The other made no reply, but stood as if debating some point in his mind, which he was unable to decide. `Well, which way now, Colonel?' resumed the former, thinking his companion might be hesitating about the rout they should take. `Get thee behind me, Satan!' at length exclaimed the other, violently dashing back both his hands, `Give me joy, Charles,' he added, without paying the least attention to the question that had just been asked him, `give me joy, for I have conquered.' `Indeed, sir, it is quite impossible for me to comprehend you.' `Not comprehend me! O, true, how should you? It only passed through my mind. Well, Charles, I have been sorely tempted—never so tempted in my life.' `About what, pray?' `Why, about going over and taking yonder fort to night. According to your account of the numbers now on this side, there cannot be over ten or a dozen left in the garrison. You and I could have taken their boat here, while they were waiting for us to get to sleep, slipped over and made the attempt. I think we could carry it. And ah!' continued the speaker, rubbing his hands in extacy, `there would have been glory, glory in it, Charles! But duty forbade; for a failure certainly, and success, probably, would have defeated an object of two fold importance to the country. And conscience told me I should forego my private wishes for public good. That object, as stone walls have ears, they say, I will not name here. But it was that which brought me into this section. Hendee's situation here, so near one of the enemy's strong holds, made it important that his feelings should be known. And it was for that purpose I called to night, when I unexpectedly found you. I intended to have been at a half a dozen other places before this, and I should, but for this cursed bother with these minions of hell and New York. We will now on to your encampment. I called there at sunset. Your lieutenant had returned. The party sent to seize the surveyor had just been heard from, and were expected to arrive with their prisoner to night. He must be tried and disposed of in a hurry. But have you made any further discoveries about the York justice, in this section?' `I have ascertained his residence, and discovered the bearing of his feeling towards the enemy—nothing further.' `Enough! I have received, since we parted, papers which settles the case. We must have him up, and do off all this York business in a batch in the morning; for there is much to be done to-morrow, in preparation of a general meeting of the trusty to-morrow night, in the vicinity of the Middle Falls. Ah! Charles, there is something afoot, to which this petty warfare we have been engaged in with New York, is as a rush light to the meridian sun! I burn to be in it; for it will be great, daring and glorious!' Leaving our two Green Mountain Boys to proceed to their present destination, with hearts swelling at the thought of the future, and somewhat elated withal at their fortunate escape from a danger of certainly no small magnitude, when the vicinage of the fort, and small chance for a rescue, are considered, we will return for a moment to the company we left at the house. It would be difficult to describe the rage and chagrin of Darrow, and his men, when, after waiting till they supposed their two intended victims were helpless in sleep, they proceeded stealthily, and with undoubting assurance of an easy victory, to the barn, and discovered that their birds were both flown. They saw at once that they had been fairly outwitted by the wily outlaws. Solacing themselves, however, with a promise of seizing the fugitives another day, they gave up the project for the present, well knowing that any attempt at pursuit would now be utterly useless. And at the command of Darrow, who kept his future 16 purposes, whatever they might be, to himself, they all silently withdrew from the house, and immediately crossed over to the fort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “They came not from the head, it was the heart that wrote them.” The next morning after the affair at the Lower Falls, between our Green Mountain Boys and the hired minions of Colonel Reed, a separation, as the reader will readily remember, took place among the former, the several individuals who had occupied a conspicuous place in our story, departing in different directions, and with objects as diverse as their various destinations. Some of these individuals, still designed to sustain a close connection with the events we have undertaken to delineate, have been neglected through several of our last chapters, in order to preserve, as unbroken as possible, the chain of the leading part of the narrative, in several scenes we had commenced so nearly connected as to render a break alike disagreeable to both reader and writer. But being allowed a short respite before following those, with whom we have just parted, we now hasten to bestow, in the first place, some attention on our friend Selden and his new charge, the volatile, but not ungifted, Jessy Reed, by following them to the destination, for which they were on the point of embarking when we left them. This was at Skenesboro', near the south end of the lake, so called from the name of the proprietor of a large body of land at this place,—Colonel Skeen, who, being not only a wealthy land holder, but the commander of one of the king's regiments, had here constructed a large, strong stone house, and made it a sort of military post, as well as the residence of his family and various dependents. The whole of this curious establishment, not a little resembling that of one of the ancient feudal lords, was at this time, under the command of Major Skene, a son of the proprietor, the father having been some months absent, engaged in negociations for his own aggrandizement at the British court. It was to this place that Miss Reed had so fearlessly undertaken a voyage in an open skiff, with one oarsman and Selden, her volunteer knight attendant. But a description of this voyage, together with many circumstances which preceded it, we will now, agreeably to a previous intimation, allow the fair voyager to give in her own language. And for this purpose we present the following letter, sent by her a few days after her arrival at Skenesboro', and received on the morning following the events recorded in the last chapter:— To Miss Alma Hendee,— `I have most serious doubts, my dear Alma, whether I am exactly myself. And should you be equally dubious, as I expect you will, when you have perused all that I shall now, under the rose, impart, you may set it down, if you please, as the relation of a pretty dream, which has passed through the brain of Philip Skene's half courted high-flyer, while dozing under the soporific thoughts of a matter of course, all very suitable sort of a match, with his grave and calculating majorship. One thing, however, I imagine, is certain; and that is, that I am here at Skenesboro', snugly immured in the Major's stone castle. And why I am so positive of this is, that I feel so sleepy, and have felt so ever since he left us. He! who? Ah! that sets me afloat again! But I will begin at the beginning; and dream or no dream, you shall have the whole of my adventures with (now be making up your mouth for interjections!) those horrid, brave, dear ugly Green Mountain Boys. Accompanying my father from Montreal, with my half Indian girl, Zilpah Wampum, under the arrangement that we should be left, and stationed at Skenesboro' during his contemplated sojourn of some time in the city of New York, I besought him right earnestly on the way, to let me go with him to visit his possessions up Otter Creek, to which he intended to return for a day after landing us at the Major's. After a few of those not very alarming affairs, pshaws! pishes! &amp;c., I carried my point, as I generally do, with my, I fear, too indulgent parent. And what was a still greater victory, and certainly much harder to be won, I prevailed upon him at last to let us remain there for a few days after he had proceeded on his journey, under the condition that I should take a very fair, warm, and very calm day, within a week at farthest, and, with our best boat, and two of our most careful men there, proceed to our original destination. Well, there we remained at that wild, romantic place, happy as larks; by day rambling round the fields for flowers, skirting the woods for spruce gum, boxberries and birds' nests, and at night, listening to the adventures of the men, or quizzing the honest old McIntosh, the commander of the post, as he calls himself—there we remained, I say, till the fourth day after father had left us, when, who should make his appearance, but that plausible and oily tongued beau of yours, Jacob Sherwood, announcing that a band of Green Mountain Boys, headed by Warrington, the outlaw, was in full march to lay waste, burn and destroy our possessions, and murder every soul to be found on the premises, or at least to carry us off as captives to their dens in the mountains! My heart beat like a young drummer! And as for Zilpah, though mute as a fish, her complexion wonderfully improved about that time, I assure you. However, being a soldier's daughter, as well as yourself, I soon made up my mind not to die of fright, at least; so I flew round, helped the men to make cartridges, and whatever else I could do, in preparation for the expected visit. Sherwood was invited to aid in putting the garrison in a state of defence, and remain with us through the coming siege. But O, no! he couldn't possibly! He must be off to the woods to watch the enemy's approach, and give us signal guns when they arrived at the clearing. Well, after the whole establishment had resounded with the din of preparation about an hour, and every thing was prepared for their reception, M'Intosh called us together, women and all, for a council of war, to hear the different plans that might be offered as to the best mode of conducting the defence, though doggedly determined, all the while, that none but his own should be adopted. And what think you that was? Why, that all the men should take the field against the enemy, and fight their way back, under cover of log-heaps, to the works, leaving us, poor women, entirely alone, to unbar the 16* gate to receive them when they should reach it and give the watch-word. This sage plan of operations, as you may well suppose, did not at all strike my fancy. But finding opposition useless, I submitted with the best grace I could, demanding, however, as the terms of my compliance, that they should leave me a good musket, (a Major's wife at one of our stations, some years ago, having taught me how to load and fire one,) for our defence, in case I should have occasion to use it. This settled, McIntosh marshalled his men, sallied out and lay in ambush till the enemy appeared, when a battle commenced, in which powder enough was burnt to have slain a regiment, though, strange to tell, not one drop of blood was spilled on either side. Now comes my part of this queer drama. While I stood at the gate listening, with palpitating heart, to the thunders of the musketry in the field, and anxiously awaiting the signal to open to our men, I heard steps outside the enclosure, which I knew could not proceed from any of our party. Almost desperate with fear, I seized the loaded gun which had been left for me, and stood on the defensive, while poor Zilpah, still worse frightened, fled into the house. All for a few moments was quiet, when happening to look round, I beheld, to my utter surprise and consternation, one of the enemy approaching me, three of them, it seems, having already scaled the walls behind the house. Heaven forgive me! in the desperation of the moment I fired my gun at him, though thanks to the same Heaven, without hitting him. He proved to be the Lieutenant of Warrington, who now, with the other man, rushed forward from behind the house, when all stood confronting me. But what do you think they did? Seize me like ruffians, as from Sherwood's tale of the horribles, I expected? No, they came forward, and, in the most mild, and gentlemanly manner, advised, nay, entreated me to retire into the house, to which I now suffered myself to be conducted by Lieutenant Selden, who had just providentially escaped death by my hand! I think I must have appeared like a fool. I certainly felt like one. I need not inform you that our men now soon surrendered to the Green Mountain Boys, who took possession, claiming, however, none of the moveables, and asking only that the men should leave the place the next day. The treatment I received, and the explanations given me by Warrington (who by the way is a noble looking fellow; Alma, I wish you could see him,) in regard to this war about titles, soon overset all my preconceived opinions of the Green Mountain Boys. Indeed, if we can rely on their statements, I hardly know how our people can be justified in driving these poor settlers from their farms. But what shall I say of him—Mr. Selden, I mean? Who would credit it,—I would not a week ago, I am sure—that, after having called him a ruffian and monster to his face, as I did when he first approached me, I was found in the twilight of the same evening, rambling, arm in arm, with the handsome, quizzical, audacious rogue, along the freshly flowered banks of the Otter, quoting poetry with him, or listening to the better poetry of his own brilliant conceptions, which sometimes flowed from his lips in bursts of surpassing eloquence, and sometimes in sallies of wit, so original and irresistibly humorous, that I would defy the gravest puritan in the land to keep his risibles from breaking loose on the occasion. He volunteered to attend me to Skenesboro', the next day, and I—now don't suspect me of being captivated with the fellow, Alma—I accepted his offer—how could I do less? Well, the next morning, with Zilpah, bag and baggage—the bag, you will say, perhaps, should have been given to him— and with one of father's trusty and strong armed Highlanders for an oarsman, we shipped aboard boat, and proceeded down the creek. The day was most serenely fair. And our voyage to the mouth of the stream, as we glided along with the gently flowing current in its meandering course, was indeed delightful. The forest-lined banks were beautifully frosted with the white wood violet, or blushing with beds of wild tulips; while the budding branches of the over-hanging trees above seemed fairly vivified by the thousand melodious duets that were joyously bursting from the happy little hearts of these minstrel lovers of the grove. After we had reached the open lake, we found a pretty breeze blowing freshly from the westward. And the gentleman, fixing up a blanket for a sail, our little craft swept through the lake right merrily, I assure you. We were soon abreast of your charming situation. And I could hardly consent to pass you without hauling up for a short morning call; but the men urging that by improving the breeze we could easily reach our destination by night, when otherwise we might fail of so doing, I reluctantly agreed to forego the pleasure of seeing you, and introducing my Green Mountain Phœnix—not that I am particularly charmed with him myself, but I think you would have been gratified in beholding so rare an avis, as a gentleman, as he really is, from so wild and savage a region as this Green Mountain country. At noon we dined quite romantically from off the middle seat of our boat, on edibles furnished from our store-basket, and neatly arranged by Zilpah. I never partook with greater zest; and what with the keenness of our appetites, the novelty of the affair, and the thousand spicy things said on the occasion, I don't believe I should have enjoyed the banquet of a princess with half the pleasure that I did this meal. After we had taken our refreshment and again got under weigh, for we had run into a little cove beautifully over arched by a cluster of whispering pines, the saucy rogue so managed as to get Zilpah and the oarsman into one part of the boat, and himself and your humble servant into the other, with our blanket sail forming an impenetrable screen between. Here, after sentimentalizing, and poetizing awhile over the ever changing views of scenery, alternating with the majestic and beautiful, as we rapidly glided by them, he began a set of compliments so very pointed, and squinting loveward, but at the same time so oddly framed, that I knew not whether to laugh or be angry. I should have severely chided so much boldness in a stranger, however, on one or two occasions, had not the provoking creature, carefully watching my countenance, thrown in some remark that gave an entire different turn to the whole meaning of what he had begun to say. So you see, Alma, how far I am from any thing like the tender passion in this strangely begun,and no less strangely maintained acquaintance. The remainder of our voyage was now mostly occupied by him in giving me a history of his life as far as he knew it himself, relating the singular and certainly very romantic adventures through which he passed, from his childhood to the present hour. Having neither time nor space to detail them now, I will only say briefly, that he was horn somewhere in New England, as he supposes; for he neither knows his birth place, nor the name of his parents. But by some means or other falling into mercenary hands when a mere child, he was sold as a slave,—passed through several hands, and at length carried over the waters,—taken into the protection of a philanthropie nobleman in England, by whom he was liberally educated and furnished with a handsome outfit to purchase a commission in the army, or seek his fortune wherever he could find it. He then after wandering awhile in Europe, obeyed the impulse of his own heart, and came to visit his own country; when, being enamoured of a sylvan life, and thinking he should enjoy the excitements usually to be found in a border settlement, he soon found his way to the New Hampshire Grants, and enlisted in the controversy, which he here found going on between the settlers and the New Yorkers. By the time he had closed this very interesting, and delightfully told autobiography, we hove in sight of the castellated establishment of the Skenes'. It was then, almost for the first time, that it occurred to me, that, attended as I was, my meeting with the family must be an extremely awkward one, since the feelings of the major, as well as those of his father, the colonel, are known to be hostile to the Green Mountain boys, and I could not forbear hinting this to Selden, and suggesting, at the same time, the expediency of withholding from the family, till he had gone, all knowledge of the late affair at the Falls, or his passing incog, among them. `O, no,' was his prompt reply, `mince no matters on my account, fair lady. Having made my peace with her who is most interested, and obtained an absolution for my offences—have I not? at least,' he continued with a tone and smile so sweet, so tender and yet so imploring, that I found my head nodding an assent before I knew it, `at least, may I not be permitted to hope I shall, my dear Miss Reed —having done this, they must be singularly disposed indeed to espouse the quarrels of others if they offer me any personal disrespect. No, no, fear it not, and should you feel disposed to countenance my remaining at this place through the night, I shall gladly risk all consequences to myself from so doing.' We had now reached the landing, and in a moment the inmates of the house, who were expecting me about these days, and had conjectured who we were, all rushed out, and Marge and Mary Skene with their brother, came flying like two paper kites with a lubberly boy at their tails, down to the boat to receive us. I don't know how I made my tongue do its office in returning their salutations, for my heart certainly leaped right up plump into my mouth, and I cannot conceive how that poor little member, so shamefully belied in our sex, could have possibly found room to wag! It did, however, and I introduced Mr. Selden, by name, to them all. The girls, I thought, seemed rather pleased that I had brought them a new candidate for their toils, and so fine a looking fellow into the bargain. But the major, reckoning on the possibility, I suppose, that the other might become a candidate for the toils of somebody besides sisters, looked rather askew at my gentleman, nevertheless not knowing exactly what might be a safe conclusion on such uncertain premises, he soon brought himself to behave quite decently, and escorted us all to the house without further ado. But further trials were in store for me: For Mr. Selden, as soon as we all had got comfortably seated, to my surprise, broke the ice at once: —and, after craving their attention a moment while he relieved Miss Reed, as he said, of a task which he could readily conceive would be an unpleasant one for her to perform, very coolly related the whole transaction which led to his acquaintance with me, and the consequent responsibility that devolved on him of seeing me safe to my friends. I felt, though I can scarcely tell why I should, like a criminal while Mr. Selden was making this developement, which, I had many fears, would involve his personal safety; notwithstanding he has done nothing as yet, he tells me, that the York government consider worthy of death or bonds. All seemed much surprised at what they heard, and in the major's face—that is, as soon as he could comprehend the matter, for it takes an idea some time, you know, to get through his cranium, and no great wonder neither considering how far it has to go— in the major's face I saw evident signs of a gathering storm. But knowing, that, on a resonable calculation, Mr. S. might count on two days at least before a cloud engendering in so cold a climate would become sufficiently charged to be dangerous, I did not feel greatly alarmed, and especially so as the girls seemed disposed to laugh at the affair. And Marge, on Mr. Selden's playfully proposing to submit himself to us ladies to pass sentence for his crimes, quite smartly observed, that we would sentence him to an imprisonment of a week in their stone jug, as she termed their house, and be let out to attend us on horseback or in a boat ride each day. We now passed the remainder of the evening very pleasantly. And for the next two days we almost literally inflicted on Mr. Selden the sentence which had been so queerly imposed. We read, walked, sailed and rode, alternately; and a right merry time we had of it, I assure you—Mr. Selden in the mean time becoming a great favorite with the girls, especially with Marge, to whom, I thought, he was rather more particular than he should have been in strict politeness to the rest of us. He had an object however, I presume, in conciliating the girls by his attentions. Do you think, Alma, that Marge Skene is so very handsome as some pretend to think her? `But where was my doughty Major in the meanwhile?' you will ask. Why he was so unacountably busy with the workmen in the field just about those days, that he could not, on any account, attend us on any of our delightful excursions. And when he joined us at our meals, he was as grave as a Turk. Mr. S. however, I thought, was less alarmed than amused at his awefulness of countenance. After two days thus spent, and on the morning of the third after our arrival, Mr. S. suddenly announced to us his intention of an immediate departure. The girls were evidently touched with regret and disappointment at this unexpected announcement, thinking, perhaps, that their work was but half complete. But if ever Margery, or Mary Skene, is selected by him for a cynosure I have mistaken his taste; and yet, I confess, his conduct has sometimes not a little puzzled me. He thanked me for the consideration I had shown him under unpleasant circumstances 16 of our first acquaintance in a manner so handsome and feeling, that it made me feel like a condemned and guilty one, when I thought of that mad act of mine, which marked the introduction to which he alluded. He then very politely thanked the girls for their kindness and hospitality, and was about to depart, when Marge found tongue to invite him to renew his visit. `I know not,' he answered, somewhat pensively, `that circumstances will ever permit me that pleasure in person, but if you know of any way, fair ladies.' —he continued glancing quite meaningly at somebody, as the girls in their jokes would afterwards have it—`any way of receiving the visits I may pay you in dreams, I doubt not that you will often be favored with the repetition you have so kindly invited.—Adieu, ladies, adieu.' I do not certainly know the reason of Mr. Selden's abrupt departure, but from what I can gather, I suspect the major had that morning despatched an express to the authorities at Albany, with a view to get the former arrested. This I presume, he, by some means or other, got wind of, and I am glad of it, if for no other reason than that it defeated Philip's jealous meanness. He gave us all quite a lecture that night for being so familiar with one who was so much a stranger, and threw out many ill-natured remarks about Mr. S. that helped his own cause, perhaps, less than he imagined, I wish heaven had made him such a man. I must now close this long, and, I fear, very foolish letter. I dare not read it over for fear I should burn it. I shall remain here for the present—I must I suppose, till father returns. O, what will he say, when he hears what they have done with his possessions! For myself, I care little, or nothing about it. He loses only what he paid for the land— a mere trifle. As for the labor and improvements bestowed there, he has been more than twice paid, by the profits received. Besides, he is wealthy enough without this property, which, I really suspect, he cruelly took from the poor settlers, who had as good a right to it as himself—perhaps better. P. S. I said I must stay here till father's return, but should he tarry some months, I might contrive, perhaps, to come and spend a few weeks with you. If I should, as Mr. S. will be somewhere in your vicinity, probably, and may claim me as an acquaintance, you might possibly have an opportunity of being introduced to him—that is, if he knew that I was there. Now, my dear girl, I must bid you good bye, with the charge—now lift up your hand and swear—that you will neither show this, nor breathe aught of its contents to mortal ear! Remember!! Write soon—adieu. Jessy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “You shall be viceroys here, 'tis true, But we'll be viceroys over you.” “Wait not till things grow desperate, For hanging is no laughing matter.” A few miles to the southward of the encampment of the Green Mountain Boys before described, stood the tenement of a settler whose improvements were somewhat in advance of the rough beginnings of those who resided in the immediate vicinity. And the owner and occupant, having gained that point of comparative thrift from which he could look down upon his less fortunate neighbors, had lately begun to manifest an ambition to outshine them also in the civil distinctions to which he beleived himself now entitled. But his solicitude for preferment not allowing him to await the tardy honors which his fellow settlers of the New Hampshire party might be inclined to bestow, he had lately turned his longing eye to other dispensers of these coveted favors. And the prayer of his heart, being secretly made known in the right quarter, was soon answered in the shape of an offer of the office of justice of the peace from the government of New York. Though aware of the dangerous nature of such an honor to an inhabitant of the Grants, yet the temptation, which was now set before him, and which, indeed, he had indirectly sought, was altogether too great to be resisted; and, in an evil hour, he privately accepted the office, in defiance of a decree of the Convention of his countrymen, which had placed the acceptance of such an office, from such a source, by a settler, high in the calender of punishable offences. To the tenement of this aspiring dignitary we will now take the reader in anticipation of other visitors. It was the next morning after the adventure of Warrington and his friend, the stout stranger, at Captain Hendee's; and the dawning light was just beginning to appear in the dapple east. The freshly made squire was already awake, reflecting with peculiar inward satisfaction on the honors of his new station as he lay beside his loving rib in a small bed-room adjoining the kitchen. He had only the night before received his commission, and his heart was full of the pleasing subject. He not only dwelt on the present consequence which the office would confer, but his expanding thoughts began to stretch forward to the future; and he counted over the probabilities of his advancing, on a stepping stone like this, to much higher distinctions under a government, which, he was now ready to believe—nay, secretly to wish —would soon exercise the entire control in the settlement. `They will call me squire now,' he soliloquized half aloud, `and once squire, always squire: so I shall get the title, let what will come of it.' `Come of what, Mr. Prouty?' asked his help meet with a yawn, awakening just in time to catch the last part of the sentence. `Why! why, I thought you was asleep, Polly.— Come of what, did you say? O, nothing in particular; only I have been thinking over things a little. And I'll tell you what it is;—there will shortly be a great overturn in this settlement. There will, you may depend on't.' 17* `What, the Yorkers get the upper hand?' `Sartain as you live, Polly!' `Then where will go the title to our farm? That was what you was talking to yourself about, wa'nt it, now?' `No it wa'nt. And that an't a thing, neither, that troubles me a might:' `Why not?' `Because the office I have just got under the York government I consider amounts to a security against that. And if the Green Mountain Boys will let me alone—but I don't intend they shall know about my office yet awhile.' `Yes, but what good will it do you to be a justice, if you can't be squire?' `Why, what does the woman mean?' `I mean if you darsent let folks know, so as to call you squire.' `O, I can do some business, even now, among the York party, without much danger. And it won't be long before all that trouble will be over: For, as I told you, there is about to be a complete overturn here. The Yorkers are preparing to come on with a strong, armed force. Now don't say any thing to the neighbors about this, Polly, as I had it in confidence from Mr. Sherwood.' `O, did you? Well that Mr. Sherwood is a complete gentleman—how perlite he is! Don't you think so, Mr. Prouty?' `Yes, perlite enough, forzino. Well, as I was going to say, if they come on, Ethan Allen, Warrington and Member Baker, with all they can raise, will stand no fag at all with a regular York army. And all who stand out then will be indicted and informationed against. There will be plenty of warrants called for about those days, you may depend on't. And I, being the only government justice in this part of the Grants, shall have the making of them. It will be money in my pocket, I tell you, Polly! And then, when'— `Well I hope you will then feel like getting me a new silk gownd. You know, Mr. Prouty, that my white dimoty is now the only dress that I have fit to see company in.' `O fudge!' `I say there is no fudge about it, now! The neighbors call us rich, and still it is a solemn fact, Mr. Prouty, and I don't care who knows it, that you dress your wife a great deal worse than'— `Well, well, don't bother me now; but hear what I was coming at: When the York government gets well established here, as it will be, they will want two or three judges in this quarter, I guess. And I, being the only one in all this section that had courage to accept the office of justice of peace, should n't you think, Polly, they would kind o' naturally hit on me for one of them?' `Why, bless me! will they? So they will, wont they? And then, certainly, Mr. Prouty'— `Hush! hush! I hear some body coming up to the door. Who on earth can they be, I wonder, that's started out so early?' A smart rapping being now heard at the door, Justice Prouty leaped from his bed, seized his—inexpressibles, modern dandyism would term them, we suppose, but finding no authority for believing our fathers made use of any garment, the appropriate appellation of which they considered it indecent to express, we will venture to call things by their right names—seized his breeches, hurried them on, together with the other parts of his outward equipment, and emerged into the kitchen, after having twice gone back, at his wife's hasty and imperious call, to close, and more tightly close, the door behind him. After the customary `walk in,' distinctly pronounced by the squire, the door was opened, and two men entered, both unknown to the former, though not so to those, who have followed us through all the different scenes of the preceding pages: for, in the striking attitude of one of the visitants, which compelled the civility of bowing, nolens volens, as he entered the door, like a boy coming into a country school, and in the comical leer of his countenance, as with one eye he seemed to be measuring the affectedly dignified person of his host, while the other was busily employed in taking an inventory of the various articles about the room, the reader will find no difficulty in recognizing our jovial friend, Pete Jones. The other, whose dress, and gentlemanly bearing, formed a striking contrast with that of his rustic companion, was no other than Selden, who, as before intimated, having arrived the previous evening, had volunteered with the former to make this early call on the justice to procure his immediate attendance at their encampment in the woods. `Be seated, gentlemen, pray be seated,' said the squire, bustling about, and setting chairs for his guests with one hand, and finishing the buttoning up of his vest with the other, `make yourselves comfortable—no ceremony here—just turned out, you see. Called on business, I take it, gentlemen?' he added, meaning official business, on which his mind was still running, and `the wish,' in this case, as often happens, `proving father to the thought.' `We have, Sir,' answered Selden, bowing with well assumed respect. `You are a justice of the peace we are told?' `Why, as to that, Sir,' replied Prouty hesitating, and glancing, with a doubtful air, alternately at Selden and his companion, `perhaps I may have heard —that is, I can't sartainly say but I have heard, that I was appointed to the office; though as to accepting —You are of the right party, I trust, gentlemen?' `We certainly think we are, at least, sir,' rejoined the former gravely. `That's as true as preaching, squire,' said Pete; `for if we ain't on the right side, I would give my old jack-knife to know who are.' `All right, I presume, gentlemen; but rather ticklish times, you know—thought it no hurt to be a little particular. But what business did you want done? No harm in asking that, I spose, gentlemen?' said the squire, adding the last question by way of opening a door for a retreat, should one be necessary. `O, no,' replied Selden, `but I know not that I can state precisely the nature of the business which those, who sent us for you, wish done, but it is something, I believe, that they think requires your presence.' `O, ho, not to be done here, then, gentlemen?' observed the squire, a little doubtingly, again. `No, sir, the place is several miles from here, I should think,' responded Selden with an air of indifference. `Is Mr. Sherwood there?' asked the squire rather anxiously. `I believe not, squire,' answered Selden, with the same indifference, `but they are anxious he should be, and hope he will come before closing the business.' `I'll swear to that, squire,' said Jones, with a ludicrous effort to keep mischief from showing itself in his countenance. `Aye, all right, then, gentlemen,' rejoined the squire, still stupidly determined to understand the indefinite and evasive language of his visitors, in the way that his wishes pointed. `But I thought I would make sure. You, sir,' he continued, addressing Selden, `I thought from the first glance, must belong to the right party. This other gentleman, here, I didn't know so well about, but it makes no difference what I thought, as I see you agree. I will attend you, gentlemen. But hadn't we better stop and get some breakfast first?' `O no,' replied Selden, `they expressly told us to come on immediately, and the folks would have a good breakfast prepared for us all, by the time we could arrive there.' Esquire Prouty, after notifying his wife of his intended absence, now signified his readines to depart; when all three set forward towards the encampment of the Green Mountain Boys, the former without further question, or any apparent distrust, putting himself under the guidance of his attendants. And wrapt up in self consequence, and dreaming only of the important figure he was shortly to make in the first exercise of his new vocation, he unhesitatingly followed his guides, as with rapid steps they silently led the way, sometimes proceeding in the road, sometimes through a piece of woods, and sometimes through open fields. At length they reached the border of the dark, continuous forest, within which, at the distance of about a half mile, was the encampment to which they were destined; when the squire, now for the first time hesitating, or seeming to entertain any suspicion that they were taking him to a less agreeable destination than he had anticipated, paused in his steps, and threw a doubtful and apprehensive glance around him. `Never mind, squire,' cried Jones, who, having with difficulty restrained himself from giving vent, in some shape or other, to the secret merriment he had been indulging on the way at the squire's credulity in suffering himself to be so foolishly lured from home, thought it would now do to begin to banter the obtuse justice a little, `never mind, squire! You needn't look so streaked—we belong to the right party, you know.' `Yes, but if you would but jest inform me, gentlemen'—said the other imploringly, and with visible purturbation—`only jest inform me'— `O push ahead man!' interrupted Jones, who purposely dropping in the rear, now urged on the reluctant squire with a show of pettish impatience, as if detained by excuses too frivolous to merit a reply, `push ahead!' My stomach is getting fairly wolfish for that breakfast. I'll be blest, if I don't almost think I begin to smell it at this distance!' Somewhat assured by the other's manner of treating his scruples, and, though not quite satisfied, yet feeling a little ashamed of his fears, the squire now passively suffered himself to be conducted forward till, reaching the foot of the mountain, and turning closely round a projecting ledge of rocks, he suddenly, and to his utter dismay, found himself in the midst of a group of sturdy men, whom from their appearance, he at once knew to be a band of Green Mountain Boys. Instantly comprehending the nature of their business with him, he stopped short, and stood confused, and trembling in mute alarm before them. Nor were his fears at all diminished by the array of well known names, which his conductor the next moment announced by way of introduction, the ceremonies of which the latter now commenced performing very formally with these nearest at hand. `Esquire Prouty, allow to present you to Captain Remember Baker,' began Selden, pompously waving his hand towards a keen-eyed, determined looking man, who stood in front of the others. The confused squire nodded his head mechanically, but his tongue refused to do its office, except by a half articulated `How'd do, sir,' as he heard the name of one of that famous trio, who had so long been the terror of the New York authorities. `Again, Esquire Prouty, will you permit the pleasure of presenting you to Captain Charles Warrington,' proceeded Selden, as the latter advanced to favor the introduction. `Warrington!' gasped the squire with increasing trepidation, `Warrington too'! `And yet once more,' continued the imperturbable lieutenant, beckoning to our Herculean hero of the shag coat, who figured so conspicuously at Captain Hendee's in his adventure with the soldiers the night previous, and who was now here and came forward at the intimation, `once more, Esquire Prouty, shall I have the very great honor of introducing to Colonel Ethan Allen?' `God have mercy on me!' involuntarily burst from the lips of the affrighted justice, as the announcement of the last name capped the climax of his terror and despair, `O, God, have mercy! I am a lost man!' `Pooh! you cowardly fool!' exclaimed Allen with a look of mingled pity and contempt, `rouse up, and bear it like a man, and if you promise no more to betray your injured and bleeding country by becoming the tool of tyrants, it shall go the lighter with you. At all events, you need not fear that you will be punished to the extent of half your deserts. But come, boys, set on the breakfast. It might be hazzardous to our prisoners, the squire and surveyor here, to proceed with them, with the inward man in so ravenous a flight: for Hunger and Mercy never got near enough to each other to shake hands, since the fall of Adam. And even the awards of Justice, herself, might be of questionable rectitude, if made under the irritations of an empty stomach.' The breakfast, which consisted of a plentiful supply of roasted venison, partriges, and other small game, with such trimmings as the settlers living near, and in the secret of the encampment, had sent in, was served up on a rude kind of platform, composed of smooth white pieces cleft from the freely rifting bass-wood, and supported on cross pieces laid upon forked stakes, or crotches, as they are usually denominated in the woodman's phrase. Around this temporary table, benches of an equally rude construction were placed sufficient for the accommodation of all the company including the prisoners, now consisting of the squire, the surveyor, and his assistant, all of whom were respectfully shown places at the table. The meal was generally partaken in silence, the officers seeming to fear that too much sociability might have a tendency to unnerve them for the task on hand, and the men respectfully following the example of their superiors, with the exception of Pete Jones, who could not forbear occasionally throwing a sly joke at the chop-fallen squire. 18 `Now, gentlemen, for business,' said Allen, rising from the table the moment their meal was finished, as ominously knitting his dark heavy brows, he pulled from his pocket, and, in a loud, commanding voice, commenced reading a decree of the Convention, forbidding “Each, and all, of the inhabitants of the New Hampshire Grants, to hold, take, or accept, any office of honor or profit under the colony of New York”—and requiring “All officers, and others, acting under the Governor or legislature of that province, to suspend their functions on pain of being viewed.” He then produced a letter from a secret agent of the settlers at Albany, giving the date of Prouty's commission, and enclosing a letter from the squire himself, accepting the office in question. He also presented a copy of a notice sent some weeks previous to the surveyor, warning him to quit the Grants without delay. `And now what have ye to say,' sternly demanded Allen, turning to the prisoners as soon as he had finished reading the documents: `what have ye to say, ye minions of York, why ye should not be viewed, to the full extent and meaning of the decree, made and provided for the like of ye?' Quailing under the withering gaze of Allen, the justice could not muster courage to lift his head, or utter a single word in reply. But the surveyor, who was a man of more firmness, and bore himself quite collectedly on the occasion, attempted an argument with the leader of the Green Mountain Boys, denying all right of the settlers to arrest him, protesting against being tried by any but a court acting under the authority of New York, and appealing to that authority for his justification. `The authority of New York!' scornfully exclaimed the other, `appeal to the authority of New York! Why not appeal, at once, to the chancery of hell, the fountain head of that stream of corruption, which comes to us under the name of New York law and justice? We, sir, we, the poor, and insufferably abused settlers of these Grants, have often appealed to that source of justice—appealed for protection against the lawless aggressions of your cormorant speculators, who have attempted to wrest from us our rightful possessions, to seize, with the grasp of plunderers, our hard earned pittances, and turn us out houseless and destitute into the wilderness. But we have appealed in vain, and only to learn our own folly in expecting that sin would ever be rebuked by Satan. No, sir, we will suffer no such appeal, but will ourselves give you a conclusive judgment in the premises; and such an one, too, as shall give you the wages of your iniquities. What say you, my merry mountaineers?' As soon as the hearty, but variously expressed responses, by which the men testified their approbation of the remarks of their leader, were over, Baker, Warrington and Selden, who, during the discussion, had been engaged in a low conversation apart from the rest, beckoned Allen to approach them. The latter, obeying the intimation, advanced, and, after listening attentively awhile to some proposal or plan, which the others appeared to be imparting to him, snapped his fingers with delight, and exclaimed, `Capital! Capital, by Jupiter!' he repeated, bringing down his huge palm upon the snugly fitting buckskin, covering his broad thigh, with a slap that echoed through the woods like the report of a pistol. `'Member, you shall announce it to them, and I will see that it is carried into execution.' Baker, accordingly stepping forward and addressing the surveyor, gravely informed him, that it had been determined to accede to the wish he had expressed of being tried, if he was to be tried at all, by a court of his own colony. And that Justice Prouty, who had lately been commissioned by the government of New York, would therefore now immediately proceed with the trial. `O gentlemen, O sir!' began Prouty beseechingly, as Allen now came forward to attend to the part he had proposed to assume in the business. `Now don't, Justice Prouty,' interrupted Selden with provoking irony, `don't, I beg of you, suffer your diffidence to deprive us of the aid of your acknowledged abilities in this important case. Having had the honor of introducing you to this company, I am very anxious that you should acquit yourself creditably on the occasion.' `Yes, sir, but then my situation'—again began to expostulate the troubled justice. `Come, your worship,' interrupted Allen, with a spice of the comic mingled with the determined expression of his countenance, `You are to try, and to sentence this York interloper, and no two ways about it, neither, I will swear to you. There!' he continued, seizing the reluctant and trembling squire, with one hand grasping the seat of his breeches, and the other his collar, and lifting and placing him on the side of the platform, with the apparent ease of one handling an infant: `There! sit on the edge of this table, for a King's Bench. You did not think to arrive to that honor so soon, did you Squire?' `Now, Squire,' said Peter Jones, with one of his mischievous looks, `May I be eternally happy, if I don't think you a considerable dabster of a prophet! Don't you see how cute it is all coming to pass what you told your old woman this morning about your getting to be a judge soon? Though I must axe your pardon, Squire, for listening under your bed-room window a little, before we rapped to come in.' `Well, is the court ready to proceed?' said Allen: `now for my opening, as the lawyers say—I am for the prosecution, recollect.' `Now I do protest,—I beseech you, sir'—once more began to stammer the confused and dreadfully perplexed Justice. `Shut up, Sir!' fiercely exclaimed Allen. `Hell and Furies! who ever heard of a court before so despotic as to refuse to hear the statements of counsel? No, no, Mr. Court, that will never do; so now hear me.' The Squire, thus awed into silence, hung his head, and sat as still as his agitation would permit, while the other produced, and again read the documents by which he had first introduced the subject; and, after briefly summing up the evidence, demanded that a sentence be imposed upon the surveyor of forty lashes of the beach rod. `I dispute the authority of your pretended Convention, and I protest against the whole of these proceedings as illegal and riotous,' exclaimed the surveyor with considerable spirit. `Well, very well, sir,' said Allen, with the utmost composure: `you have had your say, and made your defence, as you had an undoubted right to do. I am always for liberty of speech when a man has really any thing to say, and also for allowing a fair hearing in all cases, though that is more than your 18* infernal York tribunals will permit, in nine cases out of ten. But let us now attend to the decision of the court. Boys, you may as well be getting a brace of genteel beech-sealers; for I feel very confident of a decision in my favor. Now, Mr. Justice, proceed with your sentence. Forty stripes, with a green beech rod, is all I claim, recollect—quite moderate, certainly; but it is always best to loan towards the side of mercy. Proceed, sir!' `Any thing else, gentlemen,' groaned the distressed Squire, `I will do any thing else you say. But this, now, I cannot, and dare not do.' `Hark'ee, Mr. Court,' rejoined the other, placing his arms akimbo, and looking at the Justice with the air of one resolved to have no more words on the subject, `A sentence out of you, I will have, as sure as the devil delays his coming for your soul long enough for you to pronounce it. Will you proceed, sir? No answer, oh? Well, we will soon see whether Ethan Allen has got to eat his own words, or not. Jones, bring me that sarveyor's chain in the camp there.' Allen, taking out his pocket handkerchief, very deliberately made a slip noose, and adjusted it round the neck of the trembling squire. He next carefully tied the tail of this noose to one end of the chain, throwing the other end, at the same time, over the large limb of a tree, which projected directly over their heads, at the height of twelve or fifteen feet from the ground. `There, Jones, catch that end, and just straighten her out a little,' he observed, with a cool, businesslike air, `I have heard say that hanging was intended to bring about justice. Let us see if a little of it won't have that effect in the present instance.' Obeying with mischievous alacrity, Pete, now running the chain rapidly over the limb, brought it up just `taut enough,' to use a sea phrase, to make the noose sensibly felt by the Squire; upon which the latter, starting and glaring wildly around, as a slight sense of suffocation came over him, leaped upon his feet, and stood upright. This shift, however, afforded him but a momentary relief: For Jones, quickly following up the movement, straightened the chain with a jerk that brought the victim on to his toes; in which position, grappling the chain above his head with both hands, and begging, like a half whipped school boy, for mercy, he was suffered to remain a moment to give him one more opportunity of complying with the requisition which had been made upon him. `Your last chance of salvation'! exclaimed the leader in a tone that testified his growing impatience at the man's obstinacy. `You will comply in one moment more, or, by the horned Lucifer, the next shall find you dangling within a yard of yonder limb!' `Now I would, gentlemen, sartainly would, if'— again began to sputter the struggling, though yet unconquered Squire. `String him up, Jones!' cried Allen with startling energy. The next instant the body of the poor justice was spinning round on one toe, with the tip of which he was barely able to touch the platform. `Oh! I'm choking!' screeched the now really suffering wretch, `Oh! ugh! ugh! ugh! I will— will—I'll do it!' `Ease away there, Jones!' said Allen, `he has come to his senses, at last, and I think there will be no further trouble; so you may give him full play now.' After being again questioned as to the reality of his intentions to proceed with the required task, the subdued squire was let fully down, and permitted to stand at ease on the platform; when, as soon as he had recovered his breath and composure sufficiently to allow him to speak, he mumbled off the sentence, which he had run such risks to avoid pronouncing. `Now, Mr. Court,' said Allen, with a slightly roguish curl of the lip, `as you have been brought to a sense of your duty, and given the sentence which justice required of you, it is no doubt incumbent on you, sir, to see it executed. And, as all my men here stand sworn never to execute any sentence of a York magistrate, it follows, of course, that you must be the executioner yourself, in the present case: so now dismount, sir, if you please, take this rod, and, after I have un-noosed you of this marvelous prompter of justice,' he continued, taking off the noose and placing a beechen rod in the hands of the other, `you will proceed to apply it in a way that shall show the sincerity of what you have just said and done. Boys, you may now take off the surveyor's coat, and then form a ring, with a few switches in your hands, if you will, to see that justice is duly administered on the occasion. There! that will do. Well, squire, we are now ready to proceed—what! hesitating again! Jones, seize the end of that chain, there, and be ready while I replace the noose.' But Prouty, having had quite as many of such promptings as he felt willing to receive, did not wait to be noosed again, but lifting the rod, moved forward, as if ready to perform the required task without further resistance. Allen then advanced and threw another rod down at the feet of the surveyor, gravely observing— `There, Mr. Surveyor, supposing from what you have thrown out here, that you think the court have sentenced you unjustly, we have concluded that, while he is executing the sentence on you, we will give you a chance to avenge the injury. You have therefore our free and full permission to return blow for blow through the whole of it. Indeed, Sir, I should rather advise you to do it; for our boys here, who are great sticklers for fair play, may take it into their heads, perhaps, to say that it would be unjust for one Yorker to receive all the honors of the day, without imparting an equitable share to his fellow. And in case you should neglect to do what they think is about right, I know not what may happen to you. And now, Mr. Justice,' he continued, turning sternly to Prouty, `Now, Mr. Justice, be lively, and, with the fear of God and Ethan Allen before your eyes, lay on, sir!' It would be very difficult to conceive any thing more strangely ludierous than the scene that followed. The reluctant Squire, daring no longer to delay, now gave two or three faint and harmless blows across the legs of the Surveyor; when he was admonished by Allen, in a tone which experience had taught him pretty well how to interpret, to lay on more seriously. Spurred up by his fears, the Justice then began to administer the applications of his rod with about that medium degree of violence which, producing all the smart of heavier blows without the benumbing antidote of bruising, is always far more irritating, and is generally, perhaps, even more intensely painful to the victim than blows of double the severity. At all events, the Squire's applications soon produced a very visible effect on the surveyor, who, till this stage of the business, had stood eying the proceedings in dogged silence. But now leaping about, and being no longer able to stand the pain which the squire's applications began to impart, he hastily caught up the rod at his feet, and, swearing with spiteful bitterness, that he would put it on, to punish the other for suffering himself to become the tool of a mob, gave back the blows with so much interest that it soon roused in turn the ire of the Justice, who, now beginning to dance to the same tune, and from the same cause which had put his opponent in motion, fell to, and laid on in good earnest. Becoming thus mutually incensed, and the anger of each rapidly kindling at the increased pain of his adversary's applications, every blow of the one was followed by a heavier blow from the other. And, the blows falling heavier and thicker every instant, it soon grew into one of the most severe and furious flagellations ever witnessed in the settlement, and one that was amply satisfactory to our band of Green Mountain Boys, who stood by, sending forth shout after shout, and peal after peal of laughter, that fairly shook the slumbering wilderness with the deafening reverberations. And so deeply engaged had become these antagonist dignitaries in administering to each other this whimsically conceived, and queerly conducted punishment, that it was not till they had exceeded the prescribed number of stripes by nearly a dozen, that either of them thought of yielding. Prouty, however, being of a less obstinate disposition, and possessing less nerve than the other, at length gave over, and cried lustily for quarter, which, even then, so implacable had the surveyor become, was only granted him on the interposition of the Green Mountain Boys. `Well, Squire,' said Jones, the only man who seemed disposed to make any comments at the close of this curious scene, `don't you think these Yorkers most cruel bloody fellows? Ah! jest as I told you, Squire, we belong to the right party.' The business of the morning having been thus brought to a close, Justice Prouty, with an admonition to go and learn wisdom from folly, was released and sent home. The surveyor's instruments were next broken to pieces by Allen, and the fragments hurled into the bushes. The Surveyor himself, with his assistant, who had not been considered of public consequence enough to be punished, was then put in charge of Jones and Brown, who were ordered to escort them to the New York line, and there leave them. Within half an hour from the departure of the prisoners, the encampment of the Green Mountain Boys under Snake Mountain was broken up, and the place deserted, the different individuals composing the band, after a brief consultation, having been dispatched by their enterprising and impetuous leader, in various directions on secret business connected with the important events which were in train, and the new and untried scenes which were now soon to follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “Strong hands in harvest, daring feet in chase, True hearts in fight, were gathered in that place Of secret council.” If there is a town in Vermont whose first set of inhabitants deserved the appellation of high-minded and worthy, it was the early settlers of Middlebury. Distinguished, from their first pitch on the fertile banks of the Otter, for enterprise, firmness and intelligence, they were among the foremost to resist the aggressions of a government, which, unwittingly, perhaps, had lent itself to aid the unprincipled schemes of a few rapacious land speculators; while the opening scenes of our revolution found them ready to engage, with the same alacrity, and with the best of their means, in the greater work of achieving the independence of their whole country. And scarcely had the storm of war passed over, and the sunlight of peace begun to break in on their infant settlement, before they united, with a zeal as extraordinary, considering their circumstances and means, as it was commendable, in rearing, by private munificence alone, a collegiate institution, which for many succeeding years did more, probably, towards elevating the moral and literary character of Vermont, than any one cause operating within her borders. And her alumni, now many of them in eminence at the bar, and in the pulpit, and found gracing not only every station in their own favored country, from the humble school room, to the senate chamber of the nation, but nobly dispensing her light among the people of every clime upon the face of the broad earth, whither, in the fearless and enterprising spirit of their fathers, they have scattered themselves,— now to teach the arts to the boorish Russ, or besotted Turk, now to assist the enslaved Greek, or South American, in his struggles for freedom, and now to rear the standard of the Cross among the degraded pagans of the East—her grateful alumni, often, often, turn back, in fancy, to their beloved Alma mater, `To linger delighted o'er scenes recall'd there,' and admire, and bless the noble and self sacrificing spirit of Painter, Chipman, Storrs, and others of her munificent founders, who made themselves poor in pecuniary estate, that the children of their country might become rich in knowledge. With these remarks, suggested by the location of the scene about to be described, and their expression here promted by the personal interest which the writer of these unworthy pages must ever feel in that institution, in which he was taught at once his weakness and his strength, and to which he is mainly indebted for the schooling and chastening of a wild and untutored imagination, and for the formation of whatever mental character he may possess; with these remarks, we say, let us now proceed in the narration of our story. Could one of the fabled scenes drawn by the immortal Homer have been so far realized, on the 4th of May 1775, that Mars, the supposed supervisor of every military enterprise, had sat in his cloud-begirt chariot over that tract of country lying between lake Champlain and the Green mountains, to take note of whatever in his line of business might be on foot below, he might have perceived, on looking down from his lofty car, near the close of that day, 19 movements among the inhabitants of the particular section just named, so simultaneous, and yet so apparently unconcerted, that even his Godship, himself, unless previously in the secret, would have been sadly puzzled to decide in what manner to account for them. Nearly every man could have been seen leaving his home for some point not far to the south of those falls on Otter Creek, around which the flourishing village of Middlebury now stands. Though all would have seemed gradually centering to this spot, yet this would have been the only point of agreement discoverable in their movements, or apparent objects. Some carried axes on their shoulders, some hoes, or other implements of husbandry, and some had guns, with which they appeared to be amusing themselves, as they passed along, by shooting squirrels, or whatever small game might fall in their way. And, in no instance, were two men seen travelling together; and, if by chance, any two happened to come across each other, they immediately separated, one stopping till the other had passed out of sight, or both diverging into different, though parallel routes. The exact point of their concentration was at length seen to be an opening in the wilderness, on a gentle swell of land, commanding a view of the devious Otter from its western side. Near the centre of this opening stood a log house tenanted by a hardy and enterprising settler, a confidential friend of the master spirit of this clandestine gathering. A barn also of the same construction, and of dimensions ample enough to hold half a regiment within its walls, was standing some rods in the rear of the house. This huge fabric, as it finally appeared, had been selected, both on account of its size, and the cental position which it occupied in the northern part of the Grants, for the approaching meeting of the Green Mountain Boys. And as the shades of evening began to gather over the wilderness, and individual objects grew indistinct to the view, many a dark form might be discovered emerging, one by one, from every point of the surrounding woods, and stealthily taking their way in silence towards the building appointed for their rendezvous. But leaving this company to finish their noiseless gathering, we will now recur a little to note the adventures of one of our heroes on his way to the scene of action. We speak in the plural here, as we do not pretend to fix on any one of the several leading personages of our story as the particular hero of the work. But should the reader deem such an one to be essential in the performance, we leave him to make his own selection from all the characters we have introduced—a privilege to the reader, which, we trust, will prevent any question in his mind whether the author has himself selected the one for this honor who is the most worthy of the appellation: and a privilege too, that we the more freely accord, since we have often wished for the same favor ourselves, while reading works of this kind, and bored with the everlasting recurrence of `our hero,' applied, not unfrequently, to the worst drawn, and by far the most spiritless character in the book. After the separation of our band in the morning, the leaders, as before intimated, were actively engaged through a good part of the day in calling upon the settlers to sound their views and feelings in regard to the approaching struggle between the colonies and mother country, and to apprise them, if found right in sentiments, and ripe for action, as was generally the case, of the contemplated meeting, and the precautions deemed important to be observed in conducting it. Warrington, having performed the task allotted him as his share of this delicate, and some times difficult duty, set out, late in the afternoon, for the appointed rendezvous of the evening. After leaving the vicinity of the lake, to the borders of which his duties had been principally confined, he soon entered the woods, and, having decided on the course to be taken, proceeded onward with a rapid step several miles towards his destination, without pausing. But at length feeling somewhat wearied with the exertions of the day, he sat down to rest him, for a few moments, on the trunk of a fallen tree, and was dreamily running over in his mind the singular events of the few past days, when his attention was arrested by a clicking sound, resembling that which attends the cocking of a musket. While looking around him in doubt whether his senses had not deceived him, in respect to the impression they conveyed of the sound, he distinctly heard the snapping of a fire lock in a thicket at no great distance from the spot he occupied. Springing upon his feet, he brought his own rifle to his shoulder, and, stepping behind a tree, awaited in silence the result, which, he supposed, whatever the cause of the movement, would soon be disclosed. But hearing nothing further, and concluding that the sound came from some hunter, who, having gained sight of game, and snapping his piece at it, had noiselessly crept off after it in another direction, he thought but little more on the subject at this time, and soon leisurely proceeded on his way. The walk of half a mile now brought him to that dead and desolate stream, whose name, at the present day, `Lemon Fair,' has so often proved a puzzler to the stranger traversing this section of the country, and led him to ask the cause of so singular an appellation. The explanation that follows, however, reconciles the apparent incongruity in a way as simple and curious as it is generally unexpected. And the enquirer is soon enabled to trace this before unaccountable name, from `Lemon Fair,' through `Lamen Fair,' to the lamentable affair! which is said to have burst from the agonized bosom of a traveller, who once, in attempting to ford the stream, was doomed to the pain of witnessing his noble steed become inextricably mired, and, sinking deeper and deeper at every effort to clear himself, finally disappear with fearful death-struggles, in the bottomless quags of this Styx of Vermontane rivers. Warrington here paused to note the air of peculiar dreariness and gloom, which, even at this day, seems to brood over this paradise of eels and owls—the former finding their Elysium in the stagnant, muddy, and root-tangled pools of the stream, and the latter on the decayed limbs of the long colonade of dead and leafless tress lining the banks, where they sit moping and gloating over their inexaustible storehouse of countless reptiles swarming in the dark and turbid waters beneath. And while standing upon the banks of this stream, with his mind thus engrossed, he was startled by the sharp report of a rifle, bursting from a fallen tree top on a knoll at the distance of some eight or ten rods behind him; while at the same instant, a bullet, passing through his coat between his arm and body, struck and burried itself on the dry and barkless surface of a tree, standing a few yards before him. Whirling suddenly round towards the covert from which the shot 19* issued, as now plainly indicated by a light cloud of diffusing smoke, he again quickly brought his rifle to his shoulder, and stood for a few seconds straining his vision for a sight of the invisible foe. But being unable to discover any object with such certainty as would justify his returning the fire, he suddenly changed his purpose, and leaped forward with all possible speed towards the place. In one moment he stood on the spot just occupied by his dastard assailant; when he succeeded in catching a glimpse of a dark form rapidly retreating over another swell into a thick and tangled swamp. His first impulse was to recommence the pursuit; but a second thought told him that it would probably be in vain, while it uselessly exposed him to the hazard of another shot of his enemy from some concealment, which he would have time to gain unperceived. He therefore reluctantly turned and retraced his steps to the stream he had just left. From the form and motions of the assassin, although in a disguised dress, Warrington was but little at loss in identifying him with Darrow, whom he had twice met and as often frustrated in his base, or, to say the least very questionable, designs. And coupling the improbability that the fellow was acting from his own promptings in his murderous attempt, with the friendly hints of Miss Hendee, he no longer doubted that Sherwood was indeed bent on his destruction, and finding a willing instrument in Darrow, had instigated this method of accomplishing it. But abandoning all thoughts of any measures to punish, or circumvent, either the base tool, or his still more dastard employer, till his public duties should allow him more leisure, he now hastily crossed the stream, and proceeded with rapid steps towards the rendezvous of his assembling companions, which he only reached just as the last glimmerings of departing daylight were fading in the western horizon. `Charles, how is this!' exclaimed Colonel Allen, breaking away, as soon as he noticed Warrington's arrival, from a group of several of the most influential settlers in the vicinity, with whom he appeared to have been engaged in a low, confidential conversation, `how is this, that you are the last man to come on the ground? Why, I thought the devil had got you, or, what is the same thing in Dutch, that you had gone over to the British, to apprise them of our project. But, come, Sir, as I suppose we must allow you the credit of having done rather better than that, I have concluded to make you my right hand man for the evening.—So now for business.' `In that case, colonel,' replied the other, `let me suggest to you the precaution of placing a few sentinels around us, while in convention. There may be those abroad to night, who, if permitted to look in upon us here, would render our enterprise as vain as the crusades. Were it not too dark I would show you a hole in my coat, through which one of these prowlers a few miles back, by a small mistake, put a bullet, instead of through my heart as evidently intended.' `God bless you, Charles, what do you mean?' asked Allen, with surprise and emotion. `I mean as I say.' `But who could it be.' `That despicable Sergeant, instigated by Sherwood, I suspect.' `And what was you about not to return the compliment on the spot?' `He escaped me in a thicket, and I had no time to spend in the cautious pursuit which would be safe or successful—would to heaven I could have had more leisure!' `Well, by the blessing of God, Charles, within a week, we will have our heels on that nest of rattle snakes. But it is time to organize. You were right about a guard—will you attend to placing it, while I assemble the company in the barn, and see that each has the watchword?' Allen now ordered lights to be brought, and placing himself at the door of the building, he called to the company to advance and enter singly. Each man as he presented himself, and before suffered to pass in, was strictly required to give the watchword, which, as a precautionary measure to prevent any one being present whose views had not been previously ascertained, had been confidentially imparted by Allen and his associate leaders since the meeting was in agitation. The word chosen for this purpose was Carillon, an appellation by which fort Ticonderoga was designated by the French while in the possession of their government. After every man had passed this test of admittance, and thus proved himself entitled to mingle in the deliberations of the assembly, Col. Allen called the meeting to order, and, after stating that important business was in contemplation, the successful result of which might depend on the secrecy with which it was conducted, proposed a sort of oath of affirmation, binding all present by a solemn promise not to divulge the proceedings of this meeting, and its consequent measures, till the reasons, which made secrecy necessary, should cease to exist. This proposition was acceded to; the oath was taken by rising. Allen then, as the acting chairman of the assemblage, declared the meeting open for remarks on the subject which they had met to discuss. The dead silence, which was now for a few moments observed by the expectant assembly, was broked by Warrington, who, calmly rising, proceeded, after a few preliminary observations, to give a brief history of the commencement and progress of the quarrel between the colonies and mother country. He then enumerated the wrongs and aggressions which the former had suffered, while meekly and vainly petitioning for redress, and closed by a vivid picture of the recent massacre at Lexington, and with an eloquent appeal to the settlers to join the inhabitants of the sister colonies in avenging the death of their slaughtered countrymen. As he closed his harangue, which had been listend to with the most profound attention, a visible excitement ran through the assembly. And the hasty changing of positions, as they sat upon their rude plank seats, ranged in rows round a small table, on which dimly burned a solitary taper, the glistening eye, the indignant glance, the firmly compressed lip, and the silent working of the muscles of the faces of these hardy mountaineers, plainly told the speaker that he had been addressing men who neither lacked the intelligence to comprehend, nor the spirit to act, as soon as definite action was set before them. Remember Baker, one of the most shrewd, sagacious and coolly calculating man of the settlement, next arose and addressed the meeting. With a few observations, for he was not a man of many words, going to confirm the statements, and fortify the positions of Warrington, he told them, that although he doubted not in the least, that principle alone with them would be sufficient to excite them to action in the coming contest, yet their policy, as settlers engaged in a controversy with New York for their homes and property, demanded that they should take a bold and decided stand against the British: for by doing this they would at once enlist the sympathies of the other colonies in regard to their wrongs, draw upon themselves the attention and respect of Congress, to which, if backed by the considerations of a meritorious service in the common cause of the country, they could successfully appeal for protection against the aggressions of New York, and thus place themselves in an attitude in which they could not only command justice, but finally secure the privilege of becoming an independent State. `'Member is right!' exclaimed one of that class with whom this artful, and as the event afterwards proved, by no means ill-grounded argument, was calculated to operate with particular force. `Ay, ay!' responded another, `give me Member Baker for foresight! The more birds we can kill with one stone the better.' Although the argument of Baker was not probably without its effect on the minds of all, situated as the settlers were with respect to their controverted rights, and, when added to the manly appeal of Warrington to their patriotism and principles, had wrought up the assembly to a high pitch of feeling, yet Allen, conceiving that something more was needed to ripen them for action, and raise their minds, as he was desirous of doing, to a level with his own high-toned enthusiasm, now rose, and, after looking for a moment fearlessly and confidently around him, as he stood towering with his giant form, like Saul among the people, began,— `Men of the Green Mountains, In the struggle in which you have been for many years engaged, you have won among the people of these colonies a name for valor and patriotism. But have you gained this proud distinction in surmounting the difficulties of the past, to lose it now by inaction in the more important stake of the present? Have you so long, so nobly, so triumphantly, resisted arbitrary power in the shape of little tyrants near home, to submit now to the lawless dictations of great ones from abroad? Are you, who have just saved your homes and possessions from the grasp of these, now willing to yield them tamely to those?— to those whose despotic dominion would soon render them but possessions in name, to be transmitted to whom? to whom I say?—To slaves, in the person of your own children! Yes, your own children, who, if suffered to retain their inheritance at all, must retain it with a foot of a lord on their necks, and the hand of a priest in their pockets! Green Mountain Boys! could you, who have drank in liberty from the very air of your green hills, never yet contaminated by the breath of a tyrant, could you witness this, and live? And above all, can you now look idly on, and see a hireling soldiery swarming your country, enforcing the accursed requisitions of their masters at the point of the bayonet, shooting down your countrymen and brothers by scores, as if they were wild beasts, for exercising but the rights which God and nature have given them—can you look upon a scene like this, and lift no hand for your rights?—strike no blow to avenge the cold blooded murder of your countrymen at Lexington? Great God, forbid! No! no! my brave mountaineers, you were never born to be cringing slaves! Your bold hearts and sinewy arms were never made to be listless and idle at a time like this! Come, then, come on! follow me, whose heart is laboring and leaping for the work of vengeance, and whose arm is nerved and aching for the blow! Follow me, and I will lead you to deeds, which shall cover the Green Mountain Boys with imperishable glory, and make their name the watchword of liberty while a tyrant shall remain to disgrace the image of his God, or pollute the earth with his presence.' During the delivery of this brief and exciting appeal, the expectant audience at first sat in their seats as silent and motionless as a group of statues. Before the speaker had proceeded through many sentences, however, the whole company had noiselessly risen in their places, where they stood as if spell bound in their tracks, every head eagerly bent forward, and every eye, gleaming with the kindling fire within, riveted upon their idolized leader, to catch the bold and inspiriting thoughts that fell burning from his lips, now with looks of fire and scorn, and now with the intonations of thunder. And as he went on, rising in energy and power at every sentence, eyes were seen to flash brighter and brighter with indignation, tears of excited and overflowing feeling to gush over many a rough cheek, while many a clenched and brawny fist was brandished aloft, in mute response to the heart-stirring words of the speaker. And when he closed, `Ethan Allen, forever! Ethan Allen, forever!' rose in one loud, convulsed shout to heaven. All being now ripe for action, and many loudly demanding the object which might immediately require their services, Allen laid before them the project of marching at once upon the British forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, with the object of surprising and capturing these two important though now weakly garrisoned fortresses. The settlers being in general well apprised of the state of these garrisons, and entering with great zeal into the views of their leaders respecting the importance and feasibility of the proposed plan, the latter now made a call for volunteers, and immediately commenced an enrolment of names, which, when completed, was found, to the joy and surprise of Allen and his collegues, to embrace more than three fourths of the assemblage now present; while even the rest expressed an earnest wish to aid in the enterprise so far as it could be done without leaving the neighborhood of their homes, where their presence was demanded. All necessary measures preparatory to the expedition, as far as regarded the forces raised in this section of the Grants, were then discussed and settled, and a sufficient number of men were selected to guard every road by which any information of the contemplated movement could be conveyed to the enemy. These were ordered to enter upon their duties the next day; while the main body were to equip, and otherwise prepare themselves in the best manner the circumstances would admit, and assemble at Castleton on the fourth day from the present time. After these arrangements were completed, Allen ordered his horse to be brought to the door, and announced his intention of departing that night for the south part of the settlement, to superintend the 20 mustering of the forces enlisting, or enlisted, in that quarter. `Well, my brave boys,' said the Colonel, mounting his horse, while his devoted followers were crowding around him, `remember to meet me at Castleton on the 8th. Captain Warrington and Lieutenant Selden will muster and take charge of you. Captain Baker goes to Winooski river to raise what force he can there, and come in boats to join us on the lake. As to myself, before to-morrow's sunset I must be at Holy Hill.[3] [3] An appellation by which Ethan Allen was in the habit of calling Bennington And now, my fine fellows, go home, and prepare yourselves, without letting your left hands know what your right are doing, and may the Lord bless you all till I see you again.' So saying, and putting spurs to his horse, he dashed down the road to the south and disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. “Now be thou strong! Oh! knew we not Our path must lead to this? A shadow and a trembling still Were mingled with our bliss!” The following epistle from Miss Hendee to Miss Reed, in answer to the one from the latter, inserted in a previous chapter, was written in the interval between the meeting of the Green Mountain Boys last described, and the general mustering of their forces for their contemplated enterprise. `Forgive me, dear Jessy, but really I could not help laughing, on the receipt and perusal of your vivacious, and very interesting letter, to see the desperate attempts you there repeatedly make to conceal from me, and yourself, by naked, unasked assertions, and inferences without premises, the heart-hidden secret which your every third sentence, at least, most palpably discloses. Yes, my lady, whether you believe it or not, yourself, you are but little better than a gone girl, and your doughty major will find it out, too, as sure as Jealousy has eyes, and Love none. But never mind it, my dear girl, nor turn up that pretty, slender nose in a miff at what I say, since the same letter that gives you cause of displeasure, if cause there be, will furnish you also with the means of an ample revenge: for I, too, have adventures to relate, of the past week's occurrence, scarcely less extraordinary than your own. When you said, Jessy, in that little parenthesis which you threw into your letter concerning Warrington, `A noble looking fellow, I wish you could see him,' you little thought that your wish had been granted ere expressed; and far less did yor dream, when you added, `I think you would like him,' how much of a prophetess you was likely to become: for Charles Warrington I have seen, Warrington the Green Mountain Boy, Warrington the York outlaw, and Warrington the generous, high-minded, and, as you truly say, noble looking fellow! And in what estimation I secretly hold him, you will better understand, when I inform you, that my old acquaintance Howard, of whom you have often heard me speak, and Warrington are one, and the same person! You cannot be more surprised at this news than I was, myself, at the discovery. And not small was the confusion of thought and feeling, I experienced at first, I confess, in reconciling the warring conceptions I had previously entertained of these two, as I supposed them, different, and almost diametrically opposite characters. In this, however, I have at length succeeded, and even to that degree that I cannot but feel, that the character of Howard, pure and exalted as I ever thought it, receives an additional lustre from the noble and disinterested part he has taken in behalf of these poor, and as I am now satisfied, unjustly treated settlers. And with this avowal of opinion, you will of course understand that I think none the worse of him for being a New York outlaw. We have had three interviews. The two first I must pass over lightly, as I have much of a more interesting character to communicate. I first encountered Warrington in the border of the woods adjoining our opening, where I wandered, a fatalist would think, but to be frightened by the questionable appearance of a sergeant from the fort, and to be relieved by the opportune arrival of my knight errant Green Mountain boy. Our next meeting was at our house, where, in the course of the evening, he made known to me for the first time the identity of which I have spoken, and where also he came near being seized by this same sergeant and his soldiers, who, I feel sure, came here for no other purpose, being prompted by the reward, and instigated, as I cannot but suspect, by one who shall be nameless. But Warrington, and another of the leaders of the Green Mountan Boys, who happened here that evening, and who, by the way, was a most extraordinary man, fairly out-generaled their mercenary enemies, and, by a little favoring from a quarter which you are at liberty to guess at, both luckily made their escape. Our last interview has been to day, and a most important one, too, I fear it may prove, to the destinies of your perplexed, and in some respects, truly unhappy friend. But before entering upon particulars, I must recur to some events which transpired in the interim. The next day after W's visit and fortunate escape, Sherwood came here and raised a storm in our quiet family, which has not yet wholly ceased raging. It seems this sagacious lover of mine, who had often heard my father recount the Samaritan kindness of Howard, and perhaps suspected my own secret partialities, had discovered, by worming himself into the confidence of the settlers, that Howard and Warrington were the same, but, for reasons of his own, had kept the discovery entirely to himself, though he had been for several months in possession of the secret. It appears also, that he had been apprised of each of my interviews with Warrington. And coming armed with all this annihilating array of facts, as he believed it, he, without saying a word to me, called my father aside, and poured the whole story into his ears, with such additions and embellishments as he conceived would best subserve his purpose,—the amount of which was, as near as I could gather, that my father had been harboring a branded villain, who, in the guise of a gentleman, had been aiming at the seduction of his daughter, and the eventual seizure of his possessions. Trembling from head to foot with uncontrollable rage, my father immediately hastened to my apartment. I will not, I cannot, even attempt a description of the painful scene that followed. You are not unacquainted with my father's unfortunate infirmities of temper. You can 20* therefore, in some measure, fancy, perhaps, how he would feel and act under such a representation of things, so nearly affecting his wishes and interests— a representation, in which fact and falsehood were so artfully blended, that a much cooler temperament, under the circumstances, might have been thus wrought up to anger. He swore and wept alternately. I wept freely also, but only at witnessing his distress, and at the thought of my own luckless destiny, which had placed me in a situation where I must sacrifice my own happiness for life, or probably be the means of destroying that of a parent, who, with all his faults, is still dear to my heart. I said but little, however. Delicacy, as well as prudence, forbade my disclosing the state of my feelings. And as to all other charges, I could only assert my innocence, for I had then given Mr. W. scarce a word of encouragement. After my father had exhausted his store of reproaches upon my poor head and left me, Sherwood entered and took up the discourse. I could not but feel amused, in spite of my indignation and contempt at his dispicable course, to see all the doubling and shiftings he went through in his desperate attempts to regain my favor, which my manner probably pretty plainly told him he had put in considerable hazard. After protesting, flattering, apologizing, and arguing, with the sycophancy of a Frenchman and the sophistry of a Jesuit, he finally departed, leaving me to myself, and that negative happiness which his absence has not very lately failed to afford me. The next morning I reminded my father, whose madness seemed to have something more of method in it than the day before, of a visit which had a few days previous been projected at his own suggestion. This was a ride, on horseback, to Otter Creek to carry a few necessaries to a distant relative of ours, Aunt Story, as we call her, whose curious subterraneous abode I have before described to you, I believe. No serious objection being made to the proposal, I accordingly set out with Neshobee, my usual attendant on these excursions, who, on another horse, accompanied me in capacity of baggage man and squire. We had a pleasant ride, and arrived without any particular adventure at the Creek, opposite her wood-begirt residence. O how delightful is a morning ride at this season of the year through these flowering forests! How fragrant the viewless odours that regale your senses at almost every step! And, in the present instance, as you near the Green Mountains, how pure and invigorating the breezes that, seemingly uncontaminated by a contact with earth, come wafting down their dark sides fresh from the mid-heavens! I never approach these green hilled monuments of sylvan magnificence, but my physical powers receive an impulse, and my moral nature becomes sensibly exalted. No wonder the Green Mountain Boys should be men of such high-toned character! On reaching the banks of the Creek, Neshobee set up his shrill whoop (not war whoop) to make known our arrival to this fearless woman of the woods. This being heard and understood by her, she quickly made her appearance, came across with her boat, and ferried us all safe over the stream, our horses having been left tied to saplings on the bank behind. I must not stop to describe the cordial reception I met with, as I always do in this singular, yet interesting family; nor my romp with the curly headed brood of children that thronged around me, capering in wild glee at my arrival, and their eyes fairly sparkling with joy and gratitude at the sight of the titbits I had brought them. After the rumpus and romping with the joyous little creatures had somewhat subsided, I took the bright-eyed and lisping little Julia, in my lap; when the pretty rogue immediately clambering up, and putting her arms round my neck, in the sweet, pleading, and playful tones of infantile eloquence exclaimed, `Now, Couthin Alma, mayn't I kith you again?— there, I did! I will again! There! ha! ha! Now I have kithed you ath many timeth ath I did the Young Captain.' `And who, pray, my pretty one,' said I quite innocently, `who is this Young Captain with whom you appear to have been so familiar?' `O, he ith the Young Captain,' replied she, hesitating in her childish simplicity how to define her favorite by any other appellation than the one by which she had been accustomed to hear him called: `he ith—he ith a good Young Captain. I kithed him three timeth. And wouldn't you kith him too, Couthin Alma, if he'd let you? Wouldn't the Young Captain let Couthin Alma kith him, ma?' Puzzled and confused, at I scarcely knew what, I turned to the mother for an explanation; when, to my still greater confusion, I beheld her holding her sides, while her eyes were fairly dancing in the bright tears of suppressed risibility, to which she now gave way in a right hearty fit of laughter. `Excuse me, Alma,' said she, as soon as she could command her merry emotions sufficiently to speak `excuse me for laughing at the child's ludicrous introduction of a subject, which I was at the very moment thinking how I could myself break to you. The Young Captain, as some of the settlers call him, is no other than the well known leader of one of the bands of the Green Mountain Boys, Charles Warrington. Why, bless me!' she continued, with a look of surprise, as she now lifted her eyes from her work to my features, `What ails you, Alma? Why your face is as red as—Oh!—ah!—aha!— you knew all this before, did you? And you have seen him yourself, you rogue?' she added mischievously, shaking her finger at me, and fixing her keen eyes on my face; `You have, Alma, and you need not attempt to deny it.' `I have not denied it, aunt,—have I?' I replied, rallying as well as I could. `Well, now, Alma Hendee,' she rejoined, with a gratified and serious air, `I have not heard any thing this long while that has done me more good than this news. Indeed, for the past week in particular, I have actually prayed that you might meet him, though I dared not be the means of bringing it about. And the reason why I wished it is, because I think so much of the man, and feel such an interest in the cause which he has done so much to sustain; and, also, because I knew that you, from your intercourse and connection with the York party, and from your hearing, as you naturally would, nothing but slander and misrepresentation of the man, and curses on the cause in which he has been so nobly engaged, that you, I say, must have almost necessarily imbibed wholly erroneous opinions of both him and his cause—now, has it not been so?' `Such,' I answered, `was once, I confess, too much the case.' `I thought so,' she resumed, `and but for the fear, that I might displease you,—for I never knew how to hold up when I begin,—and, perhaps, be led into a quarrel with your fiery old father, who has been so good to me, I should, before this, have spoken to you on these matters. Why, this same Warrington and a party of his followers were up on Lake Dunmore the very day you were last here, and while you were here in the house playing with the children, I discovered, as I was out to the edge of the woods to get cedar boughs for a broom, a gang of Yorkers going in pursuit of them. Don't you reccollect I came in and proposed sending Neshobee out to kill us a partridge?' I remembered it, and assented. `Well,' she continued, `it was for no other purpose than to despatch him to Warrington with a note that I scribbled in that closet. Neshobee, I knew, was a friend to the Captain.' `Neshobee!' said I, in surprise, `why, I never heard him so much as utter the name!' `It is true for all that,' she rejoined; `Warrington once did him a service when they happened to meet on a hunt, and Neshobee, being made acquainted with the other's situation, and knowing yours, has been as prudent as he is faithful.' `But what became of the Yorkers?' I asked. `The Green Mountain Boys threw them into the lake and returned to this neighborhood,' she answered. `The Captain and his Lieutenant came and slept that very night in this house, and were here asleep on the floor, when I came up to the house, after helping you off the next morning. Do you remember singing us a song that night, just before going to bed, and how you were interrupted by a noise in the woods above us?' `I do, but what of that?' said I, somewhat startled. `Why, nothing,' she replied, smiling, `only Warrington, who rambled out, after his friend fell asleep, heard your performance.' `You astonish me, aunt Story,' I replied; `but surely he could not have distinguished my voice in that under-ground abode?' `Not exactly,' answered she, `and yet he was strangely puzzled, and seemed, when telling me of the affair the next morning, to have some suspicions of the truth.' `But did you tell him who it was?' I eagerly demanded. `No, Alma,' she said, `I kept your secret for reasons which I have before named, and sent him off worse puzzled than before. But how did he introduce himself—as Howard, or as Warrington? for that the two were one and the same, is a riddle that I guessed out long ago.' I told her the circumstances; after which she resumed, `So you have had a hurricane at your house. Well, Alma, let it blow on, and overturn, till it levels falsehood and corruption to the ground, and brings truth and justice uppermost. And when that takes place, if you will believe me, Jake Sherwood will be swept into the gulph of infamy, where he ought to be now, instead of being here among men, with the pretensions of a man, but with the real character of a spy and hypocrite!' `You are very severe, aunt,' I remarked, not so much offended, however, as I might have been. `I hold, Alma,' she rejoined, `that the boldness of a truth is no reason for suppressing its utterance. Why, Alma Hendee, whether you know it or not,— whether you will believe it or not, it is God's truth, that with all his smooth manners and gentlemanly appearance, the heart of that same Jacob Sherwood is as black as the outside of my dinner pot!' I began to say something which she took for a qualified assent, when cutting me short, she went on,— `You know that it is so, Alma. And now, that you have again met with Warrington, I know where your heart is, or I should not venture to say so much. Far be it from me ever to interfere with matches— matches that are truly such. But mis-matches, patched up on earth, and accursed of heaven, I should feel myself honored in being the instrument of breaking. And knowing, as I think I do, all the motives and circumstances which led you to acquiesce in this entanglement with Sherwood, and knowing, also, that a match between you would be yoking darkness to light, I stand prepared, as your friend, acting in the place of your sainted mother, now in heaven, to advise you to say, even in despite of the favorite schemes of your mistaken and blinded father, to say to Sherwood, as Peter said to Simon Magus, who would buy the sacred gift with money, 'Thy gold perish with thee!' A long conversation then ensued between us, in which all the information possessed by either, relative to the York controversy, and the part taken in the same by Warrington, Sherwood, and others, was mutually imparted and received, and our opinions and feelings on these subjects freely exchanged. While still engaged on this engrossing theme, one of the children came running into the house with the cry, `The Young Captain is coming! the Young Captain is coming!' I was struck dumb by this unexpected announcement, and so surprised and fluttered, that, had I been a bird, I believe I should have instantly clapped my wings and flown away. But as it was, I had nothing to do but prepare to meet the half dreaded, half courted danger, as unconcernedly as possible. We had little time allowed us for preparation, however; for scarce had the announcement been made, before Warrington entered the door attended by—whom think you, Jessey? I wish you could have been there! In that case, to follow up that odd comparison of yours, the brisk little drummer in your heart would have found his match, I think, to keep up the accompaniment with the lively performer at work in my own: for Captain Warrington's attendant was no other than your favored knight, the gay, witty, and handsome Selden. An hour spent in his company was sufficient to make me feel that these flattering epithets, and even more, might be justly applied to him. Now don't be jealous, girl, for though peculiarly pleased with him, I certainly was, yet my feelings were any thing but those constituting, what we define to be that undefinable concern, called love—no, no, not that, but a singular sort of a flowing away of the heart towards him, which I can neither describe nor account for, unless the solution be found in the prepossessions of him that your letter had implanted. We were now summoned to a dinner, which our free-hearted hostess had done her best in preparing for us. The meal itself, as you know it must have been, considering the limited store from which it had to be prepared, was certainly a plain one. But partaken in such company, how could it be other than a delightful one! With me, it forcibly exemplified 21 the proverb of the wise man, `Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.' After dinner, Warrington, with his peculiar delicacy of manner, proposed a ramble. My tongue would have declined the proposal, but my heart, rising in rebellion, suppressed the utterance, and I, silently, and with a palpitating bosom, assented. All seemed to understand the object of our walk, and no one, not even a child, offered to accompany us. I felt, indeed, myself, that my destiny for life hung on the events of that hour. We proceeded in almost unbroken silence to the bank of the river; when I soon found myself seated, I scarcely know how, by his side, upon a flowery hillock. The quiet waters, sparkling in the rays of the meridian sun, were gently gliding along in soft murmurs at our feet; while a spreading thorn tree, loaded with blosoms of snowy whiteness, and filling the air with delicious fragrance, formed the canopy for our heads. I cannot describe what now passed. My heart soon overflowed with contending emotions. I found myself able to prevail against its stronger dictates no longer; and my feelings found vent in a flood of tears. My head involuntarily rested on his shoulder, while he advocated his cause with all the tender pathos of love, which found a chord in my own bosom so powerfully responsive to its eloquent pleadings that, `Then our hearts together run; And like kindred drops of water, Met, and mingled into one.' The winged moments flew by unheeded; and when, at the end of an hour, which, in this sweet trance of the affections, seemed as a moment, we rose to return, our mutual vows of unchanging love and eternal constancy, had ascended to the registry of Heaven. Soon after our return to the house, the gentlemen apprised us of the necessity of their immediate departure; when, after an affectionate adieu, they proceeded on their destination. This destination I am not at liberty to unfold, and shall consequently be debarred from some particulars connected with my parting with W. which awakened a solicitude alike new and painful to my feelings. I did not tarry long after they left us. But after a shower of thanks, praises and blessings from our hostess, for the step, which I apprised her I had taken, I soon set out for home, where I arrived before sunset. On another page of this letter I styled myself your perplexed friend. I am so, though not because I regret the step I have taken, but on account of the difficulties which must soon beset me. I have also many painful apprehensions of the effect which my engagement may have, when it becomes known, as ere long it necessarily must, on, not only my father's happiness, but his property, owing to the peculiarities of our situation. As these cannot be understood without a knowledge of some former events connected with our family, I will, in confidence, briefly relate to you the leading particulars of our family history. My paternal grandfather's family consisted of my uncle Gabriel Hendee, and my father James Hendee, with their half sister Mary, who married John Sherwood, father of Jacob Sherwood. To these three was left a considerably extensive property, which was increased, as far as regarded the shares of Gabriel, and his brother in law, Sherwood, who, becoming partners, engaged in the lucrative trade and commerce of the Connecticut river, on the banks of which, within the borders of Massachusetts, you are already aware, we all once resided. But my father, who was of a different disposition and less inclined to confine himself to the details of business, entered into uncertain speculations, which, instead of increasing, diminished his original inheritance, involved him in some pecuniary embarrassments, and finally led him to abandon trade, for which he seemed to have neither much tact nor inclination, and seek a commission in the army, destined for the French and Indian wars, then beginning to rage along our borders. Obtaining the commission he sought, he was soon called into active service, having entrusted Sherwood to arrange his affairs and take charge of his property; while uncle Gabriel, having no family, and becoming an invalid, retired from business, and came to reside with our family in father's absence. Several years thus passed away, father at intervals returning home to see his wife and son, the darling little Edward, and spend such time with them as his public duties would permit, scarcely troubling himself to look into the state of his property, which he believed to be in hands where it would be husbanded to the best advantage. My uncle Gabriel in the meanwhile still continuing to live in the family, and appearing much attached to it, especially to his little nephew, made his will, bequeathing his whole property to the child, when of age, and all the income till that time, and certain portions of it after, to my father. But it so happened not long after this that Mr. Sherwood, who had taken a temporary residence further up the river, paid our family a long visit, at the end of which he took my uncle home with him, where he soon grew worse and died; not however, as it soon appeared, till he had added a codicil to his will, making, in case of Edward's death, Mr. Sherwood's son, Jacob, legatee, and placing that family where the will placed ours. From that time misfortunes seemed to fall fast and heavy on our devoted family. My mother soon sickened and died, leaving me, her youngest child, about a year old. Our family establishment was then broken up. Edward was placed in the family of Mr. Sherwood; and I was sent to a relation of my mother in Hartford. But father, already borne down with sorrow at the loss of two wives, (for my mother was a second wife by whom he had no other child,) was doomed to another blow scarcely less fatal to his happiness, and more so to his future prospects, in the further loss of that son, on whom all his hopes and dependance had been placed. The boy had been allowed, as the story was told, to accompany a reckless young man, then in Sherwood's employ, many miles into the interior, and there strayed away, and never could be found. There was a rapid river running through the woods, in which he might have been drowned, and swept down into the Connecticut. But it was considered more probable, that he had been seized by some small, lurking band of Indians, (traces of whom were discovered in the vain search for the boy,) and by them murdered, as it was supposed, since no tidings of him ever reached us. My father, when he returned, and learned the fate of his son, was inconsolable. And Mr. Sherwood seemed deeply to sympathize with him, and moreover to manifest great regret that uncle had so altered his will as to take all his property from our family, assuring my father that he would make such provision for us as would be a recompence. After this visit my father remained abroad to the close of the war, when, being discharged from the service, he began to bethink him about the means of a future livelihood, and called on Sherwood to account for his property, which, to his dismay, had dwindled to a mere pittance. And receiving it, he commenced a small business in Hartford, where he resided till I was about seventeen, living in good style, and bestowing on me the best education the place afforded. But again becoming embarrassed by expenses beyond his income, and his pride revolting at the thought of being a bankrupt in this place, he took me, and secretly left town for Albany, to avail himself of the many promises of Mr. Sherwood, who had removed to the latter place many years before. We were kindly received by Mr. S., who furnished father with money to pay off his creditors in Hartford, and subsequently to purchase our present residence, though most of the improvements have been made through the means of the half pay which he receives from government. You will now, Jessy, be able to appreciate the difficulties of my situation, and perceive the reasons which actuate my father in the strenuous course which he has pursued, and will be likely still to pursue, in urging a connection between me and Jacob Sherwood. Jessy, adieu. A. H. P. S. When I closed as above, last night, I expected the letter would have been taken early this morning by Major Skeen's colored man, Jack, who said he should go up with his boat to-day; but he has just called and says he shall not go till to-morrow morning. The main object of this postcript is, however, to say, that if you thought it so important that I should keep your secret, you cannot but see how much more so it is that you keep mine. I know not but Mr. Warrington's life may depend on it—I did not mean to say this, but my fears and forebodings have compelled me. You do not know Mr. S.—would to heaven I had never known him.—Farewell. Alma. END OF VOLUME ONE.</field>
