      <field name="fulltext">TO THE READER. Though some of the personages, and a portion of the incidents of the following tale, are either historical or traditionary, it makes no pretensions to the dignity of a historical romance. The design was, to convey to the mind of the reader some idea of the spirit, the sufferings, and the sacrifices of a class of people who are seldom, if ever, individualized in history, yet who always bear the brunt of war and invasion. The hero of the piece once actually existed, and exhibited in his youth many of the qualities here ascribed to him. Some of the adventures detailed were well remembered by the old people of the neighborhood; few, if any, of whom are now living. Others took place in different parts of the country, at various times; and the whole may suffice to give at least a faint picture of the price paid by our fathers and mothers for the freedom we enjoy. The value of the blessing may in some measure be estimated by the sacrifices by which it was obtained. The tale was substantially written several years ago; and the author, after keeping it more than the period prescribed by Horace, has now given it a last revision. New York, 1844.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1* THE OLD CONTINENTAL; OR, THE PRICE OF LIBERTY. BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE DUTCHMAN'S FIRESIDE,” &amp;c., &amp;c. IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I. CHAPTER I. IN WHICH MUCH IS SAID, AND LITTLE DONE. During the most gloomy and disastrous period of our revolutionary war, there resided in the county of Westchester a family of plain country people, who had, in time long past, seen better days; but who now had nothing to boast of, but a small farm, a good name, and a good conscience. Though bred in the city, they had lived so long in a retired part of the country, that their habits, tastes, and manners, had become altogether rural, and they had almost outlived every vestige of former refinements, except in certain modes of thinking, and acting, which had survived in all changes of time and circumstances. Their residence was an old stone-house, bearing the date of 1688, the figures of which were formed by Holland bricks, incorporated with the walls. The roof was green with mossy honours, and the entire edifice bore testimony, not only to the lapse of time, but to the downhill progress of its inmates. Though not in ruins, it was much decayed; and, though with a good rousing fire in the broad capacious chimney, it was comfortable enough in winter, it afforded nothing without to indicate anything but the possession of those simple necessaries of life, which fall to the lot of those who derive their means of happiness from the labours of their hands, the bounties of the earth, and the blessing of a quiet soul. The old stone-house stood on the brow of a little knoll, fronting a stream something between a brook and a river, that meandered and murmured among willows and alders, at the foot of a range of high hills, which approached not so near but that they left long strips of rich meadows between their base and the banks of the stream. In the rear of the house, at no great distance, was a pond of some half a mile in circumference, and so shallow, in many places, that a variety of aquatic shrubs grew out above the surface, where congregated clouds of black-birds, whose music made but poor amends for their depredations on the newly planted corn-fields. This was not the only music; for, of a still summer evening, the sonorous bull-frog ever and anon twanged his horn, accompanied by a mingled variety of strange harmonies, that we can only compare with the inexplicable jargon of a fashionable overture. In those days, too, the young plough-boys, and milkmaids sometimes sung their rustic ditties, with blithesome hearts, mornings and evenings, until the harsh dissorence of the trumpet, calling to deeds of bloody strife, scared away all other music, and the rural retreats of our country no longer resounded to the laugh or the song. Indeed, the latter seems to have been scared away forever. Those rural ballads are now scarcely ever heard in the quiet retreats of our country; whether it be that the long and arduous struggles, severe sufferings, and perpetual anxieties of our people, during seven years of bloody war, have given a sober, thoughtful, anxious cast to their characters, or that the possession of freedom, like every worldly blessing, has its drawbacks in new cares for ourselves and our offspring, new solicitudes and new responsibilities. The spot I have thus slightly sketched, seemed consecrated to rural happiness and rural virtue. And so it was, and so it long had been; but the time had now come when that destiny which had carried our forefathers from the old, followed and overtook them in the new world. They left their native land to escape a despotism equally exercised over mind and body. They sought the wilderness of the west, to enjoy in the new world, that seemed to have been discovered on purpose, that freedom of the soul, more precious than all other freedom. But bigotry and persecution, those bloody and remorseless fiends that so often assume the livery of the Prince of Peace, still followed them in the disguise of political devices, calling for new sacrifices, new struggles, and new sufferings. The rights and privileges, for which they had sacrificed everything in the home of their fathers, were now to be once more asserted and maintained for the home of their children. A contest had commenced, in which a proud and arrogant parent offered every wrong and violence which power could inflict, or weakness endure. There was no longer safety in the cities, or repose in the cottage. It was not only a war against men, but against women, children, and domestic animals; against the labours of husbandmen, and the bounties of the earth. The hen-roost and the pig-stye, were no longer the prey of four-footed prowlers, but of gallant soldiers; and no man could reasonably hope either to reap where he had sown, or eat the bread he had earned by the sweat of his brow. It was not alone the foreign mercenaries of a misguided monarch that assailed the peaceful inhabitants who dwelt in the district which is the scene of our story. The army of the invader had now established its head quarters in New York, and the Americans were sheltered from a far superiour foe, in the Highlands of the Hudson. The intermediate space from Kingsbridge, or Spuytey Duyvel, was consequently a sort of “debateable land,” like the English and Scottish borders, before the union of the two kingdoms. It was occupied by neither party, and it might almost be said there was neither law or gospel there. The farmers of this region, who remained at home, some because they did not know where else to go; some from being too old to remove; and some, perhaps, in the vain hope that neutrality would protect them from the ravages of war, were placed between two fires. Such peculiar situations are always, in these troubled times, the scenes of violence and devastation; the resort of reckless, unprincipled villains, belonging to neither party, yet a disgrace to both, from alternately passing, as occasion required, for adherents of one or the other. Beyond the sphere of military coercion, or the restraints of civil authority, it is here that the plunderer and ravisher luxuriates in unrestrained violence, and weakness and innocence become his unresisting prey. The enemy, in small parties, made almost daily incursions from New York, and the sad domestic history of those melancholy times, if it were written down from the lips of those who suffered and survived their calamities, a few of whom yet live to relate them, would tell, what has never yet been told, the price at which liberty and independence were bought. On the other hand, bands of lawless tories of native growth, aided by a class of worthless outlaws belonging to no party, but scourges to both, scoured the country at night, robbing the houses, and often setting them on fire; stealing the cattle, insulting and maltreating the wretched women and children, and not unfrequently murdering the poor victims they had dispoiled. The devoted inhabitants had no heart to labour, except from extreme necessity; the fields were fruitful only of weeds and briars; the fences destroyed, the windows broken; the roads, as far as could be seen, presented no living object, and as is ever the case, under a perpetual succession of suffering, the minds of the inhabitants had settled down into the dead calm of apathy or despair. The little narrow vale, I have been describing, being several miles from the high road, leading along the bank of the Hudson, had hitherto, in a great degree, if not entirely, escaped the ravages either of the red-coats, the Yagers, or outlawed scum, all whose varieties were included in the expressive denomination of Cow Boys and Skinners. But every day, and more especially every night, afforded indications that the tempest was gradually approaching nearer and nearer. As the country along the river became exhausted of the means of satisfying these lawless plunderers, whose exploits, we earnestly hope, will never, like those of the Scottish border thieves, become the theme of poetic eulogium—they diverged from the high road, and penetrated into the interior. Now it was that those who had hitherto escaped the scourge, trembled for their property and their lives. The farmers no longer rejoiced in the prospect of a golden harvest, which they never expected to reap; the women lay awake at night—trembling at every whispering leaf, or breath of air; and the children fled from their cherished sports, at the cry of “the Yagers are coming!” These Yagers were a band of foreign mercenaries, hired by our mother country to assist in our subujation; and being totally ignorant of the grounds of the quarrel, as well as, beyond doubt, stimulated by the most cruel misrepresentations of the motives and character of the people of the United States, are noted in the traditions of the times for a thousand acts of ruthless barbarity. Little did they think they were warring against themselves, and those rights, the enjoyment of which is now so anxiously sought by thousands of their countrymen. The family at the old stone-house consisted of an aged couple, whose snow-white locks and stooping figures bore testimony to a long pilgrimage through this vale of tears; one son, and a grandson of some nineteen years old. The son had gone forth to give aid to his country in her hour of peril, and was now with the army of Washington. The grandson, whose name was John, remained at home, sorely against his will, to assist in the management of the farm. But he longed to go forth and fight by the side of his father, and frequently joined parties of militia in expeditions towards Kingsbridge to gain information of the movements of the enemy, or to protect the inhabitants from the Yagers, the Skinners, and the Cow Boys. On one of these occasions he had greatly distinguished himself, and received the thanks of the gallant Colonel Philip Van Courtlandt, who commanded the outposts at Peekskill. He was handsome, active, and possessed an intrepidity, as well as cool self-possession in time of danger, that qualifies a man to become a leader in all desperate or trying occasions. During the first fourteen years of his life, he had been brought up in the city of New York, where he received every advantage of education, until the misfortunes of his father compelled him to join his parents on the farm, now their only possession. One evening, in the lazy month of August, the family were in quiet chat under an old willow-tree, just at the door. The party consisted only of the old people, John, and a young woman named Jane, the only daughter of Colonel Hammond, a near neighbour, who had served in the old French war and performed divers brilliant exploits not recorded in history. The conversation naturally turned on the state of their country, and the probability of ere long receiving a visit from the red coats, the Yagers, or the outlaws, to whom allusion has previously been made. Its tone was saddened by gloomy forebodings, for nothing is more depressing to the mind than perpetual fears, and were it not that people become used to them, as to every other evil, their perpetual recurrence would be intolerable. The aged couple had made up their minds to endure all that might come with patient acquiescence; but the youth, though he said not a word, exhibited in the bright energies of his fiery eye, a far different determination. After a long pause, the old man, as if suddenly recovering himself, turned to him, and said— “So, John, you were out last night. Did you see anything besides the stars?” “I saw brighter lights than the stars, sir,” replied John. “Aye! what were they—the lights of the north?” “Only a couple of houses burning. They made the country smile for miles around. It was a glorious sight, sir,” said the young man with bitter irony. “What, the red coats were out, hey?” “Yes, sir, the red coats—at least, I suppose so— though when we came up there were none there. They had reaped the harvest of glory and retired.” “No, no, John,” said the good woman, who still, like all the colonists, especially women, cherished a great 2 respect for red coats, until roused by injuries to resentment and resistance; “no, John, not the red coats—the tories and the Yagers.” “All one to me, mother”—so he always called her after the death of his own—“British, or tories, or Yagers. They all hoist the same flag—they are all in the pay of the same employer. Master and man, like man and wife, are one flesh. I hold them all alike, and treat them so, when I meet them.” “Ah! John, John! you should not bear malice. Remember, we are commanded to forgive our enemies, persecutors, and slanderers.” “I know it, mother, and when our country is free, and not an enemy's foot-print is to be seen on our soil, I will obey the command; but while they are every day inflicting new injuries, I cannot forgive them.” “Right, John—you say right,” exclaimed the old man; “and I almost wish you were old enough to be a soldier. I could find in my heart to send you after your father, to fight by the side of Washington.” “Old enough or not, sir, I must go. I can't stay here any longer. Yesterday, I was pointed at by old Mrs. Read, who has three sons in the army, as a booby tied to his grandmother's apron-string, instead of being among men, defending his country.” “The wicked old woman!” said Jane, in a half whisper. “I'll tell you at once,” continued John, “for it must out at last. I am going this very night with a party, to see if we can't catch some of the rascals who steal our cattle under cover of darkness, and run away by the light of the burning houses.” “Don't go—I beseech you not to go, John,” cried the old grandmother, earnestly. “I entreat you not to go!” cried Jane, tenderly. “And I,” exclaimed the old man, “command—no! God forbid I should prevent your doing anything to serve our cause and our country!” “I must go, for I have given my word. I must be off bright and early in the morning, to procure a pass from Colonel Philip Van Courtlandt, and shall hardly be back in time to meet our neighbours at the Hole. We are to scout during the night towards Kingsbridge, and must be off as soon as it is dark.” “Alas!” said Jane, “what can you raw country boys do against the red coats?” “Whatever stout hearts and strong arms can do, Jane,” rejoined the other. “Don't you remember that blessed little David, the peasant-boy after God's own heart? how, just as if to humble the pride of the proud invader, Providence armed him with a sling and a stone, to overcome Goliah? The destinies of empires, Jane, is always in the hands of a brave and virtuous people, let them be ever so poor. Our cause is that of the lowly against the exalted, and it is for poor men to maintain it.” “But, John—John!” cried the grandmother. But John heard her not. He had relapsed into an old habit of abstraction, common to minds of a higher order, and strengthened by being much alone. He began talking to himself, though his voice was raised, and his eye kindled with animation. “I never read that glorious story of little David, without thinking how much is in the power of every man, if it pleases God. A sling and a stone! I have a musket and a sword, and for a good cause—a cause more just and noble never breathed fire into the soul of man. The arm of Heaven was against the Philistine, and will it not be on our side, too? But come what will, one thing I know—if a good chance happens, my name shall ring.” “There—there—now the boy has got on his high horse again! He grows madder every day. Ring, indeed! It will never be heard as far as a cow-bell, John,” cried the old woman, impatiently. “Yes, ring, mother. I feel as if I could do something to be remembered if it comes in my way, and if it don't come, I will seek it. What is it, after all, that rules the world, but courage and daring? Yonder strutting game-cock reigns over the poultry-yard, not because his father reigned before him, but by fighting his way to power. So with all, except the race of mankind which claims to wield the sceptre by right of superior intellect, and yet is continually conceding it to fools and cowards. By my soul, I think a man with the heart of a true game-chicken, may be just what he pleases in a strife like this.” “The Lord be with you, John!” sighed the old woman, “you will be shot one of these days.” “It shall not be for cowardice, or mutiny, then. All flesh must die, and fish, too, either yesterday, to-day, or to-morrow. A good deed is better than a long life, and to die for our country is to live forever.” “The boy talks like a parson. It wasn't for nothing his father sent him to the academy in New York,” said the old man. “Ah! John—you will be shot one of these days, I tell you. Remember, life is sweet!” sighed the old grandmother. “Only a bitter, which long tasting makes sweet, mother. But I must go and get ready, for I must start before daylight. Jane, shall I see you home, for it is getting dusky. I want to talk to you about the little ducks and chickens,” said John, sportively, and they went away together. “Ducks and chickens!” quoth the dame. “The sly rogue! Did you hear that?” “To be sure I did—I know they love each other dearly.” “I'm glad of it with all my heart, for Jane is a nice girl. But what will the colonel say to it? He is rich and proud, and we are poor and lowly, and what little we have may be laid waste before to-morrow. The colonel loves money, I believe, better than even his daughter.” “Yes—so he does—so he does,” replied the old man, thoughtfully. “But who knows but John's queer notions about making his name ring may come true in the end? They say, some people have a sort of insight into what is to come, long before it happens. Who knows?” “Who, indeed! Strange things happen in war-time. I have heard the great Washington was but a farmer's son.” “Well—well—old folks that can do nothing but talk must trust to Providence, and those that can, take care of themselves. I must make up for John's absence by stirring my old stumps a little more actively.” 2* “And so must I; but I wish from my heart the boy was safe home again from his trip to Kingsbridge,” exclaimed the good soul, with her apron to her eyes. They then retired to their humble bed, and Providence, for that night, blessed them with a repose undisturbed by Cow Boys, Skinners, or red coats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. A LOVE SCENE SPOILED BY AN OLD CONTINENTAL. John and his gentle companion pursued their way lazily towards the home of the damsel, by a path which wound through the green meadows along the joyous stream that twittered blithely as it slipped over the white pebbles, and was so narrow in some places that their arms intertwined with each other in spite of themselves. It is true, they might have walked Indian file, that is, one before the other, but this never occurred to either. The long twilight of a summer day was now gradually subsiding into the deeper shades of approaching night; the bright star, consecrated to the queen of love and beauty, hovered low over the dark outlines of the adjacent hills, and had, for its companion, the graceful new moon, which, in the form of a silver Indian bow, hung suspended in the heavens. Like John and his darling maiden, they seemed alone in the skies, as the others were on the earth, for the crowd of lagging stars had not yet made their appearance. All nature seemed sunk on a bed of down, in soft, luxurious repose, and the enervating warmth of the weather, while it deprived the body of its elastic vigour, made ample amends, by quickening the finer feelings of the soul to sweeter and brighter aspirations. It was a dangerous hour for the wicked, and those whose passions tyrannize over all the ties of faith and duty; but it offered to pure and virtuous affection only a gentle excitement, which, while adding to love additional fervour, detracted nothing from its purity. They walked for a while without either uttering a word, for silence is twin sister to love. The young man was thinking over those dim visions of the future, which, ever since the commencement of the struggle for freedom, had shared with Jane the empire of his heart. The two were, indeed, inseparably associated; he loved his country and his mistress, and all his hopes of possessing the one, were founded on serving the other. The young girl was occupied with her fears and anticipations. She, indeed, possessed, in common with the noble race of our revolutionary matrons, that holy spirit of patriotism which inspired the men of that memorable era, whose consequences have confounded the calculations of philosophers who draw their theories from the past history of mankind. It was this spirit which animated their resistance, nerved their arms, inspired their souls, and finally enabled the peaceful cultivators of the earth to wrest from boundless wealth, disciplined armies, and almost irresistible power, the most glorious prize for which nations ever contended. But there is in the heart of a true woman, a gentle, we may say, a happy inclination to yield to the softer impulses of the heart. They love the brave, and worship at the shrine of glory; but when the period arrives for them to choose between the danger of one they love, and the chance of acquiring rank or fame, amid the perils of war, the sacrifice, if made at all, is made with fear and anguish, and the penalty of disappointment paid by a broken heart. Such were the feelings which checked the tongue of Jane, and repressed every expression, except what might be augured from a long and heavy sigh, which ever and anon heaved in her throbbing bosom. The struggle was more painful than obstinate, for she had made up her mind, for sometime, never, let what might come, to dissuade him from the performance of his duty to his country. They were now in sight of the mansion of her father, which was the best in twenty miles round, and its owner the greatest man, in his own opinion, in the county. He had fought in the old French war under Putnam, and had his leg broken at the scaling of Ticonderoga; in proof of which honourable achievement, he limped all the rest of his life, and told the story every day. Colonel Hammond was a passionate old gentleman; but this was excusable, since it was observed by his neighbours, that whenever the colonel got angry, and swore by “Thunder and Mars,” it was always a prelude to some act of kindness or generosity. He was somewhat wilful, as well as way-ward, having long since lost his wife, who by her good temper, good sense, and steadiness of purpose governed both his will and actions, without his having the slightest suspicion of being, what he scorned beyond every other species of disgrace, namely, an obedient husband. He was, withal, somewhat of a humourist, and being rather addicted to expletives, had adopted a system of swearing, by the aid of which, he communicated great energy to his conversation, without breaking a single commandment. We are of opinion it was altogether original with the good gentleman, seeing he died before Bob Acres came into the world. It is only necessary to add, that he was exceedingly addicted to projects and inventions, none of which ever proved of the least service to himself or the world. He admired John, who was a frank, bold, vivacious fellow; but like many wise men, he liked him not as a son-in-law, and forgot that his daughter did not see through his spectacles. John had lately laughed at a pet invention of the colonel's, for catching moles, and had been, in consequence, under the ban of the old gentleman. It was, therefore, prudent for the young couple to part at the entrance of the little grove, that screened them from observation. This necessity unlocked their tongues, and Jane was the first to speak. “Let us part, now,” said she, “you know you are in disgrace, and my father will be angry at seeing us together.” “I know it, Jane. He looks down on me now. It shall not be my fault, if he don't look up to me before many years are past, if the war continues.” “You are much given to boasting, lately, John. Have you dreamed a dream, or seen a vision, or had your fortune told by Hagar Raven?” asked she, with a glistening eye. “No, Jane, I rest my hopes on a fixed determination to gain your father's consent at all risks, and I know that to a brave old soldier, like him, there is no recommendation like courage. Night and day, so help me heaven, I will never rest contented, till I have done something to deserve your love, and his approbation. I will never ask you of him, until I feel I deserve you, and will win my way to your arms or those of death. “Oh! don't talk so! You could not bear to think of death if you loved me. Since—since—what has passed between us, I never think of death without shuddering. Before that, I loved none but my father, but that love did not make me fear death; go now— and I charge you, as you love me, to take care of yourself. Do you indeed love me?” “Love you? ah! dearest Jane, I love you better than liberty, for I would be your slave. I love you better than selfish beings love themselves—better than brave men love danger, or cowards safety. But I must now leave you. One kiss—but one. I know it is wrong, but it may be our last. The parting was sealed by a modest kiss, a parting embrace. Just at the moment, the colonel, who had been setting his mole-trap in an adjacent field, having heard their voices, approached in somewhat of a towering passion. “Thunder and Mars!” thought he, “a turtle dove in white dimity cooing to a mate in gray homespun. I have told that puppy fifty times he shan't have Jane, though he never asked me the question, and only the other day forbid him my house. The young rascal! to laugh at my mole-trap—and I've told Jane fifty times a-day, for months past, she shan't marry that beggarly stripling, so she couldn't possibly forget it. Not but that the puppy's a clever lad, too; the best rider, the best shot, the best runner and wrestler, aye, and the best scholar, too, in the county. I believe he knows more than I do; and as for courage, he'd eat fire for breakfast, dinner and supper before he'd turn his back on friend or foe. Confound me, if I don't sometimes think I like the fellow—but then he's poor— he wants the one thing needful, without which a man is no better than an empty purse, or a pocket turned inside out. What will become of all my improvements if I am obliged to maintain him and all his brats; for the poorer a man is, the more is he blessed with mouths to eat out what little he has? What will become of my canal from Sawmill to Byram river, which I mean to make navigable if I can only get water enough? and what will become of my patent cider press, my horizontal wheel, and my perpendicular axle-tree? It wont do—it wont do—I can't spare anything from my improvements. Hey—what—thunder and fire!” As the worthy colonel thus communed with the inward man, the young puppy and the young damsel were standing still as mice; for though they had gone through all the preliminaries of a long farewell, they seemed inclined to begin again. Just at this moment John wound his trembling arm around the slender waist of Jane, which, though innocent of whalebone, was but a span, and drawing her to his bosom, compressed one more last memento on her rosy lips. A blush and a tear mingled together on her glowing cheek, and she reproached him for his freedom, with a quivering lip. The choleric colonel could endure this no longer—he came upon them as fast as his lame leg would permit, and was just in time to interrupt the ceremony of another last farewell. “Thunder and Mars!” roared he, “what is all this? I'll send one of you to perdition, and disinherit the other. So madam—so sir—I say what does all this mean. Do you take this puppy for a young sapling that you cling about him like a grape vine? Hey— confound your pictures, what does all this mean, I say?” It would be a subject worthy the deepest investigation of a philosopher, who had nothing else to employ him, why it is that the bravest spirit, when detected in the act of saluting a woman, though ever so innocently, at night, or what is still more embarrassing, by the light of the moon—except it be his great-aunt or his grandmother—looks and feels just for all the world as if he had been caught robbing a hen-roost. John could look danger in the face, as an eagle does the sun; he was as brave as a game chicken, but at this moment, he could neither flap his wings or crow. He looked very much like a rooster, who, in country phrase, “runs under,” when detected by the master spirit of the farm yard, paying his devoirs to a young pullet. He was not dead, but he was certainly speechless. Jane, however, who was accustomed to the colonel's explosion of wrath, and a woman, besides, retained more self-possession, and with something like modest artlessness, replied to his question, of what all this meant. “It is only our last parting, dear father.” “Only our last parting dear father,” reiterated the colonel—“It looks more like your last meeting, for 3 you seemed as if you never meant to part again. But where is the puppy going? To join the red coats, I suppose, or plunder some of the farmers down below—hey, blood and fire!” “No, father, he is going to fight for his country.” “What, between the lines, I suppose—to rob both sides, hey!—I've a great mind to carry him before that obstinate old blockhead, Squire Day, and have him hanged for a Cow Boy.” “Take care what you say, colonel,” said John, brushing up at this opprobrious charge. “Take care what I say? I'll say what I please, and do what I please on my own ground. I'll seize you for a trespasser, and lock you up in the cellar, sir, and then what would you do, hey?” “Why, colonel, my present impression is, that I would run away myself, and if possible, persuade Jane to go with me.” “You would, would you? Thunder and Mars! I only wish I was the man I was before the old French war, when I summoned old Ti, and surrounded a corporal's guard, that surrendered at discretion. By the Lord, I'd make you measure land by the yard faster than you ever did before. Hey! John, did you ever hear that story of old Ti?” “Never, that I recollect—at least since you last told it,” added he, in a low tone—for he knew that nothing in this world tickled the old continental so much as telling the story to one who never heard it before. “Nor read it in history?” asked the colonel. “Never, sir.” “What an ignoramus—and what a sieve is history; only it lets out the grain, and retains the chaff. But, what am I talking about here, when the dew is falling in showers, and the fog rising like smoke in a battle. Look you, Jane, do you love this young puppy? Why don't you answer instead of standing as dumb and as deaf as a copper-head? Do you love this great scholar, who never heard of my taking Ticonderoga? Tell me the honest truth, if a woman can possibly be honest on such an occasion. Out with it, and don't pretend to be too modest after what I have just seen.” It was now Jane's turn to be silent; and in this unnatural, unfeminine state, she continued, her head hanging down, and her forehead red with blushes, though she had answered that question scores of times to a certain person. The colonel then turned to John, and proposed the same interrogatory. “With all my soul, sir—I would die for her if necessary.” “You would? A bargain—get a halter out of the stable yonder, and hang yourself only for fifteen minutes, and on the honour of an old continental, you shall marry Jane the next hour if you can only make the responses, and we can find a parson or justice of peace, who is not a rank tory. Mind, I except Squire Day, who is such an obstinate old fool, that ten to one, he will contradict the whole ceremony. What say you, John?—hey, boy!” “I say, colonel, that if it were not for Jane, your lame leg, and your gray hairs, I would answer you not with a word, but a blow.” “A blow! Do I live to hear, and does the man live that threatens me a blow? Thunder and fire! But if you survive the other business, you shall give me satisfaction. Jane, I'm sorry for you—you'll be a widow before sunset to-morrow. I say, Jane, how would you like to lose your sweetheart—hey?” “How would you like to lose your daughter, sir,” replied Jane. “What—hey—is it come to that? Drowning or poisoning, or pining away to a shadow! Very well —very exceeding well, my dutiful daughter. You'd rather he'd shoot your poor old father, I suppose. You'd prefer being an orphan to a widow—hey? Faith, he's no beauty, I must confess—he is not as tall and as straight `as a poplar tree,' nor are `his cheeks as red as a rose.' He can't jump over a seven rail fence without touching it with his hand, nor talk sentiment like a ballad monger, nor lie like an almanac maker. He's past say, as the French used to call it at Old Ti. But to the point. Do you love this most respectful puppy, who threatens to knock your father on the head, except for two or three substantial reasons? Out with it—tell the truth, which I know before hand. Remember, there never has been a lie told in my family since the declaration of independence. Do you love him, I say?” “I can't deny it, father, with the same lips that have often uttered the confession.” “Upon my word! Signed, sealed, and delivered, as that obstinate old blockhead, Squire Day, says. But it won't do, I tell you, it won't do. The conveyance is not legal; and you, sir,” turning short on John, “you will accept the conveyance of this dutiful daughter, hey?” “When I have made myself worthy of her, and not before,” replied John. “I mean to gain a reputation equal to that of the brave officer, her father, before I ask him to give me his daughter.” “Hum—brave officer—that's sensibly said, but it won't do, John—you must make yourself rich, and then you will be worthy in my sight.” “Rich, sir! I never thought of that. I mean to serve my country—that will make me worthy of any man's daughter.” “Ha! ha! hum—well, John, I can't but say I like your idea. I am a cool, calculating man, as all the world allows, except that obstinate old blockhead, Squire Day, who, by-the-bye, I suspect is a rank tory in his heart. I shouldn't be surprised if he had a British protection in his pocket at this moment. And, John—Thunder and Mars! what are you gaping at that girl for, instead of listening to what I am saying?” “I was only reading her thoughts, sir.” “Well, and what may she be thinking about?” “She was thinking how you could be so cruel as to bring tears in the eyes, and sorrow to the heart, of one who has been your solace in health, your nurse in sickness, and, to the utmost extent of her duty and affection, has supplied to you the loss of her dear mother.” This touched the old continental to the quick. He cherished the memory of his wife, who had been a kind and gentle mate, and was accustomed to tell Jane how much she resembled her mother. “Well, Johnny,” said the colonel, after a pause, “I am a reasonable man, only a little too easy tempered. 3* Now, you puppy, listen to me, and don't dare to turn even the corner of your eye on that girl until I have done. You know, John, I am rich and you are poor, and that I shall be ten times richer when I have finished my canal and other great improvements—you young rascal, I see you peeping! I say, when I have finished my canal and other improvements, I shall be as rich as old Fred Phillips before his property was all confiscated.” “That will be some time after the last trumpet sounds,” quoth Master John. “What's that you are mumbling, you puppy?” “Something about a trumpet, sir.” “Well, as I was saying, John, I am rich. I don't wish to hurt your feelings, but you are what I should call, as it were, comparatively a beggar.” “Beggar!” cried John, indignantly. “Do you think that with arms like mine, and a heart to use them, a man can be called a beggar? Sir, I shall never beg anything of you but your daughter.” “Be quiet—confound that red-pepper temper of yours; I wonder Jane ever ventures to come near you. As I was saying, Jane will have a fine time with you—you're always taking people up before they are down. I tell you I don't mean the least offence, and yet you will fly out upon me. But as I was saying, your grandfather is a beggar, without a shilling to help himself with; your father is a beggar, and will be as long as continental money lasts; you are a beggar, and your children's children, to the fourteenth generation, for aught appears to the contrary, will be beggars, if you marry without my consent. I'll disinherit Jane, by the Lord Harry! Do you hear me, John?” “I do, sir. I have listened with the deepest attention, and, if you wish it, will answer you.” “Go on—let me hear some of your school logic, you blockhead.” “This is my answer, colonel. You say you are rich, and so you are. But by what tenure do you hold your wealth? Every day and every night, you are exposed to the inroads of a set of unprincipled plunderers, sparing neither friend or foe. Before to-morrow morning, your fields may be laid waste, your cattle driven away, your barns and house set on fire, and your life, as well as that of your daughter and your dependants, sacrificed without mercy. If you escape these midnight ruffians, it rests alone with such men as my father is, and I intend to be, to save you from being hanged as a traitor, and your property becoming the spoil of some recreant tory. Will you boast of possessions you hold by such a flimsy tenure as this? Let me tell you, Colonel Hammond, that in times like these, the man who possesses the hand and the heart to defend his native land, is of more worth than hoarded wealth, rich harvest-fields, herds of defenceless sheep and cows, or a splendid palace, which he cannot defend himself, and must rely on poor beggars, like me, to protect from violation. Sir, I am a man— and men are worth their weight in gold when an enemy is lording it over the land, and only brave hearts and determined hands can expel him. I own my family is become poor, but we are not beggars, for we have land, and the power to make it productive.” There was so much truth, urged with such a manly spirit, in this harangue, that the colonel was deeply affected by the picture thus presented to his contemplation. He fell into a train of brief reflection, at the end of which, he said with frank good-humour— “Well, John, on one condition, I give my consent.” “Name it sir—shall I eat fire?” “Eat a bull-frog, you blockhead, as the Frenchmen used to do at old Ti—at least, so the English said—as I observed before, John, you have neither money, rank or reputation, except just among the girls and boys of the neighbourhood. The husband of the only daughter of Colonel Hammond, an old continental officer, with money in his pocket, and lands at his back, ought to be somebody. Now, John, you say you are going to fight for your country, that makes every man a gentleman. Go and offer yourself to Washington, and do something to merit an honourable place in history, and Thunder and Mars! my daughter, my money, my lands and improvements, shall be yours. What say you, you puppy?” “I say, colonel, your hand to the bargain. If I don't stake life, limb and liberty—heart and soul on this game, call me not only beggar, but coward, if you will. Your word and your hand, Colonel Hammond.” “There—take it if you dare. Come to me with the voice of your country in your favour, and the approbation of the great Washington, and by the Lord Harry, if I had a dozen girls, you should marry them all— shouldn't he, Jane?” “Not with my consent, father. I would forbid the bans.” “What, hey!—you'd have him all to yourself, would you?” “Even so, sir. I shall give all, and expect all in return.” “Quite a reasonable young woman,” said the colonel. “But come, John, there is no time to be lost; the fate of our country hangs by a hair, and she wants every true heart, every strong arm, to sustain her. Lose not a day. Life is short, my boy, and the hours of a soldier are numbered.” “Too true,” answered Jane; “and his will be briefer than the common lot, I fear. Father, you have put him on the track of death,” and the tears gushed from her eyes. “Track of a fiddlestick! Why, girl, I once had six and thirty muskets pointed at me at once, and they all missed fire, owing to the dampness of the priming. They hissed, and fizzled, and funked like fury, but I escaped as it were by a miracle. If they had all gone off, you might have converted my skin into a cullender. Never fear, Jane—never fear; a man can't die but once, and then not before his time comes. Think of the muffled drum—the funeral march to the tune of Roslin Castle; the long lines of soldiers, with their arms reversed—their eyes bent on the ground—the minute guns at a distance—the cocked hat and sword on the coffin, and the six rounds fired over the grave of the gallant soldier. Thunder and Mars! but it's a glorious thing to die for our country.” “Glorious to him, but death to those that love him,” sighed poor Jane. “Now, John, go and prepare yourself, and don't let me see that face of yours again till you have fulfilled your part of the contract, and won the good word of Washington. I served with him in Braddock's war, and dare say, he will recollect me. But once more away, boy, and remember while you are doing your duty to your country, you are at the same time winning your way to the arms of love and beauty. Is'nt she a jewel—a rose-bud—John.” “To my eye the fairest, to my heart the dearest of all created beings, sir. But, I must leave you now. I have an engagement to go out on a sky-larking party to-night, with some of our lads. We mean to scour the country as far as Kingsbridge. Perhaps we may pick up some straggler, or gather some information that may be useful at head quarters.” “Right, John, I wish this timber leg of mine would let me go with you, as my experience might be useful. But, John, don't forget that this reasonable young lady must have all or nothing. None of your sparking, by the way—hey!” “Let this be my answer, sir,” saying which, he approached Jane, and folding her in his arms, gave her a farewell kiss.” “Why, Thunder and Mars!” exclaimed the old continental; “what do you mean, you puppy? you are reckoning your chickens before they are hatched. What! before my face—how dare you presume, sir. If the young rascal had not done it, I'd have kicked him.” added the colonel, aside. “Despair and hope, are no cowards, sir. One fears nothing, the other expects every thing. If I return, as I trust I shall with credit, you will forgive this freedom; if I return no more, let the offences of the dead rest in the grave. Once more, farewell, my dearest Jane.” “I cannot say what I wish,” sobbed Jane. “But, oh! do not forget that in your resolution to gain me, you may lose yourself.” “Not another word—ah! that confounded twinge! I knew I should be the worse for standing in the damp here. Enough said, you young fools. John, an old continental gives you his blessing, and here's my hand, boy, that I will keep my word; see that you keep yours. Good bye, my lad,”—and the colonel led his sorrowing daughter home. John watched till they were lost in the shadows of evening, and then burst into an extempore of love and enthusiasm, as was his custom, from having no one to talk with the greater portion of his time. “Now,” cried he, “now my good heart, and good right hand, be true as steel this once. And you, my twin darlings, equally dear, liberty and my Jane, inspire me. If I halt or falter, or turn my back, may my country disown, and my mistress desert me!” These, and such like animating thoughts occupied his mind, as he hastened towards home to fit himself for the night adventure. His step assumed new firmness; his heart swelled with a bright train of anticipation, and his character at once became strengthened and exalted by the inspiring influence of a fixed and noble purpose. He was now a man and a hero. Returning to the old stone-house, he quietly procured his equipments, without disturbing the old couple, who, with their little handmaid, went to roost with the fowls, and rose with the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A SKY-LARKING. The rendezvous of the sky-larking party, was at a house standing apart from the post road, in a retired valley, commonly called Hungry Hollow, and sometimes Hard Scramble Hole, a name aptly indicative of the place and its inhabitants. In almost every district of country, and every town, of any considerable magnitude, there will be found some peculiar spot, where the idle, the dissipated and the worthless, as it were instinctively, or by some irresistible sympathy, congregate together, to prey upon the neighbourhood and each other. This was the case with Hungry Hollow, into whose sheltering bosom had crept some dozen families of children of the night, who, as was said of them, slept while others worked, and worked while others slept. All day, they might be found lounging in bed, or sunning themselves in summer, and in winter crouching in the chimney corner, by a fire of such decayed wood as they could procure without the labour of cutting down trees. But to make up for thus killing time in the day, report said that they laboured hard at night, when, like animals of prey, they sallied forth to the infinite annoyance of the surrounding country, committing various petty depredations, 4 hardly aspiring to the dignity of crimes. Whether they deserved all that was said of them, is doubtful. But, certain it is, they had a bad name, which is enough to bring both dog and man into perpetual trouble. Hungry Hollow, was, moreover, infamous for its ghosts, goblins, and all the dire array of rural superstition, partly, in all probability, from its situation, and partly from a disposition in the occupants to discourage interlopers from coming among them, to spy out the nakedness of the land. It was a lonely place, and solitude is the nurse of terror. A ruined church, with broken windows, decayed doors, without hinges, weather-beaten sides, and moss-grown roof, stood nodding to its fall, in the midst of a few old gray-beard hemlocks, under whose melancholy shade was the burial place, designated here and there by a rough unsculptured stone, most ingenously diverging from the perpendicular. Not one of these bore letter or epitaph; for, such was the character of most of those buried in this unconsecrated spot, that Zoroaster Fisk, the stone-cutter, could never bring himself to prostitute his muse to the celebration of their virtues. We mention this, as a fact honourable to his integrity, and deserving the imitation of all those whose vocation it is to immortalize the dead. A lie on a tomb-stone, is the worst of lies. It endures for a century, and furnishes perpetual encouragement to rogues, by affording ocular demonstration that he who has lived a life of worthlessness and crime, may yet leave behind him a good name. The grave, and those who speak in its name, should tell nothing but the honest truth, or else be silent. The upper extremity of Hungry Hollow, that is, the part most distant from the high road, was especially infested with the airy creations of fear and fancy, and avoided by all honest people. Once in a great while, you might persuade a couple of strapping country lads, of the strongest nerves, to venture through it by night, but then you may be sure they always carried a great piece of fox-fire, to light them on their way, and, instead of talking, sung or whistled with all their might, “my name was Captain Kyd,” or “in Scarlet Town, where I was born,” or some other equally inspiring ditty, to keep up their courage. It was indeed a gloomy vale, through which a lazy brook, of dark brown water, meandered silent and slow. Shaded with tangled foliage, and bordered beyond by precipices of mouldering rocks, that seemed to have got the start of the rest of the world, in the race of swift decay. A score of awful legends, which we may one day collect for the edification of this story-loving age, were about the only product of this barren spot, where neither squirrel, fox, weazel, or pole-cat, was ever known to abide. No cricket, it was said, ever chirped there; no honey-bee ever gathered its tribute from the coarse, unfragrant flowers; nor did the capricious butterfly, in all its vagrant excursions, ever tarry a moment there. At that time, the interior of this valley was as little known, as that of New Holland or Japan. The house where our sky-larkers were to meet, being just at the entrance of Hungry Hollow, was presumed to be out of the sphere of diabolical influence. It was erewhile the abode of one Case—or Cornelius Boshin, who, some few years before, had decamped, no one knew whither, with some half a dozen strapping night-walkers, leaving only his wife and youngest boy in possession of the premises. The widow, as she called herself, and the son, now full grown, lived after the manner of their forefathers; young Case, being religiously brought up to “nothing,” according to country phrase, and his mother still despising labour, from the bottom of her heart. Tradition has preserved an anecdote, highly illustrative of their character. A neighbour, passing one day, and seeing Mrs. Boshin sitting in all her glory, sunning herself under an old tottering piazza, shaped like a cocked hat, cried out, “well widow, as usual, nothing to do, I see.” To which she replied—“no, the Lord be praised, we have nothing to eat, and no fire to cook it with.” On another occasion, a strnager had been driven to take shelter there for the night, and rising early in the morning, indulged in a ramble about the house before breakfast. On his return, he took the liberty of expressing his wonder how people could live in such a place as Hungry Hollow. “Why,” replied the widow, “when we have nothing else to live on, we live upon each other—and when we can't live upon each other, we live on strangers, like you.” To make good her words, she charged a hundred dollars, continental money, for his night's lodging and breakfast. Events hereafter to be detailed, render it proper to state, that John had once given young Case a most exemplary drubbing, for affirming that Jane Hammond was no beauty, and the old continental a tory. Case never forgave him. The path which led from Hungry Hollow, towards the south, passed down a long sloping descent to the high road, which here ran close to the Hudson. The retired situation of the house, rendered it a safe place for the party to arrange their operations, and there was a high peaked hill close by, which commanded the country round, a distance of several miles. By the time it grew dark, a party of some eight or ten, all belonging to the neighbourhood, and all well known to each other, was collected, waiting the arrival of John. There was Brom Vanderlip, who had once outrun a party of Yagers, though they were mounted, and he on foot. There was Barnabas Pudney, of Buttermilk Hill, who had been a prisoner in the old sugar-house, Liberty-street, now so called, whence he escaped, by becoming so thin, through a process, well understood by old Cunningham, the provost, that as he affirmed, he had escaped through a rat hole. There was Billy Sniffen, who could find his way, blindfold, as he often boasted, from Peekskill to Kingsbridge. There was Ira Root, commonly called Bitter Root, from being somewhat quick on the trigger. There was a tough gray headed farmer, whose nickname was Nighthawk, which originated from a famous exploit performed during a dark night against a band of Skinners. And lastly, there was Zoroaster Fisk, A. M., a composer and cutter of inscriptions, and various affecting devices, with which the pride or affection of the living loves to decorate the memorials of the dead. He excelled all men of his time, in Dutch cherubs, with narrow foreheads and chubby cheeks; his weeping willows often brought tears to the eyes of sentimental explorers of 4* church yards; and for an urn, or a monumental pillar, he was reckoned inimitable. It was credibly, moreover, reported by his surviving cotemporaries, that he composed epitaphs in prose and rhyme, one of which is still extant in the burial ground of the little church erected by the ancient family of the Phillipses, and reads as follows: “Here lies John Williams, here lies he; Hallelujah, Hallelujee.” We are aware that this has been claimed as the joint production of the mayor and corporation of some city, whose name we have forgotten, but there is positive evidence that it belongs to our friend, Zoroaster. But, alas! what now availed his skill in Dutch cherubs, weeping willows, urns and pillars, or monumental inscriptions! Othello's occupation was gone. At the time of which we are speaking, people died or were killed by the red coats, the Yagers, the Tories, the Skinners and the Cow Boys, but it was lucky if they found a grave, much less an epitaph. Others of lesser name and note, completed the party which had thus volunteered to serve their country without the prospect of fame or reward. There were many, very many such men in these times; and it is to the sentiment by which they were inspired, that all succeeding generations will be indebted for the freedom they enjoy. The armies of the United States would have little availed in the struggle, had the yeomanry been disaffected. These rustic adventurers had neither commander, nor any distinctions of rank other than personal qualities; each man fought his own fight, and was his own master on all ordinary occasions; but in times of great peril, instinct pointed out a leader, and the master spirit was always found to be the man. The party was anxiously waiting for John, whose long interview with the old continental, had delayed him somewhat beyond the hour appointed. “What can have become of John?” at length exclaimed Billy Sniffen; “he is not commonly always Jack-come-last.” “Why,” replied, Barnabas Pudney, who spoke most particularly through his nose, and with great deliberation: “Why, I rather calculate I saw him just about sundown—or it might be—yes, I calculate it might be, if I don't mistake, somewhere thereabouts, more or less—I wont be quite positive, though, but I believe—I rather calculate it might have been him.” “Barnabas, my son,” quoth old Nighthawk, with much gravity, “where did you larn to talk? I reckon it must have been of a snail, for you speak for all the world as if you were on a snail's gallop. You should never go for a soldier, for you'd have your head cut off before you could cry quarter.” “No—no,” said Brom Vanderlip, “his speech came with a dead march, or a slow-match; I don't know which. He was seven years old before he could say mammy.” “I'll swear he must have larned of a conch shell,” cried Joe Satchell. “Pooh!” rejoined Dick Widgery, “he would out-talk a rifle bullet, if he could only git his words to come out of his mouth stead of his nose. It's got such a darnation way to go round, its a great while a coming.” Barnabas cut short the joke, by offering to wager a drink, that he could repeat the first lines of the declaration of independence in less time than any man in company. The wager was taken, and Barnabas distanced, the first round, amid a shower of dry jokes. Accordingly, Mrs. or Miss Boshin, as they called her—was roused from her usual inactivity, to give an account of the contents of her cellar, which proved to be nothing but the remains of a barrel of hard cider, a liquor since become classical. It was first handed to old Nighthawk, who tasted it, smacked his lips, and pronounced it emphatically, “man's cider, real red streak.” “Come—come,” exclaimed Barnabas—“no preaching over your liquor, daddy—pass round the mug, will you?” Barnabas took a pull, whereupon his eyes nearly started out of his head, and the liquor spirted out of his nostrils incontinently. “Red streak!” cried he—“I swan, a feller might jist as well try to swallow a sword with two edges It must be real crab-apple, it bites so. Is this the best youv'e got, Miss Boshin?” “The very best—I bought it of old Squire Day, and gin him two hundred continental dollars for it. But the money is not worth much more than half what it was then, and that's some little comfort for being cheated.” “Consarn continental money,” rejoined Barnabas: “Its going down hill like a run-away wagon, and the farther it goes the faster it runs. I don't believe Nighthawk could have overtaken it the time he ran away from the Yagers. “You got ahead of me, for all that, though,” replied the other; “and as for Brom Vanderlip, he ran me out of sight in less than no time.” “I'll swear pine blank to that,” quoth Bitter Root— “I'll bet ten to one on Brom when the Yagers are behind, stead of before. He's jist like your full-blooded colt, that always wins the race if she can only once git ahead. “Well, well,” replied Brom, “see who goes ahead tonight. If I don't put my nose in the enemy's lines before the cock crows, you may tell me on't when I'm dead, that's all.” “You'll never get your nose anywhere but where it is now, right in the middle of your face, only a little on one side;” which joke, though on the whole rather an indifferent one, turned the tide against Brom, who was fated to endure a tempest of horse-laughter, reinforced by half a dozen curs without, who began barking furiously. The merriment of the party ceased in a moment, for in these times the barking of the watch-dogs was too often the signal of plunder, outrage, and murder. Each man seized his gun, and stood on the defensive with grim and silent determination, for they were inured to dangers, and feared nothing but ghosts and hobgoblins. After a pause of a few moments, footsteps were heard approaching; the barking of the dogs gradually lapsed into a growl of doubtful recognition, and the latch was slowly lifted. The door had, however, been fastened inside, and the attempt was followed up by a loud, quick knocking with the butt end of a gun. “Who are you?” cried old Nighthawk. “I'll tell you directly, if you don't open the door,” answered a hoarse voice with a foreign accent. “It's the bloody infernal Yagers,” whispered old Nighthawk. “Now, my boys, stand to your arms. Let them break in, if they dare, and I'll be blamed if we don't give them a grist.” All followed his directions, and an anxious pause ensued, during which, the landlady, who was not unused to such scenes, occupied herself very deliberately in hiding a paper of pins, a few pewter spoons, and other valuables, under a loose plank of the floor. The knocking now became louder, and the rough demand for entrance was repeated more vociferously in broken English. Whereupon, little Barnabas Pudney, who came originally from down east, and was what is called “a curious cretur,” crept slily to a front window, through a crack in the shutters of which he saw, by the light of the stars, something which caused him to burst into a laugh exceedingly sonorous and exhilarating. “I'm a nigger,” cried he, “if it an't John.” The whole party within set up a great shout, with the exception of old Nighthawk, who, on opening the door, welcomed him as follows: “I'll tell you what, youngster, you'd best take keer how you play these tricks upon travellers in these times. A little more of your fun, and you'd have bin a dead man, laughing on the wrong side of your mouth. This is no time for playing Yager. Blame me if I wa'nt going to set old Maple-Sugar on trigger,” so he called his old musket, the stock of which was of maple; “you played the Yager pretty well, and had like to have got a Yager's bitters. It's all wrong, Johnny, my son.” “I know it,” replied John, but I wanted to try your spunk.” “Spunk! hasn't it been pretty well tried already?” said the other. “Only hear how the young chicken crows,” said Bitter Root; “I'll bet a gallon of Miss Boshin's red streak, his sneakers are up as high as the top of the big white-wood-tree before the cock crows to-morrow morning.” “You will—will you?” retorted John, and his eye kindled. But he thought of the necessity of preserving good-fellowship, and contented himself with adding—“The proof of game, is when the gaff sticks— we shall see who cackles first.” The party being now complete, sallied forth about the hour of ten of a still, starry night, at which time all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, except the watchful wights of Hungry Hollow, had gone to rest. Their course led them past the old grave-yard of the decayed church we have noted, and as they drew nigh, they might be seen to close their ranks and huddle together, each essaying to get on the outer side. “I wish you wouldn't push a fellow so,” said Billy Sniffen to Zoroaster Fisk, in an impatient whisper, as Zoe pushed him against a rock by the roadside. At any other time, there would have been some joking at the expense of the stone-cutter, but now the scene, and the impressions to which it gave rise, impressed on all the silence of superstitious awe. In the dim twilight of the starry night, they could distinguish the rustic tomb-stones, and rough-hewn slabs of mouldering wood, which told their errand there without the aid of epitaphs, and the sight cowed the vivacity of the gallant sky-larkers, who, though they had often looked death in the face, were sorely afraid of dead men, and especially their ghosts. “W—w—w—at in the name of goody gracious, is that there?” suddenly exclaimed Barnabas Pudney. “What—where?” answered half a dozen voices. “There! just there, by the old church—don't you see something as white as a sheet, standing, as I calculate, right on the very spot where Sampson Mussey, who was killed by the Skinners, is intarred?” and thereupon Barnabas blew his nose with a sonorous twang, in the true conch-shell style, which signal was answered by a white cow standing right on the spot where Sampson Mussey was interred. This discovery drew a laugh upon Barnabas, and was followed by a dispute about who was most frightened. It served to raise the spirits of the party, by relieving them from some exceeding solemn impressions which such scenes are eminently calculated to inspire, and they gaily pursued their way towards Kingsbridge, bantering Barnabas about his ghost. The night was still as death. No lights burnt in the desolate, abandoned houses, that here and there dotted the scene, and the surface of the expanding river, which here presented all the features of lake scenery, was as smooth as a glassy mirror reflecting all the glories of the skies above. No vessel lay at anchor, or floated lazily along with the tide, on the surface of the melancholy wave: not a sail whitened the dead, monotonous scene, and life and all the business of life seemed to have reached a pause that looked like extinction itself. The lofty outlines of the opposite shore, waned beneath the twinkling sentinels of night, but their sides were clothed in deep obscurity. The peaceful Dutchmen were fast asleep, for they could sleep in peace, since the broad river interposed between them and their enemies, who were carrying their devastations in other directions. Our sky-larkers passed on briskly, without pausing to admire the sober, solemn beauties of the scene, for they had other thoughts in their heads, and other purposes in their hearts. Anon they came opposite to those glorious walls, bordering the western margin of the river, and presenting an everlasting barrier to its expansion. At this moment, a bright light shot athwart the clear expanse of the heavens, and startled the night-adventurers, who halted to ascertain whence it proceeded. They saw the entire firmament towards the north streaked with sheets of living fire, that leaped up, and danced among the winking stars, which seemed to grow pale at their superior brilliancy. It could not be the lightning, for there was not a cloud in the sky. It was an awful sight, and the whole party stood gazing in something more than silent wonder. Ever and anon streams and rolling waves of living light flashed across the starry vault of heaven, succeeded by the gambols of what are called the Merry Dancers, flourishing and skirring about in a thousand fantastic vagaries, and with a speed as swift as thought or fancy. For a while, the earth shone as if at noon-day, 5 or rather beneath the silver radiance of the moon; but by degrees a rich and ruddy pink, succeeded by a deep crimson hue, stole over the sky, tinging the heavens and the earth with a rosy tint, which, however rich and beautiful, smote the hearts of all but John with awful apprehensions. They began to fancy they could detect, in this fantastic frolic of the spheres, various forms of terror and dismay flitting about among the stars; and embodied in their affrighted imagination a scene somewhat allied to the state of the country, as well as the dangers by which they were surrounded. They distinguished through the mists of fearful visions, armies fighting in the air; steeds encountering with resistless fury; columns of soldiers, in red coats, charging like lightning athwart the fiery heavens; and fancied all the dread array of bloody war raging among the stars and planets, as though the host of heaven were engaged in hot contention disputing the empire of the upper world. “The Highlands must be on fire!” said old Nighthawk, at length recovering his speech. “The sky is in a blaze,” muttered Barnabas Pudney. “The world is coming to an end!” exclaimed Billy Sniffen. “It is a token and a warning,” rejoined Zoroaster Fisk, solemnly. “Pooh!” said John, “it is only the aurora borealis.” “The what?” cried all at once. “The light in the north.” “You may call it what you will,” responded Zoroaster, “but I say it is a token and a warning.” “Pooh!” quoth Bitter Root, “he begins to smell Spuyten Duyvel.” “I reckon it's a worse devil than that. It's jist for all the world what granny seen the year before the war, when the sky all turned to blood, one night, and armies were seen fighting, helter-skelter, some in red coats and some in blue.” “Which beat, Zoe?” asked John, jeeringly. “I tell you it's no laughing matter, Johnny. I seed— no, granny did—more than a hundred thousand men, cutting and slashing at one another in the sky in a most awful manner, till it all run with blood. You could see the smoke of the great guns, and some people conceited they could smell gunpowder. After the battle was over, a voice cried out from the clouds— `War, bloody war!' and then—” “Did you see all this, yourself?” “No, but granny did, for she has often told me so, and she was as pious a woman as any man's mother, for that matter. So I'm for going right straight hum agin, for it stands to reason it's a token and a warning. It's flying in the face of Scripture to go down to Kingsbridge agin such a sky as that. There! there! I swear—I mean, I swan—I'm a nigger if I don't think I seed some letters there, as plain as on a head-stone. There's a great W, as long as from here to New York.” “Zoe, did you ever hear of the old cow on Long Island, that told the woman who was milking her, we should have war soon?” “Yes, granny told me that, too, and how an old hen laid an egg, with W—A—R on the shell, in capital letters three inches long.” “It must have been a goose-egg, Zoe,” said John. “But come, boys, this is wasting precious time. The light in the north has no more to do with what we are about, than the light of the stars. You that are frightened, may run home if you please, but I am for going on let who will follow.” So saying, he dashed forward in a quick step, and the whole party, not excepting Zoroaster Fisk, followed, ever and anon looking back over their shoulders to see how matters were going on in the sky. By degrees, the leaping columns of light grew dimmer and dimmer; the bloody tints faded away; the sky assumed its ethereal hue; and the stars twinkled their sleepy lustre alone in the heavens, leaving the party of sky-larkers to pursue their way by their glimmering light. They were now ascending the high hills which command a view of both the Hudson and East rivers, and on arriving at the summit, halted to reconnoitre the country round, as far as the obscurity of night would permit. “Look there! another Rory Bolus!” exclaimed Billy Sniffen, pointing to a great light towards the east. “No, no,” rejoined old Nighthawk, “that's another guess sort of a light than what we saw just now. It's a house or barn a-fire, I reckon.” “Then the red coats, or the Yagers, or tories, or some of the rascally Skinners are out to-night,” said John. “Now, boys, is the time to do something for liberty. Let us make for the spot. It is not far off, and I know the house. It is poor old Ira Tebow's, if I'm not mistaken. Come, follow on; follow on, boys, and be still as mice, for ten to one we meet the rascals on the way.” “I told you something would happen; but howsomever, here goes. I'm for one of you,” cried Zoroaster. They now proceeded forward briskly, and in dead silence, or only communed in whispers. There was no occasion for a commander, or word of command; each was expert in this mode of partisan warfare, and all were left to their own discretion and experience. A walk of some half an hour brought them to the brow of a lesser hill, overlooking the little vale of Sawmill river, which gave them full view of the light proceeding from a barn, now nearly consumed to ashes. The house was beyond the reach of conflagration, being at some distance, and was built of red-stone, such as is found on the western shore of Tappan bay. They saw a light through the window, paused to consult as to their best course of action, and the conversation ended in deciding to dispatch one of the party to reconnoitre the ground. John volunteered his services, and his offer was accepted. With the cautious silence of a cat, he approached, and the first objects he descried were six or eight horses tied to a fence in front of the house, which indicated the number of visiters within. Having ascertained that no one was on the watch without, he crept softly to the window, and peeping in, a scene was disclosed that set his blood on fire. A party of Yagers were carousing at a table on the plunder of the peaceable old man, who, with his gray-haired wife, sat looking 5* on in the silent acquiescence of despair, while two grown up daughters were waiting on the plunderers, now half-drunk with cider. One of them, at length, on a sudden rose from the table, and seizing the elder of the girls about the waist, rudely kissed her pallid cheek, which in an instant reddened with the indignant flush of maiden modesty. The old couple groaned, and John ground his teeth and grasped his sword, as the girl, outraged by still more unmanly indecorums, no longer able to repress her feelings, pushed the ruffian from her with such good-will, that he fell against the table, overset it, and extinguished the lights. A torrent of imprecations, in a foreign tongue, now broke forth from the insolent intruders; they started up, and groping about for their swords, threatened murder in every breath, while the weak voices of the aged couple were heard begging for mercy amid the furious uproar. John could bear it no longer. All thought of his comrades, himself, or his danger, evaporated in a moment, in the heat of his rage, and leaping through the window, in an instant he was cutting and slashing among the ruffian crew. There was no danger of hitting a friend, for the occupants of the house would no doubt flee, and all the rest were fair game. Though alone, the advantage was on his side, for he was armed; while the Yagers, having laid aside their swords, were groping about for them in the dark, sputtering unintelligible imprecations. The party of sky-larkers, who began to wonder what had become of John, now distinguished the uproar of voices, accompanied by the clashing of swords, mingled with groans and imprecations, as the invisible enemy smote one after another the stupified plunderers, now rushed forward to the scene of action. Here they discovered two of the Yagers just on the point of mounting their horses, but horse they never mounted more. They were cloven down without mercy, for they deserved none. They warred against the helplessness of age, the innocence of youth, the property of men, the chastity of women, and could claim none of the courtesies of honourable warfare. This done, they made their way into the house, where old Nighthawk ran plump against John, who was still seeking his enemies, and made a blow at him which cut a deep gash in the door-post. “What the d—I are you hacking at?” exclaimed the old man, “don't you see it's me?” “See! How the plague should I? It's as dark as pitch, and besides, my eyes are filled with blood. But I think I have done for the rascals, for I could find no more enemies.” “And so you fell foul of a friend?” replied the other. “But let us get a light and see how the land lies. Here, Billy Sniffen, run to the barn and bring us a Yager candle.” Billy returned in a minute or two with a burning brand, the candles were found, and the whole scene disclosed to view. On the floor, floating in their recreant blood, lay five lusty fellows, in whiskers, three with their heads split open, and two only disabled with their wounds. These, Bitter Root insinuated, had better be put out of their misery, as he expressed it; but John claimed them as his prisoners, and insisted their lives should be spared, though they richly deserved hanging. It was now proposed to search for the poor fugitives, who had been driven from their home by the lawless brutality of these hireling ruffians, and accordingly the party dispersed around, calling upon them in friendly tones, and inviting their return. They heard with fearful tremblings, but at length distinguishing their native tongue in its native accent, ventured cautiously to obey the summons, and being told what had happened, expressed their gratitude in homely phrase, but heartfelt language. “I wish,” said John, “some one would tie a handkerchief over my forehead, for this blood almost blinds me.” “You are wounded!”—exclaimed the pretty girl, whose lips had been profaned by the brutal soldier, and with trembling steps sought her Sunday silk handkerchief, which, with hasty hands, she bound over his wound. John was a fine, manly looking fellow, with deep blue eyes, and dark brown hair curling about his ears; and the daughter of old Ira Tebow often in her solitary rambles recalled to mind the bloody brow, and thankful look of the deliverer of herself and parents, while her gratitude sometimes partook of a softer feeling. After demolishing the remainder of the feast of the barbarous Cyclops, a consultation took place as to their future proceedings, and it was unanimously agreed that it was now too late to procced on their original destination, since a couple of hours would bring the dawn. They decided, therefore, to bury the dead, mount their horses, and carry the two wounded caitiffs to the quarters of Colonel Courtlandt, who commanded the nearest post, and under whose authority they acted. Accordingly, their bodies were borne forth in silence, and buried in one grave, without coffin, shroud, funeral prayer, or dirge; save that of a screech-owl, which, attracted by the light of the burning barn, sat on a neighbouring tree quavering their parting knell. No memorial marks the spot, for they deserved none at the hands of those they had come so far to molest; and there they rested, in common with thousands of more deserving victims to the hopeless attempt to subjugate a nation of freemen. Their horses and military equipments were lawful spoil of war, and divided among the sky-larkers. A few guineas found in their pockets, were given to the old man to pay for their supper. “God forever bless you, my son,” said old Ira Tebow to John, at parting. “Let us give one hurrah for liberty. I can't fight, but my heart is for the good cause.” And the silent night was startled by a shout that echoed far and wide, to liberty. “You have paid dear for it to-night,” said John, “and I fear have yet much to pay.” “Well, may be so, my son. But all will come right at last. I may not live to see it, but my children, and their children's children, will reap the harvest of the seed of fire and blood, sown here this night. So long as we have God and Washington on our side, none but cowards will despair of our cause. That our country is destined to be free and independent, I am as sure as that I am alive at this moment, and in that belief I shall die contented. God bless you, my son, may your good old grandfather and grandmother, whom I know, escape the wrongs of me and mine.” Each man now mounted one of the good horses of the conquered foe, and there being one to spare, it was bestowed on the old man, with strict injunctions to sell it, as soon as possible, somewhere out of the neighbourhood, least it might be hereafter recognised. “But what shall I do with your handkerchief, when my wound is done bleeding?” said John, to the pretty daughter, who stood looking out at the window. “Keep it to remember me by,” answered she, with a blush, and a smile of touching sadness. And he did keep it, in spite of the affected poutings of Jane Hammond, who took, on all occasions, in and out of season, to criticise both the texture and the pattern. The party then pursued their way homewards, first stopping at the quarters of Colonel Courtlandt, where they delivered up the two prisoners, and gave an account of their expedition. After receiving the praises of the colonel, they separated, each for his proper destination. John lingered behind a few moments, to ask the brave colonel for a testimonial of his good conduct, which he gave with all his heart; complimenting him, at the same time, on his gallantry, and assuring him of his future friendship. He then spurred on his steed towards the old stone house, it being yet too early in the morning to pay his respects to Colonel Hammond. And thus ended the pleasant sky-larking of the venturesome boys of Westchester, who, in old times, were the theme of more than one rustic ballad, now forgotten.</field>

A TOUCH AT A PICTURE—THE AUTHOR SHOWS HIMSELF A HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE—JOHN SUSPECTED OF STEALING A HORSE—SILLY BEHAVIOUR OF JANE—THE OLD CONTINENTAL FLASHES A SPARK OF MAGNANIMITY, BUT IT GOES OUT WITHOUT PRODUCING A FLAME— A LONG WALK, AND A LONG TALK, WHICH IT IS BELIEVED WILL RESTORE JANE TO THE GOOD GRACES OF THE READER —TOGETHER WITH A VAST DEAL OF OTHER ENTERTAINING AVD INSTRUCTIVE MATTERS. If a heroine is worth anything, she is worth a description; and it just now occurs to us that we have not as yet intimated even the colour of Jane Hammond's eyes, for which omission we beg pardon of that fair young maiden, and all our readers. After the departure of John, she returned home with her father, filled with sad forebodings. The colonel lighted his pipe, and, soothed by that unequalled teacher of philosophy, fell into a glorious reverie, in which he conceived the abstract idea of a great improvement in ploughshares. The daughter also fell into a reverie, but it was not about ploughshares. She sat so perfectly still, in such a careless, yet becoming attitude, that we shall take the opportunity to sketch her likeness. Her seat was at the low window of an old fashioned house, built by the colonel's father, of whom, were we inclined to make the most of a small capital of invention, we could say enough to tire the patience of any reasonable reader. We might, moreover, fill up a page or two with a description of the house, together with the chairs, tables, chests of drawers, andirons, bedding, and bedposts; but will spare our readers for the present, promising them faithfully, that if, in the course of this work, we are hard pushed for something to say, they shall have such an inventory as would suffice for an auctioneer's sale. At present, however, there is metal more attractive before us. The window where Jane sat, looked out on the windings of the little stream through its paradise of green meadows, in the distance of which might be caught a glimpse of the old stone house, with its moss covered roof and rugged chimneys, where now dwelt, in lonely solitude, the aged grandparents of her adventurous lover. A dark spot in the grey obscurity of evening alone indicated its precise position, and fancy supplied the rest. Her arms were crossed on the window-seat, and being somewhat raised, discovered a waist fashioned by nature beyond all the art of the most expert Parisian artiste. Above this taper miricle, one might detect, beneath her folded arms, the swelling graceful outline of a gently heaving bosom, which insinuated, not disclosed, the hidden snows, and gave rise to dim, yet glowing visions of things unseen, the secret shrines of lowly adoration. Her head bent gracefully forward, and somewhat depressed, indicated something like a latent enthusiasm, mingled with hope and apprehension, and this attitude brought the silken tresses of her chestnut hair partly over her forehead and eyes. No one could ever tell the colour of those eyes; for as the tints of a summer landscape are perpetually varying in the shade and sunshine, so did the various emotions of her heart, and the inspirations of her mind, forever vary the seeming colour of her eyes. Whether black, or brown, or gray, remains a question to this day undecided, and those few who remembered her in the days of her youth, often disputed on the subject, without ever agreeing. No one was, however, so disputatious as to question the hue of her long eye-lashes, as everybody agreed they looked for all the world like changeable silk. For the rest, her figure was the exact counterpart of that of the lady the reader most admires, and her features seemed to have come together by accident. But it was one of the happiest accidents in the world; for it produced, somehow or other, a face so irregular, yet so charming, as to distance the happiest conceptions of painting or poetry. Its beauty, or rather its loveliness—for she could not be called beautiful—consisted in that indescribable, inimitable mystery, called expression, and never failed to attract the sympathies of all who knew her, from its various parts to the delightful whole. The face of Jane was, however, composed of legitimate materials; a pair of cherry lips, inlaid with two rows of polished ivory, whence issued the balmy breath of spring; a dimpled cheek that rivalled the aforesaid cherries; a delicate, lady-like nose and chin, and a general contour divested of the slightest traces of commonplace vulgarity. But I forbear to say more, lest, peradventure, I should fall in love 6 with the picture I am drawing. Suffice to say, that her voice, both in speaking and singing, was so soft, so exquisitely musically melancholy, when serious, so inspiring, when gay, that when she spoke or sung, no echoes ever replied, for they all died away in listening. But the less we say of her education and accomplishments, the better, perhaps, for our heroine. She possessed neither piano, harp, or lute, nor could she have played honest men to sleep with them, had they been in her possession. Yet still she possessed the very soul of harmony, and an ear so nice and delicate, that an old German musician once said of her, that had not Apollo got the start of her, she would have certainly become the goddess of music. Tradition says, that she used to sing some old Scottish ballads with such pathos and expression, as often brought iron tears from the eyes of the old continental, who was fond of hearing her of a calm summer evening. One of these, which she used to sing about the time she believed John was a deserter, has been preserved, and ran as follows: Hoot awa frae me, Donald, ye're nae lad for me, Ye're fause in your tongue, lad, and fause in your ee; Hoot awa frae me, Donald, gang far o'er the sea, Ye're fause to your country, and nae true to me. Gang awa, gang awa, lad, and come nae again, To part with thee ever, sae sairly does pain, But to see thee, thou fause one, were ten time more sair Hoot awa frae me, Donald, and meet me nae mair. I will think on thee, Donald, as ane dead and gane, I will weep for thee, Donald, when I'm all alane, I will pray God to shelter thee, lad, frae all harms, For ye'll nae mair find shelter in these blighted arms. Hoot awa frae me, Donald, I'll aye wish ye weel, And when no one kens me, to pray for ye, kneel; But though my heart break, lad, ye'll never mair see The lass who is dying, fause Donald, for thee. The mother of Jane was a clever, sensible woman, and the example of a mother is of more consequence to a daughter, than all the boarding-school discipline in the world. Jane had also occasionally spent some time in the city, before it became the head-quarters of the British army, and her manners, though partaking of rural simplicity, were not altogether rustic. There was nothing vulgar about her, but she was not at all fashionable, nor had she acquired any fashionable accomplishments. But in all that becomes a woman—a gentle and reasonable woman—in all the little arts and acquirements that contribute to the happiness of the domestic fireside, and make women ministering angels, she was by no means wanting. Her mind was pure and simple, her understanding excellent. Nature had done much for her, by bestowing, in great perfection, the faculty of deriving knowledge from everything she saw or heard. All wisdom is not locked up in books. There is wisdom to be derived from the works of the Creator; from exhibitions of human character, the daily routine of human actions; and all that we see in nature or the social state, contributes to awaken the mind and expand the intellect. Imagination, thought, reflection, and comparison, are all rich sources, from whence is derived the nurture of the mind; and thus it not unfrequently happens, that the brightest specimens of genius seem to leap into life full formed, like Minerva from the brain of Jove. They are not so, however. They have studied in the fruitful region of their minds, and, as certain animals are said to do, grown fat on their own nutriment. Those who derive their materials from books, suffer others to think for them; while those who have no other volume to consult, but that of nature and experience, generally decide with a sagacity which often makes the learned stare, and sets philosophy to inventing new theories. Our heroine had been principally educated in this school, and the result will be best tested by the standard of her future conduct. On arriving at home, John found the old farmer hard at work in his garden, and now and then pausing to admire his currant-bushes, which were his choicest favourites; the young handmaid was milking the cows to the tune of Barbara Allen; and the old dame preparing breakfast, which consisted entirely of the products of their own labour. They were all too patriotic to drink tea, even if it could have been procured; and as for coffee and sugar, they had become traditionary in the family. Such was the scarcity of the most ordinary conveniences of life, that, in many places, thorns were substituted for pins by the women of the interior country. Had it not been for Mangham, the pedlar and tinker, who sometimes paid a visit to this quarter, there would have been no stitching for lack of needles. “Well, for the landsake!” exclaimed the little maid, as John rode up on his gallant charger, “where did you get that fine horse?” “Oh! I found a mare's nest with eight fine colts in it, and took this one for my share.” “You be fiddled,” retorted the little maid, “I don't believe a word on't. You've turned Cow Boy, and been robbing some of the poor people down below.” “Ah! John, John!” said the old dame, shaking her head. At the same time, the grandfather coming up, demanded rather harshly, where he got that animal? whether he came honestly by him, or had plundered some poor farmer like himself? and declaring, if such were the case, he should carry him back if it cost him his life. This imputation called out the lad, and he at once vindicated himself by detailing the adventure of the preceding night, drawing the attention of his auditors to the gash in his forehead, which caused the good woman to exclaim—“Thank heaven, it is no worse! You might just as well have been killed as not;” meaning, that the one was just as likely as the other. “And so you won the nag in fair fight, John?” said the old man. “Yes, sir; I paid for him with my blood, and that's better than continental money any day.” “Well, go and turn him out in the long meadow; there is grass up to his eyes.” “Not yet, sir; I must first carry a message to the colonel.” “A message—ah! I reckon you have made a mistake, John. You mean the colonel's daughter.” But John heard him not; he was cantering away towards 6* the portly mansion of the old continental. It was rather an early hour for a visit, but country people don't know the extreme impropriety of disturbing young ladies in their morning dress. Jane, who had passed the first part of the night in thinking, the last, in dreaming, was up betimes in the morning, looking as fresh and blooming as a rose-bud, in spite of her anxieties, for she had a clear conscience, and that is a great consolation in all troubles. She happened, for some mysterious purpose, to be looking towards a certain old stone house, which was, indeed, rather a picturesque object in the gray morning hour, with its sharp, mossy roof, and the blue smoke ascending to the skies, from the rugged chimney, and while thus occupied, saw a horseman ride briskly up the little knoll, dismount at the door, and, after a brief parley, disappear within. The distance was too great to distinguish who it was, in the obscurity of the dawn, and the sight threw her into a trepidation which caused her heart to flutter strangely. It could hardly be John, for he, she knew, had gone forth on foot, and suddenly the thought shot across her mind that it was some messenger of ill news either from John or his father. Gradually, however, as is usual in such cases, all her apprehensions at length centered on the object nearest her heart; and in this painful state she remained, gazing wistfully in that direction, when suddenly she saw the stranger come forth, mount his horse, and dash along the road that ran beside the stream leading to the residence of the old continental. Her throbbing heart whispered that something strange had happened, and she retired from the window into her chamber, afraid of hearing it too soon. Here, in a few minutes, she could distinguish the clattering of horses hoofs, and—she could not help it—her curiosity led her to the window again, where all doubts and fears were at once dispelled by a discovery which we leave to the sagacity of the world. It happened, unluckily for our hero, that at the precise moment of his riding up to the house, the old continental was in a very bad humour, owing to the failure of one of his pet inventions. In going the rounds, as was his daily custom, he discovered that a valuable pup, with a pedigree equal to that of a blood-horse, or a noble lord, standing at the head of the list in the royal calendar, had been caught in one of his infallible mole-traps, whereby one of his legs was so much injured that the poor animal could scarcely drag himself along. The colonel partly consoled himself by calling the puppy a great blockhead, but his afforded him only partial relief, and he continued sorely disturbed in mind. “Thunder and Mars! what brought you here this time in the morning?” asked he, gruffly, of John. “Didn't I tell you not to show your face here again till— But, hey! Why, blood and fire! what have you got that rag tied about your pate for? and how did you come by that fine horse, hey?” “How is my dear Jane, sir?” “What's that to you, puppy? Get out, you stupid cur!” and here the colonel turned upon the wounded dog, who was howling most dolorously, and, lifting up his lame leg, was just on the point of giving him a benediction, when the poor dumb thing gave him such a piteous look, that his heart smote him, and he turned his wrath once more on friend John, exclaiming— “I say, what's that to you, sir? and how dare you call my only daughter your dear Jane? But why don't you answer me? What is the matter with that fool's pate of yours, and where did you get that horse?” “I purchased him in fair fight, and at his full value, sir. He cost me this cut across the forehead.” “What—what—hey! Johnny! Come, dismount, and tell us all about it; but mind, none of your bragging, you young dog.” John dismounted, accordingly, and entered the house, expecting to meet Jane; but that discreet damsel still remained ensconced in her chamber, where, in our opinion, she heard and saw all that was passing below. Our hero was mortified and disappointed at finding the room empty. Nay, he ventured to insinuate to the colonel, that, as he could not afford to tell the story twice over, he should await the appearance of the young lady, who might very naturally feel some little curiosity. The old continental called him a conceited puppy, but finally surrendered, yielded to his desire to hear the adventures of the sky-larkers, and forthwith commanded the attendance of his daughter. She came, clad in all the bloom of a spring morning, adorned in woman's choicest livery— blushes and smiles; she gave her soft hand to John, and returned his pressure with something, which the vanity of the youth interpreted into a contraction of her rosy fingers; something neither passive nor yet active, but which thrilled his heart, and caused him to look down on all creation. “There, now, confound your impudence!” cried the colonel; “give us a full and true account of your last night's frolic. Sit down, Jane, where he can't see you, or the puppy won't know what he is saying.” Jane obeyed, by getting partly behind the open door, whence she ever and anon looked out, like the sun from behind a cloud, and as often as this happened, John forgot what he was saying. As he proceeded, her feelings became deeply interested; and when he came to relate the particulars of the midnight contest, she left her retreat, placed herself close by his side, clasped his hand, and listened, with dewy eyelids, while her bosom swelled with deep emotion. When he had finished, she rose, rapidly quitted the room, and when a few minutes after, she returned, her eyes were inflamed with weeping. She brought a cambric handkerchief, which, we regret to say, was not fringed with Brussels lace, and gently removing that of the daughter of Ira Tebow, bound it about his forehead. It was some time before John could get this handkerchief again; and when, at last, he requested its return, as a keepsake from that poor girl, Jane exclaimed, as she gave it him—“Lord! what a fuss you make about an old bandana handkerchief, John!” “Is all this true, John?” said the colonel, “real matter of fact, like my exploit at old Ti?” “Did I ever tell you a falsehood, colonel?” “No, John, I'll say that for you. You are always impudent enough, to speak out fairly, when you might sometimes better hold your tongue. I believe every word you've said; and now, Thunder and Mars! I'll— faith, I've a great mind—hem—hum—ha—no, not so cheaply as that, either,” quoth the colonel, muttering to himself. “What were you saying, sir?” asked John. “Nothing—at least, nothing that concerns you to hear—that is to say— But, John, what did Colonel Phil say to you when he heard the story?” John handed him the testimonial of that gallant officer, which the colonel read, occasionally exclaiming at intervals, “Good! good!” with particular satisfaction. When he had finished, he returned the paper, and spoke as follows: “Well, John—but, Jane, what the deuce are you doing with papers belonging to other people, hey? But as I was going to say, John, this is a pretty good beginning, but it don't come up to old Ti yet, by a great deal, my boy. However, as I said, it is a pretty good beginning. Six Yagers killed, two wounded prisoners, and a fine horse, all at the expense of a cut over the eye. Dog cheap, John—cheap as dirt—a good beginning, certainly, as I said before, but it must not be the end. Hold your tongue, sir!” “I was not speaking, colonel,” said John, smiling. “Yes—but you were just opening your mouth to speak; and you, young madam, don't be looking at me as if you'd eat me. Young man,” and the old continental drew himself up with ineffable dignity, “this is a mere flea-bite; such things as these happen every day in war-time, and are never recorded in history. You must be in the chronicles, sir. Thunder and Mars! you must place yourself on a par with me, before I give you my daughter, my money, my lands, and improvements. You must get a timber leg, have one arm sliced off, or lose an eye, or you must have a few bullet-holes through you—” “Oh! father!” cried Jane. “Be dumb, madam, and listen to what I am saying. You must figure in broad daylight, and in sight of armies; you must win the gratitude of your country; you must descend to posterity; and, more than all this, you must receive the approbation of the great Washington. When you have done this, all I have shall be yours, and not before, on the honour of an old continental.” Ah! father!” cried Jane, “you will never be satisfied till you send him to his grave. Last night he escaped by miracle. A little more, and that cut would have been fatal. John—dear John!” exclaimed she, passionately, “give me up—I am not worth the price of such a purchase.” “No, dearest Jane! The contract is made, and shall be fulfilled, if heaven spares me life and opportunity. I mean to strive for you and my country, and if I fall, I shall die for love and liberty!” “What a cruel situation is mine!” the tears trickling down her cheeks. “I can only look for happiness through the perpetual risk of losing it forever. But I will not discourage you with my fears. The women, like the men of my country are ready to sacrifice everything to its freedom.” “There spoke the daughter of an old continental,” cried the colonel. “Kiss me, my girl—and you too, John, talk like a brave fellow. Thunder and Mars! I've a great mind to put an end to all this. But no— not yet—not yet. But I tell you what—you may go and take a walk together, if you will promise not to runaway. I give you an hour to say all you have to say, while I go and visit that infernal mole-trap, and mend this ridiculous puppy's leg, who makes more rout, by half, than if he'd lost his head. Away with you—remember, only one hour.” The walk lasted more than an hour. They rambled under the stately elms, and plane trees, that overshadowed the clear murmuring stream, and now began to exhibit the many coloured tints of autumn. The maples and sumach, already displayed their scarlet foliage, most beautiful in decay; the hardy brood of autum nal flowers were on the wane, and the blue-birds, the meadow-larks, and the robins, were collecting in flocks, preparing for the sunny regions of the south. There was a sober, calm serenity, almost bordering on melancholy, in the aspect of the earth and skies; a soothing gentleness in the murmurs of the stream, and the soft whisperings of the dying leaves, which ever and anon, smitten by the frost, fell in spiral eddies to the ground, or dropt into the brook, apt emblems of some dear and well remembered companion, on his way to the home of all the living, the region of eternal suffering or eternal rest. Every object around them was calculated to awaken and foster the purest and tenderest emotions of the heart, and the impression that their parting now, might be to meet no more, imparted a deep solemnity to the feelings by which they were inspired. Love, engrossing, overpowering love, filled all their hearts—prompting a thousand innocent endearments, such as at a time like this, may be claimed without assurance, and granted without indelicacy. The silent solitudes of nature are not the promoters of the guilty passions; it is where the human race herd together in crowds, amid all those luxurious seductions, appealing to the senses and the imagination, through every avenue of the heart, that the passions become epidemical, spreading like contagion from one to another, until the entire mass becomes diseased and corrupted. There is no incitement to sensuality in the charms of nature; no seduction in her music; no mischief in her smiles; no luxurious facination in the rich bounties she pours out with such a lavish hand; and they who would secure to themselves the cheapest, the purest, and the most enduring source of innocent enjoyment, should cherish in their inmost heart a feeling of admiration for that stupendous and beautiful fabric, which more than any other work of his hand, displays the wisdom, the goodness, and the omnipotence of the great Architect of the universe. At length, after rambling a considerable way, their tongues often silent, but their eyes and hearts discoursing in the silent language of mutual love, Jane asked with a hesitation exquisitely feminine, “is it not time to return?” “Not yet, dearest. Remember it may be long before we meet again. I do not wish to work on your apprehensions, or alarm your tenderness, in order to tempt you to exceed your father's permission. But when I go away now, it is with a determination to be absent a long while. I will not deceive you, dearest Jane. 7 I am going to offer my services to Washington; to fight by the side of my father, and if necessary, to die with him in defence of my country. It is only in this way I can make myself worthy of your heart and hand.” “I was going to entreat you to stay with us, but I will not. No, dear John! whatever I may suffer, or whatever may happen to you—you shall go. It must never be said of an American woman, that there lived one who loved herself so well, that she forgot her country in times like these. At least, it shall never be said of me. Are not the peaceful farmers and their sons fighting for liberty, almost without clothing, or food, or shelter of any kind, and with nothing to sustain them but the love of freedom, their confidence in a good cause, and in the wisdom and virtue of Washington? and shall their mothers, wives, and daughters, be wanting to their glorious duty? No, John! no, dear—dearest John! Go—fight and die, if more martyrs are required. You may fall, and be buried no one will know where, without any to tell of your courage and devotion—without any memorial to mark the spot where a nameless man died for his country. But you will live in my heart while I live; and, whatever sorrows may fall to my lot, will be soothed by the pride of having been dear to the heart of one who loved his country better than his mistress. Go—and may heaven protect you!” The effort was too much for the gentleness of woman, and at the conclusion of this heart-stirring appeal, her whole spirit dissolved in tenderness. She cast herself on his bosom, sobbed with convulsive heavings, and looking him in the face, with a mixture of contending emotions, she exclaimed, “Go—serve your country—her claim is greater than mine!” They walked rapidly towards home, without exchanging another word. John took leave of the old continental, mounted his horse, and their farewell was conveyed in a silent look which was never forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “I see nothing before us but accumulating distress. We have been half our time without provisions, and are likely to continue so. We have no magazines, nor money to form them. We have lived upon expedients till we can live no longer.” —Washington's Letter to a Friend. The dark days of the infant republic of America had now come. The enemy, everywhere victorious, had overrun, though he could not subdue, a large portion of the land, and lorded it over some of our capitals. The paper currency, that last and most fatal of all the expedients of despair, was fast depreciating into a mere nominal value; the resources of the country were either exhausted, or could not be procured for such a worthless equivalent; the little waning army, suffering under the privation of almost every necessary of life, and every means of warfare, was struggling without hope, and the cradle of the infant Liberty seemed on the eve of becoming its grave. But amid all these discouragements and disasters, the great mass of the people, the sturdy yeomanry of the country, remained true to the cause of independence; and the destitute soldiers, though raw and undisciplined in the main, continued to display a spirit of hardy endurance, of unconquerable patience, of manly submission, never on any occasion exhibited by standing armies of hirelings. So little did their rulers doubt the patriotism of the people, that when the parliament of England sent commissioners to the United States with offers of forgiveness at the mere price of returning to their allegiance, Congress directed the terms to be published throughout the land, that every man might see and judge for himself. This confidence was not misplaced. The people scorned to accept of pardon, for what they considered no crime; and the attempt to subdue them by an amnesty for the past, only animated their greater exertions in the future. Both men and women, with few exceptions, remained true to the cause, and resolved to drain the cup of suffering to the dregs, rather than turn aside the draught by abject submission. They never despaired, even in the gloomiest times; but, with a generous confidence in an oft defeated leader, resolved to dare all, suffer all, rather than lose the glorious prize for which they had already paid so dearly. It was this noble confidence, this invincible ardour, this unconquerable perseverance, which, aided by the blessing of heaven, and heaven's best gift, a Washington, at length baffled the efforts of one of the most powerful nations of the earth, and gave liberty to a new world. The little army of Washington, after performing wonders in New Jersey, and winning laurels in the depths of the snows, with bare, bleeding feet, and half-naked bodies, was now in winter-quarters at the Highlands of the Hudson, secure, for a brief period, 7* from the efforts of a far superior enemy. They were, in a great measure, destitute of tents; and if this had not been the case, the rough, inclement winter of these northern regions would have rendered these an inadequate defence against the driving snows and boisterous winds, that drifted and howled along the narrow valley, through which the majestic river pursues its way to the Atlantic. Bidding farewell to home, as he believed for a long while, and receiving divers cautions to take care of himself from the old folks, John had, the morning after parting with Jane, pursued his way to the quarters of General Alexander McDougal, one of the earliest and worthiest patriots of New York, with whom his family had been acquainted during their residence in the city, and in whose brigade his father served as a captain of dragoons. The general was of Scottish descent, of a cool determined character, and undoubted courage. Like Napoleon, he was an egregious snuff-taker, and to save the trouble of opening a box, or, because no box of reasonable dimensions would contain his daily supply, usually carried his snuff in his waistcoat pocket, as we have often heard from one of his old companions in arms. From the same authority, we learn that the general's ruffles and buff-jerkin, generally exhibited a plentiful sprinkling of his favourite debauch. Our adventurer first sought his father, and the meeting was affectionately solemn. But after the parent had welcomed his son, he began a long lecture on the impropriety of leaving home, where his presence was required for the protection of the old people, and the cultivation of the farm. “Besides,” added the captain, “you would have seen me soon without coming here. I was about asking leave for a few days, as early as next week—however, John, I should not find fault with you for taking all this trouble to see me. So give me your hand, you are heartily welcome.” “But, sir,” replied John, “I did not come to see you: that is, I did not come on purpose.” “No? what then brought you here?” “I came to fight for my country, sir!” “You? why, you're but a boy—a chicken, what will you do amongst our old cocks?” “Crow, and fight like the rest, father.” “Pooh, John! go home and take care of the farm, and the old people. I'm sure you've run away without permission.” “No, on my word, sir, they consented.” “What! mother too?” “Yes sir. She opposed it at first, but at last said to me, “well go, John, fight for your country, and take care of your father.” “Did she, the dear old soul?” exclaimed the captain, drawing his hand across his brow; “but why should I doubt it, when I have seen so many of our women with the hearts of men in their bosoms? John, you can hardly remember your mother, you were so young when you lost her. Though brought up tenderly in a quiet city, I verily believe she never knew what it was to fear for herself. I have seen her twice in situations that made old soldiers turn pale, without a change in her countenance. If you ever turn coward, John, you will disgrace both your parents. But you are too young for a soldier of freedom. Can you live without eating; sleep without covering; fight without shirt to your back, or shoe to your foot; without pay, and without the hope of victory? If you cannot, you'd better go home. Look at me, John.” John ran his eye over the poor soldier of freedom, and though he had been absent little more than a year, was struck with the change in his face and person. He had grown very thin; his brow was seamed with deep furrows; his hair, which was only a little grizzly when he left home, was now almost white, and a deep scar on his cheek, gave token of his having been within arm's reach of an enemy. Cap he had none, but its place was supplied by a coarse wool hat, of a grim, weather beaten hue, ornamented with a little faded plume, now of a most questionable colour. His epaulette was of the tint of rusty copper; his garments not only worn threadbare, but rent in more than one place; he wore a common leather stock, and his clumsy cowhide boots, the soles of which were gradually departing from each other, were innocent of oil or blacking. His sword was cased in a scabbard of cartridge paper, made by his own hands, and his entire appearance presented no bad emblem of the fortunes of his country. “Well, John, what do you think of me?” John made no answer. His heart was too full for words, but he thought to himself, “Such is ever the price of liberty!” “But don't be discouraged, boy. Though I seem rather the worse for wear, I have plenty of money. Look here—” and the captain drew from his pocket a handful of paper money, with a smile that partook of bitter irony. “See how rich I am, if I could only persuade people to take these rags for money. I offered Mangham, the pedlar—you know him, I believe, a wary rascal—a hundred dollars for a pair of stockings, a luxury I have not enjoyed for some time, but the fellow answered, `No, captain, if I want to be charitable, I give things away; but when I trade, I expect something of equal value for my goods.' He offered to give me a pair for old acquaintance sake, but I could not bring myself to that. So you see me barefoot, with a pocketful of money.” “If I were in your place, sir, I would resign and go home. Let me take your place, while you get a little rest and clothe yourself. I can't bear to see you look like a beggar.” “No, my son,” replied the captain, with a firm determination, unalloyed by a single spark of enthusiasm, “no, John; when I first put on this old rusty sword, I swore never to lay it down till my country was free, or all hope of freedom was at an end. I mean, if God spares my life, to keep my oath, let what else may happen. If my country cannot give me shoes, I will fight barefoot; if she cannot afford me a hat, I will fight bareheaded; and if she can't pay me for my services in money, I will live in the hope of being repaid hereafter by her gratitude. I know she gives us the best she has to give—that she shares in our sufferings—and may God forsake me, when I desert her!” Such were the men who bore the country on their shoulders, through peril, doubt, and despair: such the unknown, nameless heroes, who live only in the blessings they bestowed on posterity. And here lies the mystery which has puzzled the world, namely, the achievement of independence in the face of apparently insuperable obstacles, presenting themselves at every step and every moment, which cannot be explained but by the virtuous firmness, the unwavering patriotism, not more of the high than of the low; not more of those whose names will forever remain objects of national gratitude, than of those whose names were never remembered. The soul that animated and inspired the revolution, spoke from the lips of this nameless soldier. A somewhat animated discussion took place between father and son, on the subject of the latter volunteering his services in the cause of his country. “You'll be half-starved, John.” “I can bear what thousands suffer here.” “You'll be half-naked.” “So are they, sir.” “You'll be ragged and dirty.” “So are you, sir,” said John, rather irreverently. “You'll never be able to go through with it.” “Why not, as well as my father?” “You never smelt powder, or drew blood in the course of your life. You could never find in your heart to cut a man down, even to save your own life.” “Couldn't I?” quoth John—and he drew from his pocket the testimonial of Colonel Courtlandt, giving the particulars of the affair at old Ira Tebow's. The father read it with a feeling of conscious pride, and clapped his hand approvingly on his shoulder. “John,” cried he, after hesitating a few moments, “you were born for a soldier of freedom. Come along, and, like the old patriarch, I will offer up my only son to God and my country.” Accordingly, they proceeded to the quarters of General McDougal, to wit, a hut of rough stone walls, covered with moss-grown shingles, and containing a single apartment, destitute of the most ordinary accommodations. They found the rusty old soldier in a weather-beaten suit of regimentals, solacing himself with his favourite luxury, which he administered with his thumb and two fingers. “Well, captain, what news?” “Nothing, general, except that the tories are up in Monmouth county.” “Ah! so I hear;” and the general took a pinch extraordinary. “General,” said the captain, “I have brought you a young lad, who wishes to share the pleasures of a soldier's life. I have just been giving him some account of them, and he has fallen in love with the profession.” “Aye—and how old may he be, captain?” “Between eighteen and nineteen, sir.” “Too young—too young, captain, by a great deal. He'll be on the sick list, the first campaign, and be sick of the service besides. Young man, can you live upon nothing, and sleep on the ground of a frosty night, without any blanket but the sky?” “I don't know, sir, till I try.” “Eh?—well, that is a more sensible answer than I expected. But do you think you can manage to go half the time without a shirt to your back, or shoe to your foot, in short, without meat, drink, clothing, or lodging—serve without any other pay than what will not pay for anything, fight without the prospect of victory, and look a red coat in the face without turning your back?” “General, I can only answer for one thing—a heart, and I hope an arm, to serve my country. I have other motives than patriotism, which I will not trouble you with. Allow me to say, I believe I can look any man in the face, when I have done nothing that makes me ashamed of myself.” The general thrust his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, and regaling himself with a pinch, half of which, as usual, he spilled on his ruffles and buff-jerkin, ran his eye over the young candidate. “Faith and troth, young man, you're a likely lad, and promise fair. God knows we want men, and must take boys when we can get them. Do you come of a good whig stock, for hang me, if I don't believe whig and tory run in the blood, just like game in fighting-cocks.” “This is my father, sir.” “Ho! ho!—what, captain, have you brought him here?” “He is my only son, general, but I did not bring him here. He came from home by himself, of his own accord, and I confess, I did all I could to make him go back again. But nothing would do, and here he is at your disposal.” “Well, if he is your chicken, he comes of the right breed. Lad, would you like to serve on horseback, or on foot? But for the matter of that, there are not half enough horses to mount the dragoons already enlisted, captain.” “I have brought a horse with me, general,” said John. “Faith, you are a provident lad, and you and your horse shall be welcome. You wish to serve as a volunteer, I believe?” “If you please, general, under my father.” “What—I suppose you would like to go home when you get tired?” “No, sir. I wish to enter as a volunteer, because there is some little merit in serving my country without being obliged to do it.” “Well, lad, I like that answer, and shall probably have occasion for the services of one who acts from such motives. Can you read, write, and cipher, upon occasion? I ask, because in these times schoolmasters are as scarce as guineas.” “He is something of a scholar, general,” replied the captain, “and was educated in New York, under old Macdonald, till the age of fourteen.” “Macdonald, hey? then I am perfectly satisfied. He has had learning instilled into him with the oil of birch. How many times did he flog you, lad?” “I don't know exactly, general. I kept count till fifty, and then lost my reckoning.” The general now dismissed John, with instructions to join his father's company of dragoons, and be sure to return upon the red coats the flogging he had received 8 from master Macdonald. The father and son then took their way to quarters. The young volunteer forthwith entered on his career with an ardour and enthusiasm inspired by patriotism and love. He had two mistresses, his country and Jane, who, so far from dividing, concentrated his heart on one and the same object. His father placed him under an old subaltern of his company, to be drilled, and being already an expert rider, he, in a very short period, became equally distinguished for the steadiness and precision of his movements, as well as skill in the management of his weapons. In short, he practiced unweariedly, in order to accomplish himself in all the arduous duties of a soldier, and disciplined both mind and body to meet all the exigencies of those times which tried the souls of men, and the firmness of women. The American forces being on one occasion drawn out for review on the plain between the foot of the mountains and the river, John had, for the first time, a full opportunity of contemplating the man, who, by his virtues and services, has deserved the highest of all titles, that of father of his country. As he rode along with that graceful dignity for which he was so eminently distinguished, John gazed at him till he almost forgot his soldierly duties; while all that the great and good man had done, and was still doing for his country rushed on his mind. He contemplated him with affectionate reverence, unlimited confidence, and profound gratitude; and, in the delirium of his soul, wished to heaven, that like him, though at humble distance, he might some day be able to do or suffer what might entitle him to the gratitude of his country, and the remembrance of posterity. He felt, what thousands every day experienced, in the presence of Washington, while they all but despaired everywhere else, a degree of confidence in the good cause which inspired him with hope, and animated him to exertion. Men, clothed in rags, suffering hunger and cold, and dispirited by a long succession of disasterous fortunes, awakened from the depths of despondency, and gazed on the blameless hero with reviving hope of the future. Such is the unflinching reliance of mankind on that virtue which has been long tried and never failed. For more than four years had the country been overrun in various directions by an unscrupulous enemy, who stigmatized as rebels a whole nation that had risen in defence of its rights; and who, instead of looking on the Americans as fellow-countrymen, manfully struggling in behalf of every subject of England, viewed them as turbulent mutineers, rising against their lawful commander, and treated them as without claim to the courtesies of civilized warfare. More than four years had the country bled at every pore, and bled almost without the hope its blood would not be shed in vain. During this long period of suffering, seldom were the soldiers of freedom, or the people struggling to be free, cheered forward by success, or animated by victory; and, while every day paying the price of liberty, the boon seemed only every day receding farther and farther from their grasp. Yet, during this trying period, both leaders and people, soldiers and citizens, rejected with unconquerable decision, and wonderful unanimity, every offer of peace without independence. They refused pardon for the past, although almost without hope of the future; they rested with a generous reliance on a leader whose destiny it was to be ever on the defensive without the means of defence; and, amid all their sufferings, disappointments, disasters and defeats, clung, with all the ardour of devoted faith, to their virtuous, courageous, indefatigable leader. Even despondency could not weaken their reliance, and when a victorious general was presented as a successor to Washington, fleeing before a superior enemy, they decided with one heart, one voice, that they would have no other leader. Never did people display a more noble confidence, and never was such confidence more richly repaid.</field>

WINTER-QUARTERS IN THE HIGHLANDS—CHEAP MONEY—TRAITORS IN THE CAMP—A NIGHT-SCENE, WHICH ENDS IN OUR HERO BEING ARRESTED, TRIED, CONDEMNED, AND SHOT— DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SWEARING AWAY A MAN'S LIFE, AND SHOOTING HIM OUTRIGHT. The trials of Washington and his little army, were not alone confined to resisting a superior foreign enemy. His cares never slept, and their sufferings never ceased. Two-thirds of the year they had to cope with a force, from which to escape was a triumph; and during the remainder, they had to wrestle with foes still more difficult to resist. Hunger, cold, nakedness, and all their sad consequences, assailed them from day to day. The wicked never ceased to trouble them, and the weary were never at rest. While in winter-quarters, Washington was incessantly employed in advising, exhorting, and stimulating Congress and the states, to more vigorous exertions: devising and recommending new plans of defence or conquest, and using every effort of argument and persuasion, to infuse into their hearts a portion of his own unconquerable energy. It were too much to assert, that Washington alone saved his country; but 8* it may be said with truth, that without him, it would not have been saved. During the winter of which we are speaking, the sufferings of the army were more than usually severe, owing to the want of many comforts essential during a hard winter among the mountains of the north. They had borne all patiently, at Valley Forge and elsewhere; but there is a limit to human patience, as well as endurance, and the jests, with which they occasionally strove to keep up their spirits, at length began to give place to effusions of bitter spleen, or murmurs of deep dissatisfaction. The rapid depreciation of continental money, as it was called, bore heavily on the soldiers; for such was its daily, nay, hourly decrease in value, that ere they could exchange it for necessaries or indulgences, it had fallen still lower. It was like a wagon trundling down hill, the nearer it got to the bottom, the faster it went. The soldiers, at length, would light their pipes with it in disdain. As they sat idle in their huts of evenings, they would talk of home, and contrast their situation with that of former times, when their labours were light, their food wholesome, and their nights refreshed by undisturbed repose. In short, some of them began to form little cabals, one of which was incited, as well as led, by the old corporal who had drilled John, and who was a foreigner. Pay-day came round, and there was nothing to pay with but continental money, the depreciation of which, no increased quantity could keep pace with. One bitter night, a party of some half dozen were gathered together in one of the huts. They had just received a few thousand dollars, that scarce sufficed to purchase a small pittance of tobacco and other homely luxuries, which the old corporal had invited John to come and share with them. He had complied, though he neither smoked nor drank, being willing to be on good terms with his fellow-soldiers, who, in truth, had no special kind feelings towards him as a volunteer. It was now the dead of winter, savage, gloomy, and severe. The mountains were bare of foliage, save that of the melancholy evergreen, which, when the earth is covered with snow, only increases the desolation of nature by its black hues. The grim, gray rocks, contrasted with savage grandeur the white winding-sheet, which was thrown as a pall over the inanimate corpse of nature. The river was bound in thick-ribbed chains of ice, and the northeast wind swept along through the openings of the high hills, howling mournfully a requiem over the grave of the year. The only comfort within reach of the poor soldiers, was plenty of fuel growing at their very doors; and the party, consisting, besides John, of Corporal Crawley, Aaron Cronk, Pilgrim Pugsley, Hachaliah, commonly Hack Foster, and Case Boshin, the younger, were now gathered about a roaring fire, which would have been much more agreeable, had not the wind dashed down from the mountain-tops into the chimney, occasionally enveloping them in a mystification of smoke that brought tears to their eyes. “Boys,” said the corporal, “I've got a treat for you to-night. I bought a jug of spirits, some pipes, and three papers of tobacco, to-day, at Peekskill. What do you think they cost me?” “More than you're worth, I reckon,” said Case Boshin.” “Eight hundred dollars. It swept my pocket from top to bottom, clear as a whistle. I'm a ruined man; but come let's enjoy ourselves while they last. Who's got a piece of something to light my pipe with, for I see our wooden tongs is on the invalid list.” Case, hereupon pulled out a continental bill, and twisting it between his fingers, handed it to the corporal, who very coolly lighted his pipe with it. The jug was then uncorked, and the party, with the exception of John, proceeded to make large libations. “It's a pretty use for money,” at length observed the corporal, “to be lighting one's pipe with it.” “Yes,” replied Case, “and it's a pretty service this, we've got into; all summer running away from the red coats, and all winter roosting like crows here in the mountains, half clothed, and a little more than half-starved. For my part, my time is out in the course of next spring, and if I don't make tracks home on a hand-gallop, you may call me a horse, and ride me bare-backed, if you like.” “Ah! you're a lucky fellow, Case,” said Hack Foster, “I've got more than a year yet to serve, the d—I take me for listing so long, I say. Liberty is a fine thing, but like gold, it may be bought too dear, I reckon.” They now began to compare notes, and the result was by no means satisfactory, most of them having a considerable time to serve. In the meanwhile, the jug went round briskly, and by degrees they began to be somewhat flustered with the mischievous inspiration. The corporal talked “big,” as the phrase is, and threatened a mutiny; while the others swore they would go home in spite of all the articles of war, and the conversation became equally dangerous to the listeners as to the speakers. John, who had been absent on a visit to a certain lady, in other words, thinking of the last parting, when Jane cast herself on his bosom, and bade him go and serve his country, was at length roused to a cognizance of what was passing, just as Hack was swearing he would give them leg bail before long. “You will—will you?” cried he, coming forward. “you'll desert in spite of the articles of war? You had better try it, if you want to be shot before the whole army, and branded as traitors to your country.” “Booh!” cried the old corporal, puffing out a cloud of smoke—“you're a gentleman volunteer, John. You can go when you please, and come when you like, whenever you want to see your mammy. But you'd better be quiet and mind your own business. We listed for pay and rations, and as we get neither one or the other, I say the bargain is broke, and we have a right to do as we please with ourselves.” “To be sure,” echoed Hack Foster, “to be sure we did. It stands to reason, if one party breaks an agreement, the other has a right to break it too, and for that matter, it's broke already. Supposin, now, I make a bargain with the corporal for a jug of sperrits, and the jug turns out to be empty, do you think I'm obliged to pay him for it? Not I; I'm ex—ex— ex—I can't get out that consarned word; but I know I'm clear as a whistle off the bargain.” “That's law,” quoth Pilgrim Pugsley, “'cause I was onsuited once on a trial afore Justice Day on that very account. It's jist as much as to say, every man must do as he would be done by; and so, if anybody cheats me, I have a good right to cheat him, I guess.” “As clear as preaching,” rejoined the corporal, “and so, my boys, as we get no pay but continental money, that is, no money at all, we have an incombustible right to curse and quit just when we like, in spite of all you can say, mister gentleman volunteer.” “A pretty conclusion, really,” replied the other, “and so you only fight for pay and rations. You have no heart for the cause or the country. As for you, corporal, you have no country, at least, none you choose to fight for; for my own countrymen here, I should think they would be ashamed to desert a cause which is that of all mankind.” “Pooh! mister gentleman volunteer, what's liberty without food, pay, or clothing? You may talk as you please, but d—n my old shoes, if a man can live upon liberty. Here's to you boys, take one more pull, and then the jug will be as empty as my pocket.” The last drop causes the cup to overflow, and this last appeal to the jug, brought the party, our hero excepted, who had declined to partake in the debauch, to the very confines of rational self-possession; for, being the last, each one had taken his full share. They became noisy, and riotous; blurted out disaffection, mutiny, and treason, and were proceeding to organize, as well as their disordered brains would permit, a system of proceeding of the most aggravated and dangerous nature. They swaggered, swore and blustered, in tones so loud and boisterous, that they might have been overheard by their neighbours in the adjacent huts, had not the uproar of the scene without, confounded that within. A violent snow-storm had commenced; the wind shrieked and moaned among the bare branches of the trees, the snow beat through the chinks of the door and windows, almost covering the earthen floor, and gradually extinguishing the fire, which was fast expiring. John had vainly attempted to stay the irritated, intoxicated soldiers; but every attempt only brought on him new taunts and reproaches, until, at length, losing all patience, he leapt in the midst of them, and cried out in a loud, firm voice: “Soldiers! do you know what you are saying? Do you know it is my bounden duty to report every word of it, and that I will do it, as sure as you live, unless you promise to give up this rascally plot of yours? Shame on such cowards, I say, that serve their country as a dog follows his master, because he gives him a bone!” “What! you'll betray us—you'll turn spy and telltale, will you, you chicken-hearted puppy? I never knew a fellow that refused to drink with his companions, but would betray them the first chance that came. But we'll soon stop your wind-pipe for you, if you don't swear pine blank never to say a word about what you've just seen and heared. Tell tales of your messmates—a pretty fellow! come, give us your 'davy that you won't 'peach to-morrow,” replied the old corporal. “Not unless you will all swear to abandon your project, and never allow your tongues such liberty again. If not, I'll have you all up to-morrow, as sure as I stand here.” “You've made up your mind to blab, then,” cried the other, rising, and staggering towards the corner where their arms were deposited. “I'll tell you what— damme what was I saying? before you shall bring us to the bull-ring—we—will lay you as flat as a flounder—where you—you shall never get up again except—ex—at the sound of the last trumpet. Swear— I say mister gentleman volunteer, or you're as good as ten dead men. Hip, boys! every man to his arms— lay hold of the spying rascal, we'll carry him to the rock just by, push him off, and nobody will be the wiser for it to-morrow—he'll be snowed under before that time—lay hold, and gag him!” The whole party obeyed the order, and were about to seize their weapons in the corner, when John, placing himself on guard over that important position, brandished his sword, exclaiming: “The first that approaches is a dead man! mind, I don't wish to hurt you, for you don't know what you are doing, and I'd as soon eat carrion, as fight with such staggering bullies. Stand off, I say, I'll not use my sword against you, but if you come within reach of my fist, I'll strike fire out of your eyes, brighter than they ever flashed before.” This threat, joined to the menacing attitude of the young volunteer, brought the others to a momentary pause. But it is the instinct of drunkenness to thrust its head into the fire; and, accordingly, with threats and bitter imprecations, the whole party staggered forward, pell-mell, the consequence of which was, that one by one they were laid sprawling on the ground, leaving John unhurt, and master of the field. A dead silence now prevailed for a moment, except that the wind howled, the door shook, and the chimney roared like distant thunder. Presently, however, voices were heard without, and a push was made at the door, which opened to a patrol, that entered without ceremony. They were going the rounds, and had been attracted to the spot by the confused hum of voices, all at once succeeded by death-like silence. John was seen standing guard over the arms, while the rest of the party lay some on the ground, perfectly quiet, and others stood see-sawing fore and aft, the blood streaming down their faces. The officer demanded an explanation, but received no reply. John could not find in his heart to become the accuser of his companions in arms, and the others had nothing to say. At length, the demand being repeated, the old corporal, who had been pretty well sobered by the tremendous thumps he received, aided by the apprehension of probable consequences if the truth came out, gathered himself together, and told the story with great accuracy, only making a single mistake, by putting himself and his companions in the place of John, and John in the position of the mutineers. By this simple arrangement, it appeared that the young volunteer had invited the party, seduced them into a debauch, incited them to desert, and finally beaten them almost to death for rejecting his proposal. “May I never live to see my country free,” concluded the corporal, 9 “if I ever saw such a fury as that young chap is in his liquor!” John, though gifted with strong nerves, and great presence of mind, stood confounded by the audacity of the corporal, whose story was straightway endorsed by the rest of the party, with the exception of honest Hack Foster, who was lying on the ground fast asleep, or only pretending to be so, snoring like a brave fellow. The officer perceiving some incongruity in the story, arising from the fact that John appeared to be the only sober man in the company, decided on taking the whole party into custody, and accordingly gallanted them to the guard-house for further examination next morning, when an inquiry was had before a commission of officers, over which General McDougal presided. The old corporal persisted in his story, and was sustained by all his companions, with the exception of Hack Foster, who had become so ill that he was sent to the hospital, and his testimony dispensed with. John was then called on for his defence, which he made with great clearness and precision, and with an air of truth that failed not to make a favourable impression. But the odds were too much against him; and, besides, the accuser, on such occasions, has always eleven points of the law in his favour. He was finally placed in custody to await his trial for offences made capital by the articles of war. Here was likely to be a precious end to all his aspirations of love and glory, since the same testimony which proved sufficient for his committal, would suffice for his condemnation. What would his countrymen, and what would his mistress say of him, now that he lay under the imputation of a baseness, the very thought of which stung him to the quick, and made him sick at heart. Instead of honour and renown, such as he had treasured up as the end of all his efforts, he was now belike, to become a mark for the finger of scorn, a bye-word to express the lowest grade of infamy; a disgrace to his name, his cause, and his country; a thorn in the bosom of the chosen of his heart; a convicted traitor, who had fallen himself, and attempted to drag others down with him to the lowest pit of infamy. “Heaven and earth,” would he exclaim mentally, as he smote his forehead, “what will Jane think of me? She will believe I am guilty, and instead of lamenting my death, abhor my very name, and thrill with horror at the thought of having plighted her faith to one who was not only a traitor himself, but a seducer of others.” In these, and such like bitter contemplations of the past and the future, he was occupying his time, when the entrance of the captain interrupted his reverie. The latter had been absent some days, for a purpose not connected with the course of our tale. The old soldier stood before him sad and stern, for a moment, after which he abruptly demanded of him to declare on his honour, and in the sight of his Maker, as if with his last breath, if he were guilty of the crime of which he stood accused. With a clear voice, and a clear eye, John denied the charge, relating, minutely, every circumstance of the affair, which had taken such an unlucky turn for him. The detail carried conviction to the heart of the parent. The good man grasped his hand with more than usual fervour, as the thought came over him, that however innocently, nay, commendably he might have acted, the unfortunate youth was now, in all probability, to become a victim to the guilt of others. “Farewell, my son,” said he, “and keep a good heart, I am going to do everything that can be done to save your life and honour; though, if these scoundrels persist in their story, and do not contradict each other, I have no hope for you. You must make up your mind for the worst. If you are to die even a disgraceful death, it is still some credit to die like a man. This I know you will do, and though I may not die with you, my son, I will seek the first opportunity to die for my country, that at least one of the name may be buried with honour.” The captain, whose dress, air, and expression of face, had something of the pathetic in them, bade the young volunteer farewell, once more, and then departed on his melancholy—almost hopeless errand. As he proceeded with lingering steps, and John gazed on his mean attire, his almost worn out frame, his gray curls, which, from long neglect, now clustered carelessly about his ears and forehead, he was deeply affected with a mingled emotion of sorrow and pride. The tears came into his eyes, and he thought to himself, what honest worth, steady unpretending bravery, and sterling patriotism, ennobled that ragged, rusty, war-worn old soldier. The first thought of the captain, was to summon the accusers of his son, who all belonged to his company, for the purpose of questioning them closely, and comparing their testimony, in order to detect some contradiction or inconsistency. But against this, his sense of honour and propriety revolted. It might seem as if he was tampering with his soldiers, and using his authority and influence to induce them to prevaricate, in order to screen his guilty son from merited punishment. He accordingly determined patiently to await the decision of the court-martial, and should the unfortunate young man be convicted, take the course which honour and patriotism pointed out. Believing him innocent, he could conscientiously solicit his pardon. The day of trial at length came, and the accusing witnesses having been well drilled by the old corporal, repeated their testimony without varying from that given on the previous occasion, or from each other. They were aware that their own lives depended on convicting John, who, if acquitted, would, without doubt, become their accuser. To their united testimony he had nothing to oppose, but his own bare word; and, though his account of the affair was given with a clearness, condour, and manliness, that made a most favourable impression, he was finally sentenced to be shot. It ought to be here mentioned, that the testimony of Hack Foster was not taken, he being confined in the hospital with a raging fever, accompanied by delirium. During the period between sentence and execution, the unhappy father was employed incessantly in soliciting the pardon of his son, but his efforts were unavailing. It was deemed indispensable to check such attempts on the inflammable materials of a suffering army, in the bud. Much dissipation, and many cabals had already been overlooked, in consideration of the hardships and privations of the soldiers; but it was now deemed indispensable that an example should be made, in order to repress a spirit which threatened the dissolution of the army, and the ruin of the cause. The decision of the court-martial was therefore confirmed, and the youth cautioned to prepare for a fate which was now inevitable. Having lost all hope of pardon, the old weather-worn soldier bent his steps towards the guard-house, where the son lingered in hopeless resignation, if that may be so called which consisted in utter recklessness, whether his father succeeded in his solicitations or not. If pardoned, he was forever a disgraced man, who could never afterwards look his country or his mistress in the face; and if any hope lingered in his heart, it was, that possibly some one of his accusers might, in a moment of awakened conscience, be brought to a confession of his perjuries. Nothing but this could retrieve his blasted reputation, or restore him to the station he once occupied among the defenders of his country. He felt that if he lived, his life would be divested of all that makes it worth preserving; that wherever he went, he would carry the burning brand of disgrace on his forehead, the burden of dishonour, which bears as heavy on the shoulders of the son of a farmer, as the offspring of a king; and, above all, he remembered, that come death, come life, Jane was lost to him forever. She who loved him because he loved his country, would never mix her being with a reprieved traitor; nor would the high-spirited old colonel, who, with all his foibles was a man of honour, ever be brought to give his only child to one who could confer on her nothing but a disgraced name. If, at times, he wished to live, it was only in the latent hope that, at some future period, he might be permitted to die in the cause of freedom, and thus entitle himself to the pity, if not the forgiveness of his country. When, therefore, the father entered the prison, the son addressed him in a cheerful tone, for he saw by his countenance that his fate was determined. He felt for the old soldier, and wished to comfort him by showing he was not afraid to die. “Father,” said he, “I see by your look and your walk that all is decided, and I rejoice it is so. I do not wish to live, but on one condition, which is now all but hopeless. If I could preserve my honour with my life, I would grasp at it eagerly. But of this, there is now no prospect. Tell me, my father; do not be afraid.” “It is all over, my son. To-morrow you are to be shot by your countrymen. I had hoped that if shot at all, it would have been by your enemies in defending your country. But the will of God be done.” “Amen—so be it. I have now but one consolation, I shall die an innocent man; and hope that, by thus suffering here for an offence I never committed, I may obtain pardon hereafter for those of which I have been guilty.” “Say no more—say no more, John. You only make it more hard to part with you,” and the old soldier shed tears. “Father,” said the young man, after a pause, “I have a request to make of you,” and he paused again, overcome by his feelings. “Father, you are acquainted with Colonel Hammond and his daughter. I ought to have told you before, that she was to have been my wife, on conditions which can now never be fulfilled. Here is a letter, I wish, I entreat you, to send as directed, by the first opportunity.” He then proceeded to relate what the reader is already acquainted with, and concluded in a tone of bitter despondency. “All my hopes are now forever blasted. Instead of coming home with honour to claim the colonel's promise, I am going to my grave, where I can claim nothing but infamy. Had I died in defence of my country, and its cause, Jane would have cherished my memory and recollected me with pride; but now, unless she should believe my last words to her, she will, if she remembers me at all, only cherish a serpent in her bosom to sting her to death. Still, I could not make up my mind to die without one last effort to preserve an honourable place in her memory, and to implant in one pure heart, at least, a feeling of pity unaccompanied by contempt and abhorrence. Will you be sure that she gets this letter, sir?” The sorrowing old man received the letter in silence, for he could not speak; but there was that in his silence which gave a solemn pledge that it should be as John wished. That night they passed together, in sad communion on subjects to which the near approach of an eternal separation gave a painful and affecting interest. As daylight dawned, and when the morning gun announced the rising sun, John begged his father to leave him for an hour, as he wished to be alone. The good man understood him, and he was left to prepare for his last great trial. But the captain did not go far. He remained pacing to and fro in front of the guard-house, with such an air of deep and overwhelming sorrow, that the sentinel regretted he had not proposed to John to escape the night before. At the expiration of the hour, he returned, and sat down to breakfast with his son. But neither ate anything, and they were sitting in mournful silence chewing the cud of bitter fancies, when the distant roll of the drum roused them from their deep despondency. “The hour is come!” exclaimed John, starting upon his feet, as if the signal was a relief. “My son,” said the captain, “there is one thing I must tell you, for you ought to know it. Do not think hardly of your father when you see the very men who swore away your life, drafted to execute the sentence, and learn, as perhaps you may, that it was at my earnest solicitation. I had my motives for this, but if they should not be answered, I beseech you to die blessing me—will you?” “With my last breath,” cried John, throwing himself on his bosom. A guard now appeared to conduct the young volunteer to the spot, whence his soul was to take its flight to the region of immortality. To make the example more impressive and awful, the whole army was drawn up in a line to witness the spectacle, and take warning from the example. It was a grand and impressive scene, in which both nature and art combined to produce sublimity. The pure, unsullied snow, soon to be sprinkled with the blood of the victim, not of his own guilt, but that of others, lay like a winding-sheet over the dead body of nature, save where the dark projecting masses of precipitous rocks presented a gloomy contrast to the whiteness all around; the sun glistened on the snow-capt peaks of the western shore; the smoke from a thousand huts curled upwards, in perpendicular columns, to the skies; the air was death-like calm, the atmosphere pure and transparent; the soldiers stood under arms, silent and immovable; the stern music of war roused the echoes of the Highlands, as the young volunteer was brought forth to receive his doom. He walked with a firm step, escorted by a guard, towards the place of execution, and preceded by his coffin borne by two soldiers. His dress was a white cotton gown, resembling a winding-sheet, and over the spot where his heart beat, was placed the representation of a heart painted black to serve as a mark for his executioners. The procession moved forward with measured steps to the music of the dead march of Old Rosin Castle, played by muffled drums and mournful fifes, to a large, open field, in the centre of which was a heap of fresh earth, which marked the spot where the young soldier was to meet his death and find his grave. Around this, the whole army was drawn up in a hollow square to witness the ceremony. The coffin was placed beside the grave. He was told to kneel down on the former, and the officer, under whose direction the execution was to take place, was about to tie a white cap over his head, when he so earnestly entreated that he might be permitted to look his accusers in the face, that his request was granted. His kneeling was the signal for the executioners to advance, and they came forward, taking their station some twelve or fifteen yards distant, flinching, like guilty cowards, as John looked them sternly in the face. The officer raised his sword, the signal for taking aim. He then struck the drum a single tap, and the echoes of the guns leaped from hill to hill till they died in the distance. The smoke cleared away, and the young volunteer was seen still kneeling on his coffin, apparently unhurt. “Scoundrels!” exclaimed the officer, who gave the command to fire, “load again, and see that you take better aim, or you may fill the place of yonder soldier.” Their guns were this time loaded under the immediate inspection of the officer, and while this was doing, the captain walked deliberately past, giving a look of mingled reproach and entreaty, which they well understood. Again the officer raised his sword, and paused a moment, to give them time to take aim, before he struck the drum. At this instant, Aaron Cronk threw down his gun, and exclaimed: “Don't strike! he is as innocent as the general himself!” This assertion, of course, arrested the ceremony; Cronk and his companions were immediately carried to head-quarters; and, being confronted with Aaron, finally confessed the whole conspiracy. Hack Foster, also, who had his conscience awakened by the fear of death, now came forward to make a disclosure, and John was declared not only innocent, but entitled to the highest praise, by the unanimous voice of the whole army. “Young soldier, if I don't mistake, you are just such a man as I have occasion for at times. We shall be better acquainted, soon,” said the father of his country, as he condescended to congratulate him on his providential escape. We pass over the scene between father and son, after this strange adventure, in order to explain the seeming miracle of his escape from the first fire of his executioners. It is certain, that the great majority of villains, consists of men, who, though perhaps they would not shrink from swearing away the life of a fellow-creature, are brought with difficulty to witness and still greater, to become the actual instruments of his execution. Their imaginations, are, indeed, familiarized with guilt, but their senses shrink from its perpetration. Of this class, were the accusers of our hero. They could endure the thought of having caused his death by wilfully forswearing themselves; nay, they could endure to hear of his execution, or, even to become witnesses to the catastrophe, but they could not bear to inflict the deed with their own hands. This required a degree of hardened insensibility to which they had not yet attained. When, therefore, at the earnest instances of the captain, they had been selected to put the sentence in execution, they were horror-stricken; for, such is the pliability of a seared conscience, that it is prone to make distinctions in its own favour, where none exist in the code of moral guilt. There was, however, no escape; and each one, without communicating with his comrade, settled in his own mind to evade the consummation of his crime, by firing wide of the mark. Thus, though the young man would undoubtedly be killed, all imagined they would be innocent of his actual murder. The result has been just detailed. When, however, they were ordered to fire a second time, and with such an ominous intimation of the consequences of again missing, all but Aaron Cronk, decided that self-preservation required them to take good aim this time. Aaron, however, could not go the length of such atrocity, and, accordingly grounded his arms, and surrendered at discretion. Thus was the life of an innocent man preserved as if by miracle; and thus was triumphant guilt arrested in the final moment of its consummation. The mutineers were tried and condemned to be shot, with the exception of Cronk and Foster, who were drummed out of the army. The others, however, managed to escape, and were, without doubt, sooner or later overtaken by the justice of heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10 CHAPTER VII. ONE STORY GOOD TILL ANOTHER IS TOLD—OUR HEROINE NEGLECTS HER HOUSEKEEPING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES—THE COLONEL'S FIRESIDE—COMMEMORATION OF AN OLD FAMILY BIBLE—ARRIVAL OF A STRANGER WITH ILL NEWS—DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR OF AN OLD MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE SAME OCCASION—ANOTHER ARRIVAL WHICH SETS MATTERS ALL RIGHT AGAIN. The first act of our hero, on being alone with his father, was to inquire if he had despatched the letter left in his hands, and he learnt, with deep regret, that it had been sent by a young man who was returning home, his term of service being expired. His road carried him past the door of Colonel Hammond, and as such opportunities seldom occurred, the captain had availed himself of this, by committing the letter to the care of the young soldier. It was now probably in the hands of Jane, who was weeping over his fate, and perhaps despising his treachery. The thought was, if possible, more bitter, than were his feelings when he stood a disgraced soldier, in the presence of the whole army, with half a dozen muskets levelled at his heart. He at once entreated his father to procure him leave of absence for three days, which having received, he mounted his horse on the instant, and galloped away, in hopes of overtaking the bearer of the letter before he reached the home of his heart. It was now evening, towards sunset, and the distance some five and twenty miles; but his steed was staunch, the rider, a lover, on his way to his mistress, and the people on the road, when they saw him darting along, said to each other, “that soldier is either a deserter, or a messenger from head-quarters!” Leaving him to travel by himself, we shall precede him to the residence of the old continental, where he will, no doubt, arrive in good time, if his horse holds his wind, and the rider does not break his neck by the way. After parting with her lover, as described in a previous chapter, Jane sought relief from the indulgence of her bitter-sweet anxieties, where it is always to be found, in the performance of our duties to ourselves, and to others. The habit of being useful, is a glorious habit; it is like mercy twice blest, for it contributes equally to our own happiness, and that of all within the sphere of its exercise. It is impossible to resist the cheering, reviving influence arising from the consciousness of doing good to our fellow-creatures, from motives of affection or duty; and they who seek a balm to their own sufferings, will always find it in alleviating those of others. This truth most especially applies to women, and above all, to those who are placed by accident or fortune above the necessity of daily labour. These are ever most prone to become the unresisting victims to that tender weakness which seems to constitute the very nature of the sex, and under whose despotic sway they are so apt to sink into a state of useless imbecility, which makes them a burden to themselves, a blight to the domestic fireside. A hopeless attachment, the loss, or recreancy of one they love, often becomes a consuming canker, eating into the heart by its own wilful indulgence, and only the more incurable from the absence of all efforts to effect a cure. Novels and romances, for the most part, administer to this fatal weakness, by inculcating that it is both refined and praiseworthy; and that no female can aspire to the dignity of a heroine, who possesses force of mind, or strength of principle, to sacrifice a selfish weakness at the shrine of her social and domestic duties. In the moral code of romance, the indulgence of excesses in any other passion is a crime, while those of love partake of something almost divine, and appertain to beings of a superior order, who are not to be judged by the standard of morals or religion. The good sense, good habits, and good principles of Jane, preserved her from sinking under the enervating influence of a feeling, whose highest and noblest exercise is in stimulating to greater efforts of virtuous heroism. It cannot be denied, that on the day she parted from John, there was less appearance of order in the arrangement of the parlour, and a little more dust on the mahogany than usual. The testy old continental, moreover, complained that his pipe was in one corner, his tobacco-box in another, and nothing in its right place. On his retiring for the night, Jane was roused from a painful reverie by a tremendous explosion of wrath from the old gentleman. It seems his night-cap was not where it should be, there was no pillow-cases, and the entire order of the bed-clothes totally subverted, the sheets being where the blankets ought to have been. “Thunder and Mars! what is all this? Jane—Jane, I say, come here this minute,” roared the colonel, as the feathers stuck in his ear, and the wool tickled his nose. The love-stricken damsel hied to his room, and a blush mingled with a smile, as she discovered the occasion of this outcry. “Look,” exclaimed the wrathful old continental, “look here, you baggage, I might as well have a shoe-brush or a curry-comb at my nose, and a straw in my ear—I'm worse off than at the siege of old Ti, when I slept under a rye-stack and was half-choked with the beards. What a plague has come over you, Jane? Oh! ah! now I recollect—hum—come, kiss me, Jane, —I know what you were thinking of, when, for the first time in your life, you forgot your old father.” A reconciliation took place, and the grievances of the colonel were speedily redressed; but Jane remembered the lesson, and he was never afterwards annoyed by the absence of his night-cap, or the shoe-brush and curry-comb under his nose. From that time she rallied herself to the performance of her daily duties, and never indulged the weakness of her heart, except in the sober leisure of a twilight evening, or in the repose of darkness, when she often lay awake amid the dead silence of the midnight hour, thinking over past times, and anticipating the future, with mingled hope and apprehension. On Sabbath-days, she said her prayers and read her Bible, whose simple, yet lofty eloquence, and touching tenderness, often went to her heart, and awakened those 10* feelings which lie dormant in every human bosom. But the favourite portions of the old continental were those of a warlike character, on which he banqueted with peculiar satisfaction, criticising the military movements with infinite discretion, and excepting to the whole system of ancient tactics, which he could do without impeaching his orthodoxy, for he stoutly maintained that not one of the commanders could lay claim to inspiration. He swore by Thunder and Mars, that if he had commanded at Jericho, he would have defied all the rams' horns in the universe; and as for Sampson's jaw-bone, it would not have cut much of a figure at old Ti. There were churches at a distance of a few miles, but seldom, if ever, in these disastrous times, was the simple song, or the voice of the preacher, heard to break on the calm of the Sabbath-day. There, the swallows built their nests; the windows and doors were broken, and all within was silence and desolation. Scarcely a solitary traveller was seen on the high roads, for the business of life had resolved itself into the work of death and destruction. The rustic temple of the muses, the deserted school-house, no longer resounded with the hum of the gabbling fry, issuing from the mimic Babel, nor was the sonorous voice of the big master—checking their blunders, or reprehending their misdemeanors, or encouraging their successful efforts at murdering the language—now, the king's English no more—ever heard by the solitary traveller who happened by chance to wander that way. Instead of the deep traces of those boyish gambols, which whilome marked the site consecrated to teaching the young idea how to shoot, rank weeds had overgrown the spot, such as deform the face of nature, and give sure token of idleness, neglect, and desolation. Religion, law, and learning, had fled before the fierce whirlwind of war, or only nestled at the domestic fireside in fear and trembling. In recalling these fearful and melancholy times, an old relic of the revolution once said to us—“We lived without law or gospel; we were paying the price of liberty with our substance and our lives.” The sequestered spot we have heretofore described, of all the surrounding country had alone hitherto escaped the ravages of war; but none could tell how soon his turn would come to share the fate of his neighbours, for it seemed decreed by Omnipotent wisdom, that as all were to partake in the blessings of freedom, so all must, sooner or later, pay their portion of the purchase. It was now verging towards the spring, but no signs of its approach appeared to soften the grim visage of winter. The day was Sunday, and the evening hour had come early as is its wont in that season of the year. The fire crackled cheerfully in the capacious chimney of the old continental, which was innocent of all modern improvements, or economical contrivances for persuading people to freeze on philosophical principles. An old pointer lay on one side of the fireplace, and a venerable cat luxuriated on the other, each having occupied the spot where they now reclined of a winter evening, from time immemorial, and acquired a prescriptive right by long undisturbed possession. Once, and once only, within the memory of man, had old Boss, as he was called, either in that spirit of usurpation which seems inseparable from all created beings, or from sheer absence of mind, taken possession of the corner consecrated to the venerable pussy. But “he got his bitters” with a vengeance. Cats and women, are said to carry the ten commandments at their fingers' ends, and poor Boss suffered the consequences of this new exposition of the law and the prophets. He never after attempted an invasion of neutral rights, and from that time peace and good-will presided at the domestic fireside. The old continental and his daughter were seated before the blazing hickory fire, one smoking his pipe, the other with her head, and it may be, her heart, full of something that shrouded her face in sadness. The cat sneezed three times in quick succession, and the colonel thereupon confidently predicted a snow-storm, adding, “Come, Jane, bring out the old Bible, and read me the story of little David and Goliah.” Jane obeyed, and brought forth the venerable volume. It was a family heirloom, such as is seldom seen in these days, when Bibles have become so plenty and so cheap, that they have almost lost their reverence, and we ourselves have seen their sacred leaves appropriated to the most unseemly purposes. For this reason, we shall describe this old relic, and because it is associated in our memory with all that is venerable in piety, all that is commendable in unaffected simplicity. It was a heavy folio, the binding of which seemed emblematical of the eternal word which it enveloped. The back was covered with hinges of massy silver, so contrived, that the book opened and shut with perfect ease, when the clasps of the same metal in front were unloosed; and at each corner were spacious ornaments of rich silver open work, extending over a large portion of the covering. All these ornaments were of exquisite workmanship, in a fine old Doric taste, and finished with infinite labour. Assuredly, there is something like affinity between such lasting and massive volumes, and the eternal truths they inculcate. The casket seems worthy the jewels it contains, and the superior reverence of our forefathers for religion, may be estimated, in some degree, by the stateliness of their Bibles, as well as the care they took to preserve them. In those times, the Bible was a precious inheritance, bequeathed from generation to generation—a memorial of pious ancestors, whose hands had often turned its leaves, whose souls had derived precious nurture from its sacred fountain. But we are falling into the fashion of the time, and mingling eternal truths with worldly fictions. Jane continued to read, and the colonel to make his comments, until the good gentleman, as was too often his custom, fell into a doze, and began talking to himself in a broken series of disjointed fragments, beyond all comprehension. These were, however, only momentary wanderings, and coming to himself, with a snort, accompanied by a start, he opened his eyes, exclaiming at the same time: “By the way, as I was saying,” he had not said a word on the subject, except, perhaps, in his sleep, “as I was saying, have you heard from that puppy, John, since he went away?” “No, father,” repeated she, with faltering lips, and twinkling eyes. “Thunder and Mars! can't the fellow write?” “But what is the use of writing, sir, when there is no way of sending a letter? you know, father, there is no post running now, and I have not seen a single traveller pass since he went away.” “What—you have mounted guard and kept a good look-out, hey?” “I don't deny it, sir, for I own I am anxious to hear from him. I think of going over to-morrow to his grandfather's to inquire, if you have no objection.” “Not I, Jane. But I dare say he is sick enough of his bargain, by this time. Thunder and Mars! Jane, if you only knew what a soldier's life is. Nothing but marches and countermarches—guns, drums, and wounds, powder, grape-shot, fire, fury, hunger, thirst, cold, and the deuce knows what besides. I should'nt be surprised if the fellow had deserted by this time, or died of the home-sickness, not I.” “O, father! how can you say so? such is not the picture I draw, in the midst of my fears. I think I see him animated by love of his country, and the hope— the hope you have given him—preparing himself, by never ceasing efforts, to win the prize, humble as it is; animating and inspiring his companions in arms to do all, dare all, in the cause of mankind. I know him better than you do, sir, and something tells me that, as I heard him once say to his grandfather, his name will yet ring among his fellow-soldiers. I fear for his life, but not for his honour. Little as is my value, he will win me, or die.” At this moment, the sound of horses' feet was heard rapidly approaching, and, as if by an uncontrollable influence, Jane ran to the door, which eagerly opening, she looked out amid the starless night, where nothing could be seen but the drifting snow, which now began to fall, and nothing heard but the wind moving among the leafless branches of the trees. Immediately a voice exclaimed: “Is Colonel Hammond at home?” It was not the voice she wished to hear, but one she had never heard before. At length, however, she answered: “He is—will you come in, sir?” The stranger entered, and was welcomed by the colonel in the homely old-fashioned style of those days. The colonel, by way of entering wedge, after the guest was seated by the cheerful fire, observed it was a stormy night, and the traveller assented; for, no one not troubled with the spirit of contradiction, would have thought of contesting such a self-evident proposition. A short silence ensued, but as every one knows that the appetite for news is innate among country-people, and more especially among our countrymen, the old continental at length inquired of the stranger if he was from head-quarters. He replied in the affirmative, adding, that he was on his way home, having served out his time, and that the storm had obliged him to claim shelter for the night, if he could be accommodated where he was. The old continental assured him of a hearty welcome, and ordered his horse to the stable, while Jane was in a great fit of the fidgets. Her lips parted more than once, as if to speak, but closed again, only breathing a deep sigh. “How are things getting on at head-quarters?” at length asked the colonel. “Bad enough,” replied the stranger. “The soldiers are almost destitute of food and clothing, and some have become discontented, not to say disaffected. A few of them have been plotting desertion, and mutiny, and one, a young fellow from this neighbourhood, has been condemned to be shot; and, now I think of it, I've got a letter from him to this young woman.” Saying this, he fumbled in his pocket, and drawing forth a letter, handed it to Jane, who received it with trembling hand, and cheeks white as the snow falling without. Her heart grew sick, almost to fainting, and she stood supporting herself by a chair, with the letter in her hand. At length, venturing to look at it, she recognised the writing, and sliding from her hold, sunk down on the floor, helpless, though not insensible. With mingled feelings of sorrow and indignation, the colonel, assisted by the stranger, raised up and supported the blighted blossom, muttering, at intervals, to himself, “my poor Jane! my God, she is dying!” and “Thunder and Mars! what a cowardly young rascal, to desert his country!” The smitten maiden recovered by degrees, and was seated in the colonel's arm-chair, where, summoning to her aid the pride and dignity of woman, or, perhaps, the courage of despair, she opened the letter with a firm hand, and began to read. As she proceeded, her bosom heaved, her cheek became flushed, her eye sparkled, and at the conclusion, she exclaimed “he is innocent! father, he is innocent! and a just providence will never suffer him to die the death of a traitor! see here, dear father!” The colonel took the letter, and read it attentively, without a word. Then he stamped about the room for a time, with his hands crossed at his back, while ejaculating to himself something like the following soliloquy: “The young rascal! it is all a lie, from beginning to end. What! six men all put their heads together to swear away the life of an innocent man! I don't believe a word of it, for it is impossible, but they must have contradicted each other. It's a lie, a cowardly lie! only to make Jane more miserable by lamenting the young rascal after he's dead. And yet, I could never believe this of John. He was always a bold, frank, up and down lad, and nobody ever caught him in a lie. I remember when the young rascal spoiled my patent plough, by not knowing the philosophy of it, and old Cæsar was blamed, he came forward like a man, and took it all on himself. Hum—may be what he says is true. Jane—my dear child, cheer up, my little blossom. It will be good sleighing to-morrow, and bright and early I'll drive to head-quarters. The general will never deny an old comrade the life of an innocent man.” “You'll be too late, sir,” said the stranger, bluntly, and without reflecting on consequences. “He was shot this morning. I heard the volley fired as I passed over the mountain.” “He is dead then!” shrieked Jane, as sinking back 11 in her chair, she sat pale and still as a statue, while not a single tear trickled from her eyes. She did not faint, but her mind and body both remained benumbed with the sudden shock. Her heart was cold, and her brain unconscious of all but indistinct imagery flitting about, as it were, without form or identity. The stranger soon retired to rest, saying he should be off by day-light in the morning, and the father and daughter were left alone in their misery. It was now waning towards midnight, and the storm waxed louder and louder; the winds moaned bitterly, ever and anon startling the freezing silence of the night, and almost realizing the poetic fiction of the spirit of the storm, riding the blast with desolation in his train. As they sat in the hopeless silence of deep-rooted sorrow, Jane was roused from the trance of grief, by what she imagined, the trampling of a horse in the snow, amid one of those pauses so frequently occurring in the fiercest storms, when nature seems to stop her career for a moment, to recover breath for more vehement exertions. She listened with intense and eager anxiety, but the sound was again lost in the loudness of the storm. Another pause—and the tramping of footsteps was heard on the piazza. This time the colonel heard it too, and the first idea being that it was a party of Skinners, tories, or Cow Boys, come to pay him a visit, he seized his old rusty sword, which always in these dangerous times, hung up in the sitting-room, a memento of the siege of old Ti, as well as a text for many a long rigmarole story of the old French war. While stamping about with this formidable weapon in his hand, Jane had ventured to the door opening on the piazza, whence she returned borne in the arms of a man covered with snow from head to foot. “Thunder and Mars! What does all this mean?” exclaimed the old continental, advancing, sword in hand. “What, colonel, don't you know me?” exclaimed a voice, which he recollected perfectly. “Know you! by the memory of the immortal Wolfe, it's John! But stand off, sir—none of your hand, sir, and put down my daughter instantly, I command you, sir. Don't touch the hem of her petticoat, you rascal, till you've proved to me you don't deserve hanging. The only daughter of Colonel Hammond must not rest in the arms of a rascally mutineer, though he may have been pardoned. But—hum—ha—yes—Thunder and Mars! I forgot. I suppose you've proved your innocence, hey? Well, by the Lord Harry, John, I'm glad to see you for all that. Jane, confound you, make haste and come to yourself, that I may hear all about it; and John, mind, if you've run away from justice, I'll have you tied neck and heels, and sent back to-morrow. Make haste, Jane, I say; you think I'm as patient as that obstinate old blockhead, Squire Day.” John placed Jane tenderly in the old arm chair, and what he said to her in doing so is a mystery, but the effect was magical. She opened her eyes, and lips, too, exclaiming in tones of proud triumph, mingled with glowing affection— “I knew you were innocent of deserting your country!” “Yes, yes,” said the colonel, “but the matter is not quite so clear yet. He may be only pardoned, not acquitted, and of the two, I'd rather for my part, he had been shot outright; or he may have escaped, for aught we know. Come, sir, let us hear the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, before I decide whether to take you by the hand or turn you out of doors. We know from your letter all that happened up to yesterday; let us hear the rest in as few words as possible. None of your rigmaroles, John.” Thus cautioned, the young soldier took up his story where it had been left in his letter, and probably to prevent Jane from jumping out of her skin, took fast hold of her hand while he related the particulars. It is out of our power to depict the feelings of that amiable, excellent girl, during the recital; but this we know, that whenever he came to a critical point in his story, he felt a thrilling pressure of the hand held captive in his own; that as the catastrophe approached, that little soft hand trembled, and grew cold; and that when he came to the lifting up the sword, the tap of the drum, and the discharge of the muskets, she looked in his face with agonized tenderness, as if to see that he was yet alive. When he had done, she drew her hand gently from his, and clasping both her own together, exclaimed— “The hand of Heaven was in it, and to Heaven all our gratitude is due!” “John,” said the old continental, “I shan't turn you out in the snow, to-night, I believe. Give me your hand, boy. Your honour is cleared. You have deserved well of your country, and are worthy to be my son-in-law. But—hum—not quite yet, though. You've done nothing but escape by miracle from being shot for doing your duty. You must do something more than this according to our bargain.” “I know it, sir. I mean to do more, if I am spared, before another year goes over my head. I shall keep my word, sir, and never claim my bride till I feel myself worthy of the blessing.” “Spoke like a true heart. But, Thunder and Mars! John, now I think of it, I don't exactly comprehend how the grandson of an old farmer came to talk and act so much like a gentleman. I always thought such things ran in the blood, but you seem to have got them from nature.” “And why not, sir? Let me tell you, Colonel Hammond, that the same high and noble impulses lie dormant in the bosom of the peasant as in that of the king, and that nothing is wanting to awaken them to life and action, but incitement and opportunity. Inspired, as I am, by love and liberty—with such a prize as this to gain, and such a cause as ours to defend—I must be meaner than the dirt on which I tread, if I don't become more than a gentleman.” “I believe you are right, John, that is, so far as I understand you; for may I be shot for mutiny, as you came so near being, if you are not sometimes as deep as that old blockhead, Squire Day, who half the time can't make himself understood, and the other half don't understand himself.” But there was another auditor who understood, and gave him such a look as he comprehended just as easily as he could distinguish 11* every feeling of her heart in the clear mirror of her liquid eye. The worthy old gentleman had delivered himself of a succession of stupendous yawns, at the conclusion of his last speech, and with him, the next step was plump into the region of Morpheus. He always fell asleep extempore, which, in our opinion, is a faculty that makes amends for at least one-half the evils which constitute the chief inheritance of mankind. Let no one complain of his fate, while his nights are refreshed by the dews of balmy rest, and happy dreams. How the young couple employed the interval, during which the old soldier was sleeping on his post, is none of the reader's business, nor ours either. All we shall disclose, is, that John was in the act of telling his story the third time, when he was interrupted by the colonel, who burst suddenly into an eruption of expletives, which interrupted the thread of his discourse, and startled Jane to such a degree, that she snatched away her hand just as if something had bit her. “Thunder and fire!—Dash on, my boys! huzza for old Ti! down with the Parley voux and the Indians!” cried the old continental, starting up at the same time, and breaking his pipe over John's head. “Ah! ah! you copper-coloured caitiff, I think I've done your business, hey?” Awakened by the exertion, he rubbed his eyes, stared about, and at length said, “By the Lord Harry, I believe I've been napping.” Then looking at his watch, and finding it was far towards morning, he commanded them to seek the land of Nod—where many a man, besides Cain, has found a wife in dreams, —and soon the uproar of the storm without, combined with the peaceful, happy feelings within, lulled them all into a luxurious repose, during which, Jane dreamed she was married to John, and that he turned out to be his old grandmother. She awoke with the fright, and finding the sun shone out brightly, arose, and commenced the performance of her customary household duties, with a heart as light and as pure as the flakes of snow that were whirling about in the eddies of a brisk northwester.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. A HAPPY YOUNG COUPLE THAT WANT NOTHING—DISCREET CONDUCT OF OUR HEROINE—COLLOQUY BETWEEN TWO OLD PEOPLE—FRIEND UNDERWOOD AND HIS FAMILY—THE SADDLE ON THE WRONG HORSE—JOHN ARRIVES AT HEAD-QUARTERS —ACCOMPANIES THE CAPTAIN ON A PARTY OF OBSERVATION —A SURPRISE, A CAPTURE, AND A CHASE, WHICH ENDS IN RUNNING DOWN THE HUNTERS INSTEAD OF THE GAME. After being six times reminded of his duty, and at length fairly pushed out of doors by Jane, our hero at length mounted his steed, and pursued his way to the old stone house to pay his respects to the good old patriarch and his wife. He was received with a simple, affectionate welcome, conveyed in few words; and when, in answer to their inquiries, he related the story of his wonderful escape, the old dame shed tears of mingled horror and gratitude, while the gray-haired patriarch shook him by the hand, and was proud of his grandson. After spending an hour or so, conversing on these matters, and hearing and answering various minute inquiries about his father, John began to show symptoms of restiveness, which he judiciously placed to the account of his horse, that was standing in the snow pawing away manfully. To the proposal, that he should be put in the stable, our hero replied, that he was going to spend the day with Colonel Hammond by special invitation; on hearing which, the old lady exchanged a significant look with her mate, who said nothing, but thought a great deal, according to the custom of wise old gentlemen. But it not being in the nature of the sex to be content with dumb-show, the look was followed up by words of the following import— “Well, I declare!” said the old dame, “who would have thought it? So you are going to stay all day at the colonel's! and you slept there all night, too! Well, I declare! who knows what may happen!” “Neither you or I, Rachel,” quoth the wiser vessel; “but I've heard say, an ounce of luck is worth a pound of understanding.” “Yes, and you know, grandfather,” so she always called him, “you know it is written in the tenth chapter of Jeremiah, that some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and others with a wooden ladle.” “I don't think you'll find that in Jeremiah, Rachel, but I dare say it is true for all that.” “Well, then it's in the book of Proverbs, for I am pretty sure I saw it there, though my memory is not quite so good as it was before the old French war. But I will soon see.” Accordingly she took down the old Bible but whether the passage was found in Jeremiah, or the book of Proverbs, does not appear from any authentic documents. John passed his time, previous to joining the army, in unalloyed happiness, or, at least, only alloyed by the thought of a speedy parting with Jane. Historians and romancers—if the phrases are not synonymous— have told us a thousand times that happiness cannot be described; but we confess we do not believe a word of it. Why should there be more difficulty in depicting the smiles, than the tears of humanity? Why are the pure enjoyments of virtuous love, the cheerful scenes of domestic happiness, the rich prospects of national peace and plenty, not equally susceptible of being delineated, with the excesses of the passions, the crimes and sufferings of guilt, or the bloody and atrocious scenes of war? Alas! we fear it is not the difficulty of painting the picture, but of finding admirers, that gives such disproportioned space to the records of crime and suffering, over those of virtue and happiness. Is it not, that having, in a great measure, lost the capacity of enjoying these innocent delights ourselves, like the parent of death and sin contemplating the happiness of the first pair in the garden of Eden, we turn in sickening envy from the scene, as one in which we can never partake, and seek excitement in banqueting on those splendid exhibitions of guilt and misery which ever follow in the track of heroes and demigods? We have, however, a different reason for refraining from enlarging on the happiness of John and his affianced bride, namely, the apprehension that some of our readers might pine away with envy in contemplating the picture of virtuous love sanctioned by parental authority, and beckoned forward by enchanting hope to a long perspective of fancied bliss. “With whom does time gallop withal,” if not with such favoured mortals? The day flitted away like a blissful dream, and the morrow brought only a recurrence of what was even more delightful in the repetition. But at length the period arrived, when they were to pay the full price of all the pleasures of meeting by the pangs of parting. We shall not describe the scene minutely, for it was as like as two honey-bees to that delineated on a former occasion, making allowance for the difference of weather. Then, nature was all arrayed in smiles; now, she was wrapt in her gloom and severity, lifeless, though not dead, awaiting the touch of balmy, life-inspiring spring, to wake her into music, smiles, and blushes. We shall only say, that as the lovers were exchanging their mutual farewells in the presence of the old continental, each, as if influenced by a common feeling, looked wistfully, if not beseechingly, in his face, as if to ask something at his hands. “Well, what is it?” said he. “What have you got to say to me, John?” “Nothing, sir,” replied John. “And you, young madam?” “Nothing, sir,” replied Jane. “Nothing, sir,” exclaimed the colonel, mimicking each in turn, “nothing, sir. Then, sir, please to face to the right about, mount your horse, and be off; the snow is so deep, you will hardly save your distance, for your leave expires to-day. Good-bye, take care you are not shot for a deserter.” “Take care,” said Jane, with glistening eyes, “take care you are not shot by the red coats.” “Pooh!” cried the colonel, “what do you think a man enlists as a soldier for, except to be shot at? But come, sir, mount, I say, and don't let me see your face again till you have fulfilled your part of our bargain. You understand?” They parted. Jane watched his course, until she could see him no more, then wandered about the home a while, from room to room, not knowing what she sought, and finally sat down to mend the colonel's silk night-cap, which was a treasure in these times, when men scarcely wore a head, much less a cap on it. As the good little girl plied her long darning-needle, which was also a treasure, brought from New York by Mangham, the pedlar, it operated as a charm, just like Mesmerism, and, by degrees, soothed her throbbing heart into quiet resignation, cheered by the hope of soon meeting again to part perhaps no more. When she next encountered her father, it was with her accustomed sweet, cheerful smile, and all again went on smoothly as before in the domicil of the old continental. Blessed, yea, thrice blessed, are the employments of the hand, for they are the best assuagers of a wounded heart. Our hero proceeded but slowly on his journey, owing to the road being covered with deep snow. Not a single track denoted that man or beast had preceded him; for the men of the country around, with the exception of the old and infirm, were either soldiers or fugitives, and the cattle had, with few exceptions, been driven away by their owners, or carried off by parties of plunderers. He lost his way three times, but whether owing to the obscurity of the road, or his head being full of other thoughts, must be left to the decision of the discreet reader. His course led him across Croton river, at a ferry then kept by a respectable Quaker, who, as a non-combatant, enjoyed a certain qualified exemption from the evils of the times, though it must be confessed he was treated with very little ceremony by both red coats and continentals. A neutral, in time of war, most especially such a one as that of our revolution, is game for both parties, and generally squares accounts by making game of them. The peaceable Quaker had frequently experienced this truth, and as frequently put it in practice; but on the whole, like most of those mysterious broad-brims, he resembled the sheep not alone in practising the doctrine of non-resistance, but in another peculiar characteristic, for, the more you sheared him, the thicker became his wool. According to his own account, he was plundered almost every night, yet, strange to say, he waxed richer and richer every day, and was the only farmer in all the country round, that had not his broken windows stuffed with old hats, and worn out garments. He was suspected, but without cause, of having a sneaking preference for king George, but in his heart he yearned for liberty. The truth of the matter is, that he had an irresistible preference for guineas over continental money, and could not resist the temptation of supplying his enemies in preference to his friends. In short, he was a hard-money man, for he adored specie, and eschewed shin-plasters incontinently. His wife, however, like almost every farmer's wife and daughter of the heroic age of our country, was sincerely attached to the good 12 cause, and three stout, strapping boys, kept at home by their father, was deeply imbued with her feelings. Our traveller halted at the house of friend Underwood for refreshment and rest, and was received rather coolly; but, as he called John, friend, it served as an apology for treating him in rather an unfriendly manner, for good words are a sort of continental money, and act as worthless substitutes for the sterling value of good deeds. Farmer Underwood could tell a man afar off who dealt in paper promises, or shin-plasters, as they now began to be opprobriously called, and he saw, at a glance, that our hero was wanting in the one thing needful; however, he invited him in, and offered a seat at a cheerful blazing fire. Comfort is, indeed, the badge of all the tribe, and no one ever saw a Quaker who dressed in rags, cultivated lean land, or lived in a poor house. While the steed of our hero discussed his provender, the party at the fireside was engaged in conversation on public affairs. The neat, simple, and indeed handsome Quaker dame, in the meantime busied herself about her domestic concerns, ever and anon stopping to listen to John's details of the position of the army in the Highlands. Farmer Underwood, at length, asked him if he was not tired of such hard service, saying it was a poor business to fight without victory, and live without food. “Dost thee hear, boys,” said he, as the boys came in to dinner. “Dost thee hear how the continental soldiers are without shoes, or shirts, and that their bellies are as badly off as their backs. How much better art thee off with a good house over thy head, and everything to comfort the inward man.” “But, friend Underwood,” answered John, “if all the men staid at home, what would become of the cause, and the country? It would be overrun by the red coats, and we should be no better than slaves.” “We should then live in peace and quiet, friend.” “Peace and quiet! do you call it peace and quiet, when you are pinned to the ground by a pitchfork, or a bayonet, with the foot of an enemy on your neck, to keep you from writhing? Do you call it peace and quiet, when you are only let alone because you have not the spirit to turn like a worm, when trod upon? Do you call it peace and quiet, when you lie shivering under the bed-clothes, while robbers are rifling your house, laying waste your fields, insulting your wives and daughters, because they will not cry God save the king? By my soul, friend Underwood, I would rather be in the midst of an earthquake, than enjoy such peace and quiet as this.” “Friend,” said the Quaker dame, who had stood listening to this animated appeal, her large black eyes kindling as he proceeded: “Friend, is there anything in the house thee would like? Thee shall be kindly welcome.” John thanked her gratefully, but declined the offer. “Obadiah,” quoth farmer Underwood, “thee hadst best go and see after the stranger's horse; and Nehemiah, thee art wanted at the wood-pile; and Uriah, thee should be threshing in the barn, for thee must go to mill to-morrow.” The young men departed unwillingly, with their cheeks in a glow, and when John soon after followed, to saddle his horse, he found them shouldering their flails and pitchforks, and marching to and fro about the barnfloor, practising military manœuvres. On his departure, he tendered the price of his entertainment, but the good woman declined receiving it, saying, in a low tone, “thee art serving thy country, and defending its women and children, and such should find welcome everywhere.” He took her by the hand, and departed, thinking to himself, that the saddle was on the wrong horse, and that the Quaker and his wife ought to change garments. “Friend,” said Obadiah, as he passed the barn, where the youngster was going through the manual with a pitchfork, “friend, was that done judgematically?” “Like an old continental,” replied John, and gayly setting forward, a ride of some two or three hours brought him to his old quarters, where the captain welcomed him with great cordiality. From this period, his time passed in the regular, and somewhat monotonous routine of soldierly duties, until the breaking up of the ice, the melting of the snow, and the chirping of the little birds, announced the coming of the spring. Another campaign was about to open, with prospects ill calculated to inspire any hope that the future would make amends for the past. While the republican army had been suffering grievous privations, and a continual diminution from the expiration of their brief terms of service, that of the enemy had been quartered in the city of New York, enjoying the gayeties of life, in the midst of plenty and repose. Superior in numbers, discipline, and equipments of every kind, the royal army, flushed with the recollection of past, and the confidence of future victories, had little else to do but scour the country at pleasure, during the summer, and feast and frolic through the livelong winter. Previous to opening the campaign, it was desirable, if possible, to gain precise information of the state of affairs in New York, the probable time the enemy would be in motion, and the course he would pursue. For this purpose, a small detachment was placed under the command of the captain, with instructions to approach York Island, under cover of night, and, if possible, seize some straggler from the British lines, who might, perhaps, communicate the desired information. John was one of the party selected, and one evening, just about dusk, they proceeded on their critical and important mission. The distance was too great to be reached that night, and arriving just about daylight at Hungry Hollow, the captain determined to halt in this sequestered spot until evening, assured that here they would be safe from all observation. Nothing of consequence occurred, except that John suggested to the captain the propriety of his riding over to see the old people at the stone house, and received a sharp reprimand for his pains. The design was to approach Kingsbridge in the dead of night, beat up some outpost, and carry off one or more prisoners. The evening came in gloomy and dark, the sky being deeply overcast with clouds, and cautiously pursuing their way by a back road, some miles from the river, they at length approached the bridge, which at this time formed the only communication from the island to the mainland. Here the 12* captain halted his little troop, detailed once more the plan of operations, and commanding that no one should utter a word, on pain of the severest punishment, proceeded cautiously forward, until he caught a view of the glimmering at the guard-house on the south end of the bridge. The darkness of the night had increased with its progress, and the silence of death reigned all around, save the grinding of the horses' feet in the sandy road that led to the point of destination. Arriving at the spot where the road made a sudden turn round a ledge of high rocks, within a short distance of the bridge, the party dismounted, with the exception of one to whom the horses were given in charge, with directions to push forward, at a given signal, towards the bridge, for the purpose of receiving his comrades, and any prisoners they might have the good fortune to secure. This done, the captain proceeded cautiously to reconnoitre the premises. We have said there was a guard-house at the south end of the bridge, in which glimmered a light, by the aid of which was seen a sentinel pacing back and forth, with slow and sleepy pace. Sheltered by the reeds that grew on the bank of the river, the party stole along, sometimes knee-deep in mud, until they gained a lodgment under the bridge, where they listened with breathless interest, but heard nothing save the measured footsteps of the sentinel, who was pacing towards the other extremity of the bridge, where he halted, and spoke some words which they could not distinguish. “The sentinel is about to be changed,” whispered the captain, “he will perhaps return once more, and the instant he turns his back, we must spring out and seize him. Have you the gag ready, John?” The sentinel approached, stopped, and listened, while the party under the bridge heard with dismay the neighing of one of their horses, disturbing the dead silence around. After listening a few moments, he walked briskly away towards the guard-house. “Now!” whispered the captain, and in a second the party was on the bridge. In another, they had seized the sentinel, but unfortunately not before he had uttered an exclamation which alarmed the guard, who, the moment they could get ready their arms, sallied forth. This brief interval, however, enabled the soldier to bring up the horses on the signal being given; but before they could mount with their prisoner, the guard was upon them, and discharged a volley, which, though given at random, in the deep obscurity of night, proved fatal to two of the party. The rest retreated while the guard was reloading, which was a work of some difficulty in the pitchy darkness. Quick as thought the prisoner was placed in front of the stoutest of the troopers. “Dash on, boys!” cried the captain, in a faint voice, and on they sped fast as their steeds could go, the old soldier ever and anon urging them forward for their lives and for their country. Scarcely, however, had they proceeded a couple of miles, when he fell headlong to the earth, with the words “Dash on, boys!” trembling feebly on his lips. “They have finished me, John,” said he, as the young man dismounted and knelt by his side. “I've got a bullet in my shoulder. But don't stop for me. Ride on—ride on for your lives—the man you have got may be worth his weight in gold. Carry him to head-quarters, and leave me to my fate. Ride on— away with you!” The men obeyed unwillingly—the old soldier sunk down with the exertion he had made. Here he lay a few minutes without speaking, while John was vainly trying to staunch the blood flowing from his wound with a handkerchief. “Who is that?” said he, faintly. “Your son, dear father.” “What business have you here? Away—leave me—and do your utmost to carry that red coat to head-quarters. You cannot tell what information he may be able to give. It may save thousands of lives— it may save your country. You can do me no good, for I am dying. Go—and may God preserve you.” “Not one step, sir! Live, or die, I will not desert my father!” The wounded soldier raised himself on his elbow, with a last effort, and passionately cried out— “Then, instead of my blessing, take my curse. As your superior officer, I command you—as your father, I adjure you to leave me. With my last breath, I order you to join my men, and do your best to lead them to head-quarters. I am a dead man, and dead men can take care of themselves.” Thus saying, he sunk down, and moved and spoke no more. Rising, after an agonizing struggle, arising from grief for the fate of the brave old soldier, and the necessity of leaving him or incurring his malediction, the bitter tears rolled down his cheeks, and he said to himself—“Here is another item in the price of liberty.” At this moment, he heard the sound of horses crossing the bridge, and kneeling for an instant over the breathless body, he breathed a silent farewell, —a silent prayer for the repose of the soul of his gallant parent—then mounting his horse, spurred forward to overtake his comrades. He had scarcely turned a corner of the road, when a party of dragoons, which had been roused by one of the guard at the bridge, came riding up furiously, and seeing the body of the captain, by the light of the morning dawn, halted to examine it; but finding no signs of life they again pushed forward, to recover, if possible, their kidnapped companion. The fugitives, by this time, were some miles in advance, but being encumbered by their prisoner, did not proceed with the same speed as their pursuers. The moment John overtook them, by tacit consent he assumed the direction of the party. The road led over a succession of hills and valleys, in a devious course, and the daylight disclosed to their pursuers, the party, scampering over a high eminence at a distance of some two or three miles. Descending into a deep vale, they were again lost sight of, and thus alternately hidden, and again in full view, the chase was continued with increasing ardour, if not increasing speed. But it every moment became evident that the pursuers were gaining ground, and that to escape was almost as hopeless, as to halt and fight a party numbering three to one, would be desperate. Nearer, still nearer, appeared the enemy every time they crossed a hill in the rear, and they were now within half a mile, when John and his party descended into a deep valley, which branched off towards the interior of the country, and through which, a stream, sometimes almost dry, at others a roaring torrent, found its way to the Hudson. Being now out of view of their pursuers, a sudden thought occurred to John, which, if put in practice, might possibly secure their escape. Directing his companions to follow, he plunged into the stream, which had been lately swelled by a heavy rain, and had not yet quite subsided, and tracing his course upwards, after the example of the hunted deer, leaving no track behind, he was soon out of sight of the high road. Scarcely had they disappeared, when the enemy gained the summit of the hill overlooking the valley, and missing the fugitives, concluded they had just descended the eminence before them. Shouting with the exultation of certain and speedy success, they spurred on with renewed eagerness, leaving John and his party in the rear, treading the mazes of the winding stream towards its source in a rugged range covered with forests. When certain he was not followed in that direction, and that he was out of their view entirely, he left the channel of the stream, crossed a field or two, and gained a back road that led to the Highlands across Pine's Bridge. In the meantime, the enemy continued the chase over a road which, winding through a hilly country, precluded seeing any considerable distance ahead, until, ascending a high commanding eminence, which afforded a long view of the country before them, they were brought to a full stop by perceiving that the game was nowhere in view. Not a living thing was in sight, nor could they perceive on examination any fresh tracks of horses passing that way. Turning back, they could find no road branching off from that they had travelled, nor any bars or fences thrown down by which the fugitives might have escaped. They must, therefore, have passed them somewhere, and nothing was left but to turn back, and, if possible, discover the precise spot where they had deviated from the road. A scrutiny was accordingly commenced, but without success, from the difficulty of distinguishing the horses' tracks from each other, until it was discovered that one of those belonging to the retreating party was without a shoe to one of his hinder feet, having lost it in the course of the chase. This served them as a sort of landmark, and after a tedious scouting, they at length discovered that the track was lost at the stream, which, as before stated, crossed the deep ravine through which the road passed. It was thus made evident that the chase had taken to the water, and gone eastward, as a contrary direction would have carried them to the river close at hand, and in full view. The pursuit was therefore renewed in that direction with reviving hope, and renovated vigour. They pursued their rough, embarrassed way, following the stream, and carefully searching for the precise point where the fugitives had emerged. This they discovered, after a progress of about half a mile, during which they met with many obstacles, which greatly impeded their course. The state of the fence, which had been pulled down, indicated the spot, and the tracks of the horses led them through some fields, from which they at length passed into a cross-road, where the unshod foot served as an unerring guide. While all this was passing, our hero and his party kept on their way, with all possible speed. But, by this time, their horses began greatly to flag, though they had been selected from the fleetest and strongest of the troop. The necessity of frequently shifting the prisoner from one to another, in order to relieve them alternately, occasioned considerable delays. The men, too, as well as their steeds, required rest and refreshment, and a halt was determined on, whatever might be the consequences. Accordingly, they proceeded to a solitary farm-house, almost hid by a stately old elm, the growth of the primeval soil, which was now slowly putting forth its pale purple buds to the breathing spring. The column of white smoke curling upwards, and floating on the pure atmosphere of morning, gave token that the house was inhabited, and its secluded situation invited the party to choose it as a place of rest, as well as safety, for, it seemed possible, if not probable, that their pursuers might eventually follow their track and overtake them. Every precaution was therefore taken to elude surprise. The horses were kept saddled and bridled, and one of the party, by turns, stood sentinel on an eminence, which commanded a view over the road they had passed, while it hid a like portion of that they were about to pursue. Approaching the house, it presented an aspect of neglect, decay, and desolation, emblematic of these dreary times, when the bayonet lords it over the land, and defenceless weakness, instead of exciting pity, provokes only insult and robbery. An aged female stood peeping fearfully from the corner of a broken window, as if watching their approach, but on entering, not a living soul was to be seen. The room presented a spectacle of poverty; the little furniture it contained was either worn out or broken; the surrounding fields, though blest by nature with the capacity to yield a ready reward to the labours of the husbandman, were without fences, and overgrown with worthless weeds, and neither cattle or domestic animals lowed in the fields, or loitered about the farm-yard. Silence reigned everywhere, but it was not the silence of peace. The crowing of the cock, the cackling of hens, the lowing of the cows, the ploughman's whistle, and the milkmaid's song, and all those rural sounds that give life to the rural prospects, refreshment to the soul of man, were unheard amid the grim repose of nature. John remembered it in past times, when surrounded by a family of lusty boys, and rosy cheeked girls, the old couple, to whom the place belonged, walked on their way contented and happy, and its present aspect smote on his heart. “Another item in the price of liberty,” thought he, as he sighed over the sufferings of his country. As no refreshment could be procured in the absence of the old woman who had been detected at the window, search was made for her, and she was at length found hid under a heap of straw in the cellar. The poor old soul, though her thread of life was almost spun, trembled for the little remnant that was left. “O, for the Lord's sake! for mercy's sake! don't murder a harmless old woman!” exclaimed she, as they drew her forth. 13 “Murder you, mother, what put that in your head?” said John, “we are friends.” “Friends! I have no friends. I am a poor, lone woman, and friends or foes, everybody plunders and insults me. The Cow Boys come here as friends and steal my fowls; the Skinners say they are my friends, and drive away the cattle; and the red-coats and Yagers, after plundering everything they can lay their hands on, break everything they cannot carry away, and then go away cursing me for a rebel. But God's will be done, only don't murder me, gentlemen!” John assured her that they had come as friends, and would treat her as friends. He told her his name, which she remembered, and being thus reassured, she went out for a few moments, and returned leading an old man supporting himself by a stick, and bending under the burden of almost a century of years. A few white hairs lay like strangers at a distance over his wrinkled brow, and his patched garments gave evidence of patient industry contending with extreme poverty. Still his person and his garments were clean, a circumstance more than any other indicating not worthless want, but want incurred by inevitable misfortune. Poverty may be the lot of any man, but dirt is the offspring of sheer idleness, since there is always water enough in the world to keep all the world clean. The beggar with filthy face and hands, gives sufficient evidence that he is himself the author of his own fate. Being told the story of their wants, the old woman bent her way towards a little copse of wood at a short distance, facing a rugged cliff of rocks, within which she disappeared a few minutes, and returned with a supply of potatoes, eggs, and corn-bread. This cliff was the hiding place for all the old couple had left in the world, and to such straits were the poor people who could not remove from the scene of robbery and strife reduced, in order to preserve the scanty means of life. While the humble meal was preparing, John asked a variety of questions, and among others, what had become of their sons and daughters. The question brought the apron of the mother to her eyes, but the old man had long ceased to weep, for he was blind. “Three of our sons,” answered she, “are gone to the army. They may be dead, or they may be living, for it is but seldom we see any one that can tell us what is passing, and men die now-a-days without any body being the wiser for it.” “I saw them not four days ago,” said John, “they were all well, and three better soldiers never drew sword or trigger.” “God reward you for that good news, young man. You shall pay nothing for your breakfast, that's all the thanks I can give you. But my youngest son—he is dead. I know he is dead, for I saw him die.” “Yes,” said the old man, “and so did I. But, thank God, I shall never see such a sight again; that is some comfort.” “You saw him die?” inquired John, who felt interested in the story. “Yes,” replied the old dame, “he died here on this very spot. You can see the stain of his blood on the floor. I have scrubbed and scrubbed to get it out, but whenever the boards are wet, and the sun shines on them, there it comes again, and I can see my poor boy lying with a gash in his head, and the blood running.” “How did he die?” “Why, like a man,” said the graybeard, proudly. “Aye, that's what he did,” cried the mother. “He died trying to save his father's house from plunder, and his old parents from being whipt and spit upon. Well, I will tell you all about it, for it is a comfort to old people to be pitied, and it does one good to let every body know what a fine, bold fellow he was. You must know, sir, he was coming home from the field, the fourth of July, over a year ago, after working hard in a little corn-field we had, till it was quite dark. It was over the hill yonder, out of sight of the house. Well, a party of three Skinners or tories, I don't know which, for one is as bad as the other, had come to the house about an hour before, and after eating and wasting all they could find, began to make a great noise about some liquor to drink. They said they were sure we had some hid away in the house, which was a great big lie, for neither I, or my old man, nor my son, ever drank anything stronger than cider, and we had none of that ever since the Yagers burnt our cider-mill. Well, we had none to give them, and then they began to call us d—d rebels, and all sorts of names, when just then my son come in, and hearing what was going on, spoke to them pretty strong about their conduct. One thing brought on another, and at last they swore that if we didn't give them liquor, they'd tie us all up and give us a whipping.” “The cowardly rascals!” exclaimed John. “Well, then, as I was saying, one thing brought on another—I can't tell how, exactly, I was so frightened—but at last they swore they would `split him like a shad' for his impudence. And so they did. They cut him down on this blessed spot, and hacked him to pieces afterwards. See where they cut me over the arm for trying to save him. But that was not the worst, for they cut my old man just over the eyes in such a way that by degrees he lost his sight, and has never since seen the light of heaven.” “The cowards! the bloody, villainous cowards!” exclaimed John. “Oh! if I ever come across them, if they don't pay dearly for this!” “Well, young man,” said she, “that's very good of you. I don't commonly bear malice, but I own I should like to see—no—not just see, but hear that these cruel men were served as they did my son.” “And I promise you,” said John, “that if I ever meet any of those rascally Skinners, they shall not be the better off for your story, mother. But you must live in hope of better times. It cannot be but such miseries as our dear country has endured, and I fear must still endure, will not be one day repaid by long years of happiness. Liberty, like religion, must have its martyrs, and your son was one of them. It must be—it will be.” “But I shall never live to see it,” replied she. “Nor I. Old men, like me, must look beyond the grave. They have no hope but that of hereafter,” said the old man. “I shall have nothing to live on but the thought of that miserable fourth of July when my poor boy was murdered. It was a bitter day for us.” 13* “But a glorious day for our country—the birth-day of its independence; the beginning of that, whose end, I trust, will be a blessing to mankind. You may not live to see it, but your children, and your children's children will, or there is no virtue in generous blood or fearless patriotism. Think of that, mother, and thank God that you have borne children, who don't fear to die in defence of their country or their parents.” “Do you think we shall ever be free?” asked the good woman, anxiously. “I know it—I feel it—” said John, “for God and Washington are on our side. But where are your daughters?” “They are gone with a bag of corn to mill, for we have no one else to send. It is so far that they are forced to start early to get back the same day.” Here the conversation was cut short by the cry of “Turn out! turn out! the red coats are in sight!” and the sentinel posted on the hill came galloping full speed. All was now haste and confusion. The party mounted, and without bidding farewell, or recollecting their bill, scoured away before their pursuers came in sight, the intervening hills, and a turn in the road, through a thick wood, screening them effectually for the time. The red coats halted at the house, the others had just quitted, for they, too, as well as their horses, were both tired and hungry. The old dame declared truly that she had nothing to give them, and the officer commanding, being fortunately a gentleman, the desolate pair for this time escaped insult and outrage. Unluckily, however, the good woman in her zeal to prove her incapacity to entertain them, let out the secret that all her provisions had been consumed by a party that called that morning. The officer eagerly inquired, how long it was since they departed, and his hope of overtaking them, suddenly reviving, he ordered his men to mount with all speed, and resume the chase. Away, then, they scampered full speed. But John and his party had by this time got the start some miles, and their horses having been refreshed by rest and food, travelled with new vigour. Still the disposal of their prisoner perpetually delayed their progress, and the irregular formation of the country continually enabled them to discern their pursuers, who were again evidently gaining ground. The flight and the chase thus continued, until both parties approached Pine's Bridge, one of the principal passes over Croton river, where John expected to find a detachment from the American army on guard. The horses again began to flag, and the near approach of the eager red coats was announced by shoutings that grew every moment more loud and triumphant. Fifteen minutes more and all had been lost, for when they reached the bridge the enemy was scarce half a mile in the rear. Here they found a company of continentals, to the commander of which our hero said a few words, and rode on as if still fearful of being captured. The officer instantly ordered his men into a thick wood of evergreens, where they had scarce time to conceal themselves, when the pursuing party came in sight, and perceiving the bridge unguarded, dashed across without hesitating a moment. Turning an angle of the road, they were suddenly brought to a halt by the sight of their anticipated prey, drawn up as if waiting to receive them. A parley ensued, in which John roused the indignation of the commander of the red coats by demanding his unconditional surrender. “You are either a madman or an idiot,” cried he, “don't you see we number three to one? Surrender, this instant, or take the consequences.” “Look behind you, sir,” said John, and the officer obeying the intimation, was struck with dismay at seeing a company of regulars drawn up in his rear. John once more, and for the last time, demanded his surrender, and as his situation was such as to preclude all hope of escape, he relinquished his sword with feelings of the bitterest mortification. “You have caught me in a trap,” said he. “Yes,” replied John; “the hunters have become the game, and the game the hunters.” The commandant of the bridge gallantly resigned the prisoners to John, who, he was pleased to say, had fairly earned them by his masterly retreat, and our hero leisurely conducted them to the camp. From the prisoner captured at Kingsbridge, and those at the bridge over Croton river, much valuable information was extracted; and John had the satisfaction at hearing the father of his country regret the fate of his devoted old soldier, while he applauded the conduct of the young volunteer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. A VILLAGE SCENE—MAJOR FORCK AND THE GOVERNOR—A NIGHT ADVENTURE—AND A CATASTROPHE WHICH THREATENS A SPEEDY END TO THIS HISTORY. The campaign was now about to open—that campaign which was to try the stuff, of which men, struggling for freedom, are made. The design we have in view, is not to detail or distort events which belong to history, but to give a domestic picture of a war, the most extraordinary in its character and results, when we consider the means of the respective parties for its prosecution, and its momentous consequences, of any perhaps on record. To judge of it with correctness, it is necessary that the feelings which animated, and the principles that governed and sustained THE People, in their long and arduous struggle, should be known, and these it is our purpose to exemplify in the character and conduct of our hero. Many, very many such ardent, fearless spirits, animated the revolution, who now rest in their graves, unknown and nameless martyrs, who have slipped through the meshes of the net of time, which open the way for all the lesser fry, to the mansions of oblivion. Our hero, having acquired the confidence of his general, was about this period principally employed in discreet and critical emergencies, which required sagacity, promptitude, and intrepidity; such as gaining information of the movements of the enemy, beating up his quarters, and other partisan feats, all which he performed in a manner highly satisfactory. His accurate knowledge of the country between the lines, his cool daring, and his celerity in deciding and executing in a crisis of danger, enabled him to succeed in almost everything he undertook, and to acquire the confidence of one who was slow to trust, and slow to suspect, when he had once given his confidence. On more than one of these occasions he passed within a few miles of Colonel Hammond's residence, and was sorely tempted to deviate from his course, but he resisted the tempter, and bent all the energies of his mind to the service of his country. About this time he was intrusted with a critical and important mission, on which hung the most momentous consequences. It was to meet at or near Spiking Devil, a person from New York, who had been long in the habit of giving information concerning the movements and plans of the enemy, and had signified that he had now something of great importance to communicate to the general. Although the mission not carrying him within the enemy's lines did not involve the character of a spy, yet a disguise was prudent, if not absolutely necessary; and, acordingly, John equipped himself in a suit of beggar's rags, and covering his head with a red wig, defying detection from his most intimate friends, he set forth one evening, a little after dark, on his perilous journey. His course led him to a little village, where was a tavern, kept by a widow, a staunch whig, and one of his old acquaintance. His object was to gain what information he could, and most especially if any small parties of the enemy had been lately seen in that quarter. This house was a favourite resort of a portly, and rather opulent farmer, commonly called Major Forck, although we believe his commission was of his own signing. The major was lofty, pompous, purseproud, and withal a great braggart, especially in his cups. He wore an old fashioned cocked beaver, carried an ivory headed cane, instead of a whip, and rode a stout charger, who possessed certain instincts peculiarly accommodating to a man of the major's convivial propensities. He would mount the steps of a piazza, or enter the door of a house upon occasion, and never failed to carry the major home safe and sound, when the stout old warrior had lost the reins of his understanding, as well as the command of his legs. He was a hale, broad shouldered man, nearly six feet high, with a round, platter face, wide mouth, little pug nose, and diminutive black eyes, that twinkled furiously upon occasion. His constant associate, and determined foe, who assisted him in his cups, irritated and soothed the major alternately, and in fact played him off on all occasions for the amusement of company, was an old inhabitant of the village, a rank tory, suspected of furnishing intelligence to the enemy, and whose situation, surrounded as he was, by whigs, would have been critical, had it not been well understood that he was in fact their protector. His house was in the centre of the town, directly opposite to that of a gentleman, who, having taken a prominent part among the friends of the country, was peculiarly obnoxious to the loyalists, so much so that he had removed his family to a more secure situation, while he himself was serving in the patriot army. They had more than once threatened to fire the old whig mansion, but had as often been dissuaded from it by the opposite tory neighbour, whose house would inevitably have shared the same fate. Thus the village had hitherto escaped, and whenever the old tory, who was a sly humourist, and most pestilent dry wag, was taunted by his neighbours with being an enemy to his country, he would retort upon them by affirming they were a pack of ungrateful rogues thus to abuse their protector and preserver. In short, he took such airs on himself, that he was called, in derision, “the governor,” and by this title he was commonly known in the village, as well as surrounding country. The governor was a perfect contrast to the major, tall, straight, rawboned, and of imperturbable gravity. His jokes were converged in a wink, a shrug, or a sly twist of the mouth, and his skill in first exciting, and then allaying the wrath of Major Forck, was truly admirable. He never lost his temper, and the major never found his. Both were arrant cowards, but the difference was, the major kept his secret, while the governor acknowledged it openly. These two worthies happened to be smoking their pipes at the widow's, when John, as before stated, entered, for the purpose of refreshment, and in the cant of his tribe begged something to eat. The landlady, aware of his identity, received him rather discourteously, but allowed him to take a seat in a corner. He had frequently seen them both, and they were well acquainted with his person before he joined the army. Neither, however, recognized him in his disguise. The major turned up his little snub nose contemptuously, and the governor occasionally looked over his shoulder at him in rather a significant manner. Besides these two dignitaries, there were present two or three of those disinterested persons to be found in every village on the face of the earth, whose sole occupation is to watch people while at work, and to laugh at the jokes of others, though they never perpetrate any themselves. Not being able to afford drinking at their own cost, they were occasionally permitted to partake of the major's bounty, whenever they laughed particularly loud at one of his hits at the governor. “Governor,” said Major Forck, resuming the conversation which had been interrupted by the entrance of the beggar, “any news from down below? You are in the secrets of the red coat general, you know.” Here he winked to his auditors, who gave a significant chuckle. “Tell me, are they bound east, west, north or south.” “They are going to move right perpendicular, as I find by a letter I received from Sir Henry, yesterday.” “Perpendicular? why governor, that's right up and down. I never heard of an army moving that way. But I see what you're at, and if you go to cut any of your dry jokes on me, I'll serve you just as I did the party of Yagers last year; did you ever hear that story?” “What—when you crept up chimney one night and 14 frightened all the swallows? They made such a clatter the Yagers thought it was a troop of horse, and all ran away? If you mean that, I recollect it perfectly. I am sure I should, for I have heard it at least a thousand times.” The major was nettled, especially as the audience all laughed aloud at this sally of the governor. He started up, flourished his cane over the governor's head, and challenged him to mortal combat the next morning. The governor contented himself with standing on the defensive, by lifting his pipe, and mitigating his wrath by an explanation. “Oh! now I recollect. I beg your pardon, Major Forck—by the way, Forck is Dutch for hog. But as I was saying—Forck being Dutch for hog—I believe I was mistaken in the particulars. I recollect, now, it was not the chimney-swallows that frightened the Yagers, it was you, major; yes, I recollect perfectly, it was you.” Here the major, having recovered his serenity, sat down, while the other continued, “Yes— yes—it was you, Major Forck, which, I don't know whether you know it or not, means hog.” “Who cares what it means? Go on with your story, since you pretend to know all about it. I don't suppose anybody else ever heard it before.” The company assured him they had not; whereupon the major treated them to a tipple, and the governor proceeded with great gravity. “Well, as I was saying, you climbed up the chimney as the best mode of putting the Yagers to flight, by setting them an example, and laid hold of a gammon that was hung up there to smoke; but the string not being strong enough for two such fat pieces of bacon—you know Forck is hog in Dutch—gave way, and down you both came, so covered with soot—you know you told me so—that the Yagers took you for the old Harry, and all scampered away. Gentlemen,” added the governor, “this is the true story, and I beg the major's pardon—Forck being, as, I believe, I neglected to observe before, Dutch for hog—for mistaking one story for another. I recollect, it was not then that you frightened the chimney-swallows. Neighbours, I will tell you that story, and be very particular, for it is one of the most brilliant achievements of the whole war.” Here, again, the major started up, flourished his cane, and seemed on the point of annihilating the governor, who, knowing his man, kept his seat, and begged him to listen to his explanation, which he would find perfectly satisfactory. He assured him he would as soon insult King George himself, as Major Forck, though he was sorry to say that Forck was certainly Dutch for hog. “Sit down—sit down,” added he, “and don't be in such a passion—brave men never get angry. Come, sit down, my dear friend hog, —I mean Forck—while I tell these gentlemen, who have never heard the story, as soon as I light my pipe.” Having done this, the governor commenced in the most pompous style of bombast. “One terrible night, in the year—I forget the year, but it certainly happened some time or other—as Major Forck was returning home, about half or three-quarters over the bay—” “It's a lie! I was as sober as a deacon!” exclaimed the major. “Well, as the major was coming home as sober as a deacon—at least, his horse was sober—taking every bush for a Yager, and everything white for a ghost, but being able to see neither bush or Yager if there had been ever so many, he thought he heard the clattering of horses behind him, and naturally concluded, being an old soldier, that if there were horses there must be men on them, and if there were men there must be soldiers, and if there were soldiers there must be enemies. You see, neighbours, the major, whose name is hog in English, was neither tipsy nor frightened, or he would not have reasoned so coolly and judiciously. Now, what do you think the major did? Some people, with more liquor than brains in their noddles, would have stopped, or turned round to ascertain whether their conclusions were right; but the major, being as sober as a deacon, knew which side his bread was buttered, and kept on, right straightforward, full tilt, as fast as his horse could carry him, utterly regardless of meeting his enemies in the rear. Some people may, perhaps, think, the major would have stood a better chance of encountering his pursuers, had he turned his horse's head towards them, but the fact is, all old soldiers, like him, know very well that the shortest way to get into trouble is to run away from it. So the major ran from the enemy that he might meet him the sooner, for he was pretty certain they would follow and overtake him, which was just what he wanted.” “There was a manœuvre for you!” cried the major, triumphantly. “Well, neighbours, the major cut dirt at a great rate, I tell you; and the faster he rode, the nearer the horses' feet seemed to be, which shows that he was taking the most expeditious way of meeting the enemy in the very teeth.” “To be sure,” quoth the major, “let an old soldier alone for that.” “When, at last, the enemy came fairly up with him, such was his warlike appearance, and such mortal defiance flashed from the back of his head, and especially his cocked hat, that though they kept following him, they never could pluck up the courage to draw their swords or fire a pistol. What will scarcely be credited, they quietly left him at his own door, in possession of the field and of all the honours of victory. What renders this affair still more remarkable, the next morning not a single track was to be seen on the road except that of the major's horse, and that there are many envious people among the neighbours, who swear it was his own horse he ran away from, and that he was so far gone that he not only saw but heard double.” It was some time before the major, whose perceptions were naturally somewhat obtuse, perceived the drift of the governor's story; and when, by degrees, he became aware of the joke, the conclusion of which was hailed by bursts of laughter from the auditors, his cheeks were seen to distend with a condensation of mighty indignation, while his little black eyes sparkled with consuming fires. For some time, he could not 14* utter a syllable, but at length a kind of inarticulate gurgling in the throat was succeeded by words. “It's a lie—a bloody lie! Any man that says he ever saw me hear double, or run away from myself, is a liar and a rascal to boot. Come out, if you dare, you tory rascal, meet me in fair fight, like a man, with sword and pistol, and I'll make you eat your words without seasoning, or season them with gunpowder. Follow me, you backsliding, cowardly tory rascal, or I'll break my cane over your head. Come out—come out, I say!” The governor being satisfied with his joke, moved, by degrees, towards the door, while the major followed, flourishing his cane, and watching his opportunity, made a precipitate retreat. Being, however, a better runner than the major, he reached his home in time to bolt the door behind him; whereupon, Major Forck mounted his steed, and riding up the steps of the governor's long piazza, paraded back and forth, denouncing him a liar, a tory, and a poltroon. After this, having satisfied his honour, he bent his course homewards, where he arrived safely, though fast asleep, under the conduct of his discreet charger. The play being over, the audience departed, leaving John, who had become very impatient, alone with the landlady. During the preceding scene, he had remained perfectly quiet, taking no part in the joke, but he could not help observing that the governor occasionally eyed him with a scrutinizing look, which caused some little apprehension that the wily old tory suspected him of not being what he seemed. “Has he come?” asked he eagerly of the landlady. “Not yet. I am afraid all is not right. The governor was down below yesterday, and has been in and out of my house I believe at least a dozen times today, for no reason that I know of, except that he suspects me.” “How late is it?” asked John, again, after a pause, in which he called to mind the sinister looks of the governor. “I don't know—past ten, I believe.” “Then he will not come to-night, and I must make all haste I can to the place of meeting down below.” “Wait a little—something may have delayed him.” “I am afraid the governor suspected me, from his looks.” “You—why your own father would not know you in this wig,” and she sportively snatched it from his head, laughing with great glee at the same time. Unfortunately, however, the governor, who had emerged from his stronghold on the retreat of the major, was watching and listening at the window all this while. He could not distinctly hear what was said, but the moment the landlady pulled off the wig, he retreated precipitately, saddled his horse, and rode off with all speed towards New York. After waiting some time, and finding the person expected did not arrive with his boat from the opposite shore, John determined to proceed on foot to the place appointed for meeting the messenger from the city. The distance was some fourteen or fifteen miles, and it was indispensable that he should be there before daylight. Avoiding the high road, he proceeded onward by a path leading along the bank of the river, and by great exertion arrived at the place of rendezvous, some two hours before daylight. It was just at the junction of the Hudson and Harlem rivers, on the north side, and here he made at intervals the appointed signal, a low whistle, but for a long time no response was made, and no person appeared. He now more than ever feared some untoward accident had occurred to thwart his important mission, and deliberated intensely on the propriety of remaining at the imminent risk of discovery, or return without accomplishing his purpose. Finally, he determined to wait, and take the consequences, whatever they might be. Shrouding himself among the thick evergreens that grew on the bank of the river, he remained perfectly quiet, except ever and anon repeating the signal. No one appeared, none answered, and not a sound disturbed the dread repose that precedes the hour when all animated nature awakes to life and light, save at intervals the challenge of the enemy's sentinels at a distance, and the soft murmuring of the waves on the shore. Anon faint streaks of yellow light gradually shot up athwart the eastern sky; the stars began to wink their eyes, as if overpowered by the radiance of the rising sun, and one by one disappeared like watchful sentinels that had performed their nightly duty, and were now retiring from their posts; the birds of spring began to twitter in their leafy coverts, and at last the distant echoes of the morning gun, reverberated from the high cliffs of the opposite shore, announced that the sun had risen, and the labours of the day commenced. At this moment, and just as John was preparing to return from his fruitless expedition, he saw through the mists that glided like sheeted spectres along the surface of the waters, something stealing along, close to the shore, under the high bank, and weathering a point of rocks projecting into the river, at a little distance towards the south. Again he sought his place of concealment, and stood watching with breathless anxiety the approach of what he soon perceived was a skiff, rowed by a single person, and advancing rapidly towards him. A few minutes more, and the little craft was opposite the spot of his concealment, where it stopped, and the oarsman looked cautiously around in all directions. Thus she lay for a brief period without motion, during which John remained undecided what course to pursue. Being of a nature to risk everything for a great purpose, he hesitated not long, but gave a signal, which was promptly answered, and suddenly the skiff glided into a little cove among the rocks, where it could neither be seen from the river or the land. The person who conducted it then landed, and approached our hero. He was, to all appearance, a plain, substantial citizen, of an open, ruddy countenance, with a clear, blue eye, and an expression of face that invited confidence. He stepped on shore with the caution of a cat seeking to ensnare a bird in the grass, and his glance quick as lightning continually ranged towards every point of the compass. With all this, as he approached, he discovered nothing like fear, but on the contrary, a perfect self-posession. “You are late, friend,” said John, in a low tone. “I could not come sooner,” repeated the other, in a whisper. “I am afraid they begin to suspect me, for all day yesterday soldiers have been loitering about my house, and asking idle questions, that seem to have no meaning. They called for liquor, too, and drank freely in sight of officers passing by, though I know it is against a standing order.” “Have you brought any important information?” “Yes, very important. An officer of considerable rank, but who sometimes gets into a frolic, was at my house night before last, and while swaggering about, more than half drunk, dropt a paper from his pocket, which I secured without notice, and after copying, went and delivered to Sir Henry next morning. It contains the general order which will be published in a few days, and details the course of operations at the opening of the campaign.” After looking about cautiously in every direction, he slipped into John's hand a silver bullet, which he said contained the information to which he referred, and of which he enjoined him to be careful. “It is a dangerous business you are engaged in, my friend,” said John, “but I suppose you are well paid for it.” “Nothing can pay a man for such a task as I have undertaken. I don't pretend to be better than other people, but believe me, it is not money alone that tempts me to risk my life every day, every hour, and every minute. I love money, I confess, but I love my country better, and liberty still more. The way I choose to serve them both, I know is not considered honourable; but if it is glorious to risk one's life for our country, surely it is more so, to incur both the loss of life and reputation in her cause. I expect that I shall some day or other die with disgrace on my name, but am willing to do so whenever I am called.” “You are a true friend to your country, and I honour you with all my soul,” said John, shaking him warmly by the hand, “but we must not be loitering here. I shall set forth immediately on my way, while you return to New York.” “I shall not return till night; it is too late now. Let us draw up the skiff into the thick bushes yonder, where she will not be seen. I have some provisions with me, and shall remain here quiet till evening. But the sooner you are gone the better; so make haste, and if you can, travel like a mole under ground.” At this moment, a rustling was heard among the bushes, and the next, a party of red coats rushed upon them in the rear. Quick as thought, John hurled the silver bullet from him with all his might out into the river, where, after a few skips along the surface, it disappeared. Defence was vain, for they were without arms, and surrounded on all sides. The commanding officer ordered them both to be seized and bound, swearing he would soon find out the reason of their skulking so near the lines, pretending to be skipping stones in the river. “As for you sir,” addressing the stranger, “we've had our eyes on you for some time. You are from the city. You came away last night in a boat, and unless you can give a good account of yourself, you may chance to swing for it, as well as this red-haired beggar, who we know is in disguise.” Saying which, he pulled off our hero's wig, amid a general titter of the whole party. “I can give a good account of myself,” was the quiet response of the stranger. “Very well, so much the better for you. As for you, Mr. Rebel, we know you of old. You are the gentleman who sliced a few Yagers not long ago, and afterwards carried off one of our sentinels. You see, I know all about you. Though not a beggar, I assure you, you are an object of charity, for you'll swing by the side of your worthy friend there, as sure as I am one of his majesty's serjeants.” When a man is caught in disguise, whatever may be his motives, he is apt to look rather sheepish. Such was the case with our hero, who remained silent, simply because he did not know exactly what to say for himself. His heart was heavy, for he felt that his country might suffer new calamities from the failure of his undertaking. This was his first thought; his second was of Jane, whom now he never expected to see more: for though he knew that not having been within the lines of the enemy, he could not be considered a spy, still he was perfectly aware that few American prisoners ever escaped alive from the fangs of old Cunningham, whose name is consecrated to eternal infamy in our domestic traditions, or from the fatal dungeons of the prison-ships, where so many nameless patriots died for their country and were forgotten. The prisoners were roughly hurried to the nearest post of the enemy, whence they were carried before the commander-in-chief for examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. A PICTURE OF A SUBJUGATED CITY—AN EXAMINATION—A LOVE-SICK MAIDEN AND A TESTY PARENT—A DIALOGUE— AND A SORTIE OF THE OLD CONTINENTAL. After undergoing a thorough search without anything being discovered which could throw light on their mission, the two prisoners were conducted under guard to the city. As they passed along, the island presented a melancholy picture of neglect and desolation. The fields and gardens were without fences, and without cultivation; the woods had been all cut down to supply the enemy with fuel, and many of the houses deserted. Every object indicated, that the few remaining inhabitants neither sat down under their own vine and their own fig-tree, nor enjoyed unmolested the fruits of their labours. A stern enemy lorded it over the land, and no one could call that his own, which he had earned by the sweat of his brow, or inherited from his fathers. As they entered the subjugated city, which John well remembered as the abode of competence and peace, he was struck with the sad contrast it now presented. Many of the inhabitants had left it, on being taken possession of by the enemy, and of those 15 that remained, but few became reconciled to their new masters, who neither sought to conciliate their love, or to disguise that haughty contempt with which the conqueror almost always looks down on a subjugated people. Citizens and soldiers, even of the same country, scarcely ever associate cordially together, though the latter appear in the character of protectors and defenders; but when, on the contrary, they come as conquerors and oppressors, nothing can be expected but injuries and insults on one hand; on the other, hatred and revenge. The conspicuous red coats everywhere appeared, swaggering through the streets with an air of superiority that was in itself a perpetual insult; and to complete the picture, a large portion of the city lay in ruins, having not yet recovered from the effects of the great fire, that took place soon after it fell into the hands of the enemy. Passing down Broadway, the prisoners at length arrived at the head-quarters of Sir Henry Clinton, at the Battery. They had been prevented from all communication with each other, and were separately brought before the general, who was attended by some of his principal officers. The examination was long, and every art and every threat was used to entrap them into a discovery or extort confession. But all these efforts failed, for both were sustained by equal firmness and self-possession. When asked whether he belonged to the rebel army, he replied, that he was one among three millions of people who were struggling for their rights, and that if a whole nation could be called rebels, he certainly was one. When charged with being a spy, he denied it, respectfully, but firmly. He acknowledged that he came for the purpose of seeking information as to the condition of the British forces and their probable destination, but having never come within their lines, until brought there a prisoner, he could not be called a spy, and therefore claimed the rights due to a captive in war. As to his meeting with the person with whom he had been found, whom he had never seen before, and from whom he had derived no information, he conceived, as they had no right to inquire, he was not bound to answer. He was found where he had a right to be, and had a right to wear what clothes he pleased. His companion was more closely questioned, for his conduct had been still more suspicious than that of our hero, and the commander-in-chief had more than once had occasion to suspect that his contemplated movements had been betrayed in a manner for which he could not account. But every attempt to entrap the stranger was met or evaded with such consummate art and address, that nothing could be got out of him which could possibly commit himself or his associate. Without a single falsehood on his part, he so managed, that John could corroborate his statements without any breach of veracity, and the general could find no other charge substantiated against him, but that of having left the city at night in defiance of general orders; and this, he being merely a citizen, was not an offence of such magnitude as to call for the exercise of the utmost severity of military law. He was finally committed to the custody of the provost-marshal, and, with his companion, separately confined in the old sugar-house, in what is now called Liberty-street, there to undergo the discipline of the immortal Cunningham, that petty tyrant, whose name is forever associated with all that is odious and contemptible in man. Thus they escaped a sudden death, for a lingering series of privations of every kind, accompanied by insults which gave new aggravations of mind to their bodily sufferings. Having now accommodated our hero with board and lodging, we shall turn our attention to another quarter. After the departure of John, his mistress remained in the usual state of young damsels in love, during the lingering hours of absence, only that her situation was more than usually trying. Solitude is the nurse of the heart, and all its most tender recollections, and Jane lived alone, in a sequestered, almost deserted region, which afforded not even the material for a flirtation, for there was nothing in the shape of a rustic Lubin, or sentimental schoolmaster, in twenty miles round. It was, therefore, a matter of absolute necessity, that she should be constant to one object, and constancy is an unnatural state of mind, a sort of monomania, inconsistent with all the analogies of nature and the world, which exhibit nothing but a perpetual succession of changes. She had neither balls, nor concerts, nor lectures, nor soirees, nor any gay associations to dissipate her mind, or charm her heart away from one single contemplation; and even the church, that never-failing resource of rural lads and lasses, was now without its pastor and its flock. Her only companion at the fireside, was a whimsical and somewhat testy old continental; her only associates abroad, were the birds, the blossoms, and the running brooks; and her only occupation, was the easy cares of a quiet household. The library of the colonel afforded little resource, consisting, as it did, principally, of a couple of folio volumes, a century old, in which were concentrated all the discoveries and inventions, good, bad, or indifferent, with which the pack-horse world had been saddled since the days of Archimedes, or Tubal Cain, for aught we know to the contrary, by visionary enthusiasts, cheating rogues, and profound philosophers. It was a perfect mine of inexhaustible treasures, and the colonel was in the habit of asserting, with what truth we know not, that nearly all the new discoveries in science or art, within his time, were nothing more than old broken-down hobby-horses, that had been tried and abandoned long years ago. There was, however, no invention for shortening the long, lingering hours of absence, or bringing together two distant lovers, and for that reason Jane never opened these precious depositories, from whence, the colonel affirmed, were stolen all modern inventions except his own. Thus she continued a long while, without having any news of John, for the post never passed in that direction, nor did the newspapers circulate among the depths of the forests, whereby, as it is credibly asserted, the very squirrels and coons have of late become almost as wise as their hunters. Nay, it is affirmed, there is no crow so silly as to be circumvented by a fox, and that no trap, however scientifically devised, can inveigle a rat or mouse of ordinary sagacity, even by the aid of toasted cheese, or broiled bacon. It is, indeed, the age of development, and if the human 15* intellect does not burst by its own expansion, like the frog in the fable, there is great reason to hope we shall in good time become as wise as our grandmothers. The only thing to be apprehended, is, that knowledge, by the aid of cheap literature, will become universal; in which case, it will depreciate in value as fast as continental money. When all mankind are wise, and all pebbles become diamonds, it will, belike, be all one, as though all wise men were fools, and all diamonds pebbles. There was, however, no danger of Jane ever becoming wise, for she lived previous to, or just at the dawning of the age of development, before the revival of phrenology and animal magnetism, and consequently friend John was a lucky stripling. There was not a circulating library, we believe, within the distance of three thousand miles, and how Jane learned to love without drinking at that fountain, is a mystery only to be solved by Dame Nature. Thus was our unfortunate heroine utterly destitute of all those resources against the monopoly of the heart, which are now within reach of our kitchen-maids. She had nothing to do, but mind her business and think of John. Thus passed her time, and thus it might have continued to pass, had not the jade, Rumour, taken upon herself the office of mails and newspapers, and blown her trumpet, to the infinite disturbance of that monotonous calm into which Jane had gradually subsided. No one could tell where the news came from, or who first bruited it abroad; but so it was, that the colonel, having stopped at a blacksmith's shop on one of his excursions, was told of the sudden disappearance of our hero from the army in the Highlands—of his being seen in the disguise of a beggar, with a red wig, at the village before noticed—and of his never having been seen or heard of since that time. The general impression of the army, it was said, was, that he had deserted to the enemy, and that his disguise had been assumed for that purpose. By way of a secret, we will apprise the reader that the news first came from Mangham, the pedlar, who had been in the Highlands on a speculation, and passed, a few days before, on his way to New York, or its neighbourhood, to replenish his pack. It was a great mystery, but certain it is, the pedlar was a sort of privileged person, and, like the ancient heralds, had free admission everywhere, though we never heard that his person or his function was considered sacred. The old continental was one of those vessels which, whenever they are full, overflow incontinently for want of the self-balancing principle. A secret that was painful or disagreeable to his own feelings, very soon escaped, like a locust from its shell, and accordingly the moment he saw his daughter on his return home, he began to launch his thunderbolts at John. Jane, of course, eagerly inquired what he meant, and received the news of her lover's supposed delinquency with mingled doubt, indignation, and sorrow. Every day, however, brought new confirmation; and, in the meantime, hearing nothing from our hero, she was compelled to believe all that she heard from others was true. No one can tell what might have been the consequence of this conviction of his unworthiness, had not the vision of the beggar and his red wig, ever and anon crossed her imagination, and thus, in some degree, superseded the image of her recreant swain. She thought how ugly he must have looked, the degenerate wretch! thus to present himself to the red coats in such an ignominious disguise! What would they think of her taste, thus to fall in love with such a fright? There is no danger of young maidens dying for love, when their minds are occupied by two objects at a time, such as a handsome young fellow, with blue eyes, and chestnut hair, and a ragged tatterdemalion in a red wig. But when a single object or impression becomes indelibly impressed on the heart, to the exclusion of all others; when it plays the tyrant alone and absolute, then it is that the fatal poison works without its antidote, and that its venom becomes fatal. It was fortunate, therefore, for our heroine, that there was a certain confused intermixture in her recollection or imagination, of a ragged beggar and a handsome youth, which prevented her constantly dwelling on the latter. She was thus enabled to bear up against the first shock; and when, by degrees, the image of her lover, such as she alone remembered to have seen him, took once again full possession of her recollection, time had assuaged the first bitterness of sorrow, and contempt and indignation enabled her to bear what remained. True, the laughing eye, the ruddy cheek, the smile of careless hilarity, the look of cheerful hope, the tripping step, and all the elastic spirit of youth, had given place to a pale and sad sobriety. Still, she did not abandon herself to grief, nor forget for a moment, that, in pouring the balm of consolation into the hearts of others, she was applying the most effectual remedy to her own. The old continental, we are compelled to say, behaved very ill on this occasion. Instead of sympathizing with the stricken deer, he often assisted in barbing the dart already rankling in her bosom. There are some persons, who, not being capable of lasting impressions of sorrow, always feel impatient at the very sight of continued grief or depression on the part of others, and instead of sympathy, resort to reproaches. It was thus with the colonel, who could not endure to see his child so changed, nor could he sympathize with the cause. His usual resource was rather to outrage the feelings of his child by anger, than sooth them by pity. He could not bear to see her so changed, nor could he participate in her depression. The old gentleman, accordingly, vented his spleen in divers sneers, inuendoes, and reproaches, occasionally not a little aggravated by the failure of some one of his favourite inventions. As he could not revenge himself on his contrivances, he fell into a passion with poor Jane; for nothing is more common with poor human nature than to retort on honest Peter the offences of Paul the rogue. Jane used frequently to stroll over to the old stone house, but received little consolation there. Though happily for the human race, our feelings and sympathies partake in the dulness of the senses produced by age; yet are its sorrows without the solace of the inspiring hope of better times in this world. The aged must look beyond the grave for the rising sun, since they cannot expect to survive its setting here. The old couple were mourning with Christian resignation the death of their only son, and the disgrace of their only grandson, and though their grief was silent, it was not less deep and lasting. The visits of Jane were now almost their only worldly consolation, for they saw she sympathised with them, and to be pitied is one of the greatest consolations of stricken age. One evening, she had returned from a visit of this kind, more than usually depressed and sorrowful. She took her seat in silence, and in silence sat leaning her cheek upon her hand, and giving up her whole soul to bitter recollections. The old continental, in the meantime, was observing his daughter, until at length he could contain himself no longer. In a voice that made the poor girl start and tremble, he suddenly exclaimed: “Thunder and Mars! Jane, what are you moping about? you look for all the world as though you could'nt help it.” “Father, I cannot help it,” said Jane, bursting into tears. “Yes—I know what it is. Your head is running on that good-for-nothing, beggarly, cowardly deserter, John. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for thinking about such a scoundrel, except to hate and despise him.” “Father, I don't know, I don't believe him a deserter. He loved his country, and he loved me too well to desert one, or give up the other. He is either dead or a prisoner, my heart tells me so. You know, sir, it is nothing but a rumour, that came from no one knows where.” “Pooh! pooh, girl! I dare say, if our country finally loses the day, you will see him come home in a British uniform, with a pair of evauletts on his shoulders, and catch you as they do gudgeons, with a red rag. You will forgive him, but by all that is sacred, I never will.” “Father,” said Jane, firmly, “you don't know me, if you think so. No, father—if ever I am convinced beyond room for doubt, that is, by my own eyes, or his own acknowledgement, that he has deserted his country, from that hour he shall be to me nothing but an object of contempt and scorn. I will tear him from my heart as I would a poisoned arrow.” The colonel's eyes twinkled a little at this, but people who indulge a habit of being angry, don't always choose to be pleased against their will, and he relapsed into his crusty humour. “Yes—yes—it is very easy to talk; but the moment he appears in his red coat, you will fall in love with it, and forgive everything. The young rascal! that ever I should be such an old blockhead as to promise him my only daughter, my estate and my improvements. But the fellow might have imposed upon a wiser man than me, if such a one is to be found. He'd signalize himself, he'd make himself worthy of being my son-in law—he'd make his name ring! Thunder and Mars! he has kept that last promise, for it is now ringing with infamy in the camp of Washington. Zounds, I'd go twenty miles to see him hanged or shot.” “Father, dear father! do not talk so to me. You should not bear too hard upon the bruised, broken reed. I am struggling day and night to bear up against the wretched uncertainty of John's fate. I believe him innocent; but if I were sure he was a traitor to his cause, I should soon be well again, and happy But do not harrass, do not reproach, and above all, do not ridicule me, because I am not what I once was. In all my troubles, you cannot say I have ever neglected my duty to you; and if I can now no longer cheer you with song and smiles, nothing, not even your unkindness, shall take from you my love and reverence. Take me to your arms, and bless me!” Saying this, she crept softly towards the old man, with a look so meek, so mournful, yet affectionate, that his tough, weather-beaten heart melted, and his wrath exhaled like dew-drops of a sunny morning. He opened his arms, pressed her to his heart, and exclaimed with glistening eyes: “Forgive your old father, dear Jane; damme if you may'nt be as miserable as you please, and welcome.” “Thank you, dear father!” answered the grateful girl, and a long silence ensued, during which the colonel was stretching his lame leg by walking back and forth, with his hands behind him, apparently communing with his thoughts. At length he stopped abruptly opposite Jane, and broke forth as follows: “Jane, I've a great mind—yes I will—Thunder and Mars! I will, I'll see into the truth of this affair. The army has not yet left the Highlands, and to-morrow I will go and call on the general, to learn if possible whether that young puppy has deserted or not. I know something of the stratagems of war, and now I think of it, John may have put on the beggar's dress and that infernal red wig, to serve, not to betray his country. What a blockhead I was not to think of this before. Yes, I'll go—Thunder and Mars! I'll go.” “Oh! thank you, dear father, for that promise and that hope!” cried Jane, throwing her arms about his neck, and kissing him. “Only get at the truth—I do not fear the truth.” The old continental forthwith summoned his man of ebony, yelept Mingo, and ordered him to prepare his trusty charger, old Ti, and his fellow-laborer, Black Pepper, for a journey on the morrow. Moreover, he directed him to draw his regimentals forth from their dread abode, beat them soundly with a stick or switch, and hang them out bright and early in the morning for an airing. Finally, he commanded Ebony, who had been his squire during the old French war, to dust his ancient livery that he might not disgrace his commander. This resolution of the father brought balm to the bosom of the daughter, where lurked, beyond the reach of reason or probability, a latent conviction, founded on an intimate communion of years, that the youth of her pride and affections was still worthy the place he had so long occupied. That night brought with it visions of happier times, and she rose in the morning with the sun, and almost as bright as he. The breakfast was more cheerful than for a long while past, but they were disturbed in the midst of it, by the abrupt entrance of Mingo, who, in great consternation, announced that the colonel's regimentals were so completely riddled by moth as to be totally unfitted for service. “Dem look jis like a sive, colonel. You see daylight trough em like nottin.” “Thunder and Mars! Jane, it's all your fault. You've not aired them ever since you began a flirtation 16 with that puppy, John. I've a great mind not to stir a foot.” Jane made the best excuses she could, and threw out something like an insinuation that it was Mingo's business to attend to the regimentals; whereupon the old continental ran a tilt against his squire, accusing him of being a lazy old caterpillar. “Thunder and Mars! sir! you should have sprinkled them with snuff, or covered them with tobacco. Have not I bought ever so many pounds of both, and given them to you for that very purpose? But I suppose you have snuffed and smoked it all yourself, you old snow-ball.” Jane, now seeing the storm directed against Mingo, assumed the entire responsibility of the business, though she refrained from giving the true reason of her neglect. The colonel's uniform was that of the old provincial troops, as they were called, which was a blue coat, and scarlet waistcoat and breeches, trimmed with silver lace. Now the truth is, Jane was such a sturdy little rebel, she could not bear to see him even partially dressed in a colour she now held in abomination, and for this reason she had wilfully delivered the colonel's regimentals to the custody of the moth. She also abstained from reminding him that he might possibly be mistaken for a British officer, lest he should abandon the expedition in disgust. On examination, however, it was discovered that the case was not so desperate as Mingo had reported, and in good time, the old continental and his faithful squire were equipped for the journey. Old Ti and Black Pepper were then brought forth, caparisoned in their best, and all things being in readiness, the knight and his attendant sallied forth in gallant array, followed by the good wishes and prayers of the grateful daughter, now left in solitary loneliness to the indulgence of her fears and her anticipations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE COLONEL'S ORDER OF MARCH—MUTINOUS CONDUCT OF OLD MINGO—THE COLONEL INFLICTS MARTIAL LAW ON HIM— CONSTERNATION OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, DUCKS, PIGS, AND CHICKENS—UNHEARD OF EXPLOIT AT PINE'S BRIDGE— HONOURS PAID THE COLONEL—SUCCESSFUL ISSUE OF HIS MISSION, AND HAPPY RETURN. The distance between the residence of Colonel Hammond and the Highlands, was not more than some five-and-twenty miles, and might easily have been compassed in a summers' day by ordinary equestrians. But neither the colonel or his squire were in the heyday of youth, and their steeds would never have won a heat at the Union course. They were a pair of sleepy animals, somewhat better fed than taught; for, being great pets of Mingo, they had been pampered, stuffed, and curry-combed, till they grew as fat as an alderman, and as sleek as moles. The colonel was a short, square-built man, so that when mounted on his broad-backed charger, his legs were utterly incapable of spanning the wide circumference, but, on the contrary, projected somewhat horizontally from the seat of gravity. Mingo was a little, squat, native African, black and shining as anthracite coal, and at the same time deeply pitted with the smallpox. But he had the advantage of the colonel in one particular, his legs, being of the extreme order of bandy, so that when he sat his horse, they fitted the animal's sides just as well as his own ribs, and clung as close as a circingle. Add to this, that the day, particularly the mid-day, was somewhat sultry, and it will readily be imagined that the progress of our adventurers was somewhat slow and easy. The journey was rendered more tedious by the absence of all conversation, the military etiquette of the colonel not permitting Mingo to approach within a certain distance in the rear, which the latter, from time immemorial, had been accustomed to ascertain, by counting the lengths, as they are called, of the rail fences by the roadside. Mingo, by this means, managed to preserve his distance until they came to a long stone wall, where he was observed to waver very materially, and severely reprimanded accordingly. It is well known to be the instinct of all gentlemen of colour to fall asleep when they have nothing else to do, and Mingo, after a ride of some ten or a dozen miles, paid a visit to the land of Nod, according to the custom of his ancestors. Thereupon, his steed, having been used to amble side by side with his old comrade in harness, incontinently gathered himself together, and fidgeted up close beside the colonel, greeting his old messmate with a significant chuckle of welcome. “Thunder and Mars! you old sinner, what business have you here?” exclaimed the indignant continental. Mingo replied not, except by a snort; other answer made he none, for he continued to sleep like a top. 16* The indignation of the colonel kindled into a flame. He invoked all his energies, and would have raised himself in his stirrups, had not the oblique direction of his legs forbid, in like manner with the furious knight of La Mancha, when preparing to annihilate the valiant Biscayner. He grasped his cane, which he always rode with, and permitting the squire to precede him a single step, planted a blow with such judicious precision on his broad shoulders, that a cloud of dust ascended therefrom, and he awoke, as if by miracle, rubbing his eyes and twisting his body in a very significant manner, exclaiming at the same time— “Hey! what de debbil dat?” “I'll tell you what de debbil dat, you sleepy old varmint. What business have you to come alongside of me in this way, as if you were my equal, hey?” “Why, massa, we all fightin for libbety and quality, ant we? But howsomever, you let me talk, I no sleep. Nigger mus do sumtin keep hisself awake.” “You old rascal, didn't I order you to keep the length of six rails in the rear?” “Ees, massa, but dis dam stone fence—he bodder me. I gwine to count stones, and den, ecod, massa, nigger go fast 'sleep—dat's all. I no do so 'gin, caze why, my back put me in mind, I reckon.” “Very well—fall back in the rear, and march on, you mutinous old rascal. If you come alongside again, Thunder and Mars! I'll pay you over that stupid woolly head, instead of your shoulders.” Mingo gave his shoulders a sympathetic shake, fell in the rear, and they again proceeded forward. It was fortunate for the colonel that the country through which they passed, was, in a great measure, destitute of male inhabitants, or his colonial uniform might have cost him a shot from behind a tree or a stone wall. Occasionally they passed a house occupied by women and children, the father and grown up sons having gone to the wars; and whenever this happened, there was an alarm that the red coats were coming, for they were ever accustomed to associate the colour of the colonel's waistcoat and breeches with the presence of an enemy, and the leisurely pace of the old continental induced a belief that he was at the head of a party in the rear. Accordingly, the whole line along the road was in a state of alarm; mothers sought refuge in their accustomed hiding-places; children vanished like shadows; while the ducks, pigs, and chickens decamped from pure instinct. Such was the feeling of the women of this region, in these lawless times, when the sight of man, instead of inspiring confidence, was too often the prelude to insult, violence, and plunder. Our travellers, betimes, approached the pass of Pine's bridge, where was stationed a guard of republican soldiers. The colonel stiffened himself, assumed the perpendicular, and giving old Ti a thwack across the ears with his cane, which caused him to shake his head in disgust, trotted gallantly forward towards the bridge. His appearance at a distance had puzzled the officer of the guard, who mistook his scarlet waistcoat and breeches for a full British uniform, and expected every moment to see a party of the enemy following. He accordingly ordered his men to be called together by beat of drum, while the old continental, turning to Mingo, exclaimed— “Now, Mingo, you shall see. They are preparing to receive me with military honours.” As he planted his first hoof on the bridge, the officer called out in a loud voice— “Hollo, my friend, where are you bound?” at the same time, his men pointed their guns in a significant manner. “Sing out, massa, or, ecod, dey shoot you,” said Mingo. “To head-quarters,” answered the colonel. “Do you come with a flag?” “No.” “Have you a pass?” “Thunder and Mars! don't you know my uniform?” “Not I, faith. What corps do you belong to?” “To the New York regiment of continentals, that served in the old French war. My name is Hammond—Colonel Hammond.” “I don't know any such regiment, nor any such uniform.” “Thunder and Mars! did you never hear of old Ti?” “Old Ti? Not I.” “Why, where in the name of old Harry were you born, and where have you lived?” “No matter. What is your business at head-quarters?” “None of your business, sir!” “That won't do, old gentleman. You are without a pass. Your uniform is half British, half American, and you refuse to give any account of yourself. You are my prisoner, sir, and I shall send you under a guard to head-quarters. You may be a spy, for aught I know.” “A spy! Thunder and Mars!—a spy! I'll teach you to insult as good a whig as the mother that bore you, or any of your generation. Mingo, follow me!” The old continental thereupon drew forth his trusty and rusty sword, and pricking forward old Ti, while he flourished his weapon, gallantly passed the officer, who, seeing what an original he had to deal with, suffered him to take his way while he stood shaking with laughter. The guard, in like manner, at a signal from the officer, respectfully opened for the colonel to pass, so that, as he long afterwards was accustomed to boast, he fairly carried the bridge sword in hand. The officer, who had followed close in the rear, now courteously addressed him, stating that his rank and achievements forbade that he should be permitted to travel with a single attendant through a district where he was exposed to such unpleasant interruptions. He therefore respectfully proffered the attendance of three of his men, as a guard of honour, to head-quarters. This he conceived to be the most peaceable mode of disposing of one, whose appearance, conduct, and discourse, buffled all his sagacity. Whether a humourist, a madman, or a consummate deceiver, he could not decide, and therefore adopted that mode of disposing of his conqueror. Thus honoured, the old continental pursued his journey without further adventures, entertaining his escort with his exploits at old Ti, occasionally regretting that, like most of his compeers in arms, he was now past serving his country, and lamenting, with perfect simplicity, how unfortunate it was there were so few good officers in the present continental army. In the midst of these sage discourses, they arrived at Peekskill, in the dusk of the evening, where the colonel requested they might halt for the night, as he felt somewhat fatigued with his exploit at the bridge, and his pursy steeds could now scarcely put one foot before the other. His wish was complied with, and, as a special mark of honour, a sentinel kept guard all night at the door of his chamber. “You see, you old snow-ball,” said the colonel, proudly, “you see I am somebody among soldiers, though nobody at home. Thunder and Mars! a prophet has no honour in his own country.” Mingo grinned enormously at this sally, having sufficient shrewdness to see through the whole affair; but he held his tongue for fear of another application to his shoulders. Early in the morning, they entered the pass of the Highlands, and the colonel was conducted by his guard of honour to the quarters of the commander-in-chief. Far be from us the presumption of attempting to portray or caricature the face, person, and deportment of the illustrious man, to whose presence the colonel was now, at his earnest request, conducted. The severe simplicity of his character—the natural, unaffected dignity of his deportment—the beautiful symmetry which blended all his great qualities and virtues in one harmonious whole—while it constitutes the perfection of our nature, will forever defy the presumption of those who attempt to portray either his person or his character. Washington was no hero of romance, and his name associates but illy with fiction. It is too sacred for such profanation; and he, of all the great characters on record, least requires the aid of the imagination to do justice to his fame. There is scarcely a house in the land, where his picture is not hung up to the contemplation of our children; there is not a heart in the land that does not throb with gratitude at the recollection of his name; and there is not a page in the history of independent America, written, or to be written, that will not in some way or other, bear testimony to the benefits derived from his services and his example. Let not the mists of fiction gather around him, and change a consummate man into a misshapen monster. Let him be enshrined in the pure white mantle of truth, for truth alone can do him justice. Suffice it to say, the mission of the colonel ended perfectly to his satisfaction. Under a pledge of profound secrecy, the reason for which our readers will readily comprehend, the object of our hero's disguise, and the cause of his disappearance, were fully explained. The colonel further learned that John was now a prisoner, but where, and under what circumstances, remained unknown, as since his capture, and that of the person who met him at Spuyten Duyvel, the difficulty of obtaining information from New York had greatly increased. The general did full justice to his ardour, intelligence, courage, and patriotism; and the old continental, after dining at head-quarters, and talking about Braddock's war, was dismissed under a firm conviction that the goddess Rumour was no better than an almanac. He returned home without the necessity of again carrying Pine's bridge sword in hand; astounded Jane with the relation of that famous exploit, which he insisted on before he would say a word of John; and finally, gladdened her inmost soul by detailing the testimony of the general. She acquiesced with lowly humility in his imprisonment, for that might have an end; but the brand of a traitor could never be effaced, and though he might die under its stigma, he could never live for her. For a time, her smiles and cheerfulness returned; and when, on the return of spring, the birds sung, the flowers bloomed, and the zephyrs whispered among the green leaves, she could sympathise in the joyousness of nature.
