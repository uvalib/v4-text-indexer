      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Dear scenes of bliss! by fancy given, To cheat the enraptur'd, gazing eye. Say why, alas! ye promise Heaven, And give but disappointment's sigh? Ah, early years! ye wake my sorrow— Now slowly moves the tedious day, While sombre shades o'ercloud the morrow, And shroud the sun's declining ray. Mrs. Rose. The spring opened with the “dreadful note of preparation” throughout America for defensive war. It was found that vigorous measures must be pursued to oppose the torrent which was preparing to overwhelm the colonies, soon to be for ever separated from the British empire by the Declaration of Independence. Troops were levying in all parts of the continent, and great numbers of American youth volunteered in the service of their country. A large army of reinforcement was shortly expected from England to land on our shores, and “the confused noise of warriors and garments rolled in blood,” were already anticipated. Haventon had received a commission in a regiment of militia, and was pressed by several young gentlemen of his acquaintance who had entered the army to join it also. He had an excuse: his father was a man in extensive business, was considerably past the prime of life, had a number of agents and clerks under him, but began to grow unable to attend to the various and burdensome duties and concerns of a mercantile life. Alonzo was his only child; his assistance therefore became necessary until at least his father could bring his business to a close, which he was now about to effect. He stated these facts to his friends, told them that on every occasion he should be ready to fly to the post of danger when his country was invaded, and that soon as his father's affairs should be settled he would, if necessary, willingly repair to the field. The day now rapidly approached when Haventon was to make Miss Bloomfield his own. Preparations for the mystic ceremony were VOL. II. A 2 making, and invitations had already gone abroad. Edgar, the brother of Melissa, had entered the army in the capacity of chaplain; he was soon expected home, where the intended to tarry until the consummation of the nuptials before he set out for the camp. Letters recently received from him announced his intentions to this effect. About three weeks previous to the appointed marriage day, Alonzo and Melissa one afternoon rode out to the village which had been chosen for their future residence. Their carriage stopped at the only inn in the place, and from thence they walked around this modern Vacluse, charmed with the secluded beauties of its situation. They passed a little time at the spot selected for their habitation; they projected the structure of the buildings, planned the gardens, the artificial groves, the walks, the meads, the fountains, the green retreat of the summer-house, and they already saw in anticipation the various domestic blessings and felicities with which they were to be surrounded. After taking tea at the inn, they prepared to return. It was the latter end of the month of May, and nature was adorned in the bridal ornaments of spring: the sun sank behind groves which cast their sombre shades over the valley, while the retiring beams of day adorned the distant eastern eminences with yellow lustre: birds sang melodiously in the forest: the air was freshened by light western breezes, bearing upon their wings all the intrancing odours of the season: around the horizon electric clouds raised their brazen summits, based in the black vapour of approaching night. They slowly ascended the hill south of the town, where they paused a few moments to enjoy the splendours of the evening scene. This hill which commanded a prospect of all the surrounding country, the distant Sound, and the adjacent towns and villages, presented to the eye on a single view perhaps one of the most picturesque draperies painted by nature. Alonzo attended Melissa to her father's, and the next day returned home. Melissa's spirits were this evening more than usually exhilirated. The difficulties were now surmounted which had obstructed her road to happiness. Previous to the dismissal of Bowman she had trembled in fearful anxiety for the consequences which might succeed that event. Her fame, her reputation, she believed in some degree involved in the result: she doubted whether Bowman would submit to the decision with calmness: it might produce an altercation, perhaps a serious one, between him and Haventon, whose personal safety might thereby be endangered: the story would then go forth to the world with invidious exaggerations, whereby her character would be injured, her innocence calumniated, and her peace of mind perhaps destroyed for ever. But by the discreet and prudent conduct of her father the affair had been honourably accommodated, and without difficulty. Her anticipations were now consoling and pleasing; the bright beams of felicity gilded the horizon of her future prospects. She retired to rest indulging in the most cheering reflections: they extended their influence to visions of the night; in her dream she was standing again with Alonzo on the hill which overlooked the place of their chosen habitation; she thought they had recently been married; their seat rose in elegant convenience near the verge of the little lake, surrounded by gardens, fruit-trees and flowering shrubs, all in rich bloom: shady avenues sloped to the water: the landscape around was beyond description splendid: sheep and cattle strayed over the pastures; small rivulets rushed from the hills and wound along the fields; light gales sported among the foliage of the adjacent forest; interspersed over a meadow, beautiful in green verdure, blossomed apple-trees displayed their red and white teints, from whence the mild breezes wafted odours: birds of gaudy plumage fluttered around them, or symphoniously carolled the lay of nature amidst the branches of adjacent trees: never had the sky clothed itself in so bright a hue, the sun so clearly shone, or creation arrayed herself in so rich, so enchanting a dress. They descended to the house; Edgar met them at the door; there had their parents and friends assembled; a sumptuous feast was preparing; all were joyful, all gay, and mirth and hilarity floated in cheerful circles. Melissa awoke with the most pleasing sensations: a gentle shower was falling; she heard it patter upon the roof: again she closed her eyes, and was lulled to sleep by the still rains of summer. Again she dreamed: she thought she was wandering in a lonely and solitary place, amidst scattered groves faded by the frosts of autumn; yellow, withering leaves were falling around her; the breeze sighed in mournful cadence with the solemn murmur of a passing rill; the wailings of expiring insects were mingled with the stock-dove's plaintive note; slow and awful came the sound of a distant bell, tolling the knell of death; a thick vapour enveloped the sun; dark thunder-clouds rolled along the heavens; boisterous winds began to rise, while deep in the forest was heard the commencement of the rumbling storm. She came to the shores of the Sound, near a spacious river, foaming, roaring and rushing to the sea, which raging in wild commotion was tost into mountainous billows; soon they burst upon the shore; instantly she was surrounded by the flood; a rocky eminence was near; she ascended it with difficulty; looking down, she beheld a deep, horrid chasm yawning beneath her feet; suddenly she heard cries of distress; casting her eyes in the direction whence they came, she saw a little skiff struggling with the violence of the stream; the person who vainly endeavoured to guide it she immediately perceived to be Alonzo; a large mass of timber broken by the gale was floating rapidly down the river towards him; he raised his hands and eyes to Heaven as it approached the skiff; quickly it reached him, overwhelmed and swept him with amazing velocity to the ocean. Melissa shrieked, and in stretching out her arms towards the place where he had disappeared, sunk into the abyss below: at that moment a voice sounded these words in her ears—it seemed the dying voice of Alonzo— The memory of joys that are past is the last joy to the unfortunate. She awoke in extreme agitation, thankful to Heaven that her dream was not a reality. Daylight had appeared and she arose: she placed not much faith in dreams, yet she knew the Scriptures testified that they were formerly the precursors of important events; those two she had now experienced were of a direct contrary tendency; which, if either, was she to consider predictive? The first was in harmony with her feelings, and had arisen probably from her daily contemplations, and the scenes through which she had recently passed: the last was extraordinary; she feared it was ominous; it made so deep an impression upon her mind that it was several days before she recovered her usual tranquility and accustomed cheerfulness. A few days after these events Haventon's father went to one of the commercial seaports on business with some merchants with whom he was connected in trade; when he returned the following evening his aspect and his conversation were marked with an assumed and unmeaning gaiety: at supper he ate nothing, discoursed much, but in an unconnected and hurried manner, interrupted by long pauses, in which he appeared to be buried in contemplation: after supper he asked his son if it were not possible that his marriage could be immediately consummated. Alonzo, startled at so unexpected a question, replied that such a proposal would be considered extraordinary, perhaps improper; besides, when Melissa fixed the time, she mentioned that she had an uncle who lived near Charleston in South-Carolina, whose daughter was to pass the summer at Bloomfield Vale, and was expected to arrive before the appointed marriage day. It would, he said, be a delicate point for him to solicit her to anticipate the nuptials, so soon to be celebrated, unless he could give some powerful reasons for the request, and at present he was not apprized that any such existed. His father after a few moments hesitation answered, “I have reasons, which when told—” here he stopped, suddenly arose, hastily walked the room in much apparent agony of mind, and then retired to his chamber. Haventon and his mother were much amazed at so strange a proceeding: they could form no conjecture of its cause or its consequence. Alonzo passed a sleepless night. His father's slumbers were interrupted; he would frequently start up in the bed, then sink into restless sleep with incoherent mutterings and plaintive moans. In the morning when he appeared at breakfast his countenance wore the marks of dejection and anguish; he scarcely uttered a word, and after the table was removed ordered all to withdraw except his wife and son, when with emotions that spoke the painful feelings of his bosom, he thus addressed them: “For more than forty years I have toiled early and late to acquire independence and case for myself and family: to accomplish this I became connected with some English, VOL. II. B importing merchants and went largely into the British trade: success crowned our endeavours: on balancing our accounts two years ago we found our expectations fully answered, and that we were sufficiently wealthy to close business, which some proposed to do; it was however agreed to make one effort more, as certain favourable circumstances appeared to offer; in this we adventured very largely on a fair calculation of liberal and extensive profits; before returns could be made the war came on; embarrassments ensued, and by indubitable intelligence lately received we find that our property in England has been sequestrated; five of our ships laden with British goods, lying in English harbours and just ready to sail for America, have been seized as lawful prizes: added to this, three vessels from the Indies freighted with island produce, have been taken on their homeward bound passage, and one lost returning from Holland. This wreck of fortune I might have survived, had I to sustain only my equal dividend of the loss; but of the merchants with whom I have been concerned, not one remains to share the fate of the event; all have absconded or secreted themselves. To attempt to compound with my creditors would be of little avail; my whole fortune will not pay one fourth of the debts, so that compound or not the consequence to me is inevitable ruin. “To abscond would not secure me, as most of my remaining property is vested in real estate; and even if it would, I could never submit to it; I could not consent to banish myself from my country, to flee like a felon, to skulk from society with the base view of defrauding my creditors: no, I have lived honestly and honestly will I die. By fair application and long industry my wealth has been obtained, and it shall never justly be said that the reputation of my latter days was stained with acts of baseness and meanness. I have notified and procured a meeting of the creditors, and have laid the matter before them: some appeared favourable to me; others insisted that we were all united in fraudulent designs and for swindling purposes: this false charge I repelled with becoming spirit, and was in consequence threatened with immediate prosecution. Whatever may be the event, I had some hopes that your happiness, Alonzo, might yet be secured: hence I proposed your union with Melissa before our misfortunes should be promulgated. Your parents are old; a little will serve the residue of their days. With your acquirements you may make your way in life. I shall have no property to give you, but I would wish you to secure that which you prize far above, and without which both honours and emoluments are unimportant and worthless.”—At this moment a loud rap at the door interrupted the discourse, and three men were ushered in, who proved to be the sheriff and his attendants, sent by the more inexorable creditors of Alonzo's father and company, to level on the property of the former, which orders they faithfully executed by seizing the lands, tenements and furniture, and finally arresting the old gentleman, but who was instantly released by his friendly neighbours, who gave bail for his appearance; but the property was soon after sold at public auction for less than half its real value, and Haventon's father and mother were compelled to abandon the premises, leave the town and take shelter in a little hut belonging to a neighbouring farmer, illy and temporarily furnished by the gratuitous liberality of a few friends. We will not stop the reader to moralize on this disastrous event. The affliction of the family, thus hurled in a moment from the lofty summit of affluence to the low and barren vale of poverty, can better be apprehended than described. Philosophy came to the aid of the parents, but who can realize the feelings of the son, so suddenly cut short in his prospects, not only of independence, but even of future support! What would be the event of his suit to Melissa, and stipulated marriage? Was it not probable that her father would now cancel the contract? Could she consent to become his wife in his present penurious situation? And indeed, could he himself wish to make her so to render her miserable? In this agitated frame of mind Alonzo received a letter from Vincent requesting him to come immediately to his house, whither he repaired the following day: he had heard of the calamities which had overwhelmed the Haventon family, and deeply sympathized in their distress. Mrs. Vincent and Melissa were on terms of friendly acquaintance. VOL. II. B 2 When Alonzo arrived at the house of his friend he was received with the same disinterested ardour he ever had been in the days of his most unbounded prosperity. “The occasion of my sending for you,” said Vincent, “is to propose the adoption of certain measures which I doubt not may be highly beneficial as it respects your future peace and happiness. Your family misfortunes have reached the ears of Col. Bloomfield; I know the old gentleman too well to believe he will consent to receive you as his son-in-law under your present embarrassments. Money is the god to which he implicitly bows. The case is difficult but not insurmountable: you must first see Melissa; she is now in the next room; I will conduct you in; converse with her; after which I will lay my plan before you.” Alonzo entered the room; Melissa was sitting by a window which looked into a pleasant garden, and over verdant meadows whose tall grass waved to the passing breeze; farther on low valleys spread their umbrageous thickets, where the dusky shadows of night had begun to assemble: on high hills beyond, the tops of lofty forests, majestically moved by the billowy gales, caught the sun's last ray; fleecy summer clouds hovered around the verge of the western horizon, spangled with silvery teints, or fringed with the gold of evening; a mournfully murmuring rivulet purled at a little distance from the garden on the borders of a small grove, from whence the American wild-dove wafted her sympathetic moanings to Miss Bloomfield's ear. She sat leaning on a small table by the window which was thrown up; her attention was fixed; she did not perceive Vincent and Haventon as they entered: they advanced towards her; she turned, started and arose: with a melancholy smile and tremulous voice, “I supposed,” she said, “that it was Mrs. Vincent who was approoaching, as she has just left the room.” Her countenance appeared dejected, which on her seeing Alonzo lighted up into a languid sprightliness. It was evident she had been weeping. Vincent retired and they seated themselves by the window. “I have broken in upon your solitude perhaps too unseasonably,” said Alonzo; “it is however the fault of Vincent; he invited me to walk into the room, but did not inform me that you was alone.” “Your presence was sudden and unexpected, but not unseasonable,” replied Melissa; “I hope you do not consider any formality necessary in your visits, Alonzo.” Alonzo. I once did not suppose so; now I know not what to think—I know not how to act. You have learnt the misfortunes of my family, Melissa? Melissa. Yes; I have heard the circumstances attending that event; an event in which no one could be more deeply interested, except the immediate sufferers, than myself. Al. Your father is also acquainted with my present situation? Mel. He is. Al. How did he receive the intelligence? Mel. With deep regret. Al. And forbade you to admit my addresses any longer? Mel. No; not absolutely. Al. If even in an unqualified and indirect manner it is proper I should know it. Mel. It certainly is. Soon after we received the intelligence of your calamities my father came into the room where I was sitting, “Melissa,” said he, “your conduct has ever been that of a dutiful child; mine of an indulgent parent. My first and ultimate wish is to see my children when settled in life happy and honourably respected: for this purpose I have bestowed on them a proper education, and design suitably to apportion my property between them; on their part it is expected they will act prudently and discreetly, especially in those things which concern their future peace and welfare; the principal requisite to ensure these is a proper connexion in marriage.” Here he paused a considerable time, and then continued: “I know, my child, that your situation is a very delicate one: your marriage day is appointed; it was fixed under the fairest prospects; by the failure of Haventon's house those prospects have become deeply darkened, if not totally obliterated. To commit your fortune through life to a person unable to support you, would be hazardous in the extreme: the marriage can at least be suspended; perhaps something more favourable may appear; at any rate, I have too much confidence in your discretion to suppose that you will by any rash act bring either censure or reproach upon yourself, or odium and dishonour upon your connexions.” Thus spake my father and immediately withdrew. “In the present dilemma,” said Alonzo, “what is proper to be done?” “It is difficult to determine,” replied Melissa; “should my father expressly forbid our union, he will as positively endeavour to enforce his commands; nor could I consider it my duty to resist them. Although a tender parent, he is violent in his prejudices and resolute in his purposes. I would advise you to visit me tomorrow with your usual freedom. Whatever may be the result, I shall deal sincerely with you. The Vincents are now my only confidents; from them you will be enabled to obtain information should I be prevented seeing you. I am frequently here; they told me they expected you, but at what day was not known. Mrs. Vincent is my friend; her husband you know: in them we can place the most implicit confidence. My reliance on Providence I trust will never be shaken, but my future prospects at present are dark and discouraging.” “Let us not despair,” answered Alonzo, “perhaps those gloomy clouds which now hover around us will yet be dissipated by the bright beams of joy. Innocence and virtue are the care of Heaven; there lies my hope. Tomorrow, as you propose, I will call at your house.” Melissa prepared to return home; Haventon attended her to her father's door. A whipperwill tuned its nightly song at a little distance; but the sound, late so cheerful and sprightly, now passed heavily over their hearts. When Alonzo returned Vincent unfolded the plan he had projected. “No sooner,” said he, “was I informed of your misfortunes than I was convinced that Col. Bloomfield would endeavour to dissolve your intended union with his daughter. I have known him many years, and however he may prize his children or value their happiness, he will not hesitate to sacrifice his other feelings to the acquirement of riches. It appears that you have but one resource left; you and Melissa are now united by the most solemn ties, by every rite except those which are merely ceremonial: these I would advise you to enter into and trust to the consequences. Mrs. Vincent has proposed the scheme to Melissa, but implicitly accustomed to parental obedience, she shudders at the idea of a clandestine marriage; yet when her father shall proceed to rigorous measures, she will, I think, consent to the alternative; and this course once adopted, he must submit; or if not, you secure your own happiness, and what you esteem more, that of Melissa.” “But should she consent to this measure, which I much doubt,” replied Alonzo, “where are my means of independence, or even of subsistence?” “The world is before you,” answered Vincent, “you have friends who will never desert you, you have acquirements which can never fail you. In a country like this you can hardly fail of obtaining a competency, which with the other requisites will ensure you contentment and felicity.” Alonzo informed Vincent what had been arranged between Melissa and himself respecting his visiting her on the morrow, “after which,” said he, “we will discourse farther upon the subject.” The next day he repaired to the house of Col. Bloomfield. As he approached he saw Melissa sitting in a shady recess at one end of the garden, near which the road passed: she was leaning with her head upon her hand in a pensive posture; a deep dejection was depicted upon her features, which enlivened into a transient glow soon as she saw Alonzo. She arose, met him, and invited him into the house. He was received with cool reserve by her father, who saluted him with only a distant and retiring bow as he passed with Melissa to the sitting-room. Soon as they were seated her aunt entered, and bounced into a chair, where she sat, alternately humming a tune, and impudently staring at Alonzo without speaking a word, except snappishly to contradict VOL. II. C Melissa in any thing she advanced, which the latter passed off with only a faint smile. This interruption was not of long continuance; Col. Bloomfield soon came in and requested the two ladies to withdraw, which was instantly done. He then addressed Alonzo as follows: “When I gave consent for you to marry my daughter it was on the conviction that your future resources would be adequate to support her honourably and independently. Circumstances have since occurred which render this point extremely doubtful. Parental duty and affection demand that I should know your means and prospects before I sanction a proceeding which may reduce my child to penury and to want.” He paused for a reply, but Alonzo was silent. He continued— “You must readily perceive that to burden yourself with the expense of a family, to transfer a woman from affluence to poverty, without even an object in view whereby to provide for either, would be the height of folly and extravagance.” Again he paused, but Alonzo was still silent. He proceeded— “Could you, Mr. Haventon, endure life, when you should see the wife of your bosom, probably your infant children, pining in misery for want of bread? And what else have you to expect if you marry in your present situation? I know you possess talents, and have had an education; but what are they without means? You have friends who respect you; but which of them will advance you four or five thousand pounds as a gratuity? My daughter must be supported according to her character and station in life: are you enabled to do this? If not, you cannot reasonably suppose that I shall accede to your marrying her. You may say that your acquirements, your prudence and your industry will procure you a competent support; in single life perhaps they might; but to depend on these for the future exigencies of a family, is hazarding peace, honour and reputation at a single game of chance. If therefore you have no resources, or expectations but such as these, your own judgment, your own discretion will teach you the necessity of immediately relinquishing all pretensions to the hand of my daughter.” He then retired. Why was Alonzo speechless through the whole of this discourse? What reply could he have made? What were the prospects before him but penury, want, misery and woe? Where indeed were the means by which Miss Bloomfield was to be supported in style, or even shielded from poverty, if connected with his fortunes? The idea was not new, but it came upon him with redoubled anguish. He arose and looked around for Melissa, but she was not to be seen; he left the house and walked slowly towards Vincent's; at a little distance he met her; she had been strolling in an adjoining avenue: he informed her of all that had passed; it was no more than they both expected, yet it was a shock their fortitude could scarcely sustain. Disappointment, though anticipated, seldom finds her victims prepared to receive her. Melissa told Alonzo that her father's determinations were unchangeable; that his sister held considerable power over him and dictated the concerns of the family, and that from her there was nothing to hope in their favour. Her mother, she said, was her friend, but could not counteract the will of her father. Edgar would be at home in a few days; how he would act on this occasion she was unable to say; but were he even in their interest, he would have but feeble influence with her father and aunt. “What is to be the end of these troubles,” she continued, “it is impossible to foresee; let us trust in the mercy of Heaven, and submit to its dispensations.” In their happier days they had, when absent, corresponded by letters: this method it was now thought best to relinquish. It was agreed that Alonzo should come frequently to Vincent's, where Melissa would meet him as opportunity presented. Having concluded on this, she returned home and he to the house of his friend. Vincent, after Haventon had related the manner of his reception by Col. Bloomfield, urged the plan he had projected of a private marriage. Alonzo replied that even should Melissa agree to it, of which he had little hopes, it must be a measure of the last resort, and adopted only when all others became ineffectual. VOL. II. C 2 The next morning Alonzo returned to the hut where his aged parents now dwelt. His bosom throbbed with keen anguish: his own fate unconnected with that of Melissa, he considered of little consequence; but their united situation tortured his soul. What was to become of her; what of himself; what of his parents? “Alas!” said he, “I now perceive the value of wealth in this life.” Haventon's father was absent when he arrived, but returned soon after: a beam of joy gleamed upon his withered countenance as he entered the house. “Were it not, Alonzo, for your unhappy situation,” said he, “we should once more be restored to peace and comfort. A few persons who were indebted to me, finding that I was to be sacrificed by my unfeeling creditors, reserved those debts in their hands, and have now paid me the sum, amounting to something more than five hundred pounds; with part of this I have bought a small but well cultivated farm with convenient buildings. I have enough left to purchase what stock and other materials I need, and to spare some for your present exigencies, my son.” Alonzo thanked his father for his kindness, but told him that from his former liberality he had yet sufficient for his wants, and that he should soon find business which would amply support him. “But your affair with Miss Bloomfield,” asked his father, “how is that likely to terminate?” “Favourably, I hope, Sir,” he answered: he was unwilling to interrupt the tranquility of his parents by disclosing his own wretchedness. A week passed away. Alonzo saw his parents removed to their little farm, which was to be managed by his father and a hired man. He saw them comfortably settled; he saw them serenely blest in the calm pleasures of returning peace, and a ray of joy illumined his troubled bosom. “Again the youth his wonted life regain'd; A transient sparkle in his eye obtain'd; A bright, impassion'd, cheering glow, express'd The pleas'd sensations of his feeling breast. But soon dark glooms the feeble smiles o'erspread; Like morn's gay hues the fading splendours fled; Returning anguish froze his feeling soul, Deep sighs burst forth and tears began to roll.” He thought on Melissa, from whom he had heard nothing since he last saw her; he contemplated the difficulties that surrounded him; he reflected upon the barriers which were opposed to his happiness, and to the felicity of her whose peace he valued much higher than his own, and he set out for the house of Vincent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. For here the voice of mirth is heard no more; A silent sadness o'er the scene prevails; The distant main alone is heard to roar, And hollow chimneys hum with sullen gales. Humphreys. Alonzo arrived at the residence of his friend near the close of day. Vincent and his wife were at tea with several young ladies who had passed the afternoon with Mrs. Vincent. Haventon cast an active glance around the company in hopes to find Melissa, but she was not there. On invitation, he accepted a seat in the circle. After tea, Vincent led him into an adjoining room: “You have come in good time,” said he; “something must speedily be done or you lose Miss Bloomfield for ever: the day after you left here her father received a letter from Bowman, in which, after alluding to the circumstances of your father's insolvency, he hinted that the consequence might probably be a failure of the proposed marriage, which might essentially injure the reputation of a lady so delicately situated, and of so respectable a character and family; to prevent which, and to place her beyond the reach of calumny, he offered to marry her at any appointed day, provided he had her free consent. As Bowman by the recent death of his father has been put in possession of a splendid fortune, the proposition allured the Colonel, who wrote him a complaisant answer, with an invitation to his house. He then endeavoured to extort a promise from Melissa that she would break off all connexion with you, and admit the addresses of Bowman: to this she could not consent; she urged that with the approbation of her parents she was engaged to you by the most solemn ties; that to her father's will she had hitherto yielded implicit obedience, but that hastily to break such sacred obligations, formed, sanctioned and approved by him, was what her conscience would not permit her to do. Were he to command her to live single, life might be endured, but to give her hand to any except to you, would be to perjure those principles of truth and justice which he himself had ever taught her to hold most inviolable. Her father grew outrageous; charged her with disobedience, with a blind inconsiderate perverseness, by which she would bring ruin upon herself and indelible disgrace upon her family. She answered only with her tears. Her mother interposed and endeavoured to appease his anger, but he spurned her from him, and rushed out of the room, uttering a threat that force should succeed persuasion if his commands were not obeyed. To add to Melissa's distress, Bowman arrived yesterday; and I hope in some measure to alleviate it, Edgar, her brother, came this morning. Mrs. Vincent's visitors have departed, and she has despatched a message to inform Melissa of your arrival, and to request her to come her immediately. She will undoubtedly comply with the invitation if not prevented by something extraordinary. I should have written you had I not hourly expected your arrival.” Mrs. Vincent now came to the door of the room and beckoned to her husband, who went out, but instantly returned leading in Melissa, after which he retired. “Oh, Alonzo!” was all she could say, and burst into tears. Haventon led her to a seat, gently pressed her hand, and mingled his tears with hers, but was unable to speak. Recovering at length, he begged her to moderate her grief: “Where is your fortitude and your firmness,” said he, “Melissa, which I have so often seen triumphing over affliction?” Her extreme anguish prevented reply. Deeply affected and alarmed at the storm of distress which raged in her bosom, he endeavoured to console her, though consolation was a stranger to his own breast. “Let us not,” he continued, “increase our flood of afflictions by a tide of useless sorrow: perhaps more prosperous days are yet in reserve for us; happiness may still be ours.” “Never, never!” she exclaimed, “Oh, what will become of me?” “Heaven cannot desert you;” said Alonzo; “as well might it forsake its angels. This thorny and gloomy path may lead to fair fields of light and verdure. Tempests are succeeded by calms; war ends in peace; the splendours of the brightest morning arise on the wings of blackest midnight: troubles with not always last: life at most is short; death comes to the relief of the virtuous wretched, and transports them to “another and a better world,” where sighing and sorrows cease, and the tempestuous passions are known no more.” The rage of grief which had overwhelmed Melissa, began now to subside, as the waves of the ocean gradually cease their tumultuous agitation after the turbulent winds are laid asleep. Deep sobs and long drawn sighs succeeded to a suffocation of tears. The irritation of her feelings had caused a more than usual glow upon her cheek, which faded away as she became composed, until a livid paleness spread itself over her features. Alonzo feared that the delicacy of her constitution would fall a sacrifice to the sorrow which preyed upon her heart, if not speedily alleviated; but where, alas, were the means of alleviation! She informed him that her father had that evening ordered her to prepare to become the wife of Bowman; her disobedience, he said, was no longer to be borne; “No longer,” he exclaimed, “will I tamper with your perverseness; you are determined to be poor, wretched and contemptible; I will compel you to be rich, happy and respected. You suffer the jack-a-lantern, fancy, to lead you VOL. II. D into swamps and quagmires, when, did you but follow the fair light of reason, it would conduct you to honour and real felicity. Happiness and misery await your choice: marry Bowman, and you roll in your coach and flaunt in your silks; your furniture and your equipage are splendid, your associates of the first character, and your family rejoice in your prosperity: marry Haventon, and you sink into obscurity, are condemned to drudgery, poorly fed, worse clothed, and your relations and acquaintance shun and despise you. The comparison I have here drawn between Bowman and Haventon is a correct one, for even the wardrobe of the former is of more value than the whole fortune of the latter. I give you now two days for consideration and reflection; at the end of that time I shall expect your decision, and hope you will decide discreetly: but remember, that you become the wife of Bowman, or you are no longer acknowledged as my daughter.” “Thus,” said Melissa, “did my father pronounce his determination, which shook my frame, and chilled with horror every nerve of my heart, and immediately left me. My aunt added her taunts to his severities, and Bowman interfered with his ill-timed consolation. My mother and Edgar ardently strove to allay the fever of my soul, and mitigate my distress: but the stroke was almost too severe for my nature. Habituated only to the smiles of my father, how could I support his frowns! Accustomed to receive his blessings alone, how could I endure his sudden malediction!” Description would fail in painting the sensations of Alonzo's bosom at this recital of woe; but the endeavoured to mitigate her sorrows by the consoling hope of more cheering prospects and happier hours. Vincent and his lady came into the room: they strenuously urged the propriety and the necessity of an immediate and inseparable union between the distressed pair. “It will at least disperse the clouds of affliction which now surround you,” said Mrs. Vincent, “and in future you can scarcely anticipate superior calamity.” “The measure would be hazardous,” remarked Melissa. “My circumstances,” said Alonzo— “Not on that account,” interrupted she, “but my father's displeasure”— “Will be the same whether you marry Alonzo or refuse to marry Bowman,” replied Vincent. Her resolution appeared to be shaken. “Come here, Melissa, tomorrow evening,” said Mrs. Vincent; “mean time you will consider the matter and then determine.” To this she assented, and prepared to return home. Haventon walked with her to the gate which opened into the yard surrounding her father's house: it was dangerous for him to go farther; should he be discovered with Melissa, even by a domestic of the family, it must increase the persecutions against her. They parted: he stood at the gate, gazing anxiously after her as she walked up the long winding avenue, bordered with the odour-flowering lilac and lofty elm, her white robes now invisible, now “dimly seen,” as she turned the angles of the walk, until they were totally obscured, mingling with the gloom and darkness of the night. “Thus,” thought he, “fades the angel of peace from the visionary eyes of the war-worn soldier, when it ascends in the dusky clouds of early morning, while he slumbers on the field of recent battle.” With mournful forebodings he returned to the house of Vincent. He arose after a sleepless night and walked into an adjoining field. He stood leaning in deep contemplation against a tree, when he heard quick footsteps behind him; he turned and saw Edgar approaching; in a moment they were in each other's arms and mingled tears; they returned to Vincent's and conversed largely on present affairs. “I have discoursed with my father on the subject,” said Edgar; “I have urged him with every possible argument to relinquish his determination; I fear however he is inflexible. To assuage the tempest of distress which rent Melissa's bosom, was my next object, and in this I have not been unsuccessful; you will see her this evening and will find her more calm and resigned. You, Alonzo, must exert your fortitude: the ways of Heaven VOL. II. D 2 are inscrutable, but they are right; we must acquiesce in its dealings; we cannot alter its decrees: resignation to its will, whether merciful or afflictive, is one of those eminent virtues which adorn the good man's character, and which ever find a brilliant reward in the regions of unsullied splendour, far beyond trouble and the tomb.” Edgar told Alonzo that circumstances compelled him that day to depart for the army. “I would advise you,” he continued, “to remain here until your affair comes to some final issue; it must, I think, ere long be determined; possibly my father may relent; perhaps you and my sister may yet be happy.” Haventon feelingly expressed his gratitude to Bloomfield. He found in him that disinterested friendship which his early youth had experienced. Edgar the same day departed for the army. In the afternoon Alonzo received a note from Melissa's father, requesting his immediate attendance. Surprised at the incident, he repaired there instantly. The servant introduced him into a room where Col. Bloomfield and his sister were sitting: the former motioned him to a seat, and then thus addressed him: “Understanding you were in the neighbourhood, I have sent for you to make a proposition, with which, after what has taken place, I think you cannot hesitate to comply. The occurrence of previous circumstances may lead you to suppose that my daughter is under obligations to you, which may render it improper for her to form marriage connexions with any other. Whatever embarrassments your addresses to her may have produced, it is in your power to remove them, and if you are a man of honour you will not hesitate to do so. You cannot wish to involve Melissa in your present penurious condition, unless you are willing to make her wretched. It therefore only remains for you to give me a writing voluntarily resigning all pretensions to the hand of my daughter; and if you desire she may be happy, honourable and respected in life, this, I say, you will readily do.” He paused. “I cannot perceive,” replied Haventon, “any particular advantage that can arise from such a measure; it will neither increase nor diminish the power you possess to command obedience to your will, if you are determined to command it, either from your daughter— or your servant.” “There, brother,” bawled Miss Martha, half squeaking through her nose which was well charged with rappee, “there! did'nt I tell you so? I knew the fellow would come to no terms, no more than will your refractory daughter. This love fairly bewitches such foolish, crack-brained youngsters. But say, Mr.—what's your name,” addressing herself to Haventon, “will love heat the oven? Will love boil the pot? Will love clothe the back? Will love”— “You will not,” interrupted Col. Bloomfield, speaking to Alonzo, “it seems, accede to my proposition. I have then one demand to make, which of right you cannot resist; promise me that you will never see my daughter again unless by my permission.” “At the present moment I am prepared to promise you nothing, Sir,” replied Alonzo, with some warmth. “There, again,” exclaimed the old maid, “just so Melissa told you this morning when you requested her to see him no more. The fellow has certainly crazed her. If I had him to deal with! Things wasn't so when I was a girl; I kept the rogues at a distance, I'll warrant you. I always told you, brother, what would come of your indulgence to your daughter; and I should not wonder were you soon to find that the girl had eloped, and your desk robbed into the bargain.” Alonzo hastily arose; “I suppose,” said he, “my presence may be dispensed with.” “Well, young man,” said Col. Bloomfield, “since you will not comply with any overtures I make; since you will not accede to any terms I propose, remember, Sir, I now warn you to break off all communication and correspondence with Melissa, and to relinquish every expectation concerning her. I shall never consent to marry my daughter to a beggar.” “Beggar!” involuntarily exclaimed Alonzo, and his eyes flashed resentment; but he recollected that it was the father of Melissa who had thus insulted him, and he suppressed his indignation. He rushed out of the house and returned to Vincent's. He had neither heard nor seen any thing of Melissa or Bowman. Night came on, and he ardently and anxiously expected Melissa; he anticipated the consolation her presence would bestow. Edgar had told him she was more composed; he doubted whether it were proper to excite anew her distress by relating his interview with her father, unless she was already apprized of it. The evening passed on, but she came not. Alonzo grew restless and uneasy; he looked out, then at his watch; Vincent and his lady assured him she would soon be there: he paced the room; still he became more impatient: he walked out on the way she was expected to come; sometimes he advanced hastily, at others he moved slowly; then stood motionless, listening in breathless silence, momentarily expecting to discover her white form approaching through the gloom, or to hear the sound of her footsteps advancing amidst the darkness. Shapeless objects, either real or imaginary, frequently crossed his sight, but like all unreal phantoms of night, they suddenly passed away and were seen no more. At length he perceived a dusky white form advancing in the distant, dim obscurity: it drew near; his heart beat quick; his fond hopes told him it was Melissa; the object came up and hastily passed him with a “Good night, Sir.”—It was a stranger in a white surtout. Alonzo hesitated whether to advance or to return. It was possible, though not probable, that Mclissa might have come some other way. He hastened back to Vincent's; she had not arrived. “Something extraordinary,” said Mrs. Vincent, “has prevented her coming; perhaps she is ill.” Alonzo shuddered at the suggestion: he again looked at his watch; it was half past eleven o'clock: he instantly sallied out and took the road to her father's. The night was exceedingly dark and illuminated only by the feeble glimmer of half clouded twinkling stars. When he came within sight of the house, and as he drew nearer, no lights were visible, all was still and silent. He entered the yard, walked up the avenue and approached the door: the familiar watch-dog which lay near the threshold fawned upon him, joyfully whining and wagging his tail: “Thou still knowest me, Curlow,” said Alonzo, “thou hast known me in better days; I am now poor and wretched, but thy friendship is still the same; how much more benevolent art thou than man!” A death-like stillness prevailed all around, interrupted only by the discordance of the nightly insect and the hooting of the solemn owl from a neighbouring forest. The dwelling was shrouded in darkness: in Melissa's room no gleam of light appeared. “They are all buried in sleep,” said he, deeply sighing, “and I have only to return in disappointment.” He then walked towards the street; casting a glance back, the blaze of a candle caught his eye; it passed rapidly along the lower rooms, now gleaming, now intercepted, as the walls or the windows intervened, and suddenly disappeared; he gazed earnestly a few moments, and hastily returned: no noise was to be heard, no new object was discernable: he clambered over the garden wall and went around to the back side of the house; there all was dark and silent as in front: immediately a faint light appeared through one of the upper casements, it grew brighter, a candle entered the chamber, the sash was flung up and Melissa seated herself at the window. The weather was sultry; she held a fan in her hand; her countenance though stamped with deep dejection was marked with serenity, but pale as the drooping lily of the valley. Haventon placed himself directly under the window and in a low voice called her by name. She started wildly, looked out and faintly cried “Who's there?” He answered “Alonzo.” “Good heavens!” she exclaimed, “Is it you? I was disappointed in meeting you at Vincent's this evening; my father will not suffer me to go out without attendants. I am now constantly watched and strictly guarded.” “Guarded!” he replied; “At the risk of my life I will rescue you from the tyranny with which you are oppressed.” VOL. II. E “Be calm, Alonzo,” said she; “I think it will not long last: Bowman will soon depart, after which there will undoubtedly be some alteration. Desire Mrs. Vincent to come here tomorrow; I believe they will trust me to see her; I can from time to time inform you of passing events, so that you may know what changes take place. I am placed under the care of my aunt, who suffers me not to step out of her sight. We pass the night in an adjoining apartment, from whence, after she had fallen asleep, I stole out and went down with a design to walk in the garden, but found the doors all locked and the keys taken out: I returned and raised this window for fresh air. Hark!” she continued, “my aunt calls me; she has waked and misses me; I must fly to her chamber. You shall hear more from me tomorrow by Mrs. Vincent, Alonzo.” She then let down the window and retired. Haventon withdrew slowly from the place, and repassed the way he came. As he sprang back over the garden wall, he found a man standing at its foot very near him: after a moment's scrutiny he perceived it to be Bowman. “What, my chevalier,” said he to Alonzo, “such an adept in the amorous science already? Hast thou then eluded the watchful eyes of Argus and the vigilance of the dragon?” “Unfeeling and impertinent intruder!” retorted Haventon, seizing hold of him, “Is it not enough that an innocent daughter endure a merciless parent's persecuting hand, but must thou add to her misery by thy disgusting interference!” “Quit thy hold, Tarquin,” said Bowman; “art thou determined after storming the fortress to murder the garrison?” “Go!” replied Alonzo, quitting him; “Go, Sir! you are unworthy of my anger. Pursue thy grovelling schemes; strive to force to your arms a lady who abhors you, and were it on no other account must ever continue to despise and hate you.” “Haventon,” answered Bowman, “I perceive thou knowest me not. You and I were rivals in one pursuit—the hand of Miss Bloomfield. Whether from freak or fancy, the preference was given to you, and I retired in silence. From a coincidence of consequences her father has now been induced to give that preference to me. My belief was that Melissa would comply with her father's will, especially after her prospects of connecting with you were cut off by the events which have ruined your fortune. You, Haventon, have yet, I find, to learn the character of women; it has been my particular study. Miss Bloomfield, now ardently impassioned by first impressions, irritated by recent disappointment, her passions delicate and vivid, her affections animated and unmixed, it would be strange if she could suddenly relinquish primitive attachments founded on such premises without a struggle; but remove her from your presence for one short year, with only distant and uncertain prospects of seeing you again; admit me as the substitute in your absence, and she accepts my hand as freely as she would now receive yours. I had no design, it was never my wish, to marry her without her voluntary consent; that I believe will yet be obtained. Under existing circumstances it is impossible but that you must be separated for some considerable time; then, when cool deliberation succeeds to the wild vagaries, the electric fires of frolic fancy, she will discover the dangerous precipice, the deadly abyss to which her present conduct and inclinations lead; she will see that the blandishments without the possessions of life must fade and die; will discriminate between the shreds and the trappings of taste, and prefer indifference and splendour to love and a cottage. At present I relinquish all farther pursuit: tomorrow I return to New-London. When Melissa, from calm deliberation and the advice of friends, shall cheerfully agree to yield me her hand, I will return and receive it. I came from my lodgings this evening to declare these intentions to her father, but it being later than I was aware of, the family had retired to rest; I was about to return, when I saw a light from the chamber window, which soon withdrew; I stood a moment by the garden wall, when you approached and discovered me.” So saying, he bade Alonzo good night, and walked hastily away. “I find he understands not the character of Melissa,” thought Haventon, as he returned to Vincent's. VOL. II. E 2 The next day Alonzo told the Vincents of all that had passed, and it was agreed that Mrs. Vincent should visit at Col. Bloomfield's that afternoon: she went at an early hour. Alonzo's feelings were on the rack until she returned, which happened much sooner than was expected, when she gave the following information: “On arriving there,” said she, “I found Melissa's father and mother alone; the latter was in tears, which she endeavoured to conceal; the former soon withdrew. After some conversation I inquired for Melissa: Mrs. Bloomfield burst into tears, and told me that this morning Melissa's aunt had invited her to ride out: a carriage was provided, which, after a large trunk had been placed therein, drove off with only her and Miss Martha; that Col. Bloomfield had just informed her that he had sent their daughter to a distant part of the country, where she was to reside with a friend until Haventon should depart from the neighbourhood. The reason of this sudden resolution was his being apprized by Bowman, that notwithstanding his precaution, Melissa and Alonzo had an interview the last evening. Where she was sent to, the old lady could not tell, but she was convinced that Melissa was not aware of the design when she consented to go. Her aunt had resided heretofore, alternately, with the different relatives of the family, in various parts of the state, to one of which places they had probably gone.” Alonzo listened to Mrs. Vincent's relation with inexpressible agitation. He sat silent a few moments; then suddenly starting up, “I will find her if she be on the earth!” said he, and in spite of Vincent's attempts to prevent him, rushed out of the house, flew to the road, and was soon out of sight. Melissa had not indeed the most distant suspicion of the designs of her father and aunt. The latter said that she was going to take a morning ride, and invited her niece to accompany her, to which she consented: she did not even perceive the trunk which was fastened on behind the carriage. They were attended by a single servant, and drove to a neighbouring town where Melissa had frequently been with her father or mother to purchase articles of dress; there they alighted at a friend's house and lingered away the time until dinner, after which they prepared, as she supposed, to return, but found to her surprise when they entered the carriage, that her aunt ordered the driver to proceed a different way. She inquired if they were not going home. “Not yet,” said Miss Martha. Melissa grew uneasy; she expected to see Mrs. Vincent that afternoon; what disappointment must Alonzo experience if he heard nothing from her! She begged her aunt to return, as she expected the company of some ladies that afternoon. “You cannot see them, child,” answered the old maid. Melissa knew it was in vain to remonstrate; she supposed her aunt was bent on visiting some of her acquaintance, and remained silent. They arrived at another small village and alighted at an inn, where they tarried while the servant was ordered out on some business unknown to Melissa. When they again seated themselves in the carriage she perceived several large packages and bundles which had been deposited there since they left it. She inquired of aunt Martha what they contained; “Articles for family use, child,” she replied, and ordered the driver to proceed. They passed along winding and solitary paths, into a by-road which led through an unfrequented wood, that opened into a rocky part of the country, bordering on the Sound. Here they stopped at the only house in view; it was a miserable hut built of logs and covered with slabs. They alighted from the carriage, and Miss Martha handing the driver a large bunch of keys; “Remember to do as I have told you,” said she, and he drove rapidly away. It was with some difficulty they got into the hut, as a meagre cow with a long yoke on her neck, a board before her eyes and a cross-piece on her horns, stood with her head in the door; on one side of her were four or five half-starved squeaking pigs; on the other a flock of gaggling geese. As they entered the door, a woman who sat carding wool jumped up: “La me!” she cried, “here is Madam Bloomfield; welcome here again: how does Madam do?” dropping a low curtsey. She was dressed in a linseywoolsey short gown, a petticoat of the same; her hair hanging about her ears; bare-headed and barefoot. Three dirty, ragged children were playing about the floor, and the furniture was of a piece with the building. “Is my room in order?” inquired Martha. “It hasn't been touched since Madam was here,” answered the woman, and immediately stalked away to a little back apartment, which they entered after her: it was small, but neatly furnished and contained a single bed. This appendage had been concealed from Melissa's view, as it was opposite the side of the house at which she alighted. “Where is Jeffrey?” asked Martha. “My husband is in the garden,” replied the woman; “I will call him;” and out she scampered. Jeffrey soon appeared, and exhibited an exact counterpart to his wife. “What does Madam please to want?” inquired he, bowing three or four times. “I want you, Jeffrey,” she answered; and immediately gave some directions in a whisper to him and his wife. “Dear, doleful!” exclaimed the woman; “Madam a'n't a going to live in that terrible place.” Melissa could not understand her aunt's reply, but heard her give orders to “first hang on the teakettle.” This was done, when the man and his wife went out, and Martha prepared tea in her own room. In about an hour they returned, and gave the same bunch of keys to Martha which she had given to the servant who drove the carriage. Melissa was involved in inscrutable mystery respecting these extraordinary proceedings; she conjectured that they boded her no good, but could not prenetrate into her aunt's designs: she frequently looked out hoping to see the return of the carriage, but was disappointed. When tea was made ready she could neither eat nor drink: after her aunt had disposed of a dozen cups and an adequate proportion of buttered biscuit and dried beef, she directed Melissa to prepare to take a walk. The sun was low; they proceeded through fields in a foot path, over rough and uneven ways, directly towards the Sound; they walked about a mile, when they came in sight of a large, old-fashioned, castle-like building, surrounded with a moat, crossed by a drawbridge, and with high, thick, wooden walls; the build ing was almost totally concealed on all sides from view, by irregular rows of large locust and elm trees, dry Prim[1] [1] The Ligustrum vulgare of Linnæus. There were formerly a great number of prim hedges in New-England and other parts of America. It is a remarkable fact that they almost all died the year previous to the commencement of the American war. hedges and green shrubbery. The gate which opened into the yard was made of strong hard wood, thickly crossed on the outside with iron bars and filled with old nails and spikes. After passing the bridge, Melissa's aunt raised it, unlocked the gate, and they entered the inclosure, which was overgrown with rank grass and rushes; the avenue which led to the house was almost in the same condition. The mansion was of real Gothic architecture, built of rude stone with battlements; the doors were constructed in the same manner as the gate at which they entered; they opened one of them, which creaked heavily on its hinges, and went in, ascended a flight of stairs, wound through several dark and empty rooms, till they came to one which was handsomely furnished, with a fire burning on the hearth; two beds were in the room, with tables, chairs and other conveniences for housekeeping. “Here we are safe,” said Miss Martha, “as I have taken care to lock all the doors and gates after me. And here, Melissa, you are in the mansion of your ancestors. Your great grandfather who came over from England built this house in the earliest settlement of the country, and here he resided until his death. The reason why the moat, with so high and thick a wall, were formed around it, and the doors and gates so strongly fortified, was to secure it against the Indians, who frequently committed depredations on the early settlers. Your grandfather came into possession of this estate after his father's death; it fell to me by will, with the lands surrounding it. The house has sometimes been tenanted, at others not; it has now been vacant for a few years. The lands are rented yearly. Jeffrey, the person from whose house we last came, is a servant to one of my overseers and tenants. I had a small room built adjoining that hut, where I generally reside for a week when I come to receive my rents. I have thought frequently of fitting up this place for my future residence, but circumstances have hitherto hindered my carrying the scheme into effect, and now perhaps it will never take place. VOL. II. F “Your perverseness, Melissa, in refusing to comply with the wishes of your friends has induced us to adopt the plan of bringing you here, where you are to remain until Haventon leaves the neighbourhood of Bloomfield Vale, at least. Notwithstanding your father's injunctions and my vigilance, you had a clandestine interview with him last night; so we were told by Bowman this morning, before he set out for New-London, who discovered him at your window. It therefore became necessary to remove you immediately. You will want for nothing; Jeffrey is to supply us with every thing that is needful. You will not be long here; Haventon will soon be gone; you will think differently; return home, marry Bowman, and become a lady.” “My God!” exclaimed Melissa; “Is it possible my father can be so cruel? Is he so unfeeling as to banish me from his house, and confine me within the walls of a prison like a common malefactor!” She flung herself on the bed in a state little inferior to distraction. Her aunt told her it was all owing to her own obstinacy, and because she refused to be made happy, and went to preparing supper. Melissa heard none of these observations: she lay in stupifying agony, insensible to all that passed. When supper was ready her aunt attempted to arouse her; she started up, stared around her with a wild and agonizing countenance, but spake not a word. Martha became alarmed; applied stimulants to her temples and forehead, and persuaded her to take some cordials; but she remained seemingly insensible throughout the night; just at morning she fell into a slumber, interrupted by incoherent moanings, convulsive startings, long sighs, intermitting sobs, and frequent, sudden and restless turnings from side to side; at length she appeared to be in a calm and quiet sleep for nearly an hour. About sunrise she awoke; her aunt sat by her bed-side; she gazed languidly about the room, then bursting into tears, wept a long time; Martha endeavoured to console her, for she really began to tremble lest Melissa's distress should produce her immediate dissolution; towards night, however, she became more calm and resigned, but a slight fever succeeded, which kept her confined for several days, after which she slowly recovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. A thousand phantoms glide the midnight hall, And groans ascend along the mouldering wall; Dim shadows flutter through the dreary gloom, And ghostly voices sound from room to room; A light appears—some hollow voice is near— Chill terror starts—and every pulse is fear. Linn. Jeffrey came frequently to the mansion for directions, and provided such things as they needed. Miss Martha sometimes went home with him, leaving the keys of the house with her niece, but locking the gate and taking the key of that with her. She generally returned before sunset. When Melissa was so far recovered as to walk out, she found that the house was situated on an eminence, about one hundred perches from the Sound. The yard was large and extensive; within the inclosure was a spacious garden, now overrun with brambles and weeds; some medical and odoriferous herbs were scattered therein, and a few solitary flowers overtopped the tangling briers below, but there was plenty of fruit on the shrubbery and trees. The out-buildings were generally in a ruinous state. The cemetery was the most perfect, as it was built of freestone and marble, and had best withstood the ravages of time. The rooms in the house were mostly empty and decaying; the main building was firm and strong, as was also the extended wall which inclosed the whole. She found that although her aunt, when they first arrived, had led her through several upper rooms to the chamber she inhabited, yet there was from thence a direct passage to the hall. The prospect was not disagreeable: west, all was wilderness, from a brook which wound along at a little distance without the garden wall: north were the uneven grounds she had crossed when she came there, bounded by distant groves and hills: east, beautiful meadows and fields, arrayed in flowery green, sloped to the salt marshes or sandy banks of the Sound, or ended in the long white beaches which extended far into the sea; south was the Sound and Long-Island. Melissa passed much of her time in tracing the ruins of this antiquated place; in viewing VOL. II. F 2 the many different sails as they passed up and down the Sound, and in listening to the songs of the numerous and various species of birds which frequented the garden, the inclosure and the forest. She would have been contented here to bury her afflictions, and for ever to retire from the world, could Alonzo but have resided within these walls. “What will he think has become of me,” she would say, while the disconsolate tear of reflection glittered in her eye. Aunt Martha had frequently urged her to yield to her father's injunctions, regain her liberty and marry Bowman, and she every day became more solicitous and importunate. A subject so hateful to Melissa, sometimes provoked her tears, at others excited her resentment: she therefore, when the weather was fair, strolled about the garden, through the adjoining walks, and around the inclosure, wishing to be as little in her aunt's company as possible. One day Jeffrey came there early in the morning, and Miss Martha went home with him. The day passed away but she did not return. Melissa sat up until a late hour expecting her; she then went to the gate and found it was fast locked, returned, bolted and fastened the doors of the house, went to bed and slept as soundly as she had done since her residence in the old mansion. “I have at least,” she said, “escaped the disgusting curtain-lecture about marrying Bowman.” The next day her aunt returned. “I was quite concerned about you, child,” said she; “how did you sleep?” “Never better,” answered Melissa, “since I have been here.” “I had forgotten,” said Martha, “that my rents became due this week; I was detained until late by some of my tenants; Jeffrey was out, and I dare not return in the night alone. I must go back to-day; it will take me a week to settle my business; if I am obliged to stay out again, I will send one of Jeffrey's daughters to sleep with you.” “You need not give yourself that trouble,” replied Melissa; “I am under no apprehension of staying here alone; nothing can get in or out of these premises.” “Well thou hast wonderful courage, child,” said her aunt; “but I will be as often here as possible, and as soon as my business is settled I shall be absent no more.” She then bade Melissa good morning and departed. She did not return in two days. The second night of her absence Melissa was sitting in her chamber, reading, when she heard a noise, as of several people trampling in the yard below. She arose, cautiously raised the window and looked out. It was extremely dark; she could discern nothing. All was still, and she thought she must have been mistaken. Her aunt came the next day, and told her she was obliged to go into the country to collect some debts of those to whom she had rented lands. She should be gone a few days, and when she returned would come there. “The keys of the house,” said she, “I will leave with you. The gate I shall lock, and leave that key with Jeffrey, who will be here as often as is necessary to assist you, and see if you want any thing.” She then went off, leaving her niece not dissatisfied with the prospect of her absence. Melissa amused herself on evenings by reading in the few books her aunt had brought there, and in the day-time by walking around the yard and garden, or in traversing the rooms of this antique building. In some, were the remains of ancient furniture, others were entirely empty. Cobwebs and mouldering walls were the principal ornaments left. One evening, when about retiring to rest, she thought she heard the same trampling noises in the yard, as on a former occasion. She stepped softly to the window, suddenly raised it, and holding out the candle, she fancied she saw the glance of two or three dark forms pass swiftly along, but so indistinctly that it was impossible to determine whether they were real, or only shadows produced by objects intervening the light of the candle. She listened and gazed with anxious solicitude, but discovered nothing more; then shut the window, and in a short time went to bed. But for a length of time she could not sleep. She had been alarmed by appearances, either real or imaginary; probably the latter, but possibly the former, and if so, how distressing her situation! Secluded in a desolate building, insolated, far removed from society, beyond the reach of assistance, whatever dangers might arise, whatever evils should threaten. She might even be murdered there, without the perpetrators fearing punishment or discovery. But on calmer reflection, she felt confident that no human being could enter the premises. The canal, the wall, the drawbridge, the gate, the building, were all originally constructed to resist the ravages of war, the attacks of the natives. When therefore the drawbridge was drawn up, and the gate effectually secured, as they then were, they could not be surpassed even by the wild beasts of the forest. Nothing except the winged inhabitants of air could gain access to the inclosure, and they were harmless. Composed by these considerations, she finally fell asleep; but was aroused to instant wakefulness, at what time, or by what cause, she knew not. She listened, and thought she could distinguish a low hum of voices, but in what direction she could not ascertain. The noise soon ceased, but she slept no more. Perceiving the next day that nothing had been displaced about the house or grounds, she concluded that her senses must have deceived her; or if the noises were real, they might have proceeded from the sailors of some vessel passing the Sound. A few evenings after, as she was preparing for bed, she was startled by what seemed the quick shutting of a door. With breathless attention she listened for some time, but heard nothing more. She then took the candle, went down stairs, and searched the rooms; but discovering no circumstance which could explain the cause of the alarm, she supposed it must have been effected by rats, which frequented the old building. With these impressions she returned to her chamber, and retired to repose. Some time in the night she was awakened by a sharp sound, apparently near her. She started in trembling panic; but endeavoured to compose herself with the idea that something had fallen from the shelves. While reflecting upon the incident, she plainly distinguished footsteps and voices in the rooms below. She shuddered; a cold chilly sweat ran down her face. Directly after, she was convinced that she heard whispering in her room. She raised herself up in the bed, and cast inquisitive eyes towards her chamber door. All was darkness; no object was visible; no noise assailed her ear, and she again lay down. Her mind was too much agitated and alarmed to admit sleep. She had evidently heard sounds, footsteps and voices in the house, and whisperings which appeared to be in her room. The yard gate was locked, of which Jeffrey had the key: she was confident that no person could ascend or get over the wall of the inclosure; but if that were practicable, how was it possible that any human being could enter the house! she possessed the key of every door, and they were all fast locked. A thought darted into her mind—was it not a plan which her aunt had contrived in order to frighten her into a compliance with the wishes of her father? But how could the house be entered without keys? This might be done with false ones. But from whence did the whispering proceed, which appeared close to her bed-side? Possibly it might be conveyed through the key-hole of her chamber door. These thoughts tended in some degree to allay her fears; they were possibilities at least, however improbable. As she was thus musing, a hand, cold as the icy fingers of death, grasped her arm, which lay on the outside of the bed-clothes. She screamed convulsively, and sprang up in the bed. Nothing was to be seen, no noise distinguished. She had not time to reflect. She flew out of bed, ran to the fire and lighted a candle. Her heart beat rapidly. She cast timid glances around the room; cautiously searching every corner, and examining the door. All things were in the same state she had left them when she went to rest. Her door was locked in the same manner. No visible being was in the room except herself. She sat down contemplating on these strange events. Was it not probable that she was right in her first conjectures respecting their being the works of her aunt, and effected VOL. II. G by her agents and their instrumentality? All was possible except the cold hand which had grasped her arm. Might not this be the delusion of a terrified and heated imagination? Or if by false keys the rooms had been entered below, might they not also be used to enter her chamber? But could the door of her room be unlocked, a person come in, approach her bed, depart, and relock the door, while she was awake, in so noiseless and silent a manner? All inclination for sleep had deserted her; she therefore determined not again to attempt it that night. She took up a book, but her spirits had been too much agitated by the past scenes to permit her to read. She looked out of the window: the moon was up, and cast a pale, imperfect lustre over the landscape. She reflected upon the sounds she had heard in the lower rooms; perhaps the doors were open; the thought was alarming. She unclosed her chamber door, and with the candle in her hand cautiously descended the stairs, casting an inquisitive eye in every direction, and stopping frequently to listen. She advanced to the door; it was locked; examined the others, they were in the same situation. She turned to go up stairs, when a loud whisper echoed through the hall, expressing “away! away!” She flew swiftly to her chamber, relocked the door, and flung herself almost breathless into a chair. When her scattered senses were collected, she concluded that whoever had been in the house were there still. She resolved to go out no more until day, which, from an eastern window, she soon perceived beginning to discolour the east with a fainter blue; then purple streaks, intermingled with a dusky whiteness, ascended in pyramidal columns to the zenith; these fading slowly away, the eastern horizon became fringed with the golden spangles of early morning; a small spot of ineffable brightness succeeded, and immediately the sun burst over the verge of creation, deluging the world in a flood of unbounded light and glory. Soon as the morning had a little advanced Melissa ventured out. She proceeded with hesitating steps, carefully scrutinizing each object which met her sight. She examined all the doors; they were still fast; critically searched every room, closet, and corner, above and below. She next took a light and descended into the cellar; here her inquisition was the same. Thus did she thoroughly and strictly explore and search every part of the house, but could find nothing altered, changed or removed; no outlet, no signs of any being having been there the evening before, except herself. She then unclosed the outer door and proceeded to the gate, which she found locked as usual. She next examined the yard, the garden and all the outhouses; nothing could be discovered of any person having been recently there. She walked around by the wall, the whole circle of the inclosure; she was convinced that the unusual height thereof rendered it impossible for any one to get over it. It was constructed of several tier of hewn timbers, and both sides of it were smooth as glass. On the top long spikes were thickly driven in, sharpened at both ends. It was surrounded on the outside by a deep, wide moat, which was nearly filled with water. Over this moat, outside of the gate, was a drawbridge, which was raised, and Jeffrey had the keys of both the bridge and the gate. The events of the past night, therefore, remained inscrutable, unless, as she conjectured, her aunt was the agent who had managed this extraordinary machinery. She found Jeffrey at the house when she re-entered. “Does madam want any thing to day?” asked he. “Has my aunt returned?” inquired Melissa. “Not yet,” he replied. “How long has she been gone?” she asked. “Four days,” replied Jeffrey, after counting his fingers, “and she will not be back under four or five more.” “Has the key of the gate been constantly in your possession?” inquired she. “The keys of the gate and drawbridge,” he replied, “have not been out of my possession for a moment since Madam has been gone.” VOL. II. G 2 “Has any person been to inquire for me or my aunt,” she asked, “since I have been here?” “No, Madam,” he answered, “not a single person.” Melissa knew not what to think: she could not give up the idea of false keys: probably, by the contrivance of her father and aunt, the drawbridge had been let down, the gate opened and the house entered by means of such keys. Her father would as soon do this as to confine her in so solitary a place, nor would he abandon his purpose, if by any measures he could induce her to relinquish Alonzo and marry Bowman. An idea impressed her mind which gave her some consolation; it was possible to secure the premises so that no one could enter even by the aid of false keys. She asked Jeffrey if he would assist her that day. “In any thing you wish, Madam,” he replied. She then directed him to go to work: old staples and iron bars were found in different parts of the building, with which he secured the doors and windows, so that they could be opened only on the inside; the gate, which swang inward, was secured in the same manner. She then asked him if he was willing to leave the keys of the gate and the draw-bridge with her. “Perhaps I may as well,” said he, “for if you bar the gate and drawup the bridge, I cannot get in myself until you please to let me,” and handed her the keys. “When I come,” said he, “I will holla, and you must let me in.” This she promised to do, and Jeffrey departed.[2] [2] Of the place where Melissa was confined, as described in the foregoing pages, scarce a trace now remains. By the events of the revolution the premises fell into other hands. The mansion, outhouses and walls were torn down; the cemetery levelled, the moat filled up, the locust and elm trees cleared away; all obstructions were removed, and the yard and garden converted into a beautiful meadow. An elegant farm-house is now erected on the place where Jeffrey's hut then stood, and the neighbourhood is thinly settled. That night Melissa raised the bridge, locked and barred the gate, as also the doors and windows of the house; she likewise went again over all parts of the building, strictly searching every place, though well convinced from previous scrutiny that nothing extraordinary would be discovered; she then retired to her chamber, seated herself at a western window and watched the slow declining sun as it leisurely sank behind lofty groves. Pensive twilight spread her dusky mantle over the landscape; the western horizon glowed with the spangles of evening; deepening glooms advanced; the last beam of day faded, and the world was enveloped in night. The owl hooted solemnly in the forest, and the whipperwill sung cheerfully in the garden. Innumerous stars glittered in the firmament, intermingling their quivering lustre with the pale splendours of the milky-way. She did not retire from the window until late; then shut it and withdrew to her room, intending not to close her eyes during the night; if beings material or immaterial were to visit her, she chose not again to encounter them in darkness, or to be surprised by them when asleep. But what cause existed for fear? She had injured no one; none had she displeased, except her father, her aunt and Bowman; if by any of these the late terrifying scenes had been wrought, they were effectually precluded from repeating them, for she was well convinced that no human being could now enter the inclosure without her permission; but if supernatural agents were the actors, what had she to apprehend from them? The night passed away without any alarming circumstance, and when daylight appeared she flung herself upon the bed and slept until the morning was considerably advanced. She now felt convinced that her former conjectures were right; that it was her aunt, her father, or both, who had caused the frightful noises she had heard, a repetition of which were only prevented by the precautions she had taken. When she awoke the horizon was overclouded; it soon began to rain and continued until towards evening, when it cleared away. She went to the gate, and found all things as she had left them, then returned, fastened the doors as usual, examined all parts of the house, and again went to her chamber. She sat up until a late hour, when growing very drowsy, and convinced that she was safe and secure, concluded to retire to repose, leaving candles, however, burning in the room. Having for two nights been deprived of her usual rest, she soon fell into a slumber. Sleep had scarcely arrested her senses, when she was instantly aroused by the apparent report of a pistol, seemingly discharged close to her head. Awakened so suddenly, recollection for a time was confused and imperfect; she was only sensible of a strong, sulphureous scent; but she soon remembered leaving two candles burning, and every object was now shrouded in darkness: this alarmed her exceedingly. What could have become of the candles? They must have been extinguished or taken away. What was the noise she had just heard? What the sulphureous stench which pervaded the room? While thus reflecting in perplexity, a broad flash like that of lightning transiently illuminated her chamber, followed by a long, loud and deep roar which seemed to shake the building to its centre; it did not appear like thunder; the sound was apparently in the rooms directly over her head: perhaps however it was thunder; possibly a preceding clap had struck near the building, broken the windows, put out the lights, and filled the house with the electric effluvium. She listened for a repetition of the report; but a very different sound soon grated on her ear: a hollow, horrible groan echoed through her apartment, passing off in a faint, dying murmur: it was evident that the groan proceeded from some person in the chamber. Melissa raised her head; a tall, white form moved from the upper end of the room, glided slowly by her bed and seemed to pass off near the foot; she then heard the doors below alternately open and shut, slapping furiously and in quick succession, followed by violent noises in the rooms beneath, like the falling of heavy bodies, and the crash of furniture; clamorous voices succeeded, among which she could distinguish boisterous menaces and threatenings, and the plaintive tone of expostulation; a momentary silence ensued, when the cry of “Murder! murder! murder!” echoed through the building, followed by the report of a pistol, and shortly after by the groans of a person apparently in the agonies of death, which grew fainter and fainter until they died away in a seemingly expiring gasp: a dead silence prevailed for a few minutes, to which a loud, hoarse peal of ghastly laughter succeeded; then again all was still: but she soon heard heavy footsteps ascending the stairs to her chamber door. It was then she became terrified and alarmed beyond any former example. “Gracious Heaven defend me,” she exclaimed; “what am I coming to!” Knowing that every avenue to the inclosure was effectually secured; that all the doors and windows of the house, as also the door which opened into her chamber, were fast locked, strictly bolted and barred, and certain that all the keys were in her possession, she could not entertain the least doubt but the noises she had heard were produced by supernatural beings, and she had reason to believe, of the most mischievous nature. She was now convinced that neither her father nor her aunt could have any agency in the business, and even wished her aunt had returned. It must be exceedingly difficult to cross the moat, as the drawbridge was up; it must be still more difficult to scale the wall of the inclosure; it was impossible for any human being to get into the house, or to enter her chamber, without bursting the doors. While she lay thus ruminating in extreme agitation, momentarily expecting her ears would be assailed with some terrific sound, a pale light dimly illuminated her room; it grew brighter; she raised herself up to look towards the door; the first sight which met her eye was a most horrible object standing at a little distance from her bed-side; its form was tall and stately, wrapped in a white, folding robe, spotted with blood; the hair of its head was matted with clotted gore; a deep wound appeared to have pierced the breast, from which fresh blood flowed down the garment; its haggard face was gashed and gory; eyes fixed, glazed and glaring; lips open, teeth set, and in its hand was a bloody dagger. Melissa, uttering a shriek of terror, shrunk into bed, and in an instant the room was involved in total darkness; a freezing ague seized her limbs, and drops of chilling sweat stood upon her face. Immediately a horrid, hoarse voice burst from amidst the gloom of her apartment—“Begone! Begone from this house!” The bed on which she lay then seemed to be agitated, and directly she perceived some person crawling on to its foot. Every consideration except present safety was relinquished; instantaneously she sprang from the bed to the floor, with convulsive grasp seized the candle, flew to the fire and lighted it; she gazed wildly about the room; no new object was visible; with timid step she approached the bed, strictly searched all around and under it, but nothing strange could be found. An idea flashed across her mind to leave the house immediately and fly to Jeffrey's; this was easy, VOL. II. H as the keys of the gate and drawbridge were in her possession; she stopped not to reconsider the thought, but seizing the keys, with a candle in her hand, unlocked her chamber door, and proceeded cautiously down stairs, fearfully casting her eyes on each side as she tremblingly advanced to the outer door. She hesitated a moment: to what perils was she about to expose herself by thus venturing out at the dead of night and proceeding such a distance alone! But confident her situation could become no more hazardous, she was about to unbar the door, when she was alarmed by a deep, hollow sigh; she looked around, and saw stretched on one side of the hall the same ghastly form which had so recently appeared standing by her bedside; the same haggard countenance, the same awful appearance of murderous death! A faintness came upon her; she turned to flee to her chamber; the candle dropped from her palsied hand and all was shrouded in impenetrable darkness. Groping to find the stairs, as she came near their foot, a black object, apparently in human shape, stood before her, with eyes which resembled glowing coals, and red flames issuing from its mouth. As she stood fixed in inexpressible trepidation, a large ball of fire rolled slowly along the extended hall, and burst with an explosion which seemed to rock the building to its deepest foundations. Melissa closed her eyes and fell senseless to the floor: she revived, and reached her chamber she hardly knew how; locked her door, lighted another candle, and after again searching the room sank into a chair in a state of mind which almost deprived her of reason. Daylight soon appeared; and the cheerful sun, darting his enlivening rays through the crevices and windows of the antique mansion, revived her exhausted spirits, and dissipated in some degree the terrors which hovered about her mind. She endeavoured to reason coolly on the events of the past night, but reason could not elucidate them; not the least sound had been heard since she returned to her room; she therefore expected to discover no traits which might tend to a disclosure of those mysteries. She consoled herself only with a fixed determination to leave the desolate building. Should Jeffrey come there that day, he might be prevailed on to permit her to remain at the apartment in his house until her aunt returned. If he came not before sunset, she resolved to leave the mansion and proceed thither. After taking some refreshment she went down stairs; the doors and windows were all fast as she had left them; she again searched every room in the house, both above and below, but discovered no trace or mark of the past disturbance; not the smallest article was displaced; every thing appeared as usual. She then went to the gate; it was locked and the drawbridge was up. Again she traversed the circuit of the wall, but found no alteration, or any place where it was possible the inclosure might be entered; she visited the outbuildings, and even entered the cemetery, but perceived not the least trait or vestige which tended to explain the surprising transactions of the preceding night. She however returned to her room in a more composed frame of spirit, confident that she should not remain alone another night in that gloomy, desolate and dangerous solitude. Towards evening Melissa took her usual walk around the inclosure. It was that sea son of the year when weary summer is lapsing into the arms of sallow autumn. The day had been warm, and the light gales bore revigorating coolness on their wings, as they tremulously agitated the foliage of the western forest, or fluttered among the branches of trees surrounding the mansion. The green splendours of spring had begun to fade into a yellow lustre; the flowery verdure of the fields was changing to a russet hue. A robin chirped on a neighbouring oak, a wren chattered beneath; swallows twittered around the decayed buildings; the ludicrous mocking-bird sang sportively from the top of the highest elm, and the surrounding groves rang with the numerous changes of artless melody, while deep in the adjacent wilderness the woodcock,[3] [3] This bird is of the same plumage, possessing the same habits and propensities, and is doubtless of the same species with the common woodpecker, but much larger, weighing from four to six pounds. It has a long, sharp and strong beak, with which it readily chops large holes and cavities into dry and decaying trees, in order to extract worms and insects, which it devours. It has been known to cut a dry branch of considerable dimensions entirely off in a very short time; and while it is thus employed the chips and fragments fly from the wood as by the stroke of a hatchet. If the tree or branch happens to be hollow, the sound is heard at a great distance. It is common in the eastern states, where it is called the woodcock. Its note or call is singular, loud and strong. There is another species of bird in this country known by the same name. hammering on the hollow trunk of some dry and blasted tree, filled VOL. II. H 2 the woods with reverberant echoes. The Sound was only ruffled by the lingering breezes as they idly wandered over its surface. Long-Island, then in possession of the British troops, was thinly enveloped in smoky vapour: scattered along its shores lay the numerous small craft and larger ships of the hostile fleet. A few skiffs were passing and repassing the Sound, and several American gun-boats lay off a point which stretched out from the mainland far to the eastward. Numberless summer insects mingled their discordant strains amidst the weedy herbage. A heavy, black cloud was rising in the northwest which seemed to portend a shower, as the sonorous, distant thunder was at long intervals distinctly heard. Melissa strolled around the inclosure, contemplating the varying beauties of the scene. The images of departed joys, the days when Alonzo had participated with her in admiring the splendours of rural prospects, raised in her bosom the sigh of deep regret. Where was he now? What were his sensations? Perhaps he had been induced to believe her false or capricious; or wearied by incessant disappointment, he might have relinquished a pursuit attended with so much difficulty: or was it not more probable that his late family misfortunes, added to the mystery of her sudden disappearance, had driven him to despair, and that he was now wandering in distant lands? Could she but hear from him, it might alleviate her sorrows; but alas! she doubted of ever hearing aught that would restore her to comfort and to peace. She entered the garden and traversed the alleys, now overgrown with weeds and tufted knot-grass. The flower-beds were choaked with the low-running bramble and the tangling five-finger; tall, rank rushes, mullens and daisies had usurped the empire of the kitchen garden. The viny arbour was broken and principally gone to decay; yet the “lonely wild-rose” blushed mournfully amidst its ruins, and around the environs the wild grape hung in clusters. Passing from the garden, she involuntarily stopped at the cemetery; she paused in serious reflection: “Here,” said she, “in this house of gloom, rest in undisturbed silence my honourable ancestors, once the active tenants of yonder mansion; then, throughout these now solitary demesnes, the busy occurrences of life glided in cheerful circles; then, these moss-clad alleys and this wild, weedy garden, were the resort of the fashionable and the gay; evening music then floated over the fields, while yonder halls and apartments shone with brilliant illumination: now all is sad, solitary and dreary, the haunt of sprites and spectres of nameless terror. All that remains of the head that formed, the hand that executed and the bosom that relished this once happy scenery, is, alas! only a heap of dust.” She seated herself on a little hillock under a weeping-willow that stood near the cemetery, and watched the rising shower which slowly ascended in gloomy pomp, half hidden behind western groves, shrouding the low sun in black vapour, while coming thunders nearer and more awfully rolled. The shriek ing night-hawk[4] [4] Supposed to be the male whipperwill, well known in the New-England states, and answering to this peculiarity. soared high into the air, mingling with the lurid van of the approaching storm, which widening, more rapidly advanced, until “the heavens were arrayed in blackness.” The lightning broader and brighter flashed, hurling down its forky, streaming bolts, far in the wilderness, its flaming path followed by the volleying artillery of the skies; now bending its long, crinkling spires over the valleys, then glimmering along the summit of the hills. Convolving clouds poured smoky volumes through the expansion; a deep, hollow, distant roar announced the approach of “summoned winds;” the whole forest bowed in awful grandeur, as from its dark bosom rushed the impetuous hurricane, twisting off or tearing up by the roots the stoutest trees, and whirling the heaviest branches through the air with irresistible fury. It dashed upon the sea, tossed it into irregular mountains, or mingled its white, foamy spray with the gloom of the turbid skies. Slantways the large, heavy drops of rain began to descend. Melissa hastened to the mansion; as she reached the door a very brilliant flash of lightning, accompanied by a tremendous explosion, startled her. A thunderbolt had entered a large elm tree within the inclosure, and with horrible crash had shivered it from top to bottom. She unlocked the door and hurried to her chamber. Deep night now filled the atmosphere; the rain poured in torrents; the wind rocked the building and bellowed in the adjacent groves; the sea raged and roared; fierce lightnings rent the heavens, alternately involving the world in the sheeted flame of their many-coloured fires; thunders rolled awfully around the firmament, or burst with horrid din, bounding and reverberating among the surrounding woods, hills and valleys. It seemed nothing less than the crush of worlds sounding through the universe. Melissa walked her room, listening to the wild commotion of the elements. She feared that if the storm continued she should be compelled to pass another night in the lonely mansion; if so, she resolved not to sleep. She now suddenly recollected that in her haste to regain her chamber she had forgotten to lock the outer door; the shock she received when the lightning demolished the elm tree was the cause of this neglect; she took the candle, ran hastily down and fastened the door. When returning, she heard footsteps, and imperfectly saw the glance of something coming out of an adjoining room into the hall; supposing some ghastly object was approaching, she averted her eyes and flew to the stairs: as she was ascending them a voice behind her expressed, “Gracious Heaven!—Melissa!” The voice agitated her frame with a confused, sympathetic sensation. She turned, fixed her eyes upon the person who had spoken; unconnected ideas floated a moment in her imagination—“Eternal Powers!” she exclaimed—“Alonzo!”</field>

In hallowed silence rest, Let fragrant gales thy form with leaves invest; There, with new sweets, the lonely wild-rose bloom, And pitying strangers raise thy verdant tomb. Dwight. They were both equally surprised at so unexpected a meeting, and could scarcely credit their own senses. How Alonzo discovered her solitude; what led him to that lonely place; how he crossed the canal and scaled the wall, were queries which first arose in the mind of Melissa. He likewise could not conceive by what miracle he should find her in a remote, desolate building, which he had supposed uninhabited. With rapture he took her trembling hand; tears of joy choked their utterance. “You are wet, Alonzo,” said Melissa, at length; “we will go up to my chamber, I have a fire there, where you can dry your clothes.” “Your chamber!” replied he; “who then inhabits this house?” “No one except myself,” she answered; “I am here alone.” “Alone!” he exclaimed; “Here alone, Melissa! Good God! Tell me how—why— by what means are you here alone?” “Let us go to my room,” she answered; “and I will tell you all.” He followed to her apartment and seated himself by the fire. “You want refreshment,” said she, which was indeed the case, as he had been long without any, and was wet, hungry and weary. She immediately began to prepare supper and soon had it ready, when a comfortable repast was spread for his entertainment. And now, reader, if thou art a child of nature; if thy bosom be susceptible of refined sensibility, contemplate for a moment, Melissa and Alonzo seated at the same table, a table prepared by her own hands, in a lonely mansion, distant from society, and no one present to interrupt them. After innumerable VOL. II. I difficulties, troubles and perplexities; after serious embarrassments and a painful separation, they were once more together, and for some time every other consideration was lost. the violence of the storm had not abated; the lightning still blazed, the thunder bellowed, the wind roared, the sea raged, the rain poured, mingled with rattling hail. They heard little of it. She told him all that had happened to her since they parted, except of the strange noises and awful sights which had terrified her during her confinement in that solitary building; this she considered unnecessary and untimely in their present situation. Alonzo informed her that soon as he learned the manner in which she had been sent away, he left the house of Vincent and repaired to her father's, to see if he could not find out by some of the domestics where she was concealed. None of them knew any thing about it. He did not put himself in the way of her father, as he was apprehensive of ill treatment. He then went to several places among the relatives of the family, where he had heretofore visited with Melissa, most of whom treated him with a cautious coldness. At length he came to the house of Bergher; there he was received with the ardour of friendship. They had heard his story; Melissa had kept up a correspondence with Mrs. Bergher and Katherine; they were therefore apprized of all, except Melissa's removal from her father's house; of this they knew nothing until informed thereof by Haventon. “I am surprised at the conduct of my kinsman,” said Bergher; “for though his injunctions are like the laws of the Medes and Persians, yet I have ever believed that the welfare of his children lay nearest his heart. In the present instance he is certainly pursuing a mistaken course. I will visit him; possibly he may be induced to adopt milder measures.” He then ordered his horse, desiring Haventon to remain at his house until he made the experiment. Alonzo was entertained with the most friendly politeness by the family; he found that they were deeply interested in his favour and the welfare of Melissa. Here for the first time he saw and became acquainted with the Baron Du Ruyter, and was highly pleased with his manners. Du Ruyter, instead of returning to Germany, fired with the flame of patriotism, espoused the American cause, had been honoured with the station of general of brigade, and was soon to repair to the army. The ensuing evening Bergher returned. “It is in vain,” said he, “to reason with my kinsman: he is determined that his daughter shall marry your rival. He will not even inform me to what place he has sent her; his sister however is with her, and they must be at the residence of some of their connexions. I will dispatch my son Roderick among them, perhaps he will be able to make some discovery.” The next morning Roderick departed, and was gone five days, but could not obtain the least intelligence either of Melissa or her aunt, although he had visited almost all the relatives of the family. “There is some mystery in this affair,” said Bergher. “I am very little acquainted with Miss Martha; I have understood that she derives a decent support from her patrimonial resources, which it is said are pretty large, and that she resides alternately with her different relations. I have also been informed that my kinsman expects her fortune to come into his family in case she never marries, which in all probability she now will not, and that she in consequence holds considerable influence over him. Doubtless his daughter is concealed at some place where her aunt usually resides. I judge it cannot be long before the secret is disclosed. You, Mr. Haventon, are welcome to make my house your home; and if the object of your search can be found, she shall be treated as my daughter.” Alonzo thanked him for his friendship and proffered kindness: “I must continue,” said he, “my inquiries for Melissa; the result you shall know.” He then departed, and travelled through the neighbouring villages and adjoining towns, making at almost every house such examination as he considered necessary on the occasion. He at length arrived at the inn in the last little village where Melissa and her aunt had stopped when they went to the mansion. Here the innkeeper informed him that two ladies answering to his description had been at his house; he named the time, which was the day on which they left Bloomfield Vale. The innkeeper told him that they purchased some VOL. II. I 2 articles in the village, and drove off to the south. Alonzo then traversed the country adjoining the Sound, far to the west, and was returning eastward, when he was overtaken by the shower. No house being within sight, he resorted to the forest for shelter; from a little hilly glade in the wilderness he discovered the lonely mansion, which from its appearance he very naturally judged to be uninhabited. The tempest soon becoming severe, he thought he would endeavour to reach the house; when he arrived at the moat he found it impossible to cross it, or ascend the wall; and he stood in momentary jeopardy of his life from the falling timber, some of which was broken or torn up by the tornado, some splintered by the fiery bolts of heaven. At length a large, tall tree, which stood near him on the verge of the canal, was hurled from its foundation, and fell with hideous crash across the moat, its top lodging on the wall; he scrambled up on the trunk, and advanced along on the fallen tree; by the incessant glare of lightning he was able to see distinctly; the top of the tree was partly broken by the force of the fall, and hung over the inclosure; by these branches he let himself down into the yard, proceeded to the house, found the door open, which Melissa had left so in her fright, and entered into one of the rooms, where he proposed to stay until at least the storm was over, still supposing the house unoccupied, until the noise of locking the door, and the light of the candle, drew him from the room, when to his infinite surprise he discovered Miss Bloomfield, as previously related. Melissa listened to this narrative with varied emotion. The fixed obduracy of her father, the generous conduct of the Berghers, the constancy of Alonzo, filled her heart with inexpressible sensations. She foresaw that her sufferings were not shortly to end. She knew not when her sorrows would close. Haventon was shocked at the alteration which appeared in the features of Melissa. The rose had faded from her cheek, except when transiently suffused with a hectic flush. A livid paleness sat upon her countenance, and her fine form was rapidly wasting. It was easy to foresee that the floods of grief which overwhelmed her, unless shortly removed, would soon sink her to the tomb. The storm had now passed into the regions of the east; the wind and rain had ceased, the lightning more unfrequently flashed, and the thunder rolled at a distance. The hours moved hastily; day would soon appear. Hitherto they had thought only of the present moment; it was time to think of the future. After the troubles they had experienced, after so fortunate a meeting, they could not endure the idea of another and an immediate separation; and yet immediately separate they must. It would not be safe for Alonzo to stay there even until the rising of the sun, unless he was concealed; and of what use could it be for him to remain there in concealment? In this dilemma there was but one expedient. “Permit me,” said Alonzo, “to remove you from this solitary confinement. Your health is impaired. To you your father is no longer a parent; he has steeled his bosom to paternal affection; he has banished you from his house, placed you under the tyranny of others, and confined you in a lonely, desolate building, far from the sweets of society, and this only because you cannot heedlessly renounce a most solemn contract, formed under his eye and sanctioned by his immediate approbation. Pardon me, Melissa, I would not wish unjustly to censure your father, but allow me to say, that after such treatment you are absolved from implicit obedience to his rigorous, cruel and stern commands. It will therefore be considered a duty you owe to your preservation, if you suffer me to remove you from the unusual severity with which you are oppressed.” Melissa sighed, and wiping a tear which fell from her eye: “Unqualified obedience to my parents,” said she, “I ever considered the first of duties, and have religiously practised thereon. But where, Alonzo, would you remove me?” “To any place you shall appoint,” he answered. “Alas! I have nowhere to go,” she replied. “If you will permit me to name the place,” said he, “I will mention Bergher's: he will espouse your cause, and if conciliation be possible, will reconcile you to your father. You are intimate with the family, and are distantly connected. They are all your friends, and sincerely sympathize in your sufferings. It was their express desire, if you could be found, to have you brought to their house. Your removal can be effected without its being known that I had any agency in the business. There you can remain either in secret or openly, as you shall choose, until some change in our affairs takes place. Be governed by me in this, and in all things I will obey you thereafter. I will then submit to the future events of fate; but I cannot, Melissa, I cannot leave you in this doleful place.” Melissa arose and walked the room in extreme agitation. What did her duty enjoin? She had indeed determined to quit the house for reasons of which Alonzo knew nothing. But should she leave it in the way previously contemplated, she would probably be immediately remanded back, more strictly guarded, and more severely treated. To continue there under existing circumstances, would be impossible, and long to exist. She therefore came to a determination—“I will go,” she said, “to Bergher's.” It was then concluded that Alonzo should proceed to the house of Vincent, apprize that family of the circumstances, procure a carriage and return at eleven o'clock the next night. Melissa was to leave the drawbridge down and the gate open. If Jeffrey should come to the house the succeeding day, she would persuade him to let her still keep the keys. But it was possible her aunt might return: this would render the execution of the scheme more hazardous and difficult: a signal was therefore agreed on; if Martha should be there, a candle was to be set at the window fronting the gate, in the chamber; if not, it would be placed against a similar window in the room below. In the first case, Haventon was to rap loudly at the door, Melissa would then run down under pretence of seeing who was there, fly with Alonzo to the carriage, and leave her aunt to scrape acquaintance with the ghosts and goblins of the old mansion. For even if Martha should return, which was extremely doubtful, Melissa thought she could contrive to let down the bridge and unlock the gate in the evening, without her aunt's knowledge. At any rate, she was determined not to let the keys go out of her hands, unless they were forced from her, until she had escaped from that horrid and dreary place. Had Alonzo been apprized of the terrors she had there encountered, what would have been his sensations! but these she wisely concealed. Daylight began to break from the east, and Haventon prepared to depart. Melissa accompanied him to the bridge, which they let down; he passed over, and she slowly withdrew, both frequently turning to look back. At the gate she paused; Alonzo stopped also; she waved a white handkerchief, and he bowed in answer to the sign. She then leisurely entered and slowly closed the gate. Alonzo could not forbear climbing up into a tree to catch another glance of her as she passed up the avenue. With lingering step he saw her move along, soon receding from his view in the grey twilight of a misty morning. He then descended and hastily proceeded on his journey. Streams of glory now painted the eastern skies. The glittering day-star, harbinger of light, began to transmit its retrocessive lustre. Thin scud flew swiftly over the moon's decrescent form. Low, hollow winds murmured among the bushes, or brushed the limpid drops from intermingling foliage. The firefly sank, feebly twinkling, amidst the weedy herbage of the fields. The dusky shadows of night fled to the deep glens and rocky caverns of the wilderness. The American lark soared high in the air, consecrating its matin lay to morn's approaching splendours. The woodlands began to ring with native melody. Forest tops, on high mountains, caught the sun's first ray, which widening and extending, soon spangled the landscape with brilliants of a thousand various dies. As Haventon came out of the fields near the road, he saw two persons passing in an open chaise; they suddenly stopped, earnestly gazing at him: they were wrapped in long riding-cloaks, and it could not be distinguished from their dress whether they were men or women. He stood not to notice them, but made the best of his way to the residence of the Vincents, where he arrived about noon. Rejoiced to find that he had discovered Melissa, they applauded the plan of her removal and assisted him in obtaining a carriage. A chaise was procured, and he set out to return, promising to see Vincent again, soon as he had removed Melissa to Bergher's. He VOL. II. K made such use of his time as to reach the mansion at the hour appointed. He found the draw-bridge down, the gate open, and saw, as had been agreed upon, the light at the lower window, glimmering through the branches of trees. He was therefore assured that Melissa was alone. His heart beat; a joyful tremour seized his frame: Miss Bloomfield was soon to be under his protection, for a short time at least. He drove up to the house, sprang out of the carriage, and fastened his horse to a locust tree; the door was open, he went in, flew lightly up stairs, entered her chamber—Melissa was not there! A small fire was blazing on the hearth, and a candle burning on the table. He stood petrified with amazement; then gazed around in anxious solicitude. What could have become of her? It was impossible, he thought, but that she must be there. Had she been removed by fraud or force, the signal-candle would not have been at the window. Perhaps in a frolicksome moment, she had concealed herself, for no other purpose than to cause him a little perplexity. He therefore took a candle and searched every corner of the chamber, and every room in the house, not even neglecting the garret and the cellar. He then placed the candle in a lantern, hastened into the yard, and examined the outhouses; he next went round the garden and the inclosure, strictly exploring and investigating every place, but he found her not. He repeatedly and loudly called her by name; he was answered only by the solitary echoes of the wilderness. Again he returned to the house, traversed the rooms, there also calling on the name of Melissa; his voice reverberated from the walls, dying away in solemn murmurs in the distant, empty apartments. Thus did he continue his anxious scrutiny, alternately, in the house and the inclosure, until day, but no traces could be discovered, nothing seen or heard of Melissa. What had become of her he could not form even a conjecture. Nothing was removed from the house: the beds, the chairs, the table, all the furniture remained in the same condition as when he was there the night before; the candle, as had been agreed upon, was at the window, and another burning on the table; it was therefore evident that she could not have been long gone when he arrived. By what means she had thus suddenly disappeared was a most deep and inscrutable mystery. When the sun had arisen he once more repeated his inquisitive search, but with the same effect. He then, in extreme vexation and disappointment, flung himself into the chaise, and drove from the mansion. Frequently did he look back at the building, anxiously did he scrutinize every surrounding and receding object. A thrill of pensive recollection vibrated through his frame as he passed the gate, and the keen, agonizing pangs of blasted hope, pierced his heart, as his carriage rolled over the bridge. Once more he cast a “longing, lingering look” upon the premises behind, sacred only for the treasure they lately possessed, then sank backward in his seat, and was dragged slowly away. He had been informed by Melissa that Jeffrey's hut was situate about one mile north from the old mansion. When he came out near the road he left his horse and carriage, after securing them, went in search of the cottage, and soon discovered it. He knocked at the door, which was opened by Jeffrey, whom Alonzo readily knew, from the portrait Melissa had drawn of him. The man started in amazement. “Understanding,” said Alonzo, “that you have the charge of the old building in yonder field, I have come to know if you can inform me what has become of the lady who has been confined there.” “Confined!” said he, “I did not know she was confined.” Recollecting himself, “I mean the young lady who has lately resided there with her aunt,” replied Alonzo. “She was there last night,” answered the other, “but old Madam has gone into the country and has not returned.” Haventon then told him of the situation of the mansion, and that the young lady was gone likewise. Jeffrey said she was there about sunset and according to her request he had left the keys of the gate and bridge with her. He desired Alonzo to tarry there until he ran to the building. He returned in about half an hour: “she is gone, sure enough,” said he; “but how or where, it is impossible for me to guess.” Convinced that he knew nothing VOL. II. K 2 of the matter, Alonzo left him and returned to Vincent's. Vincent and his lady were much surprised at Alonzo's account of Melissa's sudden disappearance, and they wished to ascertain whether her father's family knew any thing of the circumstance. Social intercourse had been suspended between the families of Vincent and Col. Bloomfield, as the latter had taxed the former with improperly endeavouring to promote the views of Haventon. They therefore procured a neighbouring woman to visit Mrs. Bloomfield, to see if any information could be obtained concerning Melissa; but the old lady had learnt nothing since her departure with Martha, who had never yet returned. Alonzo left Vincent's, and went to Bergher's. He informed them of all that had happened since he was there, of which, before, they had heard nothing. At the houses of Bergher and Vincent, he resided some time, while they made the most diligent search to discover Melissa, but not a particle of information could be obtained. He then travelled into various parts of the country, making such inquiries as caution dictated, of all whom he saw, but he found none who could give him the least intelligence of his lost Melissa. In the course of his wanderings he again passed near the old mansion: he felt an inclination once more to visit it; he proceeded over the bridge, which was down, but found the gate locked. He therefore hurried back and called on Jeffrey. On questioning him whether he had yet heard any thing of the young lady and her aunt, “All I know of the matter,” said Jeffrey, “is, that two days after you was here, old Madam came back with a strange gentleman, and ordered me to go and fetch the furniture away from the room they had occupied. I asked her what had become of young Madam. She told me that young Madam had behaved improperly, and she found fault with me for leaving the keys in her possession, though I did not know that any harm could come of it. From the discourse which my wife and I afterwards overheard between old Madam and the strange gentleman, I understood that young Madam had been sent to reside with some friend or relation at a great distance, because her father wanted her to marry a man, and she wanted to marry somebody else.” From Jeffrey's plain and simple narrative, Alonzo concluded that Melissa had been removed by her father's orders, or through the agency or instigation of her aunt. Whether his visit to the mansion had been somehow discovered or suspected, or whether she was removed by some preconcerted or antecedent plan, he could not conjecture. Still, the situation in which he found things on the night he went to convey her away, left an inexplicable impression on his mind. He could in no manner account how the candle should be placed at the window according to agreement, unless it had been done by herself, and if so, how had she so suddenly disappeared? He asked Jeffrey where Melissa's aunt now was. “She left here yesterday morning,” he answered, “with the strange gentleman I mentioned, on a visit to some of her friends.” “Was the strange gentleman you speak of her brother?” asked Alonzo. “I believe not,” replied Jeffrey, smiling, and winking at his wife; “I know not who he was; somebody that Madam seems to like pretty well.” “Have you the care of the old house?” asked Alonzo. “Yes,” answered he; “I have the keys; I will go with you there if you wish; perhaps you will like to buy it; Madam said yesterday she intended to sell it.” Alonzo told him he had no thoughts of purchasing, thanked him for his information and departed. Convinced now that Melissa was removed by the agency of her persecutors, he compared the circumstances of Jeffrey's story. “She had been sent to reside with some friend or relation at a great distance.” This great distance he believed to be New-London,” and her friend or relation, Glenford, her cousin, with whom she would be safe, and Bowman have an opportunity of renewing his addresses. Under these impressions he did not long hesitate what course to adopt; he determined to repair to New-London immediately. In pursuance of this design he went to his father's. He found the old gentleman with his man contentedly tilling his farm, and his mother cheerfully attending to household affairs, as their narrow circumstances would not permit her to keep a maid without embarrassment. Haventon's soul sickened on comparing the present state of his family with its former affluence; but it was an unspeakable consolation to see his aged parents contented and happy in their humble situation, and though the idea could not pluck the thorn from his bosom, yet it tended temporarily to assuage the anguish of the wound. “You have been long gone, my son,” said his father; “I scarcely knew what had become of you. Since I have been a farmer I know little of what is going on in the world; and indeed we were never happier in our lives: after stocking and paying for my farm, and purchasing the requisites for my business, I have considerable money at command. We live frugally, and realize the blessings of health, comfort and contentment; our only disquietude is on your account, Alonzo: your affair with Miss Bloomfield, I suppose, is not so favourable as you could wish; but despair not, my son; hope is the harbinger of fairer prospects; rely on Providence, which never deserts those who submissively bow to the justice of its dispensations.” Unwilling to disturb the serenity of his parents, Alonzo did not disclose to them his troubles; he answered that probably affairs would yet take a favourable turn; but that as in the present state of his mind he thought change of situation might be of advantage, he asked liberty to travel for some little time. To this his father consented, and offered him a part of the money he had on hand, which Alonzo refused, saying he did not expect to be long gone, and his resources had not yet failed him. He immediately sold off his books, horses, carriages, and his wardrobe, the insignia of his better days, but now useless appendages, from which he raised no inconsiderable sum. He then took a tender and affectionate leave of his parents and set out for New-London. He journeyed along with a heavy heart and in an enfeebled frame of spirits. Through disappointment, vexation and the fatigues he had endured while wandering about for so long a time in search of Melissa, despondency had seized upon his mind and indisposition upon his body. He put up the first night within a few miles of New-Haven, and as he passed through that town the next morning, the scenes of early life in which he had there been an actor, moved in melancholy succession over his recollection. That day he grew more indisposed; he experienced an unusual languor, listlessness and debility; chills, followed by hot flashes, succeeded; then heavy pains in the head and back, with incessant and intolerable thirst. It was near night when he reached Killingworth, where he halted, as he felt unable to go farther; he called for a bed, and through the night was racked with severe pain, and scorched with a burning fever. The next morning he requested that the physician of the town might be called, who came and ordered a prescription which gave his patient some relief; and by strict attention he was able in a few weeks to pursue his journey. He arrived at New-London, and took lodgings with a private family of the name of Wyllys, in a retired part of the town. The first object was to ascertain whether Melissa was at her cousin's. But how should he obtain this information; he knew no persons in the town except it were those whom he had reason to suppose were leagued against him. Should he go to the house of her cousin it might prove an injury to her if she was there, and could answer no valuable purpose if she was not. The evening after he arrived, he wrapped himself up in his cloak, and walked towards Glenford's house: he stopped when he came against it to see if he could make any discoveries. As people were passing and repassing the street, he got over into a small inclosure, and stood under a tree about thirty yards from the building; he had not long occupied this station before a lady came to the chamber window, which was flung up, opposite to the place where he stood; she leaned out, looked earnestly around for a few minutes, then shut it and retired. She had brought a candle into the room, but did not bring it to the window, of course he could not distinguish her features so as to identify them. He knew it was not Mrs. Glenford, and from her appearance he believed it to be Melissa. Again the window opened, and again the same lady appeared; she took a seat at a little distance within the room, and reclined with her head upon one hand, her arm appearing to be supported by a toilet or table. Alonzo's heart beat violently; he now had a side view of her face, and was more VOL. II. L than ever convinced that it was Melissa; her delicate features, pale and dejected as when he last saw her; her brown hair, falling in artless circles around her neck, her arched eyebrows and pensive aspect. He moved towards the house with a design if possible to draw her attention, and should it really prove to be Melissa, to discover himself; he had proceeded but a few steps before she arose, shut the window, retired, and the light disappeared. He waited a considerable time, but she came no more. Supposing she had retired for the night, he slowly withdrew, chagrined at his disappointment, yet pleased with the discovery he had made. The people with whom Haventon had taken lodgings were fashionable and respectable. The following afternoon they had appointed to visit a friend, and invited him to accompany them; when they named the family where their visit was intended, he found it was Glenford's; he therefore declined going under pretence of business; he however waited with anxiety for their return, hoping he should be able to learn by their conversation whether Melissa was there or not. When they returned he made some inquiries respecting the families in town, until the discourse turned upon Glenford's. “The young lady who resides there,” said Mrs. Wyllys, “is undoubtedly in a confirmed decline; she will never recover.” Alonzo started, deeply agitated: “Is the lady a relative of the family?” he asked. “She is sister to Glenford's wife,” answered Mr. Wyllys; “her father lives in Newport, and she has come here with the view of amending her health.” “Do you not think,” said Mrs. Wyllys, “that she resembles Miss Bloomfield, their cousin, who resided there some time ago?” “Very much, indeed,” replied her husband, “only she is not so beautiful.” Again was Alonzo disappointed, and again did he experience a melancholy pleasure: the previous evening he trusted he had discovered Melissa, but to find her in a hopeless decline was worse than that she should remain undiscovered. “It is reported,” said Mrs. Wyllys, “that Miss Bloomfield has been on the verge of matrimony, but that the treaty was somehow broken off; perhaps Bowman will renew his addresses, should this be the case.” “Bowman has other business than addressing the ladies,” answered Mr. Wyllys; “he has marched to the lines near New-York with his new-raised company of volunteers.” From this discourse Haventon perceived Melissa was not the person he had seen at her cousin's the preceding evening, and that she was not there; and also that Bowman had left the town. Where to search next, or what course to pursue, he could not determine. The ensuing morning he arose early and wandered about the town. As he passed by the house of Glenford he saw the lady who had appeared at the window, walking in the garden; her air, her figure, had very much the appearance of Melissa, but the lineaments of her countenance, when viewed by the light of day, were widely dissimilar. Alonzo felt no strong curiosity farther to examine her features, but passing on, returned to his lodgings. How he was now to proceed he could not readily decide. To return home appeared as useless as to tarry where he was. For many weeks had he travelled and searched every place where he thought it probable Melissa might be found; both among her relatives and elsewhere, the strictest inquiries had been made; he had used every effort to obtain some clue to her removal from the old mansion, but could learn nothing but what he had been told by Jeffrey. If his friends should even find her, they could not inform him thereof, as no one knew where he was. Would it not therefore be best for him to return and consult with those friends, and if nothing had been heard of her, pursue some other mode of investigation? He could at least leave directions where he might be written to, in case they should have any thing whereof to apprize him. An incident tended to confirm this resolution. He one night dreamed that he was sitting in a strange house, reflecting on his present situation, when Melissa suddenly entered. VOL. II. L 2 Her countenance was pale, sickly and dejected; her elegant form had wasted away, her eyes were sunk, her cheeks fallen, her lips livid. He fancied it to be night: she held a candle in her hand; smiling languidly upon him, she turned and went out, beckoning to him as she retired: he thought he immediately arose and followed her; she glided through several winding rooms till finally he lost sight of her, and the light gradually fading away, he was involved in deep darkness; he groped along, and at length saw a faint, distant glimmer, the course of which he pursued until he came into an extensive apartment hung with black tapestry, and illuminated by a number of bright torches; in one corner thereof appeared a hearse, on which some person was laid; he went up to it; the first object that arrested his attention was the lovely form of Melissa, shrouded in the sable vestments of death! Cold and lifeless, stretched upon the hearse, beautiful even in dissolution. The dying smile of complacency had not yet deserted her cheek: the music of her voice had ceased; her fine eyes were closed for ever; animation no longer enlightened her features, but loveliness was still there. Insensible to objects in which she once delighted; to afflictions which had blasted her youth and blooming prospects, and drained the streams of life, she lay like blossomed trees of spring, overthrown by rude and boisterous winds. The deep groans which convulsed the distracted bosom, and shook the trembling frame of Alonzo, broke the delusive charm; he awoke, rejoiced to find it but a dream, though it impressed his mind with doleful and portentous forebodings and apprehensions. It was long before he could again close his eyes to sleep; he at length fell into a slumber, and again he dreamed. He fancied himself with Melissa at the house of her father, who had consented to their union, and that the marriage ceremony was soon to be performed. He thought she appeared as in her most fortunate and sprightly days, before the darts of adversity and the thorns of affliction had wounded her heart. Her father seemed to be divested of all his awful sternness, and received him graciously and with complacency. His own parents were there also, and apparently happy. A large concourse of his former friends were assembled; Edgar was among them, who taking the hand of Melissa, placed it in Alonzo's. He awoke, and the horrors of his former dream were dissipated by the happy influences of the latter. “Who knows,” he said, “but this may be the case; but that the sun of peace may yet dispel the glooms of these afflictive hours?” He arose, determined to return home in a few days. He went out and enjoyed his morning walk in a more composed frame of spirits than he had for some time experienced: he returned, and as he was entering the door, saw the weekly newspaper of the town, which had been published that morning and which the carrier had just thrown into the hall. The family had not yet arisen. He took the paper, carried it to his chamber, and opened it to read the news of the day; he ran his eye hastily over it, and was about to lay it aside, when the obituary arrested his attention, by a display of broad black lines. The first article he read therein was as follows: “DIED, of a consumption, on the 26th ult. at Bloomfield Hill, near Charleston, South-Carolina, where she had recently arrived from Connecticut, Miss Melissa Bloomfield, the amiable and only daughter of Col. Bloomfield, in the 19th year of her age.” The paper dropped from his palsied hand— a sudden faintness came upon him—the room grew dark—he staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. What distant thunders rend the skies! What clouds of smoke in columns rise! What means this dreadful roar! Shock after shock assails my ear, And, lo! two hostile ships appear, Red lightnings round them pour. Freneau. The incidents of our story will here produce a pause.—The fanciful class of our readers may be ready to cast it aside in chagrin and disappointment. “Such an event,” may they say, “we were not prepared to expect. After so many and such various trials of heart; after innumerable difficulties vanquished, almost invincible obstacles removed, and insuperable barriers surmounted; after attending the hero and heroine of your tale through the diversified scenes of anxiety, suspense, hope, disappointment, expectation, joy, sorrow, anticipated bliss, sudden and disastrous woe; after elevating them to the threshold of happiness, then, by the premature death of one, to plunge the other, instantaneously, in deep and irretrievable despair, must not, cannot be right. Your history will hereafter become languid and spiritless; the subject will be uninteresting, the theme unengaging, since the geni which animated and enlivened it, is gone for ever.” Reader of sensibility, reflect.—Are we not detailing facts? Shall we gloss them over with false colouring? Must we describe things as they are, or as they are not? Shall we draw with the pencil of nature, or of art? Do we indeed paint life as it is, or as it is not? Cast thine eyes, reader, over the ephemeral circle of passing and fortuitous events; view the change of contingencies; mark well the varied and shifting scenery in the great drama of Time; seriously contemplate Nature in her operations; minutely examine the entrance, the action, and the exit of characters on the stage of existence; then say, if disappointment, distress, misery and calamitous woe, are not the inalienable portion of the susceptible bosom. Say, if the possession of refined feelings be desirable, the lot of Nature's children enviable; whether to these, through life, the sprinklings of comfort are sufficient to give a zest to the bitter banquets of adversity; whether, indeed, sorrow, sighing, and tears, are not the inseparable attendants of all those whose hearts are the repositories of tender affections and pathetic sympathies. But what says the moralist?—“Portray life as it is; delude not the senses by deceptive appearances. Arouse your hero; call to his aid stern philosophy and sober reason; they will dissipate the rainbow glories of unreal pleasure, and banish the glittering meteors of unsubstantial happiness: or if these fail, lead him to the mild presence of holy religion; she will regulate the fires of fancy, and assuage the tempest of the passions; she will illuminate the dark wilderness, and smooth the thorny paths of life; will point him to worlds where sorrows never approach, to joys beyond the tomb, and pour the balm of consolation and serenity over his wounded soul.” Shall we indeed arouse Alonzo? Alas! to what pathos of grief, what sublimity of wretchedness must we awake him! To a world, void and cheerless to his heart, desolate and dreary to his soul. Alonzo revived—“Why am I,” he exclaimed, “recalled to this dungeon of torment! Why was not my spirit permitted to take its flight to regions where my guardian angel has gone? Why am I cursed with memory!—O that I might be blessed with forgetfulness! But why think of blessings? Heaven never had one in store for me. Where are fled my anticipated joys? To the bosom, the dark bosom of the oblivious tomb! There lie all the graces worthy of love in life; all the virtues deserving lamentation in death. There rests perfection—perfection has here been found, and, Oh! for ever lost! Was she not all that even Heaven could demand—fair, lovely, holy, virtuous? Her tender solicitudes—her enrapturing endearments—her soul-inspiring blandishments; gone—irrevocably gone! That celestial form—that discriminate mind— unsullied as light—chaste as seraphs; a prey to worms—mingled with incorporeal shadows— regardless of former inquietudes or delights; regardless of the keen anguish which now wrings tears of blood from my despairing heart! Eternal Disposer of events! if virtue be thy special care, why is the fairest flower in the garden of innocence and purity, blasted like a noxious weed! Why is the brightest gem of excellence trampled in the dust like a worthless pebble?—Why is Melissa hurried to the tomb!” Thus raved Alonzo, VOL. II. M it was evident that delirium had partially seized his intellect. He arose and flung himself on the bed, in indiscribable agony. “And what, alas!” he again exclaimed, “now remains for me! Existence, and unparalleled misery. The consolation even of death, is denied me! O that I were an insect, that the first passing foot might crush me! then could I die, and be with Melissa.—But she—Ah! where is she? Oh! reflection insupportable! insufferable consideration! Must that heavenly frame putrify, moulder, and crumble into dust! Must the loathsome spider nestle on her snowy bosom! the odious reptile riot on her delicate limbs! the worm revel amidst the roses of her cheek, fatten on her temples, and bask in the lustre of her eyes!—Great God! what a thought! Alas! the lustre has been dimmed in death; the bloom decayed, the harmony of her voice has ceased, the graces —the elegancies of form—the innumerable delicacies of air—all are gone, and I am left in a state of misery which defies mitigation or comparison. Exhausted by excess of grief, he now lay in stupifying agony until he was summoned to breakfast; he told the servant he was indisposed, and requested he might not be disturbed. Mr. Wyllys and his lady came up, anxious to yield him any assistance in their power, and advised him to call a physician; he thanked them, but said it was unnecessary; he only wanted rest. His extreme distress of mind brought on a relapse of the fever from which he had but partially recovered. For several days he continued in a very dangerous and doubtful state. A physician was called, contrary to his choice or knowledge, as most part of the time his mind was delirious and his sensation imperfect: this was probably the cause of baffling the disorder; he was in a measure insensible to his woes; he did not oppose the prescriptions of the physician; the fever abated, nature triumphed over disease of body, he slowly recovered, but the malady of his mind was not removed. He contemplated on the past. “I fear,” said he, “I have murmured against the wisdom of Providence. Forgive, O merciful Creator! forgive the frenzies of distraction!” He now recollected that Melissa once told him she had an uncle who resided at Charleston, in South Carolina: thither he supposed she had been sent by her father when she was removed from the old mansion, in order to prevent his having access to her, and with a view to compel her to marry Bowman. Her appearance indicated a deep decline when he last saw her. “There,” said he, “far removed from friends and acquaintance— there did she languish, there did she die, a victim to excessive grief and cruel parental persecution!” Soon as he was able to leave his room, he walked out one evening, and in deep contemplation roved he knew not whither. The moon shone brilliantly from her throne of glory; the chill, heavy dews of autumn glittered on the decaying verdure. The Kadeatt [5] [5] Local names given to certain American insects, from their sound. They are well known in various parts of the United States; generally make their appearance about the end of August, and continue until destroyed by the frest. The notes of the first are hoarse, sprightly and discordant: of the last, solemn, melodious, and mournfully pleasing. They commence singing towards the close of day, and continue till late in the evening, and sometimes throughout the night. croaked hoarsely among the trees; the Dirkle [5] sang mournfully in the grass. Alonzo heard them not; he was insensible to all external objects, until he had imperceptibly wandered to the ROCK on the point of the beach, verging the Sound, to which he once attended Melissa from the house of Glenford. Had the whole artillery of heaven exploded in sheeted flame from the skies—had raging winds hurled the roaring waves over the tops of mountains—had an instantaneous earthquake burst beneath his feet, his frame would not have been so shocked, his soul so agitated! Sudden as the blaze darts from electric clouds, was he aroused to a lively sense of blessings entombed! The memory of departed joys passed with rapidity over his imagination; his first meeting with Melissa; the evening he attended her to that place; her frequent allusions to the scenery there displayed, when they were traversing the fields, or reclining in the bower on her favourite hill; in fine, all the vicissitudes through which they had passed, were recalled to his mind. His fancy saw her—felt her gently leaning on VOL. II. M 2 his arm, while he tremblingly pressed her hand. Again he saw smiling health crimsoning the lilies of her cheek; again he perceived the bright soul of exquisite feeling sparkling in her eye—the air of ease—the graces of attitude —her brown hair circling the borders of her snowy robe: again was he enraptured by the melody of her voice: once more would he have been happy, had not fancy inverted the scene—but alas! she shifted the curtain—he saw Melissa stretched on the sable hearse, wrapped in the dreary vestments of the grave —the roses withered—the lilies faded—motionless—the graces fled—her eyes fixed, and sealed in the glaze of death! Spontaneously he sank upon his knees, and thus poured forth the overcharged burden of his anguished bosom: “Infinite Ruler of all events! Great Sovereign of this ever changing world! Omnipoten Controller of vicissitudes! Omniscient Dispenser of destinies! The beginning—the progression—the end, are thine. Unsearchable are thy purposes! mysterious thy movements! inscrutable thy operations! An atom of thy creation, wildered in the mazes of ignorance and unparalleled affliction, would bow to thy decrees. Surrounded with impenetrable glooms—unable to scrutinize the past—incompetent to explore the future—fain would he say—Thy will be done!—And O, that it might be consistent with that high will, to call this atom from regions of wretchedness and woe, to worlds of light and glory, where his only consolation is gone!” Thus prayed the heart-broken Alonzo. It was indeed a worldly prayer, but perhaps as pure and as acceptable as many of our modern professors would have made on a similar occasion. He arose, and repaired to his lodgings. One determination only he had now fixed upon—to bury himself and his griefs from all with whom he had formerly been acquainted. Why should he return to scenes of former anxiety, comfort and inquietude, where every countenance tended to renew his mourning; where every door would be inscribed with a memento mori, and where every object would he shrouded in crape! He therefore turned his attention to the army; but the army was far distant, and he was too feeble to prosecute a journey of such an extent. A convoy was at that time preparing from various parts of the United States for the protection of our European trade; they were to rendezvous at a certain station, and thence proceed with the merchantmen under their care to the ports of France and Holland, where our commerce principally centred, and return with some other mercantile fleet in charge. One of these ships of war was then nearly fitted out at New-London. Haventon offered himself to the captain, who, pleased with his appearance, gave him the station of commander of marines. Alonzo prepared himself with all speed for the voyage. He sought, he wished no acquaintance. His only place of resort, except to his lodgings and the ship, was to Melissa's rock; there he bowed as to the shrine of her spirit, and there he consecrated his devotions. As he was one day passing through the town, a gentleman stepped out of an adjoining house and accosted him: he immediately recognized the person to be Glenford, whose dress of full mourning sufficiently indicated that he had been apprized of Melissa's death. Glenford invited Haventon to his house, who could not complaisantly refuse the invitation; he therefore accepted it, and passed an hour with him, from whom he learnt that Melissa had been sent to her uncle's at Charleston for the recovery of her health, as Glenford understood, where she died. “Her premature death,” said he, has borne so heavily upon her aged father, that it is feared he will not long survive.” “Well may it wring his bosom,” thought Alonzo; “how can his conscience ever be at peace!” Whether Glenford had been informed of the particulars of Alonzo's unfortunate attachment, was not known, as he said nothing on the subject; neither did he inquire into Haventon's prospects; he only invited him to call again. Alonzo thanked him, but replied it would be doubtful, as he should shortly leave town. He made no one acquainted with his intentions. The day at length arrived when the ship was to sail, and Haventon to leave the shores of America. They spread their canvas to propitious gales; the breezes rushed from their woody coverts, and majestically wafted them from the harbour. Slowly the land receded; fields, forests, hills, mountains, towns and villages leisurely withdrew, until they were mingled in one common mass; the ocean opening, expanded and widened, presenting to the astonished eyes of the untried mariner its wilderness of waters. Near sunset Alonzo ascended the mast to take a last view of a country once so dear, but whose charms were now lost for ever. The land still appeared like a semicircular border of dark green velvet on the edge of a convex mirror; the sun sank in fleecy golden vapour behind it; it soon dwindled to discoloured and irregular spots, which seemed like objects floating amidst the blue mists of distance, on the verge of the main, and immediately all was lost beneath the spherical, watery surface. Alonzo fixed his eyes as nearly as his judgment could direct towards Melissa's favourite rock, till nothing but sea was discoverable. With a heart-parting sigh he then descended. They had now launched into the illimitable world of billows, and the sable wings of night brooded over the boundless main. A new scene opened to Alonzo in the wonders of the mighty deep. The sun rising from and setting in the ocean; the widespread region of watery waste, now smooth as polished glass, now urged into irregular, rolling hillocks, then swelled to “Blue, tumbling billows, topp'd with foam,” or gradually rising into mountainous waves. Often would he traverse the deck amidst the still hours of midnight, when the moon silvered over the liquid surface: “Bright luminary of the lonely hour,” he would say, “that now shedest thy mild and placid ray on the woe-worn head of fortune's fugitive, dost thou not also pensively shine upon the sacred and silent grave of my Melissa?” Favourable breezes wafted them for many days over the bosom of the Atlantic. At length the atmosphere indicated a storm; the wind began to blow strongly from the south-west, and soon came on a violent gale; the “dingy scud” first flew swiftly along the sky; then dark and heavy clouds filled the atmosphere, mingling with the topgallant streamers of the ship. Night hovered over the ocean, rendered horrible by the intermitting blaze of lightning, the awful crash of thunder, and the deafening roar of winds and waves. The sea was rolled into mountains, capped with foaming fire. Now the ship was soaring among the thunders of heaven, now sinking in the abyss of waters. The storm dispersed the fleet, so that when it abated the vessel in which Alonzo sailed was alone; they, however, kept on their course of destination, after repairing their rigging, which had been considerably disordered by the violence of the gale. The next morning they discovered a sail which they fondly hoped might prove to be one of their own fleet, and accordingly made for it. The chase shortened sail, and towards noon, wore round and bore down upon them, when they perceived that it was not one of their convoy. It appeared to be of about equal force and dimensions with those of their own ship; they therefore, in order to prepare for the worst, got ready with all speed for action. They slowly approached each other, manœuvring for the advantage, till the strange ship ran up British colours, and fired a gun, which was immediately answered by the other, under the flag of the United States. They now found her to be a forty-four gun frigate; the American carried but forty. The cannonade shortly became general, nor was it long before a close and severe action took place. The roar of cannon, the crash of musketry, the shouts of the combatants, the groans of the wounded and dying, inspired Alonzo's bosom with the ardour of battle. He was fighting in the cause of freedom and his country. Both ships were completely enveloped in smoke and flame. The main and mizzenmasts of the British frigate went by the board, as did also the foremast of the American ship. At length Haventon heard the command of his captain, to “Board!” Instantly the Briton was laid along side, and seized by grapplings. Then Destruction rioted on human carcases; then Slaughter swam in gore. Alonzo, fixing a stern eye on death, drew his sword, and rushed into the midst of the conflict. The Americans sprang over the sides of the British vessel; a terrible contest ensued, but they were driven back with loss, and in their turn boarded by the English, who were instantly cut to pieces. Pikes contended with bayonets, and swords clashed upon daggers. The decks were piled with carnage, and the scuppers spouted blood! Again VOL. II. N blazed the musketry, again thundered the artillery, and again the brave American crew surged upon the deck of the enemy: the shock was resistless; the Britons fell or were driven below; their colours were struck, they yielded to capture, and the storm of battle ceased. Both ships were wrecks; not a mast was standing on either; their rigging cut, their sails in fritters, and their hulks much damaged. Such was their shattered condition that neither could manage a single gun with celerity. The British had lost their captain, first and second lieutenants, with several other officers, and more than half their crew, most of the remainder being wounded. The second American officer was slain, and their loss in men, both killed and wounded, was nearly equal to that of the enemy. It was soon perceived that the British frigate must sink, as she had received several shots between wind and water; all hands were therefore set to work to remove the prisoners on board the American ship. While thus employed they discovered a large sail bearing down upon them, which soon came up and proved to be an English ship of the line. The victorious Americans, unable to resist, were immediately captured, and with their prisoners, so dearly vanquished, taken on board the English ship. The British frigate shortly went down, and was for ever buried beneath mountains of ponderous waves. Six glasses measured the duration of this terrible conflict. Alonzo was slightly wounded by a musket ball which grazed his left side, and with a sabre in the arm. The Briton, with the American ship in tow, soon made sail, and in a few days reached England. The wounded prisoners were sent to a hospital, but the others were confined in a strong prison within the precincts of London. The latter were huddled into an apartment with British convicts of various description. Among these Alonzo observed one whose demeanour arrested his attention. A deep melancholy was impressed upon his features; his eye was wild and despairing, his figure interesting, tall, elegant and handsome. He appeared to be about twenty-five years of age. He seldom conversed, but when he did, it was readily discovered that his education had been above the common cast, and that he possessed an enlightened and discriminating mind. Haventon sympathetically sought his acquaintance, and discovered therein a unison of woe. One evening when the prisoners were retired to rest, the stranger, upon Alonzo's request, recited the following incidents of his life: “You express,” said he, “some surprise at finding a man of my appearance in so degraded a situation, and you wish to learn the events which have plunged me into this abject state. These I will briefly relate, and your wonder will cease. “My name is Henry Malcomb; my father was a clergyman in the west of England, and descended from one of the most respectable families in those parts. I received a classical education, and then entered the military school, as I was designed for the army, to which my earliest inclinations led. Soon as my education was considered complete, an ensign's commission was procured for me in one of the regiments destined for India: previous to its departure I became acquainted with a Miss Vernon, who was a few years younger than myself, and the daughter of a gentleman farmer who had recently purchased and removed to an estate in my father's parish. Every thing that was graceful and lovely appeared centred in her person; all that was virtuous and excellent in her mind. I sought her hand: our souls soon became united in the indissoluble bonds of the sincerest love; and as there existed no parental or other impediments to our union, it was agreed that when I returned from India, where it was expected my stay would be short, the marriage solemnities should be performed. Solemn oaths of constancy passed between us, and I sailed with my regiment. “While in India I received from her and returned letters filled with the tenderest expressions of anxiety and regret of absence. At length the time came when we were to reembark for England, where we arrived after an absence of about eighteen months. The moment I reached land I hastened to the house of Mr. Vernon to visit the object I most valued on earth. She received me with all the ardency of affection, and even shed tears of joy in my presence. I pressed her to name the day which was to perfect our union and happiness, and the next Sunday, four days only distant, was agreed upon for me to VOL. II. N 2 lead her to the altar. How did my heart bound at the prospect of making Miss Vernon my own; of possessing in her all that could render life agreeable! I hastened home to my family and informed them of my approaching bliss, who all sympathized in the anticipations of felicity which swelled my bosom. “I had a sister, wild, thoughtless and gay, who was several years younger than myself; she had been the friend and confident of my mistress while I was absent; Miss Vernon passed an afternoon with her at my father's one day; when she had departed my sister requested me to attend her in a private room; we therefore retired, and she thus addressed me: “`Henry, you know that to promote your welfare, your happiness and your peace has ever been the boast and pride of my heart: nothing except this could extort the secret which I shall now disclose, and which has yet remained deposited in my own bosom; my duty to a brother whom I esteem dear as life, forbids me to remain silent. As an affectionate sister, I cannot tacitly see you thus imposed upon: I cannot see you the dupe and slave of an artful and insidious woman, who does not sincerely return your love; nor can I bear to witness your marriage with one whose soul and affections are placed upon another object.' “Here she paused, while I with insufferable anguish of mind begged her to proceed. “`About six or eight months after your departure,' she continued, `it was reported to Miss Vernon that she had a rival in India; that you had there found an American beauty on whom you lavished those endearments which belonged of right to her alone. This news made at first a deep impression on her mind, but it soon wore away, and whether from this cause, from fickleness of disposition, or that she never sincerely loved you, I know not, but this I do know, that a youth has been, for some time past, her almost constant companion.' “Again she hesitated. I laughed convulsively, and requested her to continue. “`To convince you of this,' she proceeded, `you need only tomorrow evening about sunset, conceal yourself among the laurels near the long avenue by the side of the rivulet back of Mr. Vernon's house, where you will undoubtedly surprise Miss Vernon and her companion in their usual evening excursion. If I should be mistaken I will submit to your censure; but should you find it as I have stated, you have only to rush from your concealment, charge her with her perfidy, and renounce her for ever.' “Of all the plagues, the torments, the ourses, which torture the soul, suspicion of a rival in love is the worst. Enraged, confounded, astonished, it seemed as if my bosom would have instantaneously burst. To hide my emotions I left my sister's apartment, after having thanked ner for her information and promised to obey her injunctions. I retired to my own room and there poured out my execrations. `Cursed woman!' I exclaimed, `is it thus you requite my tender love? Could a vague report of my inconstancy drive you to infidelity? Did not my continual letters breathe constant adoration? And did not yours portray the same sincerity of affection? No; it was not this that caused you to perjure your plighted vows. It was that damnable passion for novelty, which more or less holds a predominancy over your whole sex. To a new coat, a new face, a new lover, you will sacrifice honour, principle and virtue; and for these, when allied with magnificent power and splendid wealth, you will perjure your most sacred engagements, though sealed in the sanctuary of Heaven.' Thus did I rave through a sleepless night. “On the morrow, which was the day previous to our appointed marriage, I walked into the fields, and before the time my sister appointed had arrived, my feelings were wrought up almost to the frenzy of distraction. I repaired however to the spot and concealed myself in the place she had named, which was a tuft of laurels by the side of the walk. I soon perceived Miss Vernon strolling down the avenue, arm in arm with a youth elegantly dressed, and of singularly delicate appearance. They were earnestly conversing in a low tone of voice; the hand of my false mistress was gently pressed in that of the stranger. Soon as they had passed me they turned aside and seated themselves in a little arbour a few yards distant from the place where I stood. The stranger clasped Miss Vernon in his arms: `Dearest angel!' he exclaimed, `what an interruption to our bliss is the return of my hated rival!' “With fond caresses and endearing blandishments, `Fear nothing,' she replied; `I have promised and must yield him my hand, but you shall never be excluded from my heart: we shall find sufficient opportunities for private conference.' “I could restrain myself no longer—My brain was on fire. Quick as lightning I sprang from my covert, and presenting a pistol which I had concealed under my robe, `Die!' I exclaimed, `thou false and perjured wretch, by the hand thou hast dishonoured, a death too mild for so foul a crime!' and immediately shot Miss Vernon through the head, who fell dead at my feet! Then suddenly drawing my sword, `And thou, perfidious contaminator and destroyer of my bliss,' cried I, `go! attend thy companion in infamy to the black regions of everlasting torment!' So saying, I plunged my sword into his bosom! “A screech of agony, attended by the exclamation—` Henry!—your wife!—your sister!' awoke me too late to terrors unutterable —to anguish unspeakable—to woes irretrievable, and insupportable despair! It was indeed my affianced wife—It was indeed my affectionate sister, arrayed in man's habit! The one lay dead before me—the other, weltering in her blood! With a feeble and expiring voice my sister informed me that in a gay and inconsiderate moment they had concerted this plan to try my jealousy, determining to discover themselves soon as they had made the experiment. `I forgive you— Henry!' she said, `I forgive—your mistake' —and closed her eyes for ever in death! “What a scene for sensibilities like mine! to paint or describe it exceeds the power of language or imagination. I instantly turned the sword against my own bosom; an unknown hand arrested it, and prevented its entering my heart. The report of the pistol, and the dying screech of my sister, had alarmed Mr. Vernon's family, who arrived at that moment, one of whom seized my arm, and thus hindered me from destroying my own life. I submitted to be bound and conveyed to prison. My trial came on at the last assizes; I made no defence, and was condemned to death. Eight weeks from tomorrow is the day appointed for my execution. I shall cheerfully meet my fate, for who would endure life when rendered so peculiarly, so eminently miserable!” The wretched Malcomb here ended his tale of woe. No tear moistened his eye; his grief was too despairing for tears: it preyed upon his heart, drank the vital streams of life, and burst in convulsive sighs from his burning bosom. Alonzo seriously reflected on the incidents and events of this tragical story. Conscience whispered him, Are not Malcomb's miseries superior to thine? candour and correct reason must have answered YES. “Melissa perished,” said he, “but not by the hand of her lover; she expired, but not through the mistaken frenzy of him who adored her; she died, conscious of the unfeigned love I bore her.” Haventon submitted to his fate with fortitude and firmness. All places, every scene was to him equally alike. In a palace or a prison, in bed or in battle, the thorn of woe still rankled at his heart. He sought not to prolong life, but religion taught him not to destroy it. Happiness in this world he now never expected. He did not even wish for consolation or comfort, for without Melissa he could not attain or enjoy them, if spread around him, and she was low in the grave. In whatever state or station, therefore, he wore away life, was totally unimportant and immaterial. He and his fellow prisoners had been robbed when they were captured, of every thing except the clothes they wore. Their allowance of provisions was scanty and poor. They were confined in the third story of a lofty prison, without fire, and with no other bedding than a little straw. Time rolled away; no prospect appeared of their liberation, either by exchange or parole. Some of the prisoners were removed, as new ones were introduced, to other places of confinement, until not one American was left but Alonzo. VOL. II. O Meantime the day appointed for the execution of Malcomb drew near. His past and approaching fate filled the breast of Haventon with sympathetic sorrow. He saw his venerable father, his mother, his friends and acquaintance, with several pious clergymen, alternately enter the prison to console and comfort him, and to prepare him for the unchangeable state on which he was soon to enter. He perceived his mind softened by their advice and counsel; frequently would he burst into tears; often in the solitary hours of night was he heard addressing the throne of grace for mercy and forgiveness. But deep and inconsolable sorrow consumed and wasted him away; a slow but deleterious fever had consequently implanted itself in his constitution; exhausted nature could make but a weak resistance against disease and affliction like his, and about a week previous to the day appointed for his execution, he expired in peace and penitence, trusting in the mercy of his Creator through the merits of a Redeemer. Shortly after this event orders came for removing some of the prisoners to a most loathsome place of confinement, in the suburbs of the city: it fell to Alonzo's lot to be one. This incident aroused him from his lethargy and he formed a project for escaping. He had observed that the gratings in one of the windows of the apartment were loose, and could easily be removed. One night when the prisoners were asleep, he stripped off his clothes, every article of which he cut into narrow slips, twisted them into ropes, tied them together, and fastening an end thereof to one of the strongest gratings, removed the others until he had made an opening large enough to crowd himself out; he then, by the rope he had thus made, let himself down into the yard of the prison. There he found a piece of long timber, which he dragged to the wall, clambered up thereon, and sprang over into the street. His shoes and hat he left in the prison, as useless encumberances without his clothes, all of which he had converted into the means of escape, so that he was literally stark naked. He stood a moment to reflect— “Here am I,” said he, “freed from my local prison indeed, but in the midst of an enemy's country, without a friend, without the means of obtaining one day's subsistence, surrounded by the darkness of night, destitute of a single article of clothing, and even unable to form a resolution, what step next to take.— The ways of Heaven are marvellous.—May I silently bow to its dispensations!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Pursue the bright charm, and it flies, It flies ere its joys can be prest; Bliss, like the gay bow in the skies, Is gaz'd at, but never possest. Honeywood. Haventon passed along in this forlorn condition, not knowing where to proceed, or what course to adopt, but determining to cast himself upon the clemency of the first person he saw. It was about three o'clock in the morning; the street was illuminated by lamps, and he feared falling into the hands of the watch. For some time he saw no person; at length a voice from behind called out, “Hallo! messmate; what; scudding under bare poles! You must have encountered a saucy gale indeed, thus to have carried away every rag of sail!” Alonzo turned, and saw the person who spoke: he was a decent looking man, of middle age, dressed in sailors' habit. Haventon had often heard of the generosity and magnanimity of the British tars; he therefore approached him and disclosed his real situation, not even VOL. II. O 2 concealing his being taken in actual hostility against the British government, and his escape from prison. The seamen mused a few minutes; “Thy case,” said he, “is a little critical, but do not despair; had I met thee as an enemy, I should have fought thee as long as there was a shot in the locker, but as how you are now in distress, you have by the laws of war, a right to refit, though in an enemy's port. Perhaps I may be in as bad trim before the war is ended.” Then slipping off his coat and giving it to Alonzo, “I must take thee in tow,” he said, and turning, walked hastily along the street, followed by Haventon; he passed into a by-lane, entered a small house, and taking Alonzo into a back room, opened a trunk and handed out a shirt; “there,” said he, pointing to a bed, “you can turn in, and sleep till tomorrow, when we will see what can be done.” Next morning the sailor brought in a very decent suit of clothes and presented them to his guest. “You must make this place your home,” said he, “until you gain a more favourable breeze. In this great city you will be safe; for even your late gaoler would not know you in this dress; and perhaps some opportunity may offer by which you can return to your own country,” He told Alonzo that his name was Jack Brown; that he was midshipman on board the Severn; that he had a wife and four children, and owned the house in which they then were. “In order to prevent suspicion or discovery,” said he, “I shall consider you as a relation from the country until you are better provided for.” Haventon was then introduced to Brown's family; the woman was amiable, and the children lovely. Here he remained for several weeks. One day he was informed that a number of American prisoners were brought in. He went to the place where they were landed, and saw several led away to prison, and some who were diseased or disabled, carried to the hospital, which being near by, he entered it to see how the sick and wounded were treated, and found that they received as much attention as could be reasonably expected. As he passed along the different aisles, he was surprised at hearing his name called by a feeble voice; turning towards the place from whence it proceeded, he saw stretched on a mattress, a person who appeared on the point of expiring. His visage was pale and emaciated, his countenance haggard and ghastly, his eyes inexpressive and glazy. He held out his withered hand, and feebly beckoned to Haventon, who immediately approached him; his features appeared not unfamiliar, but Alonzo for a moment could not recollect him. “You do not know me,” said the apparently dying stranger. “Bowman!” exclaimed Haventon, in surprise. “Yes,” replied the sick man, “it is Bowman; you behold me on the verge of eternity—I have but a short time to continue in this world.” Alonzo inquired how he came in the power of the enemy. “By the fate of war,” he replied. “I was taken in an action near the White Plains, conducted to New-York and confined on board a prison-ship in the harbour, and thence sent with a number of others to England. I had received a wound in my thigh, from a musket ball, during the action, which mortified, and amputation was performed on the passage; since then I have been rapidly wasting away, and I now feel that the cold hand of death is upon me.” He became exhausted, and for some time remained silent. Alonzo did not before discover that he had lost a leg; he now perceived it had been taken off close to his body, and that he was worn to a skeleton. When Bowman revived, he inquired into Haventon's affairs, who related all that had happened to him after leaving New-London. “You are unhappy,” said Bowman, “in the death of your Melissa, to which it is possible I have been undesigningly an accessary. I could say much on this subject, would my strength admit; but it is needless—she is gone—and I must soon go also. She was sent to her uncle's at Charleston by her father, whither I was to follow her. It was supposed that thus widely removed from all access to your company, she would yield to the persuasion of her friends, and renounce you; her unexpected death however frustrated every design of this nature, and overwhelmed her father and family in inexpressible woe.” Here Bowman ceased. Alonzo inquired whether he was in need of any thing to render him more comfortable; he replied he was not; “For the comforts of life,” said he, “I have no relish; medical aid is applied, but without effect.” Judging he wanted rest, Haventon then left him, promising to call again in the morning. When he returned the following day, he perceived in Bowman an alarming alteration. His extremities were cold; a chilling, clammy sweat stood upon his face; his respiration was short and interrupted, his pulse weak and intermitting. He took the hand of Haventon, and feebly pressing it, “I am dying,” said he in a faint voice; “if you ever return to America, inform my friends of my fate.” This Alonzo readily engaged to do, and assured him also, that he would not leave him. Bowman soon fell into a stupour; sensation became suspended, his eyes rolled up and fixed; sometimes he experienced a partial revival, when he would fall into incoherent mutterings, calling on the names of his deceased father, his mother, and Melissa, his voice dying away in imperfect moanings till his lips continued to move without sound. Towards night he lay silent, and only continued to breathe with difficulty, till a slight convulsion gave the freed spirit to the unknown regions of immaterial existence. Haventon followed his remains to the grave; a natural stone was placed at its head, on which Alonzo carved the initials of the deceased's name, with the date of his death, and left him to moulder with his native dust. A few days after this event, Jack Brown informed Alonzo that he had procured the means of his escape. “A person of my acquaintance,” said he, “and whom I suppose to be a smuggler, has agreed to carry you to France; there, by application to the American minister, you will be enabled to get to your own country, if that is your object. About midnight I will pilot you on board, and by tomorrow's sun you may be in France.” At the time appointed Jack set out, bearing a large trunk on his shoulder, and directing Alonzo to follow him. They proceeded down to a quay, and went on board a small shallop. “Here,” said Jack to the captain, “is the gentleman I spoke to you about,” and delivered him the trunk; then taking Alonzo aside, “In that trunk,” said he, “are a few changes of linen, and here is something to help you till you can help yourself.” So saying, he slipped ten guineas into his hand. Haventon expressed his gratitude with tears. “Say nothing,” replied the generous tar; “we were born to help each other when in distress; and may Jack Brown never weather a storm, or splice a rope in the day of battle, if he permits a fellow-creature to suffer with want, while he has a luncheon on board.” He then shook Alonzo by the hand, wishing him a good voyage, and went whistling away. The shallop soon sailed, and the next morning reached Calais. Alonzo proceeded immediately to Paris, not with a view of returning to America; he had yet no relish for revisiting the land of his sorrows, the scenes where at every step his heart must bleed afresh, though to bleed it had never ceased. But he was friendless in a foreign country: perhaps through the aid of the American minister, Dr. Franklin, to whose fame Haventon was no stranger, he might be placed in a situation to procure bread, which was all he at present hoped or wished. He therefore presented himself before the Doctor, whom he found alone. To be informed that he was an American and unfortunate, was sufficient to arouse the feelings of Franklin. He desired Haventon to be seated, and to recite his history. This he readily complied with, not concealing his attachment to Melissa, her father's barbarity, her death in consequence, his own father's failure, with all the particulars of his leaving America, his capture, escape from prison and arrival in France, as also the town of his nativity, the name of his father, and the particular circumstances of his family; concluding by expressing his unconquerable reluctance to return to his native country, which now would be to him but a gloomy wilderness, and that his present object was only some means of support. VOL. II. P The Doctor inquired of Alonzo the particular circumstances and time of his father's misfortune. Of this he gave a minute account. Franklin sat in deep contemplation for the space of several minutes. He then took his pen, wrote a short note, sealed it, and gave it to Haventon: “Deliver this,” said he, “according to its direction, and you will find employment until something more favourable may offer.” Alonzo took the paper, thanked the Doctor, and went in search of the person to whom it was addressed. He soon found the house, which was situate in one of the most popular streets in Paris. He knocked at the door; it was opened by an elderly man: Alonzo inquired for the name to whom the note was directed; the gentleman said that he himself was the person. Haventon presented the note, which having read, the man invited him to walk in, and ordered supper. After it was over, he informed Alonzo that he was an English bookseller, and should employ him as a clerk, and desired to know what wages he demanded. Haventon replied he should submit that to him, being unacquainted with the customary salaries of clerks in that line of business. The gentleman observed that the matter should be arranged the ensuing day. His name was Grafton. The next morning Mr. Grafton took Alonzo into his bookstore, and gave him instructions; his business was to sell books to customers, and a list of prices was presented him for the purpose. Mr. Grafton counted out fifty crowns and gave them to Alonzo: “You may want some necessaries,” said he, “and as you have set no price on your services, we shall not differ about the wages, if you are attentive and faithful.” He gave his employer no room to complain; nor had he any reason to be discontented with his situation. Mr. Grafton regularly advanced him fifty crowns at the commencement of every month, and boarded him in his family. Haventon dressed himself in deep mourning: he sought no company; he found consolation only in solitude, if consolation it could be named. Walking out early one morning, he perceived something lying in the street, which he at first supposed to be a small piece of silk; he took it up, and found it to be a curiously wrought purse, containing a few guineas, with some small pieces of silver, and something at the bottom carefully wrapped in a piece of gilt paper; he unfolded it, and was thunderstruck at beholding an elegant miniature of Melissa! her sweetly pensive features, her expressive countenance, her soul-enlivening eye! The shock was almost too powerful for his senses. Wildered in a maze of wonders, he knew not what to conjecture. Melissa's miniature found in the streets of Paris, after she had been sometime dead! He viewed it, he clasped it to his bosom. “Such,” said he, “did she appear, ere the corroding cankers of grief had blighted her heavenly charms, or the withering hand of sorrow had impressed her celestial features! By what providential miracle am I possessed of the likeness, when the original is mouldered into dust? What benevolent angel has taken pity on my sufferings, and conveyed me this invaluable, inestimable prize?” But though he had thus obtained that which he esteemed above all earthly objects, what right had he to withhold it from the real owner, could the owner indeed be found? Perhaps the person who lost it would part with it; possibly the money contained in the purse was of more value to that person than the miniature. At any rate, justice required that he should, if possible, discover to whom it belonged; this he might do by advertising, which he immediately concluded upon, resolving, should any one appear as claimant, to purchase it if within his power. Passing into another street, he saw several handbills posted on the walls of houses; stepping up to one, he read as follows: “LOST, between the hours of 9 and 10 last evening, in the Reu de Loire, a small silk purse, containing a few pieces of money, and a Lady's Miniature. One Hundred Crowns will be given to the person who may have found it, and will return the miniature only, to the owner, at the American Hotel, near the Louvre, Room No. 4.” It was printed both in the French and English languages. By the reward here offered, Alonzo was convinced that the miniature belonged to some person who set a value upon it. Determined to explicate the mystery, he VOL. II. P 2 proceeded immediately to the place, found the room mentioned in the bill, and knocked at the door. A servant appeared, of whom he inquired for the lodger; the man answered him in French, which Haventon did not understand; he replied in his own language, but found it was unintelligible to the servant. A grave, middle-aged gentleman then came to the door from within the room, and ended their chattering; he, in the English language, desired Alonzo to walk in. It was an apartment neatly furnished; no person was therein, except the gentleman, the servant before mentioned, and a person who sat writing in a corner of the room, with his back towards them. Haventon observed that he had called according to the direction in a bill of advertisement, to inquire for the person who the preceding night had lost a purse and miniature. The gentleman who was writing had hitherto taken no notice of what passed; but at the sound of Alonzo's voice, after he had entered the room, he started and turned around, and on mention of the miniature, he rose up. Haventon fixed his eyes upon him; they both stood a few moments silent; for a short time their recollection was confused and imperfect, but the mists of doubt were soon dissipated— “Bloomfield!”—“Haventon!”—they alternately exclaimed. It was indeed Edgar, the early friend and fellow-student of Alonzo— the brother of Melissa! In an instant they were in each other's arms. They retired to a separate apartment, equally anxious for mutual explanation of so unexpected a meeting. Edgar informed Alonzo that the news of Melissa's death reached him by a letter from his father, while at the army; that he immediately procured a furlough and visited his parents, whom he found in inconsolable affliction. “The letter which my uncle had written,” said Bloomfield, “announcing the distressing event, stated with what patience and placidity she endured her malady, and with what calmness and resignation she met the approach of death. Her last moments, like her whole life, were unruffled and serene; she is in Heaven, Alonzo—she is an angel!” Swelling grief prevented his proceeding; for some time he could say no more, and Haventon, with a bursting heart could only mingle his tears. “My father,” resumed Bloomfield, at length, “bent on uniting her to Bowman, or at least on preventing her union with you, had removed her to a desolate family mansion, and placed her under the care of an aunt. At that place he either suspected or really discovered that you had access to her while her guardian was absent on business. She was therefore no longer intrusted to the care of her aunt, but my father immediately formed and executed the plan of sending her to his brother in South Carolina, with the pretence of restoring her health, by change of climate, which in reality had begun seriously to decline: there it was designed that Bowman should shortly follow her, with recommendations from my father to our uncle, urging him to use all possible means which might tend to persuade her to relinquish all thoughts of you, and accept the hand of your rival. But change of climate only increased her load of sorrows, and she soon perished beneath them. The letter mentioned nothing of her mental afflictions; possibly my uncle's family were not acquainted therewith; to them, probably, she never disclosed the secrets of her bosom, but a prey to bitter grief and melancholy concealment, sank silently into the tomb. My father's distress was excessive; often did he accuse himself of barbarity; and he once earnestly expressed a wish that he had consented to her union with you. Notwithstanding he is parsimonious, yet he sincerely loved his children. Inflexible as is his nature, the untimely death of a truly affectionate and an only daughter, will, I much fear, precipitate him, and perhaps my mother also, to a speedy grave. “Soon as my feelings would permit, I repaired to the residence of your parents, and made inquiry concerning you. I found them easy in their reduced circumstances, except that your father had been ill, but was recovering. Of you they had heard nothing after your departure, and they deeply lamented your absence. From Vincent I could obtain no farther information. “Sick of the world, I returned to the army. An American ambassador was soon to sail for Holland; I solicited and obtained the appointment of secretary, hoping, by visiting distant countries, in some measure to relieve my mind from the deep melancholy with which it was oppressed. We were to proceed first to Paris, where we have been a few days: tomorrow we depart for Holland. The minister is the gentleman who introduced you into the room where you found me. Last evening I lost the miniature which I suppose you have found; the chain to which it was suspended around my neck, had broken while I was walking in the street; I carefully wrapped it in paper and deposited it in my purse, which I probably dropped on replacing in my pocket, and did not discover the loss until this morning; I immediately made diligent search, but not finding it, I put up bills of advertisement. The likeness was taken in my sister's happiest days: after I had entered upon my clerical studies in New-York, I became acquainted with a miniature-painter, who took mine; he afterwards went into the country, and as I found he was to pass near Bloomfield Vale, I engaged him to call there and take my sister's also; we exchanged them soon after; it was dear to me even while the original remained, but since she is gone it has become a most invaluable relique.” All the affectionate powers of Alonzo's soul were called into action by Edgar's recital. The “days of other years”—the ghost of sepulchred blessings, passed in painful review. Added to these, the indigent circumstances of his parents, his father's recent illness, and his probable inability to procure even the common necessaries of life, all tended more deeply to sink his spirits in the gulf of melancholy and misery. He however informed Edgar of all that had happened since they parted at Vincent's; respecting the old mansion, Melissa's extraordinary disappearance therefrom, the manner in which he was informed of her death, his departure from America, capture, Bowman's death, his own escape from prison, arrival in France, and finding the miniature. To both Edgar and Alonzo the manner of Melissa's sudden removal from the mansion was still inexplicable, though convinced that it was effected by her aunt or her father. As Bloomfield was to depart early the next morning, they neither slept nor separated that night. “If it were not for your reluctance to revisit your native country,” said Edgar, “I should urge you to accompany me to Holland, and thence return with me to America. Necessity and duty require that I should not be long absent, as my parents want my assistance, and they are now childless.” “Suffer me,” answered Haventon, “to bury myself in this city for the present; should I ever again awake to real life, I will seek you out if you are on earth, but now I can only be a companion to my miseries.” The next morning as they were about to part, Alonzo took Melissa's miniature from his bosom; he contemplated the picture a few moments with ardent emotion, and presented it to Edgar. “Keep it,” said Bloomfield, “it is thine. I bestow it upon thee as I would the original, had not death have become the rival of thy love and of my affection. Permit not the sacred symbol too tenderly to renew your sorrows. How swiftly, Haventon, does this restless life fleet away! How soon shall we pass the barriers of terrestrial existence! Let us live worthy of ourselves, of our holy religion, of Melissa—Melissa, whom, when a few more suns have arisen and set, we shall meet in regions where all tears shall be eternally wiped from every eye.” With what unspeakable sensibilities was it returned to the bosom from whence it was taken! Edgar offered Alonzo pecuniary assistance, which the latter refused: “I am in business,” said he, “which brings me a decent support, and that is sufficient.” They agreed to write each other as opportunities presented, and then affectionately parted; Edgar sailed for Holland, and Alonzo returned to his employment at Mr. Grafton's. Sometime after this Haventon received a message from Dr. Franklin, requesting him to call at his house; he instantly obeyed the summons; the Doctor introduced him into his study, and after being seated, Franklin earnestly surveyed him for some time, and then addressed him as follows: “Young man, your views, your resolutions, and the present course of your conduct, are totally wrong. Disappointment, you say, has driven you from your native country. Disappointment in what? In obtaining the object you most valued. But suppose you had experienced a completion of your wishes and expectations; would you then have been happy? Your own reason, if you coolly consult it, will convince you to the contrary. Do you not remember, when an infant, how you VOL. II. Q cried and teazed your nurse or your parents for a rattle, or some gay trinket? Your whole soul was fixed upon the enchanting gewgaw; but when possessed you soon cast it away; and sighed as ardently for some other trifle, some new toy. Thus it is through life; the fancied value of an object ceases with the attainment; it becomes familiar, and its charm is lost. Was it the splendours of beauty which enraptured you? Sickness may, and age must, destroy the symmetry of the most finished form, the brilliancy of the finest features. Was it the graces of intellect? I tell you that by familiarity these allurements perish, and the mind left vacant turns to some other source to supply the vacuum. Stripped of all but their intrinsic value, how poor, how vain, how worthless, are those things we name pleasures and enjoyments! “Besides, the attainment of your wishes might have been the death of your hopes. If my reasoning be correct, the ardency of your passion must have expired with the pursuit— an every-day dress, however rich and costly the texture, is soon soiled—on your part, indifference would consequently have succeeded; on that of your partner, disappointment, jealousy and disgust. What might have followed is needless for me to name; your soul must shudder at the idea of conjugal discord and connubial hostility! “But granting the most favourable consequences; turn the brightest side of the picture; admitting as much happiness as the marriage state will allow; how might your bosom have been wounded by the sickness and death of your children, or their disorderly and disobedient conduct! You must know, also, that the warmth of youthful passion soon ceases, and it is merely a hazardous chance whether friendship will supply the absence of affection. After all, my young friend, it will be well for you to consider, whether the all-wise, dispensing hand of Providence has not directed this matter, which you esteem so heavy an affliction, for your greatest good and most essential advantage. And permit me to tell you, that in all my observations on life, I have always found that those connexions which were formed from inordinate passion, or what you would call pure affection, have been ever the most unhappy. Examine the varied circles of society, you will there see this axiom demonstrated; you will there perceive how few among the sentimentally refined are even apparently at ease, while those insusceptible of what you term tender attachments, or who receive them only as things of course, plod on through life without ever experiencing the least inconvenience from a want of the pleasures they are supposed to bestow, or the existence of pains they are sure to create. Beware then, my son, beware of yielding the heart to the effeminacies of passion. Exquisite sensibilities are ever subject to exquisite inquietudes. Counsel with correct reason; submit to the dispensations of Heaven; place entire dependence on the Supreme, and the triumph of fortitude and resignation will be yours.” Franklin paused. His reasonings, howver they convinced the understanding, healed not the wounds of Alonzo's bosom. In Melissa he looked for as much happiness as earth could afford, and he perceived no consoling hand in life able to repair the loss he had sustained. “You have,” resumed the philosopher, “deserted an indulgent father, a fond and tender mother, who must want your aid; now perhaps unable to toil for bread; now possibly laid upon the bed of sickness, calling in anguish or delirium for the filial hand of their only child to administer relief. [All the parental affections of Alonzo were now called into poignant action.] You have left a country bleeding at every vein; desolated by the ravages of war; wrecked by the thunders of battle; her heroes slain; her children captured, her towns conflagrated. This country asks, she demands, you owe her your services. God and nature call upon you to defend her, while here you bury yourself in inglorious inactivity, pining for a hopeless object, which by all your lamentations you can never repossess, or bring back to the regions of mortality.” This aroused the patriotic flame in the bosom of Alonzo, and he involuntarily exclaimed, “I will go to the relief of my parents—I will fly to the defence of my country!” “In former days,” continued Franklin, “I was well acquainted with your father. Soon as you informed me of his failure I wrote to my correspondent in London, and found, as I suspected, that he had been overreached by swindlers and sharpers. The pretended insolvency VOL. II. Q 2 of the merchants with whom he was connected proves to be all a deception, as does also the reported loss of the ships in their employ. The merchants fled to England; I have had them arrested, and they have given up their effects, to much more than the amount of their debts. I have therefore procured a restoration of your father's property, which, with costs, damages and interests, when legally stated, he will receive of my agent in Philadelphia, to whom I shall transmit sufficient documents by you, and shall advance you a sum equal to the expences of your voyage, which will be liquidated by the said agent. A ship sails in a few days from Havre for Savannah in Georgia; I will give you a draft on a house in that city, upon which you will receive cash when you arrive, to enable you to prosecute your journey. It would indeed be more convenient were the vessel bound to some northern port, but I know of no other which will sail for any part of America in some time. On board her therefore I would advise you to take passage; it is not very material in what quarter of the continent you are landed, you will soon reach Philadelphia, transact your business, restore your father to his possessions, and be ready to serve your country.” If any thing could yield Alonzo consolation, it must have been this noble, liberal and disinterested conduct of the great Franklin, by which his family were to be placed in ease and independence. Ah! could this fortunate event have occurred in time to save a life far dearer than his own!—the reflection was too painful, too excrutiating for retention. The idea, however, of affording joy and comfort to his aged parents hastened his departure. Furnished with proper documents and credentials from his generous benefactor, he took leave of him with the warmest expressions of gratitude, bade adieu to the family of Mr. Grafton, repaired to Havre, and sailed for Savannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. And where, thou blest immortal, art thou flown! Can these deep shades detain thy willing ear! Canst thou from loaded breezes hear a groan, Or stain thy spotless mantle with a tear! Barlow. The ship in which Alonzo embarked was a merchantman letter of marque, commanded and manned by Frenchmen, with American papers, and sailing under the flag of the United States. She carried sixteen guns, and had a number of passengers on board, of both sexes, among whom were some entire families, whose design was to settle in Louisiana; but besides Haventon there were only three Americans; Mr. Freeland, concerned in the cargo of the vessel which consisted of French dry goods, and his two clerks. Freeland was a bachelor of about forty years of age, a native of Savannah, where for several years he had been a considerable trader; he was a person of some information, and the only one on board with whom Alonzo formed any intimacy, as the clerks were but mere youth, neither of them being over sixteen years old. Fine weather and pleasant breezes attended them across the Atlantic. As they were armed only for defence, and as British cruizers were scouring the ocean, they endeavoured to shun all large vessels which appeared like ships of war. Deeper melancholy impressed the mind of Haventon as he approached the American shore. He was returning indeed to his native land, but to him it was a country widowed of every joy; a land where his sad bereavement would be renewed by every familiar object. One consolation was left him; he came empowered to restore his parents to affluence; when he had effected this he determined to fly to the standard of his country, and to exert himself in the cause of freedom while his life or the war should continue. The morning they came within soundings a large sail appeared coming off the coast; she bore down upon them, and soon was discovered to be a frigate under English colours; instantly they set all the canvas their ship could carry, and put her before the wind, which happened to be favourable. The frigate gave them chase through the day; towards evening she came so near as to commence a running fire, but with little effect. Night set in with dark and heavy clouds, and the wind springing up, they altered their course and escaped. A storm came on, which towards midnight increased to a severe gale. Knowing that they must be near the coast, and apprehensive of danger, as the wind blew in shore, they attempted to lie to, but this the violence of the gale prevented. They found by casting the lead that they were rapidly approaching shoal water; they let go all their anchors, and lightened the ship by throwing over her guns; the anchors held her but for a few moments; the cables parted, and they drove with amazing velocity towards land. Consternation then seized the crew; they saw nothing but inevitable destruction before them. Suddenly she struck upon a reef with tremendous crash. All was alarm and confusion. The darkness of the night, the raging of the wind, the roaring of the sea, mingled with the despairing cries of men, women and children, formed a scene beyond description terrible. The masts were all carried away. As a last resort they hoisted out the long boat, which was immediately stove to pieces against the sides of the vessel; the only remaining boat was let down with more caution; the people inconsiderately rushed in, and in a moment were buried with it beneath the waves. Instantly a general and an agonizing screech announced the parting of the ship, and human voices ceased to wail. Haventon with the rest sank in the deep, but in struggling with the billows caught hold of a broken spar. His mind was collected. He saw himself upon the verge of eternity, just entering the world of spirits. “Pardon, Great God!” he exclaimed, “all the failings, all the errors of thy creature, and receive him to thy mercy. My parents! could I have first restored them—but thy Almighty will be done. I shall now meet my Melissa.” He was hurried swiftly along, sometimes floating on liquid mountains, then buried in their suffocating bosoms, till on the receding of a stupendous billow he found himself resting on land. He attempted to rise, but was unable; he therefore crawled as far as his strength would permit; and the rage of the returning wave expired at his feet, by which he judged he was now beyond the fury of the sea: by seizing hold of small shrubbery, he drew himself up a little eminence, and soon by exertion recovered the use of his limbs. He fell upon his knees and returned thanks to that Power, in whose hands are the destinies of life, and who had preserved him through so dreadful a catastrophe. Day began to break; the violence of the storm had abated, but the sea was still in terrible commotion. Alonzo walked along the shore, where at every step the scattered fragments of the ship were mingled with the dead bodies of his late companions. He contemplated the awful scene with feelings of the most poignant distress. Suddenly he was startled by a low, hollow groan: searching among the dead whence it proceeded, he discovered a body in which appeared some symptoms of life, but so disfigured with sand and sea-weed that at first he could not clearly distinguish the features: on a closer examination he, with mingled emotions of pleasure and surprise, perceived it to be Freeland. He drew the body out from among the filth and rubbish with which it was partially covered, placed it on a bank, and by constant and continued friction restored animation; but it was long before correct sensation returned; intermitting sighs at length succeeded a convulsive struggle, and Freeland opened his eyes, at first gazing vacantly around him, then fixing them on Haventon; slowly recollection came to his mind; he raised himself up, and the destructive effects of the shipwreck met his sight. “All have perished then,” he exclaimed, “except ourselves, and by what miracle are we preserved?” “By a miracle indeed,” replied Haventon, and related the manner in which he had escaped death. Freeland informed Alonzo that when the ship parted he was standing on the quarter-deck; that he clung to the rudder, which buoyed him up until he was dashed with great violence against a rock on the shore, when he lost all sensation. VOL. II. R It was with much difficulty, and not without the assistance of Haventon, that Freeland could walk; they however slowly traversed the shore, searching among the bodies to see if there were yet any which retained the least signs of remaining life; but all were cold and inanimate; all had apparently been long dead. On casting his eyes around, Freeland exclaimed, “I know this place well; we are on one of the small islands bordering the coast of Georgia; I have often been here: about half a mile inland there is a cluster of houses, where we can obtain refreshment and assistance.” Feeble and exhausted, they set out for the place and arrived there about noon. The inhabitants, to whom Freeland was known, received them with hospitality, and granted them every aid in their power. The people assembled and repaired to the coast, where they buried the dead, and collected such valuable fragments of the wreck as had been cast on shore. The next day Haventon and Freeland were conveyed to the continent, and they soon reached Savannah. Freeland invited Alonzo to his house; it was managed by servants, and an elderly man and woman whom he called his overseers. “You will make this place your home,” said he to Haventon, “so long as it may suit your convenience. I hope it will be unnecessary to request you to use the same freedom as though it was your own.” The latter thanked him, but said that important business demanded his immediate departure for the northern states. “You will not, then,” said the other, “feel a delicacy in making use of my purse, which, whatever may be your future prospects, your present circumstances, occasioned by the late disastrous events, must render indispensible.” “I would with gratitude and pleasure accept your generous offer,” replied Haventon, “but I have preserved my papers, among which is a draft upon a mercantile house in this city which will completely answer all my purposes.” The documents and credentials which Alonzo received from Franklin he had carefully wrapped in a piece of oiled seal-skin and deposited them in his trunk; when the ship struck, he flew to the trunk, took them out and placed them in his bosom. “If my life is prolonged, or if not, and my body should be found,” thought he, “they may yet reach my father.” The oiled skin resisted the water, and they were thus preserved. Intent on his purpose, he immediately turned the draft into cash, purchased a carriage, took a grateful leave of Freeland, and proceeded on for Philadelphia. As he approached Charleston, his bosom swelled with mournful recollection. Near this place, the riches of his earliest fond hopes, the only earthly blessing he had ever seriously aspired to attain, lay buried. Here were entombed all the joys, every comfort his affections could comprise: though hereafter he might find momentary consolation, he never could experience pleasure or delight, for here had perished his felicity, here mouldered Melissa! He reached the city in the afternoon, and entered an inn of decent appearance, where he proposed staying until the next day. He asked the landlord some questions respecting the family of Bloomfield; the innkeeper could give no information on the subject, as he was but little acquainted in the city, having recently removed thither from the country. At evening Alonzo walked out and wandered about the city and its environs. He felt exceedingly anxious to learn something more particular respecting Melissa's death; but to whom could he apply? He might easily inquire out her uncle; yet what purpose would this answer, as to approach him comported not with Haventon's ideas of propriety. Her uncle had doubtless been made acquainted with all the particulars of her history, and had probably acted in concert with her father. From him therefore Alonzo had nothing to expect, perhaps not even the common courtesies due to strangers; but he experienced an extreme reluctance to leave Charleston without obtaining some information relative to the last moments of Melissa. “Ah!” he silently ejaculated, “could I but find the place where her remains are deposited, that I might consecrate it with tears!” In his excursion he passed near the large burial ground; involuntarily he paused: “Possibly,” he sighed, “the object of my early solicitudes VOL. II. R 2 and lasting lamentations rests here in this solemn habitation of gloom and silence.” He entered a little ale-house which stood near. An elderly woman and two small children were all the persons he found in the hut. After calling for a pint of ale he asked the old lady if a gentleman by the name of Bloomfield did not reside in the city: she informed him that a person of that name now lived at Bloomfield Hill, about two miles from town, where he had an elegant country seat; that he was very rich, and owned a superb house in the city, which he occupied during the winter. “Was there not a young lady,” asked Alonzo, “who died in the family about twenty months ago?” “Dear me!” said she, “Did you know her then? Yes; there was; and a sweeter or more handsomer lady the sun never shined on. And then she was so good, so patient in her sickness. Poor, dear, distressed girl, she pined away to skin and bone before she died. She was not Col. Bloomfield's daughter, only somehow related; she was sickly, and came here in hopes that a change of air might do her good. She came from — Good lack! I can't think of the name of the place; it is a crabbed name, though.” “Connecticut, was it not?” said Haventon. “Oh yes; that was it,” replied she. “Dear suz! Then you knew her, did you, Sir? Well; we hav'n't her like left in Charleston, that we ha'n't. And then there was such ado at her funeral; five hundred people, I dare say, and more too, with eight young ladies for pall-bearers, all dressed in white, with black ribbons, and all the bells tolling so.” “Where was she buried?” inquired Alonzo. “In the great church-yard right before our door,” she answered; “my husband is the sexton; he put up her large, white marble tomb-stones; they are the largest and whitest and grandest in the whole burying-ground, and so indeed they ought to be, for never was there a person who deserved them more.” Tired of the old woman's loquacity, and with a bosom bursting in anguish, he paid for his ale without drinking it, bade her good night, and slowly proceeded to the church-yard. The moon in meridian glory shone with solemn, silvery ray, on the consecrated piles and funereal monuments of the sacred dead; the wind murmured mournfully among the weeping-willows; a solitary nightingale[6] [6] This bird, though not an inhabitant of the northern states, is frequently to be met with in Georgia and the Carolinas. sang plaintively in the distant forest, and a whipperwill, Melissa's favourite bird, whistled near the portico of the church. The large, white tomb-stones soon caught the eye of Haventon; he approached them with tremulous step, and with feelings too agitated for description. On the head-stone he read as follows: SACRED To the memory of inestimable, departed Worth; To unrivalled excellence and virtue, MISS MELISSA BLOOMFIELD: Whose remains are deposited here; And whose ethereal part became a Seraph, October 26, 1776, In the 19th year of her age. Alonzo bent, he kneeled, he prostrated himself, he clasped the green turf which inclosed her grave, he watered it with his tears, he warmed it with his sighs. “Where art thou, bright beam of heavenly light?” he said. “Come to my troubled soul, blest spirit! come, holy shade! come in all thy native loveliness, and cheer the bosom of wretchedness by thy grief-dispersing smile! On the ray of you evening star descend—one moment leave the celestial regions of glory— leave one moment thy sister beatitudes—glide in intrancing beauty before me—wave, benignly wave thy white hand, and assuage the anguish of despairing sorrow! Alas! in vain my invocations! A curtain impenetrable is drawn between me and thee, only to be dissolved with the dissolution of nature!” He arose and walked away with hurried step: suddenly he stopped: “Yet,” said he, “if spirits departed lose not the power of recollection; if they have knowledge of passing events on earth, Melissa cannot have forgotten me—she must pity me.” He returned to the grave, he took her miniature from his bosom, he held it up, and earnestly viewed it by the moon's pale ray. “Ah, Franklin!” he exclaimed, “where is thy philosophy now! How tenderly pensive beam her lovely eyes upon me! How often have I drank delicious ecstacy from the delicacy of those celestial charms! How frequently have they taught me to anticipate superlative and uninterrupted bliss! Mistaken and delusive hope! [returning the miniature to his bosom:] Vain and presumptuous assurance! There, [pointing to the grave,] there, behold how my dearest wishes—my proudest hopes—my fondest expectations are realized!” He stood awhile silent in speechless agony; then with interrupting sighs he softly murmured, “Hallowed turf! lie lightly on her bosom! Sacred willows! sprinkle the dews gently over her tomb, while the moaning breezes sigh sadly amidst your branches! Here let the `widowed wild-rose' love to bloom, and the sweet-briar to languish! here may the first placid beams of morning delight to linger; from hence the mild rays of evening reluctantly retire! and when the final trump shall renovate and arouse the sleeping saint; when on `buoyant step' she soars to glory, may our meeting spirits join in beatific transport, and my enraptured ear catch the first holy whisper of her consecrated lips!” Having thus poured out the effusions of an overcharged heart, he pensively returned to the inn, and seated himself in the common room, in deep contemplation. As usual at public houses, a number of people were gathered there, among whom were several officers of the American army. Haventon was too deeply involved in melancholy reflection, to notice passing incidents, until a young officer took a seat near him, and entered into conversation respecting the events of the war. His person was interesting, his address sprightly, his observations correct. Alonzo was in some degree aroused from his abstraction; the manners of the stranger pleased him. His frankness, his ease, his understanding, his urbanity, void of arrogance or pedantry, spontaneously attracted the respect and esteem of Haventon, and he even felt a sort of solemn regret when the stranger departed. He soon retired to bed, determining to proceed on early in the morning. He arose about daylight; the horizon was overcast; it soon began to rain, and before sunrise a heavy storm set in. He found therefore that he must content himself to stay until it was over, which did not happen till near night, and too late to pursue his journey. He was informed by the innkeeper, that the theatre, which had been closed since the commencement of the war, was to be opened for that night only, with the tragedy of Gustavus, and close with a representation of Burgoyne's capture, and some other recent events of the American war. To `wing the minutes with swifter speed,' he determined to go to the theatre, and at the hour appointed repaired thither. As he was advancing along the aisle he passed a box where sat the young officer, whose manners had so prepossessed him the preceding evening, at the inn; they recognized each other, exchanged salutations, and Alonzo walked on and took his seat. The evening was warm, and the house exceedingly crowded. When the tragedy was concluded, and before the after-piece commenced, the officer came to Haventon's box, and made some remarks on the merits of the actors. While they were discoursing, a bustle took place in one part of the house, and several people gathered around a box, a little distance from them. The stranger turned, left Alonzo, and hastened to the place. To the general inquiry of “what's the matter,” it was answered that “a lady had fainted.” She was led out, and the tumult subsided. Soon as the representation closed, Haventon returned to the inn. As he passed along he cast his eyes towards the church-yard, where lay the `withered blessings of his dearest joys.' Affection, passion, inclination, urged him to go and breathe a farewell sigh, to drop a final tear over the tomb of Melissa; discretion, reason, wisdom, forbade it—forbade that he should repierce the ten thousand wounds of his bosom, by the acute revival of unavailing sorrows.—He hurried to his chamber. As he prepared to retire to rest, he saw a book lying on the table near his bed. On taking it up, he found it to be Young's Night Thoughts; a volume which in happier days had been the solace of many a gloomy, many a lucid hour. He opened it, and the first lines he cast his eyes upon were the following: VOL. II. S “Song, beauty, youth, love, virtue, joy! this group Of bright ideas—flowers of Paradise, As yet unforfeit! in one blaze we bind, Kneel, and present it to the skies; as all We guess of Heaven! And these were all her own, And she was mine, and I was—was most blest— Like blossom'd trees o'erturn'd by vernal storm, Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay— Ye that e'er lost an angel, pity me!” His tears fell fast upon the page; he replaced the book, and flung himself into bed. Sleep was far from him; he closed not his eyes till dawning light broke from the east; he then fell into interrupted slumbers. When he awoke, the morning was considerably advanced. He arose. One consolation was yet left—to see his parents happy. He went down to order his carriage: his favourite stranger, the young officer, was in waiting, and requested a private interview. They immediately retired to a separate room, and the stranger thus addressed him. “From our short acquaintance, Sir, you may consider it singular that I should attempt to scrutinize your private concerns; more extraordinary may you esteem it, when I inform you of my reasons for so doing. Judging however from appearances, I have no doubt of your candour; if my questions should be deemed improper, you will have the goodness to tell me so.” Alonzo assured him he would treat him candidly. “This I believe,” said the officer; “I therefore take the liberty to ask if you are an American.” “I am,” answered Haventon. “I presume,” added the stranger—“the question is a delicate one—I presume—your family is respectable?” “Sacredly so, Sir,” replied Alonzo. “Are you unmarried, Sir?” “I am now, and have ever been single.” “Have you any prospects of connecting in marriage?” “I have not, Sir.” “I may then safely proceed,” continued the officer: “I trust you will hear me attentively, judge maturely, and decide discreetly. At any rate, I am confident you will answer me sincerely. “A young lady of this city, with whom I am well acquainted, and on terms of the most intimate friendship; whose father is affluent, and her connexions eminently respectable; whose manners are engaging, whose mind is virtue, whose elegance of form, and personal beauty, defy competition, is the cause, sir, of this mission. Early introduced into the higher walks of life, she has passed the rounds of fashionable company: many suitors have sighed for her hand, whom she complaisantly dismissed, without disobliging, as her heart had not yet been touched by the tender passion of love. Surprising as it may however seem, it is now about six months since she saw in a dream, the youth who possessed the power to inspire her with this passion. In her dream she saw a young gentleman whose manners and appearance interested her so deeply as to render her unhappy. She thought he endeavoured to obtain an interview with her, but that some invisible power prevented it. It seemed that if they could but converse together, it would ensure their felicity. At length he approached, and just as he was about to address her, she awoke. “This extraordinary vision she has communicated to several of her acquaintance. Confident that she should at some future time meet with the real person whose semblance she had thus seen, her mind has never since been perfectly at ease. Her father, who has but one child besides herself, being extremely fond of her, has promised that if ever this unknown stranger should appear to claim her hand, he will not oppose their union, provided he is respectable, and that if worthy of her choice, he will make him independent. On my return from the inn the evening I first saw you, I told my cousin—I beg pardon, Sir—I was wandering from my subject—After I first met you at the inn, I fell in company with the lady, and in a rallying way, told her I had seen her invisible beau, as we used to style the visionary gentleman. I superficially described your person, and descanted a little on the embellishments of your mind. She listened with some curiosity and attention; but I had so often jested with her in VOL. II. S 2 this manner, that she thought but little of it. At the play last night, I had just been conversing with her when I came to your box; her eyes followed me, but no sooner had they rested on you, than she fainted! This was the cause of my leaving you so abruptly, and not returning. According to her request, we conveyed her immediately home, when she informed me that you was the person she had seen in her dream! To me only, as her most trusty friend, she disclosed the circumstance. Even her father and mother are not informed of it, and should my mission prove unsuccessful, I shall rest satisfied that our confidence has been honourably reposed, and is most securely deposited. “Now, Sir, is it necessary for me farther to explain? Singular as the facts which I have related may be considered by you, to me they must appear as strange. One valuable purpose is however answered thereby; it will exclude the imputation of capriciousness —the freakish whim of love at first sight, which exists only in novels and romances. You, sir, are young, unmarried, unaffianced, your affections free. Such are the circumstances of the lady. She inquires not into the state of your property: she asks not riches. If she obtain the object of her choice, on him, as I have told you, will her father bestow affluence. Whatever, Sir, may be your pretensions to eminence, and they may be many, the lady is not your inferior. Her education also is such as would do honour to a gentleman of taste. I will not extend my remarks: you perfectly understand me—What answer shall I return?” Alonzo sighed: for a few moments he was silent. So sudden, so unexpected was this singular and extraordinary proposition, that though not indecisive as to an answer, he scarcely knew how to frame his reply. “Perhaps,” said the stranger, “you may view the manner of this message as bearing the appearance of indecorum. If so, I presume that on reviewing the incidents which led to—which induced it, as the most safe—as indeed the only proper means of communication, you will change your opinion. Probably you would not wish finally to decide until you have visited the lady. This was my expectation, and I am therefore ready to introduce you to her presence.” “No, Sir,” replied Haventon, “so far from considering the message indecorous, I esteem and receive it as a mark of peculiar distinction both as it respects the lady and yourself; nor is it necessary that I should visit her to confirm the truth of what you have related. You will not, Sir, receive it as a compliment when I say that although our acquaintance has been short, yet my confidence in your honour and integrity is such as to require no corroborating facts to establish your declaration. But, Sir, there are obstacles, insuperable obstacles to the execution of the measures you would propose. Your frankness to me demands on my part equal sincerity. I assured you that I was unmarried, and had no prospect of entering into matrimonial alliances; this is indeed the fact; but it is also true that my affections —my first, my earliest affections were engaged, inalienably engaged, to an object which is now no more. Perhaps you may esteem it singular; possibly you will consider it enthusiasm; but, Sir, it is impossible that my heart should admit a second and similar impression.” The stranger paused—“Recent disappointments of this nature,” he replied, “commonly leave the mind under such gloomy influences; time, however, the soother of severest woes, will, though slowly, yet surely, disperse those clouds of anguish, and the rays of consolation and tranquility again beam upon the soul. I wish not to be considered importunate, but the day may arrive when you will change your present determination, and then must you not regret that you rejected so advantageous an overture?” “That day can never arrive, Sir,” answered Alonzo. “I have had time for deliberate reflection since the melancholy event occurred; I have experienced a sufficient change of objects and of country; the effect is the same, the wound is still recent, and so it will ever remain: indeed I cannot wish it otherwise: there is a rich and sacred solemnity in my sorrows, Sir, which I would not exchange for the most splendid acquirements of wealth, the most dignified titles of fame, or the most alluring blandishments of pleasure.” The young officer sat for some minutes silent. “Well, Sir,” he said; “since it is thus; seeing that these things are so; I will urge you no farther. You will pardon me respecting the part I have taken in this business, as it was certainly with the purest motives. May comfort and happiness be yet restored to your bosom.” “To you and your fair friend,” returned Haventon, “I consider myself under the highest obligations. The gratitude I feel can be but feebly expressed. Believe me, Sir, when I tell you, and it is all I can do, that though I am fit only to associate with my afflictions, yet your ingenuous conduct has left impressions in my breast which can never be obliterated till the current of life ceases to flow.” The stranger held out his hand, which Alonzo ardently pressed; they were silent, but their eyes spoke sympathy, and they parted. Haventon immediately prepared, and was soon ready to depart. As he was stepping into his carriage he saw the officer returning; when he came up, “I must intrude a few moments longer,” he said, “and will then give you no farther trouble. You will recollect that the lady about whom I have so much teazed you, when she became acquainted with you in her dream believed that if she could but speak to you, joy and felicity would ensue. Confident that this indication may comprise some mystery, for with all her accomplishments she is a little superstitious, she requests a short interview. You have nothing to fear, Sir; she would not for the wealth of worlds yield you her hand, unless in return you could give her your heart. Nor was I to inform you that she made this request, but to introduce you as by my own invitation. Conscious however that you would thus far humour the caprice of a lady, I chose to tell you the truth. She resides near by, and it will not detain you long.” “It is capriciousness in the extreme,” thought Alonzo; but he assured the stranger he would accompany him, who immediately took a seat in the carriage, and they drove by his direction to an elegant building in a street at a little distance, and alighted. As they entered the house, a servant handed the stranger a note, which he hastily looked over; “Tell the gentleman I will be with him in a moment,” said he to the man, who instantly withdrew. Turning to Haventon, “A person is in waiting,” he said, “on urgent business; excuse me therefore if it is with reluctance I retire a few moments after having announced you. I will soon be with you again.” They then ascended a flight of stairs, and after winding through two or three rooms, the officer opened the door of a chamber—“The gentleman I mentioned to you, Madam,” he said. Alonzo entered; the officer closed the door and retired. The lady was sitting by a window at the opposite side of the room, but arose as Haventon was announced. She was dressed in sky-blue silk, embroidered with spangled lace; a gemmed tiara gathered her hair, from which was suspended a green veil; a purple silk girdle with diamond clasps surrounded her waist, and a brilliant sparkled upon her bosom. “The stranger's description was not exaggerated,” thought Alonzo, “for except ONE, I have never seen a more elegant figure,” and he almost wished the veil removed, that he might behold her features. “You will please to be seated, Sir,” she said. “I know not how—I feel an inexpressible diffidence in making an excuse for the inconveniences my silly caprices have given you.” Enchanting melody was in her voice!—Alonzo knew not why, but it thrilled his bosom, electrified his soul, and vibrated every nerve of his heart! Confused and hurried sensations, melancholy, yet pleasing, transporting as the recurrence of youthful joys, enrapturing as dreams of early childhood, passed in rapid succession over his recollection. She advanced towards him and turned aside her veil. Her eyes were suffused; tears streamed down her cheeks. Alonzo started—his whole frame shook—he gasped for breath —“Melissa!”—he convulsively exclaimed— “God of infinite wonders!—It is Melissa!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. I CHAPTER XVI. Thus, over the storm, and in glory on high, The peaceable rainbow encircles the sky, Looks abroad on the world, while the thunder retires, The tempest subsides and the whirlwind expires; In beauty sublime all creation is drest, And the music of summer lulls nature to rest. Darby. Again will the incidents of our history produce a pause. Our sentimental readers will experience a recurrence of sympathetic sensibilities, and attend more eagerly to the final scene of our drama. “Melissa alive?” may they say; “Impossible! Did not Alonzo see her death announced in the public prints? Did not her cousin at New-London inform him of the circumstance, and was he not in mourning? Did not the dying Bowman confirm the melancholy event? And was not the unquestionable testimony of her brother Edgar sufficient to establish the fact? Did not the sexton's wife, who knew not Haventon, corroborate it? And did not Alonzo himself finally read her name, her age, and the time of her death, on her tomb-stone, which exactly accorded with the publication in the papers, and his own knowledge of her age? And is not all this competent to prove, clearly and incontestibly prove, that she is dead! And yet, here she is again, in all her primitive beauty and splendour! No; this surely can never be. However the author may succeed in description; in painting inanimate nature, he is no magician; or if he is, he cannot raise the dead. Melissa has long since mouldered into dust, and he has conjured up some female Martin Guerre, or Thomas Hoag[7] [7] These were men who in countenance, stature, voice and manners, so nearly resembled some other persons that their own wives could not discriminate between them. One of these instances, that of Hoag, occurred in the city of New-York; the other in England. —some person from whose near resemblance to the deceased he thinks to impose upon us, and upon Haventon also, for Melissa. But it will not do; it must be the identical Melissa herself, or it might as well be her likeness in a marble statue. What! Can Alonzo realize the delicacies, the tenderness, the blandishments, of Melissa in another? Can her substitute point him to the rock on New-London beach, the bower on her favourite hill, or so feelingly describe the charms of nature! Can he indeed realize in her representative those alluring graces, that pensive sweetness, those unrivalled virtues and that matchless worth, which he found in her, and which attracted, fixed and secured the youngest affections of his soul? Impossible! Or could the author even make it out that Alonzo was deceived by a person so nearly resembling Melissa, that the difference could not be distinguished, yet to his readers he must unveil the deception, and of course the story will end in disappointment; it will leave an unpleasant and disagreeable impression on the mind, which in novel writing is certainly wrong. It is proved, as clearly as facts can prove, that he has permitted Melissa to die, and since she is dead, it is totally beyond his power to bring her to life—and so his history is intrinsically good for nothing.” Be not quite so hasty, my zealous censor. Did we not tell you that we were detailing facts? that we held the pencil of nature? that our portraits were true to life? Shall we disguise or discolour truth to please your taste? Have we not told you that disappointments are the lot of life, the inseparable attendants of man? Have we not, according to the advice of the moralist, led Alonzo to the temple of philosophy, the shrine of reason, and the sanctuary of religion? If all these fail; if in them he cannot find a balsam sufficient to heal his wounded bosom, then, if in despite of graves and tomb-stones, Melissa will come to his relief; will pour the balm of consolation over his anguished soul, cynical critic, can the author help it? It was indeed Melissa, the identical Melissa, whom Alonzo ascended a tree to catch a last view of, as she walked up the avenue to the old mansion, after they parted at the draw-bridge, on the morning of the day when she was so mysteriously removed. “Melissa!”—“Alonzo!”—were all they could articulate, and frown not, my fair readers, if we tell you that she was instantly in his arms, while he pressed his ardent lips to her glowing cheek! Sneer not, ye callous hearted insensibles, ye fastidious prudes, if we inform you that their tears fell in one immingling shower; that their sighs wafted in one blended breeze. VOL. II. T 2 The sudden opening of the door aroused them to a sense of their improper situation— for who but must consider it improper to find a young lady locked in the arms of a gentleman to whom she had just been introduced! The opening of the door therefore caused them quickly to change their position; not so hastily however but that the young officer, who then entered the room, had a glimpse of it. “Aha!” said he, “Have I caught you! Is my philosophic Plato so soon metamorphosed to a bon ton enamarato? But a few hours ago, Sir, and you were proof against the whole arcana of beauty, and all the artillery of the graces; but no sooner are you for one moment tete a tete with a fashionable belle, than your heroism and your resolutions are vanquished, your former ties dissolved, and your deceased charmer totally forgotten or neglected, by the virtue of a single glance. Well; so it is—Amor vincit omnia, is my motto; to thee, all-conquering beauty, our firmest determinations must yield. I cannot censure you for discovering, though late, that one living object is really of more intrinsic value than two dead ones. Indeed, Sir, I must really applaud your discrimination and discernment.” “The laws of honour,” said Alonzo, smiling, “compel me to submit to your raillery and deception—I am in your power, Sir.” “I acknowledge,” returned the officer, “that I have a little deceived you; my story was fiction founded on truth—the true novel, or lover style. But for the deceptive part, you may thank your little gipsy of a nymph there, (pointing to Melissa;) she planned and I executed.” “How ready you gentlemen are,” replied Melissa, “when accused of impropriety, to cast the blame on the defenceless! So it was in the beginning, and so it is still. But you must remember that Alonzo has yet to hear my story; there, Sir, I have the advantage of you.” “There, I confess,” said he, looking at Haventon, “you will be too hard for me, and so I will dismiss the subject.” Melissa then introduced the young officer to Alonzo by the appellation of Captain Wilmot. “He is the son of a deceased uncle,” said she; “a cousin to whom I am much indebted, as you shall hereafter know.” A coach drove up to the door. “We must prepare for a short ride,” said Wilmot to Haventon; “this is our uncle's house in town, where he resides in winter, but in summer is kept by his steward. We chose it for the scene of our late comedy. I will now introduce you to Col. Bloomfield at his villa, about two miles from the city; you will have no objection to breakfast with us there, if it be only to keep our cousin Melissa in countenance.” Haventon did not hesitate to accept the invitation; they immediately therefore entered the coach, a servant took charge of Alonzo's carriage, and they drove to the country seat of Col. Bloomfield, who with his family received Alonzo with much friendship and politeness. Wilmot had apprized them of Haventon's arrival in town, and of course he was expected. Col. Bloomfield was about fifty years old; his manners were majestically grave and commanding, yet polished and polite. He was a member of the state legislature, and Colonel of the city guards, which stations he had held for several years. His family consisted of an amiable wife considerably younger than himself, and two sons; the eldest about ten years of age, the other seven. Harmony and cheerfulness reigned in this family, which diffused tranquility and ease to all its members and its guests. It was agreed that Alonzo should pass a few days at the house of Melissa's uncle, when she was to accompany him to Connecticut. Capt. Wilmot, with some other officers, was recruiting for the army, where his regiment then lay, and which he was shortly to rejoin. He could not therefore be constantly at his uncle's, though he was principally there while Haventon stayed, but being absent the day after the latter arrived, Melissa and Alonzo having retired to a room separate from the family, she gave him the following account of what happened after they parted at the old mansion. “The morning after you left me,” she said, “Jeffrey came there early and called to be let in; I immediately went to the gate, opened it, and let down the bridge. He informed me my aunt had suddenly and unexpectedly returned that morning, in company with a strange gentleman, and had sent him for the keys, as she intended to visit me immediately. I endeavoured to persuade him to leave the keys in my possession, engaging to make all easy with my aunt when she arrived. This, though with much reluctance, he at length consented to, and departed. Soon after aunt Martha came herself, and without much ceremony, demanded the keys, insinuating that I had obtained them from Jeffrey by imposition, and for dishonourable purposes. This aroused my spirit, and I answered by assuring her that whatever purposes persecution and cruelty had compelled me to adopt, my conscience, under present circumstances, approved them, and I refused to give her the keys. She then ordered me to prepare to leave the mansion, and accompany her to her residence at the house of Jeffrey. I told her that as I had been placed there by my father, I should not consent to a removal unless by his express orders. She instantly left me, declaring she would soon let me know her authority was not thus to be trampled upon with impunity. “I immediately raised the bridge and made fast the gate, determining they should so remain until evening. The day passed away without other occurrence worthy of note, and soon as it was dark, I opened the gate, and cautiously let down the bridge, then returned to the building, and placed a candle, as we had concerted, at the window. Shortly after I heard a carriage roll over the bridge and proceed up the avenue. My heart fluttered; I wished—I hardly knew what I did wish, but I feared I was about to act improperly, having no other idea but that it was you, Alonzo, who was approaching. The carriage stopped near the door, a footstep ascended the stairs; judge of my surprise and agitation when my father entered the chamber! A maid, and two men servants, followed him. He directed me to make immediate preparations for leaving the house, which command, I obeyed with a heart too full for utterance. Soon as I was ready we entered the carriage, which drove rapidly away. As we passed out of the gate, I looked back at the mansion, and saw the light of the candle, which I had forgotten to remove, streaming from the window, and it was by an extraordinary effort that I prevented myself from fainting. “The carriage proceeded as near as I could judge about ten miles, when we halted at an inn for the night, except my father, who returned home on horseback, leaving me at the inn in company with the servants, where the carriage also remained. The maid was a person who had been attached to me from my infancy. I asked her whether she could explain these mysterious proceedings. `All I know, Miss, I will tell you,' said she: `your father received a letter to-day from Miss Martha, which put him in a terrible fluster; he immediately ordered his carriage and directed us to attend him; he met your aunt at a tavern somewhere away back, and she told him that the gentleman who used to come to our house so much once, had planned to carry you off from the place where you lived with her; so your father concluded to send you to your uncle's in Carolina, and said I must go with you; and to tell you the truth Miss, I was not displeased with it, for your father has grown so sour of late that we have little peace in the house.' By this I found that my fate was fixed, and I gave myself up for some time to unavailing sorrow. The maid informed me that my mother was well, which was one sweet consolation among my many troubles; whether my father had apprized her of his intention to remove me, the maid could not tell. “The next morning we pursued our journey, and I was hurried on by rapid stages until we reached the Chesapeak, where with the maid and one man servant I was put on board a packet for Charleston, at which place we arrived in due time. My uncle with his family received me with much tenderness; the servant delivered him a package of letters from my father. The carriage with one servant had returned from the Chesapeak to Connecticut. The maid and the other servant experiencing ill health, and not liking the country, returned home in about two months. “My father had but one brother and two sisters; my uncle here is the youngest of the family. One of my aunts, she who was my protectress at the old mansion, you have seen; the other was the mother of Wilmot; she married very young to a gentleman in Hartford, of that name, who fell before the walls of Louisbourg, in the old French war; his lady did not long survive him; her health, VOL. II. U which had been for some time declining, received so serious a shock by this catastrophe, that she died a few months after the melancholy tidings arrived, leaving their only child, then an infant, whom they named Alfred, to the protection of his relations, who, when he arrived at a suitable age, placed him at school. “My grandfather, who had the principal management of Mr. Wilmot's estate, sent my uncle, then young and unmarried, to Hartford for the purpose of transacting the necessary business: there he became acquainted with and addressed a young lady eminent for beauty and loveliness, but without fortune, the daughter of a poor mechanic. His father when informed of this attachment, in a very peremptory manner, ordered him to break off the connexion on pain of his highest displeasure. But such is the force of early impressions, [Melissa sighed,] that he found it impossible to submit to these stern injunctions; a clandestine marriage ensued, and my grandfather's maledictions in consequence. The union was however soon dissolved; my uncle's lady died in about twelve months after their marriage, and shortly after the birth of their first child, which was a daughter. Inconsolable and comfortless, he put the child out to nurse, and travelled to the south. After wandering about for some time, he took up his residence in Charleston, where he amassed a splendid fortune. He finally married an amiable and respectable woman, whose tenderness, though it did not entirely remove, yet greatly alleviated the pangs of early sorrow, and this, added to the little blandishments of a young family, fixed him in a state of more contentedness than he once ever expected to experience. His daughter, by his first wife, when she became of proper age, was placed at an eminent boarding-school, where she remained until within about two years before I came here, when her father sent and brought her home. She it was who, as I once informed you, I expected to pass the summer with me at Bloomfield Vale, but ill health prevented her visit. Alfred was educated at Harvard College; after having graduated he came to this place on our uncle's request, and has since remained in the family. “Soon after I arrived here my uncle came into my chamber one day, `Melissa,' said he, `I find by your father's letters that he considers you to have formed an improper attachment; I wish you to give me a true statement of the matter, and if any thing can be done to effect a reconciliation, you may depend upon my assistance. I have seen some troubles in this way myself, in early days; perhaps my counsel may be of service.' “I immediately gave a correct account of every particular circumstance from the time of my first acquaintance with you until my arrival at his house. He sat some time silent, and then told me that my father, he believed, had drawn the worst side of the picture; that he had urged him to exert every means in his power to reclaim me to obedience; that Bowman was to follow me within a few months, and that if I still refused to yield him my hand, my father positively and solemnly declared he would discard me for ever, and strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the same. `I well know my brother's temper,' continued he; `the case is difficult, but something must be done. I shall immediately write to your father, advising him not to proceed too rashly; in the mean time we will consider what measures to pursue. You must not, my niece, you must not be sacrificed.' “So saying, he left me, with the consolation that instead of a tyrant I had found a friend in my new protector. “Alfred was made acquainted with the affair, and many were the plans projected for my benefit, and abandoned as indefeasible, till an event happened which called forth all the fortitude of my uncle to support it, and operated in the end to free me from persecution. “My uncle's daughter was of a very delicate and sickly constitution, and her health evidently decreasing after coming to this place, she was sent to a village on the high hills of Santee, where she remained some time; she then went to one of the inland towns in North Carolina, from whence she had but just returned with Alfred when I arrived. Afterwards I accompanied her to Georgetown and other places, attended by her father, so that she was little more known in Charleston than myself. But all answered no purpose towards the restoration of her health; a confirmed hectic carried her off in the bloom of youth. I was but a few months older than she; her name was Melissa, a name which a pious grandmother VOL. II. U 2 had borne, and was therefore retained in the family. Our similarity of age, and in some measure of appearance; our being so little known in Charleston, and our names being the same, suggested to Alfred the idea of imposing upon my father by passing off my cousin's death as my own. This would at least deter Bowman from prosecuting his intended journey to this place; it would also give time for farther deliberation, and might so operate on my father's feelings as to soften that obduracy of temper which deeply disquieted himself and others, and thus finally be productive of happily effecting the desired purpose. “My uncle was too seriously overwhelmed with grief to be particularly consulted on this plan. He however intrusted Alfred to act with full powers, and to use his name for my interest if necessary. Wilmot therefore procured a publication of my cousin's death in the Connecticut papers, particularly at New-London, the native place of Bowman. In Charleston it was generally supposed that it was the niece, and not the daughter of my uncle, who had died; this imposition was likewise practised on the sexton, who keeps the register of deaths. Alfred then wrote a letter to my father, in my uncle's name, stating the particulars of my cousin's death, and applying them to me. The epitaph on her tomb-stone would with equal propriety apply either to her or to me, as would also the account of her death in the gazettes. “Confident that the news must reach you, our next object was to give you correct information respecting the facts. I consulted with Alfred how this might be done. `My dear cousin,' said he, `I am determined to see you happy before I relinquish the business I have undertaken. Letters are a precarious mode of communication; I will make a journey to Connecticut, find out Haventon, visit your friends, and see how the plan operates. I am known to your father, who has ever treated me as a relative. I will return as speedily as possible, and we shall then know what measures are best next to be adopted.' I requested him to unfold the deception to my mother, and if he found it expedient, to Vincent also and the Berghers, on whose friendship and confidence I was sure he might safely rely. “He soon departed, and returned in about two months. He found my parents in extreme distress on account of my supposed death; my mother's grief had brought her on the bed of sickness; but when Alfred undeceived her she rapidly recovered. My father observed to Wilmot that he seriously regretted opposing my inclinations, and that were it possible the steps he had taken could be retraced he should act in a very different manner, as he was not only deprived of me, but of Edgar also, who had gone to Holland in an official capacity, soon after receiving the tidings of my death. `I am now childless,' he said, in tears. Alfred's feelings were moved, and could you then have been found, he would have disclosed to my father the facts as they really were; but lest he should relapse into former prejudices and austerities, Wilmot dare not reveal to him the secret. “On inquiring at your father's, at Vincent's and at Bergher's, he could learn nothing of you, except that you had departed in search of me. Vincent conjectured you had gone to New-London, on the supposition that I might be there. Alfred therefore determined to proceed to that place immediately. He then confidentially unfolded the scheme to your family, to Vincent and the Berghers, desiring that if you returned you would repair instantly to Charleston. My father was still to be kept in ignorance. “Alfred went on to New-London: by Glenford he was informed of your interview with him, but from whence you then came, or whither you went, he knew not; and after making the strictest inquiry he could learn nothing more. By a vessel in that port bound directly for Holland he wrote an account of the whole affair to Edgar, mentioning his unsuccessful search to find you; he then returned to Charleston. “Wilmot was apprized by our friends of the circumstances which occasioned my sudden removal from the old mansion. The morning you left me you were discovered by my aunt who was passing the road in a chair attended by a gentleman with whom she had then but recently become acquainted. They immediately drove to Jeffrey's hut; finding that he had left the keys with me, she sent him for them, and on my refusing to give them up, she came herself, as I have before related, but as she succeeded no better than her messenger, she returned and secretly despatched an express to my father, informing him of the circumstances, adding her suspicions of our having had an interview, and that from my refusing to yield the keys, there was little doubt but we had formed a plan for my escape. Alarmed at this information, my father immediately ordered his carriage, drove to the mansion, and removed me as previously stated.” “But who was the strange gentleman with your aunt?” inquired Alonzo. “This I will also tell you,” answered Melissa, “though it unfolds a tale which reflects no great honour on my family. “Hamblin was the name which this man assumed; he said he had been an eminent merchant in New-York, and left it about the time it was taken by the British. He lodged at an inn where my aunt frequently called when she was out collecting rents; there he first introduced himself, and gained her esteem by art and insidiousness. He accompanied her on visits to the tenants, and assisted in settling her accounts. He told her that when the war came on, he turned his effects into money, which he had with him, and was now in pursuit of some country place where he might purchase a residence to remain during the war. To make the story short as possible, he finally so far seduced her affections that she accepted his hand, and contrary to my father's advice, married him; he shortly persuaded her to sell her possessions under pretence of removing to some populous town and living in style; her property however was no sooner sold, which my father bought for ready cash at a low price, than he found means to realize the money, and absconded. It was afterwards discovered that his real name was Brenton; that he had left a wife and family in Virginia in indigent circumstances, where by dissipation he had wasted an ample fortune inherited from his father, and involved himself deeply in debt. He had scarcely time to get off with the booty he swindled from my aunt, when his creditors from Virginia were at his heels. He fled to the British at New-York, where he rioted for a few months, was finally stabbed by a soldier in a fracas, and died the next day. He was about thirty-five years old. All these troubles bore so heavily upon my aunt, that she fell into a decline, and died about six months ago. “After Alfred returned from Connecticut, he wrote frequently to Vincent and also to Bergher, but could obtain no intelligence concerning you. It would be needless, Alonzo, to describe my conjectures, my anxieties, my feelings! The death of my cousin and aunt kept me in crape until at the instance of Wilmot I put it off yesterday morning at my uncle's house in town, which Alfred proposed for the scene of action, after he discovered the cause of my fainting at the theatre. I did not readily come into his plan to deceive you: `Suffer me,' he said, `to try the constancy of your Leander; I much doubt whether he would swim the Hellespont for you.' This aroused my pride and confidence, and I permitted him to proceed.” Alonzo then gave Melissa a minute account of all the events he had experienced from the time of their separation until he met with her the preceding day. At the mention of Bowman's fate, Melissa sighed; “With how many vain fears,” said she, “was I perplexed, lest by some means he should discover my existence and place of residence, after he, alas! was silent in the tomb!” Alonzo farther told her that he received a letter from Edgar after his arrival in Holland, and that he wrote him an answer just as he left Paris, informing him of his reasons for returning to America. When the time arrived that Haventon and Miss Bloomfield were to set out for Connecticut, Melissa's uncle and Alfred accompanied them to Georgetown, where an affectionate parting took place; the latter returned to Charleston, and the former proceeded on their journey. Philadelphia was then in possession of the British troops. Alonzo found Dr. Franklin's agent at Chester, transacted his business, went on, arrived at Vincent's, where he left Melissa, and repaired immediately to his father's. Their friends were most joyfully surprised at their arrival. Melissa's mother was sent for to Vincent's; let imagination paint the VOL. II. X meeting! As yet however they were not prepared to undeceive her father. Haventon found his parents in penurious circumstances indeed. His father having the preceding summer been too much indisposed to manage his little farm with attention, and being unable to hire labourers, his crops had yielded but a scanty supply, and he had been compelled to sell most of his stock to answer pressing demands. With great joy they welcomed their son, whom they had given up as lost. “You still find your father poor, Alonzo,” said the old gentleman, “but you find him still honest. From my inability to labour we have latterly been a little more straitened than usual, but having now recovered my health, I trust that difficulty will soon be removed.” Haventon asked his father if he had ever known Doctor Franklin. “We were schoolmates,” he replied, “and were intimately acquainted after we became young men in business for ourselves. We have done each other favours: I once divided my money with Franklin on an urgent occasion to him; he afterwards repaid me with ample interest; he will never forget it.” Alonzo then related all the incidents of his travels, minutely particularizing the disinterested conduct of Franklin, and presented to his father the vouchers and documents testifying the restoration of his property. The old man fell on his knees, and with streaming tears offered devout thanks to the great Dispenser of all mercies. Haventon next visited Melissa's father who received him with much complacency: “I have injured you,” said he, “my young friend, deeply injured you; but in doing this have inflicted a wound still deeper in my own breast; a wound which can never be healed.” “Permit not a renewal of your sorrows, Sir,” said Alonzo; “the past is beyond recall. A subject of some importance to me is the design of my present visit: true it is that your daughter was the object of my earliest affection, an affection which my heart must ever retain; but being separated by the will of Providence—for I view Providence as overruling all events for wise purposes—I left my country and wandered through distant lands. Time, you know it is said, Sir, will blunt the sharpest thorns of sorrow—[the old man sighed.] In my travels I have found a lady so nearly resembling your daughter that I was induced to sue for her hand, and have been so happy as to obtain the promise of it. The favour I have to ask of you, Sir, is only that you will permit the marriage ceremony to be celebrated in your house, as you know my father is poor, his house small and inconvenient, and that you will also honour me by giving the lady away. In receiving her from your hands I shall in some measure realize former happy anticipations; I shall receive her in the character of Melissa.” “Ah!” exclaimed Col. Bloomfield, “were it in my power—could I but give you the original!—But how vain that wish!—Yes, my young friend, your request is freely granted; I will take upon myself the preparations; name your day, and if the lady is portionless, in that she shall be to me a Melissa.” Alonzo expressed thankful gratitude, and after appointing that day week, departed. Invitations were once more sent abroad for the wedding of Alonzo and Melissa. Few indeed knew it to be the real Melissa, but they were generally apprized of Haventon's avowed reasons for preferring the celebration at the house of Col. Bloomfield. The evening before the day on which the marriage was to take place, Haventon and Miss Bloomfield were sitting with the Vincents in an upper room, when a person rapped at the door below: Vincent went down, and immediately returned, introducing, to the joy and surprise of the company, Edgar! Here again we shall leave it for imagination to depict the scene of an affectionate brother meeting a tender and only sister whom he supposed long since dead! He had been at his father's and his mother let him into the secret, when he immediately hastened to Vincent's. He told them that he did not stay long in Holland; that after receiving Alonzo's letter from Paris he felt an unconquerable propensity to return, and soon sailed for America, arrived at Boston, came to New-Haven, took orders in the ministry, and reached home that day. Wilmot's letter he never received. He informed them that the VOL. II. X 2 Berghers were at his father's, and also some relatives whom his mother had invited. The next morning ushered in the day on which the hero and heroine of our story were to consummate their felicity. No cross purposes approached to intervene their happiness; no determined rival, no obdurate father, no watchful, scowling aunt, to interrupt their transports. It was the latter end of May; Nature was arrayed in her richest ornaments, and odoured with her sweetest perfumes. The sun blended its mild lustre with the landscape's lovely green; light-winged breezes frolicked amidst the flowers; the spring-birds caroled in varying strains, “The air was fragrance and the world was love.” Evening was appointed for the ceremony, and Edgar was to be the officiating clergyman, “To tie those bands which nought but death can sever.” When the hour arrived they repaired to the house of Col. Bloomfield where numerous guests had assembled. Melissa was ushered into the bridal apartment and seated in advance of a brilliant circle of ladies. She was attired in robes `white as southern clouds,' spangled with silver, and fringed with deep gold lace; her hair flowed in artless ringlets, decorated by a wreath of flowers; a rich gem blazed upon her bosom, and a diamond clasped the green girdle which encircled her waist. She had regained all her former loveliness; the rose and the lily again mingled their tinges in her cheek; again pensive sprightliness beamed in her eye, and the undulations of beauty played in tremulous colourings over her fine features. Alonzo was then introduced and took his station at the side of Melissa; his father and mother came next, who were placed at their right hand; Melissa's parents followed and were stationed at their left. Edgar then came and took his seat in front, when the guests were summoned, who filled the room. After a short pause, the intended bride, the brideg room and Edgar arose; the latter turning to Alonzo's parents, asked their sanction to the proposed union; they bowed assent; then addressing his own father with emotions that scar cely suffered him to articulate, “Do you, Sir,” said he, “present this lady to that gentleman?” A solemn silence prevailed in the room. Melissa was extremely agitated as her father, slowly rising, with downcast eyes and mournful aspect, took her trembling hand, and conveyed it into Alonzo's; “May the smiles of Heaven rest upon you,” he sadly said; “may future blessings crown your present happy prospects—and may your latter days never be imbittered by the premature loss of near and dear—” Pungent grief here choked his utterance; bitter sighs swelled his bosom, and large drops coursed down his furrowed cheeks— At that moment Melissa sank upon her knees; “Dear father!” she exclaimed, bursting into tears, “pardon deception!—acknowledge your daughter—your own Melissa!” Her father started—he gazed at her with scrutinizing attention, and fell back into his chair.—“My daughter!” he cried; “merciful Heaven! my daughter!” The guests caught the contagious sympathy; convulsive sobs arose from all parts of the room. Melissa's father clasped her in his arms; “And do I receive thee, my child, from the dead?” he said; “I am anxious to hear the mystery unfolded. But first let the solemn rites for which we are assembled be concluded; let not an old man's anxiety interrupt the ceremony.” “As you are acquainted with my circumstances,” said Alonzo, “will you not esteem it ungenerous to take advantage of your present feelings, Sir, seeing I am unable to support your daughter according to her deserts and your own expectations?” “Leave that to me, my young friend,” replied her father; “I have enough; my children are restored, and I am happy.” Melissa soon resumed her former station; the indissoluble union was cemented; they sat down to the wedding feast, while joy and felicity glowed in every countenance. Before the company retired, Edgar related the most prominent incidents of Alonzo and Melissa's history, since they had been absent. The guests listened with attention; they applauded the conduct of our new bride and bridegroom, in which Melissa's father cordially joined; they rejoiced to find that Alonzo's parents had regained their fortune, and copious libations were poured forth in honour of the immortal Franklin. And now, reader of sensibility, indulge the pleasing sensations of thy bosom, for Alonzo and Melissa are MARRIED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Here spring its earliest buds displays, Here, latest on the leafless sprays, The plumy nations sing; The vernal shower, the summer clear, The autumnal stores, the winter drear, For thee new pleasures bring. Humphreys. Alonzo and Melissa are married, said we to the reader in closing our last chapter. And here, were we to adopt the method of some modern novelists, we might close our history, and leave it for imagination to paint the sequel. They seem to think it in style to leave something to guess at, but we choose to follow the old-fashioned course, and like the lawyer in his declaration, tell the whole story. Besides, there are some mysteries which, if not elucidated, would render the narrative incomplete—the finishing stroke would still be wanting. Then, though the denouement has been developed, the catastrophe displayed, we shall, fashionable or not, proceed a little beyond these events before we consign our volumes to public scrutiny. Alonzo's father soon realized the happy effects of Franklin's generous and discriminate proceedings. He not only recovered the principal of the fortune he had lost, but the damages and the interest. Even his former possessions, which had been both sold and bought by fraud and collusion, were yielded up without difficulty; so that although like Job he had seen affliction, like him his latter days were better than his beginning. But wearied with the active and tumultuous scenes of life, he did not again enter into mercantile business, but placing his money at interest in safe hands, lived retired in the country. A few days after the wedding, as Melissa was sitting with Alonzo, Edgar and her parents, she asked her father whether the old mansion was inhabited. “Not by human beings,” he replied; “since it has fallen into my hands I have leased it to two or three different families, who all soon left it under the foolish pretence or impression of hearing strange noises and seeing frightful objects; and such is the superstition of people that no one now will venture to try it again, though I suppose the inhabitants to consist only of rats and mice.” Melissa then informed them of all that had happened while she was there; the alarming noises and horrible appearances she had been witness to, and in which she was confident her senses had not deceived her. Exceedingly astonished at her relation, it was determined that some persons should be sent to the mansion in order to find whether any discoveries could be made which might lead to an elucidation of circumstances so singular and extraordinary. They consequently selected five stout fellows and despatched them to the place with orders to remain in the building through the night; to return the following day and report the result of their observations. Hickory canes were the only weapons they carried, nor did they expect to use even these. Two days however elapsed and they came not back. Persons were sent in search of them, but they were nowhere to be found; nor could any VOL. II. Y traces of them be perceived either within the house or inclosure, except that the draw-bridge was down, the gate and outer door of the building unlocked, which evinced that the men had been there. Surprised at these alarming incidents, they resolved upon taking measures more effecually to investigate so mysterious an affair. For this purpose, Edgar and Alonzo chose out thirty men among the tenants and labourers of Col. Bloomfield, and in the neighbourhood, armed them with muskets and swords, and repaired to the mansion, where they arrived in the dusk of the evening, having chosen that season as most favourable to their designs. They found the drawbridge, gate and door, as the last messengers said they had left them. When they came to the house they cautiously proceeded to the chamber, where they struck a fire and lit candles, which they had brought with them. It was then agreed to plant twenty of the men at suitable distances in the yard around the mansion, and retain ten in the chamber with Alonzo and Edgar. The men who were placed without the building were stationed behind trees, stumps or rocks, and where no objects presented they lay flat on the ground, with orders not to stir nor discover themselves let what would ensue, unless an alarm should be given from the house by the report of a gun. Alonzo and Edgar were armed with pistols and side arms, and having bolted the outer door, posted themselves with the ten men in the chamber, taking care that the lights should not shine against the window shutters, so that nothing could be discovered from without. Things thus arranged they preserved almost an entire silence, no one being allowed to speak except in a low whisper. For a long time no sounds were heard except the hollow roar of winds in the neighbouring forest, their whistling around the angles of the mansion, or the hoarse murmurs of the distant surge. They watched until about midnight, when they were alarmed by noises in the rooms below, among which they could distinguish footsteps and human voices. Alonzo and Edgar then taking each a pistol in one hand and a drawn sword in the other, ordered their men to follow them silently, prepared for action. Coming to the head of the stairs they saw a brilliant light streaming into the hall; they therefore concluded to take no candles, and to prevent discovery, took off their shoes. When they came into the hall opposite the door of the room from whence the noise and light proceeded, they perceived twelve men, genteely dressed, sitting around a table, on which were a number of glasses and several decanters of liquor, as also a quantity of gold and silver coin. Alonzo and his party stood a few minutes listening to the following discourse which was held among this ghostly gentry. “Well boys! we have made a fine haul this trip.” “Yes; but poor Bob, though, was plump'd over by the d—d skulkers.” “Ay, and had we not tugg'd bravely at the oars, they would have hook'd us.” “Those rascally cow-boys detained us too long.” “Well, well, never mind it; let us toss round the wine and then divide the spoil.” “Yes, yes; first wine and then money.” “But where are our prisoners?” “Safe; perfectly safe in limbo, boy.” “And what is to be done with them?” “Tomorrow night we are to take them across the ferry; then let them get back if they can.” “That will do; they thought to nab us, but we were too old for them.” At this moment Alonzo and Edgar, followed by their men, rushed into the room, crying “Surrender, or you are all dead men!” at the same time discharging a pistol into the ceiling. In an instant the room was involved in total darkness; a loud crash was heard, then a scampering about the floor, and a noise as if several doors were shut with violence. Immediately the report of guns were heard around the mansion. One of the men flew up stairs and brought a light, but to their utter amazement no person was to be discovered in the room except their own party. The table with its apparatus, and the chairs on which those now invisible beings sat, had all disappeared as if VOL. II. Y 2 by magic, not a single trace of them remaining. While they stood petrified with astonishment, the men from without called for admittance. The door being opened, a wounded stranger was led in, whom they immediately discovered to be one of those they had seen at the table. The men who were stationed in the yard informed that some time before the alarm was given, they saw a number of persons crossing the inclosure, from the western part thereof, towards the house; that immediately after the report of the pistol, they discovered several people running from the building towards the wall; they hailed them, which being disregarded, they fired and one fell, who was the wounded man they had brought in. The others, though they pursued them, got off. The prisoner's wound was not dangerous; the ball had pierced his arm and glanced upon his breast. They dressed his wound as well as they could, and then requested him to unfold the circumstances of the suspicious appearance in which he was involved. “First promise me on your honour,” said the stranger, “that you will use your influence to prevent my being punished or imprisoned.” To this they readily agreed, on condition that he would conceal nothing from them, and he gave them the following relation. That they were part of a gang of Illicit Traders; men who had combined for the purpose of carrying on a secret and illegal commerce with the British army on Long-Island, which, contrary to the existing laws, they supplied with provisions, brought off English goods in exchange, and sold them at a very extortionate price. But this was not all; they also brought over large quantities of counterfeit continental money; this they put off among the Americans for live-stock, poultry and produce, which they carried to the Island. The counterfeit money they purchased by merely paying for the printing; the British having obtained copies of the American emission, struck immense sums in New-York, and insidiously sent it out into the country in order to sink our currency. This gang was likewise connected with the Cow-Boys, who made it their business to steal, from the farmers about the country, not only milch-cows and fat cattle, but also hogs and sheep, which they drove by night to some convenient place on the shores of the Sound, where these thief-partners received the plunder and conveyed it to the British. “In our excursions across the Sound,” continued the wounded man, “we frequently observed this mansion, which from every appearance we were convinced was uninhabited; we therefore selected it as a suitable place for our future rendezvous, which had heretofore been only in the open woods. To cross the moat we dragged up an old canoe from the sea shore, and concealed it in the bushes soon as we recrossed from the mansion. To get over the wall we used ladders of ropes, placing a flat piece of thick board on the points of the spikes. We found more difficulty in entering the house; at length however we succeded by tearing away a small part of the building, and fitting in a door so exactly and so naturally painted that it could not be distinguished from the adjoining parts. This door was so constructed that on pressing a spring it would instantly fly open, and when unrestrained would voluntarily shut with considerable force. Finding the house so eligible for our purpose, and fearing that at some future time we might be disturbed either by the owner or some tenant, we cut similar apertures through various parts of the building into the yard, and also into all the rooms, so that on emergency we could traverse every apartment without access to the usual passages. Trap doors on the same construction communicated with the cellar; the table which you saw us sitting around stood upon one of these, which on your abrupt appearance, was, with its contents, after the candles were extinguished, precipitated below, and we made our escape by those secret passages, judging that although you had seen us, if we could get off, you would be unable to find out any thing which might lead to a discovery, as the trap-door, by force of the secret spring, closed of itself soon as it became disburdened of its contents. “A circumstance shortly happened which tended to embarrass our plans, and at first seemed to menace their overthrow. Our assembling at the mansion was irregular, as occasion and circumstances occurred; sometimes not to exceed once a week; at others more frequently, and always in the night, though of late we have made it almost our constant residence. Late one evening as we were proceeding to the building, and had arrived near it, one of the chamber windows was suddenly opened, and a light issued from within. We entered the house with caution, and soon discovered that some person was in the room from whence we had seen the light. We remained until all was silent and then repaired to the chamber by one of our secret doors, and to our inexpressible surprise, beheld a beautiful young lady in bed and asleep in the room. We cautiously retired, and reconnoitering all parts of the mansion, found she was the only inhabitant, though there were two beds in her chamber. The singularity of her being there alone is a circumstance we have never been able to discover, but it gave us fair hopes of easily procuring her ejectment. We then immediately withdrew and made preparations to dispossess the fair tenant of premises to which we considered ourselves more properly entitled, as possessing a prior incumbency. We did not effect the completion of our apparatus under three or four days; and once while it was constructing, we returned to the house about midnight in order to hold consultation respecting some of our plans and transactions. As we approached the building it seems the lady heard us, for again she flung up a window and held out a candle; we skulked from the light, in hopes she would not discover us. After entering the house we were silent and still until we supposed her to be asleep, which we found to be the case on going to her apartment. We then commenced our business in the rooms below, and while there, one of the company who was a little intoxicated, overset a table we had been sitting around; we feared this might awake her; but not hearing any movement in her chamber, we continued our sitting till towards day, and then departed. “Soon as we were fully prepared we returned to the mansion at about eleven o'clock in the evening. On entering the house, by the inattention of one of our people, the door flew to with force, the sound of which must have alarmed the lady as we immediately heard her descending the stairs, and retreated to our hiding places. She did not stay long; on he retiring to the chamber we returned to put our scheme into execution. “When we found he was in a sound sleep we stationed one near her bed, who by a rap upon the floor with a cane, evidently aroused her in a fright. Noises were then made below, the person in her room whispering at the same time; she raised herself up, and he fled behind the curtains. Soon after she again lay down and he approached nearer the bed with a design to lay his hand, over which he had drawn a thin sheet-lead glove, upon her face: but discovering her arm on the outside of the counterpane, he grasped it; she screamed and sprang up; the man then left the apartment. As it was not our intention to injure the lady, but only to drive her from the house, we concluded we had sufficiently alarmed her, and having extinguished the lights were about to depart, when we heard her descending the stairs. She came down and examined the doors; one of our party, who had secreted himself in a closet adjoining the hall, then whispering with strong aspiration “away! away!” she darted up stairs, and we left the house. “We did not return the next night in order to give her time to get off; but the evening after we again repaired to the mansion, expecting that she had gone, but were disappointed. As it was late when we arrived she was asleep, and we found that more forcible measures must be resorted to before we could remove her, and for such measures we were amply prepared.” The stranger then unfolded the mysteries of that awful night when Melissa was so terrified by horrible appearances. One of the tallest of the gang was attired as has been described when he appeared by her bed-side. The white robe was a sheet stained in some parts with a liquid red mixture; the wound in his breast was artificial, and the apparent blood issuing therefrom was this red liquid pressed from a small bladder concealed under his robe. On his head and face he wore a mask with glass eyes; the mask was painted to suit their purposes. The bloody dagger was of wood, and painted also. Thus accoutred he took his stand near Melissa's bed; he first extinguished the candles she had left burning and then discharged a small pistol. Perceiving this had awakened her, a train of powder was fired in the adjoining room, opposite the secret door, which VOL. II. Z was left open so that the flash might illuminate her apartment; then several large cannon-balls, they had picked up on Long Island, and which they used as ballast, were rolled through the rooms over her head, imitative of thunder. The person in her chamber next uttered a horrible groan, and gliding along by her bed, took his stand behind the curtains near the foot. The noises below, the cry of murder, the firing of the second pistol, and the running up stairs, were all corresponding scenes to impress terror on her imagination. The pretended ghost then advanced in front of her bed, while lights were slowly introduced, which first shone faintly, until they were ushered into the room by the secret passage, exhibiting the man before her in all his horrific attitudes. On her shrieking and shrinking into bed, the lights were suddenly extinguished, and the person after commanding her to begone in a hoarse voice, passed again to the foot of the bed, shook it violently, and made a seeming attempt to get on it, when perceiving her to be springing up he fled out of the room by the private aperture, cautiously closed it and joined his companions. The operators had not yet completed their farce, or rather to Melissa, tragedy. They had framed an image of paste-board in human shape, arrayed it in black, its eyes being formed of ignis vulpina, vulgarly called fox fire,[8] [8] A sort of decayed, or rotten, phosphoric wood, which in the night appears like coals of fire, of a bright whitish colour. It emits a faint light. some of the same material being placed in its mouth wrapped in thin scarlet tiffany in order to give it the appearance of flame. They had also constructed a large combustible ball of paste-board, several inches thick, to which a match was affixed. The image they intended to convey into her room, place it before her bed, and while in that position to cover the ball with phosphorus, set the match on fire, and roll it across her chamber, and when it should burst, the image was to vanish by being suddenly conveyed out by the secret passage, which was to close the scene for that night. But Melissa having now arisen and lighted candles, the plan was defeated. While they were consulting how to proceed they heard her unlock her chamber door and slowly descend the stairs. Fearing a discovery they retired with their lights, and the person who had been in her chamber, not having yet stripped off his ghostly habiliments, lay down on one side of the hall. The man who had the image, crowded himself with it under the stairs she was descending. On her dropping the candle when she turned to flee to her room from the sight of the same object which appeared at her bed side, the fellow under the stairs presented the image at their foot; at the same instant the combustible ball was prepared and rolled through the hall; and when on its bursting she fainted, they began to grow alarmed; but finding she quickly revived and regained her apartment, they departed for that time from the house. “Our scheme,” continued the prisoner, “had the desired effect: on returning a few evenings after, we found the lady gone and the furniture removed. Several attempts were afterwards made to occupy the mansion, but we always succeeded in soon frightening the inhabitants away. “A few evenings since, on coming to the house, we heard a noise in one of the rooms adjoining the hall. On a cautious examination we perceived, by the light of a candle they had with them, five men in the apartment. Listening to their discourse, we found they were sent to make discoveries. We waited some time in hopes they would depart, but finding they intended to stay till morning, we soon determined how to act. As they were unarmed, and there being more than twenty of us then together, we suddenly rushed in upon them, and after a short scuffle made them all prisoners. They are now confined in a secret part of the building. Considering it not safe to liberate them, tomorrow evening they were to be conveyed to the Island and delivered to the British.” Edgar and Alonzo then directed their prisoner to lead them instantly to the place where their five messengers were confined, and then to show them the machinery of those secret doors, and how they were managed. This he did immediately. The springs were sunk in the wood, which being pressed by entering a gimblet hole with a pointed steel instrument that each of the gang always had about him, the door would fly open, shut, and fasten again of itself. On raising the trap door whereon VOL. II. Z 2 the twelve fellows sat when first discovered, they perceived in the cellar beneath, the table and chairs, with the decanters and glasses broken, as also the money which they secured. In one part of the cellar was a kind of cave, its mouth covered with boards and earth; here the company kept their furniture, and thither would they have removed it, had they not been so suddenly frightened away. Within this cavern was another trap-door fastened by one of those springs, which the prisoner opened, and there, in a deep dungeon, they found the five men, whom to their mutual joy they quickly released. The canoe they were shown secreted in the bushes beyond the canal. It was agreed that the prisoner should go before the proper authorities in a neighbouring town, and there, as state's evidence, make affidavit of what he had recited, and a complete development of the characters concerned in the business, when he was to be released. The man inquired to what town they were to proceed, which when they had informed him, “This,” said he, “will enable me to perform one act of justice before I leave the country, as leave it I must, immediately after I have given in my testimony, or I shall be assassinated by some of those who will be implicated in the transactions I have related.” He then told them that while he with his companions was prosecuting the illicit trade, a British ship came and anchored in the Sound, which they supplied with provisions; but that having at one time a considerable quantity on hand, the ship sent its boat with an officer and five men to fetch them; the officer with two of the hands came on shore, leaving the rest of the men in the boat. “As we were about to convey the provisions on board the boat,” continued the man, “a party of Americans rushed from the woods, fired upon us and wounded the officer in the thigh, who fell; `I shall be made prisoner and probably plundered,' said he, taking out his purse and handing it to me; `keep this, and if I live perhaps you may restore it to me when in prison, where I shall need it. Fly; alarm the boat's crew, and shift for yourselves.' The two sailors fled to the boat, which returned to the ship, and we also saved ourselves by flight. This happened about four months ago; the ship soon after sailed for New-York; the officer was imprisoned in the jail of the town to which we are going; I have twice been there for the purpose of restoring him the purse, but being a stranger I could not gain admission to the prison; with your assistance the measure may now be effected.” The man further informed them that they were several times near being taken by the Americans, and that in their last trip they were fired upon and one of their party killed. Soon as morning appeared they set out for the aforesaid town, after having dismissed their men, and when they arrived there Alonzo and Edgar accompanied their prisoner to the jail. On making their business known they were conducted into a dark and dirty apartment where were several captives in irons. The British officer was soon distinguished among them by his regimentals. Though enveloped in filth and dust, his countenance appeared familiar to Alonzo, and on a few moments recollection he recognized, in the manacled seamen, the generous midshipman, Jack Brown, who had so disinterestedly relieved him when he escaped from the prison in London! In the fervency of his feelings Alonzo flew to him and folded him in his arms. “What do I behold!” he cried; “my friend—my brave deliverer, in chains in my own country!” “The fortune of war, boy,” said Jack; “it might have been worse. But my lad, I am heartily glad to see you; how has it fared with you since you left old England.” “We will talk of that at a future time,” said Alonzo. There were then some American officers of distinction in the town with whom Edgar was acquainted, and to whom he applied for the release of the noble sailor. As there were several other British prisoners in the jail, it was agreed that a cartel should be immediately sent to New-York to exchange them. Alonzo had therefore the satisfaction to see the irons knocked off his liberal-hearted benefactor, and his prison doors opened. The man they had taken at the mansion returned him his purse, containing only twenty-five guineas, of which Brown gave him ten; “There boy,” said he, “you have been honest, so I will divide with you.” They then repaired to an inn; Jack, whose wound was healed, was put under the hands of a barber, cleaned, furnished with a change of clothes, and soon appeared in a new attitude. He informed them that soon after Haventon left England the Severn was ordered for America; that the price of provisions growing high, it had taken almost all his wages to support his family, though he was under lieutenant's pay, having been advanced to that station; that he had sent home his last remittance just before he was taken, reserving only the twenty-five guineas which had been restored him that day. “But I have never despaired,” said he; “the great Commodore of life orders all for the best. My tour of duty is to serve my king and country, and provide for my dear Poll and her chicks, which if I faithfully perform I shall gain applause from the Commander.” When the cartel was ready to depart, Haventon drawing Brown aside from the company, presented him with a draught of five hundred pounds sterling on a merchant in New-York, who privately transacted business with the Americans. “Take this my friend,” said he; “you can ensure it by converting it into bills of exchange on London. Though you once saw me naked and poor, I can now conveniently spare this sum, and it may assist you in buffeting the billows of life.” The affectionate tar, with tears of gratitude, clasped Alonzo to his bosom; in eloquent silence they separated, each fervently invoking Heaven for blessings on his mutual benefactor. The man who came with Haventon and Bloomfield from the mansion, went before the magistrates of the town and gave in his testimony and affidavit, by which it appeared that several eminent characters in Connecticut were concerned in the illicit trade. They then released him, after giving him the money they had found in the cellar, and he immediately left the town. Warrants were soon after issued for apprehending those illicit traders; several were taken who belonged to the gang, and some remotely connected therewith; but most of them absconded, so that the company were dispersed and their illegal trading schemes annihilated. When Alonzo and Edgar returned home and related their adventure, they were all astonished at the fortitude of Melissa by which she was enabled to support her spirits in a solitary mansion, amidst such great and so many terrors. Haventon now turned his attention to future prospects. It was time to select a place for domestic residence. He consulted Melissa, and she expressively mentioned the little rural village, where “Ere fate and fortune frown'd severe,” they had projected scenes of conjugal bliss, and planned the structure of their family edifice. “Do you not remember, Alonzo,” said she, “that I once remarked, `This shall be my Asylum?”' “Never can I forget it,” he replied; “and now the prediction shall be verified.” The scite formerly marked out, with an adjoining farm, was immediately purchased, and suitable buildings erected, to which they removed the ensuing summer. To this place they gave the name of Asylum, which it locally retains to the present day. Here did Melissa and Alonzo repose after the storms of adversity were past. Here did they realize all the happiness which the sublunary hand of time apportions to mortals. The varying seasons diversified their joys, except when Haventon was called with the militia of his country, in which he was honoured with a distinguished commission, to oppose the enemy, and this was not unfrequent, as in his country's defence he took a very conspicuous part; then would anxiety, incertitude and disconsolation possess the bosom of Melissa, until dissipated by his safe return. But the happy termination of the war soon removed all cause of these inquietudes. Shortly after the return of peace Alonzo received a letter from his friend, Jack Brown, dated at an interior parish in England, in which, after pouring forth abundance of gratitude, he stated that at the close of the war he returned to England and was discharged from the navy; that he then sold his house in town and removed into the country, where he had set up an inn with the sign of The Grateful American. “You have made us all happy,” said he; “my dear Poll blubbered like a fresh-water sailor in a hurricane when I told VOL. II. A a her of your goodness. My wife, my children—all hands upon deck are yours. We have a good run of business, and are now under full sail for the land of prosperity.” The clergyman of the village where Haventon resided having died, Edgar was called to the pastoral charge of this unsophisticated people. He shortly after married Katharine Bergher. The Baron Du Ruyter returned to Germany, accompanied by Roderick, who had been his aid-de-camp through the war, and whom the Baron intended to make the principal heir to his large estates. Alonzo and Melissa were frequently visited by their parents, as also by Vincent, his lady, and the Berghers, with many other friends and acquaintance, who all rejoiced in their felicity, after such a diversity of troubles. Alfred was generally once a year their guest, until at length he married and settled in mercantile business at Charleston. To our hero and heroine the native charms of their retired village were a source of ever pleasing variety. Spring, with its verdured fields, flowery meads, and vocal groves, its balmy gales, purling rills, and its evening whipperwill; summer, with its embowering shades reflected in the glassy lake, its mild showers, gay rainbow, its lightning, its thunder, and the long, pensive, yet sprightly notes of the solitary Strawberry-bird; autumn, with its mellow fruit, yellow foliage, falling leaf, and decaying verdure; winter, with its hoarse, rough blasts, icy bands, stormy skies, and snowy mantle—all tended to thrill, with sensations of pleasing transition, the feeling bosoms of Alonzo and Melissa, in their early chosen, long sought, but finally happy, secluded Asylum.
