      <field name="fulltext">THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ARTHUR CLENNING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1* CHAPTER I. “Domestic bliss, Thou only joy that hast surviv'd the fall.” Here would be the place to transcribe some of the incidents of that period, well known by the cant but significant name, “honey-moon.” Theocritus must lend his pastoral pencil, and St. Pierre his unrivalled powers of singing the rural life of love in the shades of such a retirement, to do ordinary justice to the history of their enjoyments. In days of enjoyment like theirs, the youthful imagination peoples all that surrounds them, with beings who sympathize with them in their felicity. It is true, though they were in the midst of a nature no less pleasant than formerly, they saw it not with the same eyes; for they were more intently occupied with each other. The want of the society of others of their kind was hardly perceived by them, who possessed in each other Whatever fancy forms of good and fair, Or lavish hearts could wish. The poor birds fluttered, shook their wings, and sung, and croaked with the joy of welcome, when they came forth, as formerly. But their fair mistress, though she saw them fed, as formerly, had almost forgotten to caress them. The lessons of Rescue came to a dead pause for a while, though she showed great shrewdness and penetration, using her eyes and senses to the utmost advantage. She often surprised them with proofs of her native sagacity, and self-taught proficiency. She saw the two happy beings, with whom she lived, at first, it may be, with some natural sensations of envy. But she never failed to evince, that from the first, she had felt all the ties and obligations of gratitude. Daily conversant with two beings, as amiable as they were happy, she soon added the ties of daily intercourse and affection to her first obligations. She appeared to love them with the earnest and simple affection of a child. Their will was a law, and their thoughts the measure of what was right. She saw them obliging, kind, and affectionate, in every word, look, and action; and this view will more readily inspire homage in the bosom of a person in a condition like hers, than to see the parties possessing and exercising the power of life and death. Each day brought to each of the three a new succession of pleasures. Every time they wandered through the groves, nature showed herself in some new aspect of beauty; or some new feature of the seasons, or of their passing events served to give an agreeable diversity to the lapse of their hours. They walked. They angled in the lake or the sea. They snared birds that were desired for their curious appearance, or the beauty and splendour of their plumage. They took short excursions in their boat; though the bride never entered it without a momentary, visible paleness, and exacting a promise from her husband, that he should never go far beyond the limits of the harbour. Yet she never failed to remark, that to that boat, she owed the highest enjoyments of her life. A life more peaceful than they led in these secluded shades, cannot be easily imagined. Every thing that is painful and vexing in human condition, seemed to be abstracted from their lot. The repose of nature seemed to have been communicated to their bosoms; and to leave them little to desire, or hope, beyond what they actually possessed. As their domestic enjoyments became deeper, and more tranquil, adding the sober colouring of reflection to the bliss of nature and the senses, they began to find an inexhaustible fund of amusement in Rescue, whose discipline and instruction they resumed; and who was becoming every day more companionable, as well as useful. On her Asiatic countenance and olive complexion, her varying thoughts and passions were marked with the distinctness of the human features on a mirror. As the process of abstraction and combination had just commenced in her mind under their eye, and as, hitherto, nature had been painted in her thoughts with the singleness and distinctness of vision and sense, it was delightful to watch the progress of the change from conceptions, that were paintings, to those that were formed from reasoning, and comparing what passed in her own mind with what passed without her. Her first expressions in English, beyond mere acts of memory, were expressed entirely in the language of poetry. Instead of the dreary, and terrible conceptions of the North American savage, hers were the bland, voluptuous, and splendid images of her own more delicious climate, and more favoured country. The best of her character was, that she was not only strong, shrewd, cheerful, and industrious,—but she was honest, sincere, and unbounded in her affection for them. As soon as she understood their wants, her next study was how to anticipate, and satisfy them. Before the first month after their marriage was completed, she so fully understood the duties of the kitchen, that she felt an ambition in being able to discharge them unaided and alone. He found as much amusement in instructing her in his language, and in learning her to read, as his wife did in learning her the mysteries of the kitchen and the ward robe. Her apprehension was so ready, and her application so unwearied and indefatigable, that in one month she understood them, and could make herself understood, upon all the common points of parlance, with sufficient clearness. Thus they began to realize the high satisfaction, not only of training up an excellent assistant, but a companionable and reasonable being. To them her docility, gentleness, and fidelity, soon surrounded her with pleasant associations; and she appeared not only good, but agreeable; and had they been called to describe her to a third person, they would have spoken of her as having something, which they could not well describe, of agreeable in her person and countenance. The first points of instruction, upon which he wished to exercise her reason and affections, was that first point in the order of importance—religion. The being of a God, and the relation of his creatures to Him, seemed to her a very simple and obvious idea. It was easy to make her comprehend the grandeur and the glory of Him, who had formed the impressive nature which was spread before her. But, when he thence proceeded to less obvious points of religious faith and hope, he began to realize the usual difficulties that all catechists, who have undertaken to teach people, possessed of no other than simple ideas, partially understanding, and understood, have experienced. One question involved another, and led to points, on which it was impossible to give her satisfactory explanations. When he told her, that it was her duty to believe in God, to love and trust Him, “Me stand that well,” she said, readily. But when he advanced to more abstract articles of the christian faith, the poor savagess would shake her head, and her countenance would become overcast with gloom. But they remarked the visible and striking influence of example. She comprehended, with astonishing readiness, the nobler actions that sprung from forbearance or sacrifice, or benevolence, or love; and from those various and exalted motives, that produce in disciplined and virtuous minds, an order of acting so different from that which she had been accustomed to contemplate. Whenever she witnessed such an act, and comprehended its motive, her eye glistened, and the thrill of virtuous enthusiasm evidently pervaded her frame; she clasped her hands, and looked upwards, “Me wish me good. Me pray God, make me good.” Such was the simple and earnest prayer of this honest and affectionate creature. She evidently loved her master, and looked up to him with a confidence and affection, bordering on veneration. She never forgot his manner of delivering her from death. He was her guide and her example in every thing; and it was happy for both, that the first use which she made of her powers in speaking English, was in those continued eulogies on her master, which fall so pleasantly on the ears of a wife, who is wholly devoted to her husband. In regard to her religious instruction, he finally settled upon the conviction, that minds like hers, and in her stage of knowledge, can receive no other than an implicit faith on the confidence reposed in the superior wisdom and sanctity of the teacher. Therefore, he taught her in a solemn and firm tone of voice certain doctrines, neither to be doubted, nor questioned, but to be received implicitly, as having been declared by God himself. Here his instruction ended, and his wife took it up where he laid it down; and with the affection and tenderness of a mother, this young and beautiful woman stood over the docile savage, on her bended knees, repeating the Lord's prayer, the apostle's creed, “Now I lay me,” &amp;c. and some of the simple and beautiful hymns of the Episcopal service. In little more than two months she was able so far to explain herself in English, as to make the passages of her brief history well and distinctly understood. It was clear from her communications, that she belonged to that island, and that her heart was deeply impressed with all the tender instincts of home. She had a father and mother, and a brother, but no sister. When she spake of them, the fountains of deep feeling within were stirred as deeply, as if she had been raised in the bosom of society. The tears flowed, and grief for a while suspended the utterance of her words. They gathered from her, that the inhabitants of this island were engaged in continual hostilities with those of an adjacent and much larger island, too remote to be seen from the mountains. On the opposite side of these mountains she was born. The hostile savages had made a descent upon her people. The women had fought with the men. Their enemies gained the victory. Most of her people escaped to the mountains. A few prisoners, among whom was Rescue, were taken. These people were cannibals, and had eaten two of the prisoners, and her master had delivered her from the same fate, as has been related. The victors had coursed round the island by sea in their proas; and Rescue, with the vague notions of relative distances common to savages, imagined the place of her residence at an immense distance. She had evidently been brought to their side of the island because it was uninhabited, and because the victors had been accustomed to come there, and celebrate their horrid orgies unmolested. Her notions of distance were confused, in consequence of having been carried to the enemy's country, before she had been brought to their side of the island. It is true, she described that she lived in view of mountains that threw up fire and smoke; but she seemed to have no idea, that they were the same which were visible from the grotto. The different VOL. II.—2 aspect of the mountains on her native side of the island, effectually shielded her simple mind from the conviction of their identity. They, of course, concealed these circumstances from her; for they saw such a strong current of feeling and tenderness in her thoughts and affections; such earnest and indelible remembrances, as, they feared, would induce her to escape, and fly over the mountains, if she were once aware of the little distance which interposed between them and her country. Uncommon quickness of apprehension, and great amiability of character, endeared her to her deliverers. She was aid, and society, and amusement; and her instruction and training were delightful occupations to them. Her loss would have been considered a great affliction and privation. They afterwards had the most ample opportunities to test the strength of her gratitude and affection, and to feel rebuked for their want of confidence in her. In these annals are recorded their journal of daily events, which to some would have an absorbing interest; and some would consider it insupportably tedious and monotonous. It was that calm, tranquil existence, in the midst of a delicious climate, abundance, and gratified affection, where, to the parties, events in themselves unimportant, have an interest of a character so peculiar as to vanish in the description. There were the customary alternations of delightful days and of lowering skies, and rainy periods, and tempests. Some of their animals showed the ingratitude to escape; others died. Though their projects generally prospered, others went wrong. Though the tie between the husband and wife was that of the purest love, yet it does not appear that they were always alike affectionate, or alike happy. There were sometimes slight storms in their moral, as well as their natural sky. They found no difficulty in obtaining an ample supply of food; but the birds and animals of the island soon learned to consider them as enemies, and to avoid them enough to give the pursuit of taking them the zest of difficulty. For easy and ample supplies of vegetables, a garden became necessary. It would also be a source of amusement to cultivate one; and it would be an appropriate ornament to the beautiful view in front of their terrace. Seeds of all sorts had been saved from the wreck of the Australasia. A charming slope was enclosed; and a garden in that delightful climate and fertile soil only needed the sowing of the seeds, and the keeping down of the weeds. The most splendid shrubs, plants, and flowers, soon graced this favoured spot. To tend it, and beautify it, and form walks, and shades, and bowers, was one of those primitive and delightful pursuits, which proves that it is a natural enjoyment, by filling the heart with constant and healthful excitement, that always pleases, and never cloys. Rescue clearly loved her master more than any thing else in the world; though her unbounded affection showed none of the aspects of partaking, in any degree, of that peculiar affection, that can only exist between the different sexes. It seemed to be all gratitude, confidence, unbounded veneration, and entire reliance upon him, as surpassing in strength, wisdom and goodness. Her ardent manifestation of these feelings was at first the source of feelings of rather an unpleasant character to her mistress. But she soon learned to understand her, and do her entire justice. Next to her pride and affection for her husband, was her fondness for Rescue. In her eye the olive complexion of Rescue, and her keen lustrous black eye, was beauty; and her erect and gigantic height the perfection of the female form. Her own original propensities and habits, that had been suspended, but not subdued by circumstances, were exemplified in the delight which she took to dress and ornament Rescue, who, on her part, showed her possession of a female heart, by a devotion to dress and ornament, as absolute as that of her mistress. Nothing rendered Rescue and her mistress happier, or put them in better temper for the day, than to have her master casually remark upon the taste of her mistress in her dress, and her fine appearance. Indeed, he soon learned to pay that small tax to good humour and good feeling with pleasure, whether he really thought Rescue particularly captivating in her new garb, or not. On her part, Rescue appeared to feel no subject of chagrin so acutely, as that she was not of the complexion of her master and mistress. When the labours and pleasures of the day had ceased abroad, and they were enjoying the bland and aromatic evening breeze in front of their grotto, the tears sometimes fell from the eyes of Rescue, as she handled the fair and glossy locks of her mistress, and looked mournfully in her lovely face. “Oh!” she said, “God make you handsome;” and pointing to her master, “He good; but poor Rescue bad, silly, black.” Tender assurances of the regard and affection of both reassured her, and drew from her the most affecting demonstrations of love, and gratitude, and confidence. Though she expressed herself easily in English, it was with a peculiar and amusing accent, and an arch consciousness of the difference of her way of speaking from theirs, which gave her conversation the zest of constant interest. Her ways of conceiving of things were so novel, and so different from theirs, that the development of her mind under their instruction was a study to them. She made easy and rapid progress in learning to read; when her mind had expanded sufficiently to comprehend the nature and bearing of this acquirement, it seemed to increase her admiration of the powers of the race, who had invented an art so astonishing to the mind of a savage, as to make characters on paper speak to the understanding and heart, almost to the point of adoration. 2* Rescue began early to manifest no small degree of penetration in discerning motive, and discovering the lay of the land. When her duties placed her alone with her master, her conversation generally turned upon the beauty of her mistress; and when with her, upon the goodness and wisdom of her master, or his peculiar ways of showing unconscious affection for his mistress; and she had an exceeding shrewdness of interpretation, which could give the most common looks and actions a plausive aspect of love. Whenever the young and sly savagess had been so fortunate as to gain the particular good will of her mistress in this way, she was sure, by way of compensation, to come forth the next holiday morning—for they had their days of labour and their holidays—robed and looped in one of the new ornamented, new moulded, and cast gowns of her mistress. Like the shades of the departed in the faith of the Pythagoreans, the dresses of the mistress regularly returned to earth, in a new form, on the tall and powerful frame of Rescue. The awkward delight, and the complacent consciousness of vanity, manifested by a kind of ludicrous, tragicomic gait of the buskin, however ridiculous to the master, seemed all easy, natural, and graceful to the mistress. Many were the long hours that the mistress and the maid peaceably and happily occupied all their thoughts in these important arrangements for the transmigration of gowns and dresses. Rescue learned still more readily to decide touching becoming forms, and colours, and patterns, than to read and write. Nor did her mistress ever adopt or new model a dress for herself, without showing Rescue the engravings in the magazine of fashion, and taking her judgment in reference to the most tasteful and beautiful among the varieties of costume and figure that these engravings presented. The master sometimes was internally grieved to find the interest of these important occupations constantly growing to such a degree, as to make alarming inroads upon the pleasures of his intercourse with his wife. When these grave matters were in discussion, he soon perceived that he played the wise and the amiable to very little purpose; and that even his best conversations fell upon the ear of his wife as interruptions. Rescue always had a keen eye to the importance of this point, and to perceive that if she stood well with the mistress, she need have no fear of being well with the master. To him the extravagant terms of commendation in which Rescue praised the dress and personal beauty of her mistress seemed affected and overstrained. But when he so expressed himself in private to his wife, she still saw, in this extravagance, no more than the amiable enthusiasm of a simple character, and an affectionate nature. But, probably, casting their joys and sorrows into a sum, it falls to the lot of few mortals to be happier than was this family. Contrary to all that he had heard said or sung upon the subject, and contrary even to his own expectations, coloured as they were by love, his affection for his wife became more intense after marriage than before. Her beauty grew on his imagination. Deportment which before their union had clearly seemed to him to be dictated by caprice, now only had the spice and the zest of variety. He began to have very clear and distinct perceptions upon the subject of the origin of the different forms of government. He learned to trace despotism and chains to other causes than had generally been assigned by legislators and political writers. He saw and felt the mystery of a government kept up without guards or heralds, or visible symbols of power, which held in a durance so pleasant, that he even wished not to shake off his chains. They, perhaps, conversed upon some point of taste or opinion, or discussed some project for adoption or rejection. It was often his misfortune to think differently from his wife. Her argument was always, or at least for the most part, maintained in smiles, gently, and without pressing it to extremes. He generally found himself, after sleeping in deliberation, the next day in sentiment with his wife. He would scarcely have remembered that he had ever entertained another opinion, or meditated another purpose, had not a certain knowing smile of his wife, and the remark, “My love, you thought differently yesterday,” reminded him that she considered him a good and an obedient subject. Indeed, if he felt any standing cause for regret, it was, to observe that his wife, whom he wished always to contemplate as an angel in intellect and heart, as she was in person, had brought to those solitudes no small share of the tastes and habits which she had fostered in other days, and another order of things. It was not so much, that the extreme and minute attention which she paid to her dress and daily appearance occupied so great a portion of her time, as to deprive him of much of her society, though he painfully felt this privation, as it was, that he could not endure to think, that a woman so lovely should show such a want of conformity to circumstances, and keeping, and intellectual taste, as to bring to that solitude propensities which were only excusable where every thing about her was calculated, not only to inspire those tastes, but to keep her in countenance in indulging them. Had he been in society, indeed, he would not have allowed another to embody in words his own feelings in this case. He always ended these views by concluding, that the most intelligent and self-disciplined woman, as well as the most beautiful, had fallen to his share. Never, probably, had mutual affection been more constant and intense; and yet the painful fact must stand recorded on these annals, that the thermometer of connubial affection had sensible variations. For the most part, the range was so slight, as to afford a variety not very unpleasant. Once or twice the sky was actually overcast, and a real storm ensued. A narrative of the causes and results is noted here, only that others, who are sailing down the stream of matrimonial life, may derive warning from their case. These storms grew from a speck in the sky, not larger than the prophet's harbinger. The origin and history of the first was as follows. The weather had been peculiarly delightful. For some days he had felt himself afflicted with something of that feeling of loneliness, dissatisfaction with himself, and ennui, which inspired him with a want, most sensibly felt, of the society of his wife. A feeling, the direct reverse, seemed at the same time to have possession of her. For many days in succession, when he waited for her to go abroad with him, and cheer his loneliness amidst the verdure of the groves, she and Rescue were closeted, and had evidently been laying their heads together in conclave. Mysterious whispers and looks were interchanged between them; and while he was pining with the want of her companionship in his walks, his sailing, or angling, she appeared all at once to have found enjoyments which were more than a compensation for the society of her husband. In a tone, perhaps, more like complaint than he ought to have adopted, he asked her when he should once more have the only enjoyment that he could possess, the pleasure of her society. With a grave air, she answered, “All in good time, Arthur, you shall know.” On the following Sabbath morning the cabinet mystery was explained. His wife met him at breakfast, in a splendid new dress, which, she told him with great complacency, was a fashionable morning dress. The gigantic Rescue, too, was dizened as fine as a peacock. With a countenance, in which the triumph of beauty and dress visibly predominated over the effort to seem composed and indifferent, she asked him what he thought of her dress. In his delight at regaining her society in his accustomed morning walk, and entirely satisfied, as he was, with her appearance in any dress; perhaps, too, thinking of something else at the moment, or not aware of the importance attached to the reply, and, it may be, inly displeased that preparing this dress had deprived him of so much of his wife's society; he answered carelessly, that he thought it might have been a becoming dress in London; but he now deemed, that a dress more flowing, rural, and easy, gave her a better appearance here. Her arm, which had been folded within his, dropped. The tears started into her eyes, and murmuring something about the misfortune of want of taste, she left him, and took the arm of Rescue, almost as fine as herself. The strongly marked olive face of her maid, caught the expression of the mistress; and, for the first time, her sad and reproachful countenance charged her master with cruelty and outrage. Farewell, for that day, to verdure, and fragrance, and flowers, and communion of the heart; and the satisfied declarations, “How happy we have been this day!” with which their evenings used to close. He could hardly forbear thinking that even the pigeons and hares took part with hiswife in her discontent. The disappointment was the more bitter from the circumstance, that his heart had beat high with the contrast of the pleasure expected in this walk. However, they had plenty of that solemn silence, that is supposed to be so favourable to the proper meditations of the Sabbath. This brown study, and this meditative silence lasted four days, though it seemed to be not less painful to the wife than the husband. On the fifth day she appeared in her charming, flowing, and graceful white shepherdess dress. Her beautiful tresses flowed naturally, and her countenance beamed with forgiveness and benignity. The happy husband's heart danced in raptures; but discretion interdicted him from availing himself of terms of praise too strongly marked. He was aware that it would involve unpleasant recollections. The next day he ventured to praise the good taste of her dress, and the fineness of her appearance in it, so heartily, liberally, and sincerely, that the sweetest expression of content and affection sat on her countenance, and she declared that she had found all the heart of her dear Arthur once more. The next storm occurred about three weeks afterwards, at dinner. A fine turtle was the dinner that day. His wife had dictated a different mode of cooking from the common. While she expatiated learnedly upon gastronomic lore, and when and where she had eaten turtle cooked in that improved way, she asked her husband how he liked it. The question came upon him before he had prepared an answer, or meditated the consequences. He replied, inadvertently, “Very well, but by no means so well as in the customary way.” This drew from her a defence of the new way more energetic than the occasion appeared to demand. He remarked coolly in reply, and still unwarned that a storm was gathering, that it might be better to more refined tastes than his; and that, though he thought it not so good as usual, it was still very agreeable, and answered well. By this time he saw the danger, and stammered something else to conceal a retreat. But it was too late; and the retreat was far enough from being the fortunate one of the ten thousand. All this expense of thought, labour, and science, had been bestowed out of a desire to his particular gratification; and his view of the thing not only evidenced bad and vulgar taste, but ingratitude. Drawing up her form in her chair, and arraying her polished forehead in its sternest aspect, she got up rather, it might seem, for Rescue's benefit than his; for she directed her speech to her, a most learned dissertation upon the manner of cooking and managing a turtle, by the scientific corps of cooks in her father's family. Then forth from their groves stalked her great ancestors, generation after generation; and the information followed, VOL. II.—3 that the best cookery had been a science of hereditary descent in her paternal halls, for centuries. She did not leave him to draw the palpable inference, that it argued as much arrogance in him to give an opinion in a matter of taste of that sort, as it did want of acquaintance with good cookery from the beginning. He replied, perhaps a little tartly, that he did not eat for her ancestors, but himself. This settled the point, and she arose with the attitude of outraged dignity, and withdrew. These records will be wholly useless, if they do not remind the reader, that ten thousand matrimonial broils, which have embittered the existence of the parties and their families; have originated from causes as trifling as these. They prove, too, that even in this abode, where there were but three persons, two at least were not immaculate; but that beings generally so affectionate and happy, were sometimes a little ruffled, like the rest. Probably, at the moment of her excitement, had a third person intervened, and said a harsh thing in confirmation of her feelings against her husband, she would have turned upon the third person, and bestowed upon him all the temper and bitterness that had been originally directed towards the former. He discovered, too, that these storms, however appalling while they were passing by, had the same effect upon the moral atmosphere of the dwelling, that the terrible tropical storm had upon the physical sky; that is to say, to purify the air, and produce a more healthful and delightful temperature afterwards. The sky that followed, was delightful. After the storm had wholly blown by, there was such kind, and earnest, though silent and unnamed efforts to atone for the past, by triple demonstrations of love and kindness, that he sometimes asked himself, if a few stormy days were not worth the enduring, in order to procure the delightful weather that followed. In fact, he more than once repeated to himself the old Latin saw in his grammar, which, rendered into English, imports, that “the quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love.” When the simplicity and entireness of their affection returned, how often did they declare to each other, that if forewarned that sickness or calamity must have befallen the one or the other, each would have chosen it, in their own person, rather than for the other. Each declared, not in words only, but in look, manner, and action, that in each other they possessed all the world. They found the climate not only pleasant, but salubrious. Their food was abundant, and all their wants were satisfied with such a moderate share of labour, as was only enough to mark the hours of relaxation with pleasure. They had a strong, kind, and faithful servant, whose gaiety, good sense, and originality, were an unfailing source of amusement. For beauty and freshness of landscape, the scenery which surrounded them was as that of Eden. They had all that nature and love could supply. All this notwithstanding, they were obliged to confess to each other, that they wanted society. It would be a hopeless effort to define all the circumstances that concurred to create this want. They were obliged, amidst the solitary enjoyment of their groves, to admit how much men depend upon the common charities, decencies, small comforts, and almost invisibilities, and the influence of almost imperceptible relations, for a considerable portion of the sum of human enjoyment. Let no one underrate the advantages of society, nor affect to decry or undervalue that in which he dwells, and where Providence has cast his lot. No position scarcely can be imagined in existence, where the happiness of man does not depend more on moral causes and relations, than physical enjoyment. Another circumstance, to which both looked forward with a tenderness and anxiety which can be only imagined in a situation like theirs, came in to increase their sense of the want of the comforts and the protection of society. When they were discussing this subject one evening, and the chances whether her father yet lived, and, if living, the manner in which he would probably receive them, a fine large ship hove in sight, with her sails all spread to the breeze, and steering across the southern verge of their horizon. What a sight to these three isolated beings! They could easily imagine the life, bustle, and gaiety of that floating city, and the people on board, so little aware of these solitary persons so near them. They fired their swivel and their small arms. They kindled a high blaze of fire. They unfurled the flag of the Australasia. All was equally unavailing to gain her notice. She moved slowly on, like the imperceptible lapse of time, across the southern limit of their horizon, becoming first a white speck in the sky, and then wholly disappearing. Augusta, seeing her husband uncommonly gloomy in view of the disappointment, embraced him with tears of undissembled affection, declaring, that but for one circumstance, she should prefer to renounce society for ever. Eleven months from the time of their marriage, his wife presented him with a beautiful Australasian daughter; the perfect pattern of Augusta, as he thought; and the literal transcript of him, as she said. Who will venture to describe the anxiety of the husband while this event was pending? Who will describe the agony with which he walked the grotto, while it was in question, whether his dear wife should become a mother for the first time, or he left doubly desolate and alone, by the prostration of all his hopes, as a husband and a father? Happily 3* the penalty of Eve is paid with ease in the bland climates of the tropics. The apprehensions and the anxieties of the father, and the tranquil joys which none but a mother, on such occasions, can know, constituted this hour of jubilee and rejoicing a new era in the history of the grotto. Rescue, tall as she was before, became more majestic, and larger than life, on this occasion. She seemed intuitively to comprehend all the official honours, and dignities, and immunities, which the attending lady, on like occasions, has a right to assume. There seemed to be danger that she would devour the feeble little stranger with kisses. When she handed it, according to prescribed ceremony, in its first dress, to the father, it was done with an air as if she had much more sacred rights to it than the father himself. But if Augusta was beautiful and beloved before, what was she now, in the interesting paleness of maternity, and holding the cherished babe to her bosom, to unlock for its nourishment, the fountains of life? Oh! it is then only, that they who are happily united, know all the mysterious tenderness and sanctity of the connubial tie. There was now a new, a tender, and endless theme for conversation. How could this dear babe be reared and educated in this desolate island? Such is human nature. Scarcely have we gratified the first and highest wish of the human heart, before a new one discloses itself. Augusta had a suitable respect for the intellectual powers and scholarship of her husband; but the babe was not yet two days old, before she had started the inquiry, how it was to be trained and educated. “Well as you are qualified, my love,” she would say, “to instruct our daughter in the solid branches of education, there is much which the little angel could never learn, except in society. How could she catch the early graces of motion, deportment, dancing, music, the million nameless graces and forms of society, except by the tact of those who learn them in the highest circles of polished life?” He smiled, and asked in reply, where would be the use of all this, if she were to have no spectators or admirers, except kangaroos and parrots; and have her beauty and accomplishments develope and waste their sweetness on the desert air? “Now, my dear Arthur,” she answered, “that is not like you. Is she not the sweetest babe that was ever seen? Would we not wish her as accomplished as she is beautiful, if no other eyes than our own were to behold her?” These dialogues generally terminated by the endurance by the poor little thing, that was the subject of these premature disputes, of a most annoying amount of kisses from father and mother; then to pass into the tender, but brawny arms of Rescue. Never was namby pamby like that of this affectionate Australasian. It would make no mean figure beside the birth day ode of the emperor of Timbuctoo. In a few days, Augusta was as well as before; though there was an almost imperceptible languor, that rendered her loveliness to him more touching than ever. Her eyes, movements, and countenance, all told that her heart was full. To the powerful Rescue, half a dozen such babes would only have been a plaything burden. During their walks she was generally the bearer of this lovely charge. Her attachment soon became such to it, that she showed reluctance to relinquish it, even to the father and mother. With this little smiling thing in her arms, and the companion of their walks, the hours of their existence flowed on, apparently in a deeper and more mellow satisfaction than ever. Every conversation placed the privation of society, and of having no place in which to rear this dear and cherished babe amidst its advantages, in a stronger point of light. They consulted Rescue touching the chances of leaving the island by the help of her people. Her eye kindled at the thought of seeing her parents and her native home again. She seemed to entertain no doubt, that they who had been kind to her, and who had saved her from her enemies, would not fail to be kindly received by her people. They continued to glean information from her upon this subject in many conversations; and so eagerly did she enter into the project of going on a journey to visit her people, that they began once more to do her the injustice to fear that she would attempt to escape from them. They observed her, one evening, on their return from a walk, looking gloomily at the blue summits of the mountains above them. They asked her, why she looked so intensely in that direction. She answered, with tears streaming down her cheeks, “Me tink me see that big hill long time go. Me go round, round, round. Me come back. Me sure me see that hill fore now.” “Well, then,” said her master, “if you were sure that by going over those mountains you could get home, you would go away and leave us!” She answered, with mixed sorrow and indignation, “You no stand me. Me love father, love mother. Me love massa and little missee and big missee more than all the world.” This conversation led to a series of questions, in her answers to which, it appeared, that the faithful creature loved them better than any thing in the world; but, that next to her love of them, was her unquenchable affection for her parents, her home, and her country. As has been remarked, she represented her people as constantly engaged in hostilities with the inhabitants of a neighbouring island; which she had heard her people say, was so great, as to have no end, that is to say, they inferred that it was a continent; probably the continent of New Holland. She described the enemies of her people as being cannibals; and her people as being comparatively mild. When questioned continually and closely upon the subject, she seemed to remember many things which had not occurred to her memory in her first vague conversations upon the subject. She had imperfect recollections that she had heard among her people, that they knew where white people dwelt, and had been to see and trade with them. The final impression from all these conversations was, that Rescue's people were gentle and affectionate in their character and manners; and that some of the British establishments in these seas could not be very distant. Then ensued long and tender discussions of the comparative chances of happiness in society, and in the abundance and repose of that charming solitude. Sometimes at the close of the discussion, one scale preponderated and sometimes the other. In the melancholy supposition of the death of her father without a will, Augusta would be the sole heiress of his immense wealth. But if he lived, as her husband thought probable, and they should find him at New Holland, in the event of their sailing there, through the aid of Rescue's people, how would her proud and aristocratic father receive her in her present condition? Augusta always terminated these discussions in one way. She was sure that when her father saw her husband and her dear babe, he could not but relent. “He will surely acknowledge us,” she said: “suppose even the worst, and that he should not,”—“Why then,” he replied, “most probably, Augusta, you would leave your husband and return to your father.” She turned upon him a look of such affectionate reproach, while the tears started in her eyes, as left him no wish ever to repeat that charge. “I hope,” she replied, “my dear Arthur, you do not judge my heart by your own.” In fact, this babe seemed to impose an insurmountable obligation upon both, to encounter any chances, in order to place it in reach of the advantages of society. If Augusta's father lived, and would receive them, they promised to share each others prosperity. If he refused to receive them, they still promised never to forsake each other, come what changes or chances might. They finally came to the determination, as the result of their deliberations and convictions, to scale the mountains, and to send Rescue in advance of them, among her own people; and ascertain by her, how the people would receive them. If these people should be reported by Rescue, as willing to receive them kindly, they hoped to be able to induce them to undertake a voyage to the white settlements. They were assured that if any such existed in that vicinity, they must be those of Port Jackson, Sidney Cove, or some of the incipient settlements in New Holland. Having taken their resolutions, the preparations were few and easy; consisting only in laying out their plan, and carrying with them food enough to last over the mountains. Rescue assured them, that bread-fruit and fish were abundant in her country. Every thing that was necessary and that would not much encumber them was selected. As on their former attempt at a voyage, they proposed to leave every thing in a situation that they might return to it again, if they failed in obtaining a kind reception from the savages. If they reached New Holland, they proposed to give the proper notice, that those interested in the cargo of the Australasia, might sail to the grotto, and regain whatever of their property remained. Their determinations being fixed, the next thing was to carry them into effect as soon as possible. Each feared that the other would relax from the firmness of fixed purpose, and was anxious to undertake the expedition at once. Accordingly they prepared dried meat and fish to last them five days, and as much bread-fruit and sweet potatoes, as they could conveniently carry, and three bottles of wine. He slung part of the articles in a soldier's knapsack over his shoulders, and Rescue weighed the remainder in another over hers. In her arms she carried the dear babe. He shouldered a single musket, with the cartridge box, and his wife charged herself only with a Bible. It would be useless to attempt, because it would be impossible to give any adequate idea of the feelings of the parties, when they left this commodious, safe, and pleasant retreat, which had sheltered them more than three years. Nature, as if to soften the bitterness of the parting, had involved the earth in a thick fog. Had the morning been bright and beautiful, the last look would have been too painful, and they would have been too strongly reminded of the auspices under which they made their former attempt to leave the island. As it was, every spot, every grove, spring and copse, had been consecrated by some remembrance, either of joy or sorrow. The numerous, gay, and motley groups of domestic birds and animals gathered round Augusta, with their customary cries of recognition and welcome; nor could she forbear to drop natural tears, at the thought of leaving all these humble, irrational friends to take care for themselves, and return to the habits and the solitude of their woods. Happily, our nature is so constituted, that one strong sentiment triumphs over another. The babe smiled in the arms of Rescue, and was an object of so much more absorbing interest than all the rest, as to soften the pain of parting. VOL. II.—4 They carried with them all that ought to occupy their first affections. Grateful to the Almighty for the food, shelter, repose and contentment, that the island had yielded them; and remembering, that still the palms would be as freshly verdant, the flowers as fragrant, and the mountains as blue in the upper regions, after they should be gone as before; wishing then, that if future mariners should be wrecked upon these remote shores, they might find the same happy shelter amid these shades, and imploring the guidance and blessing of the Almighty in their new enterprise—they turned and walked slowly away. As they began to ascend the mountains the mists rolled away, and presented the same magnificent and glorious view which they had been accustomed to behold. Rescue sprang forward from cliff to cliff, with the agility of a chamois of the mountains. She still kept in advance of the father and mother, often stopping to cool the babe in the shade. The little babe, refreshed by the mountain breeze, uttered its inarticulate notes of joy, and evinced the same spirit which makes the lamb bound with that fulness of life, which it has no other way to express. They made rapid progress; and by eleven in the morning were on the table-rock, to repose there for a moment, before they lost sight of the country which had sheltered them so many years; and began to descend the opposite side of the mountains. Augusta looked down upon the landscape below, and compared this departure to the beautiful description of the leaving of paradise by our first parents. Her voice almost failed through excess of emotion. “Shall we find,” said she, “a happier country?” “At least,” replied her husband, “we are not separated exiles. We carry all our heart with us. Like the birds, we all go together. But let us not yield to a tenderness, which may soften our hearts, and unnerve us for our purposes.” After a short rest, they began to descend towards the unexplored valley. The smoking volcanos were all around them. New configurations of nature struck their eye, and new aspects of the winding shore of the sea were spread in the distance. As they were passing the last elevation, and descending the declivity, on a sudden Rescue gave the babe to its father, and began to spring and caper as usual when much elated, snapping her fingers, crying, “I see him! I see him!” Pointing to smokes, which ascended far down the vale, and the tears streaming down her cheeks. “There home! There home! There father and mother!” She continued to look with a fixed and intense gaze, and tear continued to roll behind tear, all the time they staid. It was an affecting tribute of the heart to kindred, country, and home; the most sacred and indelible instincts in every rightly constituted heart; nor could they fail to remark the truth and eloquence of the apostle, where he has said, that God hath made of one blood, all the nations that dwell on the earth. It is a new tie to bind us to our species, to realize that the human heart is every where constituted in the same way. The declivity of that side of the mountains was found much more gentle than the other; and the sun was declining, and the level of the vale was yet far below them. As the sun was pouring his flood of yellow radiance on the sea, and the trees, and the mountains, they came upon a vast over-arching rock. Dry grass was gathered in abundance. Rescue spread it, and arranged it in the form of couches; while the mother held, and nursed her babe. Blankets were spread upon the moss and grass, under the covert of the cliff. The father struck a fire with his gun, and in a few moments killed birds for their supper. A bright fire blazed. A spring welled from the declivity just by them, and fell over a rock with a pleasant and bubbling murmur. The birds sung sweetly the requiem of the parting day. They supped plentifully and luxuriously, mutually agreeing to see the future through the colouring of hope; and returning thanks to God, that he had so mercifully provided for them at the commencement of their experiment. Neither complained of fatigue. All were cheerful. Nothing of sinister omen had occurred, and no train of gloomy or disheartening ideas, was presented to their minds. It was not exactly the commodious and sumptuous place which the grotto was; but it was clean, dry, and comfortable. The babe lay on the bosom of the mother, and the three slept through the night the profound sleep of confidence and innocence. With the first light of the morning, Rescue prepared their breakfast, and they resumed their descent. They now passed groves, the trees of which were loaded with bread-fruit. There were many new fruits in their way, whose qualities and flavours Rescue taught them. They traversed, alternately, beautiful little forests, and then open meadows, dotted with circular clumps of trees. Numerous limpid brooks wound round the bases of the mountains, and could be traced by their gentle brawling murmur, after they were lost in the woods. From the declivities of the mountains, the eye easily traced, as on a map, the country below, as it was, inhabited or uninhabited. They aimed to traverse the most uninhabited part of the country, if possible to avoid a meeting with the people, until they should arrive at the home of Rescue. In their course, they came upon the shore of a beautiful freshwater lake, which appeared to extend a league in circumference. It was a sheet of water, as pellucid as air, in a deep basin of basaltic rock. 4* They made a pause under the shade of a spreading palm that overhung the waters of this lake. Bread-fruit was about them. They refreshed themselves with that, and wine and water. It was a spectacle of untiring interest and delight, to look down the apparently bottomless depths of these transparent waters, and see the strange foliage, and bright verdure of the trees inverted in the crystal element; and to remark the thousands of fishes, of every form and hue, of green, scarlet, and gold; some voluptuously reposing in the sunbeams, some darting in pursuit of their prey; and countless millions of the little fry, swimming in shoals, and sporting in the visible joys of their young existence. Beyond this lake was a considerable eminence, and in approaching it, they still crossed rivulets, winding towards the lake. The moment they reached the top of this eminence, Rescue fell to capering and snapping her fingers, more vehemently than ever. The tears again rolled down her cheeks; and she was scarcely able to articulate the words, Father's house! father's house! At the same time she pointed them to a cluster of cabins, half hid among the trees, from which, however, the smoke could easily be seen, streaming aloft. They seemed distant something more than a league. They had difficulty in repressing the purpose of the affectionate creature to run forward, and show the dear babe to her parents. They stopped here in the shade, to refresh themselves, and concert their plans. With renewed strength and confidence, they then pressed on, until Rescue's paternal cabin could be distinctly seen at the distance of half a mile. They paused in the shelter of a deep thicket. He charged his musket, and arranged his means of defence; intending, in case of a hostile reception, to be some rods in advance of his wife and babe. He then gave his last directions and his parting exhortations to Rescue. He told her, that he put not only his own life, but, what was a thousand times dearer, that of his wife and babe, into her hands. If she should prove discreet, and faithful, he assured her, that she would more than repay all her obligations to them. She was charged, in the first place, to ascertain exactly what kind of reception she could promise for them; and in the next place, if there was any chance that they would carry them in their proas to the settlements of the whites. When she was favourably assured upon these points, she was to bring back with her some of the chiefs of the village. If there was the least doubt about the manner of their reception, she was to conceal the circumstance of their being in the vicinity. She was to make this fact known by a certain cry, concerted as a signal between them, and was to make her way to rejoin them as soon as she could do it without suspicion, and they were all to march back to the grotto. When they had given her these charges, and she had made her solemn affirmation to each, she was admonished, that they would naturally suffer from impatience; and she was urged to make all possible dispatch in her arrangements. She seemed, after all, reluctant to part with the babe; and earnestly entreated to be allowed to carry it with her. The father, as she gave it into the arms of its mother, charged her again, “Be prudent—be faithful—we put our lives, and this dear babe into your power; and we have entire confidence in you.” The countenance of Rescue manifested, that she felt the importance and responsibility of her mission. She kissed the babe, and, with an unexpected delicacy of tenderness, the polished forehead of the mother. She turned pale, as she passed the father, uttering, as she passed, “You save my life—I die for you too—You soon see if Rescue no good.” After this kind and faithful being disappeared from their view, considering the importance and the uncertainty of her mission, and the impossibility of making any calculations touching the issue, they must be supposed to have been in a state of suspense, as painful and as anxious as can well be imagined. Augusta was more than once disposed to upbraid herself for the folly of having inspired her husband with the purpose to commence such a hazardous and uncertain enterprise, and to lament the folly of leaving their pleasant and safe retreat on the other side the mountains. But so long as a mother can press her babe to her bosom, and can water its cheek with the tear of maternal tenderness, she is not without resource. The hour, however, that elapsed between the departure of Rescue, and their hearing the return of trampling feet through the thicket, seemed as an age to them. At length, they saw Rescue advancing, with an eager and joyful countenance, accompanied by an old savage man and woman, and a young man, whose countenance instantly proclaimed him her brother. She had been welcomed by father, and mother, and brother, as one returned from the dead; for they had seen her carried off prisoner, and knew, but too well, the fate that was reserved for her. The tears of filial love and joy were on her cheeks. She had told them what her deliverers had done for her; and had trained them to entertain the most exalted conceptions of them, and had given them so many instructions in what way to deport themselves, so as not to disgust or annoy their guests, that they approached them with an awkward embarrassment, and a respect bordering on veneration. Their holding back was obviously the result of good feelings towards them; and in their whole manner they showed them, that they had derived the most favourable impressions from Rescue, and that they wished to receive them with all possible marks of favour and kindness. Every thing showed that their interview with their daughter had been a most tender and affecting one. They often broke off their conversation with their invited guests, to run to Rescue, and renew their embraces. The amount of their speech was, to invite the strangers to their village. They promised that they would take them in their grand war proa to the settlements of the whites; to which, they affirmed, they could sail, with a fair wind, in one day. They informed, that between this island and the country of the whites, was another island, inhabited by their own people; and that between that island, and the country of the whites there was but a narrow strait. They pointed, with looks of aversion and horror, in another direction, where a green skirted shore was dimly discernible over the water, and there, they gave them to understand, was the country of their enemies. Every thing in their words and manner, tended to inspire confidence; and Rescue, who possessed quick tact and discernment upon the manners and thoughts of her people, assured her master and mistress, that entire reliance might be placed upon their proffers of aid and good will. They followed the savages, Rescue leading the way, beside her parents, with the babe in her arms. It is unnecessary to repeat the minute description which ensues in the journal, of the details of their reception among the savages. Their stay among them was too short to enable them to record more of their domestic habits and modes, than such as were obvious to the eye, in a sojourn of one night. The manners even of a savage people can be learned only by long and intimate inspection. Nothing could be more cordial than the reception which they gave their guests. When they actually arrived among them, no veneration could longer withhold them from the expression of their feelings. They yelled, danced, and shouted round them, with a frantic joy, that blanched the cheek of Augusta, and caused her to cling closely to her husband, and press her babe with the spasmodic earnestness of maternal apprehension. All this was discovered by Rescue, and it went to her heart. She was in the midst of them, endeavouring, in their own language, to assuage the ferocity of these demonstrations. But it was all in vain. The winds might as easily have been controlled. They pressed about their guests, examining their clothes, and touching their hands, to ascertain, as it seemed, the cause of the difference of complexion between them. At length, with infinite exertion, Rescue persuaded the crowd away from them. A deliberation was held among the leading men of the village, and they were informed, that, as soon as might be, they would conduct them in a proa to the neighbouring island, and would persuade the people of that island to transport them to the white settlements. A hovel was cleared, in which they were invited to pass the night; and they were promised, that on the following morning, they would carry them over to the adjacent island. They passed, as may well be supposed, a most uncomfortable night. They dared not refuse the shelter of the offered hovel, though it was small, dirty, and smoky, and every way uncomfortable, tormented with the cries of the savages through the night, and annoyed with insects and vermin. Their food, too, was prepared in the most filthy and disgusting manner; and yet, so instructed by Rescue, they seemed to eat with pleasure. To have refused the offered hospitality would have been to incur mortal enmity. The cool air of the morning refreshed them, as they once more emerged from their filthy hovel, and, preceded by a crowd of savages, advanced towards the sea-shore. Still, as they advanced, new crowds of savages gathered round them, raising the same horrid yells, and uttering the same annoying demonstrations of joy. They remarked with pleasure, that their first friends every where displayed the air of vehement and earnest protectors, and still as the people crowded round them, distressing them with the eagerness of their curiosity, crying out that they were spirits, beings of a higher order, and ought to be protected by a taboo. When they arrived at the sea-shore, there seemed to be some hesitation about furnishing them a proa and transport to the neighbouring island. Noisy and fierce debate ensued. But their first friends carried their point. They were motioned to follow the chief men of the sea-shore villages, to a large proa, or war canoe. Another was brought along side. There was a great flourish, a simultaneous yell, and a pointing of their spears and war clubs, in token of defiance, in the direction of the country occupied by their enemies. Their armour was put on board. A great number of warriors crowded in. The sails were set. Augusta was pointed to a bench, over which her husband spread a blanket. Rescue sat down on the bottom of the proa, holding the babe between her father and mother, and looking intently in the face of her mistress. She, meanwhile, it was evident from the paleness of her countenance, felt the unpleasant predicament of being surrounded by these fierce and unmanageable beings, and was painfully reminded of the auspices, under which she had commenced the former attempted voyage of VOL. II.—5 escape. The sails filled, and they flew before the breeze toward the island, distant, as it seemed, three or four leagues, and enlarging every moment, as their own island receded and diminished. In less than two hours, they entered a little harbour in the island, and landed. The island had the aspect of being far more sterile than that which they had left. It was in many places bare of all vegetation, exposing a naked surface of black volcanic rock. Here they encountered another host of yelling savages, with the same fierce and annoying curiosity. There now ensued another debate between these islanders and the people who had brought them there. Rescue interpreted the amount of their discussion. The character and wishes of their guests were explained to them. On their part, they affirmed that the white settlements were not far distant, and that they were willing to take them there for a proper compensation. This point was soon arranged and stipulated to their satisfaction. They who had brought the white strangers so far, were now to leave them to the care of these islanders. Now ensued a scene, which threatened more danger than any they had yet encountered among the savages. The parents and brother of Rescue, as well as many people of her village, were clamorous to have her return with them. The struggle, too, in her own feelings, appeared to amount almost to agony. On the one hand was her country and her parents. On the other her deliverers, who had raised her to the dignity, thoughts, and joys of a new kind of existence. She clearly inclined to following her deliverer. He, on his part, was filled with apprehension, that if the struggle in her thoughts should terminate in favour of following them, it might not only exasperate the savages to the point of breaking off the treaty, but excite them to massacre their guests. On the other, so dear had she become to her deliverer, that the idea of her leaving them was exceedingly painful. Beyond all that they could have hoped, the savages left Rescue a free choice, to make her own election. Never had they witnessed a more afflicting internal struggle. She wept, and wrung her hands, and tore her hair, and sobbed, and embraced her father, and mother, and brother, again and again, as if in agony. Never was keener distress visible upon any human countenance. It was an affecting spectacle to see the alternate preponderance of these opposite affections. Augusta finally inclined the scale, by handing her the little babe, which, terrified with the grim countenances of the surrounding savages, looked with the smile of infantine recognition in her face. She seized the little thing, kissed it, and watered its face with tears. “Me never leave you!” she exclaimed, and the point was manifestly settled. She once more embraced her parents and friends, but with more calmness and moderation than before, taking a leave of them which promised to be eternal. Soon afterwards, all her friends and the people of her village returned in their proas. Their new friends could not arrange their preparations in season to commence their voyage that day, and they were obliged to spend a night of discomfort there, under endurances not unlike those of the preceding evening, in a smoky hovel, and devoured by vermin. Again they were obliged to supply the wants of nature as they might, with food so prepared as to excite unconquerable loathing. But, instructed by Rescue, they seemed satisfied, and assumed as much appearance of eating with appetite as they could. When they resumed their voyage the next morning, the grief of Rescue was renewed. She now felt, that she was leaving her own people in good earnest, and for ever. But if a momentary purpose of relenting and returning to her own place passed over her mind, it was but the purpose of a moment. She wept, and tore her hair, and held out her arms towards the island of her birth, now only dimly visible in the distance. She uttered her own farewell, in the energetic phrase of her own country; took the babe in her arms, and entered the proa, which waited for them, and in a moment they were embarked again. The wind was fair. The proa sailed swiftly. The savages seemed to be perfectly tranquil in the expectation of the issue of the voyage. No unpleasant incident occurred to excite even apprehension. By mid-day the proa rounded a projecting headland, and to the astonishment and inexpressible satisfaction of the parties, two or three small vessels with their sails all spread, were seen making towards a harbour. The savages raised their yell of joy. The husband and wife kissed their babe, and experienced sensations in view of these palpable marks of approach towards their own people, that no words could adequately express. “There,” said the husband, “are the vessels of your country—but how, Augusta, shall we be received?” “My dear Arthur,” she replied, “let us not in this joyful moment, manifest such ingratitude to the Almighty, as to distrust his merciful protection for the future. While I can look on my husband, and my babe, nothing beside shall disturb me.” It was to no purpose that they strove to persuade the savages to carry them directly to the town. Though they were at peace with the whites, they seemed apprehensive and shy, and not at all disposed to come in direct contact with them. They turned their proa to a point, and landed. The stipulated compensation, consisting of a musket, and divers other articles, which 5* they had brought from the grotto, was paid. Their friends seemed entirely satisfied, and manifested more feeling at parting from them than could have been expected from beings of their appearance. Here, then, were the three forlorn beings, who had so long been banished from social nature, left alone on a rocky point, in full view of a considerable town, which appeared in the distance, arising among the tall dead trees. Now, that the great crisis of meeting her own race again was at hand, Augusta evidenced what she suffered from the conflicting thoughts and views that pressed on her. Her countenance was alternately flushed, and pale as death. She was soon to learn, whether she was an orphan; or if her father lived, whether a man so rich and aristocratic, would receive her as the wife of a poor and obscure American. The contrast between her present condition, a wife and a mother under such circumstances; with her former lot, a beautiful heiress, the pride of her circle, and the chief object of admiration, could not but press heavily upon her thoughts. The extinguished pride, jealousies, hopes and fears of society, and of other years, so long dormant in the repose of the grotto, again arose to her own astonishment and dismay, in her bosom. She began anxiously to examine her person and dress, and that of her husband; and to question Rescue about her appearance. Happily for her under such circumstances, the master passion of maternal affection prevailed in her bosom. She kissed and nursed her babe, and as the feeble thing fell asleep on her bosom, these stormy apprehensions gradually subsided. They consulted together a few moments, and took up their march for the town. At the distance of half a mile, she and Rescue stopped under a shady tree, and her husband went forward to announce their arrival, and secure a reception and lodgings for them. They mutually inculcated calmness and philosophy; though it must be admitted, that the harrowing excitement in the countenance of his wife, was but a poor preparative for imparting the necessary firmness required on this emergency. He found a much more prompt panoply, in summoning to his aid that kind of desperation, with which a soldier on a forlorn hope, repairs to the deadly breach to enter a city by storm. In a lane leading to the harbour, he met a plain, respectable looking man, and making an effort upon his palpitating heart, he addressed him. But he perceived in a moment that his excitement and agitation within were not only painted upon his countenance, but impressed upon his tones and his voice. The man paused, and surveyed him from head to foot, without a reply. Making another effort, he asked, “What town is this, sir?” “Sidney Cove, sir,” was the reply. “I would not have thought,” he continued, “to have met any person here, speaking English, who would have needed to be told the name of this town.” Immediately he explained to the stranger the causes of his ignorance, and the circumstances of his case, inquiring, with an anxiety that can only be imagined, if Mr. Wellman were still living. Astonishment was marked in the manner of the stranger. He answered, that it was probable Mr. Wellman still lived, though no longer in New Holland; that two years since, upon the revolt of the soldiery, and the breaking out of the troubles in the country, he had become dissatisfied with it, and had returned to England. He well remembered the circumstances of the Australasia's shipwreck. Mr. Wellman escaped, with ten others, in the long boat, to an island, near which the ship was wrecked. He was afterwards conducted to this place by savages. His only daughter perished in the shipwreck. He was at first pleased with the country; but the commencement of the troubles, and chagrin on account of the loss of his daughter, conspired to disgust him, and two years since he had embarked for England. Such was the intelligence imparted by this stranger. He made a few additional inquiries touching the state of affairs in the country, and heard the advice of the stranger, in regard to the proper lodgings for him and his wife in the town. With this intelligence he returned to his wife. So dark and gloomy had been her imaginings, and so different a picture had her thoughts coloured during this distressing period of suspense, that the real state of the case struck her with delighted surprise. It is true, they were destitute, pennyless, and, they learned from this information, wholly friendless. But then, they assured themselves that there could be no people, especially no English people, so inhospitable as not to afford an asylum to destitute strangers in their condition. Assured that her father still lived, and delivered from the terror of an immediate meeting with him in her present condition, she became not only composed, but cheerful and gay. A temperament naturally buoyant gave the future such an aspect in anticipation as she wished to behold. She assured her husband, that she had no doubt but upon the strength of her father's name, they might obtain money enough to answer the immediate necessities of their condition. She considered herself as happily restored to society; and as ordinarily happens in such cases, her confidence and joy were infused into the bosom of her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit from the unworthy takes.” When they arrived in the town, the novelty of their appearance and their story soon drew about them all the idle babbling people that are usually found in such a place. Their curiosity was still more annoying than that of the savages. They had to repeat their story a hundred times. At first there was a show of much sympathy, and they received a great number of invitations to partake of the hospitality of various considerable citizens. They were gazed at as lions. They ascertained that a thousand different editions of their story went abroad. Most of the people entertained precisely the same apprehensions with Mr. Clenning, touching the reception he would probably receive from the father of his wife. Almost every one repeated that it was a shame that such people should not be supplied with money, whether the loaners ever recovered it from Mr. Wellman or not. The profligate drew hopes from the extreme beauty and destitute condition of his wife. The excitement and sympathy thus manifested soon passed away, and left the inhabitants to the natural callousness and hardness of heart, and avarice, that are generally prevalent in a new place, with a character like that of Sidney Cove. They soon found the generous professions, that were so frankly made to them on their arrival, vanishing into thin air; and they would actually have come from the abundance of their solitary island to want bread in the midst of their own people, had not one man of real generosity and sympathy appeared, who, moved by hearing their case, unsought and unsolicited, came forward, and offered them the loan of one thousand dollars, to be repaid by Mr. Wellman, when they should arrive in England. Augusta had spent two days in tears, and in apprehensions that admit of no description, amidst the cold and grim looks of the people of the place where they had taken temporary board. They did not explain all their straits to Rescue; but her intuitive sagacity partly comprehended the case; and she began a kind of rude pastoral ditty, so often repeated afterwards, about the comfort of their green island, and the meanness and hardness of heart manifested by what she phrased the bad white peoples. With this opportune offering of benevolence, Mr. Clenning hastened home to his disconsolate wife and faithful servant. “Courage,” said he, “my dear Augusta. God and man have not yet forsaken us.” Their bill was paid. Their landlady became meanly submissive and annoying in her officiousness. Better apartments were taken, and these people of such strange fortunes were at once enjoying themselves in society. Nothing in their new condition furnished them with more amusement than the wonder and curiosity of Rescue, in a region, which was, of course, all a land of unexplored wonders. Sidney Cove was a new and thriving place. Living was very expensive, and there was no such feeling as confidence between man and man. Nothing struck her with more surprise than the folly of making subsistence, and every thing, depend upon the possession of such little round pieces of metal as dollars; which, she affirmed, were of no manner of use, except to furnish playthings to the little Augusta. The utility and value of money were things altogether beyond her apprehension. The hardened and insensible character inspired by avarice, impressed her with settled and unutterable dislike. Her thoughts were incessantly occupied in unfavourable comparisons between the hard modes of subsistence there, and the exuberance of the pleasant island they had left. Nevertheless, when a vessel about that time sailed for the island, to bring away the remains of the wreck of the Australasia, left at the grotto, and she was offered a passage back there, she utterly refused, unless her master and mistress would accompany her. As soon as she found how indispensable was money to subsistence, with her own peculiar goodness of heart and docility of character, she immediately put herself in earnest to learn the duties of her new position; and her master was at once astonished and affected to learn, that during the period that intervened before they had obtained the loan of money, she had hired herself in the intervals of labour and nursing at home, to attempt to gain some of those dollars that she found so necessary to subsistence. Mr. Clenning and his wife were soon modestly, but respectably, provided with all that was necessary for propriety of appearance, conformable to their uncertain expectations. He had much feared the effect of the return to society upon the tastes and wishes of his wife. It gave him inexpressible satisfaction, to observe that she was considerate; and in all her arrangements, rather looked to their present means, than to the inclinations inspired by her former condition. “Now,” said he, as he made this discovery, “Augusta, you have done that in society, which I had thought impossible: you have inspired me with increasing love and admiration, in discovering that you are as considerate and wise, as you were always lovely.” The beauty and expectations of his wife gave them an easy and immediate introduction to the VOL. II.—6 best society in that place and vicinity. They found the new and strange arrangements of society, the country itself, and its natural productions still more whimsical and striking, than they had expected to find it. In the island which they had left, they had seen but few things out of the common analogies of nature except the structure of the kangaroo, and the singular plumage and form of some of the larger birds. Here every thing was out of any nature that they had ever yet contemplated; and the dame seemed to have wrought in her wildest frolics. Most of the trees were nearly branchless like masts, and as hard, and almost as heavy, as iron. The kind of trees most precious and valuable in other countries, as useful for the most beautiful cabinet work, were here annoying from their abundance; while trees of common use for timber were scarce. Here were birds without wings or feathers, of the size of a deer, and covered with hair instead of plumage. Here were four footed beasts, with the beaks of birds, black swans, and white eagles; ferns, nettles, and weeds growing to the size of trees; rivers, whose sources were in the sea, and their outlets in the interior swamps; here were moles that laid eggs, wooden pears, and cherries with the stones upon the outside of the cherry. In fact, to describe all the amusing vagaries of nature here, would have been to describe almost every natural, animal, and vegetable production in the country. The character of the people was, if possible, a thousand times more outré and whimsical than the aspect of physical and animal nature. Here women and children so beautiful, that in other countries they would have been objects of general admiration, were so common as no longer to excite interest or surprise. Most of the former had been prostitutes, and the latter illegitimate. They were regularly introduced, first to the assemblies of the immaculates; for here the grades of society are obliged to be marked by the most palpable distinctions, and separated by the most inaccessible barriers. The high birth and former standing of Augusta, gave her husband a reflected lustre; and they received every desirable attention from all classes of society. Her appearance and manners won her unbounded admiration. It was plain to perceive, that this order of things strongly tended to awaken habits and feelings, which had been extinct for years; and which her husband fondly hoped had been radically extirpated. But the moment it came to her ear, which it shortly did, that she was considered as having sacrificed herself in being united to her husband, and that she was the object of improper hopes and pursuit by some of the profligate adventurers there; that they supposed they might find advantages in her estimation, on account of their birth and bearing, in comparison of her husband; from that moment the disgust of a naturally virtuous and innocent mind, produced a recoil of horror and disgust, in reference to the society, and an earnest disposition to fly from the country for England. The comments that would be naturally made by the dissipated and licentious, upon the manner in which the courtship and marriage of Augusta with her husband, had been conducted, induced both to desire, that their marriage should be there solemnized anew with the rites of religion. Accordingly they were married in the church at Sidney Cove, with all the rites and ceremonies of the Episcopal church. Augusta pronounced her second vows, in presence of a crowd of spectators, apparently with as much alacrity, steadiness, and affection, as her first. When the ceremony was over, and in their retirement they embraced their dear babe, they felt how much the mind depends on the associations of publicity, solemnity, and the force of divine and human ties, sanctioned by public opinion in making up its estimates of things. Never had either embraced that infant before, without feeling an indefinable something that was wanting to the instincts of parental affection. If they could have found amusement in originality of character, and the view of extreme beauty without virtue and self respect, and too often without repentance; they would have found it in the visits which they occasionally made in company with their friends among the immaculates, in the society of the “maculates.” They visited a ball room, filled with a blaze of apparent fashion and beauty; and the company had all the factitious airs, graces, and tone of the highest and most polished society. Most of them were reclaimed convicts. Every one had borne in some way a deep stain. Never had they seen such an exemplification of the “Apple of Sodom.” The sensation from the scene was bewildering. It was a painful labour to force the conviction on the beholders, that this splendour of beauty; this bewitching aspect of grace and sweetness; this vain show of a few hours; gave place, in the more free and unrestrained intercourse of their retirement, to all their native habits, and the use of their gross and vulgar colloquy. What a history of the “road to ruin” could each one of these syrens have given! Here the pick-pocket bowed most gracefully to the prostitute. There all the maudlin cant of sentimentality passed between a worn Celadon and Amelia. Each was ready to furnish materials for the biography of her neighbour; who, probably, at the same moment was occupied with some other person, in rendering the same kind office to her. At home, and among people of their own class, all calls for this kind of observance having ceased, the 6* paint being washed away, the tinsel torn off, and the clear light of day let in upon the scene; the whole aspect and character of the people stood forth in its naked and undisguised deformity. Then the disgusting slang of the colloquial intercourse among themselves, was heard. Then they were the first to ridicule their own assumption, and acting of decency in private. If these annals might be stained with samples of their horrid dialect, their interior language, their terms of art, and their previous callings, a vocabulary sufficiently ample and disgusting might be given. Well and deeply was this maxim engraved on the minds of Mr. Clenning and his wife, that the “true is the only beautiful.” As respected the general society of the colony, all the elements of bitterness, scandal, heart-burning, mutual rivalry, jealousy, and distrust, that are so apt to have an abundant existence in small, detached, and newly formed societies, existed here in combinations and forms, and to an extent that would have been ludicrous and amusing, if the predominance of evil in the picture had not thrown over it the aspect of disgust. “This,” they said to each other, “is not society. This is not that for which we left the innocence and repose of our happy island.” Both duty and hope prompted Augusta to wish to return to England. She still flattered herself that her father would receive her graciously, and take her and her husband home. Besides, they never forgot that they had a resource from dissatisfaction and disgust abroad, in the endearments and privacy of their interior intercourse with each other. With Rescue and their babe, they took long walks amid those new and interesting scenes. In addition to the deep verdure and boundless extent of the inaccessible forests, that had, until lately, slept from the creation, undisturbed by the sound of the axe, there was the interest of cultivated fields, fine gardens, sheep pastures, and orange groves bending with their golden fruit; and this impressive blending of nature and art, struggling for the mastery on the ruins of these ancient woods, rendered the scenery of the country a source of exhaustless interest to the lovers of nature. The strength and vigour of the cultivated vegetation cheered the eye, and refreshed the heart. From these walks they always returned to their home, satisfied and happy; with more confident hopes, and more enlarged feelings, and more adoring conceptions of the God of nature. Already had Mr. Clenning touched gently upon his wish to fix his family finally in his own native country. He often spoke of it with all the earnest feeling of instinctive patriotism. So often, and so eloquently had he compared his own great and good country with all others, that he made a firm convert of Rescue to his own predilections; and in her view, the United States were the home of all that is pleasant and desirable. Once or twice these themes had been urged with a warmth of nationality, that aroused that of Augusta, and drew from her in turn, a contrasted view of great, glorious, and unrivalled England, as it stood in her thoughts. They were daily importuned to fix themselves permanently in New Holland. But he had no dreams of happiness and final retreat, but in his own country. He did by no means fully enter into the sanguine confidence of his wife, that her father would receive them kindly. He thought it probable that his pride, if not his affection, might induce him to allow his daughter a pittance of his wealth, on condition of their agreeing to settle in America, where he might not be reminded of what he would doubtless deem his daughter's misalliance and disgrace. Hence his own hopes and dreamings of the future, constantly rested in America. A thousand circumstances conspired to make them both anxious to leave New Holland. Of their thousand dollars, only enough remained to pay their passage to England; and in that country, there appeared no chance to renew their means. Nameless circumstances of disgust were created constantly for him in the deportment of the people towards his wife, whom they affected, even to his face, to pity as a ruined heiress. They, of course, took a passage in the first packet ship that sailed for England; and were traversing the immense wastes of ocean for that country. Augusta trembled, indeed, and turned pale at first, at the thought of once more committing herself to that faithless element on which she had suffered so much. But they cheered each other, that their interest and duty alike required them to encounter this long voyage, and they mutually agreed, that if they once found a safe and comfortable harbour, they would cast anchor, and wander no more. It is true, he often smiled upon his wife, with dissembled confidence in his countenance, when his heart ached with the apprehension that her father would make their divorce or separation the only term upon which he would be reconciled to his daughter. Rescue, too, whose heart instinctively turned towards the green groves in which she was born, had received no pleasant associations with the country of money, luxury and art, and she carried a heavy heart upon the water. She often gave them to understand, in her own peculiar dialect, that she had seen enough of white people at Sidney Cove. She had imbibed a settled conviction, that her master and mistress were the only good white people in the world. “Oh, missee,” she would say, “good island! Sweet island! Fine trees; plenty bread-fruit; no work hard; all good; all happy; no want dollar to keep from starve; missee always smile. Oh, me wish we stay there! Bad people at Sidney Cove.” Still in the end of her lament, the faithful creature always gave them to understand that she had rather endure the scourge of living with white people with them, than live in the perennial freshness of her own groves without them. These demonstrations of unshaken attachment from Rescue, the increasing strength and beauty of their little daughter, training her to run alone notwithstanding the rocking of the ship, hearing the delightful lispings of her first articulations, mutual tracing of father and mother in the developing sweetness of her countenance; these joys of innocence, nature and affection, cheered the long voyage. They had some gales, but no severe or dangerous storms. They embarked in December, and in March they saw the white cliffs of Albion, and soon afterwards landed on the busy shores of the Thames, and were added as a drop to the ocean of human existence, in London. With a hundred dollars, and Augusta holding to his arm, and Rescue carrying their prattling daughter, they entered London in the dun fog of a March evening. The tall and outlandish form of Rescue, was but too well calculated to attract for them a painful degree of notice. They felt the strange and unpleasant sensation of treading their first reeling steps on terra firma, after having been so long accustomed to the feeling of a ship rolling under their feet. Amidst the gloom and dejection naturally inspired by such a scene, through which they desired to glide unnoticed and unknown, they could not but smile to witness the keen black eyes of Rescue, wild with curiosity, glaring upon the multitude of strange and surprising objects about her. Unconscious of the object and motive of the laughter of the spectators, she laughed with them as good naturedly as if she herself had not furnished them with their amusement. To every mind capable of entering into their condition, no effort will be necessary to paint its features of gloom and discouragement. Carriages rattled past them. The glare of wealth surrounded them. A crowd of busy and bustling people filled the streets, like the uninterrupted current of a river. On all sides was life and animation. Every countenance wore the careless and unconcerned consciousness of being surrounded with friends, and having an object and an asylum. Poor and unfriended strangers from the extremities of the globe, without money, friends, or home, and with no prospect of finding a place in which to lay their heads; they were borne along the same tide of life with the rest, mutually gazing, and exciting their gaze. It did not lessen the bitterness of the contrast with Augusta, to remember the period when she had been borne along those very streets, in her gilded chariot, the fairest, and the gayest of the gay. The gloomy sky conspired with the natural smoke and darkness of the city, to add deeper shade to the sadness of their prospects. As he felt his spirits sink, and despondency making its way to his heart, he summoned up all his manhood, and measured the beautiful and frail being, whose destiny was so identified with his, and who required all his energy to enable him to support her and his babe. Happily she was a mother; and as they spoke of their prospects, she embraced and kissed the little smiler in the arms of Rescue, and declared that she was sorry for nothing, and found nothing difficult, or unpleasant. On the contrary, she exhorted her husband to take courage, and banish dejection from his heart, that it might disappear from his countenance. After much inquiry, and frequent pauses in the different public houses, before the light of the day was gone, they obtained in the fourth story, a little dark apartment, with two beds; and having ordered a cheap and frugal supper, they proceeded to devise and arrange operations for the morrow. During the voyage, he and his wife had made joint stock of their invention, and had, after infinite study, and blotting and destroying a dozen copies, agreed upon a letter that was to be despatched to her father, immediately upon their arrival in the city. It gave a succinct, but clear and impressive account of the manner in which Mr. Clenning had found his daughter. It presented an affecting, because a just and true account of the condition from which he had rescued her. It proceeded, with guarded delicacy, to unfold the various motives and circumstances that led to their union. It gave the details of their attempt to escape by sea in the boat; and on the failure of that attempt, their hopelessness of ever making their escape afterwards. The latter part purported to be entirely the statement of his daughter. It dwelt upon the honour and decorum of her husband, before their union; and of his entire devotedness to her comfort and happiness, during all their residence together. It generously exonerated him from having originated the project of marriage. With equal delicacy and tenderness, she described the progress of affection and gratitude, in view of his deportment towards her. She represented the union rather as of her seeking than his. She stated, that they had been subsequently united by the laws of the country, and with all the solemnities of religion, and that in whatever light her father might choose to view him, in the sight of heaven and earth, and by all laws, human and divine, he was the true and lawful husband of her legal duties and obligations, as well as those of her affection and her heart. But she conjured her father, by his old age, by the filial affection VOL. II.—7 and duty of his only child, by their dear babe, and by every motive that could soften the heart, to receive, and bless, and acknowledge his daughter, as one returned from the dead. Even her husband, albeit unused to the melting mood, gave tears to the simple and touching paintings of maternal tenderness. In short, it was an energetic appeal to his feelings, at once so true and natural, so simple and affecting, that it struck them as impossible that he could withstand it. On making the proper inquiry, they found that her father had arrived in England, and was now at his usual residence in the city. They sent this letter, the joint production of their inventions, to the residence of her father; and he spent the remainder of the day in such an agony of suspense, as effectually extinguished the power to make any other effort, and repressed any disposition to go abroad, or converse with any one. Rescue caught the common gloom. Angusta paced her little dark apartment, alternately kissing her babe, and looking upwards. A thousand times they traversed the dark precincts of their apartment, in alternate paroxysms of hope and despair. In this manner they passed that and the succeeding day, neither going abroad, or having any other communication with any one, than receiving their frugal meals, as they were sent to them. On the evening of the second day, they received a letter, directed to a person calling herself Augusta Clenning. It was conceived in the following terms. “I should have considered the letter you have done me the honour to write me, as a pleasant attempt at forgery and imposition, had not the resemblance to the hand-writing of my daughter induced me to bestow some degree of credit to the strange story which it narrates. If you are indeed my daughter, that you were saved from the wreck, as things have happened, I may consider good fortune or otherwise, as circumstances may hereafter determine. Whether I am hereafter to know you as my daughter, will depend upon a contingency, over which you only have the control. I am not disposed, as you perhaps will anticipate, to attempt menance, intimidation, or command. I shall take a perfectly cool and dispassionate view of this affair. Were I to manifest any warmth, it might excite future hopes of playing upon my feelings, and might lead to unwarranted hopes, and consequent disappointment. Neither am I about to appeal to the dormant pride which belonged to her who was my child; nor shall I utter reproaches upon the immorality and dishonour of this misalliance, which you say you have consummated; nor remind you, on your own showing, that it was unnecessary. If the predicament were such as you state, I know enough of female nature to palliate your folly. That you extenuate the ungenerous advantage taken of your misfortunes, by him you call your husband, only proves that you are, or would be thought to be, still under the influence of that feeling, which silly girls call love. This illusion ought long since to have passed away. There are few young persons in this city, at present, so simple as to suppose that the childish liking, formerly called love, means any thing more than a word to palliate the conduct of persons with weak heads and libidinous inclinations. If you once deemed yourself in this predicament, you surely ought to have recovered your sober reason ere this. The person of whom you speak, you say, has loaned a thousand dollars at Sidney Cove, on my credit. Now to the point. The past is irrevocable. But we may operate upon the future. This marriage may all be passed by, as a thing that has not been. To spare your eloquence, I am ready to grant you that this person has been brave, disinterested, and so forth. These are qualities of common, and every day show. Our tars are brave, and said to be generous. Our soldiers are brave. Every good little book makes its heroes and heroines brave and disinterested, and all that. Thousands of these paragons can be purchased in our city for half a guinea apiece. But I cannot learn that more people are born rich and distinguished than formerly. Now let me whisper to you, be a wise girl. I will place all that has happened to necessity and circumstances. Some of our garretteers may, perhaps, take you up, and make a tragi-comedy, or a romance out of you, and you will only become the more distinguished for what has happened. I will receive you, asking no questions, nor ever recurring to the past. The other unfortunate circumstance I will send into the country. I will either cause this marriage to be as though it had not been, or I will procure it to be annulled. I will also repay the thousand dollars, and do something for that person, provided you return alone, and promise me that you will see him no more. Otherwise I request you neither to write, introduce yourself, nor importune me, either in person, or by another. No stratagem will circumvent me; no eloquence move me. You can well remember, whether I was easily moved even when you were the pride of my heart, and my all. I am neither younger nor weaker than formerly; and you cannot but recollect that you never saw me, as a babe, easily affected either to joy or tears. I have no respect for any one whose judgment does not preponderate over his feelings. I am cool, and I wish you to infer from it, that I am determined. Take time for consideration; four days if you please. If, after mature deliberation, you should see fit to accept 7* the terms, come to my house alone, and be received by your father. If you still prefer to live with that person, I shall be happy to serve you as I would another stranger, that is, with kind wishes and good advice, but shall otherwise be to you, as to others, simply, “Augustus Wellman.” They both stood petrified with amazement and indignation, while they were reading this cool, cutting and unnatural letter. The husband had the satisfaction to see the daughter, in this severe trial, yield to the wife and the mother. A momentary paleness, and a few starting tears marked the impulse of filial feeling. But it was followed by the burning blush of shame, and offended pride and humanity. Whatever views they took, they were rather braced than dispirited and discouraged. Such cruel indignity could be met by but one feeling. Rescue looked upon them while this decisive letter was reading, with such affectionate curiosity to know the contents, that they read it to her. The terms, as might be expected, said nothing to her. But when they explained the purport, she snapped her fingers, as vehemently from wrath, as she was accustomed to do at other times from joy. “Oh! massee,” she said, “these bad white people. You no call that man father. Walls black. Smoky houses. Bawl, cry all day and all night, in the streets. Carts rattle. Dust fly. Chimney sweeps all smut. No heart here. All bad. You starve here for want eat. Sky black. Sun, he no shine. White people bad! bad! Bad over the sea. Worse here. Oh! massee, go, go to Rescue's island. Never mind. You like to stay here. Me strong. All say, you good, Rescue, for work. Me work hard. We make eat. Dear little missee, you no die for starve!” At the same time she pressed the babe to her bosom, and watered its face with tears. This artless and disinterested affection of Rescue, brought relief also to Augusta, in the form of tears, which she shed freely and which her husband wiped away. They agreed, that after such an example, by a person comparatively unconnected with their sufferings, it would be pusillanimous to sit down, and give themselves up to unnerving despondency. The emergency of the case drew from Augusta unwonted marks of tenderness to her husband, whom she now perceived to be all of protection and hope that remained to her. While her husband lamented the poverty and ruin that he had entailed upon her, she assured him, that if at that moment all the advantages of her former condition, and the most cordial reception from her father, were spread before her on the one hand, and her husband and babe on the other, she should not hesitate a moment She declared, that she was forever cured of a desire for the vain show of the world; that her heart was humbled, and her desires limited to competence and obscurity with her husband and child; and that all she now wished was, that they might immediately seek for honest employment, in which they might eat the bread of industry. But when they reviewed the subject, after they had retired to their beds, he thought it possible that her father might yet relent. It was incredible to him, that there could be a human heart formed as his appeared to be. It was in vain that she warned him of his inflexibility of purpose, and that any farther efforts to move him would only be to experience new disappointment and humiliation. He, on the contrary, insisted that his conscience would reproach him until he was sure that he had made all possible efforts; and that no part of the failure could be attributed to their want of exertion, or neglect to use all the means of attempt, to soften his heart to the feelings and the claims of nature. They considered whether it would be expedient for her to accompany her husband on his purposed visit to her father. She shrunk from the idea, as one too harrowing and of too much pain, and admitted, that the very thought of such a meeting was insupportable. She had indulged, she said, the long and bitter penance of hope deferred. It was now for ever crushed; and all she wished for the future was, a spirit of affectionate forgiveness towards her father, and a firm and persevering purpose to look for no future prospects, but those which should arise from personal labour and exertion for themselves. Such views of the forbearance and generous feeling of his wife, supplied him in the morning with an indignation, that he trusted would stand him instead of self-possession and eloquence, and forearming himself as he might from other sources, he set out immediately after breakfast in the morning for the court end of the city, where Mr. Wellman resided. His splendid mansion was found without difficulty, being conspicuous among those aristocratic establishments. He rang for admittance. A gaily dressed servant, in the reflected insolence of his master, surveyed him in a moment from head to foot; and he was painfully aware, made up his conclusion, that he was a person of very little consequence. He somewhat hesitatingly said, that his master was not at home. Mr. Clenning replied, that this would not pass with him; and if his master was at home, he had business of importance with him and must see him. He had the satisfaction to remark, that his erect and stern manner induced the servant to survey him again. He had been used to seeing the poor, at once obsequious and timid. He appeared to think, that there must be more in this applicant than showed externally. This peremptory manner associated in his thoughts with concealed importance, and he showed him in with some degree of deference, observing that perhaps he was mistaken, and he would inquire if his master was about the house. He followed this servant along a corridor of patrician grandeur. The frowning portraits of the great ancestors seemed to upbraid the humble stranger for his unhallowed alliance with their blood, as they looked at him from their walls. Every thing wore the cold, repulsive and petrifying air of aristocratic insolence. A spiral staircase conducted him to an apartment, into which he was desired to enter. With a kind of ironical surprise at finding his master there, the servant announced his name. In this splendid apartment sat Mr. Wellman on a sopha. Notwithstanding the change wrought by six years, Mr. Clenning instantly recognized his countenance, and had the satisfaction to perceive, that his was as well remembered, though Mr. Wellman affected not to know him. He was received with a cold and measured civility, and was asked his commands. He commenced his story, and appealed to events on their passage in the Australasia. “Oh yes,” said Mr. Wellman, “you are right. You are the person who went out with us steward of that unlucky ship. How have you been, sir? Will you please to relate your business with me?” Mr. Clenning swallowed the first words that arose to his tongue. Mr. Wellman visibly enjoyed his embarrassment and hesitation, little divining the motive from which it arose. He paused until he had gained entire self-command, and then resumed his story, by remarking, that after the information which had reached him, if it were necessary for him still to explain his wishes in this interview, he might as well retire in silence. “Exactly so,” answered Mr. Wellman, with a calm smile. “I regret that you should have given yourself the unnecessary trouble to call, after what I wrote yesterday to my late daughter. If she be indeed with you, she knows precisely on what terms she may expect my recognition and favour. It is possible she communicated the contents of that letter to you.” Mr. Clenning replied, that she had; and proceeded to a detail of the prominent incidents of their residence together on the island. “Sir,” replied Mr. Wellman, “this detail is wholly unnecessary. The relation cannot be pleasant to either. It is an unhappy business. If you can find means to publish it, the romance in the story might turn it to profit. But I am a mere plain son of the earth, a matter of fact man, who care little for that sort of things. Let all that pass. I deem you to be a man of shrewdness and cleverness in your way. I appeal to yourself, sir; to your knowledge of the world. Fortune has given you a strange intimacy with my family, which cannot be helped. It is now time that it be terminated. You know all that I would say to you. There need be no sensibility or eloquence expended upon either side. When you please to call upon me in any other relation than that which you now affect to sustain, I shall wait upon with pleasure. At present I regret to say I am engaged. Joseph, please to show this gentleman down stairs. Sir, I have the honour to wish you a good morning.” There are indignities of a certain class, that preclude all compromise, and all possibility that an honourable man can ever submit voluntarily to endure them a second time. Such he felt to be the present one. He turned calmly away, fully determined never to meet with this man again, and he walked down the magnificent passages with such a real contempt for the hearfless possessor, and such feelings of inward complacency of self-comparison, that indignation and contempt served him instead of philosophy. But on his way home, this feeling no longer sustained him, when he thought how he should break the result of this interview to his wife. It was painful even to remember the relation between her and this man; and he found a struggle necessary in order to break off the association, that a woman so inexpressibly dear to him, was the daughter of such a father. When he returned to his little dark apartment, forming such a contrast to the house he had just visited, he found any relation of the success of his interview unnecessary. “My dear Arthur,” said his wife, “had you not been too wilful to listen to your wife, all this might have been spared. You must allow yourself to doubt for a moment, whether I have a heart. It becomes me to remember my father, and pray for him. It becomes you to banish all thoughts, that connect me with him. Let us be humble and industrious, affectionate and contented, and forget all that I once was.” She kissed alternately her babe and her husband, and paused for a moment, under the influence of emotion that would not be suppressed. She then calmly resumed, “Had my father received me to favour, I should have plunged once more into the extravagance and dissipation incident to our course of life. My pride would have taken root anew in my heart. A thousand circumstances, my dear Arthur, would have wounded you with odious comparisons. I am sure of your love. Had it continued in the new order of things, your heart would have been broken. My reason, my better judgment tells me, that happiness is with peace and humility, and industry, in the shade. Look at our sweet babe. See how perfectly healthy it is. I, too, am well. Rescue loves us, and is strong, and with us for evil or good. Let us love each VOL. II.—8 other, and regulate our thoughts. I shall be as proud, my dear Arthur, of showing you that I can be a philosopher, as I should have been to be pointed out as the brightest star of attraction, in the circle which would have assembled round me at my father's house. You shall never see me gloomy, or showing regret for what I have lost. You shall never have occasion to doubt for a moment that I remember all that you have been to me; and that if the alternative were offered again, I would hesitate to do again what I have done. Thank God, misfortunes have taught me the necessity of high purpose and resolve. We will pass the waves once more. To prove to you how entirely every thought is identified with you, I wish to go with you to your own country, and in its shades forget that I was ever a fine lady.” It may be imagined with what eyes this happy husband contemplated his young and lovely wife, making a strong effort to repress her native pride, and forming these noble and necessary resolutions, in their little, dark, miserable apartment; her eyes glistening with tenderness and affection, through the tears which contending emotions had started. He was just returned from the splendid mansion, which was ready to open to welcome her on the simple condition of renouncing her husband. He remembered, too, the myriads to whom that tie is a galling yoke, before the lapse of the first month, and who would renounce it with joy, were it in their power, at the simple temptation of regaining freedom. He was too deeply read in human nature, not to see all that was implied in this deportment. He strained his wife to his bosom with deeper sentiments than those known by the name of love. “Augusta,” said he, “you arm me with unfailing strength to do, or suffer. Have no fear. We will go to America, and my whole study shall be to become an example to husbands, as you are to wives.” He immediately went abroad in search of the means of subsistence—a sufficiently disheartening business in such a place. But the cheering sensation, derived from this conversation at home encouraged him, and imparted warmth and confidence to sustain him under repulse, discouragement, and failure. He returned, and as the lips of his wife pressed his cheek, dejection fled. He went abroad envigorated to sustain new repulses and the extinction of one hope and project after another. Day after day passed, in fruitless efforts to obtain subsistence. Dollar after dollar disappeared, and the baker and the landlord appeared within an hour after their weekly claims were due. Rescue sometimes allowed a tear to escape her dark olive cheek, as they contracted their three meals to two, and began to husband the crumbs with a silent, but heart-rending economy. “Bad, bad white people,” said Rescue, as she saw her master returning with discouragement and failure on his brow. “Will they let my sweet little missee starve?” The object of these unutterable feelings, meanwhile, chirped and amused herself with her first efforts to walk about the room, in the glee of infantine existence, happily unconscious of the agony of anxiety felt on her account, and exulting in the joyous perception of her growing strength. The first avails of their industry were from the hands of his wife, whose beautiful needle-work finally found an employer. She wrought incessantly during her husband's discouraging excursions for employment abroad. She afterwards declared, that the proudest and happiest moment of her existence was that, when by actual experiment, she convinced her husband that she had earned in a day, some trifle more than its expenditures. Rescue, too, found employment in the kitchen of their landlady, and that was sufficient to discharge their rent. Such omens began to cheer them at the moment of the lowest ebb of their fortunes, and when but five dollars remained to them. It is true it was but bread, the cheapest and coarsest fare, that could be obtained by their united exertions; and if from sickness or want of employment, they should remit their exertions for a day, the stream carried them down again. But such is the effect of circumstances, even this was hope and good fortune, in comparison with the recent prospect of actual want staring them in the face. At length, to his inexpressible joy, he also found employment, as a transcriber in the office of a considerable publisher. He had laboured three days on trial, and was accepted after that probation. The united avails of their industry, not only warranted the addition of various comforts to their living, but considerably exceeded their expenses. A bank was immediately commenced, which was to constitute an accumulating fund, until it should amount to a sufficiency to pay their passage to America. The most pleasant circumstance appertaining to his employment was, that he could carry home the thing in hand to be transcribed, and labour on it in the enjoyment of the society of his wife. She, meanwhile, plied her needle incessantly, only now and then pausing to watch the delighted efforts of her babe, to make its independent way by the chairs and tables round the room, or occasionally struggling to climb the father's knee, and arrest the movements of his pen, to give him the more pleasant employment of fondling, and playing with it. How few there are who can realize, that people so situated and occupied, could be happy! Yet they were then a thousand times happier than the tenants of palaces, in the 8 * indulgence of unbridled wishes and pampered repinings, and the tortures of pride and envy. With the first hour of leisure, in this new predicament of comparative comfort and hope, he wrote to the kind friend at New Holland, who had loaned him a thousand dollars, informing him faithfully, though with infinite regret, how his hopes with Mr. Wellman had terminated, and promising that he would never lose sight of the debt, until Providence should open to him some way of discharging it. Whenever he had a leisure hour in the intervals of his employment, he hasted to the river to make himself acquainted with the American captains; determining, as soon as he could find one in whom he could have confidence, and who would trust him for a passage to America, to embark for that free and abundant country. He had learned not to be discouraged with the first repulse, and if he failed in his purposes to-day, to cheer himself with better hopes for the morrow. Divines have preached that happiness is a thing of the mind. Poets have sung, and moralists prosed to the same tune. They were placed in a predicament to feel, that it depended on themselves. More frequently than at first, he was compelled to remain all day at the office where he was employed, and this was a painful privation to him, to whose heart home was a paradise, and every other place a wilderness. But, on the other hand, his services were more highly estimated. Others were ready to make him better offers, and his wages were raised. Here, then, for the most part, he drudged through the day. But he had learned the all-important axiom of philosophy, that pleasure must always be earned by abstinence and privation. He cast an occasional glance from his constant employment, to the hand on the dial plate of an old clock that ticked in his office, watching the pointing that should indicate the time when he might rise from his desk and hie home to his own little world. To say that he waited this moment as the lover does the hour of his appointment, would but faintly shadow his feeling. There is a sacredness in the thought of home, and the embraces of a beloved wife and children, with which the throbbings of desire and the transports of sense can bear no parallel. His step was recognized as he mounted the stairs. The infant Augusta began to frolic. The mother received him with open arms. Just before supper, the labours of Rescue were completed, and she joined them by her eager affection, and the bounding of her ardent heart in the joy of home, and by the simple shrewdness of her mind, and her amusing dialect increasing their enjoyments. Sometimes she sung her own namby pamby to her favourite babe; and at others sat with intense interest, looking in the countenances of her master and mistress, as they gave the details of the past day. Thus they purchased the pure and high domestic satisfactions of a long evening by the privations and absence of the day of labour. Not unfrequently they instituted fair and philosophical comparisons of their present condition with the noble grotto, the smiling sky, the flowering forest, and the solitary and indolent exuberance of their island residence. With Rescue, there was always but one feeling, and this was, that she would be glad if they could mount the winds, and fly back again to that happy country. But her master and misstress reasoned more justly. They understood the influence of moral ties, the necessary associations with social life, the power of habit, and the necessity of giving value to repose by toil, and of purchasing enjoyment by privation. They came to the conviction, that even their present modes of life, unpleasant as they were in some respects, were not only more useful to others, but happier to themselves, than to reside in a region where they had few relative duties, and scarcely any thing to do but to chase after an enjoyment which in such cases is too apt still to keep in advance of the pursuers. Seclusion, they were convinced, was but for dreaming enthusiasts; and the solitary shades of their late island, only fit for pastoral songs. In the stern walks of competition and industry, they felt that there was not only the call of duty, but the best meed of enjoyment. They were contented, industrious, healthy, and useful; and felt that they were happy, and ought to be so. Their little daughter grew in strength, beauty, and endearment; and its innocent prattle never failed to make its way to their hearts. The only drawback to their felicity was their inability to pay their debt to their New Holland friend, and to find an American captain ready to trust them for the price of a passage to America. Mr. Clenning was surprised one evening on his return from his daily toil, to find in their humble apartment a young gentleman apparently of the age of twenty-five, with a fine person, superbly dressed, and in his whole appearance and bearing, discovering to the most superficial glance, that he was of high rank and one of the favourites of fortune. He saw, too, that his wife had been in tears. The stranger evidently had studied to preserve the insolent indifference, proper to carry him through his purpose; which was, against the remonstrances of Augusta, to see and converse with her husband. But it would not do, and his countenance blenched with guilty confusion. He introduced himself as Frederic B. Mr. Clenning remembered in a moment, that he had heard his wife mention the name a hundred times, and speak of him as the most interesting and favoured of her admirers. He was titled, rich, accomplished, and of extensive country influence. Mr. Wellman, however, had formerly espoused a different interest; and to a man rich, proud, wilful, and devoted inflexibly to his opinions, this difference had proved a barrier in the way of accepting him as a favoured lover for his daughter. One of the inducements of the father to emigrate to New Holland, was to arrest the progress of this growing liking between the parties. The father had returned, and found interests reversed. Lord Frederic B. was now as strongly identified with the schemes of Mr. Wellman, as he had been formerly opposed to them. He gained assurance, as he explained these circumstances to Mr. Clenning. He proceeded with dissembled calmness, to announce the purport of his visit, very adroitly prefacing his speech with the kindest and most generous intentions towards Mr. Clenning, and hoping that in the issue he should make it appear that he had his interests in view, as well as those of all the parties concerned. The comparison which flashed across Mr. Clenning's mind, in reference to the difference of their personal appearance in the eye of Augusta, was certainly calculated to excite no small jealousy and heart burning. He surveyed him, however, with a cool sternness, which clearly disconcerted the young nobleman exceedingly, and begged him to be prompt in disclosing his statements. The young gentleman, with a voice evidently ill assured, proceeded to state that he came deputed from Mr. Wellman, to make proposals. The husband and the wife started at the same moment at the term. He turned alternately pale and red, as he proceeded with the purport of his message. It was neither more not less than to pay over to Mr. Clenning a considerable sum of money, on condition that he would take the babe and embark with it for America. His passage he said should be paid; and if even a greater sum than he had offered was necessary, he requested him to name such an amount as would be satisfactory. He remarked that on those terms Augusta would be received and owned by her father. He proceeded with a great degree of acuteness and even eloquence to demonstrate that it was impossible either of the parties could be supposed to be happy, or to have any grounds of hoping to be so hereafter, as affairs then stood: this arrangement would be preferable in every point of view to all concerned. To Mr. Clenning it would bring comparative opulence and consequent consideration in his own country. It would enable him suitably to educate his child. It would restore his wife, he added, with some hesitation, to her own walk and condition in life, and to the bosom, the house, and wealth of the most affectionate of fathers. He concluded, by remarking, that it was easy to talk of affection, but that it had never been found capable of sustaining the pinching influence of poverty; and that he hoped Mrs. Clenning would not fail to see that the only real proof which her husband could give her of disinterested regard, was to promote her real interest, more especially as at the same time he advanced his own. He did not doubt that he loved her: Who could have been so situated, and have felt otherwise? He earnestly hoped that she would see in its true light any hesitancy on the part of Mr. Clenning, to comply with proposals so indispensable to her happiness. He closed and awaited their response. Tears started to her eyes, but her countenance glowed with indignation, and she looked to her husband to reply. “You hear,” said he, “Augusta, what kind thoughts this gentleman entertains in reference to us. I am as perfectly aware as he is, that I am in the way of what the world will prononuce your interest. It is useless for me to make professions any farther than to say, that I deceive myself, Augusta, if I do not prefer your interest to my own. It would be too much to exact of me, to advise you to accept these proffered terms. Consider the matter calmly, Augusta, and as you will see it hereafter, when poverty, sickness, and sorrow may press upon us. Be deliberate, and lay every consideration that might tend to pervert your judgment out of the case; and take care that you do not imbitter the future, by rejecting opportunities which may hereafter be remembered with unavailing regret.” With this, he took the little Augusta in his arms, kissing her, and saying, “Sweet, will you go with father, and live in the American woods?” While the child was lisping her consent, Augusta answered with unwonted severity, “Arthur, I had not expected this cruel irony from you. In another place it might have been harmless pleasantry. Here it is unworthy trifling with my feelings. I am not sir,” she added, turning to her former admirer, “what you once knew, a giddy and thoughtless girl, but a principled and virtuous wife and mother. You may imagine what you please, in regard to the difference which fortune has made between you and my husband. But to know with what eyes I look upon him, you must have been in all the positions in which I have been placed. Nobleness is of the mind, and no other person would have acted as he has done. I am outraged by this conversation. If you will be gone, and never repeat your visit, I enjoin forbearance on my husband until you are away.” Observing the blood mounting to the face of her husband, she said, “Arthur, I command you for the first time, and I exact it as a bridal favour. Allow this gentleman to pass unmolested for this time. If he should ever repeat his visit, I lay no restriction upon you in future.” “You see, sir,” said Mr. Clenning to the noble VOL. II.—9 visiter, “how matters are here. I will have the honour to show you quietly down stairs for this time. If you should see fit to repeat your visits to us, you will not regard it as blustering, or an idle threat, if I inform you that I will have the honour of throwing you down our steep and narrow staircase, without giving you the trouble of descending the intermediate steps.” The nobleman saw, from looks and tones, that matters were verging from words to actions. With no little trepidation, he made his exit. Mr. Clenning held the candle for him to the street door. He there muttered something about his dignity, and Mr. Clenning's unworthiness of his chastisement. The latter replied, “My lord, if that is your title, should you ever see fit to visit my family again in this way, I shall practise more humility than your lordship; and shall find you worthy of a most thorough correction; and with that information, I kiss your lordship's hands.” The uniform deportment of this little family; the industry and cheerfulness of Mrs. Clenning; the punctuality of the payments of her husband, and his beginning to be considered a thriving personage by the small dealers with whom he had intercourse; even the character of Rescue, which began to be understood through the singularity of her person and dialect; all these circumstances concurred to gain the good will of their immediate honest neighbours. Their landlord spoke of them in terms of high praise. Estimates of character, when they pass from one extreme are apt to vibrate to the opposite one. The neighbours began to entertain for them the respect which is every where felt for people of fallen fortunes, who bear the reverse as they ought. They were continually manifesting small proofs of affectionate kindness and considerate regard to their condition. Mrs. Clenning began to feel the natural complacency and gratitude, which results from perceiving kindness and good feeling manifested on all sides. From various sources, she ascertained that her story was generally known. She was aware that she was the subject of much conversation and discussion. In being wholly shunned by all her former friends and admirers, by the connections even of her father's family, she was most emphatically taught how completely they considered her debased and ruined by her plebeian connection, and her perseverance in sustaining it, after such offers on the part of her father. She well understood, that her wonderful escape, her strange fortunes, and her connection, as the papers had it, with a low American adventurer, effectually repressed any other feeling, in view of her case, than wonder or surprise. To find herself completely shunned and wholly overlooked in the city of her birth, and in the midst of her connections, would have excited, in an unregulated and undisciplined mind, wounded feelings of pride and revenge. She viewed the whole with calm indignation. “These,” said she to her husband, “these are the people whom I used to consider as containing the whole of society. These people that surround us were viewed as necessary in the scale of existence, but as neither formed to impart or receive pleasure or respect. They were estimated as being born to fill up the several employments, and perform the occupations necessary for the comfort of the real society of which I was a member. And yet these are to those as a thousand to one. I have learned, in the only way in which I could have learned it, to forego my foolish and degrading prejudices towards people in humble life, the less educated and polished people of the middle walks. How often have I smiled at the miserable wit of novel writers and play makers, when attempting to ridicule the million, the great mass of society. The insolent in the upper walks of life are accustomed to regard them from infancy as ignorant, boorish, and utterly incapable of any refined or generous feeling. These good people, I now see, have their affinities, their friendships, their circles, whose estimation and good opinion are dear to them. They are probably more influenced by public opinion than the higher classes. They have their high thoughts and generous feelings, and their strong friendships; and their conversations are often less frivolous and insipid than those to which I used so often to listen. Had I remained in my first sphere, I should never have understood these people at all. I may thank the course of events that has placed me here, for this important practical knowledge of the great mass of the species. I now see that the earth was not formed for a few hundred privileged men and women, as I once thought. Had I continued as I was, I might have passed through life with these unjust and hateful estimates of nine-tenths of the race. I hope, in time, to become, in this way of teaching, a genuine philanthropist.” These sentiments were not the less true and impressive to her husband, coming, as they did, from the lips of a young, graceful, and lovely woman, who had renounced opulence, and all its accompaniments, for his sake. Of course he gave strong demonstrations of being satisfied with the charming orator; and he told her, that he was sure they could get money and audiences, and do good, if she would only consent to go among the people, and preach such kind of lectures as a course, for a guinea a ticket, repeating to her, from Shakspeare, “Sweet are the uses of adversity.” In this constant course of labour, and calm 9* moderate excitement, laying up their mite every day, increasing their charities by extending their acquaintance, and becoming more identified with the good will and kind thoughts of their neighbours, passed away the spring and the summer of their residence in London. Augusta was at first cheerful from effort and philosophy: But this complacent feeling, in view of duties discharged, and good will increased, soon made that natural and easy, which was at first constrained. Mr. Clenning, who had formerly felt rather self-righteous in comparing his views with those of his wife, now was obliged to confess to himself, that the drudgery of his occupation, and his confinement away from his family, excited more impatience than he saw in her. But when he did at last drop his pen, he hied home with the eagerness of one who felt that he was going to impart joy, and receive it. Rescue's wild, but kind eye, sparkled with delight. The elder Augusta held out her arms to her husband. The younger Augusta, the miniature angel, as they called her, bustled into her father's lap, threw her tiny arms about his neck, and kissed him. The incidents of that day and the prospects of the next were talked over. Their fragrant tea smoked on their table, and they declared themselves, that they had no reason to envy the prime minister. They blessed God, that he had not shown himself a partial father, but had rendered every thing, that is really essential to well being, accessible to all. To them it was always a sacrifice to spend the evening away from their own hearth. But it was a sacrifice which they felt it a duty frequently to make. Instead of the common motive for going abroad, to get rid of the tedium of each other's society, they were impelled to this sacrifice, as a duty to the circle that manifested so much interest and good will towards them. But then neither would they countenance scandal or envious reviling of their superiors, or odious comparisons touching those with whom they associated. They conversed about their children, their training and education, their duties, their daily stock of cares and enjoyments, and the common charities and small occurrences that give the colour of joy or sorrow to passing existence. They generally returned from these humble parties happier and better, and always with the consciousness that they had governed their conversation and deportment there by a sense of duty. How many millions of such circles are there on the earth, that the insolent great know nothing about. On a sabbath evening during the summer, a wealthy neighbour who had taken an interest in them, threw open a garden, in which there were trees, to give them a walk and the sight of nature. The little Augusta here evidenced the propensities of instinct, and that she had been desert-born. Her eye kindled. She exulted in the shade, and was as a water fowl restored after abstinence to the water. The father felt gloomy, for it reminded him of the boundless contiguity of shade in the island, and still more in his own native country. The very sight of a tree, the very rustling of leaves, although they were coated with dust to the colour of London smoke, brought back to Rescue such a flood of recollections, painful and bitter contrasts of all that with her native island, that her wild black eye wandered a while upon these mockeries of the virgin freshness of that rich and unpolluted landscape, and then filled with tears. The little Augusta affectionately asked, what made her cry? “Little missee, cause I love my own green woods.” Mr. Clenning changed the conversation, and spoke of the range, the noble forests, the independence, abundance and comfort of his native country, and assured Rescue that when they should once be there, she would have no more reason to regret their island. Here, in short, in a little patch of dusty verdure, surrounded on every side by high, dull, brown brick walls, was the place in which imagination was at home, in sketching the peaceful, independent, and rural life of the American farmer. They had so often meditated the project of transporting themselves there, and their thoughts had so often sketched delightful views of the country, that they had all become impatient to get there. The worst of it was, that it would require a full year, before they could accumulate enough to pay their passage to America, even in the steerage. Their impatience to get there, induced Mr. Clenning to continue his efforts to find a passage partly on credit. But, he had been disappointed so often, and had experienced so much humiliation in the case, that he only continued the pursuit with a kind of desperate purpose to submit to any rebuff, in order to be in the way of the remotest chance for such a desirable event. When he least expected it, the good fortune befell him. He met with an American captain of quick and tender feelings, who heard his little story with a very different air from the icy indifference with which it had been received in all cases before. He became interested in the narrative; and when Mr. Clenning expressed his fears that he should tire him by too much detail, he begged him to be particular, and his heart evidently entered into the story. At some passages he turned away to hide his emotion. “I will take you,” said he. “I am part owner of the ship. You shall not experience the humiliation of a steerage passage. Your fellow passengers are chiefly people of condition. I will see that you are on a footing with them in every respect. As to the passage, take your own time after your return to pay me. An honest man always pays as soon as he can, and I do not want it before.” This language was so utterly unlike what he commonly heard in such cases, that Mr. Clenning watched his countenance, to see if he was not dealing out some of that contemptible and unmeaning language of falsehood and deception, with which the worthless sometimes try to raise the hopes of the inexperienced in such cases, merely to disappoint them. But there was such a calm and upright look of sincerity and honour in what the captain had said, as inspired him with confidence. To doubt every body is a mark of a weaker, as well as more worthless mind, than to believe every body. The captain showed him on board. It was a fine new ship, and the splendour of the cabin inspired a sigh at the thought of the rapid strides of luxury in such a new country as America. The department of the under officers and sailors, and the visible tone of the intercourse between them and the captain, all tended to complete the conviction, that the proffers of the captain were the effusions of an honourable and generous heart. The agreement was accordingly made for the passage. Mr. Clenning hurried home with the joyful tidings to his family, that they must immediately commence their preparations for a voyage to New York. Their little, dark apartment was converted in a moment to a scene of jubilee. His wife embraced him, declaring, that she longed to put her foot on the soil of freedom and independence; and that she felt she was born to be a republican. Rescue capered and snapped her fingers as usual when in great glee. The little Augusta, seeing all the rest so happy and loving, clambered up the back of the chair, to get her kiss with the rest. Each congratulated the other, that they should soon have again the shade of forests, and the range of fields and woods, united with all the advantages and comforts of society. One painful circumstance attended their departure. In this little, dark nook, they had drawn round them a small circle of acquaintances, whose feelings towards them were fast ripening to the sure and tried truth of friendship. These people could not blame them for availing themselves of the offered opportunity, though they manifested marks of sincere and painful regret at the thought of losing their society. In this confined society, most of whose members had been born and had grown up in it, affection and kindness were concentered by the narrowness of the extent in which it operated. These quit, sober, humble people, who had been born, and would probably die in a circle whose diameter was scarcely a league, whose life was marked with few incidents; who knew not proud thoughts and frivolous distractions, clearly regarded the prospect of losing their society, as a disaster in their humble history. They would never have known the force and earnestness of the affection they had inspired, if the announcement of this approaching separation had not strongly called forth unquestionable proofs of it. They drew another important lesson from their residence there. It is human nature to suppose, that they who have no marked place, or distinguished standing in society, are forgotten and overlooked, and without bearing and influence upon that society. In consequence of this mistaken impression, many a man has lost self-respect, in conducting so as to lose that of others. Patient, consistent and undeviating rectitude of character, shines more widely even from a humble centre, than is generally suspected. Let them who wish to test the truth of this remark, act immorally and worthlessly. Let them be intemperate, quarrelsome, perfidious and dishonest. Let them see how soon the savour of these traits will spread. The world may seem to be indifferent; but it takes a sharp notice at least of the faults, if not the virtues even of the humble and obscure. The grand maxim that ought to encourage and sustain every one in undeviating correctness is, that it is not only right in itself, but will not fail ultimately to bring friends and estimation. Such they found had been the result of their course there. Every demonstration of considerate good feeling was shown them by these humble friends. Many presents of affection were prepared, and many little comforts offered for their approaching voyage. The little Augusta was arrayed in the full fashion of London finery, and many of the customary promises of correspondence exacted. Mr. Clenning, meanwhile, had been accustomed to go regularly to the post-office, expecting, yet dreading to hear from his disappointed friend in New Holland, and possibly entertaining the latent hope that Augusta's father might yet relent and do something for them. They knew that he was well informed of all the steps they took. They heard nothing indeed from either of those quarters. But he was delighted by receiving a letter from another quarter. On opening it, he was astonished to find enclosed in it five hundred pounds, in bank notes of one hundred pounds each. The first thought was, that it came indirectly from his father-in-law. The contents, which were these, soon undeceived them: “Sir,—As an obscure stranger, you may consider yourself deserted as well as unknown. This will prove you mistaken. The writer of this has had an eye upon you, and knows many passages of your conduct, which you might have supposed confined to your own memories. The result of the investigation has been, to determine me to enclose the money which you find in this. The circumstances of the writer are not independent. But, although only comfortable, they allow him to do a generous action. He believes that your charming wife, who has acted so nobly and consistently, will one day reap the reward of such conduct, and come into possession of her rights. Should this be the case, if the writer survives, he will make himself known to you, and then you may consider this as a loan. If the event should be otherwise, the writer has no children, no relatives that are near, is a humourist, without ill nature, and will not regret to reflect upon this sum, as a gift to modest, dignified and suffering worth. “AN UNKNOWN FRIEND.” Ah! if the opulent, if those favoured by fortune knew or could know the uses which they might make of their surplus wealth; if they knew how many people through honest and commendable pride appear to be comfortable, and yet pine in secret under the pressure of the most afflicting wants; if they knew how much happiness money rightly bestowed even in loans, may impart: such acts as this would be more common, and would not wear such an air of improbability from the unfrequency of their occurrence. If they considered their ability to do good in this way, they would not continue to squander in lavish and useless expenditures, which gratify only the insatiate cravings of fancy or pride, what might thus make a virtuous fellow being in distress happy. Let them imagine such a family as this —and no doubt many such exist—and picture to themselves the agony of parents seeing their children suffer for want of clothing and bread, or even from the existence of the immediate apprehension of this suffering, and then consider, that there are men who squander in a day what would render such a family comfortable for a year. Surely if men had hearts, and saw what kind of a world this is to the poor and the unfortunate, they could find higher pleasures, than those of the gaming table, the horse race, the haunts of licentiousness, or even the useless luxury of extravagant parties, made only for cold-hearted display. Little do the wealthy know, and less do they feel the bitter character of real, stern, irresistible want, involving in its pressure a beloved wife, cherished babes, and every thing dear on the earth. We will not believe that there are many who cannot imagine how Mr. Clenning's heart danced for joy, during his progress home from the post office. Imagine him then opening the letter, and spreading the bills before his wife and Rescue, who by this time understood but too well by the want of them, the magic efficacy of these powerful slips of paper. She snapped her fingers, and capered with an extra flourish. “Bad money,” she said; “He good and bad. Want him, make sorry too much. Get him, make glad too much.” Mr. Clenning asked her if she did not now believe that there were some good white people. “Good!” said Rescue, “aye, he good. Me pray God hard for him to-night!” There can be no doubt that Mr. Clenning felt a particular pride in repairing to the excellent and noble-minded captain, and paying the passage for his family in advance. At the same time he related his good fortune. The captain seemed even reluctant to take the money, informing him that this unknown benefactor had deprived him of the pleasure of the generous action which he contemplated; but he added, that if Mr. Clenning should resolve, as he had expressed himself, to purchase a farm after his arrival in the United States, he would add to what might remain to him after the passage, the loan of a sufficient sum to enable him to make his proposed purchase. Their farewell to London was one in which pleasure and pain were mixed. They certainly left their mean and dark apartment with pleasure. Augusta felt no regret in leaving a city where not a single relative or friend deigned to recognise her, and where she had played the highest and the most obscure part alternately. There were no pleasant associations to detain her. But it was painful to leave those kind, though humble friends, who really cherished them. It is true, a tear dimmed the eye of Augusta, as she looked in the direction of the princely mansion of her father. She took an impressive leave of her kind neighbours who accompanied her to the ship. The parting for a voyage over the trackless and dangerous deep, is always an affecting spectacle. Mr. Clenning and his wife quietly seated themselves on the deck, with Rescue holding the hand of her little charge, close beside them, and calmly watched the feverish and tumultuous spectacle of leave-taking. As the ship moved off, “Hail to my country,” said the husband. “If I once set my foot on thy shores, I will leave thee no more.” “Farewell England,” said his wife; “and may God forgive those who have forsaken me.” Conspicuous among their fellow passengers, were three or four English merchants, of a character precisely similar to the greater portion of those who visit our shores from that country. The dandy witling of the town, critic, merchant, and cockney, were all so blended in them, that it was impossible to say where one ended, and the other began. It excited alternate amusement and indignation to hear these people describe the United States. The country for which they were bound, 10* and where they went with the avowed object to make their fortunes, was the constant theme of their vilification, ridicule, and abuse. Their dialect was as amusing as the matter of their conversation. All the canons of criticism were, of course, completely at their command; and if any one ventured the slightest dissent, though it were in a matter of taste and opinion, about which, it is the common saw, there ought to be no dispute, he was knocked down with the “Edinburgh or the London Quarterlies.” Their estimates of American taste were derived from the fourth of July orations of twenty years past, and Mr. Barlow's Columbiad; they being pleased to consider these productions as fair samples of what had been done, or could be done in the literary way. Their standing theme of wit was the awkwardness and ignorance of “Jonathan,” whom they considered a thick-headed, timid sort of fellow, whose fare, physical and intellectual, was exceeding meagre; and touching whom, it was a mystery that with such a muddy and uninstructed brain, he should be able to manage his own affairs, and make his way in the world as well as he did. The rank and beauty, along with the story of Mrs. Clenning, as told with all the comments and conjectures of fancy, inspired them, at first, with a certain degree of respect for her. But they gradually broke over their reserve, and began to treat her with cockney compliments, in the absence of her husband. They soon learned that she was disinherited, and yoked for life to a plebcian yankee. From familiarity, their manners gradually advanced to rudeness, and they attempted to play the amiable, with an insolence and confidence resulting from their ignorance and vanity, which induced Mr. Clenning one evening to announce to one of them, when no person was present, save themselves and the captain, that if ever he should have the audacity to conduct in the same way towards Mrs. Clenning a second time, he would have the honour of administering the sea bath to him, by throwing him overboard. His cheek blanched to the paleness of death as he measured, with his eye, the muscular form of the American, and saw, by the flashing of his eye, that he was in sober earnest. This suggestion had a most salutary effect, and the Englishman observed a respectful distance of manner towards them during the remainder of the voyage. There were also a couple of young gentlemen on board, sons of wealthy merchants in the United States. They were returning home from the tour of Europe. They conversed together as friends, though they were the strongest contrast to each other in nature. One was a modest, amiable, well informed young man, perfectly affable in his manners, who had apparently made an excellent use of his eyes and his intellect on his tour. He had stored his mind with an abundance of that necessary information which travelling only can supply. His conversation was equally instructive and interesting, and his standard of refinement and good manners was simplicity, truth, and nature. With him Mr. Clenning passed many pleasant hours on the voyage, and thus contracted a friendship which he afterwards found of essential service to him. The other was a sample of that poor and spoiled race of young men, of which our country annually imports so many; who return from abroad to annoy the inhabitants of the cities with the intolerable garrulity of travelled coxcombs, and to learn the people in the country how trifling, vain, and contemptible a young man may become, from the very circumstance of having extended his sphere of observation. There was no end to the wonders he had seen, nor the artists, connoisseurs, and fashionable and great men, with whom he had been familiarly conversant. At one time, he instructed the people at the breakfast table what kind of place the “palais royale” was. At another, they heard long dissertations about the Pantheon and St. Peter's. There was no great man in any line in Europe, with whom he had not familiarly met. It was edifying to hear and see with what a sapient air he could rote all the chief actors and singers at the different courts of Europe, in a most mysterious dialect of bad French, bad Italian, and cockney English, that almost needed an interpreter. This star, it is true, sometimes became pale, when he came in contact with the Londoners, who were birds of the same feather, but sung a different tune. They affected to regard the pretensions of the travelled Yankee with ineffable disdain, and all parties on board were delighted to hear them lisp defiances, in point of pretension, towards each other. This happy action and reaction had the effect to neutralize the annoying forwardness of both parties. They were mutually afraid of each other, and out of their opposition grew their peace. The orb of the one never rose upon them, until that of the other was below the horizon. This young travelled American sat near Mrs. Clenning at table every day; but he always affected not to know her; and though he had been heard to pronounce her beauty “severe,” he spoke of her as a poor undone thing, who might have made her fortune out of her face alone; and he was often seen to eye her, half bent, with his quizzing glass, as though he were taking a survey of her from a distant box of the theatre. They had also on board a young gentleman, who had been in some way attached to a foreign mission. He was a man of gravity, and never walked the deck but with the true gait consequential. To him the secrets of courts were familiar. To him oracular diplomatists were known. He had been closeted with men, who, Atlas-like, helped to prop the world. He always wore the close brow of the mighty political secret; and to hear him, these great men of state were not wrought upon by fashion, folly, and physic, like other people. It was only for some one to broach any question, touching the general politics of Europe, and forth stalked the great men of England and the continent, like drill soldiers on parade. Every great man with whom he had spoken, and every court that he had visited, had added something of height to his stature. In the society of the captain, and his young travelled friend, Mr. Clenning lost sight for a time of his anxieties. But, as it ought to be, all his home and deep felt enjoyments were in the privacy of his little state room, into which the father and mother, the little Augusta and Rescue, could just crowd. Here they talked of their future plans of industry and comfort on the little farm which they proposed to make. They discussed the comparative advantages of one place over another. Over the mountains and on the waters of the Ohio, or the Mississipi, their imaginations painted a rich country, fertile and cheap land, an unbounded stretch of forest, tranquillity, retirement, and repose, which they thought would be nearest like their condition on the island. Mr. Clenning saw affection and hope written in letters of gold on the polished brow of his wife, and was satisfied that in love for him, she was compensated for all the privations which it had brought upon her. Augusta grew in beauty, strength, and endearment. Rescue cared for nothing, so that she saw her master and mistress happy, and could talk about the western woods. These delightful feelings of confidence and affection wore away the time pleasantly. It was little to them, whether the rest of their fellow passengers regarded them with respect or pity, which they sometimes affected to feel for them, or whether they regarded them at all. In twenty-two days, they landed without accident, at New York. Mr. Clenning had talked so much of the glorious freedom and independence of his country, and had drawn such delightful contrasts in its favour, compared with England, and they had so often meditated upon its green fields, compared with the gloomy brick walls and dark alleys of London, that when they came in view of the delightful shores of Long Island, and the beautiful environs of New York, Mrs. Clenning viewed the scenery with unsated admiration. As she surveyed from the deck the great extent of this very considerable pattern of London, she could not withhold the expression of her surprise and astonishment. She admitted, that she had never seen any thing so beautiful as the approaches to that city from the sea; and she pronounced the aspect, so seen, when all the environs were in the full splendour of summer verdure, unrivalled. While she was calmly surveying the scenery, a very different order of sensations was passing in the bosom of her husband. All his desires were concentered in the single wish, to appear well in the eyes of his wife. He often had flattered himself, that he had subdued all the weak or tormenting passions and inclinations of his nature. But, like the crop of weeds in a fertile garden in summer, as soon as one set was got under, a new one sprung up that required a new series of efforts to subdue them. He had imagined that he was neither weak, vain nor proud, like other men. But when the ship drew towards the shore, he felt a host of torturing thoughts spring up like fiends within him. The beauty and rank of his wife, assumed a new aspect in his eye. He seemed to see, for the first time, from what sphere she had descended to connect her destinies with his, and his heart inly pined for some kind of notice or distinction, on the shore of his own native country, that might enable him to figure with some degree of consequence in her eye. The little world of the respect, as well as affection of his wife, was all the world to him, as much as universal conquest would have been to Napoleon. But alas! they landed in a great and crowded city, to which they had all been looking forward with eager anticipation, and which he had fondly and proudly associated with the increasing splendour and glory of his dear native land, and he felt a painful humiliation in the thought, that amidst the crowds of people, that thronged about them and in the city, whence he had embarked to go abroad, he found himself, and was seen of her, entirely a stranger, unknown and without name, estimation or place, as completely as amidst the crowds of London, or Sidney Cove. To find himself so entirely without a single person to whom to speak, or with whom to claim recognition, was sufficiently painful in itself. It was doubly so, when contemplated by another whose respect and affection were every thing to him. Ah! thought he, before any one shall reproach me for the folly of this kind of ambition, let him be placed in my situation; let him have been the cause of humiliation to one so dear; let him return with a heart of unutterable affection to the land of his birth; let him see the crowds rushing about a landing ship; let him find himself wholly unknown, overlooked, disregarded, obliged to clear the way for strangers on this side, only to jostle them on the other; and let all this be seen by such a wife as Augusta Clenning; VOL. II.—11 and if he do not painfully feel, that man is naturally an ambitious animal, he has more meekness and philosophy, than I have. It was, indeed, a sore evil under the sun. Acquaintances, relatives, strangers, came like a torrent round the ship. There was the New York great man, making his joyful and proud recognition of his London friend. There was the bluff and portly merchant, for whom the crowd instinctively made way, that he might look at his bales. There was the honourable Mr. A. and Mr. alderman B. and squire C; and there was shaking of hands, and such hearty inquiries about the voyage, and such laying out of dinner parties; and every one but themselves, seeming to have some consequence, that the whole taken together, could not but force upon them a painful conviction of their nothingness. The people whispered, indeed, as they saw Augusta calmly sitting in the pride of her beauty. The inaudible inquiry was followed by a nod, which being interpreted, her husband understood to mean O! poor woman! It is true, some considerate visitor to the ship, brought chesnuts and cakes to the little Augusta, attracted by her sweet rosy face, and her blond locks curling round her alabaster neck. A present of this sort, and apples and oranges by another, and being caressed and kissed by a third, made the child as happy as she could be, and gave the mother favourable impressions of the kindness of heart of the American people. Besides, circumstances soon convinced Mr. Clenning, that all these painful feelings of obscurity and neglect existed alone in his mind; and that a very different train of thought from that, which he had so gloomily imagined, had been passing in hers. Perfectly secure in the sense of his protection, and satisfied in the singleness of her affection for him, her thoughts had been expatiating in the new scene before her, with all the eagerness of curiosity. Here, there were no contemptuous relatives and connections of former days, to neglect her. No harrowing associations, to remind her of the difference, between what she then was, and what she had been. She thought with pride, that her husband would see none more beautiful than herself, among his fair country-women. She was meditating with admiration on the beauty of her little girl; or thinking of the pleasure of journeying amidst new scenery; and not one of those torturing thoughts, that had brought gloom on the brow of her husband, had touched her heart. Her husband proposed a carriage to carry her and his little one, and Rescue, to the hotel. But, she kindly refused, saying, “that it was cheaper to walk; and that she wished to explore the streets, and amuse herself in surveying the busy and novel scene. Rescue bounded along with little Augusta in her arms, exulting in the thought, that in a few days more she should be in the woods. How certain it is, that most of our miseries are of our own creation! All this inward torture of ambition and pining through want of consequence, had been the single heritage of Mr. Clenning, who imagined the while, that disinterested feeling for another had originated the whole. The kind captain, true to all he had promised, proffered endorsement to the amount of a thousand dollars, of which Mr. Clenning assured him he would thankfully avail himself, whenever he could find in the country such a place as he should like to purchase. The other passengers made their cold congés, and were dispersing in their coaches to the hotels, or their different residences. Mr. Clenning and his wife, having fixed upon the hotel where they proposed to stay, were traversing the streets with that peculiar kind of inspection, which always designates strangers to citizens. The grace and foreign air of Augusta were calculated to arrest attention. Still more so were the hair, the outlandish face, and the peculiar form of Rescue. The knowing observers, who saw this singular group passing along the streets, of course noted them as persons afflicted with the sad disease of poverty, and that circumstance generally represses all interest to inquire farther. In their way to the hotel, they most fortunately stumbled upon the minister of Mr. Clenning's native village. What a meeting was this! All the feelings of home rushed upon his heart in a moment. It was with inexpressible delight he heard that his father's family were all in health. The minister was a dignified and respectable man. He was in the city, with two of his church officers, in the discharge of his ecclesiastical duties. Mr. Clenning had always been a favourite with him, and he now enjoyed this happy meeting from a variety of considerations. Augusta saw, in a moment, that the minister was a gentleman of amiable and polished manners, while her grace and sweetness struck him in such a way, as immediately to produce that winning deference and respect, which are so pleasant to those who have been born and reared in good society. She saw, in a moment, that a gentleman of such tact and manners could not belong to a country so rude and barbarous as she had thought the interior of the United States to be. A mutual feeling of regard and good will was the immediate result of this introduction. The minister and his friends were exceedingly anxious to hear the relation of his strange adventures, and the circumstances of his union with his wife. This would happily fill up the hours 11* of their residence together in the city, and of their journey, which, they agreed, should also be together, to Mr. Clenning's place of nativity. They were thus immediately associated with respectable people, who were the medium of introducing them to other respectable people, and Augusta soon observed, with visible satisfaction, the greater equality of rank and condition, and that the terms of admission to good society were more simply founded on goodness of moral character than in her own country. In company with these acquaintances they made the circuit of the town, and Augusta never ceased to express her astonishment at the display of wealth, bustle, and business, and appearances so very different from all that she had expected to find in such a young country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “Where liberty dwells there is my country.” When they left New York for Lake Champlain, it was the middle of May and deep spring; and that spring was as green, as pleasant, as perfumed, as blossom-decked, and as splendidly dressed a personage as poets have represented her. The vendure and the landscape were neither of the tropical richness and grandeur of the South Sea islands, nor yet the deep and unvarying verdure that clothes the sod amidst the chill airs and dark sky of England. This verdure was healthful, fresh, cheerful, and united the happiest tints of both the other extremes. Mr. Clenning remarked, with new sensibility, that his wife, notwithstanding all the depressing anxieties that must crowd on her mind in relation to the future, had native enthusiasm, genius, and admiration for natural beauty and grandeur. Her eye kindled as their splendid steamboat swept majestically along the bay, and up the handsomest river in the world. In passing the highlands, she never tired in looking upon this sublime river scenery, the numerous sails, all scudding on their courses, the frequent steamboats gliding by them, the appearance of bustle and life all around, the proud triumphs of art in the noble boat, that mounted the stream with her untiring and self-derived power; the towering and precipitous hills, summit beyond summit; the green vales reposing between the noble seats, marking the contrast with their embowering verdure, by their white fronts, and spires and farm houses, the abodes of rural competence and comfort; the masses of well-dressed passengers, the young, opulent and beautiful, walking on the decks of the noble passing steamboats, apparently as fine and as merry as the spring birds. Mr. Clenning looked at the enthusiastic and delighted contemplation of his wife as they were propelled rapidly up this noble stream, and especially as they passed West Point. Her eye brightened with new admiration. Her language in describing her enjoyment, and in painting the impressions which she derived from the scenery, was embodied in the very conceptions of poetry. But, alas! thought he, this world was made for Cæsar, and not for the unhappy fortune-stinted beings who have cultivated the endowment of keen sensibilities, and those vivid perceptions, which equally expand with pleasure and shrink with pain, and who have neither money, nor that kind of fame which brings the value of money. Amidst a landscape so splendid, and, to her, striking, from its freshness of novelty; amidst this scene of surpassing vernal richness, in this new and delightful way of passing in an Adriatic palace, breasting the stream, gay with its streamers and pennons of pride; amidst a crowd of passengers, all either possessing or counterfeiting the semblance of opulence, and seeming to have no pursuit on the earth, but that of Leviathans in the sea, to “take their sport therein;” amidst a multitude of their fellow beings, who, to their sensitive apprehensions, looked as if they were scrutinizing the beautiful Augusta and her charming child, and her wild and gigantic Rescue, and the thought-marked and sun-stricken countenance of her husband, only to espy the nakedness of the land; all this charm of travelling, so delightful to those who felt that they had plenty of money, and could afford to give up their minds to enjoyment, was, to them, little better than a heart wearing business of calculation—five dollars to this point, six dollars to that, and fifty dollars in the whole to that beautiful headland, fading away in the distance. Nor could he avoid the distressing calculation, at such a place I shall have but so much, and at another, a sum still more diminutive. All this, too, was so indispensable to furnish an ark, an asylum, food and raiment, even the most common and unexpensive, for those dearer to him than life. How often did the taper fingers, the slender and delicate hand, the fragile frame, and the fair person, which seemed to have been formed not to be visited too roughly by the winds, remind him in his wife, as she sat apart and pensive, apparently engaged in contrast of her own condition with the gay and unthinking proud ones about her, bring to his mind the bitter thought of the sphere from which he had caused her to fall! Travelling, thought he, is a pleasure, which none can afford to enjoy, but the rich. To those who are poor, this necessary arithmetic of calculation, this tenacious memory of those who provide the comforts and accommodations of transport is indeed a “sore evil under the sun.” Along with these painful circumstances, it was a pleasant one, that the amiable minister, and his church officers, were in company. They were deemed respectable, as characters whose place in society was well known. The respect which they exemplified in their deportment, won that of the passengers in general, and soothed and kept this family in countenance. The minister was a person of great dignity of appearance. He had a fine silver voice, poetic diction, and that kind of mélange of religion and sentiment which is generally so attractive to ladies. The liking between him and Mrs. Clenning was mutual. He was a man of sufficient tact and feeling to value her taste, and to feel the influence of her refined manners. The church officers on the other hand, felt the influence of something like restraint and awe in her presence, and they ascribed these feelings to the effect of supposed pride in her; and they mutually discussed and settled her as a woman doomed to the united misery of poverty and pride in this life, and to final and hopeless misery in the life to come. They pitied their fellow townsman, as a man who had been led away by his fancy, to marry a lady with no portion, but a beautiful face and a plentiful stock of poverty and pride, of which they good-naturedly remarked, there was already plenty at home. Much as they talked of spiritual mindedness, and having the world, as they phrased it, under their feet, and their affections simply on things above, could they have been informed what offers Mr. Clenning had slighted to retain this incumbrance, their contempt no doubt would have been greater still. It is not at all improbable that they would have found him guilty of the still higher offence of withholding a daughter from her father. In short, they were saints at particular times and places; and during the six days for work and calculation, they were shrewd, worldly wise men, who valued a man by his ready money, and by his credit in bank. The minister readily apprehended this estimate of things and dared not manifest all his kindness of feeling towards this family in presence of these men. To make amends, he unbosomed himself to them in private, and gave them a pledge that he would use all his influence in favour of them, in his native town. At Albany they shifted from the steamboat to the stage, for the magnificent Champlain canal was not then in operation. The rural and charming ride through the country to Mr. Clenning's native village, caused the eyes of Rescue to sparkle with something of their wonted brightness when in her native island. Here were hills, valleys, springs, rivers, woods, and enough of the original features of nature in her unspoiled freshness, to kindle in her bosom the dormant instincts and associations of her native country They were cheered and happy; and among their enjoyments, none were more prominent than the delighted prattle of the young Augusta, charmed with seeing the lambs play, and asking a thousand questions about the new objects that every moment met her eye. At length, from afar, the eye of Mr. Clenning caught the spire of Whitehall, and the beautiful sleeping waters of his native lake. There reposed the silver flood in its grand vase and verdant mountains. How his heart bounded at the view! “There,” said he, “dear Augusta, is the humble home where I was born. You will not think the less of me because you will find that I first saw the light in a cottage. How far we have wandered! How much we have suffered! What a strange fate has united us! We are poor; but with innocence and love, we can be happy in enjoyments which are beyond the reach of fortune. She responded by a smile of affection and confidence, that said more than a volume of professions; and he relapsed to his musings, as the stage carried them into the village. What a crowd of recollections rushed upon him! How soothing the remembrance of youthful anticipations and enjoyments, retraced by memory! Infancy with its peculiar enchantments; childhood with its simple meditations and dawning passions; manhood with its sturdier purposes, more earnest passions, and its keener perception of the sad reality of things, its blasted hopes and disappointed ambition—all these at once crowded on his mind like the images, at once distinct and blended, of a long dream. The wastes of ocean, over which he had been wafted; the perils of the deep that he had encountered and escaped; the various difficulties through which he had passed; the lovely woman, with an aspect and manner at once so frail, foreign, and different from the colour of his lot; the beautiful child beside him; the strange inhabitant of the South Seas brought here among the Green mountains—these were strange contrasts to bring back to the peaceful, humble, and laborious sphere of his birth. As they drew near the house where the stage VOL. II.—12 was to leave them, Augusta comprehending, from the thoughtfulness on his brow, some of the bitter fancies that he was chewing, handed him Augusta to kiss, and pressing his hand, she said, “My dear Arthur, your people are my people. Your home is my home, and where thou diest, there also will I die. Be assured, even in thought, I never separate you from all my pride and respect. That pride to which you have more than once alluded, is subdued, and subdued for ever. I am practically taught that there is no one thing worth living for, but domestic affection and happiness. Smooth your brow, I beseech you. I should neither love nor respect you more, if you were carrying me to a palace. This is a good country. Everything here tends to inspire self-respect. I have proved to you, little promise as my appearance might seem to give, that I know how to labour, be contented and happy. We lived in London in contented industry. We will so live here. Fear nothing. Only let me see you cheerful and tranquil, and every thing will go well.” Rescue added, “Yes, massee, me work so hard, only let me see massee look as he used to look on the island.” This is the family secret of philosophy—to banish despondency and enkindle those purposes of cheerful and confiding industry, which are worth the proceeds of the mines. But after all, when Mr. Clenning stopped at the paternal door, he was obliged to pay the tribute to poor human nature. He was compelled to admit, that unequal alliances are “a sore evil under the sun.” He was constrained to allow the wisdom and justice of that order of society, which brings equals together, and tends to raise difficulties in the way of incompatible and unequal unions. He knew that, not an hour after their arrival would elapse; the joyful greetings would be scarcely past; the hair-breadth escapes only touched upon, before there would be mental calculations within, touching the difficulty of lodging, feeding and accommodating, such an additional number of people in their family. Let those, who know how to sound the sources of bitterness in the human heart, imagine what he felt from these mingled sensations, as they knocked at the door, and were admitted. The family poured upon them, and the good father and mother embraced their lost, and returned son, in the fullness of unrestrained parental affection. Nothing could exceed the kindness and joy of the whole family. The brothers and sisters, seemed to have imbibed an uncommon portion of feeling and hilarity. In a few hours, the house was crowded with visitors, who had come to hear the strange tale, and see the strange sight. Even the maiden aunt broke the ice about the fountains of her feeling, and whispered madam Clenning the elder, that Arthur's wife was real nobility every inch, and would be an infinite honour to the family; and that to put every thing in a proper train to meet the new expenses, she would break in a few dollars upon her precious annuity. Rescue saw by a glance of the eye how the land lay, and, after the first two hours of narrative—in which she carried on a clever little episode of her own to her own listening audience—she was in the kitchen, giving abundant demonstrations, that she was handy at all the preparations for supper. They supped in plenty, and talked to a crowded audience, until midnight. In short, the reception was infinitely more cordial, and went off far better, than the fears of the returned son had anticipated. But the raptures of the return could last but for a few days. The story was soon an old one. The congratulations of the villagers were over. The united family had taken a kind of thanks-giving tea-party, with all the families of the village. The effervescence of the adventure began to subside. Former relations began to exercise their wonted influence. All parties had had time to breathe, and settle their estimate of Mr. Clenning's lady. It would be, if not an amusing, at least an instructive, though it might be a long and a tedious chapter, to give here all the comments, by the most considerable people in the village, upon the character and deservings of Mrs. Clenning. In the narrative of their fortunes, her husband, from self-respect, had necessarily left a degree of ambiguity about the relation between her and her father, though it was sufficiently understood, that she had no expectations of property, from that quarter. A hundred solutions of this mystery had been attempted. A thousand poetical inventions, each more extravagant and unjust than the other, were put in circulation, and there was abundant food for gossip in every family. It is an unhappy fact to record of human nature, that, although they had little more than conjecture to go upon, most of these fictions were exceedingly unfavourable to the party interested. Every pretty girl in the village, felt that her beauty, if not a crime, was a provoking fault. Every would be fine lady found her native grace and elegance of manners, an arrogant assumption. Her white hands and her delicate person, were scanned in no favourable point of light; and there was a general and quiet exultation at the close of the comment, which amounted to a feeling of pleasure, that madam, with her lady airs and fine form, would have to come to hard work. There were not wanting mothers with pretty daughters, who could see no beauty in her daughter; and then, what a fright was their poor slave! They generally agreed, that every rule of benevolence called upon them to instruct her 12* that she was free; and to invite her to leave a service, into which, they did not doubt, she was beguiled or compelled. It is a painful and humiliating view of human nature, that when we have no grounds on which to judge, we are much more prone to form harsh and unfavourable estimates of character, than the reverse. Mr. Clenning soon after their arrival, had a conversation with his mother upon the subject. She admitted, that if beauty were the first point in a wife, her son had made an admirable choice. “But,” she continued, “what is the use of beauty here? It is well enough to be comely, and not particularly ugly. But, where is the use of being handsomer than your sisters? But, indeed, Arthur, you were always a fine looking boy yourself, and foolishly nice in your notions of beauty in others. See, what comes of it. Will the fine looks and grand carriage of your wife clothe your children, build you a house, or buy bread for you: What are you going to do with her beauty and high birth here? She cannot, that I can discover, do any sort of house work, and you know, Arthur, we have no money to maintain fine ladies with. High birth is a good thing, and I imagine, we are as well born as she is—but your sisters will never labour to maintain a fine lady in idleness. Poor Arthur, I fear you have made a very foolish bargain. What a different match I could have made for you at home. I hoped you would have made not only your fortune, but all the rest of us rich. Instead of that, you have returned as poor as you went, and have brought back a fine lady into the bargain.” This was indeed a harsh lecture to her son; but he knew, that it was dictated by sincerity and good intention, if not cheering views of his case. He answered, and it was all the answer which the case admitted, that all this information, however wise and useful it might have been before the fatal knot was tied, was wholly useless now, since it could not in the slightest degree operate upon the past; but, he added, that it was due to truth, as well as his wife, to add, that if the greatest fortune in the world were put into the hands of any other woman, and he was sure, she would share it with him, and his choice were again to be made, he would again select his dear lang syne, were she as pennyless, as when they united their affections on the island. To this she replied, that the Clennings had always been a wilful race; that love would go where it would; that the Clennings had been constantly sliding down hill, for four generations, and that this useless flounce of finery stitched on to their family garment, she thought, would do little to help the cause; that, “as he had brewed, so he must bake:” adding a very respectable string of proverbs, after the fashion of Sancho, all tending to illustrate the folly of her son's choice. Something was to be done. Mrs. Clenning was a woman too charming, intelligent, and, we must add the word, too fashionable, not to excite a great deal of envy, and ill feeling, and ill natured remark, in the village. It would be well if we were not obliged to add, that there was envy towards her in her husband's own family. Her husband's sisters complained of having to attend upon a lady. The maiden aunt found fault with her small hand, and the lilies and roses in her cheeks. All this she well understood, and the rising of her father's spirit within, at times almost suppressed her breath. But, she had learned practical calmness and self-possession, in the school of adversity. She suppressed resentful thoughts as they arose; kept as much to herself as possible; and made no mean attempts to conciliate her sisters-in-law, doing them little kindnesses in relation to their finery, which subdued their envious feelings against themselves. Through the whole of the trial, she maintained a calm placidity of spirit; but she prayed earnestly, that Providence would make known some way, in which, by honest industry, they could be independent without causing her continued humiliation, or the necessity of much intercourse with people who slandered and envied her. Mr. Clenning was aware, that as soon as things should have found their ancient bearings in the family, and the first flow of kind feeling, created by his return should have worn away, and the thoughts of the family should have resumed their ancient channel, they would begin to manifest a disposition to get rid of him, as a burden upon them. He knew too, that the less a man needs kindness and sustenance, the more ready people are to bestow it upon him, and the reverse. As soon, then, as he began to hear insinuations about the smallness of the house, and the expensiveness of living, and indirect questions, how he intended to dispose of himself and his lady wife for the future, he gave them to understand, that he had nearly sixteen hundred dollars in possession, and a thousand more at command, when he chose to order it. Never had information such an electric and transforming effect. The pennyless dead-weight member of the family, with a fair wife for a negative sign in algebra, became transformed in a moment into a man of consequence. An industrious and frugal man, with that amount of money, they declared a rich man. Why had he deceived them, by making up a face of poverty? For that sum he could purchase two sections of land in the western country, build a good house, and stock his farm. He passed at once, in the view of the family, from humiliation to exaltation. The sisters-in-law made respectful courtesies to their lady sister-in-law. The news moved in the village. The airs and dresses of Mrs. Clenning seemed now fashionable, and matters well worth being copied. Some friends began to stir themselves in his behalf. The post-office was vacant by the death of the late incumbent, and the income was four hundred dollars. The house in which the post-office was kept, a beautiful white cottage on the shore of the lake was to be rented. Interest was made that he should be appointed. On enquiry he learned that there were no more than thirty-six applications for it. He was advised to repair to Mr. M. member from the district in congress, a man who had obtained his place by crouching and purring to the people in the first instance, who was alternately a toad eater to the great, and a tyrant to the small—a union much more common, than is generally imagined. Mr. Clenning wished his interest with the post-mastergeneral. This little great man received him as a Mandarin of the blue button, and drew himself up in his chair. “Sir, what are your pretensions?” Mr. Clenning's voice clung to his jaws. “I repeat, sir,” said the great man, “what are your pretensions? Before the respondent could answer, there came in one of those clever fellows, who, like the engineer of a steamboat, keep the electioneering machine in operation. The lion to Mr. Clenning, instantly became a spaniel to this mover of the sovereign people. Undoubtedly the disclosures were of a nature unfit for unhallowed ears. So, requesting Mr. Clenning to remain, they retired and were closeted. When he returned, the member was a great man again, and resumed the question, What were Mr. Clenning's pretensions? The latter suggested that he was a good penman, accountant and so forth; the only qualifications which he supposed important, after integrity, in a post-master. He showed a beautiful specimen of his penmanship. “Oh, that is all well!” replied the great man, “every one is a scholar in these times. That is nothing. There are thirty-six applicants, sir. Every one writes a good hand, and moreover, every one of them has a father, or a brother, and a circle of friends. This man's father was a revolutionary officer. That man is nephew to Gov. L. A third has a sister that married judge R. who has great influence in S.” In this way he run through the value and pretensions of each one of the thirty-six applicants. “A thing, sir,” said he, “is worth what it will bring in the market. Now let us compare your pretensions. The Clennings have some influence, not much, however. Can you make a speech, such as we hear now in Congress? Do you know how to tickle the people? Can you electioneer? Can you lie? Can you write?” Mr. Clenning replied, that he respected himself and the people too much, to think of any thing of the kind. “Then, sir, you are not the man for a post-master. There is influence in it. We give and take, sir. We do for you. You must do for us.” The question finally turned upon his capability at writing, and he showed Mr. Clenning a most abusive electioneering article in the newspaper, traducing an important public functionary, and lauding a candidate intended to supplant him. “What think you of that, sir? Can you match it?” Mr. Clenning answered, that he saw nothing difficult in writing it, for that of all writing, such kind of abuse was the easiest; and that a wooden writen might be easily invented, to utter as good; but that a man, who was either an honest man or a gentleman, could never condescend to use such language for any person, or with any inducement. This clenched the nail. “Oh, sir,” said the great man, “I beg your pardon. I perceive you have honesty, and a conscience, and are scrupulous. Sir, all this is teeth outwards, and for the people. You will soon find, that this is not the kind of qualification for a post-master's place, for which there are thirty-six applications. You had better consult the minister, sir. He, too, talks about a conscience. You must excuse me. We are busy in preparing for the electioneering campaign. I shall be glad to serve you in any other way.” Mr. Clenning, equally in disappointment and disgust, turned away. “This is a hard world,” said he, “but I must try it again.” He passed the beautiful place, which he described, on his way back again. Its bignonias and honey-suckles were unfolded in all their splendour, and the gentle ripples of the lake lulled at the foot of the garden. He had been flattered that the great man would help him to this sweet place, and that he would create an agreeable surprise for his wife, by imparting the good news in the first instance himself. It went to his heart, to see her fair face beginning to be sicklied over with the cast of anxiety and care. What a delightful thought would it have been, to have told her, that this charming place between the mountains and the lake was hers! The place looked more provokingly pleasant, in passing it now in the hour of his disappointment, than it had ever done before. He took the ironical advice of the great man, and repaired to the minister, and laid his difficulties before him. He was not a little piqued by the reference of the congressman to him, and he probably served Mr. Clenning from motives compounded partly of temper, and partly of benevolence. The effect was, that he served him heartily. The minister was fourth cousin to Mr. C. of New York, and was allowed the privilege of intimacy with that distinguished man. VOL. II.—13 That man was to the member whom he had consulted, as Opperbanjo, in Japan, is to Banjo. The one was a very great man, and the other only a great man. The minister wrote for him, staking all his influence. In a few days, Mr. Clenning received an answer from him, that he would exert his influence with the postmaster general. As soon as the mail could return from Washington the appointment arrived. When the announcement was made to Augusta, the father, the mother, the child, and Rescue, were, probably, for the time being, the happiest people in the world. Embraces, and tears of affection and joy were not wanting. This would banish the grim spectre of poverty for a while, and until they could procure a farm, which was their ultimate purpose. They both alike despised the miserable dependence upon favour and office as a final reliance for their domestic arrangements. The name of postmaster, too, gratified some of the English feelings of his wife. Such is human nature, that every one sees their nearest and most intimate friend, when that friend has recently received a place of trust and value, as the ancient poets imagined the aspect of shades— something larger than life. In truth, there was something singularly bland and soothing in her caresses and congratulations, as she allowed that a great man was a great man in America, and England, and all the world over. This good fortune, along with other circumstances, placed them at once on the dizzying pinnacles of good society in the village. The grand presentation of a stranger in a country village at the north, is the appearance of the personage at church on the Sabbath. Mr. Clenning's family took a pew, made themselves as fine as they could, and made their entré at church the first Sabbath after this appointment. Let them talk about the throbbings of heart on being introduced at court, or making the maiden speech in congress hall, or delivering a fourth of July oration, or any other gridiron experiment that can be proposed. They are all a sham, a terrific man of straw, compared with the making entré into a full village church on a Sabbath day, after the services have commenced. There is such a blaze of simple beauty! There is so much majesty in the gray patriarchal heads and the pondrous canes of the ancient tenants of the body seats! The religious solemnity and stillness are so imposing! There is such a sanctity in the dignity annexed by opinion to the grand but unostentatious part of the minister! When a strange family, like that of Mr. Clenning's enters, there is such a consentaneous movement of heads, such a rustling of gowns, such a rattling of the little falling trap tables, so conveniently devised either as an asylum for the head for profound meditation or a profound nap! Instead of all the incense of an oriental sacrifice, or the aromatic fragrance of drugs from Araby the blest, the church is filled with the more delicious odours of the northern pond-lily. There is no place, no union of circumstances of interest, no delightful and hallowed associations that may not be found in a northern church on a fine spring Sabbath. Mr. Clenning was ready for this solemn affair in good season, and begged Augusta to be also in season. But this is a domestic impossibility never to be remedied. He fidgetted, and showed his impatience, as the bell began to ring. Augusta blushed, became a little nervous, and probably thought her husband, for that time, in bad temper, but did not nevertheless remit adding one touch of finish to her own dress, and that of her beautiful and fairy-like daughter. Rescue, too, was awful in no small blaze of savage finery. All these preparations were not completed until fifteen minutes after the bell had ceased to be heard. The clear and mellow voice of the minister reading the hymn, echoed from the walls, as they entered. Their pew was near the pulpit. The church was an oblong square. Amidst a mass of people as close as they could be compacted into their pews, this strange procession walked along the aisle. One would have thought there was but one soul and one neck to a thousand people. Such a rustling! such an excitement of the moved fragrance of the pond-lily. Every eye was on them. The poor minister might get the attention of whom he could. Some smiled. Some blushed. Some envied, and all supposed that they had come at that time merely to excite observation. Mr. Clenning, who knew the estimate of the audience, could have sunk to the earth to avoid observation. Not so Augusta. She was perfectly calm and at home in all this attention. It excited, in fact, the pleased consciousness that it was all her due, and it reproduced the momentary complacency of gone by days. It would be no useless nor uninteresting history to recite the various incidents, estimates, greetings, and management, through which they had to pass, in taking their place, and finding their level in the society of the village. A fair history of the society of a country village would be a thousand times more interesting than a novel; and besides the interest of the picture, it would be one of the most useful views of society that can be presented. But taste has not yet matured sufficiently to relish such a picture, and, perhaps, the historian does not yet exist who has the requisite discrimination and felicity to draw it. The actings of concentred ambition, self-importance, scandal, envy, and ill-feeling, which in a city, operate over a wide mass, and are spread through such a variety of interest and feeling, are all concentred in the village; with the added 13* disadvantages against it, that in the city, rank, place, standing, estimation, society, and all the incidental circumstances of intercourse, have been arranged by prescription, and every one naturally settles into the niche which he is destined to fill. Far otherwise in the village. Prescription has settled nothing. There is at once an union and distinction, an equality and inequality, which are always varying. All the elements of pride, vanity, and envy, are at all times in a state of chaos and confusion. Storms are always fermenting. Mr. Clenning had returned to the society of his native village, under circumstances which naturally raised him from the place occupied by his father's family. It was in vain by humility, and gentleness, and courtesy to them, that he endeavoured to keep this truth out of sight. He soon found, that in discussing him and his family, his foes were those of his own household. A large proportion of the villagers soon found him, as they said, insupportably proud, and that he felt himself rising too rapidly in his business. A defeated expectant of the place of postmaster started a party against him. A paper was soon handed round for subscribers to a memorial to the postmaster general, to dismiss him for maladministration. But the continued to wax great, notwithstanding all these efforts. As a proof of this, he received an appointment of justice of the peace; and Augusta had the satisfaction to see every letter addressed to her husband by the title of Esquire. Upon receiving this appointment, he was notified by those friends who procured it for him, that it was expected he would give a dinner in consequence. Accordingly, to fulfil all righteousness, and moreover to gratify his wife, he consented to give a dinner. It was intended to unite the fancy, wit, and judgment of both, to show how much they could do with a small sum. It was a hard science for Augusta, who had studied arrangements only in the midst of opulence. But when this problem was settled, there was another of still harder demonstration before them; and that was, so to distribute the cards of invitation, where every body could not be invited, so as to give no offence to those who were omitted. They were warned upon this subject; but, like most others who have tried the thing for the first time, apprehended no danger. On the contrary, Mrs. Clenning was sure that she could so manage it, as to put down the ill feeling, which, she knew, existed in reference to them in the village. But, alas for her knowledge for managing a village, they found that they offended many, and pleased none! Some envied the practised ease and dignity of Mrs. Clenning's deportment. Some cried out upon the extravagance of such poor beginners in making such a show. Others ridiculed and analysed the points of show, and discussed the meagreness and cheapness of the reality from which the appearance was compounded. Those who were invited, considered that they had done no more than their duty, and felt no obligation restraining them from joining in the ridicule with the rest. Every one that had not been included in the invitation considered the omission as a pointed mark of indignity, and resented it accordingly. Augusta was chagrined, and a little inclined to scold at the country. Her husband complacently advised her to take it all calmly, as one of the miseries of human life, and assured her that he had no idea that in an English village the same thing would have been conducted to a happier issue. But these evils, met by a calm and forbearing temper, soon cured themselves. Envy and babble and ill-feeling soon burnt out their own fires. The pleasant and intelligent people, by a principle of electric attraction, soon began to attach themselves to them, and they found themselves settling into the bosom of a friendly and assorted circle. They had passed through all the seven purgatories of scandal. Augusta had successively risen from being a woman of ill-fame, a transported convict, to being a runaway and disinherited heiress. A whole brood of rumours touching him had been hatched and extinguished. The natural order and result of moderation and correct deportment manifested itself. One report and surmise died away after another. One mouth after another was stopped, until calumny of them sunk gradually to those known calumniators, that exist in every society, whose censure, in the common phrase, is praise. Mr. Clenning had often allayed the indignant feelings of his wife, by predicting that it would be so, and that like the atmosphere after the passing thunder-cloud, the air would be more pure and calm afterwards; and that if they persisted in their moderation, they would ultimately achieve the most glorious and difficult of all triumphs, the triumph over envy. As a straw is sufficient to show the direction of the wind, one fact out of a thousand will show the spirit and temper of many people in that village, and, unhappily, in a thousand other villages. Rescue, of course, came often in contact with the good gossips of the place. Nothing pleased them more than to tell her she was a slave, and to pretend humanity and kindness in advising her to leave her mistress, and promising her countenance and protection. Said Rescue, as she related a conversation of this sort, “Do you think that Phyllis, the black woman, didn't tell me I was a slave, and that massa and missee were both bad; and that the woman where she worked didn't ask me if you didn't whip me?” “What of that?” asked her master. “What of that!” answered Rescue in astonishment, “why I beat Phyllis before her mistress, and I say, you take that. Massa and missee no bad. Me love them. Me never run away.” The kind object of these zealous efforts to emancipate poor Rescue was, as they expressed it, the hope that Mrs. Clenning might be obliged to put her own delicate fingers to the cooking. Nothing material occurred in their chapter of incidents, until the autumn, when they had a fine boy to match their Australasian daughter. Their circumstances were easy. They were growing in the respect of the people, and were perhaps as happy as man can be on the earth. But a new cause of alarm and apprehension began to rise, like a dark cloud, upon their prospects. The roses in the cheek of Augusta were replaced by lilies, and there was the calm and sad smile of one, who felt that her health was sinking. Every day of their residence together had more endeared her to her husband, as he had seen the native pride of her spirit gradually mellowing into affectionate humility, and a self-disciplined and contented temper. Home was clearly her paradise. Every thing abroad, that decorum, the usages of the society in which they lived, and the wishes of her husband called for, she meekly endured. But home was the place of her enjoyment. Never had he seen her so amiable, so delightfully kind, so considerately attentive to all the small charities that compose the comfort of home, as since the birth of her son. But as she bent over the babe with those looks of inexpressible tenderness that a mother alone can feel, it was evident that her health was sinking. There was a sombre cast in the tone of the delightful conversations, which often ensued, while with untiring tenderness he watched over her in the days of this confinement. All words would be useless to explain what he felt during the long and bitter winter that followed. The storms howled. The snow whistled, and the Spirit of ice and frost seemed to have fixed his throne on the Green Mountains. The interest, the harrowing agitation, with which he watched her countenance, and the changing aspects of her health from day to day, convinced him, but too plainly, that his life, or all that rendered it worth possessing, was involved in hers. When she saw this distress, saw that he wished to speak to her on the subject of her increasing debility, but dared not, she gently pressed his hand, assured him that all would be well on the return of the mild weather of spring, and turned the conversation to some other point. In these cases of solicitude, that agonize the heart and prey upon the mind, there is no real relief but in the inexhaustible fountains of religion. He besieged the throne of the Divine mercy, with incessant and unwearied prayer, that her illness might not be irrecoverably fixed, before the return of spring. How thankful they were to the Almighty, when the winter at length relented, and the season of buds and flowers once more returned. The physician remarked, as was obvious to them all, that the keen and bleak air of the lake, was unfavourable to her complaint, and advised them before another winter to fix themselves in a southern climate. During this terrible winter, they had a thousand times talked of the western country, of the mildness of the climate, and the repose and range of a new establishment on the prairies. Many circumstances, apart from his concern about the health of his wife, induced him to wish to remove from that village. The thirty-six applicants for his place, never forgave his success over them, and were still intriguing to remove him. They had a few neighbours, who were really amiable and affectionate, but a much greater number, who never ceased to find some harsh and ill-natured remark to make about them. If the ministers in these villages would oftener preach about the guilt and misery of the odious passions that so often prey upon the members of small societies in country villages, they might do something towards removing the evil. Mr. Clenning was weary of wandering; but he was more weary of the pitiful slander, the petty contentions, and everlasting squabbles, of the villagers. The idea of a farm in the western country, had long been treasured in his imagination. His thoughts expatiated in the deep beechen forests, or wandered over the flowery expanse of the prairies. A feeling which he should have repressed, not exactly misanthropy, but something too near like it, impelled him to wish for more solitude and a retirement from the crowded haunts of men. He had probably associated in his mind the idea of more innocence and freshness in the heart of man in those countries, with the virgin freshness of the soil; an association, which after-experience convinced him had originated in a mistaken opinion. But so it was. Fancy had spread over the picture of a residence there, all the beauty and brightness of her own creations. Added to this, it was the country to which the physicians advised him to take his wife, for her health. This circumstance fixed his purpose, and he mentioned his feelings and views upon the subject to her. The kindness of his motive affected her, but she was unwilling to part with him for the time which a journey to look at the country would require. She was entirely willing to move there whenever he saw fit to go; and she insisted, in the language of the affectionate Ruth, “when and where thou goest, I will go,” and we will make the journey together. It was not until VOL. II.—14 after long and almost painful reasonings, and statings of the necessity of the case, that he could induce her to consent to his going before, to make a purchase, should he be pleased, and prepare a place for her reception. It was one of the hardest struggles he had ever encountered, to leave his wife, still feeble and delicate, with Augusta clinging to her, and crying from sympathy, and the little Arthur in her arms. But their condition called for this parting. He went, had a prosperous journey, and the country every where seemed delightful, for he every where saw Augusta. He looked at no place, without thinking of the appearance it would make, when embellished by the presence of his wife. He finally selected a position on the rich, large and beautiful prairie, pitched upon by Mr. Birkbeck, for the purpose of making a settlement of English people. He purchased a tract of land, to which he intended to remove as soon as the summer heats were over. It was amusing when he returned, to hear the regret which the people of the village, even those who had been most liberal in their slanders, expressed at the idea of their going away. They became personages of consequence at once. The thirty-six applicants all turned about, and blew a fine gale in their sails. Poor fellows, thought Mr. Clenning, you will soon be growling at each other, like hungry dogs quarreling for a single bone. Notwithstanding all the manifestations of sorrow among the villagers at the approaching departure, the Clennings consoled themselves with the thought, that the day after they were gone, every thing would go on just as before; and the busy folks would comfort themselves for the loss, by hunting up some new game to worry. In the beautiful days of Indian summer, the journey was commenced. Every thing, bag and baggage, was packed in a monstrous Kentucky wagon, drawn by six horses. Away they went, “over the hills and far away,” to the state of Illinois. Mr. Clenning's heart was gladdened to see the health of his wife improving every day, and her mind invigorated by convalescence, exercise, and the delightful weather of this season, regained its elasticity and cheerfulness. Rescue occupied herself with the care of the children, thus relieving their mother from all the uneasiness of maternal affection, and enabling her to enjoy all its pleasures. The native of the island in the South Sea was delighted by the awakening of ancient and fond remembrances, produced by travelling through the noble forests, now wearing the mellow livery of autumn. A pleasanter period can hardly be imagined, than that which passed over the heads of this family as they made their way to their new home. Upon their arrival, Mr. Clenning was gratified to find that his wife and Rescue were as much struck with the beauty of the spot he had chosen, as he had been. Here then this family was placed in the midst of a new order of things, in the skirt of a noble forest of cotton wood, sycamores, and elms, on the margin of a plain, still covered with a waste of flowers, as rich, as primitive, and as charming as that of Mamre. The soft and whispering southwest breeze seemed to medicate the frame of Mrs. Clenning, and to confirm her convalescence. Affection, tranquillity, and contentment beamed in her eye. Could any thing have added to Mr. Clenning's affection for his wife, it would have been to see her, as he did, study her new duties, as the head of a farmer's establishment. In performing these duties, she was compelled to combat the wishes both of her husband and Rescue. But she showed them so clearly that her heart was in the point of learning to be a good housewife, and that it would add to her cheerfulness, by occupying her time when her husband should be absent, and, more than all, her confident persuasion, that this course would be serviceable to her health, that they consented, and saw her at early morn inhaling the breath of her cows, and her hundred fowls flocking around her, as her tamed birds used to do in the island. Near Mr. Clenning were two thousand acres for sale. He had a distant hope that he should yet come to his wife's rights, when he intended to purchase this, and settle all his relations around him, and become to them a sustaining Mordecai, speaking peace, and doing good to all his race. A younger brother was already with him, and more of the family talked of joining them. Mr. Clenning paid for his land, and stocked it well in comparison with his neighbours. With such a beginning, he bade fair soon to become one of the best farmers in the vicinity. A large field was shortly enclosed, and the land being perfectly smooth, without a tree or shrub, it was at once ready for the plough. Just in the edge of the prairie, and under the shade of peccans, sycamores, elms, and horse-chesnuts, Mr. Clenning built his log house. But if the reader has never been in a respectable building of this kind, he has, I dare say, very little idea what a tight, snug, and comfortable house this is. For example, there are three rooms plaistered with lime and covered with paper hangings, and for all purposes of comfort and utility, and for every object but ostentation, as good as the splendid apartments of Mr. Wellman in Grosvenor square. The cattle are turned into the range to fatten and multiply when their services are not required on the farm. A thousand fowls furnished them in a short time with a barrel of eggs. They may be said, literally, to flow with milk and honey. They raise grain in a profusion almost to make them think cheaply 14* of the staff of life. Orchards are planted out, that promise to yield every variety of apple, pear, peach, and plum, as well as to add their peculiar beauty to the landscape. In the wild fruits of the woods around, nature offers them her free luxuries, and their table, at will, is supplied with venison, wild ducks, turkeys, and the other varieties of game. Add to this picture, an air of tranquillity and repose pervading the whole scene; health, affection, content, and intelligence on the part of the indwellers, and the constant enjoyment of a mild and delightful climate, and I think, reader, you have in view as much happiness as ever falls to the lot of human nature under the sun. Their neighbours afford the Clenning's a more agreeable society than that which they had left in the village. Coming from different regions, they have seen something of the nature of man, and have been compelled to rub off some of their narrow prejudices and illiberal feelings. Among them are two foreigners, highly intelligent and respectable, whose greatness, like Mrs. Clenning's, is in an eclipse. To those who have a taste for the simple, innocent, and healthful pleasures belonging to the cultivator of the soil, it will give pleasure to hear the astonishing growth of the young orchards. In three years after transplanting, the apple-trees will bend with fruit. To one who has never seen the corn of these plains, it would be difficult to describe the grandeur of a corn field of seventy-five acres, and the wheat field of forty, in which, when full grown, a man may hide himself, as in tall bushes. Nor could any one, except by seeing it, form an idea of the beauty of the orchard of two thousand choice, grafted, and innoculated fruit trees, as it shows on the perfectly level prairie. The wheat yields forty, and the corn eighty bushels, to the acre. The cattle and pigs increase in such a proportion, that in a few years they will be able to institute a pretty respectable comparison with the man of Uz. Then, there is the handsome dearborn and horses, which enable them to take healthful and pleasant morning and evening rides. Rescue is as tall, and much fatter than formerly, and allows that Illinois beats even the island for good living. In short, from the kitchen garden to the thousand fowls, from the sheep to the pigs, from the barn to the cellar, every thing goes on as they could wish, and they are in a fair way to have all that heart can wish,—independence, abundance, healthy and beautiful children, kind neighbours, good roads, and a great and glorious country. They see from their mother earth —“Life's blessings grow,” and eat their bread in peace and privacy. The reader may perhaps think that Mr. Clenning has praised his wife too much. His extenuation, is that from what he hears he is led to believe, that every one is not as fortunate as himself, with regard to this point; and as he is so happy, and in such good temper with every living thing, as to be desirous of general happiness, he is willing that the world should have the benefit of his wife's example. That wives should be good is the more necessary, as, after all, according to the good old saw, “A man must ask his wife's leave to thrive.” If you ever cage happiness, it must be where the wife is. Mr. Clenning often consults atlasses, and globes, and navigators, and is not a little disturbed with Symmes' hole at the poles. His wife tells him, that he must have the wandering lump in his skull; but that she has surveyed their beautiful fields, springing orchards, the grand “truck-patch” of a garden, the chickens, turkies, and ducks, so often, and has enjoyed such home-felt, and undisturbed happiness here, as to prevent her mind from dwelling for a moment upon the possibility of finding a better conntry or of making a remove, before the final one. If the reader should suppose this family is lonesome, let him go and spend a night with them, and hear in the morning the chicken's crow, the turkies gobble, and the pigs squeal, not to mention the louder noises of the larger animals, in addition to the music of the groves, and he will allow that they are any thing rather than lonesome. There are two sons, besides their little Augusta, who rises “when the horn calls them out in the morn,” and walks with her father into the fields. If you would know concerning the brightness of Mrs. Clenning's eyes, dispute the point of Augusta's beauty. She has the more reason in this, as the little girl is known to all the neighbours as the “Rose of the prairie.” The parents amuse themselves with hearing the children catch the dialect of the country, so far as it is innocent. The youngest calls his sister “South Sea Islander;” and she in return denominates him “Buck-eye.” All the provincialisms in their mouths sound in the ears of the father and mother like the true pastroal Doric. The husband and wife have turned over together forty books upon education. If they could dispute upon any subject, it would be this. Mrs. Clenning thinks that her husband is a little notional upon this point, and was afraid, that between two stools, the poor things would fall to the ground; until the two came to a final agreement, that one should take the charge of them one day, and the other the next. Between both, and the rivalry they keep up to prove by experiment, which is the better instructor, the children are put on at a great pace. They keep one holiday, that is called the island feast; in which they live, as nearly as they can, after the fashion of the island; wearing the same clothes that they then wore, and relating to the astonishment and delight of the children, the account of their residence there, describing at the same time, the woods, the mountains, the seas, and the animals. As they repeat the story of the terrible affair, in which Rescue was gained, the little ones draw close to them, and look up with their little countenances full of affright and trouble, until their mother's mode of defence, and the exultation of victory brings brightness to their eyes, and smiles to their cheeks. The description of the voyage in the boat never fails to produce a burst of tears from both mother and children. Rescue sings wild songs after the mode of her country, the burden of which are the loves and wars of the islanders. Augusta's imagination is so much affected by these details, that she has selected a beautiful clump of trees, in which she is to have a grotto, and it is to be raced as her island. There is a part of this story, which, as it comes in the shape of a confession from Mr. Clenning, the reader must be lenient in judging. Mr. Clenning, ever since his marriage, had concealed at the bottom of his heart an ardent desire to become a great man, and reflect back upon his wife something of that unborrowed splendour, which she eclipsed on his account. Prompted by this feeling, as soon as he became easy in his circumstances, he commenced the career of popularity. He made himself as thick as he could at all the common places of meeting in the country, and the county towns; and he studied the little arts of ingratiating himself in the good opinion of the people, as closely as possible. He squeezed the good farmers' hands, and praised their chubby sons and daughters as far as he dared, without betraying his motive, and inquired how their cattle thrived, and how they managed their crops, and listened to the details of their affairs, apparently with great interest, at the same time that all his thoughts were a hundred miles from the matter. Economy was the burden of all his conversations with them, which were spiced with accounts of the extravagance and court airs at Washington. He took care occasionally to insinuate, that though every thing was going on wrong now, it would be the easiest thing in the world to have affairs straight, if they would have the discretion to send a certain person there. The reader will acknowledge that this has been to some purpose, when he is informed, that Mr. Clenning has been successively member of assembly, judge of the county court, bridge and canal commissioner, and speech drafter, besides having delivered two fourth of July orations, and made six stump speeches. But for a certain Quaker, he would have gone to Congress. This person's wealth is to Mr. Clenning's in the proportion of six to one. He is six feet five inches tall, and wears rich broad-cloth, cut in the Quaker fashion, to hide under this meek and modest garb avarice enough to make a Gripus, and ambition enough for a Napoleon. The old fellow has twice travelled to Washington, to get the president to let the national road pass his dwelling. He rode in style in his carriage, paid his bills on the road like a lord, and proposed his project to the president, who referred him to the secretary of war, who sent him to the board of engineers, who handed him over to the committee on roads, who referred him back again to his constituents for more documents. But as they all squeezed him by the hand, bowed civilly to him, and gave him good words, he came back the second time no ways discouraged, and fully convinced that he was a rising man at court. This man stood the poll against Mr. Clenning, and he knew all that Mr. Clenning knew about playing the amiable, and a few things more. He understood the state of the pulse of the country, and how to calculate his almanac to its meridian. He beat Mr. Clenning without succeeding himself; and, as happened to the two beasts quarrelling for the royalty, a third person, taking advantage of the disagreement, came in between them, and carried the election. Every one knows, that the winding up of a novel, bestows riches upon the hero, however poor he may have been during its progress. Although it must be evident to the reader of this book, that it is a real biography, and not like that species of useless and extravagant fiction, called novels, still it is to be feared that the following announcement may shake the faith of the reader, on this important point, because of its resemblance to the mode of managing matters in those, we had almost said, pernicious books. But the truth must be told. In the remote and peaceful log house of Mr. Clenning, on the plains of Illinois, and under the shade of the nature-planted elms, a letter was received from Grosvenor-square, London, and these were the electrifying contents: Sir,—It has become my duty, as administrator on the estates of the late Augustus Wellman, to notify you, that his daughter, your lady, has become sole heir to all his estates, real and personal. He departed this life suddenly, from gout in the stomach, this day week. We find an authenticated will, drawn up with all that precision and caution for which he was so justly celebrated. On his death-bed, he declared formally, and before sufficient witnesses, his sense of the injustice and cruelty with which he had treated his daughter and you. It appeared that a person in his employ kept up a constant and careful surveillance of your conduct and circumstances. It appears, too, that this inspection VOL. II.—15 resulted in the most advantageous estimates of you both. As an attempted, though late retribution, he has constituted her his sole heir. It is desirable that you should come, as soon as may be, to the country, and attend to the forms of taking possession on the spot, or, otherwise, to constitute some person attorney, to act with full powers in your stead. I am, &amp;c. &amp;c. The signer of this letter was a person of high standing; and the letter came with such a superfine and foreign countenance, bearing the London post-mark upon it, that it excited much notice and speculation in the post office. It had passed, no doubt, through fifty hands, had been most ingeniously broken open, and its contents inspected, and then carefully resealed. The reader will find little difficulty in conceiving all that happened in Mr. Clenning's dwelling on the arrival of this overwhelming intelligence. But it can never enjoy, as its inhabitants did, the looks and deference of their neighbours, who knew all this important business as well as they did, and to whom it was, as yet, a matter of necessity, that they should seem to know nothing about it. Their countenance and deportment said most plainly, “Sir, we know all this thing, but you must be a shrewd fellow to find out our knowledge.” The point now to settle was, going to England to take possession. Mrs. Clenning could not go; and she seemed so unwilling that her husband should leave her for the time which the journey would require, that it almost seemed as if the pain of parting would counterbalance the joy of coming to such great possessions. Mrs. Clenning advocated the sending an agent; but it was finally concluded that they owed it to their children that Mr. Clenning should attend to the business himself. As to the grief of losing such a father, it would have been gross affectation to have made much ado about it. The reflection could not but suggest itself to them, that they inherited his estates at last only because he could not carry the title papers with him. But, to be short, Mr. Clenning parted once more from his wife, and it was like being torn asunder, and away he went over the Atlantic safely, was put into full and legal possession of his property, and had ample leisure to observe what a different personage he now was from the Arthur Clenning who had formerly landed at Liverpool. He was introduced at court, kissed the king's hand, and was often assured, that no man could be so stupid, while inheriting such beautiful estates in England, as to think of returning to live in wild woods in the interior of America. His reply to these remarks was, that a greyhound loved range, and an owl deep woods and hollow trees, and a true born yankee loved nature and independence. His heart instantly associated the green plains with Augusta and his children, and he exclaimed, “Illinois for ever!” He hurried back, as fast as wind, steam, and love could carry him, to the arms of his wife, who was as kind and blooming as ever; and who, before the first burst of the joy of meeting was over, put into his arms a third boy, a fine Illinois buckeye too. Mrs. Clenning would not hear a word about going to England, although her husband described the beauty of the houses, and the extent of the parks and establishments in the most alluring style, assuring her, that if she chose to go there, he had not a word of objection. Hear her answer: “My dear Arthur,” said she, “I think that I have obtained a complete and final triumph over my pride. But I have so studied the heart, that I am perfectly aware of the deep necessity of that petition, `Lead us not into temptation.' I am now tranquil, quiet, contented. I enjoy entire peace of mind, and that is worth more than a million. Who knows if I were to return to the splendour and the idle show of life, but these extinct passions might kindle again from under their ashes? I have become broken to the ways of your people. These woods are worth all the parks on the globe. I like the people, the country, the climate, the laws, the equality, the independence, and plenty; and I never wish to be a fine lady again, or to be admired by any body but my own Arthur. We will have good masters. My dear little Augusta shall learn music, dancing, French, and all accomplishments of that character of others; but to be amiable, wise, and good, she and the rest, Arthur, shall learn of you and me. There is no education like a domestic one; no teachers that can vie with a father and mother. To instruct our children shall be our employment, our pleasure, and our pride; and they shall repay us in our age.” “But where shall we find a husband for Augusta?” said Mr. Clenning. “Some sensible, modest, well-educated yankee,” was the reply. “He is the man for my daughter and my money. But at any rate, we will rear her to be a prize to a good husband, and God will provide.” And now, if Mr. Clenning chooses to stand again for congress, let his competitors, the old Quaker among the rest, look to it. He can knock open a barrel of whiskey, as easily as any of them, although he has some scruples and doubts whether he shall take that method of getting along. The truth is, he went to Washington to inspect the premises, by way of foretaste: On his return he told his wife, that it was an everlasting and long-winded establishment; that, as he was never strong at the lungs, it actually made him short breathed, to hear a famous speaker spout. He heard the moving speeches, that moved all the audience, but toad-eaters and persons directly interested, from the house. He saw, too, with what a philosophic air of patience and resignation the members drew themselves up, to endure, with proper unction and profit, the penance of hearing a heavy speaker gleaning the shreds and gilt paper out of forty preceding speeches, and talking three hours on a tack about nothing. He admitted, that it was a striking exhibition of a seventy horse power of talking and legislation, and that there was something imposing in the puffing of the steam and the whirling of the wheels, and that was all there was in the sight. He feared that he would not be able to exercise the graces of patience and resignation necessary for a listener; and, however desirable those virtues might be for his fellow beings, he did not consider himself called in Providence to improve them in that way. His wife and neighbours admit, that he can be a great man whenever he chooses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POSTSCRIPT. The Clennings have six fine farms in sight of Arthur Clenning, who lives in the midst of them, and is called “the king of the Clennings.” Augusta is twelve years old, and as beautiful as her mother, which is saying a great deal. Her father has in his eye a fine modest lad of sixteen, who talks and acts already like a sage, and blushes at his own notoriety; and singular as it may seem, Augusta has found out, that he is a fine fellow. All the excuse that can be made for her is, that on the plains of Illinois nature works at the root, and the head and the heart develope early. There is another circumstance that must not be forgotten. There is a young stout Pottawattomie war chief with an Indian name of twenty syllables, that my tongue cannot exactly catch, (but the translation of the name is “Hurricane,”) who wears a looking-glass over his nose, has large ear jewels, and nice hedge-hog quill moccasins, and a hundred tinklers about his ancles, and each cheek rouged high with vermilion. This son of the forest has been lately seen much about their house, and has had, they discover, tete a tetes with Rescue. The dandy red skin subdued her heart at first sight. Poor Rescue knew not the pestilent nature of the mischief with which she was visited. Mrs. Clenning was prodigiously amused at hearing her describe the singular sensation inspired in her tender bosom at the sight of our gorgeous red skin. “Hurricane” has explained himself to Mr. Clenning in form, and it is to be a conditional match, that is to say, if he will leave the red skins, and come and fix in a cabin on the grounds of Mr. Clenning. The heart of Rescue is not doomed to despair, and this wedding will unite the islands of the South Sea, with the plains of the Illinois. END OF VOL. II.</field>
