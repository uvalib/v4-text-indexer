      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. —“BUT are you confident your work will meet with success?” inquired my friend. He was truly my friend; not in empty professions, but had proved himself so on trying occasions. He called in to pass a social hour; we had filled our glasses, lit our segars, and taken up our subject. He sat leaning his elbow upon the table, his cheek resting upon his hand. I thought his countenance expressed doubt and solicitude, when fixing his eyes upon mine, he asked, “Are you confident your work will meet with success?” “Not confident,” I replied. “I think, however, it will, or I would never incur the expense of publication.” “I hope it may; but should it not, your paper-maker, your printer, and your binder will engross the whole profits.” It was a discouraging remark—I was silent. “And then what do you not hazard in becoming an author!” he continued. “The loss or gain of time and money.” “Nothing beside? Writers generally aspire to fame, or, at least, hope for applause.” “True; but I have an advantage— there are no Critical Reviewers to bribe, in this country.” My friend smiled—“So much the worse,” said he, “all your readers will be reviewers.” “So much the better; they must read before they can review.” A 2 “But a few of your first readers may be incompetent judges, and unjustly condemn the work.” “Such characters are as likely to decide on the right side as the wrong; to extol as to decry. There again, you perceive I have a chance. But it is by people of sentiment and taste that I expect to be tried.” “Then, I trust you have judiciously constructed your plot, and have not lost sight of unity of design, in your plan.” “A fig for your plots and unities of design,” I peevishly answered; “mere formalities; fetters to pathos and sublimity; a sort of puzzling cards to perplex the reader, raising expectations which are never realized. Animated narrative, striking incident, glowing description, and an interesting denouement, are the true costume of novel.—Though, on reflection, I think you will find I have done pretty well in what you style plot, and unity of design.” “There are very few American productions of this kind entitled to merit.” “And that is one of my reasons for publishing. You will consider this as a mark of vanity. Perhaps it is so.” “But why,” resumed my friend after a long pause, “why have you chosen novel for your subject? or why, indeed, have you entered upon the profession of an author at all?” “As to your first question,” I replied, “why did Cervantes, Fielding, Richardson, Dr. Smollet, Le Sage, Voltaire, Rosseau, Goldsmith, Sterne, Dr. Johnson, Swift, St. Pierre, Marmontel, Fenelon, Dr. Moore, Walpole, Gesner, Gothie, Lewis, Miss Smith— Seward— West —Burney—Williams—Owenson—Porter--Mrs. Radcliffe, and hundreds of others, select novel for their subject? Why did Homer write poetry, Euclid the elements of mathematics, Franklin on electricity, Vattel on the law of nations? Why have other authors written the histories of Johny Gilpin, Tommy Thumb, Jack-a-Dandy, and Whittington's Cat? Is not a writer the best judge of his own abilities, and most capable of choosing his subject? “To your second inquiry, various answers might apply. Suppose I should say amusement was the stimulus; to relieve the mind from melancholy depression; the acquisition of property, of literary fame, or merely a penchant for writing, or all these, would you believe me? You know that by the fate of battle[1] [1] A political conflict. I have lost a station, which, if not lucrative, yet admitted free employment for the pen, and probably you conjecture I am unwilling to relinquish it. Or would you rather impute the cause to necessity? If so, I can appeal to high precedent, as the lawyer would say. I have, somewhere, read the following story: “The famous Goldsmith, after writing and publishing several valuable works, was reduced to actual penury. From comfortable and fashionable lodgings, he suddenly retired to a miserable hovel, in a by-lane, and took a sorry garret therein, the furniture of which consisted only of a flock-bed, two stools and a table. One window, whose broken panes were `eked with tatters gay,' afforded him light. As he, one day, sat `poring over the black volume of his fate,' the illustrious Dr. Johnson appeared abruptly before him. Alternate surprise ensued. Goldsmith had made none of his friends acquainted with his circumstances, but, in withdrawing himself, had, as he supposed, taken his measures so secretly as to prevent discovery. Johnson was then compiling his Dictionary, and, in pecuniary matters, was, in reality, no better off than Goldsmith, whom he had found by mere accident, after the strictest search and inquiry, the object of which was to borrow a few guineas to aid him in the execution of his work. Goldsmith informed Johnson that a single guinea was all the earthly property he possessed, and that, besides, he was deeply in debt. Mutual explanation and consultation succeeded. They called in a bottle of wine and a cold cut, over which they discussed future prospects and proceedings. Johnson advised Goldsmith to write a novel, to which, after some hesitation, he consented. The guinea was then changed to pay for the entertainment, and the remainder divided between them. Johnson departed; Goldsmith immediately commenced his labour, and in due time produced that excellent monument of his genius, The Vicar of Wakefield, the profits of which not only saved him from wretchedness and a prison, but enabled him to assist his friend Johnson in completing his stupendous fabric of scientific crudition, and rich treasure of instruction. “You will probably think I have not yet answered your queries—Of course I must refer you to my preface.” My friend sighed as he took his hat to depart. It was the sigh of affection. He felt for my situation. He feared lest disappointment should wither my hopes, and blast my expectations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. COMPRISING A SHORT DISSERTATION ON NOVEL. THE eighteenth century, says a writer, may be peculiarly and emphatically called the Age of Novels.[2] [2] Miller's Retrospect of the 18th Century; a very useful, instructing, and excellent work. See Chap. “Romances and Novels,” where the subject is copiously and ably treated. The remark is undoubtedly applicable, from the number which appeared within that period, and the avidity with which they were sought and read. Among these, some were from authors of distinguished abilities, and will long be celebrated; others are but miserable imitations, destined never to receive a second impression. Novel, or Romance,† † That kind of Novel which treats of wild adventures, or heroic achievements, is styled Romance. is a species of narrative in which either the principal characters are real, and the incidents compounded of fiction and truth, or where the actors, the scenery and the drama, are entirely imaginary. When embellished with national characteristics, that of the former class cannot fail of claiming preference, as the most interesting. The days of chivalry afforded ample scope and materials for Romance. To the knights errant the most absurd and improbable exploits and achievements were ascribed, such as the demolition of impregnable castles, the destruction of monsters and mighty giants. Even dæ mons were put to flight, enchantments broken, and the powers of darkness vanquished, by these all-conquering, roving, gentry. Extravagant as these fabulous stories were, and abounding, as they did, with licentiousness and impurity, yet, in those gloomy and superstitious times, they, for a long season, held an unbounded influence over public taste, which, in all ages, has fondly relished the wonderful and the marvellous. But the shafts of ridicule, from the quiver of genius, finally demolished the magic structure, destroyed the fantastic apparatus, and effected a reform in general sentiment; since which, fictitious narrative has experienced various improvements and modifications, B until it received the costume in which it now appears. But though Novel is divested of some of its objectional qualities, it yet retains many irregularities and disproportionate features. In general, its characters are incorrectly drawn, its incidents improbable, its descriptive colourings artificial and unnatural. To the discriminating eye, a distorted portrait is ever disgusting. Another fault is the multiplicity of character introduced, through a mistaken notion of producing variety, by which, not only the reader, but frequently the writer himself, is plunged into a wilderness of intricate mazes, from whence, with extreme difficulty and embarrassment, the chain of events leads to the final catastrophe, through inextricable confusion, and impenetrable obscurity. Diversity of incident may be happily effected, without involving the plot in a host of personage. But the most important objection to these productions, is their immoral tendency. Nor can the objection be esteemed unfounded, when we consider the manner in which they are commonly written. In most of our modern novels, seduction forms the prominent feature.— On the one hand, all the faculties, every active power, all the affections, are concentrated and drawn to a point—the indulgence of a single passion. Wealth, reputation, honour, health, are considered as trifling sacrifices to the attainment of the object pursued, which, no sooner is possessed than abandoned, without a sigh of regret, though its transition from innocence to infamy be the consequence. On the other side, youth, beauty, loveliness, virtue, with all the fascinating graces of female excellence, are set in battle array against the formidable foe. The conflict is minutely described, offensive by the former party, defensive by the latter, which, notwithstanding its inferiority in strength and tactic skill, makes a brave resistance against clandestine intrigue and open force, external and internal adversaries; and though driven to the last extremity, refuses to surrender, on offer of the most liberal and flattering terms; and when finally vanquished, it is by surprise, by escalade, by bribing the guards, or by lulling them asleep with some soporific preparation. In this representation the language glows with the `sorcery of sentiment,' the scenery with meretricious voluptuousness, serving as incentives to indelicate passion, as stimuli to licentious principle. To portraitures like these, few, if any originals, ever existed. There is another class of novelists, perhaps equally dangerous. These affect to follow nature, and to draw their characters from real life. Thus, as a contrast to the virtuous and worthy qualifications which their principal personages are made to possess, they must also exhibit their foibles, their frailties, and their vices; and as they never fail to make the former predominate, the reader, as he becomes interested in the story, loses his aversion to the evil actions and propensities, in the splendour and brilliancy of the meritorious exploits and achievements, and is finally induced to venerate the hero, though `black with murder, sacrilege and crime.' On this point, the writer is of opinion, that real pictures of life and manners, are the province of history; of novel, to portray characters as they probably might be. Previous to the age of chivalry, so far as we have any evidence, the general, character of Romance was less exceptionable than even under the boasted refinement of the present day. The most ancient which has fallen within the writer's knowledge, is the Ethiopics of Heliodorus, a bishop of Thessaly, written about the year A. D. 350. Who that has read it, but must have felt a deep and sympathetic interest in the delicate and sentimental disquietudes, the tender loves, and affectionate vicissitudes, of Theagines and Chariclea, the principal personages in the work? Who but must admire the beauty of scenery, the correctness of descriptive drapery, therein displayed? It was a chaste and virtuous production, yet such were the superstition and fanaticism of the day, that the bishop was not only deprived of his office, but excommunicated the church, for refusing to suppress it. It would be difficult to point out the novels which have obtained the greatest popularity, so various and so different are public taste and opinion. In the field of satire, perhaps, the Don Quixote of Cervantes leads the van, from which, probably, B 2 Butler took the hint for forming the drama of his famous Hudibras. The Tom Jones of Fielding has generally been considered as a finished production, yet it abounds with indelicacy, grossness and profanity, abhorrent to a correct mind. For incident, Brookes' Fool of Quality, is, by many, styled eminent; and as a compilation of truth and fiction, the Travels of Cyrus, is highly esteemed. As a philosophical performance, the Rasselas, of Dr. Johnson, is justly celebrated, as is Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield, for its chastity and moral tendency, though, by some, it has been objected to, on account of its uniformity, want of incident, and of variety. But of all the novels extant, none has been considered more dangerous to youthful morals and principles than Rosseau's Nouvelle Heloise, Like the poems of Anacreon Moore, its blandishing, florid, and seductive style, irresistibly interests the heart, and enlists the passions and the affections. Sentimentally voluptuous, and licentiously descriptive, its glowing pages fascinate the intellectual powers, and like the dæmon in an angel's form, charm, and allure, but to destroy. It is said that the author, when he wrote this singular work, did not intend it for publication, but that adverse circumstances, in his advanced years, induced him to commit it to the press. Dr. Miller justly observes that the novels most esteemed for their chastity and purity, are those written by ladies; among these may be named the Children of the Abbey, Camilla, and other productions from the same pens, as also the works of Miss Seward, Williams, C. Smith, Owenson, Mrs. Sheridan, Brooke, and some others. The historic Romances of Miss Porter, particularly her Thaddeus of Warsaw, and her Scottish Chiefs, are peculiarly celebrated; the former of which has already run through several editions. But no writer, ancient or modern, has yet equalled Mrs. Radcliffe, in the field of Romance. In pathos, incident, in interesting narrative, and particularly in sublime description, mingled with wild romantic scenery, and solemn terrific imagery, she has no rival; added to these, her style is elegant, natural and easy, and her pages unsullied by a stain. The unfortunate fate of this lady is deeply to be lamented by every friend to genius and sentimental literature.[3] [3] Mrs. Radcliffe was married to a gentleman whose name was Randolph, after which, from what circumstance is not known by the writer, she became deranged in intellect. In her ravings she is said to have imagined that the wild scenes of terror she so ably depicted, in her Romances, were real. Whether she has recovered a composed state of mind, the author of this work has not been informed. Few novelists of any eminence, have appeared in this country. Indeed the only one who can lay much claim to originality, is Brown, of Philadelphia. His writings evince rich invention, lively description, and classical diction. Some, however, have complained of their sameness in rapidity of style. Miss Warren, of Boston, has written a work of considerable merit, entitled The Gamesters; Glencairne, also, by the author of The Lawyer, is no mean production. In fictitious narrative the scenery should be natural, the sentiment pure, the story probable, and explicit; not loaded with inexplicated incidents, nor involved in mysteries unelucidated by the catastrophe. Indecorous stimulants ought, on no occasion, to be admitted, profanity never personified, nor should carricatura be freely indulged, unless the performance be farcical. In description, the portraits should be drawn from familiar objects, the paintings correct, the colours regular: they may glow, but not dazzle; strike, but not confound. The pictures, though taken from nature, yet ought not to represent either the brightest or the darkest traits in the originals. Gross and immoral imagery should ever be avoided. That romantic history may be so written as to be productive of real usefulness and advantage, cannot, with propriety be denied. When properly executed, it tends to purify and elevate the affections; to improve the mind, while it amuses the fancy; to amend, as well as to interest the heart, and thus enlarge the sphere of knowledge, and promote the cause of moral and social virtue. There are, indeed, some novels which may lay claim to this distinction; but these are, comparatively, so few, and those of a contrary tendency so numerous, that the general character of Novel has been brought into disrepute. To assist in retrieving the reputation of sentimental story, has been the author's aim in the ensuing work; a reputation tarnished, not by integral defect, or constitutional depravity, but by a deviation, like the true church, from its original, correct, and orthodox standard. The fine gold has become debased, and rendered impure by the copious mixture of alloy. As an exemplification to preceding observations, it may not be improper here to remark, that the most sublime specimens of fine writing, the most splendid productions of belleslettres genius, of either ancient or modern date, have been presented to us in the form of Novel. The Iliad of Homer, the ænead of Virgil, Ossian's Fingal, Milton's Paradise, Dwight's Conquest, Barlow's Columbiad, and several other similar performances, are, in fact, epic novels, possessing the polished and superior advantages of lofty and majestic numbers. They have their unities of design, their plots, and their catastrophes. They are systems of ingenious fiction, built on truth, embellished with incident, description, sentiment, and with all the grand apparatus of heroic romance. Of the comic, and tragi-comic class, instances might be adduced. Writers on other subjects, from the earliest times, have adopted this mode for conveying wise and useful information to man. But what wilt thou say, moral reader, should the author inform thee that thy Bible contains specimens of this species of writing? Yet be assured that such is the fact. The sacred writers, the holy seers, and the inspired prophets, frequently had recourse to this method, for the purpose of revealing, and instilling into the mind the most solemn and important truths. Even the great founder of the Christian religion, often inculcated its principles by similitude, or parable; a convincing proof of its utility in gaining access to the heart. It is not, therefore, the essential, or radical principle, but the perverted use, or abuse, of this kind of composition, which admits just cause of complaint; and to similar abuses and complaints are the best and wisest of human inventions and institutions ever liable. Then let not the moralist or the Divine, turn, fastidiously, from our pages, before he has given them a perusal. Let not prejudice condemn the book, merely because it may be considered as coming under the class of Novel. Permit it to speak for itself; let it be its own advocate; read it, and then decide according to its merits. From preceding remarks, the general plan on which the following work is attempted, may be perceived. One point, the author has endeavoured to establish, that a firm reliance on Providence, however the affections and the passions may be at war with its dispensations, is the only real source of consolation in the gloomy hours of affliction; and that, generally, such dependence, though embarrassed with difficulties and perplexities, will, in the end, meet a happy and victorious reward. If any should object to it as a work of fancy, the author informs them that this is not, exclusively, the case, in respect to the succeeding production, as the principal characters there introduced, are still living, though their names, for obvious reasons, are assumed. To some of the detailed events, witnesses yet remain to attest. It may be esteemed a juvenile production, as the historic part was moulded into form by the writer in the leisure hours of his early years, and a few of the incidents interwoven therewith; methodized, and delineated, with additional colourings, it thereafter appeared in a miscellaneous print; it is now published on a revised, and much extended scale, in which former deficiencies are supplied, preceding errors corrected, and new characters, scenes, and occurrences, introduced. Romance, founded on great events, and embracing eminent characters and important achievements, cannot be written, with any considerable degree of interest and effect, where the scenery is laid, and the drama cast, in America; because, should it be attempted, the theatre must be erected on the field of the revolution, an era not sufficiently remote, and comprising occurrences too recent, to be arrayed in the vesture of fiction. It will, however, furnish materials, and the most brilliant apparatus, to a writer of some succeeding century. Should there be found those who may consider the work too highly decorated C with descriptive drapery, or object to what is termed a luxuriancy of style, the writer would observe that it was his original intention to give it as great a variety of vivid colourings as he conceived it would bear; and, unless he is mistaken, if the paintings are correct, it renders the performance much more acceptable to readers of sentimental taste and refinement. Embellished with these fanciful decorations, Novel is a garden of rich shrubbery and flowers; without them, it is a cheerless and dreary waste. The author well knows what critics can say on this subject. They may censure him as loading his style with the epithets of poetry, which they may pronounce inelegant and improper, in such kind of composition, and call on Aristotle, Longinus, and a thousand other critical annotators, to prove the correctness of this opinion. In plain narrative, the remark would, doubtless, be correct; but Novel is of a different character; it is compounded of historic description, of real and fictitious incident; it is, therefore, nearly allied, not only to poetry, but, also, to painting, where, in similar cases, fancy is permitted to display her colourings with superior brilliancy, and with greater freedom, than on more classic or methodical subjects. Hence, few readers would become interested in a novel, written after the formal and philosophic manner of analogous history. In the narrative department, it was intended the language should be of the middle class, neither soaring to that sublimity which dazzles the understanding by its perpetual glitter, nor sinking to dull and trite inelegance. If such be the fact, it will have constituted a variety of diction, and formed a contrast to those descriptive parts where a more florid style is admitted. Contrary to general custom, the principal episode, instead of being intermingled in alternate periods through the body of the work, is given entire. This mode was preferred, not solely as a precedent, but because it was esteemed as better adapted to the taste of most readers, who prefer connexion and regularity to disorder and interruption; and although this episode may not be considered as forming an important link in the grand chain of events—of unity, plot, and design—yet was it not introduced, merely, to swell the volumes, but with a view to picture man in the various grades and attitudes of life, through affluence, mediocrity, misfortune, and wretchedness. Its perusal was also intended to prepare the mind of Melissa, young and inexperienced in the ways of life, for the events she, thereafter, was destined to encounter. The sketch therein comprised relative to new settlers, may, likewise, not be found uninteresting. At any rate, it constitutes variety, which is not the least object in performances of this description. Errors not discerned by an author, may yet be discovered by the critical reader. It would be rare, if, especially in a first edition, such was not the case. On this point the writer will only remark, that it was not in his power, from his local situation, to submit the manuscript to a circle of literary friends for their inspection, advice, or correction. He was, therefore, compelled to rely upon his own judgment. The production is entirely American. The poetry is all from the geniuses of our own country, to most of whom credit is given; where this is not done, it is because the writer was not at liberty to make the references. The scenery, though extended to Europe, is laid in New-London, Boston, Charleston, (S. C.) and in various other parts of the United States. Whether the author has succeeded in his attempt; whether his work will obtain general approbation, or be thrown aside among other ephemeral productions of the day, must yet be decided by the public tribunal. That his hopes are in his favour, he need scarcely say. Should he experience disappointment, he would have the satisfaction still left, that, to him, the circumstance would not be unprecedented, and that he, only, must be the principal sufferer. It will not, he also flatters himself, be deemed censurable, that he has contributed a particle to the common stock, with a view to increase the happiness, by adding to the amusement, of the people of his own country. THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">C 2 CHAPTER I. When young in life, nor known to sorrow, How lightly flew the gladsome day! Gay dreams of bliss brought on the morrow, And gilt the sun's declining ray. Hope pictured years of tranquil pleasure, Peace and content she held to view; My trusting heart dwelt o'er its treasure, And thought the lovely vision true. Mrs. Rose. Sometime previous to the commencement of the American revolution, there resided, in the western part of Connecticut, a gentleman of English extraction, whose ancestors were among the earliest settlers of this country. The patrimony he inherited from his father, he had, by various speculation, increased until he became the richest man in those parts. His property lay in numerous cultivated farms, most of which were advantageously rented; in valuable wild lands, and in money at interest on indubitable security. His name was Bloomfield. He was the descendant of an ancient and once noble family, on which he prided himself with all that distinguished haughtiness so characteristic of national prejudice and manners, but without possessing a disposition to shine in the circles of the gay, or to lavish any portion of his fortune in grandeur and equipage, or what the world style the pleasures of high life. While he looked upon the poorer class as an inferior kind of beings in society, he esteemed the rich as an order of nobility. “By prudence and perseverance,” he would say, “any man in this country may become independent. It is the idle and the dissipated, only, who are poor.” For calamities and accidents, he made no allowance, as these, he believed, his foresight and sagacity had enabled him to evade; and he considered, also, that his own wealth had been principally acquired by diligent application to business. He knew little of literature beyond the name, having received nothing more than a common-school education; but to balance this, he was deeply skilled in the worth of a dollar, and well understood now to apply it to its best use. In casting accounts, or in calculating compound interest, he was an adept, even to farthings. For money loaned, he took mortgages on lands and tenements, in security, and as there frequently occurred failures in the payment, he often had opportunities of purchasing the involved premises at his own price. He was likewise perfectly acquainted with the art of bargaining. If a farmer, either from embarrassment, or with a view to amend his situation, held his possessions for sale, the ready money of Col. Bloomfield would effect more than the most responsible paper of others, though at prompt instalments. This, he called, “striking while the iron was hot.” Merchants and tradesmen, besides interest, were willing to give him premiums for the loan of cash, which was extremely scarce in those days, as there were, then, no banks in this country, by which they could be accommodated. The labourer and mechanic, sure of present pay, would work for him at reduced wages. Being under no necessity to sell, he strictly watched and always obtained the highest market-price for the produce of his farms. Thus, while he daily experienced a rapid accumulation of wealth, he exhibited, only, the appearance of a plain Connecticut farmer. He had been advanced to various grades of office; was justice of the peace; had frequently been a member of the legislature; was colonel of a regiment of militia, which office he had held for several years, and for as long a time had been deacon of the church. Strictly honest in his dealings, and never having sacrificed upon the altar of the refined passions, he held every infraction of justice and integrity as criminal, and knew not how to pardon even errors and failings. Hence, shrouded in a repulsive, but self-created dignity, he commanded, among his acquaintance, a sort of invidious respect. The poor of his neighbourhood knew no more why they feared, than why they could not love him; still none hated him. The number of his enemies were few; of his friends, still less. He had lived till he was a bachelor before he married; he then chose his wife as he would have done a farm, not so much for beauty as convenience. She was the daughter of a respectable clergyman. Her disposition was amiable, her manners and habits mild, retiring, and domestic. She superintended the affairs of her household with the strictest care and prudence. Unlike some flaunting dames of the present day, she did not esteem it dishonourable to lay her hands to the spindle and the distaff. Indeed, we could not give a more correct description of her character, than by referring to that of Solomon's heroine, as delineated in the last chapter of his Proverbs. They had but two children; the eldest a son, whom they called Edgar; the other a daughter, named Melissa. Though destitute himself, yet having learnt the value of education, he determined to provide the means of obtaining it for his children; and being a rigid presbyterian, he concluded that his son could no where figure so well, or gain so much eminence, as in the sacred desk. Edgar, therefore, was kept at school till he arrived at a suitable age, when he was entered at Yale College. Melissa was sent to New-London, under the charge of a maiden aunt, to reside with a relative of the family who had settled there, until she should have completed the education designed for her, at a celebrated female academy in that place. This relative, whose name was Glenford, was cousin to her by the mother's side. Having but recently married, he had no children. Martha Bloomfield, Melissa's aunt, who attended her, was about forty years old. She had been a reigning toast, in her youth, but a coquette and a prude. Hence, her numerous admirers relinquished their pretensions as her beauty and the graces deserted her. She had received the most flattering offers, some of which she refused, and suspended others. She was, in many respects, the counterpart of Col. Bloomfield, her brother. Her family and fortune, she thought, connected with her personal accomplishments, would, at any time, ensure her a choice among the humble devotees who sighed at her feet, if she should condescend to make the selection. Like many calculators of superior wisdom and understanding, she did not discover her error until too late to retrieve it. Still, she was not without consolation; her father had provided amply for her in his will. She possessed lands, the rents of which were more than adequate to her maintenance. Though she frequently visited among her numerous relatives, yet she principally resided with Melissa's father, who, by humouring her peculiarities, consulting her on trivial occasions, and sometimes adopting her advice, when it did not run counter to his own opinion, induced her to suppose that she held no small influence over him. He had an object in view by this; her fortune he hoped to secure in his own family, provided she should never marry, which, probably, would be the case. She was called Aunt Martha by the family, and Miss Martha by her other acquaintance. In due time, Melissa's education being finished, and Edgar having graduated, they returned to their paternal residence, which bore the name of Bloomfield Vale. Col. Bloomfield, though an austere man, was extremely attached to his children. They were the solace of his life, the hope and comfort of his declining years. But his tenderness did not injure them by too much indulgence. He early taught them that his advice was to be taken as law; that his injunctions were not to be disputed, and that the line of conduct marked out by him was to be undeviatingly pursued. Hence it followed that his will need only be known, to be strictly obeyed. From the splendid fortune to be divided between them, he foresaw that they must obtain eminence and distinction in society, provided they connected honourably, and sustained unblemished characters; and though his expectations had been, thus far, realized; though present prospects gave earnest of future felicity, yet he most anxiously hoped to see them happily settled in life while under his immediate care, and before he should descend to the tomb. Edgar appeared calculated for the station to which he was designated. Cheerful, but decently reserved; liberal in sentiment, his soul was the seat of honour, integrity, and virtue. Though selected for a particular church, to which he, also, gave the preference, he was no bigot in religion. He knew that there were different sects of Christians, and he believed that the portals of Heaven were D open to more than one denomination. Consecrated to reform, he would be prepared to love mankind; to cast the mantle of charity over their failings, correct their errors by mildness, and to extend the cherishing hand of forgiveness to the repentant. While his mind had been informed, his heart was expanded by the enlightening rays of science. Melissa, now seventeen years of age, whose taste had been properly directed by a suitable education, possessed a mind adorned with those delicate graces which are the first ornaments of female excellence. Neither prudery nor coquetry mingled in her character. Her soul was too serene to be the sport of freak or caprice. She would not start at a shadow, or shriek at the sudden rustling of a leaf. She knew not to blush at a compliment, or faint in crowded assemblies. Her fortitude could not be alarmed by the wild phantoms of imagination, or the startling suggestions of superstition. She was not esteemed a striking beauty, but her appearance was pleasingly interesting. Her figure elegant; hair of a light brown; in her cheek, the tinges of the lily and the rose, gently striving for supremacy, mingled the inimitable die of health. Her aspect was attempered with a pensive mildness, which, in her gayer moments, would light up into sprightliness and vivacity. Though, on first impressions, her countenance was marked by a sweet and thoughtful serenity, yet she eminently possessed the power to “Call round her laughing eyes, in playful turns, “The glance that lightens and the smile that burns” eyes beaming expressive tenderness, and in the texture of which were happily blended “The gentlest azure of the skies, “The mildest shadows of the grove.” The seat of Col. Bloomfield stood at a little distance from the main road. It was surrounded with cultivated fields, woodlands, meadows, and pastures, interspersed with valleys and hills, among which, small rivulets variously meandered. At some distance from the house, was a very broad and elevated eminence, styled the Mountain; it commanded an extensive prospect of country; of forests farm-houses, towns and villages; also, of Long-Island, the Sound between that and the mainland, and the opening thereof to the distant ocean. Amidst these rural and solitary scenes, Melissa loved to wander. The devious recesses of the woods, the blossomed banks of plaintive streams, the fragrance of verdant fields, and the wild melody of various birds, in the green season of the year, yielded her sincerer pleasure, than the most brilliant splendours of ball-rooms and assemblies. Here, with Edgar, could she realize and retrace the innocent and happy incidents of their earliest childhood. Here had they chased the gay butterfly from flower to flower, till it soared away, leaving them perplexed to discover why the gaudy flutterer should so assiduously shun the approach of those who intended it no manner of harm; there they waded the narrow brook to select the shining, transparent pebbles, from its shallow bed; here they basked on the sunny hill side, or reclined beneath intermingling branches, watching the labours of the industrious bee, while collecting its sweets from the blooms around; admiring the diligent ant, as it brought up the grains of sand from its subterraneous cells, or bore its winter provender to the fairy caverns it had thus prepared; or remarking, with still more fixed attention, the labours of the parent bird, as, with mechanic powers, peculiarly its own, it constructed its curious nest, or provided for its unfledged young, with examplary care, and paternal solicitude. In yonder field had they stained their hands with the rich strawberry, or with hurtleberries in the adjoining shrubbery; or wounded their little fingers in plucking the fruit of the prickly bramble. Here had they striven, in friendly emulation, to cull the gayest flowers from the varied myriads which spangled the plain. On yonder hill they had counted the numerous vessels as they sailed up and down the Sound. They recollected how they had often sat on some high rock, viewing the sweaty reapers gathering the ripe harvest in the surrounding fields, or the dusty plowman turning the broad furrow behind his lagging team, while the music of numerous different birds, the song of the grasshopper, the low hum of bees, and the variant notes of a thousand diverse insects, floated on the loitering breeze. Frequently had they lingered until the whipperwill's cheerful lay, from an adjacent thicket, warned them of approaching twilight. Sometimes, D 2 alarmed by the blackening shower, rising suddenly over the woody summits, they had hastened homeward with trembling speed, while the vivid lightning crinkled across their path, and the volleying thunder pursued close behind them. With pleasure could they now recal those happy days of infancy and innocence, because their young minds were yet unimbittered by sorrow, and undisturbed by the serious carcs of life. After a lapse of years, and a separation from their beloved parents and home, they traversed, with transport, the same fields and woodlands, where, in childhood, they had experienced so many joyful hours. Birds of the same note and plumage flitted from bough to bough, or warbled their untaught melody along the landscape. There stood the tall hickory, under which they had so often gathered their winter stores of walnuts; here the branching chesnut, whose thorny balls they were wont, cautiously, to assail, to obtain the delicacy within; yonder the butternut, and the humble hazle, they had been accustomed to rifle of their nutricious treasures. The little hillock, in the midst of the lawn, where, by moonlight, they had, so frequently, sported with their juvenile companions, had suffered no change. The orchards and the gardens, the fields and the flowers, the brooks, the groves, the shrubbery, and the fruit-trees, were the same, and revived in their bosoms sensations solemnly pleasing, as they strolled leisurely among them. The amusements of that day, though not so diversified, were, yet, more rational than many of the present, particularly in country towns. Those in which Edgar and Melissa joined when connected with mixed company, consisted, in the summer, of excursions on horseback, or in carriages, to some place in the country, famous for hurtleberries or strawberries; often to the margin of the Sound; thence would they stray along the white sandy beaches, which, at low water, extended far from the shore; or divert themselves for an hour by venturing out in a sail-boat; and, generally, once in the season, they crossed, with a large party, to Long-Island, where they would pass a week among acquaintance. In the winter, sleigh-rides to neighbouring towns and villages were customary, and though not frequently, yet occasionally, they attended dancing assemblies. These, with friendly visits, and social tea-parties, constituted the principal portion of their public diversions. At New-London, Melissa become acquainted with a young gentleman of that town, who possessed an independent fortune which had devolved upon him by the death of his father. He was of a gay and volatile character; his manners rather voluptuous than delicately refined; his address was easy; though confident, yet not ungraceful. He led the ton in fashionable circles, and gave taste its zest, and was quite a favourite with the New-London belles. His name was Bowman. Among the gallants who had paid respectful attention to Melissa, Bowman had been the most particular. He was her partner at balls, and her attendant in mixed companies. When, with her aunt, she returned to her family, he escorted them; and having some distant connexions residing in a village not far from Bloomfield Vale, he frequently visited them, and, of course, Melissa, which, indeed, appeared to be his principal object. When there, he attended her in parties of pleasure and recreation, and to her selected circles he always resorted. Hence, as appearances seemed to warrant, a rumour obtained circulation that Miss Bloomfield was shortly to exchange her name for that of Mrs. Bowman. By inquiry, her father soon learned that the family of the young gentleman claimed the first respectability, and that his fortune was equal to his wishes. He did not, therefore, forbid his visits; for though he was not exactly the man he would have selected for his son-in-law, yet being addicted to no public vice, and not destitute of abilities, he trusted that when the wild vagaries of youthful levity should evaporate, objects of a different nature would be pursued, such as might ensure eminence, and what is esteemed felicity. On further acquaintance with Bowman, he discovered that he possessed a yielding temper; not suddenly or causelessly irritable, but rather forbearing. He thought, also, that, through the exuberance of frivolity, he could perceive the prolific germs of real honour, and, on the whole, considered him as a character with whom his daughter might be happy. Melissa, he had not consulted. On her discretion and discernment, he felt himself safe to rely. Her choice, he had ever trusted and believed, would comport with his own. From Bowman, he shortly expected a declaration, and if it accorded with his daughter's wishes, he concluded to sanction it. One day Bowman called on Melissa, and invited her to take an airing in his curricle. Delighted with the scenery rural prospects afford, she consented. They rode out through different parts of the country, now ascending high hills, now rolling into valleys; sometimes the road leading between thick woods, then over plains, interspersed with meadows and orchards, which now blooming in all the glory of spring, cast their exhilirating fragrance to the passing gales. Farm-houses and cottages appeared in various directions; and bounded by lofty groves, extended fields, chequered by fenced cultivation, swelled into gentle acclivities, or sank into verdurous vales, over which were sprinkled flocks of sheep, and cattle of various colour, grazing the rich pastures, ruminating under shady trees, or drinking at the crystaline brooks which meandered in devious windings, with whispering murmur. As they were returning, they entered a copse, where grew the wild honeysuckle, mingling its premature fruit with its early flowers. Bowman stepped out to gather some of the former, Melissa remaining in the carriage. While thus engaged, the report of a gun, fired by a sportsman, was heard just by them. Alarmed at the noise, the horses sprang forward, and ran, furiously, along the road till they came to an opening, when they took to the fields. Melissa endeavoured to stop them, but her strength was insufficient. They hurried her towards a dangerous declivity. At that moment, a gentleman who was journeying on the road, perceiving her perilous situation, spurred his horse at full speed, came up with the curricle, and, at the risk of his life, stopped the career of the horses, just as they were on the point of plunging down a steep, rocky precipice, which must have dashed the carriage to atoms, and precipitated Melissa into eternity. The sudden check flung her to the ground; the gentleman alighted, and raised her. She had not fainted, but with the fright, and the shock received by the fall, her senses were, for a moment, bewildered. She immediately revived, so as to thank her preserver in terms of the most ardent gratitude. He was satisfied, he said, provided she was safe, but he was apprehensive she had received serious injury. She assured him the effect was but slight. Bowman soon came up, and joined in presenting acknowledgements to the stranger. The parties were shortly prepared for separation, Bowman and Miss Bloomfield to pursue their route homeward, and the stranger his journey. For so short an acquaintance, the parting seemed affectionate; considering the circumstances, no wonder it should be so. After renewed salutation the gentleman mounted his horse, and the carriage moved on. When at some distance, Melissa, perhaps involuntarily, looked back; the stranger remained still fixed to the spot where they had left him, gazing stedfastly after them. Perceiving that she observed him, he instantly turned his horse, and gallopped swiftly away. From the incidents which had thus occurred, Miss Bloomfield became so indisposed, that, by the time they reached home, she was scarcely able to retain her seat. The family, alarmed at her situation, gathered around her, anxiously inquiring the cause of her illness, of which Bowman gave them an account. A physician was immediately called, who, after prescribing, intimated that rest and quietness would tend to restore her. She took a composing preparation, and retired to bed, her parents and Edgar watching, alternately, by her pillow. After a short slumber, she appeared very restless, and before morning was attacked with a high fever. The physician was again sent for, who advised bleeding, which being performed, and a gentle anodyne administered, she soon sank into calm sleep, and when she awoke, found herself much better, and entirely free from fever; but for several days she was not able to leave her room, during which, Bowman daily visited her and endeavoured to cheer her spirits, sometimes by reading to her from authors he knew she admired; at others, in sketching subjects for her pencil, in the use of which she was not an ordinary proficient; or in selecting airs for her harpsichord, which she touched with excellent skill and admirable pathos. E In reflecting upon the late circumstances of her preservation, Melissa considered the event as almost miraculous. When in the carriage, whirled along by impetuous horses, rendered frantic by affright, she saw herself on the verge of a tremendous precipice, ready to be plunged, and dashed to pieces, among the rocks below, she recommended her soul to its Creator, and gave herself up as lost. Thus suddenly, and casually, to be snatched from, to the human eye, inevitable death, impressed her mind with sensations not to be obliterated. The agitation of her senses, more than bodily injury, had produced illness. From the fall she experienced no other inconvenience than a severe shock, the effects of which were not serious. But who was the person by whose unexpected interposition she had been thus wonderfully preserved? Yet why should she ask this question? Who would not have done the same in like circumstances? A stranger, journeying on the road, perceives a fellow-creature in imminent danger, and extends the hand of relief. This was all that had been done; still, she could not help viewing him as her guardian angel, and feeling a strong curiosity to know who he was. To her, he appeared about twenty years of age, and she imagined she had never seen a person whose manners and address, on a single introduction, were so prepossessing. Thus it is with the generous heart; a disinterested favour conferred thereon, especially if the act tends to extricate from perilous situations, calls forth all its gratitude, all its acknowledgements. From circumstances attending the event, Melissa beheld the stranger in a different point of light, probably, than she would have done in any other way he could have been introduced. She was soon able to walk abroad, and indulge in her favourite rambles over her father's grounds, or to assist her mother in domestic employments, to which she daily devoted some hours, when at home, and unengaged by company. Edgar aided his father in managing the concerns of his landed estates, in collecting his rents, and settling with his tenants. Bowman had returned to New-London. As has been mentioned, Melissa's aunt, who now resided with Col. Bloomfield, possessed the reversion of several farms, the tenants of which it was her custom, at stated periods, to visit, for the purpose of receiving her rents, and to see how they managed matters. If any of them failed in punctual payment, or if they did not conduct affairs to her satisfaction, she made no scruple in turning them off at quarter-day, and supplying their places with others, more agreeable to her mind. This, she said, was keeping a “sharp look out,” though in consequence of such sharpness, her lands were, generally, in a bad state of cultivation; for the renters not knowing whether they should hold possession over one year, the term for which her leases were given, improved only the best part, leaving the remainder to its fate. Some of those farms lay a considerable distance in the country. On one of those visiting tours she invited her niece to accompany her, who readily assented. They travelled in a chaise, attended by a servant. The road was rough and uneven, which, with the intense heat of a summer sun, caused Melissa, before night, to complain of a violent headache. She, however, proceeded on till late in the evening, as her aunt wished to reach the residence of a Mr. Bergher, one of her principal agents, who had formerly rented some of her possessions, and still lived near them. He kept an excellent house, she said, was, as well as his wife, a foreigner, but a very honest man, and had, from extreme poverty, arisen to affluence, within a few years. His wife, she farther observed, appeared to possess the characteristics and qualifications of high life; it had been rumoured that some very singular circumstances attended their history, but of what nature they were, she could never discover. It was late when they reached the house of Bergher. Melissa was too ill to take any kind of refreshment, and soon retired to rest. By morning the pain in her head abated, but left her extremely languid and faint; her aunt, therefore, advised her to tarry there until she should return, which, she assured her, would be “in a few days at farthest;” the family joined in the advice, and Melissa, considering herself too feeble to continue the journey, consented. Miss Martha, after seeing her accommodated with every convenience, and charging Mrs. Bergher to “mind and take good care of her,” departed. E 2 The Bergher family, exclusive of servants, consisted of the parents, and five children; the eldest was a son, about twenty-two years old; the second, a daughter, aged about nineteen; the others, a son and two daughters, were yet in childhood and infancy. Bergher appeared about forty-five years of age, his wife a little younger; she was a woman of amiable manners, and of deportment which evinced her having been acquainted with the courtly circles of life; though faded, she still retained the traits of former beauty. The countenance of Bergher was open and frank, but spoke firmness, fortitude and decision. The children were amiable and lovely, but knew little of the world, having never mixed much in company. A separate chamber was assigned to Miss Bloomfield, who, from the family, received the politest attention. She had brought a few books in her trunk, with which she could amuse herself in the absence of her aunt, the day after whose departure, she experienced returning health, and walked out to view the surrounding scenery. An extended tract of cultivated land was spread around the habitation of Bergher, variegated with young harvests, meadows, corn and clover fields, orchards and wood-lots. The house was not elegant, but ample and convenient, as were, also, the barns, cribs, and granaries. On an adjacent stream stood those useful, and in a new country, indispensible engines, a grist, and saw-mill. An old log-hut, the emblem of former wretchedness, nearly adjoined one of the out houses; it was constructed of the rudest materials, and pointed with clay; the chimney was composed of rough stone and mortar, taken from the fields around; it contained but one room, of about twenty feet square; slabs were its roof, and for windows, small holes were cut through the logs. It was now falling into ruins, and served only for a hog-pen; there the farmer fattened his swine, where formerly he fed his children. With Katherine, and sometimes attended also by Roderick, the two eldest children, Melissa frequently wandered about the plantation. From a high eminence the eye surveyed a wide and varying landscape, glowing in voluptuous vegetation; and a glimpse of the distant Sound, appearing like a blue streak of painted glass, bordered on each side with fringes of native green, over which slept the light clouds of summer, as if rejoicing to repose on the bosom of their parent element. Returning, one afternoon, from a solitary ramble, she saw a man in a sulkey, driving towards the house, with a servant on horse-back behind him. His dress attracted Melissa's attention; he wore a scarlet coat, deeply trimmed with gold lace, a yellow vest, richly embroidered, with a large star, wrought in silver, on the breast; in his hat was a costly plume of feathers, decorated with a valuable diamond. She entered the house, and the stranger soon after. To appearance, he was about fifty years old, of stately mien and commanding aspect. Politely bowing to all present, he spoke in a language Melissa did not understand; Mrs. Bergher started, and gazing at him with apparent amazement, uttered an exclamation of surprise, and fainted. The gentleman raised her, Katherine flew to her, sprinkled water in her face, and she revived. “Oh my brother!” she exclaimed, “Is it possible you yet live?” She said something more, to which the stranger, who seemed much affected, replied; but they conversed in a foreign language. The youngest boy was ordered to call his father from the field, and Melissa, who had caught the sympathetic infection, thinking her presence might be obtrusive, retired to her chamber. At supper, the stranger was introduced to her by the title and appellation of the Baron Du Ruyter, a brother of Mrs. Bergher. His address was easy, disgnified and respectful; he spoke the English language imperfectly. Surprise, and inquisitive anxiety, were excited in the mind of Melissa. What her aunt had said respecting the Bergher family recurred to her memory. That they were connected with nobility was now evident; but of what nation, why they had abandoned their country in indigence, and so long been excluded from the world, were circumstances she would willingly have heard explained, but improper, as she believed, for her to inquire into. The next morning Mrs. Bergher entered Melissa's chamber, and after being seated, thus addressed her: “You, probably, Miss Bloomfield, were surprised at my emotions, yesterday, on the arrival of my brother; but your wonder would cease if you knew my reasons; they include something more than a meeting between such tender friends, after so long an absence.” “They evinced feelings which I shall ever venerate,” said Melissa, “and I seek no farther explanation.” “I never had any other brother,” continued Mrs. Bergher, “and in the most trying time of my life, he was, almost my only friend. We were parted many, very many years ago, by tragical events, since which time I have supposed, nay, confidently believed him in the silent grave. Judge then of my feelings on seeing him suddenly stand before me, on hearing his voice pronounce the name of sister, on thus receiving him as from the dead! From what you have seen and heard, you, no doubt, conjecture that singular incidents have attended our lives; you are right; singular, and extraordinary indeed are the records of our fortune. You are young, Miss Bloomfield, and as yet, can have seen but little of the world, and of course, know nothing of sorrow; I hope you never may. If my history could be of any service to you—but I think it never can; it is impossible you should ever be placed in circumstances subject to the dangers I have experienced, or the difficulties I have encountered. “I could not wish to intrude upon your family secrets,” replied Melissa, “or request a narrative of your life, if the recital would give you the least pain.” “By the arrival of my brother,” returned Mrs. Bergher, “we are relieved from anxieties and embarrassments which, for several years, have rendered, as it respects our affairs, secrecy, silence, and seclusion, indispensible; this being the case, we can experience no reluctance in disclosing, to the world, if necessary, the whole transactions of our past lives. I have written, at different periods, an abstract of the principal scenes in which I have been an actress, with the attending occurrences, from my earliest childhood. Some part thereof was originally written in the German language; but since our settlement in this country it has been revised and translated into English by Bergher. This abstract, however, is incomplete, owing to the mystery in which certain events were involved when we left our native country; my brother has elucidated them, which enables me to supply the deficiencies in my narrative, and which I shall immediately do, as I design to preserve it as a memorial for my children. “You, Miss Bloomfield, are the first person to whom I have revealed so much; and I am pleased that it is so. I shall ever consider myself under obligations to your family; they assisted us when we were strangers and destitute, poor and friendless; they aided and relieved us in our distress, without even the prospect of reward. I wish them, now, to become acquainted with our history; I can cheerfully entrust you with a perusal of my journal, and will”—At this moment Katherine entered the chamber to inform them breakfast was waiting, and her mother discontinued her discourse. It was four days after this before Miss Martha returned, during which time, with that anxiety attendant on curiosity, Melissa had expected that Mrs. Bergher would have renewed the subject she left unfinished, when interrupted by Katherine; but in this expectation she was disappointed. It was early in the morning when her aunt arrived, having slept at the house of one of her tenants a few miles off, probably to save expense. She requested her niece to “get ready as fast as possible, as she meant to reach home that night.” While Melissa was preparing, Mrs. Bergher came to her chamber, and putting into her hands a packet, “Here,” said she, “are the outlines of my history, make such use thereof as you please, only return me the manuscript, which I wish to retain for the purposes I have mentioned. It may tend to amuse you, nor is it impossible but it may serve as a beacon to guide your footsteps in some wildering maze of your future life.” They were soon ready to depart. Melissa took a tender leave of the family, to whom she had become greatly attached. Bergher and the Baron had, the day previous, gone to a neighbouring town, on some business, and had not returned. She did not, therefore, inform her aunt of Du Ruyter's arrival, determined F first to peruse the manuscript, when she would be better prepared to make the disclosure. They reached home by sunset; the next day she opened the packet, and at intervals read as in the succeeding pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Then, round melodious fields, I play'd; My heart could mount no lighter; Or, midst rich, odourous lilies, stray'd— As white as they—and whiter. Osborn. HISTORY OF THE BERGHER FAMILY. My father was the Baron Du Ruyter, a German nobleman of the first distinction, and high in favour with the Emperor. Of four children, a son and three daughters, I was the youngest. Both my sisters married noblemen at an early age. Before I was fifteen years old I had the misfortune to lose a very tender and affectionate mother, whose death I ever had the greatest reason to deplore. In the gay and populous city of Vienna, where my father resided, it was impossible but that I must have been early introduced into fashionable society; even during the life of my mother, I became acquainted with the various amusements of parties, balls, theatres, and drawing-rooms, and having been introduced at court, numerous were the gilded triflers who fluttered around me, with real or affected professions of respect and admiration. Shrounded in sables by the melancholy event I have mentioned, we were, for a season, relieved from the incessant bustle of company; but no sooner were the days of formal mourning ended, than we were, again, hurried the giddy rounds of fashion. Plays, operas, assemblies, levees, masquerades; visiting and receiving visits, followed each other in constant succession; these, however pleasing at first, became tiresome by continual repetition—I may say, disgusting, at least, they were so to me; sick of their tedious uniformity, I have frequently stolen away from the most brilliant circles, when pleasure and joy danced lightest among them, to indulge in a solitary ramble on some favourite spot, where my deceased mother once delighted to wander. The flower-bed, the arbour, the alcove, the cascade, were rendered doubly dear to me, for having been valued by her. Languidly pensive, would I return to the haunts of gaiety, the rattling of coaches, and the tumultuous scenes of convivial grandeur. Of those who professed themselves my most ardent admirers, the Count Hubert stood foremost. His age was several years in advance of mine. He was very rich, and nearly related to the reigning prince, by whom he was held in high estimation. I cannot say but that I was flattered by this nobleman's attention. As to wealth, and family eminence, he had few superiors; not only these, but his manners and demeanour, commanded respect, as he was more the original than the copyist of what is esteemed elegance and refinement in the most elevated circles. His address, I considered, neither winning nor repulsive, but his particularity to me was sufficient to excite envy in the bosoms of other ladies, who evinced it by arts of rivalship. My vanity, perhaps, took alarm, but I retaliated in no other way than by enjoying their chagrin and vexation. Soon after I entered my eighteenth year, my father married a second wife, the daughter of a reduced nobleman. She brought him no property, but she possessed a disposition to expend his fortune, though it was considered splendid. She entered into almost every kind of courtly extravagance, and was, F 2 besides, passionately fond of deep play. She was young and beautiful; my father, who tenderly loved her, thought not of restraining her propensities; consequently, in about two years after his marriage, he found his pecuniary affairs in rapid decline. Considering her my stepmother, I endeavoured to yield her the respect that station demanded, and to render myself agreeable to her; but she generally received my advances and attentions with reserve and coolness. She wished to shine, unobstructed by shade. I was considered as crossing her purposes. I had the advantage of her in the acquirements and improvements of education; flattery had, perhaps, taught me to suppose I possessed personal accomplishments, and that even beauty was among them. At any rate, she wished me disposed of by marriage, and would frequently teaze the Baron on the subject. These, however, were my days of bliss. I was young, inspired with animation, honoured and esteemed. Free from undue restraint, I knew nothing of care, and had but on one occasion in my life been acquainted with sorrow. The anguish inflicted by the death of my mother subsided with time, and left my affections in harmony with a calm, pensive serenity, which impressed pleasing sensations on the heart. I could now reflect on her tender cares, her parental solicitudes and anxieties, and her last advice, without experiencing those keen pangs of distress the bereavement at first excited. I was particularly delighted when, retiring from town, we passed a few weeks, in the summer season, at the Baron's villa in the country. There could I wander over the fields, gay with flowers and rich in verdure; trace the course of some winding brook, as it slid smoothly through willowy meadows, then rushed a torrent down precipitate declivities; or ramble along the verge of woodlands, while the sprightly notes of a thousand various birds, animated the scene with a brilliant luxuriance of life and cheerfulness. In the city, I could have access to these pleasures but in miniature. The greens, the groves, the fountains, were confined to a narrow tract of ground adjoining my father's mansion; still these, with my aviary, my drawing apparatus, and my library, served as a welcome relief to the monotonous rotation of courtly splendour. One day, as I was watering some flowers in the garden, my father came to me—“These are beautiful flowers, Selina,” said he. “Yes, Sir,” I replied, “such as my angel mother was extremely fond of.” The Baron sighed—“Your mother was an excellent woman, Selina; she is now, indeed, an angel.” “I hope so, Sir; I believe so.—She is now in Heaven.” He paused; and walked from me. After strolling for some time around the garden, he returned. I had gathered a bunch of flowers, and was assorting them as fancy dictated—“Are you preparing a boquette for Count Hubert?” said he, gaily. “For my flower-vase, Sir,” I replied smiling. “How do you like the Count?” he asked carelessly. “Very well, Sir,” I answered, “I believe he is a worthy man.” “Speak frankly, my daughter,” said my father with more earnestness, “do you love Hubert?” “Oh, no, Sir,” I returned, “I have never loved any person, except you, Sir, my lamented mother, my brother, and my sisters.” “Do you not, then, esteem the Count?” said he, fixing upon me an inquisitive eye. “Certainly I do;” I replied, “there are few, if any, I more highly esteem, except those I have mentioned.” “You have ever been a dutiful daughter, Selina,” said the Baron, tenderly, “and my wish is to see you happily settled in life, as are your sisters. You have lost an affectionate mother; the time may come when you will also be deprived of your father. Left parentless, you know not, you cannot anticipate what difficulties, what dangers, you may have to encounter. The Count Hubert honours us by offering you his hand; with a person of his rank and accomplishments, his wealth and eminence, you can scarcely fail of being happy. You regard him, perhaps love him, as he does you, with most sincere affection; at any rate, if nothing more, he is, as you have acknowledged, high in your estimation, and esteem will increase to love, when you become his wife. That romantic passion you read of in novels, seldom exists; and when experienced tends only to render its subjects miserable. Real love, as your favourite Gesner tells you, is founded, not in fancy, but in reason. I leave you to contemplate on what I have proposed; I demand no hasty decision, but at some short future day, shall expect your answer. In the mean time reflect,” he continued, with more ardency and emotion, “that in receiving the Count for your husband, you confer the highest felicity on him, ensure your own happiness and respectability, and in a very particular manner oblige an affectionate father.” Thus saying, he left me, and walked into the house. On retiring to my room I sat down, seriously to consider the Baron's observations. The proposition was as unexpected as sudden. Hubert had said many tender things to me; so had others; I esteemed them as nothing more than the effusions of gallantry and politeness. If he had been more expressive than others, I had scarcely noticed it, or, at least, not so as to have retained the impression. My father's remarks carried conviction. One parent I had lost; should the other be taken from me, where, then, would be my guide, my adviser, my protector? Count Hubert, I believed, was all my father had said of him. But I, then, knew not why, yet I shuddered at the thoughts of marriage. In some degree, it appeared synonimous with death. Both, to me, were future and untried states, which could be realized only by experience. True, we saw people marrying daily, and daily we saw people die; but until we, ourselves, marry or die, we cannot be certain that we have any correct ideas of the events produced by the change. Then I felt an extreme reluctance to leave the place of my nativity; I wished, a little longer, to linger among the scenes of my childhood, where mementos, dear to my remembrance, presented at every winding of an alley, every turning of an avenue. But did I really love Count Hubert? Not as I loved my parents, sisters, or my brother; but no man I had seen stood higher in my estimation. Esteem, my father said, would ripen into love, after we were joined in wed-lock. I placed no reliance on the extravagant tales I had read in romances, where love is depicted as pressing into its service, and often annihilating, every other passion of the soul. They were, I supposed, only the fictions of a luxuriant fancy, and existed nowhere but in the imagination. Then did not my sentiments respecting Hubert comprise all the affection necessary for the married state? I had been taught to love God for his goodness to me. Hubert had ever been good to me, and now, more particularly, manifested his tenderness by desiring to make me his own. I loved God— I loved Hubert. Pardon the comparison; such were then the crratic wanderings of my unsophisticated mind. I therefore came to the resolution of informing the Baron, whenever he should again mention the subject, that I would accept Count Hubert for a husband. I experienced a peculiar pleasure in this, as my father's last emphatic words still sounded in my ears, that thereby I should in a very particular manner oblige an affectionate parent. He had placed strong emphasis on the words “very particular manner,” but why he had done so, I knew not. Having formed this decision, I determined to carry it into effect; still the similarity between marriage and death would often strike me, and, at times, I thought I would as willingly have become a ghost as a bride. Count Hubert continued his addresses, and situated as I considered myself, I believed it not amiss to let him discover that I gave them preference. With this, my father I perceived, was highly pleased, and the Count did not confine his gratitude to silence. G My brother having received a military education, entered the army while young. A vigourous war, at that time existing, the field was his theatre, where he was advanced to the head of a regiment; but peace being concluded, he, about this time, returned to Vienna. He was a few years older than I, and between us had ever existed the tenderest affection. To him I related my situation respecting Hubert; he heard me with attention, and after pausing, replied, “I hope, Selina, you have critically examined your heart before you concluded to alter, for life, your condition.” The remark was impressive, but I could not tell why; I only answered that I thought I had. Several officers of the army were now introduced into our circle; among them was one of the same rank, about the same age, and a particular friend and intimate, of my brother. His father was an Englishman, who, on account of some troubles experienced in his own country, came over to try his fortune at Vienna, where he married a German lady, by whom he had but one child, who, being a son, he designed for an extensive liberal education. The boy was, therefore, put to school, accordingly, but before he attained the age of sixteen years, his mother died. The disconsolate father, soon after, entered the Austrian service, taking the youth with him; he, finally, fell in battle, leaving his son a soldier of fortune, without other patrimony than a sword and a lieutenancy, from which, by merit alone, he had risen to the rank of colonel. His name was Barker, which, to accommodate the German pronunciation, he had changed to Bergher. The manners and address of Bergher were pleasing and attractive; and as the officers of his grade were admitted, in the first circles, on equal grounds with the nobility, he was seldom absent from our parties; this, with the intimacy subsisting between him and my brother, gave him free access to my father's house. I did not consider it improper to treat my brother's friend, and a gentleman of Col. Bergher's character and standing, with particular politeness; he was, therefore, generally my escort and attendant, in the absence of the Count, to whom, however, he always gave place. But my mind soon began to discriminate, and draw comparisons between them. In the society of Bergher, my spirits were all cheerfulness and gaiety; the presence of Hubert cast a melancholy gloom over my feelings. If the former was away, I felt an uneasiness and an anxiety for his return; involuntarily I took an interest in his welfare; while the attentions of the latter became insipid and oppressive. Though I knew not the occasion of these impressions, yet I tried, but in vain, to resist them; still, I could not perceive that I was wrong in thus deducing inferences and forming conclusions from objects spontaneously forced upon my judgment and understanding, as my will could have no agency in the matter; yet I endeavoured to conceal the real state of my mind, and, for the first time in my life, experienced those painful sensations ever attending duplicity. The jealousy, however, of my stepmother, and the steady vigilance of the Count, did not permit me long to remain in my fancied security, the bitter consequences of which I soon encountered, with unusual severity. Du Ruyter, my brother, came to my chamber one day, and, with a soldier's frankness, thus accosted me: “Selina,” said he, “Bergher loves you, and if I am not mistaken, you do not feel perfectly indifferent towards him. If this be the case, neither Hubert's riches, nor his title, can make you happy. Does the Baron still continue to press the Count's suit?” “He has never spoken to me but once on the subject,” I answered. “Then possibly,” resumed Du Ruyter, “he may have relinquished his preference. The only advantage the Count can possess over Bergher, is property; with the Baron, this may be an important consideration, but so it ought not to be with you, when apprised that it is in my power to place you in independent circumstances, which, with great pleasure, I will do, should you be inclined to give your hand to my friend. I think I can readily perceive that, to Hubert, you have no tender attachments; nor is it surprising; if nothing else, the disparity of age is a sufficient objection to your union: you C 2 are not yet twenty years old; he is bordering on forty. There are other considerations, perhaps, more important: he is a man of a haughty and unyielding spirit. If my information be correct, he has not, at all times, treated your sex with suitable dignity, I believe, I might say, with proper delicacy; and if I understand his character and temper, they are not very happily cast, nor calculated to increase the felicity of the married state. Such are my sentiments; but should I have formed erroneous opinions, you will be candid enough to tell me so, and the matter shall end here. My desire is to see you happy, Selina; I will, therefore, only repeat my advice, that you consult well your own heart, and whatever may be your decision, I doubt not but our father may be persuaded to acquiesce in it. What says my sister; shall I await your answer?” While Du Ruyter was speaking, my blood circled with accelerated motion; I felt my cheeks glow, and with stammering embarrassment replied: “Does my brother act, in this affair, as the agent and by the request of his friend, or merely from motives of his own?” “In concert with all these,” he archly rejoined, “and, I cannot but hope, in unison with the feelings and sentiments, also, of another person.” Without raising my eyes from the floor, and glad to dismiss the subject, “Call again,” said I, “this evening, when, possibly, I may be better prepared to give an answer.” “And must I come alone?” he asked, quickly. “Alone, or not renew the subject,” I, as hastily, replied. “It shall be so,” he said, and departed. It was not until this moment that a true conviction of my real situation flashed upon me. I now perceived, and was surprised that I had not discovered before, the real difference of my sentiments, respecting the Count and Bergher. I rejoiced that the Baron had not, again, spoken to me on the subject of marriage, at a time, too, when my resolution was formed to comply with his wishes, and I deeply regretted having even tacitly given to the addresses of Hubert, the least encouragement. I reflected on Du Ruyter's generous proposal of sharing, with me, his fortune. I knew that, separate from patrimonial expectations, a large estate had devolved upon him by the death of an uncle, so that, should events render it necessary, it would be in his power to fulfil his benevolent intentions. But yet, I shuddered at the idea of acting counter to the will, or even the expectations of my father, and I much doubted whether he, or rather his lady, who now appeared, entirely, to govern him, would consent to relinquish prospects of grandeur and wealth, for what they would esteem plebeianism and poverty. The ensuing evening I was disappointed in the prospect of a private conversation with my brother, a large party calling in, unexpectedly upon us, and not retiring until a very late hour. Hubert was among them, and paid me, as I thought, attentions more than usually particular. It was impossible for me to receive them but with considerable coolness. Lady Du Ruyter was present, and I perceived my conduct did not escape her marked disapprobation. The next morning, soon after breakfast, I received a summons to attend the Baron in his closet, whither I immediately repaired. He received me cheerfully, and with accustomed tenderness. After some common conversation, he thus introduced the subject to which he had called my attention. “Hitherto,” said he, “Selina, I have forborne to renew a conversation I held with you some time since, respecting your alliance with the Count Hubert, because, if I have not mistaken appearances, your own inclinations preclude the necessity of my making use of any arguments in his favour; but as the Count is anxious for the completion of his joyful expectations, and experiencing a delicacy as to urging the matter himself, he has desired me to request your fixing the day of marriage, for which purpose I have sent for you here this morning.” My father paused—I was silent. “If,” he continued, “you are not already prepared to name the day, you may give me your answer this evening.” “In conformity to your choice, Sir,” said I, “I have admitted the Count's attentions; the same motives would induce me to receive him as my companion through life, could I do so consistent with my peace of mind.” “And is, then, a union with Hubert calculated to destroy your peace?” he inquired. “Most certainly it is,” I returned, “or I would not refuse him, since he is selected by you, Sir.” “This is strange,” he resumed, “strange indeed, that you should so soon have changed your mind, or rather, so suddenly discovered its versatility. You have gone too far to retract, Selina.” “How, gone too far, Sir?” I asked. “In actions, I mean,” he replied, “which are generally considered the most expressive language of the heart. By actions you have encouraged the Count's addresses; by actions you have declared that you preferred them to those of any other; by actions you have raised hopes and expectations, which, now, to defeat and disappoint, would be an insult of the most glaring nature, and involve your family in deep and dishonourable embarrassments. You must marry the Count, Selina.” “Would you, willingly, render your daughter for ever unhappy, Sir?” “No,” he answered, sighing; “and, therefore, I say, you must marry the Count. It is by following the wildfires of fancy that we render ourselves unhappy. You have said that you esteemed Hubert; I have told you that, in the married state, love will succeed esteem.” “My dear father,” I exclaimed, and my tears flowed, “I can never love the Count.” “Have you not tender attachments to some other person?” inquired he, hastily, and fixing a scrutinizing eye upon me. “I hope, Sir,” I rejoined, I may never be so unfortunate as to place my regards on one unworthy my father's approbation. “This is disingenuously evading my question, Selina,” he returned; “it is suspected that Col. Bergher has rivalled the Count in your affections, and that he has the presumption to aspire to your hand. I trust, you too highly value the honour and dignity of your family, ever to think of connecting yourself with a person of his station in life; but should you be so imprudent, remember that you never will obtain your father's consent to so degrading a union. Go now to your chamber; consider the matter well, and reflect on the consequences to be expected from disobedience to a parent, on whom rests all your earthly dependence.” I retired, not to deliberate reflection, but to weep. And now I firstly perceived the gloomy clouds of sorrow and affliction fast gathering over my future prospects. That day I had an interview with Du Ruyter, to whom I related all that had passed. He seemed not surprised, but appeared affected. After pausing, “This,” said he, “is the work of our new mother; I will have a conversation with the Baron relative to the subject.” On the effect of this conference, rested my hopes, as I knew my father placed great reliance on my brother's opinion. The next day, as I sat embroidering a tiara, Lady Du Ruyter came into the room, and, with more seeming complacency than she usually manifested towards me—“Selina,” she said, “that is a very beautiful head-dress; is it intended as a bridal ornament?” “It is for myself, Madam,” I replied. “So I supposed,” she returned; “and when is your marriage with Count Hubert to be celebrated?” “I did not know as that event had been determined.” “Not determined!” she exclaimed; “your marriage with Count Hubert not determined!” “Certainly not,” said I, “unless it be without my knowledge or consent.” H “Then I must have been misinformed by the Baron, your father.” “Did he inform you otherwise, Madam?” I asked. “Surely he did,” she answered, “and told me, too, that the wedding was soon to take place. I understand, also, that the Count considers you as his affianced bride.” “I have entered into no such affiances.” “But suppose your father has?” “He must, if he please, perform them.” “I should think,” she continued, “that however you may esteem the Baron's counsel and advice, you would scarcely have the confidence to resist his commands.” “I never have resisted them,” I returned, “and trust he will not give me occasion to dispute them, at least, if left to decide for himself.” “And he, only, ought to decide, in so momentous an affair as your establishment for life.” “When you married the Baron,” said I, “did you consult your own interests and feelings, or leave others to do it for you?” She reddened, bit her lips, and was for some time silent—“I, thereby, neither disappointed the expectations of my friends, nor dishonoured the name of my family,” she, tartly, replied. “I trust not,” I coolly rejoined, “and yet if all parties concerned had not approved the procedure, would you have acted differently?” The words “all parties,” I could perceive, galled her; for she well knew that the connexions of my father were decidedly opposed to the match. “I shall not condescend to dispute points with you,” returned she; “I am no stranger to your romantic predilection for Col. Bergher; but I presume the Baron will never permit you to disgrace his family, by casting yourself away on an untitled and moneyless adventurer.” “Then, I presume, the Baron is the fittest person to tell me so.” “You grow insolent, Miss.” “I hope not. I would wish to treat every person with due respect, whom my father may suppose entitled to it.” “Impudence! And by language like this-do you evince your respect to me?” “I sought neither this interview, Madam, nor the conversation resulting from it.” “But I did, Miss impertinence, and for the express purpose of apprising you, that unless you instantly consent to become the wife of Count Hubert, speedy measures will be taken to correct your taste, and to convince you that there is some little difference between a nobleman and a beggar.” With this keen faunt she left me, fury flashing from her eyes. Though my spirits, from irritation, perhaps, had been kept up, in the presence of Lady Du Ruyter, yes they sank the moment she retired, and a flood of tears burst from my eyes. I knew that this woman held unlimited influence over my father; that me she hated, and that from her I had nothing to expect but persecution; and as now she was extremely exasperated, I had reason to dread the consequences. I, therefore, anxiously waited the result of Du Ruyter's interview with the Baron. If my father's determination could, possibly, be changed, his son only could effect it. On this point rested my hopes; if it failed, then must I be dreadfully and irretrievably lost.</field>

It was not until the afternoon of the succeeding day, that I had an opportunity of discoursing with my brother; we then retired to the alcove in the garden, as previously agreed on, when he related the circumstances of his conversation with my father, as follows: “I have had a conference with the Baron,” said he, “and am now prepared to apprise you of his sentiments; his principal objection to Bergher arises from family pride; his preference of Hubert from another cause; by the imprudence of Lady Du Ruyter, he has become seriously involved in debt; to liquidate which, he has borrowed considerable sums of the Count, who engages to cancel them all, on the consummation of his marriage with you. I pointed out to our father, in as forcible language as I was capable of uttering, the impropriety of such a course; convinced him that it was in my power to relieve him from his present embarrassments; told him that I had, recently, purchased large estates in Saxony, on which I could, at any time, raise money sufficient to meet his exigencies; to this he listened with attention. I then expatiated upon the honourable and unsullied character of Bergher, whose only fault being a want of property, I had determined it should not operate to the unhappiness of my sister, while I possessed an income so much superior to my expenditures; and I pressed for his consent to your union with the man of your choice. He said he could not hastily decide, but would take the matter into consideration; I could perceive he was moved, and have the most sanguine hopes that he will, yet, act as becomes a tender and indulgent parent.” My brother's words gave me some consolation; still I was not without fears, on account of the malevolent disposition of my stepmother, and the ascendance I knew she held over the mind of my father. I had never acquired the art of disguising my feelings; Hubert readily saw the preference I gave to his rival; but he was a true courtier, and affected not to perceive it. He increased his assiduities and attentions, so that, unless in his presence, Bergher now saw me but seldom. As I was one morning descending to the breakfast parlour, I distinguished the voices of my brother and the Count, in an adjoining apartment; as they seemed in altercation, I paused to listen, and overheard the following laconic conversation: “Permit me, therefore,” said Du Ruyter, “to advise you to abandon a pursuit which can but distress its object, while you gain nothing thereby, except disappointment.” “And did your comrade delegate to your trust this important mission?” replied Hubert. “The mission is my own, Sir,” answered my brother, “and not executed without a view to your benefit.” “And what mighty boon does my benefactor propose, in case I submit to his terms?” rejoined the Count. “The estimation, or, at least, not the detestation, of a respectable family, and the reputation of acting discreetly,” returned my brother. “Why now this is something,” said the other; “it is something, indeed; but then I humbly intreat permission to dispense with your liberality, as a connexion or disconnexion with the family of Du Ruyter is not of stupendous consequence to the house of Hubert.” “Why then persist in those attentions which, you cannot but perceive, must have become not only displeasing, but oppressive?” said Du Ruyter. “To please my particular fancy, Sir.” “Then, though it should displease that peculiar fancy, I again advise you to desist.” “No one, the Baron excepted, can justly assume the privilege of imposing such advice.” “But suppose,” continued my brother, “I choose to assume that privilege, and therewith take the liberty of offering my opinion that the course you are pursuing is not honourable?” “Then would I treat that opinion with contempt,” retorted Hubert; “but considering it shielded by the brother of Selina, might extend severity no farther.” “Neither Selina, nor her brother,” returned Du Ruyter, “will claim lenity from the gallantry or the bravery of the mighty Hubert, nor will they grant him an additional privilege for the display of those rare qualities.” “Who, then, but a soldier,” exclaimed the Count, haughtily, “could be at a loss in determining the nice point your question embraces?” “This house,” my brother, spiritedly, replied, “has ever been a protection to all the guests of the Baron Du Ruyter.” “It is, indeed, a protection,” rejoined Hubert, quickly, “and therefore I exchange it for my lodgings at the Hotel du Val.” Perceiving him advancing, I glided away, tremblingly apprehensive that the consequence of what I had heard could be nothing less than a hostile interview. My brother appeared at breakfast, nor did he seem, in the least degree, agitated. Lady Du Ruyter inquired why the Count was not present; the Baron said he had excused himself on account of previous engagements. Business now called my father abroad for some days, and Du Ruyter attended him; during their absence, Hubert was almost our constant visitor; but I had the pleasure of observing that he attended more to the Baron's lady than to me; I was rejoiced to escape his addresses, by any means, for since the altercation I had overheard between him and my brother, he was more odious to me than ever. One morning, after I had engaged to ride out with Bergher, the Count invited me to take an airing in his chariot: I informed him that I was previously engaged. “Would it be improper,” he asked, “to inquire into the disposition of those engagements?” “By no means,” I answered: “a party of pleasure, Sir.” “Is it a civil or a military party?” he, sneeringly, inquired. “Civil, I trust, Sir,” I tartly replied, “unless some impertinent coxcomb should intrude himself among us.” With all his confidence, he coloured deeply at this retort. Recovering from his confusion— “You have an undoubted right to select your own parties, Madam,” he rejoined. “On that point, I require neither information nor instruction, Sir,” I returned. He stood a few moments as indecisive whether to prolong the conversation; then, with the forced smile of mortified pride, “My presence, I perceive, is unwelcome,” said he; “I will therefore retire.” As I made no reply, he withdrew, and for a season I suffered no farther persecution from his attentions; I could, however, perceive that my movements were strictly observed by himself and the Lady Du Ruyter. Returning, one evening, from a visit, I was informed, by the servant in waiting, that my father had arrived that afternoon. Bergher, who escorted me home, inquired for Du Ruyter; the servant said he had stopped at the seat of a neighbouring gentleman, and would be in town the next day. The Baron having retired to rest, I did not see him that night. Nor did he appear at breakfast the next morning; it was said he had rode out to his villa, about six miles from Vienna. About noon he returned, and immediately summoned me to a private audience; I found I him in his study; as soon as I entered, he shut the door, and began as follows: “I find, Selina,” said he, “that you have, not only, disregarded my counsel and advice, but have, also, disobeyed my strict injunctions, and most positive commands, by discarding the Count Hubert, and receiving, as your addresser, a man without property, fame, or character, except the slender appendages attached to the name and profession of a soldier; thus hazarding, by a single act of imprudence, not only your future peace and felicity, but the honour and reputation of your family; a family, dignified by an ennobled genealogy, to remotest ancestry.” “From a conversation with my brother,” I replied, taking the advantage of a pause, “I thought I had reason to expect that my father had relaxed in”— “Hear me out,” he sternly interrupted; “your brother, thoughtlessly fascinated by the semblance of honour, and blindly devoted to improper attachments, formed in the camp, is little better calculated to make correct distinctions than yourself; think not, therefore, that I shall relax in my determinations; for could I yield to your sacrificing your own happiness and respectability, I would never consent to receive, as my son-in-law, a man of Bergher's pretensions. Attend, then, my final decision—You must either abandon Bergher, and marry the Count, or your father will abandon you.” Sinking on my knees and bursting into tears, I besought him to retract so harsh a decree. “Grant me, my father,” said I, “but one request; permit me to remain single, and I solemnly promise to obey you in all things: I will engage not to see the face of a single person without your express approbation. But I cannot—O my only parent!—it is utterly impossible—I can never—never consent to marry Count Hubert.” “Obstinate and perverse girl,” he passionately exclaimed, “hear then the doom that awaits you; I shall prescribe your walks to narrow limits, nor will you be permitted even to go out without suitable attendance; know, also, that the unworthy object of your affections is forbidden, ever hereafter, to set his foot within these walls.” He then commanded me to retire, without reply. With feelings not to be described I withdrew to my room, where I passed the day in the most excruciating anguish of mind. I was now convinced that my brother's prospects of reconciling the Baron to reason had failed; I must consent to become the wife of a man I despised, or forfeit the tenderness of my only remaining parent, for ever; by either of which my future days would be rendered miserable. In the afternoon Du Ruyter came to my chamber: “I find you distressed, my sister,” said he, as he entered, “and I well know the occasion. I have been made acquainted with every circumstance. Our father's will, when correctly ascertained, we ought, if reasonable, to obey; in the present instance he does not act of himself, but by the advice, and under the immediate influence of his lady; to her authority we are not bound to submit, especially when it tends to destroy our peace, as in the case we now experience. Your situation has become critical and interesting; Bergher's visits here are interdicted; you are watched, nay, already guarded as a prisoner; unless you consent to marry the Count you will be still more oppressed, and most rigourously persecuted. I have learnt, since my return, that, to keep you completely in restraint, and out of the reach of Bergher, you are soon to be sent, secretly, to the Baron's villa in the country, where no one is to have access to you except Hubert, and the attendants, your guards; the Baron has been there this morning to give orders for an apartment to be fitted up for your reception. In this dilemma, what course are we to pursue?” “Advise me,” I exclaimed, “advise me, O my brother! I must rely on your counsel, for I know not what to do, and have no one else to consult; but death itself is preferable to a union with Hubert.” “You shall never be united to him,” he returned, “if I have power to prevent it, and for that purpose I have a proposition to make, which demands your attentive consideration.” “What is it?” I eagerly asked. I 2 “To marry Bergher,” he replied. I gazed at him with astonishment. “Be not surprised,” said he, “at the proposal of a secret marriage; your have no other way of escape; you must be Bergher's or Hubert's; the only alternative is wretchedness and a prison. My plan is, that after your union you retire, privately, with your husband, to Saxony, where you can reside on my estates until I have made your peace with the Baron, which I am confident I can do, when he experiences the effects of your absence, reflects on his own conduct, and perceives farther perseverance therein useless and vain. Trust me, Selina, I know the temper of our father; of the impropriety of Lady Du Ruyter's advice and behaviour he must shortly be convinced. His affection for his children is powerful, and will soon return; a reconciliation will then be effected, your pardon granted, and with your consort you will be honourably restored to favour and to felicity.” To paint the agitation of my mind, various and fluctuating, would be impossible. But it was indispensible that I should come to a speedy decision; and on what could I decide but the course my brother had advised? To be deserted by my only parent perhaps I might have borne; but to be given up the prisoner of the man I detested was horror; was worse, far worse, than immediate death. It is needless for me to detail— The succeeding night, after the family were all at rest, I was united to Bergher in my own apartment. No one was present except Du Ruyter and his chaplain, who married us; not even my woman was entrusted with the secret. As it was necessary to make arrangements for my departure, which Du Ruyter informed me must soon take place, I was the next morning preparing to go out to purchase a few articles I wanted, when an order came from the Baron forbidding my leaving the house, and directing me to hold myself in readiness to proceed, on the morrow, into the country; I shuddered at the mandate, and instantly sent for my brother. Soon as he understood the matter, “Be not alarmed,” said he, “we have only to use a little more despatch; our project must be carried into effect this very night. Can you trust your maid?” “I believe her to be honest, and firmly attached to me,” I answered. “Ply her liberally with this,” said he, presenting me with a purse; “see if she can be trusted, and if you find her faithful, let her into your secret; I will be with you again in an hour.” He then departed. I called up my maid, and told her she must go out and purchase a few articles at the shops; “and here is money,” I continued, “to buy yourself a new dress; or what else you choose.” “Thank you, Ma'amselle,” said she, curtseying, “you are always so good.” “So long as you are a good girl I shall do well by you,” said I. “You always have, Ma'am; I hope I may never be so unlucky as to displease you,” she returned. “I think you love me, do you not, Doria?” I said, carelessly. “La! Ma'amselle,” she replied, “how can you ask such a dreadful queer question? Love you, Ma'am! If I thought you doubted it I should die of vexation.” “I do not doubt it, but I am in distress, Doria,” I rejoined. “I know it, Ma'amselle,” she answered, “I know all about it; there's Catreen, my Lady's maid, told me the other day, says she, `don't you think,' says she, `now there's Ma'amselle Selina refuses the Count, and wishes to marry the Colonel, though the latter isn't worth a stiver.' And so would I, says I, for the Count is old and ugly, says I, but the Colonel is young and handsome, but”— “Well, Doria,”— “Well, Ma'am, to day the Count's valley de sham, said to me, says he, `So, Doria, your mistress,' meaning you, Ma'amselle, `doesn't like the cut of my master's face, I understand; but she will soon have a chance to see it oftener, and will then, perhaps, esteem it better,' and”— “Did the Count's man tell you so, Doria?” “Indeed, he did, Ma'am, and I told him to hold his impertinent tongue, and go about his business, and”— “Doria,” said I, “you must assist me. I can no longer stay under this roof; my father, or rather his lady, is determined I shall marry the Count, and they intend I shall be removed tomorrow to some place of confinement, until I consent to their wishes; this night, therefore, I am to depart, with my brother, to some safe place, where we are to remain until matters can be reconciled. If you will attend me you shall be richly rewarded, and provided for during life.” “Attend you, Ma'amselle,” she replied, “that I will, through the world, if you'll permit me; and really I shall be greatly rejoiced to get away from this troublesome house, for my lady has grown so testy and captious, that, at best, she leads us a miserable life.” “You may now go, Doria,” said I, “and do as I have told you, but be cautious that not a suspicious word escapes you; I shall be for ever ruined and wretched if our scheme should be discovered.” “Never fear me, Ma'amselle,” said she, as she went out, “I defy them to get any thing from me.” Du Ruyter soon returned, when our affairs were thus arranged: He was to retire to rest at the usual family hour, which, as it was Saturday, would be early; after all were asleep, he was to arise and open a passage for me into the garden, by leaving the doors unbarred. One hour after midnight he would meet me with his coach at the garden gate, from whence I could make my escape. Bergher was to join us at some little distance on the road, when we were to proceed, with all possible despatch, to Saxony. My preparations were rapid, and soon completed. My best apparel was put up in a small trunk; my money and jewels were deposited in a casket. I then waited impatiently for the appointed hour. Night came on, and, to me, rolled heavily away. About ten o'clock, my maid, who had been below, returned and handed me a note, which she said she had received from my brother's footman; I broke the seal, and read as follows: “Circumstances, my dear sister, render it necessary to change the order of our arrangements; I will explain them to you when we meet. Be at the garden gate at twelve, instead of one o'clock, where you will find the coach, with proper attendants, ready to receive you. Let not your voice be heard by those who escort you. Fear nothing; I will join you a few miles from town. “T. DU RUYTER.” This note excited my liveliest apprehensions; I feared our plan was discovered, or at least suspected. With increased impatience I waited till within a quarter of an hour of twelve; at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the gate; a universal tremour seized me; the knocking continued with violence; at length the porter was aroused; I heard him unlock the door and go out; he soon after returned with some person in his company; they entered the house, and again the door was locked. No one ascending the stairs, I ordered my maid to go and make observations; she shortly came back and informed me that it was only the steward, who had been out on business; I entertained not the least doubt but that he had been making preparations for my confinement at the villa, and at that moment I felt as if released from chains and a dungeon. But it was at least three quarters of an hour before the house became silent; we then ventured down, my woman carrying the trunk, and I the casket. We passed silently along the apartments, through the outer door, and soon reached the appointed place; the coach was waiting, into which I was handed by an attendant, who seated himself beside me; my maid followed, the doors were closed, and we were driven rapidly away, the servants following on horseback, as outriders. The night was gloomy and dark; heavy folding clouds rolled along the horizon; lightning flashed through the atmosphere, and thunder roared at no great distance. My feelings were in unison with nature; my K spirits were depressed; melancholy had spread itself over my soul. I soon began to grow uneasy on account of Du Ruyter's not joining us; but as his note had directed me to be silent, not a word was spoken. We had now proceeded far from the city; my anxiety increased; I could preserve silence no longer. Turning towards the man who sat near me, in a low voice I asked, “Where is my brother?” Receiving no answer, I more audibly repeated the question; a broad and bright flash of lightning, at that instant, gave me a full view of the features of the person I addressed; heavens! what were my sensations when I perceived it to be the Count Hubert! “My God!” I exclaimed, “I am betrayed!” and sprang towards the door of the coach. “You are saved,” cried he, seizing hold of me, “from the seductions of an impostor.” I shrieked, and struggled with all my might; as I broke from his grasp, I heard the rattling of a carriage advancing towards us; I burst one of the doors, and cried out, “For God's sake, rescue the daughter of Baron Du Ruyter from the villain Hubert!” The carriage stopped directly before us; by the light of the coach-lanterns, I saw a person leap out, and knock our postillion from his seat.—“Base miscreant!” exclaimed a voice, “release my sister, or you instantly die!” It was the voice of Du Ruyter! “We meet sooner than I expected,” returned Hubert, rushing from the chariot, “but not too soon for vengeance.” They both fired, and both fell! I flew to the spot, sank, and fainted upon the body of my brother. How long I continued in that situation I knew not; when I revived, or, at least, when correct sensation returned, I found myself on a sort of couch, surrounded by a number of peasant-looking people of both sexes. The room was small, and the furniture of the coarsest materials. I stared wildly around, unable at first to assemble ideas sufficient to conjecture where I was, or remember what had been my situation; but recollection soon came, and with it all the horrors of the past night, for I now perceived, by the light of a small, solitary window, that it was day. Raising myself up, “Oh! my murdered brother!” I involuntarily murmured; they all retired to an adjoining apartment, except an elderly female, who advised me to lie down and compose myself. I leaned back, and she seated herself by my bed. The door communicating with the other room was open, so that I could distinctly hear the conversation which passed. “Was the lady's brother murdered?” asked some one, in a low voice. “All I can tell you of the matter,” replied another, “is this; my wife, who can never sleep during a thunder storm, awaked me in the night; I got up, lighted a lamp, and stepped out to look at the weather; while I stood there, I heard a loud screaming, and then the report of fire-arms; I called up my son William, we armed ourselves with bludgeons, and taking each of us a lantern, hastened to the great road, from whence, as we judged, the noise proceeded; reaching it, we paused and looked around, but nothing was to be seen, and we were about to return, when we heard a faint groan; on searching farther, we discovered the lady, lying near the road, dead, as we thought, or dying, for there was a good deal of blood on the ground; we conveyed her to the house; as also a small box we found in the road, which probably belonged to some of the company. I suppose the party were attacked by highway robbers; but what became of the rest, whether they escaped, were taken, or killed and carried off, I know not.” From this short narration I could learn nothing. My thoughts ranged through a wilderness of conjecture. What had become of my brother's body? what of my maid? how happened it that I was left on the field? how came I in the power of Hubert? Inexplicable mystery involved the whole transaction. The small box the peasant had mentioned, I supposed to be my casket, which probably dropped from my hand when I left the coach. The voice which had been speaking seemed familiar to my ear; nor was I mistaken; for when the speaker again entered my room, I discovered him to be a person I had frequently seen in the city, selling fruit and garden sauce, by which he supported his family; his name was Driscol. I heard him whisper the woman who sat by me, and who was his wife—“I am going out,” said he; “take K 2 good care of the lady, and if she gets her senses, find out who she is, that her friends may be informed of her situation.” I had probably raved on recovering from my swoon, and they supposed me still delirious. Fancying me asleep, his wife quit my bed-side as Driscol went out; the people, doubtless the neighbouring cottagers, who had collected on the alarm, departed also. Left alone, uninterrupted reflection poured upon me; alas! how poignant and severe! What fate next awaited me? What had become of Bergher? He knew not where to seek me. What could I do—what course adopt? Return to the city? Impossible, after the scenes which had passed; to remain where I was, equally impracticable. Should I confide to Driscol and his wife my situation? What could they do for me? Perhaps betray me to my father and to Hubert. Agitated, irresolute, my mind distracted by a thousand contending emotions, I lay in extreme anguish, when Driscol re-entered the adjoining apartment.—“Sad work, wife,” said he, “among the great folks.” “Aye,” returned she, “that is often the case. But what work do you mean, husband?” “Why it seems,” answered Driscol, “that Col. Bergher and Count Hubert both wanted to marry the daughter of Baron Du Ruyter. She and her brother were in favour of the former; the Baron and his lady of the latter; last night the Colonel—no—the Count, attempted to carry her off; her brother, in endeavouring to prevent it, was shot dead by the Count, who was also wounded in the fray, and in the end paid dear enough too for the scrape; for this morning the Colonel and he met; they fought, and the Count was run through the heart; but the worst of all is to come; the Colonel was taken and carried to prison, and will certainly be hung or beheaded; there can be no hopes of pardon, you know, for a person who kills one of the royal blood, and the Count was nearly related to the Emperor. Zounds! had William been there the Colonel would not have been very easily taken; William, you know, was a Sergeant in his regiment at the battle of — I forget the name of the place; but William would spill the last drop of his blood for Col. Bergher; he thinks him one of the best men in the universe.” “But what became of the lady?” asked his wife. “Oh, that I had like to forgot,” he replied; “the lady cannot be found, though they have hunted for her every where, and are hunting yet; I saw one of the men who was in pursuit of her.” “And who knows,” said the woman, “but that she is now under our roof?” “The same thing popp'd into my head,” returned Driscol, “so I wouldn't tell the man any thing about what had happened, though he made strict inquiry”— I heard no more.—This intelligence only was wanting to complete my wretchedness. I groaned in agony—stupefaction seized my senses; it was but of short duration; by so rapid a succession of distressing events, the powers of my soul were rendered too elastic to remainlong in one position. I awoke to the calmness of despair; Driscol and his wife were near me; “If,” said the former, “you are the daughter of Baron Du Ruyter, let us know it; perhaps we can assist you.” “I am,” said I, “and also the wife of Bergher; but you cannot help me; no mortal power can give me aid.” “I can try, however,” he returned, and went hastily out, calling for William. I arose, and walked to the window. I recollected it was the Sabbath, a day I had ever venerated, and strictly solemnized. The sun was setting, and cast his expiring, yellow rays, on the green prospect around; I viewed it without emotion; no throb agitated my bosom; no pang tortured my heart. I felt as if treading in air. The good woman of the house urged me to take some refreshment; I complied, and sat down with her at the table; I was thirsty, and drank plentifully of tea; I ate freely, but of what, to this moment I know not. We were both silent, for to speak I do not believe was in my power. I returned to my room, and to the window; darkness gradually came on, shade deepening into shade, till every object was veiled in total obscurity. I then traversed the apartment for some time; exhausted at length, I flung myself on the couch, and soon sunk into a profound sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. From friends we fly, from parents and from home, Through distant lands and unknown realms we roam; By adverse fate, compell'd strange worlds to rove; All joy, all consolation lost, but love. Lester. When I awoke, Driscol, his wife, and two other persons, were standing near my bed; I raised myself up, and in an instant was locked in the arms of Bergher! “We must fly, Selina,” said he, while my tears copiously flowed; “we must fly this moment, languid as I perceive you are, or, by lingering, we involve not only ourselves, but this worthy family, in inevitable destruction.” “Oh, Bergher! by what strange miracle have you been liberated?” I asked. “By this generous man and his son,” he replied, “who have hazarded their lives to save mine; stop not to inquire farther; you shall soon know all.” Then taking a large purse of gold, he emptied it on the table; the family would have prevented him, but he persisted; “this is but a small compensation for your goodness,” he said, “would to God I could bestow on you an empire!” “See if this be not your box;” said dame Driscol, presenting me my casket, “it was found with you on the road last night.” “It is,” I answered; “how shall we express our gratitude for all your kindness?” “Stay not to thank us,” replied William, “your bounty has already enriched us.” “Farewel, my valued friends,” said Bergher, “may blessings ever attend you; and you, my brave soldier,” he continued, turning to William, “receive this as your Colonel's final gift.” It was a captain's commission in the regiment of Bergher, at his disposal, and which, by the laws of the realm, could not be revoked but by the delinquency of the incumbent. They then attended us to the door; alternate gripes of hands were the last, sad, silent, but eloquently affectionate, adieus. A chaise was waiting; we entered it and drove off; at that instant we heard the clattering of horses' hoofs, driving up to the cottage; “There, said I, are the officers of justice in search of us.” “Be not alarmed,” returned Bergher, “as they will not find us with Driscol, our preservers will never be injured, and the party know nothing of our flight.” We soon gained the high road and quickened our speed. It was a dark starlight night; we had not proceeded far before some one, a few rods in front of us, hailed “who comes there?” The challenge being disregarded, the person fired his piece, sprang forward, and seized the bridles of the horses. This proved to be a signal, for immediately we saw a number of armed men with flambeaux issue from an adjoining house. The moment was critical—Bergher, though possessed of arms, had not time to use them; rising and bending forward, with the stock of his whip he aimed a blow at the fellow's head; the stroke was instantaneous and effectual; the man sunk to the ground, and the horses, freed from the encumberance, darted forward with I the velocity of eagles. Several shot were fired; the balls whistled around us. We soon heard shouting from behind, and horsemen swiftly pursuing us. Coming to a by-path, we turned into it, and the party speedily passed us, keeping on the main road. “Scouts,” said Bergher, “must have been far extended, and in every direction, to intercept us, as Driscol's cottage is at least eight miles from Vienna; but, thanks to Heaven, I think we are now safe.” The path we had taken was uneven and narrow, which obliged us to advance slowly and with caution; we knew not whither it tended; it wound along on the verge of a woody precipice, descended into a valley overspread with low shrubbery, then entered a deep, dark, and apparently an extensive forest. I shall never forget, yet never can I describe my feelings, while traversing this vast solitude, amidst the darkness and stillness of night. Recently escaped from so many and such mighty perils; suddenly restored to the arms of a beloved husband, whom I supposed for ever lost, yielded consolations I could neither sufficiently prize nor properly express; yet they were melancholy: the fate of a brother, dear as the blood which mantled about my heart, hung with heaviness and deep affliction upon my soul. As the carriage rolled leisurely along, I leaned upon the bosom of now my only earthly friend and protector, indulging sad reflection, and listening to the hollow winds as they sighed amidst the trees, the solemn roar of distant waters, or to the rapid song of the solitary night-bird, as it echoed among the rocky nooks and caverns of the surrounding wilderness. Suddenly we were alarmed by the sound of a French horn, far in our rear; we immediately conjectured that some of the men in quest of us had taken the road we were travelling; nor were we mistaken; they gained upon us apace; every sound of the horn approached nearer, and we soon distinguished the thundering of their horses' feet. “At length,” said I, “we shall be overtaken when there is no hope of escape.” “Providence has hitherto preserved us,” replied Bergher; “let us not despair; here is an opening in the wood, thither we can turn aside until our pursuers have passed.” He alighted and led the carriage along a narrow glade until we came to a small thicket, behind which we concealed ourselves. The party quickly came up, and halted directly against us. “We must search every corner,” said one them; “here seems to be a path leading into the forest; see if it can be traced.” A horseman immediately rushed into the opening, but soon being entangled with the brush, “There is no path here,” cried he; “let us not waste time, but drive on to the next village; if we do not there overtake them they must still be behind us.” He then rejoined his companions, and they galloped off. Thus were we again providentially relieved from the most dreadful apprehensions. Still imminent danger attended us; should we directly proceed on our journey we must probably meet the party returning; to remain where we were would be hazardous, as believing us in their rear, they would doubtless scour the forest in every passable direction; the latter course, however, could only be adopted with any prospect of safety. Day was dawning, and its light soon enabled us to seek for a place of greater security: this it was not easy to find; but at length we discovered a ledge of high rocks standing at a little distance from each other, thickly surrounded with low branching trees; thither, with much difficulty, the carriage was dragged and crowded in between the rocks, where we remained concealed, within sight of the road. “About noon we saw the troop returning; they passed us with a slow and silent pace, probably expecting to meet and surprise us unawares; soon as they were out of hearing we repaired to the road and proceeded on our journey. Within about half an hour, as we began to emerge from the forest into a more open and cultivated country, we saw a hussar advancing towards us at full gallop; in passing us I 2 he checked his speed, and examined us with scrutinizing particularity; then turning his horse, he rode up to the carriage and ordered us to halt; I trembled exceedingly; no sooner had we stopped, than advancing to the side of the chaise—“From whence are you?” he demanded. “From Vienna,” was the reply. “And whither bound?” “On a journey.” “You must return with me, Sir.” “Why return, and by whose orders?” Bergher asked, sternly. “By the orders of the Emperor,” replied the soldier. “Horsemen are out on every road, with directions to intercept and bring in all travellers. Of the party on this route I have the command; my men are a few miles in advance. The object is to seize a desperate villain who last night broke from prison, a deserter, a murderer, who has disgraced the rank of Colonel, and dishonoured the appellation of a soldier—one Bergher.” Quick as lightning Bergher rose upon his feet, and snatching a pistol from his side-pocket, presented it at the breast of the officer—“Behold the man you seek,” said he; “surrender yourself his prisoner, or instant death awaits you.” There was no room for parley: the officer delivered his pistols. “Your sword, Sir,” demanded Bergher. The sword was yielded up. As Bergher turned to place them in the carriage, the officer plunged his spurs into the horse's sides, and darted off with great rapidity; in descending a hill his horse fell, dashing him to the ground with violence; we hastened to the spot; he lay apparently lifeless. Bergher raised and laid him on a bank by the way-side; shortly he began to breathe convulsively; but though life returned, reason had fled; he groaned, stared vacantly, and murmured incoherently. On examination, a deep contusion appeared on his head, an arm was fractured, and blood flowed occasionally from his mouth. While considering how to dispose of him, we saw a waggon approaching, in which were a peasant and a lad. For a small sum they consented to take charge of the maimed officer, his horse and accoutrements, and return with them to the village, from whence they came, distant, they said, about ten miles in advance. As they were placing the hussar in the waggon, Bergher asked the peasant if there were any soldiers stationed at his village. “O yes,” said he, “a regiment or two, and they were all called out this morning to guard the passes, in order, they say, to seize an officer who first murdered a nobleman and then deserted. Who knows but I have the very fellow in my waggon? a lucky hit if it should be, as a large reward is offered for his head, dead or alive.” “Are there any by-roads between this place and the village?” Bergher inquired. “None,” replied the peasant, and immediately set off at a slow pace with the hussar, who still remained senseless. What course now to take we could not possibly devise. To recede or advance appeared equally perilous. To escape the vigilance of our pursuers seemed impossible. One difficulty was no sooner vanquished, one obstacle surmounted, than another, superior in magnitude, arose to obstruct and arrest our purposes and exertions. While we stood hesitating whether to advance or retreat, we saw the lad, who was mounted on the officer's horse, returning; “My father,” said he, when he came up, “forgot to tell you of a road which a few miles ahead turns off to the right, and runs over the big mountain; you must not take that, for it leads a great way from the village into a wild part of the country.” Rejoiced at this intelligence, we thanked the lad for the information, who turned and followed the waggon. We passed on, and soon perceiving the by-road, entered and pursued it; it was stony and rugged, leading into woody, unfrequented parts, uninhabited except by the tenants of a few scattering cottages; at one of these, which exhibited a more decent appearance than the rest, we stopped towards evening to obtain refreshment, which we much needed. Fruit, eggs and milk were set before us. We rested about half an hour, then proceeded, and soon arrived at the foot of the mountain mentioned by the peasant boy. By a long, gradual ascent, hedged on each side with impenetrable shrubbery, we reached the top: from its craggy summit, which arrested the course of careering clouds, the eye extended over an immeasurable space of wilderness and cultivation, picturesque and romantic in the extreme. As we passed along our ears were frequently stunned by the piercing screeches of the cormorant, as it pounced upon its prey in an adjoining lake; the harsh croakings of the raven, winging to his nightly covert, or the sonorous voice of the solitary eagle, soaring high above our heads, or hovering among the loftiest cliffs. Frequently the defenceless hare bounded across our path, closely pursued by the rapacious wolverene; and sometimes our attention was fixed by the adventurous wild goat, browsing on the extreme point of some giddy eminence, where human foot had never imprinted its vestige. Descending into the plain beneath, we entered upon a more broad and level road. Fearing pursuit, we continued our course through the night, and the next day, as evening was setting in, we espied a farm-house off the road, to which we drove and inquired for an inn. There was none within several miles. “Can you direct us where we can find entertainment for the night?” asked Bergher. “Not near at hand,” replied the rustic, “but if you will accept of farmer's fare you shall be welcome here.” Joyfully we closed with the invitation, and after supper retired to rest for the first time during our journey. Early the next morning, with many thanks, we took leave of our host and set forward, travelling for several days, resting a short time in the night, until at length we learned with satisfaction that we were out of the Emperor of Germany's dominions. Wearied and exhausted as we were by the misfortunes and hardships we had encountered, we concluded to remain a few days at a neat little town where we arrived, as well to restore our harrassed and wasted spirits, as to form some plan for future safety. Hitherto escape from impending danger had been our only object; hence no system was arranged, self-preservation alone being consulted. During the rapid succession of past events, time was not admitted to consider what course we should take; we readily adopted that which appeared best calculated to favour our flight, without inquiring or regarding whither it led, so that it conducted us beyond the reach of the meditated vengeance of our adversaries. The money which Bergher had brought with him amounted to no inconsiderable sum; I had likewise a plentiful supply, which at different times had been given me by my father, my brother, and a legacy left me by my mother: my casket of jewels, also, was very valuable; so that we were not apprehensive of soon being in want; but our treasure would not always last; our capital, or at least a part of it, must be so arranged as to be gaining a percentage, or in time it would waste away, and leave us helpless and hopeless; for on our own exertions we were hereafter to rely, having now no friends to whom we could ever make our future situation known. Some large and populous city, it was considered, would be the most favourable to our views, both as it respected concealment and the chance of some speculation, whereby to preserve, if not to increase our finances; Paris was finally fixed on as the most eligible. The preservation of my casket, on that dreadful night when I was entrapped by the wretch Hubert, was a fortunate circumstance: as I carried it in my hand, I must have dropped it when in the distress and agony of my mind I flew from the coach to the bleeding body of my brother. My trunk, containing every article of dress I brought with me, except those I had on, was probably carried away in the carriage. Bergher was enabled in some degree to elucidate the mystery with which preceding occurrences were enveloped. In consequence of the altercation I had overheard between my brother and Hubert, a hostile interview M was agreed upon, so arranged as to take place when Du Ruyter should have returned from his proposed journey with us to Saxony. The friends, or seconds of the parties, were a Col. Hembold and a brother of Hubert. The night I left my father's house Du Ruyter, soon as he perceived the family at rest, commenced the execution of his plan by opening the doors and gates for my escape; he then ordered his coach, and attended by three servants, called on Bergher at his lodgings and accompanied him to the place, a few miles from town, where he was to await our arrival. Finding it too early to meet me according to appointment, he said he would drive out about ten miles from town, and pass an hour with a friend. Bergher ordered his servant to attend him. Returning by a circuitous route, it was merely by chance they fell upon the road Hubert had taken. What happened when they met has been already stated. Soon as my brother fell, Bergher's man fled hastily to his master: the account he gave, though somewhat confused, was sufficiently alarming: he had heard my cries for assistance, witnessed the rencounter between the Count and Du Ruyter, but saw only the latter fall. On receiving this intelligence Bergher seized his sword and pistols, armed his servant, and taking a chaise, hurried to the spot. Day began to appear when they reached the place; nothing was discovered but marks of blood; they reasonably conjectured that my brother's servants had removed his body, and suspected that I was the prisoner of Hubert at his country-seat a few miles distant; thither Bergher directly proceeded, and arrived there soon after the sun had arisen. Leaving the carriage in the court-yard with his man, he knocked for admittance; a spruce French laquey opened the door, and obsequiously demanded “vat his honeur vil please to be vant?” “Lead me to the Count Hubert,” said Bergher. “If your honeur vil please send up your address, me vil return in von tree minute,” replied the valet. “I will present that address myself,” returned Bergher. “Monsieur le Count has given le special ordeur,” rejoined the other, “dat no persone be admit, unless he be so previously announce.” Bergher quickly drew his sword—“Lead, me, this moment,” said he, sternly, “to your master; and be cautious how you make any mistake or alarm: if you deviate in the least from this command, I will immediately cleave you in twain.” This argument was too powerful to be resisted; the servant, cringing and trembling, led the way along several rooms, up a winding flight of stairs, and through an extended suit of apartments, till approaching a chamber, he pointed to a closed door, “Dat be le saloon,” said he, in a whisper, “but la door be bolt, Monsieur.” At that moment, a woman's voice was heard within. Bergher listened and distinguished the following words: “It was not so much the promise of money, your honour, as in obedience to the commands of Lady Du Ruyter, and to prevent my mistress from running away with that handsome beggarly Colonel, that I betrayed her to your honour.” “You have done right,” replied a voice, which Bergher knew to be Hubert's, “and shall be well rewarded, though unfortunately our scheme has proved”— Bergher instantly set his foot against the door and burst it open. The Count was sitting in an easy chair; a bandage was around his head; Doria, my woman, was leaning on a desk which stood near him. Soon as Bergher appeared, the Count started wildly, and sprang upon his feet; my maid flew screaming from the room— “Villain!” exclaimed Bergher, “restore the daughter of Baron Du Ruyter to liberty!” Seizing an unsheathed sword which lay on the desk—“Villain, back to thy heart, base-born wretch!” cried Hubert, rushing furiously upon Bergher. While parrying each other's thrusts, the servants suddenly entered, one of whom M 2 reached the Count a pistol, which he immediately aimed at the heart of his antagonist, but before he could discharge it, received the sword of the latter in his breast and fell. Bergher was overpowered, disarmed, and secured by the Count's people, conveyed to prison, and thrown into a dungeon; his man followed him, but was refused admittance. With astonishment I now perceived, from what Bergher related, that my woman had indeed betrayed me. By the intrigues of Lady Du Ruyter and the Count, she had doubtless been won over to their interest, and bribed as a spy upon my actions. She unquestionably apprised them of my intended flight with my brother, which they readily foresaw must have some connexion with Bergher. Hence they contrived to defeat our purpose, and to throw me into the power of Hubert. The note, which my maid pretended to have received from Du Ruyter's footman, on the night of my elopement, signed with my brother's name, changing our plan of arrangement to an earlier hour than had been previously agreed upon, was undoubtedly the forgery of the Count, to gain time and opportunity for carrying his designs into effect before Du Ruyter should arrive. Learning from Doria the time appointed for the arrival of my brother's coach, he therefore fixed one hour earlier, which would leave room sufficient to execute his purpose unmolested; but the interruption occasioned by the return of the Baron's steward, delayed my departure to within about twenty minutes of the hour when my brother was to be at the garden gate. The forged note enjoined my silence, to prevent a possibility of discovery. Hence, when I reached the place of destination, I was, by the Count himself in the disguise of an attendant, handed, not as I expected and supposed into my brother's, but, into Hubert's coach, which taking the same road when Du Ruyter was then casually returning, produced, when they met, the events I have previously related. Such were the convictions which flashed upon my mind from the information given by Bergher. His finding my woman with the Count, and the conversation he overheard between them, were convincing evidence of the facts. To Hubert's unfinished sentence, when he promised Doria she should be well rewarded, though unfortunately their “scheme had proved”—he would probably have added, unsuccessful, had not Bergher interrupted it by forcing the door. The bandage around the Count's head was doubtless in consequence of the wound he received in the conflict with Du Ruyter. How it happened that I was left on the place where the rencounter occurred was still inexplicable; the Driscols might have been seen approaching with lights; Hubert, possibly deprived of sensation, was hurried away by his servants, while the body of my brother was borne off by his own people. In so much tumult and sudden confusion, it could not be surprising that I should be neglected. The prison to which Bergher had been committed was strictly guarded. As some state criminals of distinguished connexions were confined therein, the different cells and apartments were visited every half hour by the officers of the guard, to see that all was safe. Frequently, therefore, had the massy door of his dungeon grated upon its creaking hinges; at length he heard the bolts withdrawn more rapidly than usual, the door quickly flew open, and William Driscol stood before him. While unrivetting his chains, William gave him information concerning me. They then extinguished the lamp which hung glimmering in the cell, and departed from the prison, locking the doors after them. At the outer gate stood old Driscol, who received the keys from his son in silence: William and Bergher passed on until they came to a by place, where the latter found his man waiting with the chaise; wishing no farther to involve his faithful servant in the perilous state of his affairs, he dismissed him with a liberal donation; his sword and pistols, which his man had reclaimed of the Count's people, were in the carriage. In a few minutes the elder Driscol rejoined them, and they hastily set off for the cottage; before they reached the distance of half a mile from the prison, they heard the alarm guns fired, which are always kept ready for the occasion; by this they knew that the escape was discovered by the visiting officers, and that swift parties of horse would be immediately sent out in all directions to intercept the roads and arrest the fugitive. When they arrived at the cottage I was asleep, or rather lost in a delirious stupour. What succeeded, I have already detailed. Driscol, it appears, was intimately acquainted with the soldiers who guarded the prison; he had been a soldier himself, and still delighted in their company; he had often held gala-day with them at their quarters, frequently visited them at the guard-house; sometimes he would spell, as he styled it, the centinel on duty, by standing his tour, or relieving him (taking his place) until the said centinel could run and refresh himself, or do some little jobs of his own. This, however, was kept concealed from the officers, as it was against orders; but the soldiers all knew Driscol, and would as soon trust him as one of their own party. William Driscol returned from the army with Col. Bergher, in whose regiment, as has been mentioned, he held a subaltern office; he loved his Colonel, from whom he had received many favours, and was ever ready, on a just occasion, to sacrifice even his life, should that be necessary, in preservation of Bergher's. When, therefore, he and his father understood the cause of the Colonel's imprisonment, and especially when they discovered that his wife was under their protection, they determined to attempt his rescue: for this purpose they resorted to an inn near the prison, where they found Bergher's man who still remained there with the chaise, hoping to prevail on the officers to let him see his master: him they ordered to repair with the carriage to a certain place, there to await their farther directions. William was then stationed within call, and Driscol approached the centinel at the gate, who he knew kept the keys of the prison, and accosted him with—“Long life to the mighty Emperor, and merry days to his valliant soldiers!” “Hah, old warrior! is it you?” exclaimed the centinel. “What yet remains of me,” replied Driscol, “though pretty much withered and worn.” “Thou hast seen hard service, my veteran,” returned the soldier; “what remains of thee are still the parts of a hero.” “I have heard some popping, and seen some slashing,” rejoined Driscol; “but how goes the night, comrade?” “Dark and heavily,” he answered, “here have I been beating about these three hours, famished with hunger, parched with thirst, and no relief for an hour to come.” “How long since the visiting officers departed?” “Ten minutes, perhaps; not more.” “Then hand me thy slicer and blunderbuss,” said Driscol, “and run thee to thy hut, take a little rations, and return quickly, for I am in haste.” “Blessings on thee,” replied the soldier, delivering his sword and fusee; “thou shalt be Chief-Sutler when I am General. “Leave me thy unbolters,” returned Driscol, as the other was departing, “for should the visitors come, I must slouch my hat over my eyes, you know, and deliver them in silence.” “Ay, ay; true enough,” replied the centinel, turning and handing the keys; “well thought of: but unless I am ambuscaded, I shall be with you before you can go through the exercise.” He then posted away. Soon as he was gone, Driscol whistled, (the sign agreed on,) and William appeared, took the keys, and with a dark lantern they had brought with them, entered the prison and liberated Bergher as has been related. The soldier returned, thanked Driscol for the service rendered, and resumed his station. The circumstances could not be known farther, so that Driscol would never be called in question, and probably never suspected. Nor would the guards be punished or held responsible for an escape, unless they were proved negligent, or accomplices. Of these transactions Bergher was informed by the Driscols, on their return from the prison to the cottage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">N CHAPTER V. What God pursues us with immortal hate? What crimes provoke, and prompt the wrath of fate? What ceaseless rage hath dash'd our joys again, Pair'd in sad woes, and doom'd to endless pain?— Fly hence, ye shades! Let brighter scenes arise! Ease, peace and comfort, open on my view! Ye sorrowing hours, and agonizing sighs, Ye streaming tears, and fond complaints, adieu? Trumbull. Considering ourselves now beyond the reach of pursuit, we remained at the little town where we had halted, for several days; there we repaired our wardrobe and the loss of my trunk; we purchased such other articles as were necessary, and then re-commenced our journey. New and interesting to me were the various prospects which presented as we passed through different countries. Cities bustling with their busy throngs; hamlets scattered with cottages; almost boundless champaigns, spotted with dearth and verdure; immeasurable forests, echoing to the nightly roar of savage beasts, prowling for prey; mighty rivers, thundering to the distant ocean; lakes of sea-like magnitude; stupendous mountains crowned with unmelting snows, and based in luxuriant vegetation, their majestic summits towering into the sky, and frowning over the warring atmospheric tempests which convulsed the world below; magnificent ruins, and yawning chasms, the ravages of time, forgotten wars, or of ancient earthquakes; and sometimes, at immense distance, rose the volcanic eruption, flashing tremendous through the long vista of night. One day, as evening was setting in, we approached a wide desert, through which the road lay, bordered by towering hills and lofty precipices. We hesitated whether to pass such a dreary region at so late an hour. While we were considering how to act, a woodman with an axe upon his shoulder, emerged from the forest; we inquired of him its extent; “Six miles,” said he, “will bring you to a good house of entertainment.” Recollecting the last house we had passed to be twelve or fifteen miles distant, and as we should have moonlight for two or three hours, we proceeded on. The wilderness thickened as we advanced, its deep gloom transiently enlightened by the faint intercepted beams of a waxing moon. Silence was only interrupted by the plaintive breezes as they moaned among the branches, the sound of a torrent rushing down some remote declivity, except, at intervals, by the distant barking of a fox, or the long, wild, terrific howl of the mountain-wolf. We began to grow uneasy; instead of six, we had travelled, as we judged, more than twelve miles since we met the peasant at the entrance of the wood, and yet no house of entertainment, nor indeed any other house appeared; on the contrary, the sullen umbrageousness of the forest seemed to increase at every step. Our anxiety augmented when Bergher's repeater noted the hour of midnight, and still no prospect of emerging from the desert, though we must have advanced therein upwards of twenty miles. We at length descended into a deep valley; the moon had sunk behind the hills, and left us in thick darkness. Suddenly the horses stopped; Bergher urged them forward, but they refusing to proceed, he gave me the reins, sprang out, and advancing towards them saw a person holding them by the bridles; at the same instant he was seized by three stout fellows and hurried back to the carriage. I uttered an involuntary shriek, bereaved of my usual presence of mind by the suddenness of the incident. “Villains!” exclaimed Bergher, “release me immediately,” scarcely knowing what he said. “Not yet,” replied one of them; “get thee silently into thy vehicle, and take care of thy mate; but first reach us thy whinyard and popguns, if thou hast any; thou wilt now have no further use for them, as we shall take the trouble of guarding and defending thee.” “Who has a right?”—demanded Bergher: “by whose orders?”—while they secured his sword. “No speechifying,” interrupted the same voice; “thou shalt know all in good time; at present be silent and obey. Thou seest N 2 that resistance would be vain, and complaint useless; so climb thy cage and deliver thy plumpers speedily, or thy tenement and appertenances must undergo a search, which might not be altogether agreeable.” By this time we were surrounded by horse-men. Bergher reseated himself in the carriage and yielded his pistols; the fellow who had been speaking entered also; “Please to submit to a trifling operation,” said he, placing masks upon our faces, which totally obstructed our sight; after which, taking the reins and whip, “I will do myself the honour of being your postillion,” he continued; “but mark me, if you make the least noise, or speak a single word, I shall be under the necessity of decently boring you through.” He then took his seat, the carriage was turned about and driven back upon the way we came, at a rapid pace, with the guards around us, as we could perceive by the trampling of their horses. Conversant as I had been with difficulties, dangers and disappointments, this last event depressed my spirits beyond the prospect of hope. The first thought that struck me, was that we were in the power of banditti; but had that been the ease they would have been content with rifling, or at most with murdering us. On reflection, it was evident to my mind that our pursuers had discovered and passed us while we rested at the little town, had waylaid and surprised us, and that we were now on our return to Vienna. To be thus arrested, when we considered ourselves safe, was doubly distressing. My soul sickened at the idea, while in anticipation I already experienced the contempt, the scoffs, and sneers of my acquaintance; the triumphant taunts of my stepmother, the wrath and fury of my father, and the imprisonment and execution of my husband, who now supported me in his arms, as my heart palpitated with terror and despair. Not a word was spoken; all moved on with speed and in silence. At length the carriage appeared to be rolling over uneven grounds, and we could sometimes hear the branches of trees sweeping against it. Finally it halted, and orders were given to alight; we obeyed, and were led down a flight of steps, and through what we judged to be a long winding passage, till we were stopped by some obstruction which we supposed to be a door. We soon heard the tinkling of a bell, caused probably by some one of our conductors pulling a wire; persons apparently from within shortly removed whatever impeded our progress, and we passed on; our masks were then withdrawn, when we found ourselves in a spacious apartment illuminated by a number of glass lamps, and decorated with furniture of various description. There were about twenty persons in the room, all dressed in full uniform, with side arms. Others of the same description were constantly entering. We were invited, or rather ordered to take seats. Within a few minutes a person entered dressed in scarlet deeply laced with gold. All heads were instantly uncovered, which evinced him to be the chief. His appearance was stately, his aspect naturally pleasing, but artificially or habitually assuming fierceness; his eye piercing and commanding. He bowed to us politely, then continued to walk the room with a grand and measured step. His age we judged to be about forty. He only was unarmed of the party. We shortly saw our trunks brought in by two of the gang; one, who seemed to have a subordinate command, stepped up to us and demanded the keys; these trunks contained all our wealth, our money and my casket of jewels; the keys were yielded, conscious that remonstrance could be of no use. After examining the trunks, “A booty by the great Nimrod!” he exclaimed, locking them and presenting the keys to the chieftain, who without speaking or altering his course, deposited them in his pocket. The table was immediately spread, covered with the most costly plate and the richest dainties. We were urged to partake; Bergher whispered me to comply, so we took our stations among them; but I tasted of nothing. Little was said during the repast; once or twice some of them began to be boisterous, but a nod from their leader instantly silenced them. Soon as the cloth was removed, fruit and wine were placed upon the table; pouring out a full glass, their chief drank, “Health to the order of the mighty Nimrod!” They all rose upon their feet, “And to our valiant commander!” they cried with united voice, filling and tossing off their glasses. Reseating themselves they then drank as they pleased, conversing separately with each other in low voices. The chief offered us each a glass, saying to Bergher, as he presented them, “You are travellers, I presume, Sir.” “We were travellers, Sir,” returned Bergher. “True, Sir, true,” rejoined the other, smiling; “you now consider yourselves my prisoners, I suppose.” “I know not what opinion to form.” “Then believe yourself in the power of an honourable man.” “The event will determine that point,” replied Bergher. “Well, well,” said the chief, speaking quick, “time is lost by parley. You know me not; you know not where you are: who you are I care not. We must use despatch; but before we proceed to business I will give you a slight sketch of my character. Such is my custom when people of distinction fall into my hands, and as you appear to be of that class, you will hear me attentively. This I do, not in extenuation of what by some may be esteemed crime, but in justification, ample justification (raising his voice) of my own conduct. “Know then, Sir, that I am a general, a king, a commander in chief. Part of my life-guard only have you seen. My troops are scattered in various kingdoms; they are stationed in the Tyrol, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Appenines; they traverse the forests of Germany, Italy and France. I have proclaimed war against the world for the very defensible reason that the world first proclaimed war against me: I fight, as every other creature will do, for my own preservation. “Born to a princely fortune, I was flattered with princely expectations; the son of a nobleman, nearly allied to a crowned head.# My entrance upon life was brilliant; splendid were my prospects. The fields of fame, wealth and power, all that ambition could wish were open before me. Beauty, too, yes, beauty and the graces were approaching, to soften and to crown my weightier joys— Boy, bring more wine!” he exclaimed, pouring out and turning off a large goblet. “No imprudence of mine,” he continued, “defeated my high-wrought anticipations; the bloody quarrels of petty, avaricious tyrants; the ravages of civil commotion, destroyed them. [4] [4] About the year 1760 much havoc and devastation were committed by feudal dissentions, in the lesser states of Italy. The then Duke of Milan was a Piedmontese, and a relative of the king of Sardinia; he had a son who, on account of some disappointments, retired to the mountains, and became the leader of a band of robbers. He was finally reclaimed. My family were butchered, their wealth, their property seized, confiscated, and I reduced to beggary. My lovely, tender, sentimental friend, my solemnly affianced bride, torn from my expecting embrace, violated, and buried in a cloister. Glory, domination, dignity, possessions, annihilated in a moment. The blandishments of delight, the ecstacies of love, just within the fond pressure of my arms, ravished, snatched from me for ever. Deserted by my friends, those I had elevated to station and endowed with riches now shunned me as they would an aspic. In circles where adoration had been rendered me, I was now received with the upraised finger of scorn, or the cool, collected, sneer of contempt.—Wine, ho! bring more wine,” he cried, furiously stamping, while lightnings flashed from his eyes. “I know what the moralist would say on the occasion,” he proceeded, after a short pause; “for I was educated in the strictest principles of morality; he would preach patience, forbearance, honesty and virtue; but under the then agitations and convulsions of my mind, he might as well have preached them to the hurricane. The world could not restore what it had taken from me; still the world owed me a support. From me, retributitive justice was due to my despoilers; I took a dreadful one! I attached to my side a few Piedmontese, my native countrymen, who had suffered in the same cause with me; they were, therefore, friendless and poor, but bold and determined: in one night we butchered O those who had butchered our friends. We fled to the mountains, swore fealty to each other, and instituted ourselves a fraternity of foresters, entitled The order of Nimrod—Nimrod, you know, was a mighty forester and the first of our sect—I was instated in the office of commander. Thousands flocked to our standard, first of our own countrymen, then of the surrounding states. Every war, every political tumult, increases our force. From the tyrant's sceptre, the debtor's pursuit, from disappointment and adversity, disgusted with the world, men fly to my banners; by the troubled and conflicting state of nations have I been particularly successful in this respect, as we migrated from state to state, and from kingdom to kingdom. Mountainous countries and spacious forests are our favourite resorts. We are now in a cave of the mountain you must have seen on your right; tomorrow night we may be fifty miles distant. Our retreats are so constructed as to defy search; our spies are out in every quarter; the peasant you met on the verge of the forest was one; to induce you to proceed he deceived you; no sooner had you passed than a horseman, concealed near, was des patched to me. So you see we were prepared. [5] [5] This daring and powerful banditti were very troublesome in parts of Italy, Germany, and France, for more than half a century. They existed under different leaders until after the French revolution, and were finally dispersed and annibilated by the troops of Bonaparte. The following article is taken from a French provincial paper of May, 1804. “Thus have I given you an abstract of my history; and what think you of it? Injustice! you will exclaim: yet are not the measures I pursue more intrinsically, more radically just, than those adopted by the world? Lay aside prejudice; lay aside the sinister, or what you would style popular, definitions of your jurisprudence, and juridical decisions, and judge. I levy my tax on the rich only; you indiscriminately on rich and poor. I fight for existence; you for honour, profit, or fame. You esteem me a robber; the miser who exacts usury, the dealer who demands exorbitant profits, the sharper who swindles you of your cash, the creditor who under sanction of legal process seizes your property, beggars your family, and deprives you of liberty, are they not all robbers of a more contemptible grade? Your laws demand my life; they escape with impunity. “In one point there is a similarity between your monarchs and me: like them I make my demands, and like them I enforce those demands when resisted; like them I have my battles, but unlike them I wish to prevent a useless waste of blood, as you have experienced. No one, unresisting, ever perished by our hands. My orders are, not to attack, unless attacked. Surprise is my mode. Our prisoners are treated well and soon liberated. We fear not discovery; such are our arrangements that on signal we can disperse and secrete ourselves in perfect security, yet the sound of a horn will suddenly call thousands to my side. To day we may be seen in force within this forest; tomorrow not a remaining trace or vestige of us can be perceived. Parties have frequently been sent in quest of us; sometimes we vanish to O 2 our fastnesses; sometimes we meet, and vanquish them. We neither sack, like your robbers, nor conflagrate towns and villages; and when we lay them under contribution we readily compound for the money they can raise. “And what say you to my system? You are silent. But you probably think I am wasting your time and my own. Well: I will then dismiss the subject; and now I will show you my magnanimity; magnanimity which you rarely experience in dealings with your fellow-men. If by superior adroitness they overreach you, they will not relinquish the advantage for your benefit. I have told you I am at war with the world, and have briefly explained the equity of my cause; you are therefore my adversary, because you are a subject of the power with whom I am in hostility. You are my prisoner; your property, your life, are at my disposal: still will I extend the hand of clemency.” He then stepped to the trunks, unlocked them, took out the money and spread it upon the table. “Now observe my lenity and munificence,” he resumed; “besides myself, seventeen of my people were concerned in your capture; yourself and lady make twenty. The money shall be equally divided; you shall have one tenth part, the remainder is for me and my companions.” He then carefully counted the money into ten equal parts; after which, taking the casket of jewels in his hand, “by the laws of war,” he continued, “this valuable treasure belongs wholly to me, but as a compliment to the lady I present it to her. Your other articles you will find safe; your carriage, your horses, your weapons, shall be restored; you will be suitably attended to the place where we found you, and left to pursue your own course. Go thou then back to the world, see if it will treat thee better. Complain that thou hast been captured, say plundered, if it please thee, by the common enemy. Demand, as thou hast a right to, compensation for thy losses. If after all thou shouldst find, as I have done, nothing but selfishness and ingratitude in thy future connexions with man; if, sick of thy wonted society, thou shouldst wish to retire from it, return to me, enter my service, and thou shalt receive the reward thy merits may claim.” He then took one part of the money and the casket, deposited them in the trunks and presented to us the keys. Immediately the masks were replaced on our faces, we were led out, seated in the chaise, escorted to the place where we had been stopped, and the masks taken off. One of the gang restored Bergher his arms; the escort galloped away and we resumed our route. “Of what strange and singular materials,” said Bergher, “is man compounded! In the glowing vigour of youth he adventures on life, his passions edged by the keenest ardour, his soul strung to daring enterprize. Boundless is the field of his contemplated achievements; illimitable the sphere of his anticipated exertions. But he reflects not on consequences; he calculates not on disappointment, which, as death, is certain. He drinks deeply of the bitter cup, and like the infant from physic turns with aversion from the offensive yet salutary potion. Hence the enthusiast, the anchorite, the misanthrope, and the marauder. The character of the man in whose power we have been, is an heterogeneous compound of right and wrong, honour and dishonesty, candour and hypocrisy. In society he was injured by villains, and to obtain vengeance became a villain himself; to chastise the vices of a few he would inflict punishment on all. The compunctions of early moral instruction discompose him at times and then he endeavours to palliate his crimes by sophistry his conscience can never credit. He may with propriety be styled a rational maniac.” Though the loss of our property was severely felt, yet so different was the result of this adventure from our apprehensions, that we bowed to an overruling Providence in humble gratitude for our deliverance. Even when we found ourselves among robbers we experienced a mitigation of our fears; it was preferable to being conducted prisoners to Vienna. But when our lives were preserved, and our liberties restored, as also my casket and a small portion of our treasure, our loss, on the general scale of events, was at first but of minor consideration. Day was appearing when we cleared the forest. With mingled sensations of terror and joy, I looked back upon the savage prospect, where cliffs rose above cliffs, awful in dreary splendour. From the dark bosom of the desert, aspiring exhalations exhibited the rays of an early sun in a thousand varying hues. We continued our course, and without farther disastrous accident arrived at Paris. We took a house in a remote though populous part of the city, furnished it decently, and hired a man and woman servant. To accomplish this I was obliged to part with some of my jewels, as the little money the robbers had left us was soon expended. I understood the French nearly as well as the German language; the English I had studied as a science; Bergher was master of all three, the latter being his national tongue. We consulted which of these characters it was best to assume, and finally agreed upon the French. Bergher was therefore known to the servants by the name of Mons. Bourgonville. We determined to mingle as little in company as possible, and for a season to make few acquaintance; conscious however that the open manners and free urbanity of the French would not long permit us to remain entirely secluded. We had not long been settled when one morning an officer of police was announced, who being admitted, thus addressed himself: “You will not think me officious, Monsieur, when I inform you that our duty compels us annually to visit each family in this great city and report our investigation. Will you do me the honour to give me your name?” “Bourgonville, Monsieur,” answered Bergher. “But recently arrived in Paris, I presume?” “Recently.” “From whence, may I inquire?” “From the frontiers.” “I shall be proud of your acquaintance, Monsieur Bourgonville,” said the officer; “I will do myself the honour of sending you my card of address.” He then politely withdrew. This visit appeared singular; it might however be a custom in Paris; still it gave us some anxiety; but we were not long left in suspense. The same day just in the dusk of the evening Bergher's man who had been out returned and gave him a letter which he said was handed to him by a person in the street, with orders to deliver it immediately to his master. It was directed “To Mons. Bourgonville.” Supposing it must have come from the police officer, he broke the seal and read as follows: “Your retreat is discovered: fly instantly or you are lost. Within two hours your house will be surrounded, when there will be no possibility of escape. You are advertised in most of the papers on the continent. England may perhaps be a safe retreat. I have only a moment, and that obtained with difficulty, to apprize you of your danger. Fly—linger not, or it will be too late. “WILLIAM DRISCOL.” Judge of our terror and surprise on reading this note! No time was admitted for reflection or hesitation. We called our servants, told them we were going out and should not return before eleven o'clock. We then tied up a change of clothes in handkerchiefs, took the money and jewels we had left and departed a back way. Entering a narrow street, we perceived several armed men advancing towards us; we stepped into an alley, they passed us and turned towards the house; we doubted not but these were some of the party, destined to arrest us, now proceeding to their stations. The mail-coach for Calais we knew departed at eight o'clock that evening, which hour had nearly arrived. We repaired to the stage-house, took seats in the coach, and were soon rapidly receding from the capital of France. When we reached Calais the packet-boat for Dover was about to sail; we took passage therein, entered on board, and were shortly on our way to England. The wind was high and the sea rough; but the bellowing of the waves, the roaring of the gale, and the tumultuous clamours of the seamen, were music to my oppressed soul, because they evinced that we were now beyond the reach of our persecutors. P The scene to me was new, as I had never before been at sea. The rolling and tumbling of the vessel made me excessively sick. A terrible tempest tossed us about through the night, but in the morning we landed at Dover without accident; from thence we journeyed to London, determining to bury ourselves beyond the reach of scrutiny in that populous city. We took a furnished room on a second floor, in a by-street, and hired a servant. The remainder of my jewels were turned into money for present support or future emergency. Economy was now our object, consequently it became necessary that to preserve our limited funds business must be sought. In pursuit of this object Bergher applied to a counting-house for a clerkship, which he obtained at a weekly stipend. I undertook to teach a few young misses drawing and embroidery. By diligent attention we thus obtained ample means for our subsistence, without diminishing our slender funds. Bergher now took his original family name of Barker. Once more we were beginning to experience, as we thought, an exemption from present danger, and to enjoy common happiness and contentment; when one evening as Bergher was returning home from the duties of his office, he saw a number of bills posted up at the corners of streets and the public squares. The agitations of his mind could be but feebly portrayed when stepping up to one of them he found the following to be its contents: “1000 Guineas Reward, “Will be given for the apprehension of HERMAN BERGHER, late a colonel in the Austrian service. From Vienna he was traced to Paris, whence it is supposed he escaped to England. Information will be received by the Austrian Ambassador. Orders are issued by this government that foreigners and strangers of every description send their names and places of residence to their respective legations within ten days.” The advertisement concluded with a very accurate description of the person of Bergher. Paralyzed for the moment by this sudden and unexpected incident, we were at a loss how to act. It was evident we were no longer safe in England, probably not in Europe. Ere the next sun arose, possibly before one hour elapsed, we might be seized by the agents of our adversaries. Bergher, skilful in expedient and prompt in decision, proposed our embarking for some distant country by the first opportunity. The plan was no sooner adopted than he went out, traversed the quays, and found a ship which was to sail for America the succeeding day. Once more, therefore, we prepared to follow our adverse fortunes; took passage, entered on board, and by a short and pleasant voyage arrived at Boston. Our first consideration was to what we should turn our attention. Our money was principally wasted, and unless we could devise some means to increase, or at least not to draw upon our little remaining stock, it would soon be all exhausted. We believed ourselves now so far removed from the knowledge of all former acquaintance as to be completely out of the reach of danger from that quarter. Finally we hired a small house and shop in one of the streets recommended for the purpose, and commenced the business of purchasing and retailing goods. But totally unacquainted with trade and the habits of the people, we obtained little custom. And whether owing to the violent exertions of body and keen distress of mind we had experienced, to change of climate, or to other causes, we both soon fell sick, first Bergher and then myself: our business was consequently suspended, and when we recovered, after long and dangerous illness, the bills of physicians and attendants, with a portion of our rents which had become due, swept away what little we had remaining; to add to the dreariness of our situation, an uncommonly severe winter was then setting in, with all its connected horrors. Now for the first time did we experience, and bitterly too, the worth and the want of property. The sums which in better days we had squandered in trifles; the pittance we had bestowed on mendicants; nay even the fragments of my father's table, that which the servants cast daily to the dogs, could they have been permanently secured to us, we should have esteemed competency if not affluence. P 2 Still, strange as it may seem, we were not unhappy. I had a few valuable trinkets yet left, which were the gift of my honoured mother; with these I parted. Bergher also sold his gold repeating watch, a pair of diamond shoe and knee-buckles, and a set of gold buttons which he cut from a dress-coat, replacing them with others of little value. From these we raised money sufficient to sustain us through the winter. Of all the rich jewels my casket contained when I left Vienna, I retained only a ring given me by my mother on her death-bed, and this I hope not to part with while I have life. Spring with its reanimating influences arrived at last, and the harbour of Boston was soon crowded with merchant-ships from different parts of the world. We contemplated removing to some less expensive quarter of the town, and to set up an inn or common boarding-house. We had been one day to examine a tenement which was offered us for that purpose, when passing near the port on our return, we lingered to observe the passengers landing from a large ship which had, just arrived. Among those who came on shore our attention was fixed by one whose dress and appearance evinced him to be of superior rank. He was attended by servants in livery, to whom he seemed giving some directions; then turning, walked along the street towards us. Approaching near, he suddenly stopped and gazed at us with apparent surprise. The astonishment was mutual; in the stranger we immediately discovered the brother of Count Hubert, he whom the Count had selected as his second in the contemplated interview with my brother, as previously mentioned. Instantly we hurried from the spot; he followed us slowly; we turned into the first alley that presented and lost sight of him. We doubted not that he had come commissioned and properly attended to arrest us. That on seeing, he recognized us, his conduct clearly evinced. Knowing therefore we were in the town, his search would be scrutinizing and persevering; consequently we could not long remain undiscovered. Bergher, since his arrival in this country, had reassumed his proper name, and though his acquaintance in town were few, yet in the street where we resided he was known by the name of Bergher. Little time was admitted for deliberation. We must leave the place; but whither should we go? What unknown part of the world could conceal us? Would misfortune and calamity never cease to afflict us, the evil genius of adversity to haunt our steps? Were our adversaries endowed with supernatural powers? Could we evade their pursuit only in the grave? Again must we fly from impending danger, adventure on untried scenes, desolate, friendless and poor, without even object or aim except escape from implacable and perilous destiny. The period for which we hired the premises we occupied had nearly expired. Mr. Hammond, our landlord, was an auctioneer; to him Bergher offered the sale of our household furniture, which he agreed to purchase. We reserved only a few articles. From the avails, after deducting the rent due, he supplied us with a small, light, single waggon and a horse; the trifling balance remaining he paid us in cash. Into this waggon we flung a bed and a few utensils for cooking, then, with an infant in my arms, we seated ourselves therein and took our leave of Boston in the dusk of the evening, journeying westward. We travelled for several days, stopping only for rest and refreshment. At a tavern on the road we overtook a family removing, as they said, into the new countries. This family consisted of six persons, the parents and four children; the man's name was Millard. He had purchased a large tract of wild, but excellent land, part of which he had cleared, sowed several acres with wheat, built a log house and barn, and was now going to settle thereon. “Perhaps,” said Millard to Bergher, “you are a new settler also;” and our appearance would well warrant the conjecture; “perhaps you are new settlers: If so, and you have not already made a purchase, I know of no better part of the country than that to which I am bound. Wild lands may there be bought for half a dollar an acre, and a long credit obtained for most part of the purchase money. All you have to do is to clear a few acres, build a log hut, get in a crop of wheat, and if you can subsist the first year you soon begin to thrive, and with prudence cannot fail in time to become rich. Every surplus bushel of wheat will purchase an acre of land or its equivalent; by this means you increase or stock your farm, or pay labourers for clearing and improving it. Soon by diligence and attention your own possessions furnish you with all the necessaries of life, some of its superfluities, and the means of obtaining others; and besides, your lands are every year rising in value. The new country is the poor man's Canaan; to him it is a land flowing with milk and honey. He there finds not only a plentiful supply for himself, but independence and affluence for his children. The forest affords abundant provender for his cattle, and in no small degree comforts for his family; it abounds with a variety of fruits, nuts, herbs and roots, some of which possess in an eminent degree a nutricious, others a medicinal quality; acorns which fall from the oak in autumn completely fatten his swine, and they require no other feeding; then the maple is in itself a treasure; from its trunk you extract a liquid which by various process is transformed into spirituous or fermented liquor, vinegar, molasses, and the richest of sugars. The birch tree affords a similar fluid, though much inferior in quality.[6] [6] The author has seen beer and vinegar of an excellent quality made from the sap of the birch. In clearing the land we obtain materials for building, firewood for the winter, and even the ashes produced by burning the useless wood and timber on the grounds, are valuable for the potash-works. The earth being fertile needs little tillage and yields copiously. Indeed, the man whose industry would scarcely procure him bread in a cultivated country, soon acquires opulence in a new settlement.” Millard's glowing though plain description of the new countries, induced Bergher to follow his advice. With him therefore we travelled till we came to this place, which ended our journey. It was then indeed a new country; a few log cottages with a cleared field to each, were the only marks of improvement; all the rest was wilderness for many miles around. We took up our abode with Millard for a few days, who was agent for the land-holders in these parts; of him Bergher purchased a lot of one hundred acres of wild land. The neighbouring farmers assisted in erecting a log hut, into which we removed the third week after our arrival. Our first object was to clear a spot for a garden, then a few acres for wheat. In this also the neighbours generously lent their aid.[7] [7] It is customary in new countries for the settlers to convene for many miles around and alternately assist each other in clearing a lot of land, erecting a log but, &amp;c. The additional purchase of a single cow, a team, farming utensils, necessary furniture, and other indispensible articles, completely exhausted our remaining funds, so that for the ensuing year our crop of wheat was our sole dependence; this proving bounteous, enabled us merely to subsist, but for some years we could do little more. We were compelled to observe a course of the strictest prudence and of the most arduous industry. The necessaries of life are few compared with its superfluities; to the former we limited ourselves; nor were, even they, at times, obtainable, in proportion to our wants; frequently have we gone supperless to bed, that our children might partake of a scanty meal, consisting of wild fruits and milk, or sometimes, only of boiled or roasted potatoes. But our circumstances soon grew better; our garden supplied us with sauce; Indian corn, both in its green and ripe state, afforded a healthy and agreeable food, its meal excellent bread, which enabled us to dispose of our wheat at market. The rivers abounded with fish, the forests with game, which, at certain seasons of the year, plentifully furnished our tables. Vegetables of various kinds were collected from the spontaneous production of the fields. The trunks of hollow trees, where bees had taken up their residence, often gave us large quantities of honey. But the maple yielded us not only the delicacies of the Indies, but was also a source of real profit, as scarcely a year passed, but, from its sap, we manufactured a considerable surplus quantity of sugar, which always found a ready market at the adjacent towns.[8] [8] The sugar-maple of America is an article eminently entitled to the attention of every new settler; indeed, it may be asked whether its cultivation be not an object for legislative consideration and patronage; were liberal premiums offered, in proportion to the quantity and quality of sugar annually produced therefrom, it would probably go far to reduce the price and diminish the importation of that commodity, perhaps finally to exclude the use of foreign sugars, by which millions would be saved, yearly, to the states. At any rate, in case of war, or other event, by which our commerce might be expelled the ocean, it would secure to us the use of this delicacy, which habit has possibly rendered indispensible. As the tree is easily cultivated, farmers, by appropriating a portion of their grounds thereto, would readily supply themselves with sufficient quantities of sugar for family use. The tree, besides its saccharine properties, is valuable both for timber and firewood. Q Once in each winter we generally experienced the novel sight of Indians, from the different tribes in the west, passing through our settlement, with furs and peltry, to the seaport towns, for the purposes of trade: And sometimes strolling parties of them would take their residence and erect wigwams in our neighbourhood, till they could manufacture a number of splint brooms and baskets, which they exchanged with the inhabitants for provisions. Economy, prudence, and industry, so necessasy in commencing business with small capitals, can nowhere be practised to greater advantage than among the farmers of new countries. The clearing of wild lands is an arduous task, but the wood taken therefrom may with care be made to pay nearly the expense. That which will not answer for fencing and other timber, is turned into coal for the smiths, or reduced to ashes and manufactured into potash. Even the smallest faggots and brush-wood are thus of some consideration. But no small source of profit consists in what the farmers of this country call lumber, such as staves, shingles, boards, &amp;c. which are purchased by shippers at the seaports, from whence they are exported to the different countries of Europe, and to the Indies. It was at the time, Miss Bloomfield, when the experience of favours could not have been more appropriate, that we became acquainted with and were laid under obligations by your family. Your worthy grandfather was then a large holder of new and of some improved lands in these parts, which he rented to us on easy terms. He also assisted Bergher with money to purchase Millard's estate, who removed to another part of the country. After the death of your grandfather some of these lands devolved upon your aunt, who continued the rent to Bergher, and finally appointed him her agent and manager. The preceding narrative, which contains a brief sketch of the principal incidents hitherto attendant on a variegated life, I had at different times committed to paper, intending to preserve it for the use and instruction of my children after my decease. The arrival of my brother, whom I really supposed dead, enables me now to explain and elucidate some incidents connected with the foregoing relation, and thus to complete the history. “A famous brigand, called Saint Rochetto, has lately been arrested at Piedmont. He has been the chief and creator of 16 bands of barbarians, or robbers, in the Alps, of whom 306 have been executed. He never had any fixed house, but he knew perfectly well the Alps and all retreats in these mountains, and wherever he went he had the talents to form new bands and to inspire his fellows with the most violent hatred against the French, of whom he acknowledged to have killed with his own hands 120, and that his comrades, during the last year, have by ambuscades which he prepared, destroyed upwards of 1500 republicans. The jealousy of one of his mistresses delivered him up to St. Benigno. Memorials concerning many of his transactions were found upon him, and receipts from different priests and friars for 2,560,000 livres, which he had given to the churches and convents, to have masses and prayers said for obtaining the assistance of the Virgin Mary in his undertakings. He had, besides, a list upon him of thirty persons whom he intended to despatch this year, as soon as possible, among whom were two Buonapartes, Vice-President Melz, Generals Menou, Murat, St. Cyr, &amp;c. On his way to Turin he knocked out the brains of a gens d' armes with his handcuffs, and bit off the nose of another who attempted to tie his hands on his back. He is a very strong man and his body is covered over with hair, like a goat.” The arrestation and execution of this chief did not however disperse the gang. They raised up another leader who assumed the name and title of General Diable. Determining to avenge the death of Rochetto, he attacked different parties of the French, and often successfully, murdering all that fell into his hands. Gen. Devil was at length slain, fighting at the head of his band; the robbers were dispersed, driven to the mountains, and finally hunted down, individually and collectively. What few remained fled to distant countries. The method of preparing or manufacturing sugar from the maple, is as follows: in the months of February and March, when the weather is such as to freeze in the night and thaw in the day, when the vital juice of plants begins to circulate, and before the buds swell, the trees are tapped, by boring several holes diagonally into their trunks, about one fourth of an inch diameter, three or four inches deep, from eighteen to twenty inches apart, and from two to five feet from the root; tubes, composed of wood or hollow weeds are inserted in these holes, which serve to conduct the sap into troughs prepared to receive it; nothing more is necessary, but to strain and boil the sap to the consistence of sugar, taking off the scum as the liquor heats, before it boils, and carefully stirring it as it grows thick to prevent it from burning. Brass boilers or kettles make the best coloured sugar. The trees will bear tapping every other year, and frequently every year, if large and thrifty; they will yield from thirty to one hundred gallons of sap, each, in a season; every gallon of sap will make about four ounces of sugar. In the spring of 1808, a farmer in the back settlements of Massachusetts inserted twenty taps into one tree on his own farm, by means of which he extracted twenty-three gallons and three quarts of sap in one day, which produced seven pounds and four ounces of sugar. The whole quantity of sugar made from the same tree that season, was thirty-three pounds, which according to the above proportion, must have required upwards of one hundred and eight gallons of sap. The sap as drawn from the tree is an agreeable and cooling beverage; by a fermentative process it makes a very pleasant beer, which becoming stale produces vinegar; boiled to a certain consistence it is excellent molasses, which submitted to distillation, yields ardent spirits of a rich taste and fine flavour; and when manufactured with care, the sugar is inferior to none that we import, and will bear refining as well. The writer has seen Maple-Sugar which in texture, colour, and taste, was equal to any he had ever met with manufactured from the Cane. During the American revolution, molasses, spirits, and sugar, were made from the stalks of Indian corn, by a process similar to that adopted with the Cane.— Sugar has also been extracted from carrots, beets, and some other roots and vegetables, but much inferior in quality to that manufactured from the maple.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Q 2 CHAPTER VI. Restore, celestial powers, my youthful morn, Call back my years, and let my fame return; Give me to trace, beyond that pathless sea, Those joyous hours, from care's intrusions free. Enough; 'tis past; thy parting breath demands The last sad office from surviving hands. To share thy pains, and feel thy hapless woe, Are rites ungrateful to a fallen foe. Barlow. The wound which my brother received from Hubert in attempting my rescue, was serious; it passed through his body near the right breast; he fell, bereaved of sense and motion. The Count was also wounded in the head by the discharge of Du Ruyter's pistol, the ball glancing off without fracturing the bone; stunned for the moment, he likewise fell; a conflict then ensued between the servants of each party, when perceiving the Driscols approaching with lanterns, they fled; each bore their master to his respective chariot, and drove speedily away. By the time his people had conveyed him home, the Count revived; his first inquiry was for me. In the bustle and confusion I had not been thought of; no one could give any account of me. He ordered his men back to the place where the fracas happened; I was then at Driscol's cottage, of course they returned without making any discovery. Concluding that I had by some means effected my escape with Bergher, he sent his servants out to search in every quarter, and to scour every road leading from the metropolis; nor was it until the next morning, when Bergher appeared before him, that Hubert perceived his mistake. Throughout the day I was strictly sought in all parts of the city and its suburbs. It was but a few moments after Bergher had escaped from prison, when the visiting officers returned and found he was gone, but by what means could not be discovered; the alarm being immediately made, troops were despatched to all the passes, as has been related. The next day the centinel who was knocked down by Bergher, on attempting to stop us by seizing the horses' bridles, related the particulars of that event. But we could be traced no farther; nor could the informer identify the person from whom he received the stroke. The wound which Hubert received from Bergher was considered mortal; the latter was therefore advertised as a deserter and a murderer. The officer whom Bergher had disarmed on the road, and who was so much injured by the falling of his horse, languished for a considerable time before he recovered so as to give any correct detail of the recounter: but soon as he was able to tell his story, the route which we had taken was known, and without much difficulty traced, by intelligence gained from the peasant and his son, who conveyed the maimed officer to the village. The brother of Count Hubert with a body of soldiers instantly commenced the pursuit; William Driscol volunteered in the party, determining if possible to apprize Bergher of their designs before they could arrest him, should they discover his retreat; by inquiry and description they followed our track to Paris, but there they lost us. Application was made to the police, who granted orders for taking the names and qualifications of all strangers in the city; among others, the character of Mons. Bourgonville was considered suspicious; spies were set to watch the house, and Bergher was seen standing at the door by the brother of Hubert; of this the party were instantly notified, and arrangements made for securing us; but before this could be effected William Driscol found means to deliver the note to our servant, as previously stated. We had but just left the house when the soldiers, headed by the public officers, rushed in; the astonished servants, who informed them that we had been gone out but a few minutes and would soon be back, were secured. The party remained there until day-light, when it was conjectured that we had discovered the plot and escaped. Again search was made for us throughout the city and adjoining country for several days, and couriers despatched on all the roads, but no vestiges of our flight could be ascertained. Hubert's brother, with William Driscol and a few of his followers, then crossed over to England; this produced the notification from the Austrian minister, which Bergher discovered in season to secure his flight. The result of the investigation in England proving ineffectual, the pursuit was suspended, and the party returned to Vienna; the friends of Count Hubert contenting themselves with extending the advertisement for Bergher's apprehension through all the countries of Europe. The distress of my father can scarcely be imagined on seeing his son brought home wounded, as was supposed, mortally, and when on the following day he understood that Hubert had fallen in an encounter with Bergher, and suspecting also that I, who he found was missing, had absconded with him. It was indeed reported that both Du Ruyter and the Count were dead, which report was circulated by the friends of the latter, in order to stimulate the pursuit, and accelerate the apprehension of Bergher: on this rumour Driscol founded the story he related in my hearing at the cottage; nor was it known either to Bergher or myself but that the facts were true, until the late arrival of my brother. The Baron previous to his receiving positive information of my departure from Vienna, instituted a strict inquiry to discover the place of my retreat. A fever and delirium increased the alarming symptoms attending my brother's wound. Several days elapsed before he recovered the use of his reason; the first rational sentence he pronounced was to inquire for his sister; of all that was publicly known he was informed. Hubert's minions with his brother were then in pursuit of us. Du Ruyter instantly called my father to his bed-side.—“Selina,” said he, “is the wife of Bergher—proclaim this immediately and save the reputation of your house.” He then gave the Baron a circumstantial account of the transaction, who, tenaciously fond of family dignity, ordered our marriage to be announced in the public gazettes. The servant who had been dismissed by Bergher when he escaped from prison, appeared before the Baron and Du Ruyter to whom he related the events of that night. Old Driscol was sent for, who confirmed the story, and gave further information respecting the affair, still keeping the agency of himself and William out of view, of which the servant knew nothing material. My maid was still retained in the service of Lady Du Ruyter; in a severe fit of illness, approaching death aroused her to a consciousness of guilt; to my brother she made a voluntary confession. As we conjectured, she had been seduced to betray me by the advancement of large sums, and the promise of still greater rewards. The note which she pretended to have received from Du Ruyter's footman, was the contrivance of my step-mother and the forgery of Hubert, who designed to have taken me to his country-seat, and there to offer me the alternative of his hand or a public exposure of my intended elopement. Lady Du Ruyter was to manage the Baron respecting the affair, from whom the plan was kept secret. On the return of the party sent in pursuit of us, William Driscol related to Du Ruyter the particular incidents of their journey; how they had discovered and would have arrested us in Paris, had he not secretly apprized us of our danger; and of our sudden flight from that city, which was the last he had heard of us. When my brother's health was restored, understanding that the Count had also recovered, he gave him notice that as their contemplated meeting had been too long suspended by unforeseen events, it was indispensible that he should now name an early season for that purpose; Hubert returned a note in which this short sentence was only written—“You shall soon hear from me.” The succeeding day another note came from the Count equally laconic; “I am now ready to give you satisfaction;” it said, “meet me within half an hour at the Stranger's Hotel, north of the city.” Thither Du Ruyter repaired with his friend. As they entered the Hotel, Hubert's footman met them, with marks of deep dejection upon his countenance. “Where is your master?” demanded my brother. “He is in that room, dying,” said the man, pointing to a door. “Dying?” R “Yes, your honour, dying,” replied the servant, “and has directed me to conduct you to him.” They followed the man into the room, where they found the Count, pale, ghastly and bleeding, supported by his brother and a surgeon. He lifted his haggard eyes and fixing them upon Du Ruyter—“The business is accomplished without your agency,” he said in a faint, hollow voice, “as you must readily perceive; but at this moment your presence is necessary for important purposes, and therefore have I called you. Here are letters which I entrust to your care.” He then gave my brother three letters; one directed to himself, another to the Baron, the third was for the Emperor. “My request is,” he continued, “that you neither read your own nor present the others until tomorrow. And now, if I may be permitted to ask another favour, it is that you will give me your hand in token of forgiveness. I can say but little—my time is short even for that.” Du Ruyter instantly reached out his hand, which the dying man seized with convulsive grasp. “My faults have been many,” he resumed; “your family I have deeply injured —all I could do as atonement in the short space allotted me—I have executed. And now—adieu!” said he, as some of his friends entered the room with a clergyman, when my brother and his friend departed, and in a few hours they received the intelligence that Count Hubert had expired. The ensuing day Du Ruyter delivered the two letters as directed, and opened his own in which the Count had written the particulars of his conduct relative to Bergher and myself, and which in all points accorded with the dying confession of my maid. He also stated that his letter to the Emperor contained a solemn request that the proscriptions against Bergher should be recalled, he invited to return, and restored to his honours. That to the Baron was of similar import, earnestly enjoining him to reinstate his daughter completely in his favour. Within a few days an imperial edict was issued, declaring Col. Herman Bergher entirely innocent of and fully exculpated from all the crimes and misdemeanours which had been alledged against him, inviting and requesting him to return and take his post as general in the Austrian army, to which the Emperor had seen fit to advance him in consequence of his abilities and meritorious services. Hubert had fallen in a duel. Besides his engagement with my brother he had received two challenges; one from a gentleman whose sister he had dishonoured and abandoned to misery; the other from Col. Hembold, the officer selected by Du Ruyter as his friend in the proposed interview with the Count, as before stated; who, on hearing Hubert declaim against Bergher in public company, defended his character and attempted a justification of his conduct; high words ensued; they parted in anger, and the next morning the Count received a message. Both interviews were fixed for the same day, one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Hubert fell in the first, by the hand of the person whose sister he had so seriously injured. It was after these arrangements were made, and the day previous to the meeting, that he received Du Ruyter's note and thereto returned so short an answer. Probably his intentions then were, should he prove victorious in the first encounter, to fight all three in succession; but the sudden approach of death through the avenues of a mortal wound might have given him new views on the subject, or at least excited new apprehensions. Couriers were immediately despatched into all the different countries of Europe to discover our retreat and to call us home; as they passed through the great towns and cities they caused the Emperor's edict to be published in the principal gazettes, and in various languages, with the offer of large rewards to whoever could give information by which we might be found. One after another the messengers returned unsuccessful, to the great grief of my father and the deep disappointment of our friends. All Vienna became interested in our misfortune and sincerely lamented our fate. The Emperor was seriously afflicted and withdrew his favour from the family of Hubert. Du Ruyter determined to set out in search of us; the brother of the deceased Hubert asked leave to accompany him. They commenced their journey, each attended by a servant R 2 only. It was conjectured that on finding so hot a pursuit and such severe proscriptions instituted and enforced against us, we had fled to America, as emigrations to that country were frequent; they believed that if we were still in Europe, some gazette containing the notification respecting Bergher must fall into our hands, and that consequently we should return to Vienna. The travellers therefore pursued their way to Paris, and after a fruitless inquiry there, extended the investigation through all parts of Great Britain and Ireland with the same effect. They then agreed to part; Hubert sailed for America and Du Ruyter for the West Indies. Hubert arrived at Boston at the time he was recognized by Bergher and myself, and which caused our sudden flight into the country. He also saw us, and had as he believed discovered our retreat; but after the most inquisitive search in all the populous parts of the town without gaining the least intelligence respecting us, he concluded he must have been mistaken. He then pursued the inquiry to the city of New-York, where he was to await the arrival of my brother. The latter, after traversing the West-India Islands and some parts of the southern continent, sailed to Savannah in Georgia; thence prosecuting his journey northward he stopped at the different towns through which he passed, frequently making excursions to country villages, in hopes of obtaining some information relative to the object of his pursuit. He reached New-York, and with Hubert proceeded to Albany; they then crossed the country, taking Hartford in their way, to Boston. They had caused to be inserted in most of the American gazettes, the edict of the Emperor in the German, French and English languages, with a notice offering high rewards for information respecting us, and stating that Du Ruyter was in America, and might be found at a particular house in Boston, where he had left his address in case we should apply in his absence. Remote as we then were from all the sources and every channel of intelligence and information; seated in the midst of wilderness, surrounded by penury, impelled to hard labour for subsistence, and distant from any conspicuous town, no gazette found its way into our log-hut neighbourhood. Most of the peasants were too poor to pay for them; others too much engaged in daily avocations, and some too ignorant to read; indeed very few possessed the curiosity. As for ourselves, we were content to remain buried to the world, and felt a reluctance to know even what was passing therein, confident that we could learn nothing which would tend to increase our comfort or our happiness. Hence the imperial edict with the publications which accompanied it never reached us; and hence the most scrutinizing inquiries and investigations of our friends could never discover us. My brother was unwilling to relinquish the pursuit, especially after Hubert informed him of the glance he supposed he obtained of us in the streets of Boston; the idea still pressed upon his mind that Hubert was not mistaken in his conjecture; he of course frequently wandered about the town and its environs, and through Charlestown, examining into every inn, boarding-house, and all places of public resort. Entering an ale-house one day, he as usual inquired whether any stranger had resided in that street within a year past. The people appeared to have some imperfect remembrance of a person who had kept a shop and retailed goods there for a short time, and they referred him to the owner of the tenement, on whom he immediately called: this was Hammond the auctioneer. He informed Du Ruyter at what time he had rented to us certain premises, and when we left them; that we were poor and unfortunate; whether we were Americans or foreigners he could not tell, nor could he give any very accurate description of our persons. He did not even recollect our names: when my brother mentioned Bergher, he rather thought that was the name, but would not be positive; we had sold him what little furniture we possessed, and left town in a waggon; but whither we went he knew not; he had never heard of us thereafter. This was indeed all he knew of us. So imperfect was this intelligence that Du Ruyter doubted whether the persons thus described could be his friend and sister; still, as it was merely possible, he and his companion again made excursions through the country towns and villages, but could learn nothing farther respecting the subject of their anxiety. Trusting that if we were in America some of the gazettes containing the imperial edict with the note attached thereto must reach us, and that in consequence thereof we should, as the note directed, immediately repair to Boston, they remained in that town about a year, and then concluded to return home. But before they departed my brother had another interview with Hammond; “I have some reason,” said he, “to believe that the people who rented your tenements are those I have been seeking. If therefore you can possibly find them out, and will apprize a gentleman I shall name in this town of the circumstance, you shall be entitled to receive from him the reward of one thousand dollars, provided the persons discovered be the same I allude to and whom I have so long sought.” Hammond took down Bergher's name and engaged to make every effort in his power to find us, or the persons at least who had been his tenants. The gentleman whom Du Ruyter named as a reference, and with whom he had made the proper arrangements, was an eminent German merchant who had long resided in Boston. They then took their departure with only the solitary hope remaining that we were still in Europe, had received the intelligence of the change in our favour, and that they should experience the satisfaction of meeting us at Vienna. But how deep their disappointment on arriving at that city! We were now given up as lost. It was generally supposed that we had perished in crossing the seas to some distant country. Disconsolate and dejected, my brother entered into the Emperor's service, and renewed war soon called him abroad. He was absent except in short visits for some years. When on the cessation of hostilities he returned home, he found, to increase his affliction, that the extravagance and dissipatious conduct of Lady Du Ruyter had involved the Baron's estate beyond the possibility of redemption. By the advice of his son, my father commenced a retrenchment of his expenditures, but it was too late; the mortgages were so heavy and the creditors so pressing that his entire possessions were finally sold to satisfy the demands. His lady, thus checked in her dissolute career and no longer able to shine in public, withdrew in chagrin from the world, fell into a decline, and within one year thereafter was conveyed to the tomb. My father retired with his son to the Saxon estates of the latter; there he passed the remainder of his life in as much comfort and serenity as his troubles and the infirmities attending increasing years would admit, and died at an advanced age, when my brother succeeded to the title of Baron Du Ruyter. My sisters were prosperous and lived in splendour. Their families are of the first distinction in Germany. Du Ruyter made ample provision for the Driscol family. William followed the army, and in due time was advanced to the command of the regiment of Bergher. It is now about two years since a gentleman travelling to the westward arrived here during a heavy storm, and tarried with us a few days until the weather proved more favourable, and the roads passable, which were rendered unsafe by the flood. Finding he was from Boston, Bergher made some inquiries concerning Hammond the auctioneer; the stranger was well acquainted with him; he had become a merchant of some distinction. Bergher informed his guest that he had once for a short time rented tenements of this person. These observations passed in the course of general conversation, and were not by us called into remembrance after the traveller departed. Now it is known that when the gentleman returned to Boston, he casually informed Hammond of the circumstance and also of the place where we resided, who being struck by the name of Bergher, had recourse to his memorandum and found it to be the same my brother had mentioned. He then communicated the intelligence to the German merchant to whom Du Ruyter referred him, who wrote to the Austrian minister in England and he despatched a courier to my brother with the news. Du Ruyter instantly determined to visit us and made the necessary preparations for his departure. Having never married, his family consisted only of servants and attendants. He appointed the steward superintendant of affairs in his absence, arranged all other matters, apprized his friends of his intentions and set out for this country. Arriving at Boston he obtained the necessary directions S and reached us in due season. His first wishes were that we should return with him to Germany and reside with our friends; but finding we were so well established here, and perceiving our attachment to the country, he has relinquished that prospect, determining however to remain a length of time with us before he returns to the place of his nativity. You now, Miss Bloomfield, have the eventful story of my past life. You must perceive that I have experienced severe distress, encountered formidable calamities and suffered deep afflictions. Providence has at length kindly given me a haven of rest, and in great mercy crowned my latter days with comfort, serenity and peace. The restoration of my brother as from the tomb has freed my soul from a load of sorrows. His explication of events to us so important and hitherto involved in mystery, relieved our minds from a weight of cares. Our long tempest of troubles has ceased, and Heaven, more beneficent than our deserts, or even our expectations, has once more caused the sun of consolation to shine mildly upon our prospects. Here ended the interesting narrative of Mrs. Bergher. Melissa reflected solemnly on the subject. She perceived to what misfortunes an opposition to parental authority must lead, and also the dreadful effects of parental tyranny. Had the conduct of Mrs. Bergher been discrete? Was that of her father justifiable? Both, it appeared to her, had acted wrong; yet she could not clearly discover what course the former should have pursued; but she saw plainly the disastrous consequences of permitting the affections to triumph over reason, and she involuntarily though feelingly exclaimed, “O my God! preserve me from trials similar to these!” Before she returned the manuscript she transcribed it and intrusted its perusal to her parents, by which a singular fact was discovered: Barker, the father of Bergher, was an Englishman, as has been mentioned; he was the uncle of Melissa's mother, who descended from an English family of that name, the members of which were well acquainted with the circumstance of Barker's going over to Germany, but they knew nothing farther than that he married a lady of that country, and after her death entered the Austrian service, where he perished. They understood he had one son, who was also in the army, but had never heard of the alteration made in the name. The narrative elucidated these events. Barker abandoned England on account of being disappointed in receiving some promised advancement for certain eminent services rendered his country. After this the families of Bloomfield and Bergher recognized each other as relatives, and a more intimate intercourse existed between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Full on thy cheek the roses glow, Their fragrance floats upon thy breath; Fair on thy neck the lilies blow, And ah, they blow that neck beneath. Thy locks in wavy ringlets flow, To which a nameless grace is given, And shade thy swelling bosom's snow, Like clouds that veil a part of heaven. Stanley. Glenford, the relative with whom Melissa resided while a pupil at the New-London female academy, married his wife in Jersey. He with his lady, about this time, had been to visit her parents, and on their return passed a few days at the seat of Col. Bloomfield. While there, Mrs. Glenford insisted, and it was agreed, that Melissa should accompany them home and tarry a short time, when Edgar was to go there and attend her back. In the absence of his sister young Bloomfield received a visit from a gentleman who had been his class-student at Yale; his name S 2 was Alonzo Haventon, the only child of an eminent merchant who resided in an adjacent seaport town; he was designed for the bar and soon expected to enter upon his professional studies. It was a joyful meeting between him and Edgar, for at College they had formed a permanent and indissoluble friendship. Alonzo was about twenty-one years old; of elegant and stately appearance, polished manners, and highly prepossessing address; his eye indicated sublimity of mind, honourable sentiment, and a soul of exquisite sensibility; his settled countenance seemed tinged with shades of melancholy, but when animated by interesting company, or sprightly conversation, he was cheerful and often gay; young, ardent and enterprizing, he looked forward to his profession as the principal road to dignity and emolument; without arrogance, he was not destitute of laudable ambition; and though he aspired to shine in the sphere he had selected, “Yet far beyond the pride and pomp of power, He lov'd the realms of nature to explore; With lingering gaze Edenian spring survey'd; Morn's fairy splendours; night's gay curtain'd shade; The high hoar cliff; the grove's benighting gloom; The wild-rose widow'd o'er the mouldering tomb; The heaven-embosom'd sun; the rainbow's die, Where lucid forms disport to fancy's eye.” The vernal flowers; mild autumn's purpling glow; The summer's thunder and the winter's snow. His genius was far superior to the ordinary class, which had been cultivated and expanded by the refinements of an excellent education. While Alonzo continued his visit the season approached when Edgar was to proceed to New-London and escort his sister home; he invited his friend to accompany him, who readily accepted the invitation; when the time arrived they set out together, and at evening on the second day of their journey reached the place and repaired to the house of Glenford. Melissa was at a ball, given in celebration of a marriage in that town; she did not return until late; Bowman, her gallant, as mentioned in the early part of this work, attended her; she flew into the arms of Edgar; as he introduced Haventon she started and seemed confused; Alonzo also appeared surprised; Bloomfield perceived their embarrassment, but could not conjecture the cause; he endeavoured to relieve them by presenting Bowman to his friend; they were both also apparently astonished and performed the ceremony in evident discomposure. Bloomfield contemplated this double scene of emotion with excited curiosity and anxiety: after Bowman retired he made some inquiries of his sister, and she informed him that Haventon was the stranger who by risking his own safety had rescued her from such imminent danger when on the point of being plunged down a tremendous precipice, as has been related; “And he,” said Edgar, “was my most intimate friend at College. An explanation now took place; Alonzo received the renewed acknowledgements of Edgar and his sister for the important service he had rendered them. He told them that when the incident occurred he had been on a visit to a distant relative of his father whose name was Vincent. This person resided in the neighbourhood of Col. Bloomfield, and was well known to the family. If Alonzo was interested by the appearance of Melissa when he first saw her agitated by affright, trembling, shuddering with the apprehensions of sudden death; if then; after snatching her from perils so hazardous, he became fixed to the spot she had left, gazing stedfastly after the carriage as it conveyed her away, his feelings were not less affected on this second interview, when he beheld her calm, placid, smiling and cheerful; on his mind she impressed those ideas of that perfection which a poet of later days thus happily expresses: “Not Nature's hand her beauty could improve; Her voice was melody; her mind was love; Her manners graceful; air, intrancing ease; Her skin the lily, opening to the breeze; Her cheek was health's inimitable die, And the bright soul sate sparkling in her eye.” She was dressed in white, embroidered and spangled with rich silver lace; a green silk girdle, enwrought and tasselled with gold, surrounded her waist; her hair was unadorned except by a wreath of artificial flowers, on the front of which blazed a single diamond. They remained at New-London some days, which they passed in visiting and in social parties. Bowman was an assiduous attendant upon Melissa; he came one afternoon and invited her to ride out; she excused herself, saying she was indisposed, and Edgar supplied her place. At evening she proposed walking out with Glenford and his lady, but they were prevented by unexpected visitors. Alonzo offered to accompany her. It was one of those beautiful evenings in the month of June when Nature in those parts of America is arrayed in her richest dress. They left the town and strolled through fields adjoining the harbour. The moon shone in full brilliancy, her white beams trembling upon the glassy main, where skiffs and sails of various description were passing and repassing; the shores of Long-Island, and the other islands in the harbour, appeared dimly to float among the waves; the air was odoured with the fragrance of surrounding flowers; the sound of various instrumental music wafting from the town was rendered sweeter by distance, while the whipperwill's sprightly song echoed along the adjacent groves; far in the eastern horizon hung a pile of brazen clouds which had passed from the north, over which the crinkling red lightning momentarily darted, and at times long peals of thunder were faintly heard. They proceeded to a point of the beach where stood a large rock whose base was washed by every tide; there they seated themselves and enjoyed awhile the splendours of the scene— the drapery of nature. “To this place,” said Melissa, “have I taken many a solitary walk on such an evening as the present, and here have I experienced more pleasing sensations than I ever received in the most splendid circles of mirth and gaiety.” The idea impressed the mind of Alonzo; it was congenial with the feelings of his soul. They returned at a late hour, and the next day set out for home. Bowman handed Melissa into the carriage, and with Glenford and his lady accompanied them to Branford, which place they reached about sunset, and lodged there that night at the house of an acquaintance. The next morning they separated; the Glenford party returned to New-London; Edgar with his friend and sister proceeded on, and at evening arrived at his father's house, which was in the western part of the state. Edgar and Alonzo frequently interchanged visits, and they passed some time together in travelling through different parts of America. But the season at length arrived when they must part; the former repaired to New-York where he was to commence his theological studies; the latter entered the office of an eminent attorney in his native town, which was about twenty miles distant from the seat of Col. Bloomfield. Haventon was the frequent guest of this family; for though Edgar was absent, there was still an object which attracted him thither. If he had admired the noble qualifications of the brother, could he fail to adore the sublimer graces of the sister? If all the sympathies of the most ardent friendship had been drawn forth towards the virtues and accomplishments of the one, must not the most tender passions of the soul be attracted by the milder and more refined excellencies of the other? Bowman had become the acknowledged suitor of Melissa, but the distance of his residence rendered it inconvenient to visit her often. He came regularly about once in two or three months, of course Alonzo and he sometimes met. Haventon knew not whether he had made serious pretensions, but his particularity indicated something more than fashionable politeness; his manners, his independent situation, his family, entitled him to respect; it was not probable therefore that he would be objectionable to Melissa's friends— nor to Melissa herself—thought Alonzo, with an involuntary sigh. But as Bowman's visits became more frequent, increasing anxiety was excited in Alonzo's breast; he wished she might remain single; the idea of losing her by marriage gave him inexpressible regret. What substitute could supply the happy hours he had passed in her society, what charm wing the lingering moments when she was gone? In the remission of his studies he could in a few hours be at the seat of her father; there his cares were dissipated, and the troubles of life, real or imaginary, on light pinions fleeted away. How different would be the scene when excluded from the unreserved friendship and conversation of Melissa! And unreserved it could not be were she not completely mistress of herself. But was there not something of a more refined texture than friendship in his predilection for the company of Miss Bloomfield? If so, why not avow it? His prospects, his family, and of course his pretensions, T might not be inferior to those of his rival; but perhaps Bowman was preferred; his opportunities had been greater; he had first formed an acquaintance with her; distance proved no barrier to his addresses; his visits became more frequent: was it not then extremely probable that he had secured her affections? Thus reflected Alonzo, but these reflections tended not to allay the tempest which was gathering in his bosom. He ordered his horse, and was in a short time at Bloomfield Vale. It was summer, and towards evening when he arrived. Melissa was sitting by a window when he entered the hall; she arose and received him with a smile; “I have just been thinking of an evening's ramble,” said she, “but had no one to escort me, and you have come just in time to perform that office. I will order tea immediately, while you rest from the fatigues of your journey.” When tea was served up, a servant entered the room with a paper which he had found in the yard. Melissa received it: “'Tis a letter,” said she, “which I sent by Bowman to a lady in New-London, and the careless man has lost it.” Turning to Alonzo, “I forgot to tell you that your friend has been with us a few days; he left us this morning.” “My friend!” replied Haventon, hastily. “Is he not so?” inquired Melissa. “I beg pardon, Madam,” answered he, “my mind was absent.” “He requested us to present his respects to his friend Alonzo,” said she. Haventon bowed and turned the conversation. They walked out and took a winding path which led along pleasant fields, by a gliding stream, through a little grove, to the top of the high hill called the Mountain, noticed in the early part of this history. A soft and silent shower had descended; a thousand transitory gems trembled upon the foliage, glittering to the western ray; a bright rainbow sat upon an eastern cloud; the light gales sported among the branches, agitated the young harvest to billowy motion, or waved the tops of the distant, deep-green forest with majestic grandeur; flocks, herds and cottages were scattered over the variegated landscape; hills piled on hills, receding, faded from the pursuing eye, mingling with the blue mist which hovered around the extremest verge of the horizon. “This is a most beautiful scene,” said Melissa. “It really is,” replied Haventon; “can New-London boast so charming a prospect?” Melissa. No—yes—indeed I can hardly say. You know, Alonzo, how I was charmed with the rock at the point of the beach. Alonzo. You once mentioned the happy hours you had passed at that place. Perhaps the company which attended you there gave the scenery its highest embellishment. Mel. I know not how it happened; but you are the only person who ever gallanted me there. Al. That is a little surprising. Mel. Why surprising? Al. Where was Bowman? Mel. Perhaps he was not fond of solitude; besides, he was not always my beau-man. Al. Sometimes. Mel. Yes, sometimes. Al. And now always. Mel. Not this evening. Al. He formally addresses you. Mel. Well. Al. And will soon claim the exclusive privilege to that favour. Mel. That does not follow of course. Al. Of course, if his intentions are sincere, and the wishes of another should accord therewith. Mel. Who am I to understand by another? Al. Melissa. [A short silence succeeded.] T 2 Mel. See that ship, Alonzo, coming up the Sound; how it plows through the white foam, while the breezes flutter among the sails as they vary to the beams of the sun. Al. Yes; it is almost down. Mel. What is almost down? Al. The sun. Was you not speaking of the sun, Madam? Mel. Your mind is again absent, Alonzo: I was speaking of yonder ship. Al. I beg pardon, Madam. Oh yes—the ship—it—it bounds with rapid motion over the waves. A pause ensued. They wandered leisurely around the hill and again halted at its top; the sun sank behind western groves; twilight arose in the east and floated along the air; darkness began to hover among the woodlands and valleys; the beauties of the landscape slowly receded: “This reminds me of our walk at New-London,” said Melissa. “Do you remember it?” inquired Alonzo. “Certainly,” she replied; “I shall never forget the sweet pensive scenery of my favourite rock.” “Nor I neither,” he expressively answered. “Seest thou that bright star, Alonzo?” said Melissa, pointing to the planet Venus which glowed resplendently in the west; “how often has my imagination soared to its sphere and anxiously endeavoured to explore its world! What are its inhabitants? Are they a superior order of beings, or mortal like us? Have they their entrances on life and their exits, or is death not known among them? Are they subject to our frailties, our pains and our passions, or do they experience uninterrupted peace and happiness? Such have been the wanderings of inquisitive fancy, when on summer evenings I have contemplated that little luminous orb which in alternate succession, as the poet would say, ushers in the splendours of morning, or follows the track of twilight down the western sky.” “It is a contemplation worthy the soul,” answered Alonzo. “Those numerous globes of light scattered over the heavens are doubtless, many of them, suns, blazing to systems similar to this of which our earth forms a part; a far greater number are probably inhabited worlds, but with what kind of beings, whether spiritual or human, can only be vaguely conjectured: some may be the abodes of angels; others occupied by different species of mortals, superior and inferior to man. Others again are possibly the residence of spirits departed from their bodies, there to remain until the great last day of retribution and decision. Comets, those wild and wandering orbs, may be the habitations of the wicked; the brilliant, shining stars, of the righteous; the former, places of wrath and punishment, the latter, of felicity and joy. That glorious planet, forming a part of our system, and which now attracts your attention, Melissa, may contain within its sphere the happy souls of our dear deceased friends. “The unassisted eye can explore but a small portion of the countless stellar legions sprinkled over the boundless extent of space; glasses of common magnitude show us that the galaxy is composed of an infinite number of stars; telescopes of higher powers disclose, in regions far remote, constellations innumerable. Man, ignorant man, in his circumscribed sphere, knows little, very little of the immensity of creation, the incomprehensible works of Deity.” “These reflections,” returned Melissa, “remind me of a poetic production which my brother wrote and sent to a friend while at College. He favoured me with a copy of it; some parts thereof touch upon the subject you have been treating. You shall see it this evening.” As they were returning they paused to observe a brilliant display of the Aurora Borealis, which had been forming and increasing as twilight decayed. It was grand, beautiful and sublime; a luminous arch extended from the two extremities of the northern horizon, from all parts of which pyramidical pillars of apparent flame shot forth, some of them reaching to the zenith, alternately rising, brightening and fading away; the concave beneath quite to its base was clouded with a substance resembling smoke, interspersed with crimson stains and spots of inconceivable brightness. Suddenly the arch was broken and dissolved; then from adverse points arose numerous columns, flashing, rushing forward, meeting, closing in the centre, and vanishing, like armies engaged in hostile conflict, while just beneath the space they occupied lay a kind of vapour which bore the semblance of blood: shortly the whole disappeared, except a light on the verge of the hoizon like the morning dawn; then at one point masses like smoke and sparkling flame would ascend, similar to those of a burning city, while from a distant quarter of the field the columns again appeared as if marching rapidly towards the conflagration, in long succession, but vanished as they approached it, and soon all faded from the sight. During the existence of the phenomenon there was distinctly heard a low rumbling sound in the region of the north, like the solemn roar of distant winds.[9] [9] This circumstance has been remarked in various similar instances. Melissa inquired what causes were assigned for these singular appearances. “They have never been accounted for,” answered Alonzo, “on correct philosophical principles; conjecture is various; some have supposed them to proceed from the reflections of the sun shining upon mountains of ice in the Greenland seas; others, that they are occasioned by nitrous particles rising in the air, and wafted by northerly winds, till meeting with the warm breezes of the south, corruscations are thus produced. The most modern opinion is that they are effected by certain powers of electricity hitherto not accurately defined. But the irregular order in which they occur proves the incorrectness, or at least the uncertainty of each of these theories. We sometimes may perceive them for several nights in succession, and frequently every week for many months; and then not in a single instance for years. They are common in Canada, Greenland, Iceland and other northern countries, but are recent in southern Europe and America.”[10] [10] We have no account of their appearance in this country previous to about the year 1720; they were very frequent in the time of our revolutionary war, since which they have rarely visited us. After they reached home Melissa put into the hands of Haventon the poem she had mentioned. “You shall judge of Edgar's poetical abilities,” said she, “for intimate as you and he were at College, I think you cannot have seen this; he has often told me that he never submitted the light effusions of his muse, as he styled such performances, to the inspection of any but those to whom they were addressed. It was written on the anniversary of the New Year.” “And to thyself,” said Alonzo. Melissa smiled, and the former read as follows: A NEW-YEAR REFLECTION. Again a weary year expires, And vigourous from its phœnix-fires, The new-born Chief of months aspires Its course to run; While deep in Indian skies retires The sickly sun. The North his stormy vengeance pours; Dark clouds discharge their Greenland stores; Through forests grim the tempest roars, And o'er the waste; Wild shriek mad fiends, while midnight lowers, Thron'd on the blast. From yonder cliff, on mountains high, Hear Time in voice of thunder cry, While giant Echoes back reply, “The Year is fled! Thus all within my realms shall fly To join the dead. “The cottage low, the fabric grand, These mighty piles on which I stand, The system'd heavens, the sea, the land, Their contents all, Shall soon, by this resistless hand, In ruin fall.” The voice of Time, the season drear, The volleying storm, the coffin'd year, The buried earth, the prospect sere, All mark our fate; To prove—ere long we leave them here— A different state. But what, my friend, that state shall be, Is undisclos'd to you or me— Whether to roam beneath the sea, Or flit the air; Or rove creation's farthest lea— Yon polar star. Whether on angel-wing to fly From orb to orb around the sky, And through Orion's window high, Unlicens'd stray, Or in oblivious silence lie Till the last day. U But why in future mysteries deal, Which learning's code can ne'er reveal? Enough to treat on what we feel, And what we know; The constant woe, the inconstant weal, Of man below. The path of life we all must trace, Through glory some, some through disgrace; Now pleasure bland, now sharp distress, Brings smiles or tears; The first for moments holds its place, The last for years. If wealth or penury be our lot, The splendid dome or lonely cot— Obscure or great, let's heed it not, Nor fret nor mourn; Alike we reach that destined spot, Man's narrow bourne. For yet but few swift suns shall shine, Few moons their lustre loan'd resign, Ere sinks this world of yours and mine, To rise no more Till sounds the trump of Heaven, sublime, Its final roar. 'Tis thus when pondering passing scenes, The soul o'er gloomy prospects leans, The muse, transcribing pensive themes, Her subject rears. Alas! that life is fill'd with dreams Of hopes and fears. May health, content and cheering peace, From sadness, pain and care release My lovely sister dear, nor cease Till time shall end; Then through undying years increase— So prays your friend. The next day Alonzo returned to his studies; but different from his former visits to Melissa, instead of exhilirating his spirits, this had tended to depress them. He doubted whether she was not already engaged to Bowman. His hopes would persuade him that this was not the case; but his fears declared otherwise. Absence and solitude however tended only to increase his anxieties; nor were they alleviated by a letter he received from his friend Vincent, who resided, as has been stated, near Bloomfield Vale, an extract of which follows: “We are soon to have a wedding here; you are acquainted with the parties, Miss Bloomfield and Bowman. Such at least is our opinion from appearances, as the latter is very frequently here. You will undoubtedly be a guest. We had expected that you would have put in your claims, from your particular attention to the lady. She is a fine girl, Haventon.” “I shall never be a guest at Melissa's wedding,” said Alonzo, as he hastily paced the room; “but I will once again see her and bid her a final and lasting adieu before that event occurs; for thereafter I shall visit her no more.” The next day he repaired to her father's; he inquired for Melissa; she was gone with a party to the shores of the Sound, escorted by Bowman. At evening they returned: Bowman and Haventon addressed each other with much seeming cordiality. “You have deceived us, Alonzo,” said Melissa, “we concluded you had forgotten the road to this place.” “Was not that a hasty conclusion, Madam?” replied he. “I think not,” she answered, “if your long absence should be construed into neglect. But we will hear your excuse,” said she, smiling, “when leisure permits, and perhaps pardon you.” He thanked her for such condescension. The next morning Bowman set out for New-London; Haventon observed that he took a tender leave of Melissa, telling her in a low voice that he should have the happiness of seeing her again within two or three weeks. After he was gone, as Melissa and Alonzo were sitting in a room alone, “Well, Sir,” said she, “am I to hear your excuses?” Alonzo. For what fault, Madam? Melissa. For neglecting your friends. Al. I hope it is not so considered, Madam. Mel. Seriously, then, why have you stayed away so long? Has this place no charms in the absence of my brother? Al. Would my presence have added to your felicities, Melissa? Mel. You never came an unwelcome visitor here. U 2 Al. Perhaps I might sometimes be intrusive. Mel. What times? Al. When Bowman is your guest. Mel. I have supposed you were on friendly terms. Al. We are. Mel. Why then intrusive? Al. There are seasons when friendship must yield its pretensions to a superior claim. Mel. Perhaps I do not rightly comprehend the force of that remark. Al. Were Bowman here my position might be demonstrated. Mel. I think I understand you. Al. And acknowledge my observations to be just. Mel. [hesitating.] Yes—I believe—I must. Al. And appropriate? Melissa was silent. Al. You hesitate, Miss Bloomfield. She still made no reply. Al. Will you, Melissa, answer me one question? Mel. [confused.] If it be a proper one. You are entitled to candour. Al. Are you engaged to Bowman? Mel. [colouring.] He has asked me the same question concerning you. Al. Has he obtained an interest in your affections? Mel. [deeply blushing, her eyes cast upon the floor.] He has made the same inquiry respecting you. Al. Has he asked your father's permission to address you? Mel. That I have not permitted him yet to do. Al. Yet? Mel. I assure you I have not. Al. [taking her hand with emotion.] Melissa, I beg you will deal candidly. I am entitled to no claims, but you know what my heart would ask. I will bow to your decision. Bowman or Haventon must relinquish their pretensions: we cannot share the blessing. Mel. [her cheeks suffused with a varying glow, her lips pale, her voice tremulous, her eyes still cast down.] My parents have informed me that it is improper to receive the particular addresses of more than one. I am conscious of my inadvertence, and that the reproof is just: one therefore must be dismissed. But—[again she hesitated.] A considerable pause ensued. At length Alonzo arose, “I will not press you farther,” he said, “I know the delicacy of your feelings, and honour your sincerity; I will not therefore insist on your performing the unpleasant task of discrimination. Your conduct in every point of view has been discrete. I could have no just claims, or if I had, your heart must sanction them, or they would be unhallowed and unjustifiable. I shall ever pray for your felicity. The affections are not under our direction, yet our happiness or misery depends on their influence. Whatever then may be my sufferings, you are unblamable and irreproachable.” He took his hat in extreme agitation and prepared to take his leave. Melissa had recovered in some degree from her embarrassment and collected her scattered spirits. “Your conduct, Alonzo,” said she, “is generous and noble. Will you give yourself the trouble and do me the justice to call here once more?” “I will,” said he, “at any time you shall appoint.” “Four weeks then,” she said, “from this day favour us with a visit, and you shall have my decision and receive a final answer.” “I will be punctual to the time,” he replied, and bade her adieu.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Doubts and fears and glooms, away! Hence, to regions dark and ruthless! Grim despair and sad dismay, Grief and sorrow, all are useless. Joys and soft endearments, come, Sporting round the car of pleasure; Graces gay and raptures young, On these altars pour your treasure. Lester. To Alonzo the time now moved with slow and heavy pace; cheerfulness had deserted his bosom; he wooed the silent and solitary haunts of melancholy; he loved to wander through lonely fields, or along the verge of some lingering stream, in that solemn hour when, at the close of day, thick, cloudy curtains are suspended around the sky, and hoarse, hollow winds blow the signal of approaching storms; he was fondly indulging a tender passion which preyed upon his peace and deeply disturbed his repose: he looked anxiously to the hour when Melissa was to make her decision, and wished yet dreaded to encounter the event; in that he foresaw a withering blight to his late springing hopes, and a fatal consummation of his foreboding fears. He had pressed Melissa perhaps too urgently to a declaration. Had her predilection been in his favour, would she have hesitated to avow it? Her parents advised her to relinquish, and permitted her to retain, one suitor, nor had they attempted to influence or forestal her choice. Was it not evident then from her confused hesitation and embarrassment when solicited to discriminate, that her ultimate decision would be in favour of Bowman? While his mind was thus agitated he received a second letter from Vincent, in which he read the following clause with emotions more easily conceived than expressed: “Melissa's wedding-day is appointed. I need not tell you that Bowman is to be the happy deity of the Hymenial sacrifice. I received this from himself. He did not name the day, but it is certainly to be soon. You will undoubtedly however have timely notice. We must pour a free libation on the mystic altar, Haventon, and twine the nuptial garland with wreaths of joy. Bowman ought to devote a rich offering to so valuable a prize. He has been here a week, and departed for New-London yesterday, but it shortly to return.” “And why have I ever doubted this event?” thought Alonzo. “What infatuation hath thus led me on the pursuit of fantastic and unreal bliss? I have had, it is true, no positive assurances that Melissa would sanction my addresses. But why then did she ever receive them? Why enchantingly smile upon me? Why fascinate the tender powers of my soul by that winning mildness, and the favourable display of those complicated and superior attractions which she must have known were irresistible? Why did she not spurn me from her confidence and plainly tell me that my attentions were untimely and improper? And now she would have me dance attendance to her decision in favour of my rival—Insulting!—Let Bowman and she make, as they have planned, this farcical decision; I assuredly will never witness it—Yet I have engaged to see her at an appointed time; my honour is pledged for an interview; it must therefore take place. I shall support it with becoming dignity, and will convince both Miss Bloomfield and her gallant that I am not the dupe of their intrigues and caprices— X But still, what has Melissa done to deserve censure or reproach? Her brother was my early and esteemed companion; she has treated me only as his friend. She was the unsuspecting object of my passion; was unconscious of the flame which her charms had kindled in my bosom. Her evident embarrassment and confusion on receiving my declaration evinced her surprise and prior attachment. What could she do? To save herself the pain of a direct refusal, she has fixed a time when the rejection may come in a more delicate and formal manner—and I must meet it.” On the appointed day Alonzo proceeded to the house of Col. Bloomfield, where he arrived late in the afternoon. Melissa had retired to a little summer-house at the end of the garden; a servant conducted him thither. She was dressed in a flowing robe of green silk, embroidered with yellow fringe lace. Her hair fell in waving circles; in her hand was a boquette of flowers, which she seemed to be critically examining. Haventon fancied she had never appeared so lovely. She arose to receive him. “We have expected you for some time,” said she; “I was anxious to inform you that we have just received a letter from my brother, in which he desires us to present you his most friendly respects, and complains of your not writing to him lately so frequently as usual.” Alonzo thanked her for the information, said that business had prevented him; he esteemed Edgar as his most valued friend, and would be more particular in future. “We have been thronged with company for several days,” continued Melissa. “Once a year my father celebrates his birth-day, when we are honoured with such a numerous assembly of uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews and nieces, that were you present you would suppose us related to half the families in Connecticut. The last of this company took their departure yesterday, and I only regret that for nearly a week I have been prevented from visiting my favourite hill, to which you attended me when you was last here. It is much improved since then; a little arbour is built under the large tree on its summit; you will have no objection to view it, Alonzo.” He assured her he accepted the invitation with pleasure, and towards evening they resorted to the place, and seated themselves in the arbour. It was the beginning of autumn, and a yellow hue was spread over the fading charms of nature. The withering forest began to shed its decaying foliage, which light gales pursued along the russet fields. The low sun extended the lengthening shadows; curling smoke ascended from surrounding cottages. A thick fog crept along the valleys; grey mist hovered over the tops of mountains. The glassy surface of the Sound glittered to the sun's departing ray. Solemn herds lowed in monotonous symphony; autumnal insects in sympathetic wailings, plaintively predicted their approaching fate.—“The scene is changed since we last visited this place,” said Melissa; “the gay charms of summer are beginning to decay, and must soon yield their splendours to the rude, despoiling hand of winter.” “That will be the case,” replied Alonzo, “before I shall have the pleasure of your company here again.” Melissa. Perhaps so; though it is nearly two months yet to winter. Alonzo. Great changes may take place within that time. Mel. Yes; changes must take place; but none I hope, to imbitter present prospects. Al. [peevishly.] As it respects yourself, I trust not, madam. Mel. [tenderly.] And, I sincerely hope, not as it respects you, Alonzo. Al. That wish—I think—is vain. Mel. Why so ominous a prediction? Al. The premises whence it is drawn are correct. Mel. Your feelings accord with the season; Alonzo; you are melancholy. Shall we return? Al. I ask pardon, madam; I am unsociable. X 2 Yes we will return; but you know the occasion of my being here. Mel. For the purpose of visiting your friends, I presume, [smiling.] Al. And for no other purpose? Melissa did not reply. Al. You cannot have forgotten your own appointment, and consequent engagement. She made no answer. Al. I know Miss Bloomfield— Mel. [interrupting him.] Call me Melissa; that name sounds better from you. Al. Why better? Mel. I cannot tell; but it does so. Al. I know Melissa, that you are incapable of duplicity or evasion. I have promised and now repeat the declaraton, that I will silently submit to your decision. This you have engaged to make, and the time you appointed for that purpose has now arrived. The pains of present suspense can scarcely be surpassed by the pangs of disappointment. On your part you have nothing to fear. I trust you have candidly determined, and will decide explicitly. Mel. [sighing.] I am placed in an exceedingly delicate situation. Al. I know you are; but your own honour, your own peace, require that you should extricate yourself from the perplexing embarrassment. Mel. I am sensible they do. It must—it shall be done. Al. And the sooner it is done the better. Mel. That I am convinced of. I now know that I have been inadvertently indiscreet. I have admitted the addresses of Bowman and yourself, without calculating or expecting the consequences. You have both treated me honourably and with respect. You are on equal grounds as to character and standing in life. With Bowman I became first acquainted. As it relates to him, some new arrangements have taken place since you were here, which— Al. [interrupting her, with emotion.] Of those arrangements I have been apprized. Mel. [surprised.] By what means were you informed thereof? Al. I received the intelligence from a friend in your neighbourhood. A considerable pause ensued. Al. You see, Melissa, I am prepared for the event. She was still silent. Al. I have mentioned before, that whatever be your determination, no impropriety can attach to you. I might not, indeed, from various circumstances, and from the information I possess perhaps should not, have given you farther trouble on the occasion, had it not been by your own direction and appointment: and I am now willing to retire without farther explanation; without giving you the pain of an express decision, if you think the measure expedient; your declaration can only be a matter of form, and my proposition may save your feelings. Mel. No, Alonzo; my reputation depends on an adherence to my first determination; justice to yourself, and to Bowman also, demands it: after what has passed, I should be considered as acting capriciously and inconsissently, should I depart from it. Bowman will be here tomorrow, and— Al. Tommorrow, Madam? Mel. He will be here tomorrow, and you must consent to stay with us until that time; the affair shall then be decided. Al. I—Yes—I will—It shall be as you say, Madam. Make your arrangements as you please. Evening spread her dusky mantle over the face of nature; the stars glistened in the sky; the plaintive sound of the low murmuring brook and the far-off water-fall were faintly heard; the twinkling fire-fly[11] [11] The American Lampyris, vulgarly called the Lightning-Bug. arose from the surrounding verdure, and illuminated the air with a thousand transient gleams; the mingling discordance of curs and watch-dogs echoed in the distant village, from whence the frequent lights darted their pale lustre through the gloom; the solitary whipperwills stationed themselves along the woody glens, the groves and rocky pastures, and sang a requiem to departed summer: a dark cloud was rising in the west, across whose gloomy front the vivid lightning bent its forky spires. Alonzo and Melissa moved slowly to the villa; she appeared enraptured with the melancholy splendours of the evening, but other subjects engaged the mental attention of Haventon. Bowman arrived the next day in high spirits; he gave his hand to Alonzo with the seeming warmth of friendship; if it was reciprocated it must have been affected: there was no alteration in the manners and conduct of Melissa; her conversation as usual was sprightly and interesting: after dinner she retired, and her father requested Haventon and Bowman to withdraw with him to a private room. When they were seated the Colonel thus tersely addressed them: “I have called you here, Gentlemen, to perform my duty as a parent to my daughter and as a friend to you. You are both suitors to Melissa; while your addresses were merely formal they were innocent; but when they became serious they were dangerous. Your pretensions I consider equal, and between honourable characters who are worthy of my daughter I shall not attempt to influence her choice; that choice however can rest only on one; she has engaged to decide between you; I am come in her name to make this decision. The following are my terms: No quarrel or animosity shall arise between you in consequence of her determination. Nothing shall go abroad respecting the affair; it shall be ended as it commenced, under my roof. Soon as I have pronounced her declaration you shall both depart and remain absent from my house for at least two weeks, as it would be improper for my daughter to see either of you at present. After that period I shall be happy to receive your visits as friends of my family and of each other.” They both pledged their honour to abide explicitly by these injunctions. He then continued: “This, Gentlemen, is all I require. I have remarked that I considered your pretensions equal; so has my daughter treated them. You have both made professions to her; she has appointed a time to answer you; that time has arrived, and I now inform you that she has decided in favour of Haventon.” This declaration burst upon the mental powers of Bowman like a sudden and tremendous clap of thunder on the deep and solemn silence of night. Unaccustomed to disappointment, he had calculated on success; his addresses to the ladies had ever been honourably received; Melissa was the first whose charms were capable of rendering them sincere. He was not ignorant of Alonzo's attention to her; it gave him however little uneasiness, confident that his superior accomplishments would eclipse the qualifications of his rival. He considered himself a connoisseur in character, especially in that of the ladies; he conformed to their taste, flattered their foibles and obsequiously bowed to the minutia of female volatility. Skilled in the language of the heart, he trusted that, from his pre-eminent powers in the science of offection, he had only to see, to sue and to conquer. He had frankly offered his hand to Melissa, and pressed her for a decisive reply; this from time to time she evaded or suspended, but finally appointed a day to give both him and Alonzo a determinate answer, though neither knew the arrangement made with the other. Finding however the dilemma in which she was placed, she had previously consulted her parents; they had no objection to her choosing between two persons of equal claims to affluence and reputation; this choice she had made, and her father was considered the most proper person to declare it. When Bowman had urged his suit he supposed that her hesitations, delays and suspensions were only the effect of maiden diffidence and timidity; he had no suspicion of her ultimately rejecting it; and when she finally named the day of decision, he felt assured of success. These sentiments he had communicated to Vincent, intimating that Melissa Y had fixed a time which was to crown his happiest wishes. He listened therefore attentively to the observations of Col. Bloomfield, momentarily expecting to hear himself named the favourite choice of the fair. What then must have been his disappointment when the name of Haventon was pronounced instead of his own! The highly finished scene of pleasure and future felicity which his ardent imagination had depicted, vanished in a moment. The rainbow-glories which gilded his youthful horizon instantly faded; the bright sun of his early hopes descended in mournful darkness. The summons of death would not have been more unexpected, or more shocking to his imagination. Very different were the sensations which inspired the bosom of Alonzo. He had not even calculated on a declaration in his own favour. He believed that Bowman would be the choice of Melissa; she had told him that the form of decision was necessary to save appearances; with this he complied because she desired it, not that he expected a result so consonant to his wishes; of course he had not attended to the words of her father with that eagerness which pleasing anticipations commonly excite; but when his name was mentioned, when he found he was the choice, the happy favourite of Melissa's affection, all the passions of his breast became interested and were suddenly aroused to the refinements of sensibility; like an electric shock it reanimated his whole frame and vibrated every nerve of feeling; the glooms which hung about his mind were dispersed and the bright morning of joy broke in upon his soul. Thus were the expectations of both Haventon and Bowman disappointed; how differently the sequel has shown. Col. Bloomfield retired immediately after announcing his daughter's choice; the young gentlemen also soon after withdrew. Alonzo saw the tempest which tore the bosom of his rival, and he pitied him from his heart. A month passed, and Haventon felt all that anxiety and impatience which separation from a beloved object can produce; he framed a thousand excuses to visit Melissa, yet he feared a visit might be premature; he determined however to write; he perceived she was fond of poetry, which as an amusement had employed his leisure hours: the season presented a subject; he therefore composed and sent her the following short poem: LEANDER TO LOUISA. AUTUMNAL ODE. Chill blows the breeze Through faded trees; The withering leaves their branches fly; O'er dreary plains Sad ruin reigns, And curling vapours gloom the sky. Tow'rds southern isles, Where Verna smiles, The cheerers of the grove repair, On sportive wing, Those woods to ring, And sing their loves and pleasures there. Could you and I, Louisa, fly, Like passing birds, from clime to clime, No scowling care Our joys should share, If Heaven permit to call thee mine. What hopes and fears Alarm our years, Amid this world of changing woe! Like summer skies, Each pleasure flies, When angry winds of winter blow. All round the fields The landscape yields One gloomy prospect, wild and bare; A sure presage Of hastening age, Which beauty, youth, nor health will spare. If in the mind The source we find Of sorrowing years, or hours of bliss; Louisa, why Should you and I Our passions guide the prize to miss? While time rolls on To worlds unknown, 'Tis ours the present good to share; Tread fairy scenes In pleasing dreams, And stamp each stormy season fair. Spring's spangling flowers, Calm summer's showers, Mild autumn's fruit, stern winter's snow, Will cheerless prove Unblest by love; Hence all our pleas'd sensations flow. In order to divert his mind by variety, he rode into the country, where he passed several Y 2 days in excursions among the different towns and villages. On his return he was overtaken one day towards evening by a sudden shower of rain; he discovered a farm-house at a little distance from the road; thither he hastened to gain shelter from the approaching storm; the owner of the mansion met him at the door, politely invited him to alight and walk in, while a servant stood ready to take his horse; he was ushered into a large room neatly furnished, where the family and several young ladies were sitting. As Alonzo glanced his eyes hastily around the circle, he thought he recognized a familiar countenance; a hurried succession of confused ideas for a moment crossed his recollection; in an instant he discovered that it was Miss Bloom-field: by this unexpected meeting they were both completely embarrassed; Melissa however arose, and in rather a confused manner introduced Haventon to the family of Bergher and the ladies, as a college-student with her brother. The rain continued most part of the afternoon. Alonzo was invited and consented to stay all night. A moonlight evening succeeded the shower, which induced the company to walk in an adjoining garden. Melissa gave Alonzo an abstract of Bergher's history, and told him that as their families were distantly related, she had been invited there to pass a week, and expected to return within two days; and she added, smiling, “Perhaps, Alonzo, we may have an opportunity once more to visit the bower on my prospect-hill before winter entirely destroys the remaining beauties of summer; there I will repeat your Autumnal Ode, for which I have yet to thank you.” Alonzo felt all the force of the remark; he recoilected the conversation when they were last at the place she mentioned, and he well remembered his feelings on that occasion. “Great changes indeed,” he replied, “have taken place since we were there; that they are productive of unexpected and unexampled happiness to me, is due, Melissa, to you alone.” Haventon departed the next morning, appointing the following week to visit Melissa at her father's house. Thus were the obstacles removed which presented a barrier to the united wishes of Alonzo and Melissa. They had not, it is true, been separated by wide seas, unfeeling parents, or the rigourous laws of war; but troubles, vexations, doubts and difficulties had thus far attended them, which were now dissipated, and they predicted no unpropitious event which might thwart their future union. All the time that Alonzo could spare from his business was devoted to Melissa, and their parents began to calculate on joining their hands soon as his term of professional studies was completed. The troubles which gave rise to the disseveration of America from England had already commenced, which broke out the preceding spring into open hostilities by the conflict at Lexington, followed soon after by the battle of Bunker's Hill. The panic and general bustle which took place in America on these events is yet well remembered by many. They were not calculated to impress the mind of Melissa with the most pleasing sensations; she foresaw that the burden of the war must rest on the American youth, and she trembled in anticipation for the fate of Alonzo; he with others, should the war continue, must take the field in defence of his country. The effects of such a separation were dubious and gloomy. Haventon and she frequently discoursed upon this subject. “I must know your sentiments, Alonzo, on these matters,” said she, in one of those conversations. “You shall have them,” he replied; and the next time they met he put into her hands the following article of his own production: LEANDER'S WISH. God grant that Peace, again, Extend her blissful reign O'er ravag'd climes; Her mild and genial sway, May murdering man obey, And nations hail the day Of bloodless times. Thron'd on his fiery car, Behold the tyrant War O'er carnage ride; See round our trembling shore Britain's dread thunders roar, While gasping mortals pour The encrimson'd tide! Here dusky wreaths aspire From cities wrapt in fire, And towns in flame; There leaden hailstones fly, While groans ascend the sky, And mangled thousands lie On battle's plain. The slave and reverend sage, Green youth and white-hair'd age, To war must bow; The matron, fate should spare, The maiden, heavenly fair, The infant, void of care, Alike laid low. Loud blow the trump of fame, Resound the hero's name Through realms afar; Let martial millions hear, And bright in arms appear; Still will I drop the tear O'er scenes of war. To some sequester'd vale, Where ease and peace prevail, May I retire; With sweets of liberty, My mind should there be free, Louisa! bless'd with thee, My soul's desire. The Attorney in whose office Alonzo was clerk received a commission, and with the new-raised American troops marched to join the army near Boston; his business was consequently suspended, and Haventon returned to the house of his father: he perceived that he could not long remain a mere spectator of the contest, and that it might soon be his duty to take the field; he therefore concluded it best to hasten his marriage with Melissa; she consented to the proposition, and their parents made the necessary arrangements for the event. They even fixed upon the place which was to be their future residence: it was a pleasantly situated village, surrounded by rugged elevations which gave an air of serenity and seclusion to the valley which they encircled: on the south arose a spacious hill which was ascended by a gradual acclivity, its sides and summit interspersed with orchards and cultured grounds: on the west, forests unevenly lifted their rude heads, with here and there a solitary field newly cleared, and thinly scattered with cottages: to the east the eye surveyed a soil in some places swelling into craggy cliffs, in others spreading itself into vales of the most enchanting verdure: to the north it extended over a vast succession of mountains wooded to their summits, and throwing their shadows over intervales of equal wilderness, till at length it was arrested in its excursions by the blue mists which hovered over mountains more grand, majestic and lofty: a rivulet which rushed from the hills formed a little lake on the borders of the village, which beautifully reflected the cottages from its transparent bosom: amidst a cluster of locusts and weeping willows, rose the spire of the church in the ungarnished decency of Sunday neatness: fields, gardens, meadows and pastures were spread around the valley and on the sides of the declivities, yielding in their season the rich flowers, fruits and foliage of spring, summer and autumn. The inhabitants of this new Avernum were principally farmers; they were mild, sociable, moral and diligent; the produce of their own flocks and farms gave them most of their food and clothing; to dissipation they were strangers, and the luxuries of their tables were few. Such was the place selected for the habitation of Alonzo and Melissa. They had visited the spot and were enraptured with its pensive, romantic beauties. A site was marked out whereon to erect their family mansion: it was on a little eminence which sloped gradually to the lake, in the most pleasant part of the village. “Here,” said Alonzo one day to Melissa, “will we pass our lives in all that felicity of mind which the chequered scenes of time admit. In the spring we will rove among the flowers; in summer we will gather strawberries in yonder fields, or hurtleberries from the adjacent shrubbery. The breezes of fragrant morning and the sighs of evening gales will mingle with the songs of numerous birds which frequent the surrounding groves. We will collect the bending fruits of autumn, and we will listen to the hoarse voice of winter, its whistling winds, its driving snow and rattling hail, with delight.” Tears of joy glistened in the eyes of Melissa: with a glowing smile she expressively exclaimed, “This shall be my Asylum.” “And when erected, Asylum shall be the name of our happy seat,” returned Alonzo, with emphatic ardency. Winter came on; it rapidly passed away; spring advanced, and the marriage day was appointed. END OF VOL. I.</field>
