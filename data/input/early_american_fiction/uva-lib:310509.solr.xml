Be it remembered, that on the tenth day of June, in the fortieth year of the Independence of the United States of America, Charles, N. Baldwin, of the said district, hath deposited in this office the title of a book the right whereof he claims as proprietor, in the words and figures following, to wit: “The Champions of Freedom, or the Mysterious Chief, a Romance of the Nineteenth Century; founded on the Events of the War between the United States and Great-Britain, which terminated in March, 1815. By Samuel Woodworth. “Miracles our Champions wrought, Who their daring deeds shall tell? O, how gloriously they fought! How triumphantly they fell!” —Montgomery. In conformity to the Act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the time therein mentioned.” And also to an Act entitled “An Act, Supplementary to an Act, entitled `An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned,' and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.” THERON RUDD, Clerk of the Southern District of New-York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIV. THE SURRENDER. If nothing more than purpose in thine power, Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed; Who does the best his circumstance allows, Does well, acts nobly—angels could no more. Young. The rocky precipice which now sheltered these few “hardy gleanings” of so many desperate fights, was within a few paces of the river's margin; but not a boat was there to receive them. In this extremely painful situation they remained many minutes, when they found themselves suddenly surrounded by more than five times their number; and knowing that a further resistance would produce an useless effusion of blood, they reluctantly complied with their leader's advice, who sighed in the performance of what had now become a necessary duty, for the prevention of a greater sacrifice. They threw down their arms in sullen despondency, which Scott, with a graceful dignity peculiar to himself, tendered his sword to his more fortunate opponent. Wadsworth, who, with his faithful followers, had been a sharer in the dangers and glory of five victorious conflicts, was also compelled to participate in the reverses of the day. The remaining militia under his command, amounting to one hundred and fifty men, relinquished their well-tried arms to the enemy, and became prisoners of war. After the surrender, an Indian advanced to Scott, surveyed him very attentively for some time, and then addressed him—“You are not born to be shot. So many times—(holding up all the fingers of both hands, to count ten)—so many times have I levelled and fired my rifle at you. Scott was in full uniform, and being remarkable for his stature, was evidently a fair mark for a sharp-shooter. Under the rocks and fissures of the precipice, were upwards of one hundred militia, whose constitutional scruples had been so far overcome as to permit them to cross the river, but they had not ventured to ascend the precipice, or appear in sight of the enemy! What a mortifying discovery must this have been to those brave fellows who had now sought shelter there, almost exhausted with fatigue, from a contest of eleven hours with no ordinary enemy, either for numbers or courage! I sincerely lament that the duty of a faithful historian compels me to record this fact. But to return. During the short cessation of slaughter which succeeded the fall of Brock and the dispersion of 26* his followers, the wounded received such attentions as situation and circumstances would permit. The bullet which had entered the thigh of ensign Willoughby, was easily extracted on the opposite side, it having glanced the bone, and passed almost through; when, as soon as the bleeding was stanched, he insisted on resuming his former position in the line, where he continued during two furious assaults of the enemy, who was defeated in each. In the third, however, which terminated the contest, George had become so exhausted with fatigue and loss of blood, that he fainted a moment before the Americans gave way, and fell among a promiscuous heap of friends and foes, who had met in the arms of death. When he recovered his recollection, a gigantic savage was standing over him, rifling the pockets of his coat, which had been stripped from his body. In a moment the miniature of Catharine caught his eye—it had been torn from his neck, and was now suspended at the Indian's girdle. Our hero took no time for reflection, but starting on his feet, seized the unguarded and astonished savage by the throat, and threw him on the ground, where he was just on the point of regaining his lost treasure, when his arm was arrested, and he found himself surrounded by a dozen more, with suspended tomahawks, and looks less expressive of vengeance than of wonder, at his daring temerity. Knowing that he must now, in all human probability, fall a sacrifice to their fury, he only thought of selling his life as dearly as possible. But he was unarmed; the bandage had broken loose from his wound, which was bleeding afresh, and he felt that his newly-recovered strength was rapidly declining. He looked round upon his enemies in despair, and again sank nerveless on the ground. Two of the savages immediately raised him, and after venting a fiend-like laugh at their fallen comrade, each seized an arm of our hero, and forced him along between them through the scene of carnage which the hill presented. Here many of these merciless monsters were engaged in stripping and scalping the dying and the slain. George recognised the lifeless bodies of several of his friends, stripped even of their linen, scalped, and horribly mangled; some, who had only received a shot-wound in the limbs, and had fallen through weakness, now presented scalpless sculls cloven entirely in two by the hatchets of these barbarous wretches. He shuddered at the contemplation of a fate which his sudden recovery had certainly deferred—perhaps wholly averted. They descended the western declivity of the hill, and George was delivered into the hands of the English. He could have thanked the savages for their unexpected clemency, but the jewel of which they had rifled him suddenly darted across his recollection, and he exclaimed, in a tone of frenzy—“Monsters! restore me my treasure!” His exclamation, however, excited no attention; and he was consigned to the care of a surgeon, after receiving a very flattering encomium from the British officers for his conspicuous bravery during the active duties of the day. It gives me pleasure to add, upon the best authority, that the treatment which the wounded prisoners received from the English officers and surgeons on this occasion, was marked with proper delicacy, tenderness, and respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXV. AN EVENING IN BOSTON. As softest metals are not slow to melt, So pity soonest runs in gentle minds. Dryden. The blustering van of Winter's advancing forces pressed hard upon the rear of retreating Autumn, whose yellow plumes and banners had already disappeared from the frost-crusted plains of New-England, and were waving in more southern climes. The pioneers of the frigid tyrant had stripped the fields of herbage, wasted the meadows, and covered every stream with a crystalline bridge. It was a boisterous evening in the month of November, and the streets of Boston were covered with rain and sleet, when a happy little party, around Orville's parlour fire, were suddenly thrown into consternation by the heart-appalling cry of murder! almost immediately under the window. Orville and Morse flew into the street, and at their approach three ruffians took to their heels, and effected their escape, leaving their bleeding victim prostrate in the gutter. “He lives!” exclaimed Morse, raising the poor wretch's head upon his knee, while he felt the blood gushing on his hand; “Heaven grant that his scull be not fractured.” “I hope not,” returned Orville, as he assisted in lifting him from the ground; “a surgeon must be instantly called.” Lights were now brought, but scarcely any symptoms of life were discernable in the object of their care, whom they now discovered to be a sailor, whose sun-burnt countenance was “marked with many an honest scar.” He was immediately conveyed into the house, and laid on a sofa, while Morse departed for a surgeon, and Ellen assisted Amelia in washing the clotted blood from his temples, and cutting the “gory locks” from a wound on the side of his head. In a short time he recovered so far as to swallow a cordial, and express his gratitude for the kind attention of his fair nurses; he complained of an excruciating pain in the left hip, which he feared had been dislocated in the fall, as he felt it impossible to move. The surgeon now entered with Morse, and having examined the patient, found a severe contusion on his hip, which was much swelled and inflamed; but neither fracture nor dislocation had been produced. The wounds were then properly dressed, the necessary medicines administered, and the grateful tar conveyed to a chamber hastily prepared for his reception, where a faithful domestic was directed to watch by him during the night. Having thus assisted in performing the sacred rites of humanity, Amelia and Morse were preparing to depart, when a rattling peal from the knocker arrested their attention, and in the next moment George Washington Willoughby was locked in his sister's arms. It was some time before the mutual rapture of this unexpected meeting could be articulated in words, or expressed in any other way than by tears and unfinished exclamations. A more tranquil joy, however, succeeded, and their reciprocal inquiries were made and answered in a more intelligible manner. At length the whole party became composed, and took seats around the social hearth. Refreshments were introduced, and Ellen resuming a tone of gaiety peculiar to herself, exclaimed— “But tell us, my hero George, to what miracle do we owe the happiness of this meeting; and who is the adventurous knight that has again unriveted your fetters, and restored you to the arms of friendship, liberty, and love?” “I have returned on parole, my gay cousin, and am doomed to renounce the service of Mars until a British ensign can be found on this side the lines, to break the spell of honor which binds me. Did my sister receive a letter from Queenston?” “I did,” answered Amelia, “and we were all extremely happy that its contents furnished no grounds to support the rumor of your having been wounded in that unfortunate affair.” “Knowing that your affectionate fears would aggravate a mere scratch to something more serious and alarming, I forebore to mention it, and was soon able to walk, when we were all conducted to Quebec as prisoners of war. Before I left Queenston, I recovered the trinket mentioned in my letter as having been stolen by an Indian, and it is to the generous interference of a British officer that I am indebted for its restoration. At Quebec, the brave Scott obtained his parole, as did several others, among whom I was one. We embarked in a cartel, and without any accident arrived in this port a few hours since. I have only been landed long enough to drop a “how d'ye” at my uncle's, and flew immediately hither. And now, tell me something of my father. Who has heard from him?” “I have this day received a long letter from him,” answered Morse, “which you shall read in due time.” “And Amelia has also received a long letter from her wild correspondent,” added Ellen, with an arch smile; “but it contains no mysterious postscript, and consequently you can possess no curiosity to see it.” George turned an eager beseeching look on his sister, and exclaimed—“Tell me, Amelia, how fares my—my father?” “Our friends at and near Mulberry-Grove, are all well,” replied his sister; “male and female— old and young. Let that content you until to-morrow. In the mean time, permit me to introduce to your acquaintance a relation whom you have never seen.” So saying, she rose, and led her brother to a recess where stood a cradle, in which a beautiful infant was sleeping. “There,” she continued, “lies your little cousin, George Cushing Orville, who has this day completed two months of life's little pilgrimage.” George took the infant in his arms, raised its soft cheek to his lips, and after caressing it for a few minutes, returned it to the cradle; then casting an inquiring look at his sister, said— “Perhaps there is also another little stranger who may be still more nearly related to me.” “Short-sighted simpleton!” cried Ellen; but before he could ask an explanation, a servant burst into the room, with a countenance in which terror and alarm were strongly depicted, and begged that one of the gentlemen would hasten up stairs, and endeavour to quiet the wounded sailor, who was raving like a madman. Orville and Morse immediately ascended to the chamber, and without pausing to make any inquiries, our hero darted after them. “Shall we follow?” said Amelia, advancing to the door. “Not for the world,” answered Ellen; “who could answer for the consequences of such a scene on the delicate nerves of one who is—“as women wish to be who love their lords?” If feminine assistance is necessary, I will go by myself.” When the three gentlemen entered the sick man's chamber, they found their patient sitting up in bed, with clenched fists, and eyes rolling in wild frenzy, swearing to annihilate a host of enemies, whom he imagined were ready to assail him. Fortunately he did not mistake his real friends. “Come on, shipmates!” he exclaimed, as they approached the bed; “I've wing'd the lieutenant. Cut down that lubber! Follow up the blow!—down with 'em!—Never submit to a tyrannical press-gang!—They give way!—press on!—Victory!—huzza!” On finishing this strange rhapsody, (which was very thickly interlarded with coarse oaths and other technical phraseology) he made a desperate effort to leap out of bed, but was caught by our hero, and sank exhausted in his arms. His whole frame glowed, and his burning hands and face seemed ready to burst with the fever that raged in his veins. Being again laid on his pillow, he was quiet for some minutes, and in that interval George was made acquainted with the adventure which had introduced the poor sufferer under this hospitable roof. Scarcely was the brief recital finished, when its subject again started; but his eyes now continued closed, and without rising from his pillow, or using any extravagant gestures, he pursued another theme, in broken sentences, and in a much lower tone: “Hist! Now is the time—the darkness—he's not an owl—he can't see the mainmast—hist!— one at a time—chicken-hearted lubber! the sharks are on board—shiver my timbers if I back out!—Now for it—Ah! ah! comfortable—comfortable.” He was again silent, and every muscle seemed to labor in some arduous exercise. Great drops of sweat started from every pore, and he began to breathe more easy; his full high-bounding pulse began gradually to subside, and in less than an hour he awoke with no delirium, and quite free from fever. Having received a draught of some cooling medicine from the hand of Orville, he again expressed his thanks for such kindness to a stranger, and regretted that he had become so troublesome. Orville entreated him to give himself no uneasiness on that score; and perceiving that he was disposed to sleep, recommended him to the particular care of the attendant, and descended to the parlour, where the happy party separated for the night. In the course of the following day the sailor found himself so much better, that he was able 27 to sit up and converse freely; when, at the request of his humane host, he related all that he knew respecting the fracas which had reduced him to the perilous situation from which he had been so providentially extricated. He had just been paid off and discharged from a merchant ship that had lately arrived from France, and was proceeding to his lodgings, when he observed that he was closely followed by two or three suspicious-looking fellows, armed with heavy sticks. Being unconscious of having deserved an enemy, he naturally concluded, that if he was the object of their pursuit, it must be for the purpose of robbing him of his hard-earned money. He turned several corners, and they still continued to dog him, until he concluded to make a stand and demand the cause of this singular pursuit. Instead of answering his inquiry, they seized him by the throat, and endeavoured to stop his mouth with a handkerchief. By a desperate struggle, however, he disengaged himself from their grasp; and finding escape impossible, cried out murder. He could recollect no more, until he found himself on the sofa, attended by the ladies. Both the pockets of his jacket were turned inside out; but fortunately he had secured his money in a morocco purse, which was concealed in the facing of his vest; and the timely interference of Orville and Morse had prevented a further search. In the mean time, our hero had been devouring the contents of his sister's letter from Catharine, in which she had ingenuously confessed to Amelia the present state of her affections, with an artless little history of the rise and progress of a passion which she esteemed the happiness of her life. The catastrophe at Richmond was not forgotten; the meeting in the meadow was delicately painted; and their subsequent engagements, and parting interview, accurately described. What a treat for a lover! “Did I not know you so well, my brother,” said Amelia, as she gave him the letter, “did I not believe your bosom to be the seat of the purest honor, I would not expose you to the intoxicating influence of this cordial. Prove yourself worthy of so sacred a trust.” The concluding paragraph of this letter I have been permitted to transcribe, and is in the following words: “But O, my dear friend! after confiding so much to the sanctity of your breast, how will you believe me, when I assure you that poor Catharine is still unhappy? Think me not childish or capricious—but how can I feel happy when the hazardous profession which this angelic being has chosen may, in one fatal moment, blast my little paradise of hope, and render all the world to me a dreary desert of misery? How soon may that manly form lie bleeding on the cold ground, and those lovely limbs be mangled by trampling horses, or hewed to pieces by the still more merciless savages. A bullet or a sword may pierce that generous heart which throbs with the noblest ardor for his country, and the purest affection for his friends. This is the only reflection that can ever shake my implicit trust in the providence of Heaven. I fear, Amelia—indeed I fear, that such a trial of my strength would find me sadly deficient. Pray for me, that I may never encounter it. Foolish, selfish girl! to forget that I am addressing the sister of such a brother! Let us then mingle our prayers to avert an event, the effects of which would be so fatally extensive.” “To be worthy of such affection,” said George, as he returned the letter to Amelia, “shall be the study of my life; and never can I be sufficiently grateful to my sister for her generous confidence. Did the dear writer of that epistle know the happiness that has been thus clandestinely imparted to her absent friend, she would surely overlook the means, and excuse the agent.” “I would not willingly put her friendship to the test,” answered Amelia; “so enjoy your happiness, but forget the medium through which you received it.” The light-hearted George now endeavored to collect his thoughts for a perusal of his father's letter to Morse, which the reader will find recorded at large in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVI. THE LETTER. —“Can we call conquest ours? Shall man, this pigmy, with a giant's pride, Vaunt of himself, and say—thus have I done this? O vain pretence to greatness! Like the moon, We borrow all the brightness which we boast; Dark in ourselves, and useless. If that hand That rules the fate of battles, strike for us, Crown us with fame, and gild our clay with honor, 'Twere most ungrateful to disown the benefit, And arrogate a pride that is not ours.” Rowe's Tam. “Mulberry-Grove, Ohio, October 22, 1812. “Your last, my son, is now before me, and every sentence yields me pleasure, except that in which you mention Amelia's fears on my account. Assure her from me, that the moment any real cause of alarm presents itself, I shall not be backward in providing for the safety of myself and those under my protection. It grieves me that she should make herself unhappy in anticipating evils that may never arrive. Let me intreat her, through you, to banish every fear for the safety of her father, and repose her trust in that merciful Being who, in the operations of his providence, never permits an evil to take place but for the ultimate good of his creatures; and it is our duty to submit without a murmur. I do not wish it to be understood that the ordinary human means of shunning an impending danger are to be neglected: so far from it, I should conceive that I was tempting the Almighty, to remain in a place of danger, when I could retreat consistently with duty. I repeat, that I will remove from Mulberry-Grove the moment I apprehend any 27* danger from staying. Were it a tenable fortress, the case would be different. Let this assurance restore peace to the bosom of my child. “I have just received an account of the unprofitable contest at Queenston, and I lament to add, that your brother George is again a prisoner of war. A letter from Lewiston assures me that my noble boy behaved in a very gallant manner throughout the whole affair, and this in some measure reconciles me to his renewed captivity. I received a letter from him while at Buffalo, giving an account of the fortunate enterprize which restored him to liberty, with above thirty others, only five days before the Queenston affair; but as you must already be in possession of the particulars, perhaps from his own pen, I shall pass them over unnoticed. “You wish me to “continue a regular detail of war events on the western frontier.” Indeed, you enjoin on me a hard task; for the situation of Mulberry-Grove is not the most eligible for a political observatory. I am sometimes indebted to a Boston newspaper for accounts of events passing in this state. But I will comply with your request as far as practicable, and give you a brief account of every interesting occurrence in the order I receive them. “On the nineteenth of September, general Harrison, pursuant to orders from the war department, relinquished the command of the Northwestern army to brigadier-general Winchester, a gentleman of great respectability and merit, but who does not appear to possess the confidence of the Kentuckians like Harrison. Great discontent and murmuring were produced among the troops when they were informed of the change; but on being addressed by Harrison, they appeared better satisfied. An express from the seat of government, however, has since reached him, with dispatches from the same department, appointing him to the command of all the troops which have been called into service from the western states. He has, therefore, again taken the command of the Northwestern army, and, it is expected, will immediately adopt the most efficient measures to regain Detroit and proceed into Upper Canada. “Among the volunteers from Kentucky, now under Harrison, are the following members of congress: Samuel Hopkins, major-general; Richard M. Johnson, commanding a battalion of mounted rangers; John Simpson, captain; William P. Duval, captain; Samuel M`Kee, private; Thomas Montgomery, private. To the honor of that patriotic state, I can also add, that numbers of the most wealthy and respectable private citizens are in the ranks, who endure all the privations necessarily attendant on a military life, with a degree of subordination never exceeded by regular troops. “During the attack on Fort Wayne by the Indians, mentioned in my last, it is said that the commander, captain Rhea, proposed to surrender; but his subalterns threatened to put him to instant death if he made the proposition again. It was supposed he intended to surrender the fort and make his escape to Detroit. The moment general Harrison arrived, captain Rhea was arrested, and given liberty to resign, or to stand his trial. He chose the former. The firmness of these officers, no doubt, saved the garrison from indiscriminate massacre. “Some particulars respecting another expedition against that post, have just come to my knowledge. About the middle of September, two Indians arrived at Detroit with a letter, which they found on an express whom they had intercepted and killed, and which had been sent by the commander of Fort Wayne to general Harrison, requesting succors, and stating that his situation was critical. The British commander, on the receipt of the letter, immediately sent about one thousand Indians, who had arrived at Detroit since its surrender, with a few regulars, to attack the fort; who proceeded until they came within sixteen miles of an American army, which they learned, from a prisoner their spies took, to be Harrison's. They then precipitately retreated, leaving much of their ammunition, &amp;c. on the ground. “Harrison, I understand, is now employing himself with the greatest zeal, in arranging depots of provisions, clothing, and ammunition; opening roads, building boats, erecting block-houses, &amp;c. preparatory to his march to the borders, whither he shortly proposes to proceed. Several of the Miami and other Indians have come in to him, and thrown themselves on the mercy of the government, agreeing to abide by the decision of the president in relation to them, whatever that may be. “The accounts from Detroit are not very agreeable; almost every day furnishes instances of dishonorable conduct in British officers, who openly and shamefully violate the articles of capitulation. The inhabitants are daily plundered of their private property, and robbed of every thing to which their haughty oppressors take a liking. But the barbarities of the Indians are shocking beyond belief; even the sanctity of the tomb is violated, and dead bodies have been unearthed and stripped of their scalps, which these unprincipled wretches have then sold to their more unprincipled employers; thus at once robbing the dead and cheating the living! The British have almost disrobed Detroit of every thing valuable, and carried it within their lines. They have no expectation of being able to hold the place, and are therefore removing the cannon and ammunition. The fort is now garrisoned by one hundred British regulars. “I can now positively and safely contradict the report that I hinted at in my last, of the defeat and massacre of a detachment from general Perkins' command at the river Huron. The circumstances, which I have since learned, and which may be depended upon, are as follows: General Perkins had detached captain Cotton, with a party of ninety men, to the peninsula of Sandusky, to secure some salt said to be there. On the arrival of the party, they discovered some Indians, whom they immediately attacked; the Indians retired until they were joined by another party, when a brisk fight took place; and had it not been for some misunderstanding of the orders, it is probable the whole of the Indians would have been killed or taken, as the Americans had outflanked and nearly surrounded them. It is, however, satisfactory to add, that the Indians were beaten; and, though the number killed could not be correctly ascertained, there is no doubt but their loss greatly exceeded ours, which was six killed and ten wounded, none of them dangerously. Captain Cotton has returned to camp. “Captain Elliott is making great exertions to secure the command of Lake Erie, for the attainment of which important object a great number of ship-carpenters are put in requisition. May Heaven crown their labors with success, and make them instrumental in restoring a speedy peace. “You request some further observations on the subject of war, and seem not to be entirely satisfied with my attempts to reconcile it with religion. Perhaps you do not sufficiently keep in view the ground on which I found my argument— viz. the present degenerate state of man. Evil is in the world; how it gained a footing here, does not belong to the present subject. It is sufficient for my purpose to know, that all the operations of Providence tend to its removal; it was for this purpose alone that revelation was given, and it is for this purpose alone that wars, pestilences, famines, &amp;c. are permitted to ravage the earth. “There never were but two ways or methods by which the operations of Providence have been carried on: the one by extraordinary, the other by ordinary means; the former may be termed miracles—the latter, natural occurrences. Miracles have long since ceased, because they interfere with the free will of man, forcing an acquiesence from the understanding, without reforming his heart. The only possible manner, then, in which evil can be gradually removed from the world, (consistently with that freedom of will which makes us men) is by spiritual instruments; and, as it would be out of order for good spirits to be employed in such dirty work, and as evil spirits always stand ready to do such work, the Almighty permits them, under proper restraints, to stir up nation against nation—set the great cauldron boiling, and take the scum for their trouble. “But you will ask, if the removal of evil is all that is intended in the permission of wars, pestilences, famines, and the rest, how happens it that the good suffer equally with the bad? “To this I answer—The good are permitted to be thus afflicted in order to make them still better, by increasing their patience, humility, and dependence on Heaven. And when they are finally removed from this life by one of these same instruments, they enter into a state of never-ending felicity, where these instruments can no more reach them or afflict them. With the wilfully wicked the case is different; by permitting them to be cut off, the hereditary love of evil which they derived from their parents, (and which, instead of combatting and subduing, they have increased by unrestrained indulgence) is thus arrested and prevented from descending to a numerous progeny, who might in their turn transmit the accumulated load to the next generation, until the world would be again reduced to that state which once caused its destruction by a deluge. “But, admitting all this, you may then ask— How can good men conscientiously assist in this work of devils, for the performance of which there are, alas! too many instruments instigated by passions altogether suitable for the diabolical employment? “This brings us to the main point of the subject, and will lead me to notice a very nice distinction. “No good man can, conscientiously and voluntarily, take up arms in an offensive war, unless he do so to prevent the still greater evil of disobeying those in authority, (which we are expressly forbidden by religion to do) and thereby promote civil dissentions. But in a war altogether defensive, like the one in which we are now engaged, every good man, I believe, may safely take a part, and do so from the purest motives. I must insist upon it, that in our present low state of goodness, means correspondingly low must be resorted to, to defend our just and unalienable rights. Were we without sin, other means would doubtless be provided by Providence; as we are not, we have no right to expect them. It is surely justifiable self-defence to strike a weapon from the hand of an assailant; or, if that weapon is raised against us, to strike off the arm that wields it. Canada is that arm—the Indian scalping knife is the weapon it wields. If we cannot repel the weapon, let us attempt to cut off the arm. “I have already given you the substance of a conversation I once had on this subject with general Brown, before he had entirely discarded the prejudices of the sect in whose tenets he was educated. He was then a quaker, and I believe a most excellent man; nor is he the less so for being now in the field, ready to chastise the enemies of freedom. It is possible that some people might draw from that conversation a mistaken inference, and imagine that I was combatting the principle of peace itself, when I was only contending against the enthusiastic delusions which men have fallen into by mistaking the genuine sense and meaning of our religion. If a Millenium is ever to bless the world, or the Saturnian age to return, I am confident that it will not be brought about exclusively by Quakers; it must be effected by a radical change and reform in the heads and hearts of mankind. When such a reform becomes so extensive as to find its way into our political bodies, its effects will be exhibited in the sphere of politics. Politicians will then forget all party distinctions, and the friends of peace will discard that enthusiasm which assumes credit for ideal virtues that cannot be practised. They will be men on a proper level with the business of the world in which they live, and, therefore, Christians, truly sane and efficient. “The Quakers all profess to be the disciples of Peace; and, in order not to be mistaken by the world on this point, have assumed a peculiar garb, speech, and manners. But is it not highly probable that many among them may be merely externally friends; men who indulge their unbridled passions in the political contests around them, their bosoms burning like a fiery furnace, with every malignant and furious passion that is common to the wicked? If there are such, what will the external garb of peace avail them, while they have no peace within? What can avail the cut of their coat, the nicety of their grammar, or the peculiarity of their calendar? To such I would say, “Assume the military uniform of your country; in that character you may become useful; let your furious passions, your subtle selfish cunning, operate against the open enemies of your country, rather than expend their malignant influence on your neighbors and fellow-citizens. Ye are cut-throats internally—you may as well be so externally: your damnation would not be more certain.” 28 “The creed or discipline that gives no latitude for the exercise of private judgment, is a wrong one; for the soul that is panting for war, should no more be restrained by the discipline of his sect from taking the field, than one of a contrary disposition should be compelled to go into it. The man who shoulders his musket conscientiously, may be a faithful christian. The man who cheerfully pays others because he thinks that they are fitter than himself, by nature or education, for such purpose, may also be a good christian. The quakers say, he only who resists not, but trusts to Heaven for protection, is a good christian. “Whatever be a man's religious or political creed, if he be honest and peaceable, uncontroled by selfish interests, prejudice, and bigotry, an observer of the golden rule, and a lover of usefulness—every good christian ought to hail him as a brother, whether his coat be drab or scarlet— whether he has conscientiously taken up arms, or conscientiously refused to take up arms. “The sect of the quakers tacitly declare to all others, you must join, or fight for us. Now, it may happen, and indeed does actually happen, that very many do not approve of the creed and discipline of the quakers; the option then seems to be rather a hard one, and inconsistent with the general principles of justice; for if, in order to avoid war, we go into society, we must violate conscience; if we do not go in, but go out to war, we are reprobated as anti-christians, even when fighting their battles, which they unjustly refuse to do; so that we appear in a dilemma, from which there are no means of release but in breaking down the creed itself. “When we speak of a man trusting in Heaven for protection, we should always think of a protection according to the proper and regular order established by law, not in an imaginary state of things, taking rise in delusions. On this point we have an excellent lesson from Scripture, where Satan, by an affectation of such a trust, desires the Redeemer to cast himself from the pinnacle of the temple; the reply to which should be always present to every christian, for it expressly forbids us thus to tempt the Almighty, by any improper or eccentric departure from the established order even of external or natural things. “The true state of the case is this: when the necessity for war shall cease, then war will cease, and not before; for whilst there are bad men to commit aggressions, the best of men must defend themselves, and by carnal weapons too, if necessary. A contrary doctrine is just as absurd as for a shepherd to go home with his dog, and trust to Providence to protect the sheep, when surrounded by wolves. “But I shall trespass on your patience, and therefore adieu for the present.

With the wilfully wicked the case is different; by permitting them to be cut off, the hereditary love of evil which they derived from their parents, (and which, instead of combatting and subduing, they have increased by unrestrained indulgence) is thus arrested and prevented from descending to a numerous progeny, who might in their turn transmit the accumulated load to the next generation, until the world would be again reduced to that state which once caused its destruction by a deluge. “But, admitting all this, you may then ask— How can good men conscientiously assist in this work of devils, for the performance of which there are, alas! too many instruments instigated by passions altogether suitable for the diabolical employment? “This brings us to the main point of the subject, and will lead me to notice a very nice distinction. “No good man can, conscientiously and voluntarily, take up arms in an offensive war, unless he do so to prevent the still greater evil of disobeying those in authority, (which we are expressly forbidden by religion to do) and thereby promote civil dissentions. But in a war altogether defensive, like the one in which we are now engaged, every good man, I believe, may safely take a part, and do so from the purest motives. I must insist upon it, that in our present low state of goodness, means correspondingly low must be resorted to, to defend our just and unalienable rights. Were we without sin, other means would doubtless be provided by Providence; as we are not, we have no right to expect them. It is surely justifiable self-defence to strike a weapon from the hand of an assailant; or, if that weapon is raised against us, to strike off the arm that wields it. Canada is that arm—the Indian scalping knife is the weapon it wields. If we cannot repel the weapon, let us attempt to cut off the arm. “I have already given you the substance of a conversation I once had on this subject with general Brown, before he had entirely discarded the prejudices of the sect in whose tenets he was educated. He was then a quaker, and I believe a most excellent man; nor is he the less so for being now in the field, ready to chastise the enemies of freedom. It is possible that some people might draw from that conversation a mistaken inference, and imagine that I was combatting the principle of peace itself, when I was only contending against the enthusiastic delusions which men have fallen into by mistaking the genuine sense and meaning of our religion. If a Millenium is ever to bless the world, or the Saturnian age to return, I am confident that it will not be brought about exclusively by Quakers; it must be effected by a radical change and reform in the heads and hearts of mankind. When such a reform becomes so extensive as to find its way into our political bodies, its effects will be exhibited in the sphere of politics. Politicians will then forget all party distinctions, and the friends of peace will discard that enthusiasm which assumes credit for ideal virtues that cannot be practised. They will be men on a proper level with the business of the world in which they live, and, therefore, Christians, truly sane and efficient. “The Quakers all profess to be the disciples of Peace; and, in order not to be mistaken by the world on this point, have assumed a peculiar garb, speech, and manners. But is it not highly probable that many among them may be merely externally friends; men who indulge their unbridled passions in the political contests around them, their bosoms burning like a fiery furnace, with every malignant and furious passion that is common to the wicked? If there are such, what will the external garb of peace avail them, while they have no peace within? What can avail the cut of their coat, the nicety of their grammar, or the peculiarity of their calendar? To such I would say, “Assume the military uniform of your country; in that character you may become useful; let your furious passions, your subtle selfish cunning, operate against the open enemies of your country, rather than expend their malignant influence on your neighbors and fellow-citizens. Ye are cut-throats internally—you may as well be so externally: your damnation would not be more certain.” 28 “The creed or discipline that gives no latitude for the exercise of private judgment, is a wrong one; for the soul that is panting for war, should no more be restrained by the discipline of his sect from taking the field, than one of a contrary disposition should be compelled to go into it. The man who shoulders his musket conscientiously, may be a faithful christian. The man who cheerfully pays others because he thinks that they are fitter than himself, by nature or education, for such purpose, may also be a good christian. The quakers say, he only who resists not, but trusts to Heaven for protection, is a good christian. “Whatever be a man's religious or political creed, if he be honest and peaceable, uncontroled by selfish interests, prejudice, and bigotry, an observer of the golden rule, and a lover of usefulness—every good christian ought to hail him as a brother, whether his coat be drab or scarlet— whether he has conscientiously taken up arms, or conscientiously refused to take up arms. “The sect of the quakers tacitly declare to all others, you must join, or fight for us. Now, it may happen, and indeed does actually happen, that very many do not approve of the creed and discipline of the quakers; the option then seems to be rather a hard one, and inconsistent with the general principles of justice; for if, in order to avoid war, we go into society, we must violate conscience; if we do not go in, but go out to war, we are reprobated as anti-christians, even when fighting their battles, which they unjustly refuse to do; so that we appear in a dilemma, from which there are no means of release but in breaking down the creed itself. “When we speak of a man trusting in Heaven for protection, we should always think of a protection according to the proper and regular order established by law, not in an imaginary state of things, taking rise in delusions. On this point we have an excellent lesson from Scripture, where Satan, by an affectation of such a trust, desires the Redeemer to cast himself from the pinnacle of the temple; the reply to which should be always present to every christian, for it expressly forbids us thus to tempt the Almighty, by any improper or eccentric departure from the established order even of external or natural things. “The true state of the case is this: when the necessity for war shall cease, then war will cease, and not before; for whilst there are bad men to commit aggressions, the best of men must defend themselves, and by carnal weapons too, if necessary. A contrary doctrine is just as absurd as for a shepherd to go home with his dog, and trust to Providence to protect the sheep, when surrounded by wolves. “But I shall trespass on your patience, and therefore adieu for the present. EDWARD WILLOUGHBY.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVII. THE SAILOR'S STORY. The strange vicissitudes of human fate, Still altering, never in a steady state; Good after ill—and after pain, delight; Alternate, like the scenes of day and night. Then since each man who lives is born to die, And none can boast sincere felicity; With equal mind, what happens let us bear, Nor joy nor grieve too much for things beyond our care. Dryden. In the afternoon our hero visited the wounded son of Neptune, whom he found sitting up in his chamber, and apparently much better. He seized George by the hand as he approached him, and requested that he would grant him half an hour's conversation, if his engagements would permit. This request was very cheerfully complied with. “You see, I am no longer on my beam-ends,” said he, as our hero took a seat by his side; “thanks to the humanity and kindness of those who made the enemy sheer off, and saved me from foundering when overpowered and beaten by superior force. I hope to be refitted and afloat again in a day or two, when I have it in contemplation to evince my gratitude in the only way I can. I owe my life to the humanity of Americans, and though I can make no suitable return to these hospitable individuals in particular, I may serve them by being a benefit to the nation at large. I will therefore enter the American navy, and spend the last drop of my blood in their service. On this subject I wished to have your opinion, as I shall be a fellow-laborer with yourself, though on a different element.” “But do you feel no repugnance to taking up arms against your own country?” “I have no country!” he returned, with a sigh. “You may perhaps conjecture, from my speech, that I was born in Ireland, and so I was; but Ireland has lost its rank among the nations of the earth; it groans in vassalage, and its inhabitants are trodden under foot by British tyranny. Ireland is enslaved, and many Irishmen are compelled to fight the battles of their oppressors—perdition seize the scoundrel who does it from choice! I owe no allegiance to England. If such a tie ever existed, it was cut with the heart-strings of my father's family, who met destruction for daring to express their abhorrence of the tyranny they could not approve. Many long years of misery have I dragged out in the service of England, until an excellent constitution has become broken, and, what is still worse, a noble spirit debased—the manners and sentiments of a gentleman degraded and contaminated by the vulgar servile inmates of an English forecastle! You look surprised, sir.” “I am, indeed. You are no common sailor.” “I was never designed for one. My father, (who had two sons and one daughter) was not rich, but an opulent maternal uncle took the charge of our education, and spared neither pains nor expense to render it complete. My brother graduated at Trinity College, and was studying law under the immortal Emmett, when that inflexible patriot raised his hand and voice in the cause of suffering Ireland. You know the fate of that godlike man, and most of his compatriots—my poor brother's was sealed by the same merciless cut-throats. My uncle fled; and his estate was confiscated. 28* “I was then but fourteen years of age, and just preparing to commence a collegiate course of studies, when these afflicting events plunged us all in ruin, reduced my father to beggary—broke my mother's heart! Young as I was, I felt too indignant at these unmerited sufferings to submit in silence. I spoke my sentiments, and expressed my hatred of the scorpions that had stung me. With an idea of pity worthy of the base-minded parasites of tyranny, they thought to ameliorate the fate which they said my rashness had incurred, and insultingly told me, that `out of a tender regard for my extreme youth, I should only be punished by serving for life in his majesty's navy!' Damnable clemency! Ten thousand times rather would I have died on the scaffold with my brother, in the sacred cause of patriotism, than have served one hour in their floating hells.” “The history of your family,” observed George, “bears a strong resemblance to that of another, whose surviving members are now residing in this country, in the state of Ohio.” “I know not what became of my father, after I was dragged from his arms; it is more than probable that he has followed my mother to the grave. My sister, thank Heaven, was happily married to a man whom prudence kept neutral, though his heart was always with the patriots. I have not heard a syllable from them since my incarceration on board the Majestic, and perhaps never shall. Bowed down with misery, my father was then but the spectre of a man—a walking shadow; and, though offered an asylum in the house of his son-in-law, insisted on supporting himself by giving lessons on the harp, of which he was a perfect master.” “Can there be such a remarkable coincidence?” cried George; “or is it possible that William O'Hara effected his escape from the Macedonian at Norfolk?” It was now the sailor's turn to be surprised; he stared at George some moments, and then replied— “My name is William O'Hara, and I did escape from the Macedonian while that frigate was lying in Hampton Roads, previous to the war.” “What became of your companions?” “Two of them, I have heard, reached the shore in safety; while another, with myself, were picked up by the barge of the revenue-cutter, which, owing to the darkness of the night, ran on us before we perceived her approach. The bargemen cordially congratulated us on our fortunate escape, and, on reaching the cutter, furnished us with dry clothes and snug births until morning, when they set us on shore. Being entirely destitute of money and clothes, we immediately shipped on board the Neptune, which was taking in a cargo for Bordeaux. But not liking the captain, I procured my discharge in France, and went on board a ship just ready to sail for Boston, and here we arrived last week.” “Mysterious Providence!” exclaimed George, “who can fathom or comprehend thy wonderful operations! How many would attribute to chance what is thus brought about by the unseen agents of infinite love and wisdom! Yes, my friend, had it not been for the villainous attack on your life and property (an event which we all so naturally lament) and had not the scene of that outrage been in front of this house, you might never have met a human being to direct you to the arms of a sister—a niece”— “What do you tell me?” “Your brother-in-law, Fleming, with your sister and their daughter, now reside in Ohio, within a mile of my father's house.” “And my father”— “You have supposed him dead—suppose so still; but O fly, the moment you are able, and comfort your poor sister, who mourns at once the loss of father and brother. She believes you to be dead.” “Bountiful Heaven! accept a sailor's thanks, that he has been shipwrecked in the very harbor of happiness! I shall again see the most amiable and affectionate sister that a brother could ever boast. I will set out for Ohio as soon as I am able to travel.” O'Hara now pressed his questions with so much eagerness, that he soon drew from George all the circumstances attending his father's death. “That is the last and most afflicting blow of all,” he exclaimed. “Brother—mother—father —all stabbed by England! But I will not vent my feelings in unavailing complaints and windy words; my arm can reach her; and English blood shall yet bathe the hand that has been hardened in her service. Vengeance will be sanctified by such a cause, and vengeance shall be mine! I will visit my sister, and then—O, my poor father, blind and broken-hearted! the tears you have shed shall be paid, drop for drop, in the vital blood of your savage murderers!” “Be calm, my friend,” interrupted George, in a soothing tone; “revenge will not remedy the evil, and is a passion that should ever be discarded from the human breast.” “Would you be calm, sir, under the load of wrongs I have suffered? Were the savages of your frontier to break into your father's house and lay the whole family bleeding at your feet— then drag you into captivity, and compel you to wear out the years and strength of youth in odious servitude, laboring for the very monsters that had robbed you of liberty, home, family, and all —would you be calm under such circumstances? or would you not rather wreak vengeance on the murderers, were such vengeance in your power?” “I should probably experience a combat in my bosom between feeling and duty,” answered our hero; “but duty would forbid revenge. Never should the sword be drawn from such a motive; and I should not dare to face death in the field of battle with such a demoniac passion in my bosom, as to wish the death of a fellow-creature. I wish to carry with me into the other world as few evil desires as possible, if it were only to disappoint those infernal spirits who would be pleased to see me arrive, freighted with a sufficient load to sink me down among them. No, my friend, we ought to love our enemies, even while duty compels us to be their executioners.” “However I may revere the mild precepts of religion,” replied O'Hara, “I never shall be able to reduce this one to practice. I cannot love the English, and it would be dastardly hypocrisy in me to say that I do. Indeed I cannot conceive how your theory and practice is to be reconciled —you preach forbearance, and yet shoot your enemies!” “A humane surgeon,” replied George, “will perform a dreadful operation with firmness, although his heart may bleed for the pain which duty compels him to inflict. Is it not genuine mercy to destroy a few to save the many from destruction? Is it not mercy to the public to punish the murderer? and cannot this be done without revenge in the breast of him whose duty it is to inflict this punishment? It is an old maxim, (and not the worse for being so) that `it is wise to make choice of the least of two evils.' The degradation of our country, the infringement of her rights, and the enslaving or murdering of her citizens, is a great evil; but we must either choose to submit to this great evil, or else choose the lesser one of drawing the sword, and, by slaying a few, deter the rest from repeating the aggressions. Even though one third of our own countrymen perish in the contest, still if the two thirds are thereby rescued from the vassalage and misery that would otherwise have been entailed on the whole, the sacrifice is proper. Does a parent feel revenge in correcting a vicious son? or does he not rather summon all his firmness to support him in a painful duty, the performance of which may save its object from ruin, and his family from disgrace? Revenge forms no part of a soldier's duty—he can chastise the enemies of his country without it.” “I do not comprehend the distinction,” replied O'Hara; “and we will not disagree about words. Were I convinced that my present feelings towards England were wrong, I would strive to subdue them. Yet”— “But you might slaughter thousands of innocent men,” interrupted George, “without ever drawing blood from a being that has injured you, and thus revenge would never attain its object. Remember that the soldiery and sailors of Great Britain are not accountable for the atrocities of her ministers; and the very men on which you might wreak your vengeance, would, perhaps, have been the first to commiserate your sufferings and denounce the authors.” “Will not the same remark apply with equal force to yourself?” asked the sailor. “In the course of your professional duties, may you not also slaughter innocent men?” “Most undoubtedly,” answered George; “but here lies the difference—to me that would be a most painful duty—whereas, to one whose soul is breathing revenge, it would yield the greatest delight, and make him appear so much like a devil, that the infernals might mistake him for one of their own fraternity, should he chance to leave the world in that horrid state. I have no objection to your fighting the enemy if patriotism carries you to the field; but it is for your own sake, (not the enemy's) that I wish you to discard all feelings of revenge.” “Well—well—” cried O'Hara; “I will fight them, that I am resolved upon, and I promise you to do it from the best motives I can. In the mean time I am grateful for your advice, and will endeavor to believe it correct.” George gave him his hand with a smile, and soon after took his leave, promising to call again the next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVIII. AMERICAN HEROISM. Hail, gallant heroes! bright your glory lives; Nor shall malignant envy dare assail; Receive the laurel which your country gives, And share her triumphs while she tells the tale. Anon. In a few days O'Hara declared himself sufficiently recovered to commence his intended journey, and many were the pens which this declaration put in motion. Few messengers of government were ever charged with more numerous or (in the estimation of those concerned) more important dispatches. George wrote to his father and to Catharine—Amelia did the same. Cushing and Morse both wrote to the major, and Ellen added a postscript to each of their letters. With all my exertions, however, I have not been fortunate enough to procure copies of these important documents; the following brief extract from that written by Morse, being all I have been able to obtain. After granting a general assent to the major's opinion on the subject of defensive war, the writer proceeds to give the outlines of a few important occurrences which could not have yet reached his correspondent's ear; and this he does in the following words, and under the following head— WAR EVENTS. “Another dazzling blaze of glory, my dear sir, encircles the “stripes and stars” of Freedom. On the thirteenth of October, the sloop of war Wasp, commanded by captain Jones, sailed from the Delaware, and on the eighteenth of the same month, after a long and heavy gale, she fell in with a number of strongly armed merchantmen, under convoy of his Britannic majesty's sloop of war Frolic, which was captured by the Wasp, after a very desperate and sanguinary conflict of forty-three minutes. “The first lieutenant on board the Wasp, whose name is Biddle, is a young gentleman to whom captain Jones has been long attached by the strong tie of friendship, arising from sympathy of taste, profession, and valor. They served together in the Mediterranean, and for twenty tedious months were fellow-captives in the dungeons of Tripoli. They are now rewarded with never-fading wreaths of fame. In four or five minutes after the commencement of the action, the maintopmast of the Wasp was shot away, and in falling, with the yard attached to it, across the foretopsail braces, rendered her head sails totally unmanageable during the rest of the action. In two or three minutes more her gaft and mizen-top-gallant-sail fell before the fire of the enemy, but still she continued the contest with unabated ardor. The sea was so rough that the muzzles of their guns were frequently in the water. At length the Wasp shot ahead of her opponent, raked her and then resumed her position on her larboard bow. In a few minutes they closed with a most severe concussion, when the jib-boom of the enemy crossed the deck of the Wasp, directly above the heads of Jones and Biddle, who were at that moment standing together near the capstan. The Frolic now lay so fair for raking, that they decided to give her a closing broadside, and then 29 board. In loading for this broadside, the two vessels were so near each other, that the rammers of the American guns were pushed against the Frolic's bows. Two of the Wasp's guns entered the enemy's bow ports, and swept the whole length of her deck. “American valor is confined to no rank. A common sailor of the Wasp, called Jack Lang, (a native of New-Brunswick, in the state of New-Jersey, who had been once impressed by a British man of war) at this moment mounted a gun, and, with a cutlass in his hand, sprang upon the Frolic's bowsprit. Jones called to him to desist, as he wished to give the enemy another broadside; but the gallant tar's impetuosity could not be restrained, and the whole crew were panting to follow him. Unwilling to check such laudable ardor and enthusiasm as his men evinced, Jones consented to their wishes. Biddle mounted on the hammock-cloth, and the crew followed; but his feet got entangled in the rigging of the enemy's bowsprit, and midshipman Baker, in his ardor to get on board, laying hold of his coat, Biddle fell backwards on the deck of the Wasp. He sprang up, and as the next swell of the sea brought the Frolic nearer, he got on her bowsprit, passed Lang and another American seaman on her forecastle, and was astonished to find not a single man alive on the Frolic's deck, except the seaman at the wheel, and three officers. The deck was slippery with blood, and strewed with the bodies and limbs of the dead. As he approached the officers, on the quarter deck, they threw down their swords, making at the same time an inclination of the body indicating their surrender. At this moment the colors were still flying, and were now hauled down by Biddle, in exactly forty-three minutes from firing the first broadside. “The Frolic's deck, and indeed every part of her, presented a most shocking spectacle; the birth-deck, particularly, was crowded with dead, and wounded, and dying; there being but a small proportion of her crew who had escaped. Jones instantly sent on board his surgeon's mate, and Biddle directed all the purser's blankets and slops to be brought up for the use of the wounded; every exertion that humanity could dictate, was made to alleviate their sufferings. “It now appeared that the Frolic was superior in force to the Wasp, by exactly four twelve pounders; her sails, masts and rigging, suffered less than those of the Wasp; consequently the enemy possessed superior advantages in manœuvring, and his loss compared to ours, was on his own estimate more than six to one killed, and nearly twelve to one wounded. The exact number of the enemy's killed and wounded could not be ascertained; but it is not less than thirty killed and fifty wounded. The commander, captain Whinyates, and his second lieutenant, were wounded, and two other officers were killed. The Wasp had five men killed, and five slightly wounded. Soon after taking possession of the prize, both her masts fell by the board, covering the mangled bodies on deck, rendering the most horrid confusion still “worse confounded,” and she lay a complete wreck, exposed to the tossings of the turbulent billows. “All hands were now employed in clearing the deck, burying the dead, and taking care of the wounded, when Jones sent orders to Biddle to steer for Charleston, or any southern port of the United States; and as there was a suspicious sail to windward, the Wasp would continue her cruise. The ships then parted, and the supsicious sail approached very fast. It proved to be the Poictiers, of seventy-four guns, commanded by captain Beresford; and as the situation of both vessels precluded every hope of escape or resistance, both were surrendered and sent into Bermuda.[1] [1] See Analetic Magazine and Port Folio. “Our cousin Aylwin is again on the ocean, in the Constitution, but not under Hull, that hero having been appointed to succeed Chauncey in the command of the port and harbor of New-York. Bainbridge now commands the Constitution, and he sailed on the twenty-sixth day of last month. That frigate has already made a lasting impression on the minds of Englishmen, and this cruise may perhaps produce a second edition. “Hull `bears his blushing honors thick upon him;' wherever he goes, rich testimonials of public approbation are heaped upon him in the most splendid profusion. In this town he was honored with a public dinner, at which nearly six hundred of the most respectable gentlemen of both political parties united to pay a tribute of gratitude and respect to American valor and skill. In New-York, a fund has been raised for the purpose of purchasing superb swords, to be presented to captain Hull and the officers under his command. The corporation of New-York have also presented him with the freedom of that city, in a gold box, with an appropiate inscription; and as an additional tribute of respect, have requested the captain to favor them with a sitting for his portrait, to be deposited in the Picture-Gallery of the City-Hall. In Philadelphia, at a general meeting of the citizens, it was resolved, that a piece of plate of the most elegant workmanship, with appropriate emblems, devices and inscriptions, be presented to captain Hull, and that a like piece of plate be presented to lieutenant Morris, in the name of the citizens of Philadelphia, as a testimony of esteem and respect for their gallant conduct; and also, that such other tokens of esteem be presented to the other officers and crew of the Constitution, as a committee appointed for that purpose might deem proper. “Hull, however, is only one bright star in a constellation of heroes about to rise in the west, to the astonishment of all the eastern world. Indeed, sir, I feel confident that the present contest will produce as many conspicuous naval heroes as we have vessels afloat, and elecit flashes of heroism from men of all ranks, unequalled for brilliancy in the history of the world. Aylwin assured me, that in the heat of the action with the Guerriere, one of the crew of the Constitution, perceiving that the flag at the foretopmast head had been shot away, went up and lashed it in such a manner as to make it impossible for a shot to take it away without taking the mast with it. I understand that the Secretary of the Navy intends taking suitable notice of this heroic act. “Among the heroes engaged in this brilliant event, with whom I have the honor of being acquainted, is lieutenant Morris, who received a shot through his body, and for some time was not expected to recover. He has since received the promotion which his courage and good conduct 29* so eminently deserve, and has been appointed to command the frigate Adams, now fitting at Washington. Like most of our naval officers, he made his debut on the Mediterranean station, where he served several years. By his correct conduct, his gentlemanlike demeanor, and his unremitted attention to his duty, he obtained the confidence of all the commanders with whom he sailed, and the universal esteem of his brother officers.— Among the chosen few, selected by lieutenant (now commodore) Decatur, to accompany him in his gallant expedition to burn the Philadelphia frigate, midshipman Morris was one. He followed lieutenant Decatur in boarding the ship, and during the conducting of that masterly achievement, manifested many proofs of the dauntless bravery and intrepid spirit which he is well known to possess. “Lieutenant-colonel Miller, of the United States army, who commanded the gallant fourth regiment in the west, has been exchanged for captain Dacres of the Guerriere. The colonel is to join the sixth infantry, commanded by colonel Simonds, on the Canada frontier. “Admiral sir J. B. Warren arrived at Halifax on the twenty-seventh September, on board the San Domingo, of seventy-four guns, in company with the Poictiers of seventy-four guns, and an armed brig. The admiral expressed much surprise to learn that the United States was still continuing the war. It was generally believed in England, that the repeal of the Orders in Council would immediately produce a cessation of hostilities. The admiral is not clothed with powers to treat with the American government. “Captain Porter has sailed on another cruise, which will probably be long and hazardous, as his cruising ground is said to extend along the whole coast of South America, perhaps into the Pacific ocean. He commands a brave crew of American tars, and is himself a most daring and enterprising officer, as you will perceive from the following facts. He commenced his naval career on board the Constellation, captain Truxton, during the short contest we had with France. In the action with the French frigate the Insurgent, Porter was stationed in the foretop, and distinguished himself by his good conduct. Want of friends prevented his promotion at that time; and to his merit alone he was finally indebted for a commission. He afterwards signalized himself in several gallant little affairs on the West-India station, and also in the Mediterranean, where he was first lieutenant of the Enterprise, captain Stewart. In this cruise they encountered a Tripolitan corsair of very superior force; a severe battle ensued, in which the enemy suffered great slaughter, and was compelled to surrender, while the Americans received but little injury. In this brilliant action Porter acquired much reputation from the conspicuous part he acted. In another engagement with the enemy, in the harbor of old Tripoli, where he was sent to destroy some vessels laden with wheat, he acquired fresh laurels, and received a musket ball through his left thigh. “Shortly after recovering from his wound, he was transposed to the Philadelphia, commanded by Bainbridge, and was made a captive with the whole crew in the harbor of Tripoli, the frigate having grounded and could not be got off. “When peace was at length made, the captives were restored from their long and dismal confinement, and Porter was soon after appointed to command the Enterprise. While at anchor in the port of Malta, an English sailor came along side, and insulted the officers and crew by very abusive language; Porter overhearing him, ordered a boatswain's mate to seize him, and give him a flogging at the gangway; which order was promptly obeyed. The governor of Malta, affected to consider this a daring outrage, and gave orders that the forts should not permit the Enterprise to depart. No sooner was Porter informed of it, than he got his vessel ready for action, weighed anchor, and with lighted matches, and every man at his station, with the avowed determination of firing upon the town if attacked, sailed between the silent batteries, and departed unmolested. “Shortly after this occurrence, in passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, he was attacked by twelve Spanish gun-boats, who either mistook, or pretended to mistake his vessel for a British brig. The calmness of the weather, the weight of their metal, and the acknowledged accuracy of their aim, made the odds greatly against him. As soon, however, as he was able to near them, they were assailed with such rapid and well-directed vollies, as quickly compelled them to sheer off. This affair took place in sight of Gibraltar, and in presence of several ships of the British navy; it was, therefore, a matter of notoriety, and spoken of in terms of the highest applause. “Such is the man who has now gone to shake the southern hemisphere with Freedom's awful thun der. Can he do otherwise than maintain the honor of our flag, and reap laurels for himself? He has already acquired the honor of taking the first prize in the present war, and sent the first British flag to the seat of government. “The British packet Swallow, of eighteen guns, (bound from Jamaica to Falmouth, with the mail and specie to the amount of two hundred and sixty thousand dollars) has arrived at Baltimore, a prize to commodore Rodgers. The specie was taken on board the President. “Of transactions on the Niagara, I presume you possess later accounts than I have seen. The invasion of Canada, from that quarter, I believe, remains in status quo, since the battle of Queenston. Van Rensselaer has resigned his command to Smyth, who has issued a very pompous address to the men of New-York, inviting them to join his standard, and promising to lead them to conquest and glory. There has been some skirmishing on the northern frontier, and several successful little incursions into the enemy's territory, particularly by the enterprising Forsyth, whose affair at Gananoque, in Leeds, you are undoubtedly acquainted with, and also the more recent success of the gallant major Young at St. Regis.[2] [2] Captain Forsyth, with seventy riflemen, entered the village of Gananoque, a little before sunrise, on the twenty-first of September, and, after a warm contest with one hundred and forty-five regulars, they compelled the enemy to fly, took a number of prisoners, sixty stand of arms, two barrels of fixed ammunition, one barrel of powder, one barrel of flints, and several other articles; with which they returned, (after setting fire to his majesty's store-house) with the loss of only one man, while the enemy had above a dozen killed, and many wounded. Major Young crossed the lines on the twenty-first of October, and entered the village of St. Regis early the next morning, where, after a short contest, in which five of the enemy were killed, Young succeeded in taking forty prisoners, with their arms, equipments, etc. one stand of colors, and two batteaux, without an American being hurt. “General Brown has given a practical comment on the subject of self-defence. Ogdensburgh, I understand, has been bombarded three times, and most gallantly defended by that friend of liberty. “In your next, I shall expect some information from the southwest, and your opinion of the present situation of that frontier, which from all the intelligence that has reached us, appears to be a very critical one. Both Spaniards and Indians have assumed a menacing attitude; and many dreadful outrages have been committed. The Creeks were to hold a grand Council on the twenty-second of October, to which they invited the Choctaws, the Chickasaws and the Cherokees. It is possible that the elation produced by Indian successes in the north, may vanquish the wavering, and arm the cowardly with a momentary courage. If so, the times will be dreadful to the settlements on the waters of the Mobile, which lie insulated in the midst of an extensive wilderness, between Georgia and the Mississippi, and between Florida and the state of Tennessee. News from the northern confederacy of the surrender of Hull, reached the Creek nation by Indian expresses, almost as soon as it was carried by the American mail, and no doubt had considerable influence on the minds of the Indians at the general council. “By an act of Congress of the United States, passed on the twenty-ninth of May last, the town of Mobile is declared to be a part of the Mississippi territory, to be governed by the laws thereof, and by the laws and ordinances of the United States relating thereto. But the people of Mobile, though generally anxious to become American citizens, do not yet feel a conviction that it is the intention of our government to make them such; and there is some reason to apprehend that, unless this part of the Mississippi territory be speedily in the occupancy of an American force, it will not be taken without a bloody struggle. Adieu.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIX. THE INTERVIEW. She fed within her veins a flame unseen: The hero's valor, acts, and worth, inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Dryden's Virg. On the day after our hero's arrival at Boston, he reported himself to the war department by letter, and wrote to several of his friends in Washington. In answer to one of these private cpistles, he received a most pressing invitation to make a visit to the seat of government, with which he determined to comply; and accordingly commenced his journey for that city on Friday the twentieth day of November. The Sunday following he passed with his old acquaintances in Newport. Perry was not there, having been several months before promoted to the rank of master and commander, and ordered to the command of the flotilla of gun-boats stationed at the harbor of New-York, in which duty he was then engaged. “It perhaps seldom happens that an officer is first recommended to the notice and favorable regards of his government by his misfortunes. Such, however, had been the case with Perry; a very serious disaster which had befallen him (subsequent to his short acquaintance with our hero) had drawn from the secretary of the navy a complimentary letter, not only acquitting him of all blame, but highly applauding the judgment, intrepidity, and perseverance he had displayed on the unfortunate and trying occasion, the particulars of which are these—He had received orders to survey the harbor of Newport, repair to New-London, and from thence survey all the intermediate coast. In the execution of this duty, he sailed from Newport late in the evening, with an easterly wind accompanied by a fog. In the morning he found himself enveloped in a thick mist, with a considerable swell going. In this situation, without any possibility of ascertaining where he was, the pilot not being sufficiently acquaintanted with the soundings, the vessel was carried on a reef, and went to pieces. On this occasion Perry gave proofs of a most admirable coolness and presence of mind. He used every precaution to save the guns and property, and was in a great measure successful. He got off all the crew in perfect safety, and was himself the last to leave the wreck. His conduct in respect to this disaster underwent examination by a court of inquiry, at his own request, by which he was acquitted with the most honorable testimonials of their approbation. From that hour he had become a favorite in the navy department, and had probably thus laid the foundation of future celebrity in his misfortunes. A letter on this subject from the navy department to commodore Rodgers, contained the following sentences: “Having attentively examined the proceedings of the court, I derive much satisfaction from perceiving that it is unnecessary to institute any further proceedings in the case. With respect to lieutenant Perry, I can only say, that my confidence in him has not been in any degree diminished by his conduct on this occasion. The loss of the Revenge appears to be justly chargeable to the pilot. This accident will no doubt present to lieutenant Perry considerations that may be useful to him in future command. An officer, just to himself, will not be depressed by defeat or misfortune; but will be stimulated by either cause to greater exertion. “If there should be any situation in the squadron, to which you can appoint lieutenant Perry, that may be consistent with his just pretensions, and not interfere with the rights of others, you will appoint him to it; if not, he is to be furloughed, waiting the further orders from this department.” On Monday, George departed for New-York, where he arrived on the morning of the twenty-fifth, amidst the ringing of bells and firing of cannon, in celebration of the day on which the British troops evacuated the city, after the revolutionary war. On the summit of every public edifice, and on the masts of every vessel in the harbor, Freedom's bright streaming banners were gaily displayed, flashing in the sun-beam as they fluttered in the blast. Martial music was heard in all directions; the clattering hoofs of the prancing cavalry responded to the notes of the soul 30 inspiring bugle; and numerous corps of volunteers, regulars, and militia, were paraded in the public squares. Our hero instantly forgot the fatigues of a long and rapid journey, (during which he had been assailed by a most furious storm, that had scattered trees, chimneys and fences in his road[3] [3] The destructive storm which occurred on Tuesday morning, November 24, 1812, is probably well remembered. Many vessels were shipwrecked in the Sound, and a church-steeple in Orange county was blown down. ) and catching the general glow of patriotic enthusiasm that pervaded the city, entered at once into the festive enjoyments of the occasion. About mid-day the troops had formed a line, and were reviewed by his excellency the governor, and generals Armstrong and Morton. The third regiment of the state artillery were then inducted into the fortress which they were destined to garrison,† † Fort Gansevoort. where a national salute was fired. A sumptuous dinner had been prepared for the officers of this beautiful regiment, at Mechanic Hall, and among the invited guests were the governor, generals Armstrong and Morton, adjutant-general Paulding, and several United States officers of inferior grade, of whom ensign Willoughby was one. After the cloth was removed, patriotic toasts were mutually pledged in flowing bumpers, interspersed with odes, songs, and national airs by an excellent band of musicians. Among the sentiments given on this occasion, the following was peculiarly grateful to more than one officer present: “Our brave brethren in arms who so nobly sustained the unequal contest at Queenston.” It was received by the company with rapturous acclamations, which were answered from the orchestra in the lofty strains of a full martial chorus. On the approach of evening the company began to retire, and our hero accompanied several officers to the theatre, which was brilliantly illuminated in honor of the anniversary. He entered amid a gay group of plumes and epaulets, and took a seat in the second row of boxes, directly opposite the stage. The house, which was rapidly filling when they entered, soon became crowded, and (as usual on the evening of a holiday) extremely noisy. The curtain drew up, and a short but very pleasing prelude was performed, entitled “All in Good Humor,” and he must have been indeed a most surly cynic who could witness its representation without being charmed into the feeling which the title expresses. The whole house appeared in the best of humors. When the curtain fell at the conclusion of the prelude, master Whale, better known as the infant vestris, performed a naval hornpipe, in a style that drew reiterated peals of approbation from the admiring audience. The play which succeeded was the celebrated “Point of Honor, or School for Soldiers,” and many were the sympathetic tears which silently applauded the performance. When the amiable and unfortunate Durimel appeared on the stage as a convicted deserter led to the place of execution; when blind-folded he kneeled to meet his fate; and when the word to fire was given by his own father, who in the same instant threw himself before his son, to receive the fire and die with him, convulsive sobs could be distinctly heard in every direction. The command to fire was instantaneously succeeded by the word “hold!” thundered in the voice of an officer who rushed in with a reprieve, and with his sword struck up the levelled muskets before a trigger could be pressed. The effect on the audience was electrical, and just such as the reality of such a scene might be supposed to produce. The soft contagion ran through every bosom, and appeared in every eye, whether in gallery, pit, or boxes. A short interlude then followed, entitled “Huzza for the Constitution,” written by a citizen of New-York in honor of Hull's victory over the Guerriere. The scene represented the lower end of Broadway, Bowling-Green and Battery, and in the distance appeared the forts, and entrance to the harbor. A countryman entered, who, in a short soliloquy on the political relations of his country, was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of a sailor in whom he recognised his own son. After many embraces and noisy congratulations on the happiness of the meeting, Jack, (who it seemed belonged on board the Constitution) proceeded to give his father an account of the engagement, in a style truly technical and animated. The old man appeared highly delighted with his son's unpolished relation, and so perhaps did every person in the house. The afterpiece of Timour the Tartar concluded the evening's entertainments, and that character was supported in a most excellent style by Mr. Simpson. Although our hero never entered the theatre for any other purpose than that of seeing and enjoying the performance, he was still not insensible to the attractions of a splendid auditory; and, between the acts, was always agreeably employed in surveying the “human face divine,” or in conversing with any accessible being around him, male or female. On the present occasion his curiosity had been considerably excited by the appearance of a lady in the adjoining box, whose eyes were continually directed to himself. Two or three times, in the course of the evening, he changed his position, in order to ascertain whether his person was or was not the subject of such uninterrupted scrutiny. Being at length convinced that this was the case, he took the earliest opportunity of crowding to that side of the box which adjoined hers, where he was in fact literally seated by the side of the fair stranger. He now attempted to draw her into conversation: determined, if possible, to discover the motive which could induce her to honor him with such particular notice. As soon, however, as she perceived him approach, she suddenly withdrew her eyes, and pulling a veil over her face, remained totally silent to all our hero's observations, nor even regarded him with a look. When the curtain fell on the last scene of the play, an elderly gentleman, who sat by her side, arose, and whispering something in her ear to which she bowed assent, left the box. She followed him with her eyes until he entered the lobby, then turning to our hero, she uttered in a low voice—“For Heaven's sake, Mr. Willoughby, speak no more to me here; I will explain the reason if you will call to-morrow morning at No. — William-street. Fail not for the world, for I have a thousand things of the utmost importance to communicate. At eleven o'clock precisely I shall expect you.” 30* Although this address convinced George that he had not been squandering so many words on a stranger, he was still ignorant of her name and quality. He could not recollect when, or where, but was sure he had somewhere before met the gaze of the sharp black eye which was now fixed on his. The rest of her features were concealed by her veil. “You must not fail to come,” added she with great earnestness, but in the same low tone. “Who shall I”—enquire for? he would have said, but she interrupted him, and in a hurried, embarrassed manner, whispered—“Hush! say not another word—I beg of you—I command you! Only remember to-morrow, at eleven.” Our hero was silent, and in a moment the elderly gentleman returned to her side, and presented her with some fruit, which she accepted. The curiosity of George was on tip-toe, but having been forbidden to speak, there was no way of gratifying it. But why his conversation with an acquaintance should depend on the exit or entrance of a third person, he could not conceive— strangers they could not be, because she had addressed him by his name, and requested an interview. As they were passing through the crowded lobby to leave the house, George purposely kept close to her right side; the elderly gentleman, under whose protection she evidently moved, retaining his position on the left. But her face being still enveloped in her veil, our hero gained nothing by the intrusion but an ardent pressure of the hand, which was probably intended to remind him of his engagement the next day, and to which he answered in the same silent language—(plain as a hand could speak)—“I shall not forget it.” The lady, with her conductor, entered a coach at the door, and our hero repaired to his lodgings at the City-Hotel, where he forgot himself, the world, and his engagement, until eight o'clock the next morning. The last stroke of eleven had not resounded from St. Paul's, as George knocked at the door to which he had been invited. He was received by a female servant, who ushered him into the parlor, and left him with observing that her mistress would be ready to receive him in a few minutes. While he was amusing himself in surveying some beautiful paintings with which the walls of the room were decorated, the messenger returned, and requested him to walk up stairs. He immediately complied, and followed his fair conductor to a corresponding room in the second story, where, on a sofa near the fire, sat the object of his visit, apparently absorbed in grief. As her visitor approached, she arose, and removing a handkerchief from her eyes, displayed a lovely countenance, glowing with blushes and bathed in tears, through which a most fascinating smile shone like the sun in an April shower. She gave him her hand, and our hero exclaimed with unaffected surprise—“Is it possible!—Sophia Palmer?” “And did you not know me last evening?” asked she with a sigh; “You knew that I was in this city?” “Indeed, I did not. The shortness of my stay in Boston prevented my learning the situation of half my friends. You are here on a visit. I presume.” “Did you not hear a single word of me?” inquired she, with great earnestness. “Was my name never mentioned in your hearing?” “It was not, Sophia, if I can trust my recollection.” “And you made no inquiries—forgetting, I suppose, that there was such a being in existence. But come,”—added she in a more cheerful tone— “I forgive you; take a seat here by my side; we have but one hour to converse, and I have a hundred thousand things to say—and yet—I know not how to begin.” For a few moments both were silent; at length, without raising her eyes, she asked if he had forgotten the masquerade. “I shall never forget it,” he exclaimed, thinking of the Mysterious Chief. “You have forgotten the little Gipsey? but— she has never forgotten—the Minstrel.” George had forgotten the little Gipsey; but the character now recurred to his mind with all the attending circumstances. “And was it, then, the lovely Sophia who so kindly told my fortune?” “And whom you so unkindly refused to meet in the pavilion. O George! George!—do not despise me—I am—indeed, I am very, very unhappy —wretched—miserable!” Here she was again silent, with her face concealed in her handkerchief, and reclined on the arm of the sofa. “I am surprised and shocked to hear it,” replied George. “But if you think me worthy of your confidence, unfold to me the cause of your grief; and, if it lies within the compass of my poor ability to alleviate your sufferings, I swear to do it.” She raised her head, and gazing at him through her tears, replied— “O, you will break your oath.” George felt hurt at an insinuation that implied a doubt of his friendship, or his sincerity; he therefore ardently exclaimed— “Never! So help me God!” “It is in your power to afford me relief—to wipe all these tears from my cheeks, and make this poor heart dance in my bosom for joy. It is in your power, but you will never do it; you alone can save me, and yet I shall be lost!” As she uttered this she unconsciously leaned towards the embarrassed George; her right hand was on his arm, and her left pressed to her own heart. Her look was tender and supplicating, and her whole frame extremely agitated. Our hero became apprehensive that she would fall from the seat, and therefore supported her with his arm; when she gently, and almost imperceptibly, slid to his bosom, and there hid her face, moistening his ruffles with her tears, while her arm was thrown over his shoulder. He could distinctly feel the violent throbs of her heart against his breast, and the lengthened throes of her bosom laboring with half-suppressed sobs. His situation was becoming more embarrassing, but he knew not how to change it. At length she spake— “Are you aware of the full extent of your oath?” “Tell me the nature of your afflictions. What has made you unhappy?” “Love.” “Love! How can love be productive of misery? How can love make Sophia unhappy?” “If you can ask such a question,” said she, starting suddenly from his bosom, “I have no hope from your oath. Appeal to your own heart —but, did you ever love?” George was silent; but his blushes answered in the affirmative. Sophia continued— “If ever you are doomed to love without hope, as I have done—as I now do—you will then, and not till then, know how to feel for—how to pity me. Whole nights of sleepless agony have I passed since last we met, steeping my pillow in tears, or breathing my sighs to the midnight moon —almost cursing the day that I was born. Many a summer hour have I spent in the deepest recesses of a wood, there to weep unseen, and tell my sorrows to the listening trees; catching the mere shadow of consolation in hearing the distant echoes repeat a name which only in such profound solitude I would venture to pronounce— the name of the dear youth whose image will for ever dwell in this afflicted breast. But why should I attempt to describe all I have suffered? —why compel you to share sorrows which nothing can remove? You cannot—you will not impart comfort to my heart; but it will soon break with its own griefs, and then poor Sophia will find peace in the grave!” “What would you have me do, Sophia?” asked the compassionate George, now almost melted into tears—his tone and aspect expressive of the tenderest pity. “How can I afford you comfort? Shall I intercede with the object of your affections, and endeavor to kindle in his bosom a reciprocal passion?” “Do so, and I will for ever bless you. This is what you can do, and this you are bound by an oath to perform.” “Who is he? I am ready and eager to fulfil the engagement. Where is he?” “In my arms,” exclaimed she, throwing herself on his bosom, and encircling him in a most tender embrace. “Though you may despise me for the confession—though you may spurn me from you with contempt—yet still will I cling to you thus, until I have discharged a load from my heart which will otherwise burst it. It is yourself—and you only that I love with the most unbounded affection. It is for you that I have watched, and prayed, and wept. It is your image alone that fills my bosom, and lives there night and day. In your arms alone can I hope to find happiness—here is paradise—the only heaven I covet. All without is misery—despair—the only hell I deprecate.” “Damnable strumpet!” exclaimed a voice of thunder, and in the same instant Sophia was dragged by the hair from our hero's arms, who started on his feet, and recognised the elderly gentleman whom he had seen at the play. With a blow that covered her lovely face with blood, he struck the shrieking Sophia to the floor, and as George was darting to her assistance, seized him by the collar. Our hero dashed away his hand, and pushing him ungently aside, flew to the prostrate fair, whom he tenderly raised in his arms, and placed on the sofa, bleeding and insensible; then turning to the enraged assailant, demanded, in rather a haughty tone, by what authority he thus presumed to ill-treat a lady who was mistress of her own actions. “Indeed!” exclaimed the German, (for such his accent declared him to be) “But I find she has deceived you, as well as all the rest of her friends. I am her husband, sir, and know how to chastise any scoundrel who dares intrude on a husband's rights.” The first part of this address almost petrified George with astonishment; but the concluding words kindled in his bosom a different sentiment, which blazed in lightning from his indignant eye, as he exclaimed— “You dare not apply that epithet to me, sir; nor implicate me in the false aspersion.” “I dare—but do not,” replied the German, in a lower tone. “You forget, sir, how much appearances are against you. But I am more just— I have been (though unintentionally on my part) an invisible auditor of this accursed tete-a-tete, and acquit you of any intentions hostile to my honor. That traitress alone is guilty—and severely shall she atone for it.” “Unhappy—lost Sophia!” exclaimed George, turning towards the beautiful insensible; “into what an abyss of misery has your indiscretion plunged you! How will your worthy parents— your amiable sister, sustain the affliction which a knowledge of this event would entail upon them! Let me entreat you, sir, to forget this aberration of her youthful heart, and by your generous forbearance make it again yours. Your forgiveness will save—your severity lose her for ever.” “Your compassion is misplaced, sir, and you plead in vain. Have I not just heard her declare that her heart was wholly yours, and you ask her husband to win it by forgiveness! I cannot at present command my feelings—oblige me by withdrawing.” “Not till you promise”— “Beware, sir,” interrupted the enraged husband, “how you tempt me to retract my opinion of your own honor.” “At least,” replied George, “suffer her to receive medical assistance. She is bleeding from the effects of your resentment—she may never recover---You would not be her executioner? Comply, for your own sake, with my request, and I take my leave.” “Her health shall be attended to, and when you wish to see me, send your address. Adieu! With feelings which it would be difficult to describe, our hero proceeded to his lodgings. He was unhappy without being guilty; a very common case in this wicked world, where happiness does not altogether depend upon the rectitude of our own conduct. Where, then, is the consolation? It follows---How much more unhappy would George have been, had he been guilty! After a little reflection, he felt the full force of the sentiment, and regained his composure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">31 CHAPTER XL. FURTHER PARTICULARS. Force, and the will of our imperious rulers, May bind two bodies in one wretched chain; But minds will still look back to their own choice. So the poor captive, in a foreign realm, Stands on the shore and sends his wishes back To the dear native land from whence he came. Rowe's Fair Pen. When George Willoughby left Boston with his father, in December, one thousand eight hundred and eleven,[4] [4] See vol. i. p. 164. he carried with him the unguarded heart of Sophia Palmer, but was altogether unconscious of the prize. Sophia drooped in despondency, without communicating the cause of her unhappiness. All the effects of her unfortunate passion were accurately described by herself in the foregoing chapter. Her parents were alarmed at the change in the disposition of their youngest daughter, but had no suspicion of the real cause. They attributed it to the same constitutional languor which appeared to affect her sister, and applied physical remedies. On the following summer their anxious father took them both to Ballston, in the state of New-York, to try the efficacy of the waters; but, after continuing there a month, perceived no change for the better in the health of his darling girls. It was here that he received a private account of the battle of Maguago, in which ensign Willoughby was reported to have been slain. The alarming effects which this intelligence produced on the mind of Sophia betrayed the secret wound which was rankling in her bosom. Previous to this, a rich German, with whom they became acquainted at the springs, had declared himself her admirer. His name was Kreutzer; he was a merchant of some eminence in the city of New-York, and though old enough to be the father of Sophia, found a powerful advocate for his suit in her avaricious parent. Sophia, however, continued peremptory in rejecting the addresses of such a lover, while she could cherish a hope connected with the object of her ardent attachment. But all hope was annihilated by the account of his death; and, incessantly harassed by the importunities of the lover, the expostulations of her father, and the intreaties of all her friends, spiritless and almost broken-hearted, she at length yielded a reluctant consent to become the wife of Kreutzer, who led her, a passive victim, to the hymenial altar. A few weeks of a kind of negative enjoyment succeeded this legal prostitution, when a letter from Boston undeceived her with respect to the death of George Willoughby, and plunged her at once into a gulf of wretchedness and despair. Filled with unavailing regret for the precipitancy of the step she had been induced to take, she grew unguarded in giving utterance to her feelings, and thus at once embittered the felicity of her doating husband, and rendered her own life completely miserable. Acquainted with the world, and well versed in the study of human nature, Kreutzer soon perceived sufficient grounds for believing that he had gained a hand without a heart. A spirit of jealousy succeeded, and many were the anxious hours he passed in watching the movements of his wife, while she believed him to be engaged abroad. His suspicions, however, were rapidly declining for want of any food that could yield them support, when she unfortunately saw the object of all her thoughts at the theatre. The passion which had been smothering in her bosom without a breath of hope to revive it, now kindled like lightning to an irresistible blaze, fed by a whirlwind of unhallowed wishes. The few seeds of virtue that had been scattered on the surface of her uncultivated mind, were now swept like chalf before the tempest of passion, and totally disappeared. Sophia was resolved to fall. In forming this fatal resolution, she displayed some symptoms of embarrassment that did not escape the notice of her husband. These, with some subsequent “trifles, light as air,” induced him to resort to an old, and hitherto unsuccessful plan. He was under a previous engagement to visit a sick friend at Westchester, on the following day, and at ten o'clock took leave of his wife for that purpose. Instead, however, of leaving the house, he ascended, unperceived, to his study, adjoining the apartment to which Sophia was confined under the plea of indisposition. With all that followed the reader is acquainted. Our hero passed the remainder of the day in solitude and uneasiness. At one moment he condemned theatrical establishments as the primary cause of all human misery; in the next he upbraided himself for acquiescing in so mysterious an assignation. A train of calm reflection, however, soon convinced him that neither the theatre nor himself were in fault; that the lovely, the frail Sophia alone was culpable, and she alone deserved to suffer. But was her fault commensurate with its punishment? Was not her crime involuntary? Could she help loving him? George pitied, but could not excuse the unfortunate fair one whose crime consisted not in loving him, but in deceiving her husband and harboring thoughts in her bosom inimical to virtue and his honor; in passively yielding to an enemy, instead of resisting and opposing him. There is no sin in being tempted, for the Saviour of the world was “tempted at all points as we are,” and was yet without iniquity; the sin consists in yielding to, instead of opposing, the passion which tempts us. Sophia could and ought to have avoided instead of seeking an interview so hostile to her peace—so hazardous to her honor. She had plighted her nuptial faith in the presence of Heaven, and if this had been done while she knew that her heart was not in her disposal, the sacrifice of feeling to duty was the least atonement she could make for the crime. “It was a grievous fault, and grievously Sophia has answered it.” Such were the reflections which naturally arose in the mind of George, and warranted him in acquitting both himself and the theatre of all blame respecting the event he lamented. He felt the liveliest gratitude to Heaven for his own “deliverance from evil”—his rescue from a temptation that had convinced him of the frailty of his nature. He had been providentially snatched from the brink of a precipice to which he had been unwittingly and innocently drawn, and on the dizzy verge of which he had actually tottered. Grateful for the interposition to which he owed his safety, and well aware that his interference 31* would not tend to soften the rigor of Sophia's fate, he resolved to prosecute his journey, and leave the event to Providence. His anxiety, however, to ascertain the state of her health, would not permit him to leave the city without first seeking another interview with her husband; and he accordingly, on the third day, dispatched a servant of the Hotel with a letter containing his address, and a request that Kreutzer would favor him with a few minutes conversation at his lodgings. But the messenger returned without delivering the note, stating that the house was shut up, and the family removed to the country. After spending the whole day in fruitless inquiries respecting the place of their destination, he relinquished the pursuit, and on the following morning departed for Washington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLI. A NAVAL BALL. Thy birth, Columbia, sons so brave, Thy waters, forests, all proclaim Thy destin'd course is o'er the wave, And ocean is thy “field of fame.” Anon. Among the naval heroes who were now at the seat of government, were Hull, Morris, and Stewart; the latter commanding the Constellation, which had been undergoing repairs at the navy yard, and was nearly ready for sea. Although Stewart had not yet signalized himself in the war with England, he was not destitute of naval renown. During the rupture with France he had distinguished himself in several little brilliant affairs on the West-India station, while commanding the Enterprise, a schooner of twelve guns. When the American government found it necessary to chastise the insolence of the Tripolitans, the Mediterranean became a theatre of naval enterprise. Stewart commanded the Syren in Preble's squadron, and performed many valuable and hazardous services for his country. During the blockade of Tripoli, he captured a Maltese brig of twelve guns, and a Greek ship, for attempting to enter the harbor; and afterwards led the attack against two of the enemy's forts, westward of the town, which were silenced and completely demolished, without the loss of a single American. In the first bombardment of Tripoli, on the third day of August, one thousand eight hundred and four, Stewart rendered himself conspicuous by his heroic conduct. It was on the occasion of this splendid victory that the pope is said to have exclaimed—“the Americans have done more for Christendom in one battle, than all Europe in a century.” In a few days after this affair Stewart received a commission of master and commander, and in every subsequent operation against the enemy proved himself worthy of the promotion. On the commencement of hostilities with England, he had been appointed to the command of the Constellation, which required so much repair, that the greatest exertion and industry had now been exercised for several months, under the superintendance of Stewart, to render her competent for service. On the twenty-sixth day of November, however, her repairs were completed, and she was only waiting for a few additional hands to proceed to sea. Arrangements had been previously made by her polite commander for giving on that day a splendid entertainment on board the frigate, to terminate with a grand ball, to which several hundred ladies and gentlemen were specially invited. The President of the United States, heads of departments, and most of the members of congress, were present on the occasion; besides Hull, Morris, and many other naval officers. In return for this fanciful and brilliant aquatic fete, the principal citizens of Washington determined to treat the gallant Stewart with a Naval Ball on shore, and the evening of the eighth of December had been pitched upon for that purpose, when our hero arrived in the city and was immediately honored with a card of invitation. The preparations and arrangements for this fete exhibited a taste and splendor befitting the occasion. The rooms were fancifully decorated with appropriate ornaments, interspersed with nautical emblems, national banners, and trophies of naval victory. The colors of the Guerriere and Alert were displayed on the walls, beneath the festoons of “striped bunting” suspended from the cornices. Nothing had been omitted on the part of the managers that could please the eye, exhilarate the fancy, or gratify the taste. But an unexpected zest awaited this entertainment, calculated to elevate the usual serene glow of festive joy, to a paroxysm of enthusiastic rapture. Towards evening, while many an ardent fancy was enjoying in anticipation the promised pleasures of the approaching scene, private letters from New-York announced the glorious news of another Naval Victory, which a printed handbill (issued from the press of the Intelligencer) soon circulated through the city, amid the most lively demonstrations of joy. The sum of this vivifying intelligence was this—“Commodore Decatur, of the frigate United States, had captured and brought into port, the British frigate Macedonian, after an action of seventeen minutes; and that lieutenant Hamilton, son to the secretary of the navy, was on his way to the seat of government with the official account of the engagement.” Every face that entered the ball-room was dressed in smiles—every bosom bounded with delight, and the sprightly dancers seemed to “tread on air.” A large and very respectable company soon assembled, among whom were the first characters in the nation; the beauty, taste, fashion, and virtue, of Columbia District, were here concentred in one festive mansion. All was joy and gaiety, such as could scarcely admit of augmentation; and yet it was destined to be increased. About nine o'clock, as our hero was engaged in conversation with the amiable sisters of lieutenant Hamilton, whom he was felicitating on the safety of their gallant brother, and the pleasure of a speedy meeting, a rumor ran through the assembly that the young hero had already arrived, bearing the colors of the Macedonian and dispatches from his commodore to the secretary. The effect was electrical. “He is come!” reiterated the affectionate sisters--“He is come!” exclaimed the delighted father—the tears of a doating mother expressed her silent joy. The gentlemen rushed out of the room and crowded down the stairs to meet the herald of victory, who was received with loud acclamations and repeated huzzas; every shout vibrated through some tender bosoms in the festive hall. The crowd are now heard reascending the stairs— eyes glisten—bosoms palpitate; they enter the hall, and young Hamilton flies into the extended arms of a fond father, mother, sisters! It was a scene more easily conceived than described. The hall, as before intimated, was decorated with the trophies of naval victory—the colors of the Guerriere and the Alert, displayed on the walls, roused the proud feelings of patriotism, and had revived in every mind the recollection of the bravery which won them. The flag of the Macedonian alone was wanting to complete the group. It was now produced, and borne into the hall by Hull, Stewart and others, amid the loud acclamations of the company, and greeted with national music from the band. The amusements of the evening were suspended from the arrival of Hamilton, until the fervor of the moment had in some degree subsided. Mutual gratulations went round the room; a general expression of the tribute due to skill and valor, involuntarily broke from the lips of all; and the smile of beauty, the meed of valor, was liberally bestowed on the brave defenders of their country's rights. Subsequently at the supper table, a toast was given by one of the managers---“Commodore Decatur and the officers and crew of the frigate United States”---and received with the greatest enthusiasm, and repeated plaudits. The following is a copy of the despatches which young Hamilton delivered to his father: “U. S. F. United States, at Sea, October 30, 1812. “The Hon. Paul Hamilton, “Sir—I have the honor to inform you, that on the 25th inst. being in the lat. 29 N. long. 29, 30, W. we fell in with, and, after an action of an hour and an half, captured his Britannic Majesty's ship Macedonian, commanded by captain John Carden, and mounting forty-nine carriage guns (the odd gun shifting.) She is a frigate of the largest class, two years old, four months out of dock, and reputed one of the best sailors in the British service. The enemy being to windward, had the advantage of engaging us at his own distance, which was so great, that for the first half hour we did not use our carronades, and at no moment was he within the complete effect of our musketry and grape—to this circumstance and a heavy swell, which was on at the time, I ascribe the unusual length of the action. “The enthusiasm of every officer, seaman and marine on board this ship, on discovering the enemy—their steady conduct in battle, and precision of their fire, could not be surpassed. Where all met my fullest expections, it would be unjust in me to discriminate. Permit me, however, to recommend to your particular notice, my first lieutenant, William H. Allen.[5] [5] See vol. i. p. 75. He has served with me upwards of five years, and to his unremitted exertions in disciplining the crew, is to be imputed the obvious superiority of our gunnery exhibited in the result of the contest. Subjoined is a list of the killed and wounded on both sides. Our loss, compared with that of the enemy, will appear small. Amongst our wounded you will observe the name of lieutenant Funk, who died in a few hours after the action—he was an officer of great gallantry and promise, and the service has sustained a severe loss in his death. “The Macedonian lost her mizen-mast, fore and main-top-masts and main yard, and was much cut up in her hull. The damage sustained by this ship was not such as to render her return into port necessary, and had I not deemed it important that we should see our prize in, should have continued our cruise. “With the highest consideration and respect, I am, sir, your obedient humble servant. (Signed) “STEPHEN DECATUR.” In the above affair there were but five Americans killed and seven wounded, while the British suffered a loss of thirty-six killed and sixty-eight wounded! In a letter to his father, George gave a detailed account of all the foregoing circumstances, and then proceeded in the following manner: “So much for Carden's confidence in his own experience, and in the superiority of the Macedonian. “Experience is a dear school;” but in no other, it seems, would this gentleman become convinced of his error. The largest frigate in the British navy, has been dismasted and compelled to surrender, with one third of her crew killed and wounded, by an American frigate which Carden (in my hearing in Norfolk) pronounced inferior to his own ship; adding, that “from experience he felt satisfied he could take the United States with the Macedonian!”[6] [6] See vol. i. p. 193. What a gratification will this news be to Aylwin! “But even Americans are astonished at the unparalleled effects of Decatur's fire. His ship was literally enveloped in flames, which drew repeated shouts from the British, who supposed her to be actually on fire. When the Macedonian struck, she had nothing standing but her fore and main masts, and fore-yard. The fore and main masts were badly wounded, and every spar, even to the smallest, cut. She received nearly one hundred shots in her hull, several of which were between wind and water. All her boats were rendered useless, excepting a small one, which was veered out astern before the action commenced. But, so little was the United States impaired, that in five minutes after she had possession of the Macedonian, she was completely ready for another action. “When captain Carden came on board the United States to present his sword to commodore Decatur, the commodore said—“Sir, I cannot receive the sword of a man who has so bravely defended his ship, but I will receive your hand.” You can easily imagine what must have been the impression produced by this noble reception of a vanquished enemy. “I have been favored with the perusal of a letter from an officer of the United States to his friend, from which I copy the following: “After securing our prisoners, I was sent on board the prize to assist in fitting her out, which we did in a few days, under jury masts. I assure you, the scene she exhibited just after the action was distressing to humanity; fragments of the dead were distributed in every direction—the decks covered with blood—one continued agonizing yell of the unhappy wounded victims; a 32 scene so horrible of my fellow-creatures, I assure you, deprived me very much of the pleasure of victory.” “I have seen an extract from the muster-roll found on board the Macedonian, after her capture, from which it appears that there were seven impressed Americans on board of that frigate at the time of the action, who were compelled to fight against their own countrymen! Two of them (John Card and John Wallis[7] [7] See vol. i. p. 204. ) were killed in the contest! and another (William Thompson) had been drowned at sea while compelled to assist in boarding a vessel of his own country! As these men were O'Hara's shipmates, you will not fail to communicate their melancholy fate to him—if he has yet arrived. “Decatur now stands pre-eminent among the Champions of Naval Freedom, for he has not only conquered the enemy, but added a valuable ship to our rising navy. This victory, however, was not wanting to stamp him a hero. The fame he acquired in the Mediterranean during the war with Tripoli is an inheritance of which nothing can deprive him; even a defeat, instead of the recent victory, would (like a spot in the sun) have been lost in the unfaded splendor of his former achievements. Perhaps you may have forgotten the event to which I allude, and therefore I will briefly relate the circumstances attending it. “The Philadelphia frigate, commanded by Bainbridge, in chasing the Tripolitans, ran aground in or near the harbor of Tripoli, and fell into the hands of the enemy. As soon as Decatur (then a lieutenant) heard of the unfortu nate event, the idea immediately presented itself to his mind of attempting her recapture or destruction; and, with some difficulty, he obtained the permission of commodore Preble to undertake the daring enterprise. Having selected for the expedition a ketch (the Intrepid) which he had captured from the enemy a few weeks before, and having manned her with seventy volunteers, chiefly from his own crew, he sailed from Syracuse for the harbor of Tripoli, accompanied by the Syren, commanded by the gallant Stewart, (on whose account the late ball was given) who was to aid with his boats, and to receive the crew of the ketch, in case it should be found expedient to use her as a fire-ship.[8] [8] See Analectic Magazine, vol. i. p. 503. “After fifteen days of very tempestuous weather, they arrived at the harbor of Tripoli, a little before sunset. It had been arranged between Decatur and Stewart, that the ketch should enter the harbor about ten o'clock that night, attended by the boats of the Syren. On arriving off the harbor, the Syren, in consequence of a change of wind, had been thrown six or eight miles without the Intrepid. The wind at this time was fair, but fast declining, and Decatur apprehended that, should he wait for the Syren's boats to come up, it might be too late to make the attack that night. Such delay might be fatal to the enterprise, as they could not remain long on the coast, their provisions being nearly exhausted. For these reasons he determined to venture into the harbor alone, which he did at about eight o'clock. “An idea may be formed of the extreme hazard of this enterprise from the situation of the frigate. She was moored within half gun-shot of the bashaw's castle, and of the principal battery. Two of the enemy's cruisers lay within two cables' length, on the starboard quarter, and their gun-boats within half gun-shot on the starboard bow. All the guns of the frigate were mounted and loaded. Such were the immediate perils which this hero ventured to encounter with a single ketch, beside the other dangers that abound in a strongly fortified harbor. “Although from the entrance to where the frigate lay was only three miles, yet, in consequence of the lightness of the wind, they did not get within hail of her until eleven o'clock. When they had approached within two hundred yards, they were hailed and ordered to anchor, or they would be fired into. Decatur ordered a Maltese pilot, who was on board the ketch, to answer that they had lost their anchors in a gale of wind on the coast, and, therefore, could not comply with their request. By this time it had become perfectly calm, and they were about fifty yards from the frigate. Decatur ordered a small boat that was alongside of the ketch, to take a rope, and make it fast to the frigate's fore chains. This being done, they began to warp the ketch alongside. It was not until this moment that the enemy suspected the character of their visitor, and great confusion immediately ensued. This enabled the adventurers to get alongside of the frigate, when Decatur immediately sprang aboard, followed by midshipman Morris, (who, you know, was wounded in the action with the Guerriere and now commands the Adams.) These two were nearly a minute on deck, before their companions could succeed in mounting the side. Fortunately the Turks were not sufficiently recovered from their surprise to take advantage of this delay. They were crowded together on the quarter-deck, perfectly astonished and aghast, without making any attempt to oppose the assailing party. As soon as a sufficient number of Americans had gained the deck, to form a front equal to that of the enemy, they rushed in upon them. The Turks stood the assault but a short time, and were completely overpowered. About twenty were killed on the spot, many jumped overboard, and the rest fled to the main deck, whither they were pursued and driven to the hold. “After entire possession had been gained of the ship, and every thing prepared to set fire to her, a number of launches were seen rowing round the harbor. This determined Decatur to remain in the frigate, from whence a better defence could be made than from on board the ketch. The enemy had already commenced firing upon them from their batteries and castle, and from two corsairs that were lying near. Perceiving that the launches did not attempt to approach, he ordered that the ship should be set on fire, which was done, at the same time, in different parts. As soon as this was completely effected, they left her; and such was the rapidity of the flames, that it was with the utmost difficulty they preserved the ketch. At this critical moment a most propitious breeze sprang up, blowing directly out of the harbor, which, in a few minutes, carried them beyond the reach of the enemy's guns, and they made good their retreat without the loss of a single man, and with but four wounded. 32* “For this gallant and romantic achievement, lieutenant Decatur was promoted to the rank of post-captain, there being, at that time, no intermediate grade. This promotion was particularly gratifying to him, inasmuch as it was done with the consent of the officers over whose heads he was raised. “In the bombardment of Tripoli, on the ensuing spring, Decatur commanded one of the divisions of gun-boats, and captured one of the enemy's boats by boarding. As he was about to proceed out with his prize, a boat which had been commanded by his brother came under his stern, and informed him, that they had engaged and captured one of the enemy; but that her commander, after surrendering, had treacherously shot his brother, and pushed off with the boat, and was then making for the harbor. “The feelings of the gallant Decatur, on receiving this intelligence, may more easily be imagined than described. Every consideration of prudence and safety, was lost in his eagerness to punish so dastardly an act, and to revenge the death of a brother so basely murdered? He pushed within the enemy's line with his single boat, and having succeeded in getting alongside of the retreating foe, boarded her at the head of eleven men, who were all the Americans he had left. “The fate of this contest was extremely doubtful for twenty minutes. All the Americans except four were now severely wounded. Decatur singled out the commander, as the peculiar object of his vengeance. The Turk was armed with an espontoon, Decatur with a cutlass; in attempting to cut off the head of the weapon, his sword struck on the iron, and broke close to the hilt. The Turk at this moment made a push, which slightly wounded him in the right arm and breast. He immediately seized the spear and closed with him. A fierce struggle ensued, and both fell, Decatur uppermost. By this time, the Turk had drawn a dagger from his belt, and was about to plunge it in the body of his foe, when Decatur caught his arm, and shot him with a pistol, which he had taken from his pocket. During the time they were struggling on the deck, the crews rushed to the aid of their commanders, and a most sanguinary conflict took place, insomuch, that when Decatur had dispatched his adversary, it was with the greatest difficulty he could extricate himself from the killed and wounded that had fallen around him. “During the early part of the struggle, Decatur was assailed in the rear by one of the enemy, who had just aimed a blow at his head with his sabre, that must have been fatal. At this fearful juncture, a noble-hearted tar, who had been so badly wounded as to lose the use of his hands, seeing no other means of saving his commander, rushed between him and the uplifted sabre, and received the blow on his own head, which fractured his scull. The generous fellow survived, and now receives a pension from government. “Decatur succeeded in getting with both of his prizes to the squadron, and on the next day received the highest commendation, in a general order, from commodore Preble. “Such are the achievements by which this gallant officer had rendered himself immortal, previous to the capture of the Macedonian. May he long live to enjoy his well-merited honors.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLII. AN UNSUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE. 'Tis not in mortals to command success. Cato. On Monday, the fourth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and thirteen, ensign Willoughby received official notice from the war department, that he had been included in an exchange of prisoners which had been recently effected. This information was accompanied with a lieutenant's commission, bearing date from the battle of Queenston, and orders to proceed to Albany, and report himself to general Dearborn. The blaze of glory which now streamed from the ocean, had scattered the mists of prejudice from the eyes of many politicians, who had heretofore opposed an increase of the naval establishment. The eyes of Congress were at length opened to the true interests of the nation, and an act was immediately passed for building and equipping four seventy-fours and six forty-fours. Another act immediately followed for the further increase and more perfect organization of the army, which was to be augmented by an indefinite number of regiments, whose term of service was limited to twelve months. Many other measures were also adopted by government, at the commencement of this year, for promoting the success of the American arms, both by sea and land. When our hero arrived at the head-quarters of the Northern army, he found that no operations were on foot against the enemy. The troops on the Niagara, under Smyth, (called the army of the centre) after several fruitless attempts to cross the river, had retired into winter-quarters, and the volunteers had returned home, venting their imprecations on their general, whom they considered a vaporing braggart, destitute of those talents which were necessary to lead an army to conquest and glory. The Northern army were also in winter-quarters, consisting of less than six thousand men, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, and militia. The only army now in the field, was that under Harrison, who continued to brave the inelemencies of a winter campaign, determined to take no repose until they had regained Detroit, and found winter-quarters in the enemy's country. An unfortunate disaster, however, befel this army on the twenty-second day of January, as the reader will perceive by the following letter from Major Willoughby to his son, which he received on the tenth of February. “Mulberry-Grove, January 29, 1813. “MY DEAR BOY, “Yours of the fifteenth December came duly to hand, and has yielded me indescribable pleasure. The unparalleled achievements of our gallant sailors, must convince every man, not blinded by prejudice, of the importance of a respectable naval establishment. This is a point to which the strength and resources of our country can be directed with advantage—with honor— with complete success. Congress will become convinced of this without a very long study in that dear school you speak of. “O'Hara arrived here, after a journey of twenty days. The unexpected meeting had like to have proved as fatal to his affectionate sister, as the report of his death proved to his poor debilitated father. His return has dressed the whole family in smiles, which are at times, however, a little overclouded by his expressing a determination to enter on board the squadron, which is to be established on Lake Erie. “When I wrote you last, every thing in the Northwest was going on prosperously, and I had no doubt but that my next would contain the pleasing intelligence of Harrison having recovered all that Hull lost. But my present task is a less pleasing one, for I am to announce a disaster, which will long be felt and mourned by our bleeding country. “I think I told you, in my last, that the army was proceeding from Fort Defiance towards the Lake; but I forgot to mention a previous circumstance which I know will be interesting to you, and which shall therefore be noticed in this place. It is in some measure connected with the event I allude to, and you will come to the melancholy catastrophe soon enough. “Ever since the commencement of hostilities, our old friend Logan (whom Hull, in his official despatch represented as an enemy) has been very solicitous to espouse the cause of the United States,[9] [9] In General Hull's official communication to the Secretary of War, giving his reason for surrendering Detroit with the army to the enemy, he says, “Among the vast number of chiefs who led the hostile bands, Tecumseh, Marplot, Logan, Walk-in-the-water, Split-Log, etc. are considered theprincipals. notwithstanding the flattering offers of the British, which he had uniformly rejected and spurned with contempt. Several other chiefs who were wavering, and stood ready to lead their followers to either standard, as circumstances might invite, entertained so much respect for the opinions and example of Logan, that they agreed to be governed by his decision. Of this the British were well aware, and spared no exertions to win over to their cause a chieftain of such acknowledged bravery and extensive influence. “But Logan possessed too much integrity to be seduced into a cause which his soul condemned, or to sell the services of his faithful followers to support injustice and unwarrantable aggression. Many a feudal lord in Christendom has, on a like occasion, evinced less of the Christian spirit than this heathen. He repeatedly solicited Harrison to accept of his services; who, after considerable hesitation on the part of government, was finally permitted to give him employment, and he joined the American army, in September last, when marching to relieve Fort Wayne, which, you know, was then closely besieged. The army approached that place on the evening of the twelfth, when the invaders fled with precipitation. Logan went forward with about seven hundred of his men, raised an Indian yell, and pursued the retreating tribes. The signal was answered by them, at the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards; but the intervention of the river, and several other obstacles, prevented the pursuit being attended with effect. “Having thus raised the siege of Fort Wayne,[10] [10] Fort Wayne is situated at the confluence of St. Joseph's and St. Maty's rivers, whose waters united form the river called the Miami of the Lakes, which empties into Erie. Two hundred miles below this fortress, stands Fort Defiance, (or, as it has lately been called, Fort Winchester) which is built on the point of land formed by the confluence of the Aux Glaize with the Miami, about half way between Fort Wayne and Fort Meigs; the latter stands near the rapids of this river, and consequently not a great distance from the Lake. Harrison and Winchester immediately made preparations for marching a sufficient number of troops down the bank of the river, to relieve the intermediate garrisons between that place and Detroit. Through the exertions of our worthy and patriotic governor,[11] [11] His excellency R. J. Meigs, who was afterwards appointed PostMaster-General of the United States. every necessary supply was forwarded with the greatest despatch to the army, and Winchester advanced with about two thousand men down the river towards Fort Defiance, while Harrison fixed his head-quarters at St. Mary's, about sixty miles apart. On approaching his place of destination, after a tedious march of seven days, Winchester found the fort in possession of the enemy, who were so strong that he thought it imprudent to proceed; he therefore sent to Harrison for reinforcements, who immediately proceeded with general Tupper's mounted men, to the assistance of his friend. The British and Indians, however, did not wait to receive him; but, as soon as they heard of his approach, evacuated the Fort, and took the cannon with them down the river towards the rapids. “A considerable period of inactivity succeeded this event. Harrison had departed to join the right wing of the army, and to concentrate the whole at an appointed rendezvous. Until this concentration could be effected, any further movements would not tend to promote the end in view. “But during this interval, Logan was sighing for more active employment. Such deliberate operations were not exactly congenial to his ideas of carrying on the war; he wished to be in the field with the enemy in front. While thus goaded by his own impatient ardor to act, a rumor had reached his ears that the American officers had expressed doubts of his boasted courage and skill in war, as he had been so long with the army and done nothing. “Logan either fears or loves the enemy.” This was too much for Logan. Stung to the soul, he immediately demanded employment, when Winchester permitted him to take two of his followers, and proceed down the river bank to examine the movements of the enemy. In executing this service they had to pass a narrow defile in the forest, from which an ambuscade darted so suddenly upon them that they were instantly made prisoners. “What must have been the feelings of Logan, who, so far from having redeemed the reputation which he imagined had been tarnished, was now perhaps forever deprived of the power! The party which had captured them consisted of five mounted warriors, under the command of the celebrated Wynemack. Nothing but a stratagem could rescue the prisoners, and Logan's ready invention quickly contrived one. He addressed himself to Wynemack, expressing much surprise at such hostile treatment of men who had risked so much in coming to join them. “Since you see we are friends, (he added) there is no time to be lost; follows us, and an encampment of white men can be surprised and destroyed.” The credulous victors believed him, and permitted their three captives to lead them on to the anticipated massacre. 33 Logan having communicated to his comrades his determination to rescue himself, or perish in the effort, they wheeled suddenly on their enemy, and each brought his man to the ground: Wynemack being one of the fallen. The remaining three instantly returned the fire, (which wounded Logan and one of his men) and then made off. Logan exchanged the shot, notwithstanding his wound was mortal; and springing with his wounded companion, upon the horses of two of those whom they had just killed, whilst his third man protected him in his retreat, he returned to the fort. This happened on the twenty-second of November; on the twenty-eighth he expired, with the firmness of a brave warrior, sincerely regretted by the whole garrison. “Thus has our faithful, generous friend split his life's blood in the cause of American freedom; being the second of the name whom the history of our country will notice for his attachment to her cause. His brave and enterprising son, who is now in the field, will be the third; be forever grateful, George, that you was made the instrument of preserving a life which will always be devoted to the defence of our country. “Some time after the foregoing event, the left wing of the army, under Winchester, marched from Fort Defiance down to the rapids, in conformity to the order of Harrison, who had removed his head-quarters to Upper Sandusky. In the mean time, from the movements of the enemy, the inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the river Raisin, became so seriously alarmed, that they solicited Winchester to march immediately to their protection, although the troops at that time under his command were far inferior in numbers to the collected force of the British and Indians by whom the village was menaced. In compliance with this earnest solicitation, but without the authority or knowledge of the commander in chief, Winchester determined upon marching, with his small force, (then reduced to eight hundred men, by the discharge of those regiments whose term of service had expired) to prevent, if possible, the destruction of the village, and the massacre of the inhabitants. “Very wrong as a soldier, but very right as a man.” “Colonel Lewis marched first, with his detachment, which was to be joined on the way by that of lieutenant-colonel Allen, and followed by the main body under Winchester himself. On approaching Frenchtown, Lewis was informed that about five hundred of the enemy were already encamped in the village; and, without hesitation, determined to attack them. The charge was impetuous and successful; he carried the picketing of their right wing with ease, dislodged both British and Indians, and drove them into the woods. Allen, with his detachment, made a simultaneous attack on the left, with the same success. Twice did the enemy rally, and renew the contest with desperation, and thrice were they compelled to retreat in disorder, and were finally entirely dispersed. In this conflict much blood was spilt on both sides. “Lewis encamped on the same ground which had been occupied by the enemy, and was, in two days after, joined by Winchester with the remainder of his troops, now amounting in all to about seven hundred and fifty effective men. Six hundred were posted in pickets, and the rest encamped in an open field. “On the morning of the twenty-second instant, at revellee, Proctor and Tecumseh, at the head of above two thousand men, attacked the encampment so suddenly that many of the Americans were literally cut to pieces. They were soon formed, however, and after repelling the assailants for some time with unparalleled coolness and intrepidity, the combatants closed in a promiscuous fray. The contest was now long, obstinate, and sanguinary; but more like a massacre than a regular battle. Winchester's quarters were several hundred yards from the encampment, to which he had scarcely arrived when he was taken prisoner. Seeing his brave countrymen desperately contending with such superior force, and covering the field with their slain, Winchester sent a flag to the field and advised a surrender, which advice was complied with. The loss of the Americans was two hundred and ninety-seven men killed and missing, twenty-two of whom were officers. Only twenty-five were wounded, which shows the desperate valor with which the contest was maintained—“every wound was a death,” with this trifling exception. The loss of the enemy was not less, but could not be ascertained, as they resorted to their usual means of preventing a discovery, by removing the bodies, &amp;c. “But the most horrid part of my story is yet to be told. The express conditions of the surrender were—that the Americans should be protected from the fury of the savages; that private property should be respected, and that the sidearms of the officers should be returned. Not one of these conditions was complied with. No sooner had the Americans relinquished their arms, than they were robbed of every thing, under uplifted tomahawks and scalping-knives, and stripped even of their personal apparel. Every prisoner whose wounds rendered him unable to march to Malden, was murdered and scalped on the spot, and all who gave out on the way, shared the same bloody fate. Many of the houses in Frenchtown were wantonly burnt, and several defenceless inhabitants, who had not been in the engagement, inhumanly butchered without provocation. To be sure, all these atrocities were committed by Indians—but their white allies did not raise a finger to prevent them. The blood rests on British heads. “The barbarities of the enemy, (both white and red) are shocking beyond conception; and, as judge Woodward told Proctor, will one day “meet the steady and impartial eye of history.” Dr. M`Keehan, surgeon's mate to the second regiment of our Ohio militia, was sent to Malden under the protection of a flag, to attend to the sick and wounded prisoners. But regardless of the sanctity of his flag, he was fired upon by the enemy, near the rapids, his companion killed, himself wounded, and he is now in close confinement as a spy! “General Armstrong, I understand, has been appointed secretary of war, in the room of Eustis, who has resigned.

His return has dressed the whole family in smiles, which are at times, however, a little overclouded by his expressing a determination to enter on board the squadron, which is to be established on Lake Erie. “When I wrote you last, every thing in the Northwest was going on prosperously, and I had no doubt but that my next would contain the pleasing intelligence of Harrison having recovered all that Hull lost. But my present task is a less pleasing one, for I am to announce a disaster, which will long be felt and mourned by our bleeding country. “I think I told you, in my last, that the army was proceeding from Fort Defiance towards the Lake; but I forgot to mention a previous circumstance which I know will be interesting to you, and which shall therefore be noticed in this place. It is in some measure connected with the event I allude to, and you will come to the melancholy catastrophe soon enough. “Ever since the commencement of hostilities, our old friend Logan (whom Hull, in his official despatch represented as an enemy) has been very solicitous to espouse the cause of the United States,[9] [9] In General Hull's official communication to the Secretary of War, giving his reason for surrendering Detroit with the army to the enemy, he says, “Among the vast number of chiefs who led the hostile bands, Tecumseh, Marplot, Logan, Walk-in-the-water, Split-Log, etc. are considered theprincipals. notwithstanding the flattering offers of the British, which he had uniformly rejected and spurned with contempt. Several other chiefs who were wavering, and stood ready to lead their followers to either standard, as circumstances might invite, entertained so much respect for the opinions and example of Logan, that they agreed to be governed by his decision. Of this the British were well aware, and spared no exertions to win over to their cause a chieftain of such acknowledged bravery and extensive influence. “But Logan possessed too much integrity to be seduced into a cause which his soul condemned, or to sell the services of his faithful followers to support injustice and unwarrantable aggression. Many a feudal lord in Christendom has, on a like occasion, evinced less of the Christian spirit than this heathen. He repeatedly solicited Harrison to accept of his services; who, after considerable hesitation on the part of government, was finally permitted to give him employment, and he joined the American army, in September last, when marching to relieve Fort Wayne, which, you know, was then closely besieged. The army approached that place on the evening of the twelfth, when the invaders fled with precipitation. Logan went forward with about seven hundred of his men, raised an Indian yell, and pursued the retreating tribes. The signal was answered by them, at the distance of about one hundred and fifty yards; but the intervention of the river, and several other obstacles, prevented the pursuit being attended with effect. “Having thus raised the siege of Fort Wayne,[10] [10] Fort Wayne is situated at the confluence of St. Joseph's and St. Maty's rivers, whose waters united form the river called the Miami of the Lakes, which empties into Erie. Two hundred miles below this fortress, stands Fort Defiance, (or, as it has lately been called, Fort Winchester) which is built on the point of land formed by the confluence of the Aux Glaize with the Miami, about half way between Fort Wayne and Fort Meigs; the latter stands near the rapids of this river, and consequently not a great distance from the Lake. Harrison and Winchester immediately made preparations for marching a sufficient number of troops down the bank of the river, to relieve the intermediate garrisons between that place and Detroit. Through the exertions of our worthy and patriotic governor,[11] [11] His excellency R. J. Meigs, who was afterwards appointed PostMaster-General of the United States. every necessary supply was forwarded with the greatest despatch to the army, and Winchester advanced with about two thousand men down the river towards Fort Defiance, while Harrison fixed his head-quarters at St. Mary's, about sixty miles apart. On approaching his place of destination, after a tedious march of seven days, Winchester found the fort in possession of the enemy, who were so strong that he thought it imprudent to proceed; he therefore sent to Harrison for reinforcements, who immediately proceeded with general Tupper's mounted men, to the assistance of his friend. The British and Indians, however, did not wait to receive him; but, as soon as they heard of his approach, evacuated the Fort, and took the cannon with them down the river towards the rapids. “A considerable period of inactivity succeeded this event. Harrison had departed to join the right wing of the army, and to concentrate the whole at an appointed rendezvous. Until this concentration could be effected, any further movements would not tend to promote the end in view. “But during this interval, Logan was sighing for more active employment. Such deliberate operations were not exactly congenial to his ideas of carrying on the war; he wished to be in the field with the enemy in front. While thus goaded by his own impatient ardor to act, a rumor had reached his ears that the American officers had expressed doubts of his boasted courage and skill in war, as he had been so long with the army and done nothing. “Logan either fears or loves the enemy.” This was too much for Logan. Stung to the soul, he immediately demanded employment, when Winchester permitted him to take two of his followers, and proceed down the river bank to examine the movements of the enemy. In executing this service they had to pass a narrow defile in the forest, from which an ambuscade darted so suddenly upon them that they were instantly made prisoners. “What must have been the feelings of Logan, who, so far from having redeemed the reputation which he imagined had been tarnished, was now perhaps forever deprived of the power! The party which had captured them consisted of five mounted warriors, under the command of the celebrated Wynemack. Nothing but a stratagem could rescue the prisoners, and Logan's ready invention quickly contrived one. He addressed himself to Wynemack, expressing much surprise at such hostile treatment of men who had risked so much in coming to join them. “Since you see we are friends, (he added) there is no time to be lost; follows us, and an encampment of white men can be surprised and destroyed.” The credulous victors believed him, and permitted their three captives to lead them on to the anticipated massacre. 33 Logan having communicated to his comrades his determination to rescue himself, or perish in the effort, they wheeled suddenly on their enemy, and each brought his man to the ground: Wynemack being one of the fallen. The remaining three instantly returned the fire, (which wounded Logan and one of his men) and then made off. Logan exchanged the shot, notwithstanding his wound was mortal; and springing with his wounded companion, upon the horses of two of those whom they had just killed, whilst his third man protected him in his retreat, he returned to the fort. This happened on the twenty-second of November; on the twenty-eighth he expired, with the firmness of a brave warrior, sincerely regretted by the whole garrison. “Thus has our faithful, generous friend split his life's blood in the cause of American freedom; being the second of the name whom the history of our country will notice for his attachment to her cause. His brave and enterprising son, who is now in the field, will be the third; be forever grateful, George, that you was made the instrument of preserving a life which will always be devoted to the defence of our country. “Some time after the foregoing event, the left wing of the army, under Winchester, marched from Fort Defiance down to the rapids, in conformity to the order of Harrison, who had removed his head-quarters to Upper Sandusky. In the mean time, from the movements of the enemy, the inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the river Raisin, became so seriously alarmed, that they solicited Winchester to march immediately to their protection, although the troops at that time under his command were far inferior in numbers to the collected force of the British and Indians by whom the village was menaced. In compliance with this earnest solicitation, but without the authority or knowledge of the commander in chief, Winchester determined upon marching, with his small force, (then reduced to eight hundred men, by the discharge of those regiments whose term of service had expired) to prevent, if possible, the destruction of the village, and the massacre of the inhabitants. “Very wrong as a soldier, but very right as a man.” “Colonel Lewis marched first, with his detachment, which was to be joined on the way by that of lieutenant-colonel Allen, and followed by the main body under Winchester himself. On approaching Frenchtown, Lewis was informed that about five hundred of the enemy were already encamped in the village; and, without hesitation, determined to attack them. The charge was impetuous and successful; he carried the picketing of their right wing with ease, dislodged both British and Indians, and drove them into the woods. Allen, with his detachment, made a simultaneous attack on the left, with the same success. Twice did the enemy rally, and renew the contest with desperation, and thrice were they compelled to retreat in disorder, and were finally entirely dispersed. In this conflict much blood was spilt on both sides. “Lewis encamped on the same ground which had been occupied by the enemy, and was, in two days after, joined by Winchester with the remainder of his troops, now amounting in all to about seven hundred and fifty effective men. Six hundred were posted in pickets, and the rest encamped in an open field. “On the morning of the twenty-second instant, at revellee, Proctor and Tecumseh, at the head of above two thousand men, attacked the encampment so suddenly that many of the Americans were literally cut to pieces. They were soon formed, however, and after repelling the assailants for some time with unparalleled coolness and intrepidity, the combatants closed in a promiscuous fray. The contest was now long, obstinate, and sanguinary; but more like a massacre than a regular battle. Winchester's quarters were several hundred yards from the encampment, to which he had scarcely arrived when he was taken prisoner. Seeing his brave countrymen desperately contending with such superior force, and covering the field with their slain, Winchester sent a flag to the field and advised a surrender, which advice was complied with. The loss of the Americans was two hundred and ninety-seven men killed and missing, twenty-two of whom were officers. Only twenty-five were wounded, which shows the desperate valor with which the contest was maintained—“every wound was a death,” with this trifling exception. The loss of the enemy was not less, but could not be ascertained, as they resorted to their usual means of preventing a discovery, by removing the bodies, &amp;c. “But the most horrid part of my story is yet to be told. The express conditions of the surrender were—that the Americans should be protected from the fury of the savages; that private property should be respected, and that the sidearms of the officers should be returned. Not one of these conditions was complied with. No sooner had the Americans relinquished their arms, than they were robbed of every thing, under uplifted tomahawks and scalping-knives, and stripped even of their personal apparel. Every prisoner whose wounds rendered him unable to march to Malden, was murdered and scalped on the spot, and all who gave out on the way, shared the same bloody fate. Many of the houses in Frenchtown were wantonly burnt, and several defenceless inhabitants, who had not been in the engagement, inhumanly butchered without provocation. To be sure, all these atrocities were committed by Indians—but their white allies did not raise a finger to prevent them. The blood rests on British heads. “The barbarities of the enemy, (both white and red) are shocking beyond conception; and, as judge Woodward told Proctor, will one day “meet the steady and impartial eye of history.” Dr. M`Keehan, surgeon's mate to the second regiment of our Ohio militia, was sent to Malden under the protection of a flag, to attend to the sick and wounded prisoners. But regardless of the sanctity of his flag, he was fired upon by the enemy, near the rapids, his companion killed, himself wounded, and he is now in close confinement as a spy! “General Armstrong, I understand, has been appointed secretary of war, in the room of Eustis, who has resigned. Write often, and believe me to be, as ever, your affectionate father, “EDWARD WILLOUGHBY.”</field>

All the gloomy clouds that hover O'er the cheerless Western plain, Shall Atlantic billows cover, Ocean wash out every stain. On the twentieth day of February, our hero, (who had written to Morse an account of Winchester's defeat, as recorded in the foregoing chapter) received the following answer, a copy of which he immediately forwarded to his father. Boston, Mas. February 16, 1813. “I hasten, my dear brother, to furnish an antidote to the melancholy which the writing of your last must have occasioned. “Another British frigate has been captured and sunk by the staunch old Constitution; but— our friend and cousin—the amiable Aylwin, sleeps with —“the brave, who sink to rest, With all their country's honors blest.” This will, of course, be a drawback on your pleasure; but when you reflect (as I know you will) that his short life was marked with every trait of virtue and honor, that he fell in the service of his country, covered with glory, and that to those who have lived like Aylwin, death is only the commencement of a more glorious life—I say when you reflect on these things, you may with me regret the loss of his society, but will not be so selfish as to wish to recall him. His virtues belonged to his immortal part, and can never die. His friendship we shall still enjoy, and to his society we shall one day be restored. “A friend, when dead, is but removed from sight, Sunk in the lustre of eternal light; And when the parting storms of life are o'er, May yet rejoin us on a happier shore.” “The Constitution arrived at this port yesterday, and lieutenant Ludlow has proceeded to the seat of government with Bainbridge's official despatch to the secretary of the navy, and the colors of the vanquished enemy; which was his Britannic majesty's frigate Java, of forty-nine guns and four hundred and fifty men. I conversed a few minutes with Ludlow, who gave me the following account: “The action took place on the twenty-ninth of December, (the very day on which captain Hull, the former Commander of the constitution, was a guest at the dinner given by the corporation and citizens of New-York, in honor of the exploits of our naval heroes) in latitude thirteen, about ten leagues from the coast of Brazil, and lasted one hour and fifty-five minutes; in which time the Java was made a complete wreck, having her bowsprit and every mast and spar shot out of her. The Constitution had nine killed and twenty-five wounded. The Java had sixty killed and about a hundred wounded. Among the latter was her commander, Lambert, a very distinguished officer, mortally. From a letter written by one of her officers whilst on board the Constitution, it is evident that the wounded must have been considerably greater, and many must have died of their wounds previous to removal. The letter states sixty killed and a hundred and seventy wounded.” “Aylwin commanded the forecastle division, and Ludlow assured me that his bravery and marked coolness throughout the contest, gained him the admiration of his commander, and all who had an opportunity of witnessing him. When boarders were called to repel boarders, he mounted the quarter-deck hammock cloths, and, in the act of firing his pistols at the enemy, he received a ball through the same shoulder in which he was wounded before. Notwithstanding the serious nature of his wound, he continued at his post until the enemy had struck; and even then did not make known to the surgeon his own situation, nor until all the wounded had been dressed. His zeal and courage did not forsake him in his last moments: for a few days after the action, although laboring under considerable debility, and the most excruciating pain, he left his state-room, and repaired to quarters, when an engagement was expected with a ship, which afterwards proved to be the Hornet. He bore his pain with great and unusual fortitude, and expired, without a groan, on the twenty-eighth of January. “A dauntless soul erect, who smiled on death.” “The Java was rated at thirty-eight guns, but mounted forty-nine. She was just out of dock, and fitted in the most complete manner to carry out lieutenant-general Hislop, governor of Bombay, and his staff; captain Marshal, a commander in the British navy, and a number of naval officers going to join the British ships of war in the East Indies. Besides these, and having her own complement of officers and men complete, she had upwards of one hundred supernumeraries of petty officers and seamen for the admiral's ship and other vessels on the East India station. She also had despatches from the British government for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and every British establishment in the East Indies and China seas, and had copper on board for a seventy-four gun ship and two sloops of war, building at Bombay, and it is presumed many other valuables, all of which were blown up in her on the thirty-first of December, when she was set on fire. “The Constitution was considerably cut in her spars, rigging, and sails; but not so much injured but that she could have commenced another action immediately after the capture of the Java, which latter vessel was made a perfectly unmanageable wreck. “A seaman on board the Constitution, named John Cheeves, was mortally wounded, and whilst lying on the deck apparently dying, the word was passed that the enemy had struck. He raised himself up with one hand, gave three cheers, fell back, and expired! Heroic specimen of the genuine patriotism of American tars! His brother was also wounded, and has since died. They have left an aged and helpless mother at Marblehead, who depended entirely on the fruits of their industry for a subsistence. “The news of this third achievement of our favorite Constitution was announced from the stage by Mr. Powell, the manager, last evening, and was received with repeated acclamations. Rodgers and Hull, with their ladies, and several other officers of the navy, were present, and received congratulations on the event. “Gentlemen who have been on board the Constitution, which still lies in the lower harbor, mention having learnt that Bainbridge received two wounds in the action, one by a musket ball, the other by langrage; that the Java was well fought and bravely defended; and though the Constitution could have been prepared for another battle immediately, she was very considerably injured in her spars, sails, bulwarks, &amp;c. “The Constitution has on board part of the cargo of the schooner Helen, from London for St. Salvador, captured by the Hornet, captain Lawrence, off the latter port; the schooner was given up. “The Java touched at St. Jago, Cape de Verds, and learned that the Essex, captain Porter, had been there—and supposing the Constitution to be that frigate, with carronades only, kept at long shot, which prolonged the action. They learned by the officers of the Java that the Essex had captured a sloop of war, and four rich prizes. “The Hornet was left off St. Salvador, watching the British sloop of war Bonne Citoyenne, said to have on board one million seven hundred thousand dollars. Captain Lawrence had challenged the British captain to come out and try the fortune of war with him, but the wary Englishman declined the combat. They begin to respect “Yankee cock-boats.” “All the officers and seamen taken in the Java, were paroled by commodore Bainbridge, and landed on the third of January at St. Salvador, Brazils. “Honors are now lavished on Decatur and Jones similar to those which Hull has received. Bainbridge's turn comes next—and who next? Perhaps Rodgers; he strives hard to find the enemy, and would no doubt give a good account of them should he meet them. He arrived at this port on New-Year's day, at the same hour the Macedonian entered the harbor of New-York, through the Sound. Admiral Warren has arrived off that port, with a considerable squadron, and has expressed his determination to lay the whole coast, south of New-York, under a most strict and rigorous blockade. Our privateers are doing wonders. “Your friends here are all enjoying good health, and Amelia desires to be particularly remembered to her dear brother.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLIV. THE FIFTH NAVAL GARLAND. Be it my country's richer glory far With deeds of love to blunt the rage of war; Her sons—dread demons to the opposing foe— Angels of mercy, o'er a chief laid low. Such are the wreaths Columbia's brows that twine, And much I glory that I call her mine. Smith's Heroes of the Lake. It was now determined by government that the next operations against the enemy, should be an attack on Little York, the capital of Upper Canada, followed (if successful) by another on Kingston, and both to be succeeded by the capture of Fort George, Erie, and their dependencies. To effect these grand objects, Dearborn immediately commenced the most rigorous preparations. Reinforcements of regulars from every recruiting district were continually arriving, and the necessary supplies of provisions and military equipments were forwarded to the army with the greatest celerity. General Brown was with his family at Brownsville, and Ogdensburgh was commanded by the enterprising Forsyth, who had several times repeated his successful visits to the enemy's public store-houses, magazines, and military depots. On the twenty-first of February, however, the exasperated enemy appeared before Ogdensburg, with a force of twelve hundred men; and, after an obstinate contest, compelled Forsyth to evacuate the post, after losing twenty men in killed and wounded. The loss of the enemy was three times that number. The British commandant at Fort George was so elated with this trifling affair, that, in the pride of his heart, he sent a message to colonel M`Feely, the American commandant of Fort Niagara, informing him that a salute would be fired the next day at twelve o'clock, in honor of the capture of the American village. No immediate reply was made to this insulting message; but in the course of the same evening the news of Bainbridge's victory reached the American commandant, who dispatched a message to the exulting Englishman, with the compliments of colonel M`Feely, and the information that a national salute would be fired at the same hour, in honor of the capture and destruction of his Britannic majesty's frigate Java, by a Yankee cock-boat. On the twenty-seventh of March, our hero received a letter from Morse, which commenced in the following manner: “Boston, March 21, 1813. “Another Naval Victory, my dear George, has rewarded the courage and enterprise of American sailors, and the name of Lawrence is now inscribed with those of Hull, Decatur, Jones, and Bainbridge, on an imperishable pillar of glory. “On the twenty-fourth day of February last, while cruising off Demarara, the American sloop of war Hornet, commanded by captain Lawrence, fell in with the British brig Peacock, captain Peake, and captured her, after a sanguinary action of fourteen minutes. The contest commenced within half pistol shot, and so tremendous was the fire of the Americans, that when she surrendered she was an absolute wreck, in a sinking condition, displaying a signal of distress. Notwithstanding every exertion was made to keep 34 her afloat until the prisoners could be removed, she sunk with thirteen of her crew, and three brave American tars, who thus nobly perished in relieving a conquered foe. “The slaughter on board of the Peacock was very severe; among the slain was found the body of her commander, captain Peake. He was twice wounded in the course of the action; the last wound proved fatal. His body was wrapped in the flag of his ship, and laid in the cabin to sink with her; a shroud and sepulchre worthy so brave a sailor. “It is a fact worthy of note, and in the highest degree honorable to our brave tars, that on the day succeeding the destruction of the Peacock, the crew of the Hornet made a subscription and supplied the prisoners (who had lost almost every thing) with two shirts and a jacket and trowsers each. “It is singular, that in this action, when the first broadsides were exchanged at half pistol shot, the pendant on the mainmast of the Hornet was shot away, one man was killed in the top, and the upper rigging much injured, but no mark of a ball was seen below the main-top. The Hornet's fire had quite a different effect on the Peacock; it was so well directed, that several of the shot pierced the hull of the Peacock through and through, killed a number of men, and, in a measure, decided the contest. “This victory (says a morning paper) will excite afresh the wonder of the world! The sinking the British sloop of war Peacock, by the United States sloop of war Hornet, in fifteen minutes, will fill England with amazement and dismay. The Peacock was as large a vessel as the Hornet, and carried more guns. To cut this ship to pieces, to kill and wound between thirty and forty of her men, while the American ship lost but one killed and two wounded, is a circumstance so extraordinary, that it impresses the minds of our countrymen with an exultation mixed with solemnity! Is it merely our prowess—or is it the finger of Heaven pointing to the path of our future glory? These successes fill not the mind with a noisy and giddy joy, but with a solemn and grateful sentiment towards that Power which controls the world, and giveth us the victory, by “teaching our hands to war, and our fingers to fight!” “But enough, for the present, of `blood stained glory.' Accompany me, for a few minutes, in the humbler walks of civil and domestic life, and let the subject of our contemplation be Woman, `Heaven's last, best gift to man.' Harriet Palmer, whose gentle manners, amiable disposition, and unassuming excellence, had secured her the love of all her acquaintance—has gone to taste the fruits of virtue in `another and a better world.' Amelia and myself have just returned from paying the last sad duties to her mortal part, which has just been committed to its kindred earth. Her affectionate parents are in the deepest affliction, having previously received some distressing intelligence respecting Sophia, who married the old German, in New-York, where she has since resided. I am ignorant of the particulars, but believe that the connexion is not productive of the promised felicity. It was a money match, and they are seldom happy. This circumstance, it is believed, hastened the death of Harriet— “Yet other secret griefs had she, “O pillow! only told to thee: “Say, did not hopeless love intrude “On her poor bosom's solitude?” Be this as it may, her little earthly drama is concluded, and the curtain dropped. Her character was amiable, chaste, and correct—and for filial affection and domestic virtues, she has not left her equal—nor will the slightest blemish ever be discovered on the spotless purity of her fame. Whatever may have been her secret sorrows, she is now (I have no doubt) a happy angel in that permanent world of which this is but an imperfect shadow, like the broken image of a beautiful landscape reflected from the trembling surface of a troubled lake. “All, all on earth is shadow—all beyond Is substance; the reverse is folly's creed. How solid all where change shall be no more!” “Who can be ashamed to pay homage to a virtuous woman? It should be our ambition—our pride. She is the purest abstract of Deity that can be found in all his works. She is the image of love, of purity, and truth—and she lives and moves in the person of Amelia. “Woman ever has been, still is, and always will be, the main spring, the primum mobile of every masculine achievement, from the hero to the clown—from the man to the stripling; and whether she fire a Troy, or excite emulation in a game at marbles; whether she influence a court or rule in a dairy, the end, cause, and effect, are still the same. We may talk of Patriotism—we may prate of Fame; but who could feel the one, or seek the other, but for the sake of woman? “In every character WOMAN is interesting, though not always amiable—we may not love, but we must admire. Whether as the venerable matron, or the blooming maid; the chaste wife, or the affectionate mistress; the tender sister, or the blushing bride; old or young, married or unmarried, virtuous or vicious—still she will command our admiration, and influence our actions. “You will not condemn me for enthusiasm, for you are no stoic. I know that there are some hearts, cut by capricious Fate from the icy coagulations of the poles, or moulded from the frozen snow-drifts of Siberia, that are not susceptible of softening in the brightest rays that emanate from celestial beauty. There are such hearts—but let their possessors forbear to boast of them; they are the mere abortions of Nature—the eternal foes of genius; mere thistles and night-shade in the garden of creation. “For them no fancy consecrates the scene.” You know the rest of this beautiful passage in Campbell's `Pleasures of Hope,' ending thus: “And say, without our hopes, without our fears, “Without the home that plighted love endears; “Without the smile from partial beauty won; “O what were man? A world without a sun.” Blest with their smiles, this world becomes a heaven—without them, heaven itself would lose half its charms. O that you could have witnessed Amelia at the death-bed of Harriet Palmer! Never before did she appear so lovelyh in my eyes. Day after day, and night after night, has she watched by the pillow of her friend, administering 34* her medicine, sustaining her head on her bosom, and wiping the clammy dews of death from her sunken cheeks. O George, it is in such a scene that lovely woman shines, and until I saw your sister thus employed, I did not half appreciate the treasure I possess in that angel of humanity. Heaven grant me grace to be duly thankful for the gift. “Playful and artless, on the summer wave, Sporting with buoyant wing, the fairy scene With fairest grace adorning; but in wo, In poverty, in soul-subduing toils, In patient tending on the sick man's bed, In ministerings of love, in bitterest pangs, Faithful and firm;—in scenes where sterner hearts Have crack'd, still cheerful and still kind.” Our hero had scarcely finished reading this letter, when a lad entered his apartment, and advancing timidly forward, with a very modest deportment, inquired— “Is lieutenant Willoughby in want of an attendant, during the approaching campaign?” George (who was now folding a letter which he had written previous to receiving Morse's) was on the point of answering in the negative; but on contemplating the applicant a moment, he was struck with something peculiarly interesting in his melancholy countenance and diffident manners, which induced him to prolong the interview. He therefore asked him— “Who wants a situation in that capacity?” “Myself, sir;” replied the lad; “and if I am permitted to serve you, the gratitude I shall feel will always be a spur to my duty.” “Have you ever served as an officer's waiter?” “No, sir; but I feel fully competent to discharge the duties of one, and shall study diligently to become acquainted with them.” “I am much deceived,” replied George, “or you possess education and talents superior to the situation you are seeking. What then can be your object?” “I feel an enthusiastic predilection for a military life, sir, but am too young for a soldier. To be the personal attendant of a brave officer, during one campaign, will at once gratify my taste, and gradually initiate me into a profession I am determined to adopt. Will you employ me?” “How old are you?” “A little more than fourteen.” “What is your name?—Who are your parents?” “My name is Reuben, and I am an orphan. My education has been good, and my prospects in life were brilliant; I looked forward to nothing but happiness. A mercenary relation, however, under whose protection I was placed, actuated by motives of avarice only, bound me an apprentice to a trade I hated and a master I despised. With him, servitude was slavery, and I yet bear the marks of his cruelty on my person. I at length became wearied of existence, and determined to leave him; and he, suspecting my intention, watched me so very narrowly, that it was some time before I could elude his vigilance, and make my escape, which I at length effected in the night, and immediately set out for the army, determined to seek you, and solicit your protection.” “Why me?” asked George; “Do you know me?” “Only by reputation, sir,” answered Reuben; “though I have frequently seen you in Boston.” Our hero thought the countenance and voice were both familiar to him; but he could not recollect the person of the lad. It was very probable, however, that he had seen him in Boston. He surveyed him a moment in silence, and then asked— “What are your terms?” “Just such as you please to propose.” “I will employ you. When do you wish to commence?” “Immediately,” replied Reuben with alacrity, while his countenance brightened with a smile of pleasure. “To-day?” asked our hero. “This moment, if you please.” “Content. Take this note to the quarters of lieutenant Cooke, and leave it without waiting for an answer.” Reuben was overjoyed at his success, and expressed his gratitude and affection by kissing the hand from which he received the letter; then, making a graceful bow, he flew to execute his commission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Boston, March 21, 1813. “Another Naval Victory, my dear George, has rewarded the courage and enterprise of American sailors, and the name of Lawrence is now inscribed with those of Hull, Decatur, Jones, and Bainbridge, on an imperishable pillar of glory. “On the twenty-fourth day of February last, while cruising off Demarara, the American sloop of war Hornet, commanded by captain Lawrence, fell in with the British brig Peacock, captain Peake, and captured her, after a sanguinary action of fourteen minutes. The contest commenced within half pistol shot, and so tremendous was the fire of the Americans, that when she surrendered she was an absolute wreck, in a sinking condition, displaying a signal of distress. Notwithstanding every exertion was made to keep 34 her afloat until the prisoners could be removed, she sunk with thirteen of her crew, and three brave American tars, who thus nobly perished in relieving a conquered foe. “The slaughter on board of the Peacock was very severe; among the slain was found the body of her commander, captain Peake. He was twice wounded in the course of the action; the last wound proved fatal. His body was wrapped in the flag of his ship, and laid in the cabin to sink with her; a shroud and sepulchre worthy so brave a sailor. “It is a fact worthy of note, and in the highest degree honorable to our brave tars, that on the day succeeding the destruction of the Peacock, the crew of the Hornet made a subscription and supplied the prisoners (who had lost almost every thing) with two shirts and a jacket and trowsers each. “It is singular, that in this action, when the first broadsides were exchanged at half pistol shot, the pendant on the mainmast of the Hornet was shot away, one man was killed in the top, and the upper rigging much injured, but no mark of a ball was seen below the main-top. The Hornet's fire had quite a different effect on the Peacock; it was so well directed, that several of the shot pierced the hull of the Peacock through and through, killed a number of men, and, in a measure, decided the contest. “This victory (says a morning paper) will excite afresh the wonder of the world! The sinking the British sloop of war Peacock, by the United States sloop of war Hornet, in fifteen minutes, will fill England with amazement and dismay. The Peacock was as large a vessel as the Hornet, and carried more guns. To cut this ship to pieces, to kill and wound between thirty and forty of her men, while the American ship lost but one killed and two wounded, is a circumstance so extraordinary, that it impresses the minds of our countrymen with an exultation mixed with solemnity! Is it merely our prowess—or is it the finger of Heaven pointing to the path of our future glory? These successes fill not the mind with a noisy and giddy joy, but with a solemn and grateful sentiment towards that Power which controls the world, and giveth us the victory, by “teaching our hands to war, and our fingers to fight!” “But enough, for the present, of `blood stained glory.' Accompany me, for a few minutes, in the humbler walks of civil and domestic life, and let the subject of our contemplation be Woman, `Heaven's last, best gift to man.' Harriet Palmer, whose gentle manners, amiable disposition, and unassuming excellence, had secured her the love of all her acquaintance—has gone to taste the fruits of virtue in `another and a better world.' Amelia and myself have just returned from paying the last sad duties to her mortal part, which has just been committed to its kindred earth. Her affectionate parents are in the deepest affliction, having previously received some distressing intelligence respecting Sophia, who married the old German, in New-York, where she has since resided. I am ignorant of the particulars, but believe that the connexion is not productive of the promised felicity. It was a money match, and they are seldom happy. This circumstance, it is believed, hastened the death of Harriet— “Yet other secret griefs had she, “O pillow! only told to thee: “Say, did not hopeless love intrude “On her poor bosom's solitude?” Be this as it may, her little earthly drama is concluded, and the curtain dropped. Her character was amiable, chaste, and correct—and for filial affection and domestic virtues, she has not left her equal—nor will the slightest blemish ever be discovered on the spotless purity of her fame. Whatever may have been her secret sorrows, she is now (I have no doubt) a happy angel in that permanent world of which this is but an imperfect shadow, like the broken image of a beautiful landscape reflected from the trembling surface of a troubled lake. “All, all on earth is shadow—all beyond Is substance; the reverse is folly's creed. How solid all where change shall be no more!” “Who can be ashamed to pay homage to a virtuous woman? It should be our ambition—our pride. She is the purest abstract of Deity that can be found in all his works. She is the image of love, of purity, and truth—and she lives and moves in the person of Amelia. “Woman ever has been, still is, and always will be, the main spring, the primum mobile of every masculine achievement, from the hero to the clown—from the man to the stripling; and whether she fire a Troy, or excite emulation in a game at marbles; whether she influence a court or rule in a dairy, the end, cause, and effect, are still the same.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLV. THE ENEMY IN VIEW. There is a solemn hour, whose tremor dread May reach the heart, and not affect the head; But 'tis not when the ambush's loudest cry, In sudden onset, rolls along the sky; It comes not mid the battle's mingled roar, It comes, the silent interval before; When all the powers that solemnize the soul In awful calmness o'er the future roll; Survey with pain the unnatural strife of death, And count the victims doom'd to yield their breath: Behold the widow's tears that o'er them flow, And hear the helpless orphan's cry of wo. Smith's Heroes of the Lake. Every preparation was now completed, and the squadron being in readiness to transport the American troops across the lake to the enemy's country, they began to embark, at Sacket's Harbor, on Thursday the twenty-second day of April. This expedition was conducted by Dearborn, who had about seventeen hundred men under his command. The execution of that part of the plan which applied immediately to the attack upon York, was confided to general Pike, a gentleman who had recently been promoted, for his merits, from the rank of colonel to that of brigadier-general. Almost from his cradle, Pike had been trained to a military life, having entered the army while a boy, and served some time as a cadet in his father's company, then stationed on the western frontiers. At an early age he obtained the commission of ensign, and shortly after that of lieutenant of infantry. With no other education than such as is afforded by the most ordinary village school, he commenced his military career; but by his own industry and perseverance, without the aid of a teacher, he had acquired the Latin, French, and Spanish languages, and a competent knowledge of mathematics. At the age of twenty-two, he married the amiable Miss Clarissa Brown, of Cincinnati, and for several years afterwards reposed in the bosom of domestic felicity; panting, however, for an opportunity of gratifying his ruling passion, the love of a military life and a thirst for glory. One little circumstance which will tend to throw some light on the amiable character of this gallant officer, shall here be noticed. A short time after his marriage he presented his wife with a little pocket volume of the “Œconomy of Human Life,” in the blank pages of which he had been in the habit of inserting such maxims of morality, or sentiments of honor, as occurred in his reading, or were suggested by his own reflections. Among other articles of this description, was the following: “Should my country call for the sacrifice of that life which has been devoted to her service from early youth, most willingly shall she receive it. The sod which covers the brave, shall be moistened by the tears of love and friendship; but if I fall far from my friends and from you, my Clara, remember, that `the choicest tears which are ever shed, are those which bedew the unburied head of a soldier'—and when these lines shall meet the eyes of our young son, let the pages of this little book be impressed on his mind, as a gift of a father who had nothing to bequeath but his honor: and let these two short maxims be ever present to his mind, as he rises from youth to manhood: “1. Preserve your honor free from blemish. “2. Be always ready to die for your country.” When Pike had been married about four years, he was employed by government to explore the Mississippi to its source, which perilous expedition he commenced, with a few faithful and enterprising soldiers, and executed in eight months and twenty-two days; during which period the party were continually exposed to hardships and dangers—hunger and cold. He returned in April, one thousand eight hundred and six, having honorably accomplished every part of the trust confided to him. In the July following, he commenced a similar tour up the Missouri and Osage rivers; which he successfully accomplished, after much privation and suffering, in little less than twelve months; when he received the thanks of his government for these important services, and a rapid promotion in the army of his country. Having served through every gradation of rank, from a private to a general, and acquired reputation in each, he now possessed the full and entire confidence of his commander in chief, the love of the soldiers, and the respect of all ranks and classes of men. He was in the full vigor of life and health, of tried and approved courage, and intimately acquainted with all the minutæ of discipline. No wonder, that in such a man the discernment of Dearborn should discover every requisite of an able leader, admirably calculated to head the expedition he had undertaken. On the evening before the squadron sailed, Pike addressed an affectionate letter to his father, which contained the following sentences: “I embark to-morrow in a fleet from Sacket's Harbor, at the head of a column of fifteen hundred choice troops, on a secret expedition. If success attends my steps, honor and glory await my name—if defeat, still shall it be said we died like brave men, and conferred honor, even in death, on the American name. “Should I be the happy mortal destined to turn the scale of war, will not you rejoice, O my father? May Heaven be propitious and smile on the cause of my country! But if we are destined to fall, may my fall be like Wolf's—to sleep in the arms of victory.” Pike's principal aid, on this expedition, was ensign Fraser, a young gentleman whose name will be transmitted to posterity with honor, in every history of that war, the events of which I have here undertaken to record.[12] [12] The particular friend of Fraser, (alluded to in the note on page 107) was distinguished for his gallantry and patriotism on a very important occasion during the late war, as noticed in the proper place. His name is Bartholomew Delapierre. From the course of reading to which he had accustomed himself, he imbibed an early propensity for a military life, and had been lieutenant of a rifle company in Philadelphia, and an ensign in a corps of the same description in New-York, previous to his entering the regular army. At the age of twenty-one, he found his country involved in a contest for her rights, and, therefore, obtained an ensign's commission (in the regiment of which Pike was then colonel) that he might assist in chastising the haughty enemies of American freedom and independence. Here his zeal, and his attention to discipline, could not fail to attract the notice of his commander, who appointed him police-officer to the regiment, and complimented him highly in regimental orders. Pike afterwards selected him for his secretary, and on being promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, announced ensign Fraser as his aid-de-camp, and as such, he was now about to embark with his general on an important and hazardous expedition. Lieutenant Willoughby, having addressed a short letter to his father, and a long one to his Catharine, and having taken leave of his friends at the Harbor, went on board the fleet, on Saturday evening, the twenty-fourth of April, attended by his faithful and affectionate Reuben, to whom he had gradually become so strongly attached,that he now loved him as a brother, and treated him more like a companion than a servant. They set sail the next morning, with a fair wind, and soon lost sight of the American shore. On Monday evening, the town of Little-York appeared in view, when the squadron shortened sail, and laid to for the night. The plan of attack was formed by Pike himself, and clearly and minutely detailed in his general orders, which were directed to be read at the head of every corps; every field officer was also directed to carry a copy of them, in order that he might at any moment refer to them,and give an explanation to his subordinates. Every thing was arranged, and every probable exigency provided for, with admirable method and precision. 35 The following extract from these orders, breathes so much of the spirit of an American, that the reader will never regret its being inserted in this history: “No man will load until ordered, except the light troops in front, until within a short distance of the enemy, and then charge bayonets; thus letting the enemy see, that we can meet them with their own weapons. Any man firing or quitting his post without orders, must be put to instant death, as an example may be necessary. Platoon officers will pay the greatest attention to the coolness and aim of their men in the fire; their regularity and dressing in the charge. The field officers will watch over the conduct of the whole. Courage and bravery in the field do not more distinguish the soldier, than humanity after victory; and whatever example the savage allies of our enemies may have given us, the general confidently hopes, that the blood of an unresisting or yielding enemy, will never stain the weapons of the soldiers of his column. “The unoffending citizens of Canada are many of them our own countrymen, and the poor Canadians have been forced into the war. Their property, therefore, must be held sacred; and any soldier who shall so far neglect the honor of his profession as to be guilty of plundering the inhabitants, shall, if convicted, be punished with death. But the commanding general assures the troops, that should they capture a large quantity of public stores, he will use his best endeavors to procure them a reward from his government.” Every arrangement being completed, the approach of morning was awaited in the most anxious suspense. How many in this little fleet were to see the rising sun, who were never to behold it set! How many were now gazing at the spangled firmament of heaven, whose eyes were to be soon forever closed on all material things! Such reflections could never disgrace a hero, and such reflections were indulged by the veteran Dearborn, the valiant Pike, the intrepid Fraser, the gallant Willoughby, and many other brave spirits, who were gazing on the shore which was so soon to be drenched with the mingled blood of friends and foes. Our hero, who felt no inclination to quit the deck, was awakened from a profound reverie, by a deep-drawn sigh, succeeded by half-stifled sobs; and advancing to the spot from whence the sounds proceeded, he found Reuben, leaning over the vessel's side, and dimpling the waves with his tears. He was evidently embarrassed at his master's approach, and endeavored to conceal his disorder. “Not drooping, I hope?” inquired George, with an affectionate tone, at the same time taking his hand. “Cheer up, my lad, and think of the glory that awaits us to-morrow!” Reuben found it difficult to return any answer, without betraying an agitation he would gladly have concealed. At length, however, he assumed sufficient composure to reply— “Think not, my dear sir, that I feel any fear on my own account; but, oh, sir, if the result of to-morrow's engagement should deprive me of your friendship and protection, what would become of me?” “It is not wise, Reuben, to anticipate evil, but to meet it like a man when it comes; who would capitulate to a distant enemy? It is certainly soon enough when he demands a surrender. If I should fall, to-morrow, we shall be a short time separated; but while you are virtuous you will never want for a friend or protector—God will be your friend—what evil can then befall you?” “I cannot dispute your observations,” replied Reuben, “but it affords me no consolation. I know of no friend but you, and I would so repine to lose you, that I should forfeit all claims to the friendship and protection of Heaven.” “Come, come, my little friend,” replied our hero, “banish despondency, and trust to Providence for the event of our present enterprise. Recollect that you have chosen the profession of arms, and the soldier “who doubts, is damned.” There are only two classes of soldiers who can ever be useful to their country—they who confide solely in Providence, and they who place all confidence in themselves. The former fight from a sense of duty--the latter from a thirst of fame or the meaner passions of revenge, hatred, or gain. The former are always serene, cool, deliberate, and collected; the same in victory or defeat, in success or disaster, in life or death. The latter are demons in battle, tyrants in victory, blasphemers in defeat, and cowards in death. The former know and acknowledge that the result of every contest will be ordered by Heaven for the best— the latter think that no result can be good but what tends to the gratification of their own selfish wishes. The former are ever ready, the latter ever eager to be led to the fray. Both fight well, but from very different motives. To one of these classes, must my Reuben belong, if he ever acquires military fame; for all others are negative soldiers, lukewarm cowards, that only disgrace an army and retard its operations. Let me entreat you to study faithfully the two characters I have mentioned, and choose the former for your model. Begin the lesson now, by convincing yourself, as you easily can, from reason and Scripture, that the “Judge of all the earth does right,” and that not even a sparrow can fall to the ground without the permission of that Being who permits nothing (not even evil) but for the promotion of ultimate good. We ought, therefore, to feel proud that the death of such insignificant beings as we are, can be instrumental of furthering the plans of Providence, the object and end of which is the good of his creatures.” While this conversation was passing between our hero and his timid young friend, Fraser was receiving from his general a private and delicate commission. It was a sealed letter, with this injunction—“Neither of us can foresee the fate of to-morrow's contest; therefore, should I fall, and you survive, hand this yourself to Mrs. Pike.” Fraser received the sacred trust, and Pike resumed the examination of a map which was spread on the table before him. The letter which he had thus entrusted to the care of his aid, had just been written, and the exercise had in some measure lightened a sullen weight that hung upon his mind—a painful presentiment of evil, which all the busy arrangements of the evening had not tended to dissipate. It was addressed to his wife, and the following is a literal transcript of the original copy: 35* “My dear Clara, “We are now standing on and off the harbor of York, which we shall attack at day-light in the morning. I shall dedicate these last moments to you, my love, and to-morrow throw all other ideas but my country to the winds. As yet I know not if general Dearborn lands; he has acted honorably so far, and I feel great gratitude to the old gentleman: my sword and pen shall both be exerted to do him honor. I have no new injunction—no new charge to give you; nor any new idea to communicate; yet we love to commune with those we love, more especially when we conceive it may be the last time in this world. Should I fall, defend my memory: and only believe, had I lived, I would have aspired to deeds worthy of your husband. Remember me with a father's love—a father's care, to our dear daughter, and believe me to be, with the warmest sentiments of love and friendship, your MONTGOMERY.” “Heaven avert so disastrous an event!” silently ejaculated Fraser, as he consigned the letter to his pocket-book; “and when I take it hence, may it be to return it into the writer's victorious hand. If I fall”—he thought of his parents—brother—friend. [13] [13] Every circumstance recorded in these pages respecting this gallant young officer, is copied from a biographical sketch, handed me by one of his most intimate friends and companions, who, having fought by his side, was a witness of his valor, and is desirous of having it placed on permanent record. The author, in speaking of Fraser, has endeavored to adopt such a style as he conceived would be least likely to give offence to the delicacy of a friend, who shuns ostentation, and whose modesty is almost equal to his courage. Major Fraser is a native of the city of New-York. See note at the end of this chapter.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVI. SUCCESSFUL INVASION. But the horrors of that fight, Were the weeping muse to tell; O'twould cleave the womb of night, And awake the dead that fell. Then the mighty pour'd their breath, Slaughter feasted on the brave, 'Twas the carnival of Death! 'Twas the vintage of the grave. Montgomery. The approach of the American fleet had been discovered by the watchful enemy, and at day-light the shore was lined with armed troops (British and Indians) to receive their invaders. The wind was so high that the fleet could not assume such a position as to cover the landing, and the Americans had to approach the shore in boats, exposed to a shower of musket-balls and leaden slugs, which fell like hail around them, lashing the lake into a frightful foam. The youthful hero who had so long been the scourage of the Canadian border, the daring Forsyth, with his well-tried corps of riflemen, led the advance, in batteaux. They pulled vigorously towards the “point proposed,” but were forced by the wind to a considerable distance above it. The enemy were masked by a thick copse, within a few feet of the water, and their fire was galling and incessant. Forsyth, therefore, desired his men to rest a moment on their oars, while his riflemen returned the shot. Pike was at this moment standing on the ship's deck, hurrying the infantry into the boats; when observing the pause in the advance, he leaped into his barge, accompanied by Fraser, Willoughby, and the officers of his staff; and ordering three companies to follow him instantly, under major King,[14] [14] King had previously distinguished himself in one of Smyth's partial invasions of the enemy's country, opposite Black-Rock, on the Niagara river, on the twenty-eighth day of November, preceding, where success and glory would have attended the American arms had King been properly supported. As it was, with a little band of followers he stormed the enemy's principal battery, and after a desperate battle with three times their number, drove the enemy from the field. In the mean time, colonel Boerstler, a very brave officer, attacked and dispersed the enemy, lower down the river, and every battery between Chippewa and Fort Erie was soon carried, and the cannon spiked or destroyed. Smyth would not permit the army to cross, and King was captured. was himself rowed into the thickest of the fire, from which Willoughby received a slight wound in the hand. Reuben was ordered to remain on board, and stood watching the departure of his friend with the most painful solicitude. Before Pike could reach the shore, Forsyth had effected a landing, and was hotly engaged with a host of British and Indians, (under the immediate command of general Sheaffe) who were disputing the possession of a high bank a short distance from the beach, which the Americans were determined to ascend, in the face of a torrent of death which was poured down upon them from muskets and rifles. The remainder of the Americans now landed in rapid succession, and, as soon as they were formed in order of battle, were gallantly led to the charge by Pike himself. The shock was not to be withstood—the British grenadiers gave way, and retired in disorder, while the Americans gained the summit of the bank, and were soon masters of the field. The bugles of Forsyth sounded the signal of victory, and the Indians, sending forth a horrid yell of dismay, fled in every direction. The British, however, with their accustomed bravery and cool intrepidity, again rallied, and presented a new front; but, after an obstinate resistance, were compelled to retire within their fortifications. These fortifications were to be taken by storm, and for this purpose the column advanced towards them with as much velocity as the streams and ravines (which intersected the road) would permit. After a slight resistance, the English abandoned their first battery, and retired to the second, and soon after retreated to the citadel or garrison. Pike had ordered Fraser to proceed to the right of the battery, in order to discover how many men were in the works. He had performed this service, and now reported the number to his general, and that they were spiking their guns. Pike immediately ordered captain Walworth, with his company of grenadiers, to make the assault, when the enemy fled in the utmost confusion, leaving several of their wounded comrades on the ground. The firing had now ceased on all sides, and the victors were momentarily expecting a flag of surrender from the citadel, when its magazine was blown into the air with an explosion so stupendous and awful, as appalled the stoutest heart! The earth apparently shook to its centre, and the air was darkened with the flying fragments of earth, stone, and broken iron, descending in dreadful ruin on the devoted heads of the victorious column. Pike had just aided in removing a wounded man to a safer position, and was at this moment questioning a British sergeant, (who had been captured) on the position and strength of the enemy.[15] [15] The conversation which on this occasion took place between general Pike and the prisoner, is worthy of being recorded. I regret that it is not in my power to announce the name of so brave an Englishman to his countrymen. This prisoner was a British sergeant, had been slightly wounded in the shoulder by a rifle ball, and was sent by major Forsyth to the general, who thus accosted him: Pike. Who commands your troops? Prisoner. Sir Roger Hall Sheaffe. Pike. Where is the main body of your army? Prisoner. There—there—there—(pointing in different directions, to evade a direct answer.) Pike. (impatiently) What is your whole strength, and where are the regulars? Prisoner. Sir, I am a British soldier! (placing his right hand on his breast, and intimating by his manner that he would give no information.) Pike. You are a brave fellow—(and was about to proceed, when the explosion took place, which proved fatal both to the examiner and examined.) He was seated on a stump, with the prisoner before him, Fraser on one side, and captain Nicholson (his volunteer aid) on the other, when the explosion took place, and the group were precipitated like lightning to the earth. The English sergeant breathed no more, a large stone having struck him on the head, and his corpulent body was so forcibly thrown upon Fraser, that the latter lay crushed beneath him, severely bruised, and for a time unable to move. Pike and Nicholson were mortally wounded. Sensible that he should survive but a short time, Pike faintly exclaimed, “Push on my brave fellows, and avenge your general!” The troops replied with three cheers, and rushed like bloodhounds upon their prey. Pike and his wounded aids were immediately removed from the field, but had not proceeded far towards the shore, when their ears were saluted by a tremendous shout. Pike turned an inquiring look to one of his supporters, who replied—“The British unionjack is coming down, general; the stars are going up!” He heaved a sigh of extacy, and smiled amidst the anguish of his wounds. Shortly after he had arrived on board the commodore's ship, the trophy of his victory, the British flag, was brought into his cabin, when he made a sign to have it placed under his head, and expired without a groan—literally reposing on the pillow of victory. In the mean time, the command on shore devolved on colonel Pearce, who was pushing rapidly forward from the ruins of the citadel, (on which the American banner was now flying) towards the town, when he was met by several British officers, with terms of capitulation. During the discussion of these terms, (which was purposely prolonged by the proposers) general Sheaffe was employed in destroying all the military stores, and the new ship on the stocks, which was nearly ready for launching—removed whatever could be easily transported, and then effected his escape with all his regulars, contrary to the articles of capitulation, which considered them and him prisoners of war. At four o'clock in the afternoon the Americans were in possession of the town, and reviewed by Dearborn, who had landed immediately after the unfortunate explosion. It was now fully ascertained that the explosion at the citadel was not the result of accident, as many had at first imagined. It was a deep-laid plan (contrived by an enemy who had shrunk from an inferior force in the open field) to destroy the army he had vainly though bravely opposed. Had not Pike fortunately halted at the second battery, the horrid contrivance would have succeeded to the extent of its projector's wishes; the whole column must have been destroyed. Five hundred barrels of powder, a vast number of large stones, an immense quantity of iron shells and shot, and a great variety of destructive combustibles, were arranged for the purpose; the train was skilfully laid, and the whole so contrived as to produce the most dreadful effect. Two hundred and sixty Americans were either killed or wounded by the explosion, among whom were many officers of high rank and exalted worth. About sixty of the enemy were also involved in the same terrible fate. Fraser had been severely bruised in the general crash, and was probably preserved by the corpulency of the British sergeant, whose body was thrown upon him, and became a shield to screen him from the deluge of ruin which was poured upon the whole group. Such was the instrumental cause by which was preserved an existence so useful to his country—so dear to patriotism—so precious to friendship. Lieutenant Willoughby had not escaped, but received a severe contusion in the breast, which disabled him for the rest of the action, and he was conveyed on board the fleet, when the sight of his wound almost deprived the tender-hearted Reuben of all sensation. His affection, however, enabled him to subdue his terrors, and officiate as nurse; his tender assiduities and unwearied attention were finally crowned with success, and he again beheld in health the master he loved—the friend he almost adored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVII. FURTHER SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS. To arms again our heroes fly, And, leading on their lines, Columbia's banner, in the sky, The star of conquest shines. Montgomery---altered. On the first day of May, Dearborn's victorious army evacuated York, and embarked on board the fleet; and on the eighth, set sail for the American shore. Having another expedition in contemplation, the vicinity of Fort Niagara, near the head of the lake, was pitched upon as the most eligible position for making the necessary arrangements; to that place the squadron, therefore, proceeded, where the troops were landed, when part of the fleet was ordered to Sacket's Harbor for reinforcements. The intrepid Scott, who was made a prisoner at Queenston, had been lately exchanged, and now joined Dearborn, in capacity of adjutant-general to the northern army. Having procured the necessary reinforcements, which increased his army to near five thousand men, Dearborn determined on attempting the reduction of the peninsula on the opposite side of the straits, where was situated a strong fortress called Fort George. The necessary arrangements were all completed on the twenty-sixth of May, and on the following night, at one o'clock, the whole army embarked, on Lake Ontario, about three miles east of Fort Niagara. It was arranged in six divisions of boats; the first of which contained the advance guard, under colonel Scott, who was specially selected for this command. 36 This was followed by colonel Porter, with the field train, the brigades of Boyd, Winder, and Chandler, and a reserve under colonel M`Comb. On the preceding day Chauncey had reconnoitred the position for landing the troops; he sounded the shore in the night, and placed buoys to mark the stations of the small vessels. Captain Perry (who, for some months, had been employed at Erie, in superintending the building and equipping vessels for the service of that lake, to the command of which he had been appointed) arrived in the vicinity of Fort Niagara, to procure seamen for his squadron, just as the army were about to embark on their present expedition. He immediately volunteered his services, which were promptly accepted by Dearborn and Chauncey, who cheerfully confided to his management the conducting of the divisions, which was an operation of some difficulty, in consequence of the winds and a strong current, together with the tremendous fire of the enemy. In the discharge of this duty, Perry was present at every point where he could be useful, under showers of musketry, and rendered very essential services to the advance guard, which he accompanied nearly to its point of attack. The squadron took a position to open their fire upon the British batteries, while a heavy discharge from Fort Niagara was also directed against them. In ten minutes they were nearly all silenced, and soon after abandoned by the enemy. Scott effected his landing in good order, near one of the silenced forts, under a severe and galling fire of musketry, which was poured upon him from a high bank like a parapet, on which the English stood to receive their invaders. Scott formed his line on the beach, and then gallantly scaled the bank (fifteen feet in height) against a row of fifteen hundred bayonets which fringed its summit. The assault was brisk and vigorous, but twice repeated without success. At this moment, Boyd landed with his brigade, and the united troops advanced with such determined bravery, that the enemy gave way, and the bank was occupied by the Americans. Boyd was the senior officer on shore, and as such commanded both brigades. He was the first man who reached the top of the bank, where he proclaimed his success by three cheers. In a few minutes, however, the British rallied, and returned to the charge, when a most desperate and destructive conflict ensued, which continued for about fifteen minutes, and terminated in the total rout of the enemy at every point, who, during their retreat, were exposed to a tremendous shower of grape and canister from the squadron. Above one hundred of them bit the dust on the summit of the bank. The retreating foe was closely pursued for above five miles up the river, and the greater part of them would have probably been made prisoners, had not the light troops under colonel Scott and colonel Miller, been injudiciously called in from the pursuit, and for the second time, permitted a beaten enemy to escape from their conquerors. As the Americans advanced towards Fort George, (the bulwark of the peninsula) it was perceived that the garrison were in the act of abandoning it, the shot from Fort Niagara being so accurately thrown as to render it untenable. Two companies were immediately ordered forward to prevent this movement, who succeeded in making several prisoners, but the rest escaped. When within eighty paces of the abandoned fort, one of its magazines was blown up with a tremendous explosion. The front gate was instantly forced, and Scott was the first to enter, and with his own hands struck the British flag which was yet waving on the works. Trains had been laid by the retreating garrison to three other magazines, and the matches were almost burnt to the fatal mark, when the Americans entered the fort. Lieutenant Willoughby (who entered the gate with captains Hindman and Stockton, immediately behind Scott) sprang forward and snatched one of the matches from the train, while the other two were with equal alacrity secured by Hindman and Stockton; thus by the coolness and presence of mind of these gallant officers, the lives of many hundreds were saved, and a formidable fortress preserved from destruction. The British loss of regular soldiers, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, was three hundred and eighty-six, and five hundred militia prisoners, who were paroled, making their total loss amount to eight hundred and eighty-six. Colonel Myers, who commanded them, was wounded and taken prisoner. The American loss in killed and wounded was one hundred and fifty. Among the champions of freedom who particularly distinguished themselves on this occasion, posterity will meet the names of Boyd, Scott, Winder, Lewis, M`Clure, M`Comb, Chandler, Fraser, (now Chandler's aid) Willoughby, Porter, Armistead, Forsyth, Riddle, Hindman, Totten,Stockton, King, Arrowsmith, Steel, Roach, and Swearingen, of whom the five last were wounded. Among the heroes attached to the squadron, it is but just to mention, after their gallant commander, lieutenants Macpherson, Brown, Pettigrew, Smith, Osgood, Trant, Mix, and Stevens. Chauncey was indefatigable in his co-operations with the army, in all its important movements, and much of that day's success and glory is attributable to his judicious plans and unremitting exertions in their execution. On the day after the battle, Perry departed for Lake Erie, taking with him fifty seamen for his little squadron on those waters. Two brigs had been launched at Erie, and two or three small schooners had been purchased for the service. His present object was to take his fifty seamen to Black Rock, to take five vessels from the river Niagara into the lake. Previous to his departure, however, he had an interview with our hero, when a reciprocal relation of adventures took place, to the mutual satisfaction of both the young heroes. Perry had, it seems, become weary of commanding gun-boats; for his enterprising and active mind required a less contracted theatre for the exercise of his aspiring talents. Every situation will become irksome to a brave man which affords no opportunity of being useful to his country, or of acquiring honor to himself. Perry, therefore, applied to the navy department for an appointment on the Lakes, and the application was successful.[16] [16] See Analetic Magazine and Port Folio. So attached to him were the brave tars of his gun-boat squadron, that they cheerfully volunteered to follow his new fortunes, and accompany him to the lakes. In a few days he was ready to depart, and tearing himself from the comforts of home, and the 36* endearments of a young and beautiful wife and blooming child, he set off with his generous and hardy followers, on his expedition to the wilderness. The rivers being completely frozen over, they were obliged to perform the journey by land, in the depth of winter. The greatest order and good humor, however, prevailed throughout the little band of adventurers, to whom the whole expedition seemed a kind of frolic, and who were delighted with what they termed a land cruise. He proceeded, with his men, to Sacket's Harbor, and reported himself to Chauncey, who immediately detached him to Lake Erie, to take the command of the squadron on that station, and to superintend the building of additional vessels. The British, at this time, held the entire and exclusive possession of this lake, and to Perry was confided the important duty of creating a fleet, in the face of a proud and insolent foe. He had not only to contemplate the day as extremely dubious and distant when he should meet his enemy on fair and honorable terms on the bosom of the lake, but likewise to guard against surprise, and run the risk of having his navy destroyed on the stocks. But to a mind like his, obstacles only added ardor and excited perseverance—he was determined to succeed. Perry and Willoughby parted with mutual regret, both sincerely wishing that they had been destined to serve their country on the same element. On the day following the capture of Fort George, Dearborn received information that the retreating enemy had made a stand at a place called Beaver Dams, about eight miles from Queenston; he therefore immediately ordered general Lewis to march to that place with Chandler's and Winder's brigades, the light artillery, dragoons and riflemen, to cut off their retreat. The English, however, although considerably reinforced, would not risk another battle, but broke up their encampment on the approach of the Americans, and fled with precipitation along the mountains, towards Lake Ontario. Lewis moved on, and took possession of every British post between Fort George and Fort Erie, the latter of which had been abandoned by the panic-struck enemy, and was now occupied by lieutenant-colonel Preston. Thus the whole peninsula between the two lakes was brought under the controul of the Americans, and the navigation of Niagara river secured to their vessels. An important preliminary step to the operations of Perry. Finding no enemy to contend with, Lewis returned to Fort George; but intelligence had reached Dearborn that Proctor's army was on a rapid march from the Northwest to join that of Vincent, and retrieve the misfortunes of the British arms; he therefore ordered Winder and Chandler to proceed with their brigades towards Burlington Bay, (the most western point of Lake Ontario) in order to prevent a junction of the British generals. Vincent had already made a stand on Burlington Heights, about fifty miles from Fort George, when these two brigades encamped in his vicinity. The chief command of the Americans on this expedition had been assigned to Chandler, and the whole encamped, on the evening of the fifth of June, at a place called Stony Creek. A little after midnight, captain Van Vechten, who commanded the advance guard, was alarmed by several deep groans near him, as of a person in the agonies of death, but before he had time to form a conjecture on the subject, his guard was surrounded by the British, and the whole with himself made prisoners. The enemy had approached in the most profound silence, effectually screened by the darkness of the night; had despatched the sentinels with their bayonets, and now seizing five pieces of light artillery, instantly turned them upon the encampment, before any alarm could be given, and poured their contents in among the sleeping troops. A scene of dreadful confusion ensued, the halfwaked Americans not being able to distinguish friends from foes, but desperately assailed each other in the dark. Not being aware that the artillery in front was in the hands of the British, Chandler and Winder flew to the battery to change the direction of its fire, and were both made prisoners. Of this event the other officers were ignorant, and every one chose his own plan of resisting the assailants, not knowing where to look for orders. Towson's artillery was stationed more in the rear, and he now opened its fire on the enemy with such effect that the confusion and dismay was suddenly transferred from the American to the British ranks. This gallant officer was soon supported by spirits born to conquer; Hindman, Nicholas, Burn, Milton, Steele, Willoughby, Chrystie, Eldridge, Fraser, Biddle, Archer, M`Chesney, M`Donough, Armstrong, Riddle, and others as brave, carried death in every direction. Their fire was irresistible. The enemy were dispersed at all points, but again returned to the contest. Several desperate attempts were made to retake the artillery, but without success; till, at length, lieutenant M`Chesney (with a gallantry that will immortalize his name) dashed into the thickest of the enemy, hewed a bloody path to the nearest piece, and succeeded in restoring it to the original possessors. His bravery also saved several other pieces from falling into the enemy's power. The dawn of day now enabled the troops to distinguish each other, when colonel Burn took command of the Americans, and proceeded to form the yet disordered line, the conflict still continuing with the most desperate fury on both sides. “Never rose the astonished sun “On so obstinate a fight.” The American dragoons at length made a tremendous and effectual assault—the enemy could not withstand the impetuosity of the charge, but broke and fled in every direction. Their commanding officer was missing some time before, and was not found by his troops until the following day, when he was discovered about four miles from the scene of action, destitute of a hat, without a horse, and almost famished. During the retreat of the British, lieutenant M`Donough very gallantly recovered another field-piece, which they were attempting to carry off with them. The total loss of the Americans in this affair, (which was trifling in comparison with that of the British) was one hundred and fifty-four, including killed, wounded, and missing, while the British missing alone must have been nearly equal to that number, as above a hundred of them were sent as prisoners to Fort George. Fraser (who acted as aid to Chandler) was slightly wounded, and narrowly escaped sharing the captivity of his general. On the second day after the battle, as the army were encamped on the borders of the lake, about ten miles from the scene of action, (where they had been joined by Boyd and Lewis, the latter having the command) they were summoned to surrender by Sir James Yeo, the commander of the British squadron, which had arrived in the night, and was now stationed abreast of the encampment, within a mile of the shore. No notice was taken of this insolent demand, and as Dearborn had sent an express to recall the troops to Fort George, Lewis prepared to retire in obedience to this order, and the army returned accordingly. While these transactions were passing in the enemy's territory, an event of some importance occurred on the American shore of Ontario. The defenceless state in which Sacket's Harbor was necessarily left, (by employing the army and the squadron in the foregoing expedition) induced the British to attempt its reduction, and thereby secure to themselves the mastery of the Lake. Dearborn was apprised of this intention, and therefore wrote to general Brown, requesting him to repair immediately to that important post, with as much militia force as he could collect, and assume the command there.[17] [17] See Analetic Magazine, vol. v, p. 294. Brown, knowing that colonel Backus, a regular officer of character and experience, was then in command at that place, at first hesitated. But the request being again repeated, and urged by Backus himself, he finally yielded, and immediately set out for that post, where he arrived with a small body of militia early on the morning of Friday the twenty-eighth day of May. At day-break, the next morning, Sir George Provost landed at the head of one thousand picked men, under cover of a heavy fire from his gun-boats. Brown, depending chiefly upon the well known superiority of the American musketry, had posted five hundred of his militia to receive the enemy on their landing, with orders that they should lie close, and reserve their fire until the enemy had approached so nigh that every shot might hit its object. But the trepidation and confusion of the moment excited one of those sudden panics to which undisciplined volunteers are so subject, and the whole line fired at the very instant of the enemy's landing, and then fled in disorder. Brown threw himself among them to stop their flight, and having rallied about a hundred men, he gained a position on the enemy's left flank, and harassed them by a galling fire, by which they were held in check, until they were met by the regular troops under colonel Backus. Brown now hurried to this point of action, and found the gallant Backus dangerously wounded, and the battle still raging, but with very evident advantage on the American side. After a short conflict he was completely victorious, and Prevost retreated rapidly to his ships, leaving a number of men and several officers killed and wounded on the field. On the first of June Chauncey returned to Sacket's Harbor with the squadron, and Brown once more retired to his farm and ordinary occupation. But his military reputation was now established, and public expectation was anxiously turned towards him as one to whom the fortunes and honor of the American arms might be confidently entrusted; all wishing that his rank was in the regular army instead of the militia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVIII. THE JOURNAL. An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told. Shakspeare. During the foregoing operations, Dearborn was very severely indisposed, being a great part of the time confined to his bed, from whence he issued his orders. His indisposition had now increased to such an alarming degree, that he found himself totally unfit for active duty, and therefore resigned his command, and sought that peaceful retirement which was more fitted to his advanced years and war-worn constitution. General Lewis had repaired to Sacket's Harbor, to act in concert with Chauncey, and the command of the American army in Canada therefore devolved on the hero to whose military skill and personal gallantry the possession of the British Peninsula was principally owing. I mean the gallant Boyd, whose exalted worth and pre-eminent services have not (from some unaccountable fatality) received the reward they so richly merit. Partiality or prejudice have precipitately placed unfading chaplets on less-deserving brows; but the steady and unerring hand of Truth shall yet inscribe the name of Boyd on the brightest column in the temple of Fame. Blind to his superior merits, notwithstanding their recent brilliant display, the secretary of war affected to consider him merely as a substitute for a more able commander; and at once placed a veto on any future exhibition of his talents, by forbidding him to engage the enemy, if possible to avoid it.[18] [18] The following is the copy of a letter from the Secretary of War to general Boyd—from which the above inference can be fairly drawn: War Department, July 7, 1813. Sir—General Dearborn being about to withdraw from the command of the army, until his health shall be re-established, this trust will devolve upon you, as the senior officer, until the arrival of some person to whom it will be specially assigned. During this period, you will pay the utmost attention to the instruction and discipline of the troops, and engage in no affair with the enemy, that can be avoided. The orders of Generals Hampton and Lewis, you will obey. I am, sir, with great respect, your most obedient servant, JOHN ARMSTRONG. Brig. Gen. Jno. P. Boyd, Fort George. Many other disadvantages attended his command; Dearborn and Lewis had never seen fit to consult a subaltern, and Boyd was, consequently, destitute of any information relative to the campaign. Still, however, he was determined to discharge his duty, as far as his superiors would condescend to entrust him with a knowledge of it, and leave the result to Providence. While he could be useful to his country, he was resolved that no personal motives should induce him to abandon her cause. The American force in Canada was now daily diminishing by sickness, and surprises, while that of the enemy was rapidly increasing by reinforcements of regulars, militia, and Indians. Five hundred American infantry and twenty light dragoons, under the command of colonel Boerstler, together with forty-four mounted riflemen, under major Chapin, had been surprised on their march from Fort George to Beaver Dams, by a combined force of British and Indians, who lay concealed in the woods near the road they were passing. The contest was maintained with great bravery for some time, but terminated in the surrender of the 37 Americans. As a division of the prisoners were conducted towards Kingston by water, the daring Chapin resolved on effecting his escape, which he did, (with twenty-eight men, and two boats) by disarming the guard, consisting of sixteen men, and making them prisoners. They arrived at Fort Niagara in safety on the thirteenth of July. Many of the officers at Fort George were so severely indisposed as to be unfit for duty, and disease was making serious havoc in the ranks. Lieutenant Willoughby had been for several days under the doctor's care, and nursed by the attentive and faithful Reuben, but was now so far recovered as to be able to write, and accordingly devoted the eleventh of July to that employment —bringing up his journal to that date. In recording the events of that horrible night in which the camp of Chandler had been surprised, he gave a loose to his poetic fancy, and inserted the following song, which I have thought proper to copy: THE BUGLE. Deep murmuring down the lonely dell, The dull tattoo, with drowsy swell, Had bid the march-worn soldier rest, With armor buckled on his breast. But, hark! what cry alarms? The foe at hand!—to arms! And, darting from the ground, The slumbering veterans bound, While the Bugle sounds the CHARGE, rousing echo with the sound. And now the cannon's sullen roar Deep rolls along Ontario's shore, While Freedom's sons surprised remain, Their watch-word stole—their pickets slain. In vain the trump alarms, In vain the cry, to arms! The foe from ambush springs, Their yell the welkin rings, While the Bugle sounds RETREAT, adding speed to terror's wings. Shall Freedom's veterans fly the field, Her heroes shrink—her chieftains yield? Say, where's the spirit of the brave Who bled, Columbia's rights to save? It lives! it breathes! it warms! Roused by the clash of arms, Vengeance, with eye of flame, Fires with a love of fame, While the Bugle sounds the RALLY, until victory we claim. Having completed his task, and still having time and inclination to continue the employment, he sincerely regretted that the lengthened silence of his correspondents had left many chasms to fill up in his journal; but while he was expressing this regret to Reuben, a sergeant entered and handed him a packet of letters which had just been received at the encampment (among many others) by a vessel which had arrived with hospital stores; these letters contained the very particulars he desired. One of them was from his father, another from Morse, two others from his correspondents at Washington, a fifth from Norfolk, and a sixth from New-York. Although I have permission, I do not deem it necessary to lay all or any of these letters before my readers. The following is a brief synopsis of their contents, as journalized by our hero himself. March 4, 1813. James Madison, who has been elected President of the United States for a second term of four years, was this day installed according to law, at the capitol, in the city of Washington, in presence of both houses of Congress, and a vast concourse of spectators. Congress adjourned, to meet again on the twenty-fourth day of May. March 8. The emperor of Russia, through his ministers, has offered to the United States and Great Britain, his mediation, with a view to promote peace between the two countries. A communication to this effect has been received by the American government, and the proposition cordially acceded to. Ambassadors are to be immediately appointed to proceed to Europe for the purpose of commencing the negociation with others appointed by Great Britain. March 11. The privateer general Armstrong, captain Champlin, had a long and sanguinary engagement with a British frigate, and finally effected her escape, after being much cut up in sails and rigging, and having seven killed and sixteen wounded. A great many Englishmen were killed, and thrown overboard in sight of the Americans. March 20. Commodore Beresford, of the British blockading squadron in the river Delaware, made an insolent demand on the chief magistrate of Lewis, a small town on the river bank, for twenty live bullocks, with a proportionate quantity of vegetables and hay, for the use of his Britannic majesty's squadron. This demand was promptly and spiritedly refused, notwithstanding the commodore's threat of destroying the town in case of a refusal. April 6. Beresford commenced an attack on Lewis, and then renewed his demand, expressing his grief for the fate of the women and children in case he should be compelled to destroy the town. The reply was very laconic—“Colonel Davis is a gallant man, and has already taken care of the ladies.” The attack was immediately renewed, and continued for twenty hours, during which time upwards of six hundred shot, shells, and Congreve rockets, were discharged from the squadron. The shells did not reach the town, the rockets passed over it, and the shot did but little damage; and so the affair ended. April 26. Fort Meigs was on this day closely invested by an immense force of British and Indians. Harrison had been expecting this event, and had used every exertion to put the fort in the best possible state of defence. On the appearance of the enemy he dispatched an express to general Clay, of Kentucky, who arrived with his brigade on the ninth day of May to relieve the garrison; when a desperate battle took place, in which colonel Dudley's detachment drove all before them; until, led on by an impetuous ardor in pursuing the retreating foe, they were drawn into the woods, where an ambuscade surprised and destroyed nearly the whole detachment. The remainder of the brigade, seconded by a sortie from the fort, carried the enemy's works, spiked his cannon, and compelled him to raise the siege, which had continued thirteen days. During this period, eighteen hundred shells and cannon balls had been thrown into the fort, and a continual discharge of small arms had been kept up; yet the American loss was only eighty-one killed, and one hundred and eighty-nine wounded, a great proportion of which occurred in the sortie of the last day. Dudley's body was found shockingly 37* mangled by the savages. Among the Americans who signalized themselves on this occasion, were colonel Miller, majors Ball, Alexander, Todd, Sodwick, Ritzer, and Johnson; captains Wood, Croghan, Hamilton, Langhan, Bradford, and Nearing; lieutenants Gwynne and Campbell. May 3. Havre-de-Grace, a small town on the Susquehannah river, near its junction with the waters of the Chesapeake, was bombarded by the British, the houses burnt, and the inhabitants plundered. On this occasion, an old citizen, named O'Neill, signalized himself by his courage and perseverance. He was at length taken prisoner, and detained several days, but finally given up on demand of the magistrates of that place. This burning and robbing excursion was conducted by admiral Cockburn in person, who permitted his followers to commit the most wanton excesses without restraint. Horses were killed, carriages demolished, furniture destroyed, church-windows broken, and every dwelling house burnt except one, to which all the terrified women and children had fled for shelter. Thus these peaceful and defenceless villagers were left without houses, property, or clothes—the men abused—the females insulted—every one plundered! How different the Americans! Were there a wretch in the army which now occupies the British Peninsula in Canada, base enough to plunder the defenceless inhabitants, he would expiate the offence with his life. May 16. The ship Neptune sailed from New-Castle, having on board the embassy to Russia, and their suite. They carry with them the news of the capture of York, which, it is apprehended, will be as efficient in the negociation as any thing they can take out. May 24. The frigate United States, commodore Decatur; frigate Macedonian, captain Jones; and sloop of war Hornet, captain Biddle, proceeded from the harbor of New-York into the Sound, with the intention of going to sea, but were chased by a British squadron into New-London, and blockaded there. June 1. The Chesapeake frigate was captured by the British frigate Shannon, after a sanguinary conflict, in which every officer on the upper deck of the Chesapeake was either killed or wounded. Lawrence, who had already immortalized himself in capturing the Peacock, had been appointed (very much against his wishes) to command the Chesapeake. While lying in the lower harbor of Boston, nearly ready for sea, the Shannon appeared off the harbor, and made signals expressive of a challenge. The brave Lawrence was not to be vainly defied, but immediately determined to proceed to sea and give battle to the haughty challenger, although he was conscious of the great disparity between the two ships. On seeing him come out, the Shannon bore away, and the Chesapeake followed. The action commenced within pistol shot, and the firing on both sides was tremendous—that of the Shannon peculiarly fatal; not only making great slaughter among the Chesapeake's men, but cutting down some of the most valuable officers, and wounding the commander. Three men were successively shot from the helm, each taking the wheel as the other fell, and this circumstance so affected the steering of the ship, that she fell foul of the Shannon, and became grappled by the fluke of her anchor. In this situation, while the Americans were swept from their stations by a terrible raking fire, the enemy succeeded in boarding. Lawrence had received a mortal wound, and was borne bleeding from the deck, exclaiming to his officers “dont give up the ship!” But the enemy had gained possession of the quarter-deck, and were soon masters of the frigate. Lawrence expired on the fifth day after the battle, and was buried in Halifax with the honors of war, as was, also, his first lieutenant, Augustus C. Ludlow, a young gentleman who had rendered himself admired for his bravery and beloved for his virtues. The American loss was forty killed and more than one hundred wounded. The British loss was perhaps not so great. June 20. The Creek Indians have commenced hostilities against the United States, by making war upon those Indians who are friendly to the American cause. June 25. The town of Hampton, in Virginia, about eighteen miles from Norfolk, was burnt and plundered by Cockburn's banditti, and the conflagration was followed by several instances of rape and murder, committed by the profligate soldiery! July 8. Two of the out-posts of the American encampment at Fort George, were this day attacked by the combined force of British and Indians. Adjutant lieutenant Eldridge, was ordered to proceed to the scene of action with a small detachment of thirty-nine men, and support his countrymen until a more formidable body could arrive, which was to follow him, under major Malcolm. In the ardor of contest, the gallant Eldridge was drawn into an ambuscade, and his brave little band, after a desperate fight, compelled to surrender, when they were all immediately massacred and scalped; their sculls were cloven in twain, their bosoms rent open, and their quivering hearts torn out, by these merciless savages. Eldridge shared the same fate, and only five of the party escaped. A more gallant soldier than lieutenant Eldridge, the army could not boast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLIX. A DUEL—TALKED OF. True courage, or true honor—'tis the same--- Proceeds from Heaven, and Virtue is its name. Where Duty calls, its blest possessor flies, Whatever perils in his path arise; Does death assail?---no tremor shakes his breast; Corporeal suffering?---still his soul's at rest; Unmerited reproach?---he'll kiss the rod; Contempt?---disgrace?---he'll not offend his God. Anon. Among several officers who had lately become attached to the American army in Canada, was captain Sandford. At the commencement of the war he was stationed on the Niagara frontier, and was at Black Rock when the gallant Elliott surprised and captured the Detroit and Caledonia, by which event young Willoughby was restored to liberty. Our hero's sudden departure for Lewiston, however, at that time, prevented an interview with Sandford, who soon after obtained a furlough to visit Boston and take possession of a considerable fortune to which he had become heir by the recent death of his mother. By various plausible excuses he had contrived to extend this furlough to above nine months, which he had passed in the most profligate extravagance and dissipation; till having expended all his ready cash, and drawn largely on the credit of his real estate, he began to dread the clamor of his creditors more than the thunder of the enemy's artillery, and therefore took a hasty leave of Boston, and proceeded to join the army. Willoughby and Sandford first recognised each other on parade, and the embarrassment of the latter was so visible that it did not escape the notice of several officers, who were, of course, ignorant of the cause. George informed him by a look that he knew him; Sandford had heard of his courage—he had felt his prowess—he knew that he had injured him, or at least attempted it. His reflections, during the day, were far from being enviable; and in the evening, when he received a letter from the hand of Reuben, who informed him that it was from lieutenant Willoughby, he had scarcely resolution to break the seal. What effect its contents produced on his mind will appear hereafter. He read as follows: “Friday Evening, July 16, 1813. “To Captain Thomas Sandford. “Sir—Pity alone has prompted me to take this method of relieving an embarrassment which must not only be very painful to your feelings, but which (judging from what I this day witnessed) will so impede the performance of your professional duties, as to endanger your reputation. But, sir, you may discard all apprehensions from your mind—I shall never molest you. You know the word of George Washington Willoughby is sacred—it was never yet violated—I shall not condescend to chastise a being whose meanness has sunk him so far below my resentment. I know what you might reasonably expect from many of our young officers, were they placed in my situation. But it is well known to you that my notions of honor are altogether different. You have never injured me, because—it was not in your power. But even if your despicable attempts had succeeded—had you robbed me of my greatest earthly treasure, your blood would no more tend to wash away the injury, than that which daily flows in the meanest butcher's shambles. Entertain no fears, then, for your life; I shall never seek to deprive you of a gem so tarnished with corruption, and yet, so dear to its possessor. “But, sir, though I harbor no resentment against you, and shall meet you on duty with perfect indifference, yet, do not seek my society; for our dispositions are so diametrically opposite, that no happiness can result from intercourse. No intimacy, therefore, must ever exist between us, until I have evident and incontrovertible proofs of a thorough reformation in your morals, and a radical change in your life and disposition. Then (but not till then) will I take you cordially by the hand, and ask no apology for the past. “G. W. WILLOUGHBY.” The first sensation which Sandford experienced on reading the foregoing letter, was pleasure for the dissipation of his personal fears; the next was rage at its cavilier and contemptuous style; the last was determined hatred and revenge. He well knew our hero's deep-rooted abhorrence of that species of cool-blooded murder called duelling —they had debated the subject largeIy at college, where George had often declared that he would never hesitate a moment in the choice— to be engaged in a duel, or to be posted for a coward. It was always his maxim, that in choosing between a sin and a shame, the latter was a lesser evil of the two. Sandford remembered all this, and was now convinced that George had not changed his opinion. He therefore resolved to establish his own reputation for courage, by challenging lieutenant Willoughby to single combat; and satisfy his revenge, by proclaiming him a coward. It may be recollected, that when Sandford entered the church at Cleveland, as recorded in the twenty-fifth chapter of this history,[19] [19] See volume i, page 206. he was accompanied by another officer with whom the reader was not then made acquainted. This man (whose name was Smith) was Sandford's most particular friend, had always been his companion in profligacy, his partner at the gaming table, and his associate in debauchery. In one respect, however, he was greatly Sandford's superior— he possessed courage, and had repeatedly distinguished himself in the field of battle. But, with the exception of Sandford, there was scarcely an officer in the army whom Smith could call his friend; he was considered a bully, and his society was rather avoided than courted. Our hero had a slight acquaintance with Smith, but had shown no disposition to increase it; he was, consequently, not a little surprised at receiving an early visit from that officer, on the morning following his communication to Sandford. Smith haughtily announced the nature of his embassy, and delivered a note from Sandford, demanding of lieutenant Willoughby immediate satisfaction for the unwarrantable insults contained in his letter of last evening. Our hero read the note with a smile, then coolly returned it to the bearer, with this verbal message—“Tell captain Sandford, that if he wishes to try the strength of his nerves, the enemy will probably soon afford him an opportunity. I have sufficient confidence in my own, already.” Smith. This is no answer, sir. George. This is my answer, sir. Smith. And you refuse to give captain Sandford the satisfaction due to a gentleman? George. I refuse to give captain Sandford an opportunity of making himself appear ridiculous, which I know would be the case did I accede to his mad proposal. He would sooner beg my pardon, sir, on parade, than meet me as an enemy. Such a humiliation he richly merits, but I will not violate my duty even to inflict that. Smith. Where your ungenerous insinuations against the honor of my friend, founded on fact, sir, would he have thus invited a meeting? Let me request you, sir, to be consistent. This note was written by captain Sandford. George. And captain Sandford, sir, would sooner have eaten his fingers than written that note to me, did he not hold my written pledge that I would take no step hostile to his personal safety. It is upon that pledge alone that he thus presumes. Smith. I am not authorised, sir, to receive any explanations, nor do I ask any. I wish to return my friend a definitive answer. Will you, or will you not, meet captain Sandford? 38 George. Never, as an enemy—never as a friend, until he reforms his morals. Smith. Then, sir, I am authorised to inform you that my friend Sandford will find himself reduced to the necessity, not only of proclaiming you to the army and the world for a cowardly paltroon, but of treating you as such whenever he meets you. George. Your friend Sandford, sir, loves himself too well to put his threat in execution; and I hope his friends will not so jeopardize their reputation as to become his agents. Smith. What, sir, if I do? George. You will proclaim yourself a liar, and forfeit the confidence of all honest men. Smith. This language is very singular, sir, and such as I did not expect from an officer of your standing and reputation. You cannot, surely, be ignorant of the customary course to be pursued in such cases? Captain Sandford feels himself injured by you, and demands redress—an honorable reparation. What can be more reasonable than such a demand on his part, or more just than a compliance on yours? George. I never injured any man. If any man thinks, or like your friend Sandford, affects to think that I have wronged him, let him invite a meeting of accommodation in presence of a certain number of gentlemen whom he himself may choose, and whatever be their decision, on hearing both sides of the question, I will willingly abide by. Ask your friend to submit his cause to such a test, and he will blush—if he be yet susceptible of shame. He dare not thus expose the meanness and duplicity of his past conduct—he dare not exhibit the letter on which his present insolence is predicated—he would almost as soon fight. Tell him, however, that I retain a copy of it. Smith. Although I act as the friend of captain Sandford in this affair, I know nothing of the merits of the case. He seeks the meeting, and has commissioned me to see that it be conducted on fair and honorable principles. It is not my business to inquire whether his injuries are real or imaginary. The pledge you mention— George. (Rising with dignity) Does not extend to his friends, sir; and I wish no further communion with a man who can so far forget the dignity of his nature as to espouse a cause in any controversy, while he confesses he is ignorant of its merits. You have heard my answer to your principal—my time is too valuable to be thus dissipated. Good morning, sir. Smith. You will hear again from me, sir. George. It will give me no pleasure, sir, unless I hear that you have adopted sentiments more congenial with virtue and genuine honor. Once more, good morning. Sandford had been awaiting his friend's return in the most anxious suspense. More than once he wished to recal the note of defiance he had written, lest it should be accepted, and he be compelled to fight, or become an object of contempt and ridicule. The solemn promise of Willoughby, however, added to his established and undisguished principles, had set his mind at rest on that score, and he was contemplating the triumph which awaited him, when Smith entered his quarters, and related verbatim his conversation with Willoughby. Sandford did blush, and bite his lips, too, till they bled, during the recital. He began to feel that he did indeed “love himself too well” to proclaim lieutenant Willoughby a coward to an army that almost adored him for his generous gallantry—to officers who (of every grade) were ambitious of his society and conversation, and zealous in emulating his courage, manners, and fascinating accomplishments. Sandford was well aware that Willoughby had numerous friends in the camp who were brave as himself, and not bound by those correct principles of reason and religion, by which George was governed; he therefore reasonably concluded, that to announce himself as the enemy of lieutenant Willoughby, would be to expose himself to the indignation of too many rash spirits. He finally determined to let the matter drop, content with having proved his spirit, in the eyes of Smith at least, whom he requested to pursue the affair no further, nor expose either of them to an arrest for having violated an order of the war department, forbidding the sending or bearing a challenge. But with respect to Smith's opinion of his courage, Sandford was mistaken. The hints of Willoughby, and the present conduct of Sandford, created suspicions in the mind of Smith not very honorable to his friend; he therefore replied with this observation: “Then I am to understand, sir, that you are satisfied?” Sandford. Yes—no, sir—not satisfied; but if the scoundrel refuses to meet me, what step can be taken? Smith. Cane him, kick him, pull his nose. Sandford. Why, to be sure—but would not that be descending to the level of a blackguard? I think, sir, we had better let it drop, at least for the present. I shall find some opportunity of taking satisfaction. Smith. Now, sir, show me the letter mentioned by Willoughby and alluded to in this note. I wish to see the nature of an insult that you can so easily pocket. Sandford. That letter—O, that letter, sir, is mislaid; but it is not worth your inspection: it is a low piece of studied insolence, amounting in its nature to a challenge, and as such he no doubt intended it; but finding me ready to meet him, he consults his own safety, and declines. Smith. Beware, captain Sandford, how you trifle with me! If my suspicions be well founded, and you have presumed to make me an actor in a farce—eternal woes rest upon you! Better had you been dashed down the falls of Niagara than thus incur my resentment! At this moment, before Sandford could sufficiently recover from his astonishment to reply, a sudden alarm was spread through the encampment, the bugles rang, and the drums beat to arms. An outpost of the army was attacked, by a large body of British and Indians, and Scott was ordered out with a detachment to oppose them. “I shall volunteer;” cried Smith—“If you have courage, Sandford, do the same.” So saying he rushed out, and the detachment with many volunteers, were soon on the march. The enemy were numerous, and the conflict obstinate. Willoughby and Smith fought side by side, and their conduct was particularly applauded by the gallant Scott. In less than an hour the assailants were dispersed with considerable loss, while that of the Americans was comparatively trifling. This affair, though small, served to test the merits of 38* the officers engaged, and more ardor was never displayed on a similar occasion. Vandeusen, Madison, Cummins, Birdsall, and Towson, all distinguished themselves in the performance of their several duties. The brave Towson was wounded in the hand, while voluntarily bearing Scott's orders to officers of detachments. As the victors were returning to camp, Smith seized our hero by the hand, and with an oath threatened to make that man eat his words who should hereafter in his hearing express a doubt of Willoughby's courage. George begged him, with a goodnatured smile, to give himself no trouble on his account, assuring him that he was ever ready to forgive any man for merely expressing an erroneous opinion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER L. WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED. Oh! she has deck'd his ruin with her love, And made perdition pleasing. Dryd. All for Love. It was a delightful evening: the noxious impurities of a sultry atmosphere had just been dissipated by the “red artillery of heaven,” whose receding murmurs were still heard at a distance, in the east; the sun had sunk in golden splendor behind the Canadian mountains, while the “bow of promise” seemed to span the far-extended territory of freemen. The air was balmy, cool, and refreshing; the moon-beam played on the ever-restless bosom of Niagara, and sparkled in the rain-drops with which every leaf was freighted. Both George and Reuben had (as usual, in a summer evening) disencumbered their persons of every martial habiliment, and were loosely attired in light mantles of India calico. Our hero had just finished a very tender epistle to his Catharine, and arose to enjoy the beauties of the evening scene, when he observed that Reuben was also busily employed with his pen. This was not a circumstance so unusual as to excite any surprise or curiosity in the mind of George, had not his attendant, on this occasion, exhibited evident tokens of embarrassment on being discovered, and attempted to conceal the paper. “No treason, Reuben, I hope?” asked George, with one of his irresistible smiles of inquiry; “no intercourse with the enemy?” “O, no, sir.” “With a sweetheart, perhaps? Well—I shall not chide you.” The modest lad blushed deeply; and, after a moment's hesitation, replied— “I only write for amusement, sir.” “What amuses Reuben in writing,” replied George “might entertain his friend in reading— if you think him deserving such confidence.” “O sir, I have no single thought that I wish to conceal from you. This is nothing secret; but I am apprehensive that so accomplished a scholar and poet as yourself, will be too severe a critic on the simple effusions of my brain.” “Is it poetry, then? I shall esteem the privilege of its perusal a fresh token of your friendship. Come, Reuben, be under no apprehensions of severity from me. When has my severity ever given you pain?” “Never, sir,” replied Reuben, “and therefore I tremble to encounter it. It would break my heart.” “You shall never encounter it—faithful, affectionate boy!” exclaimed George. “I love you as a brother, and in me you shall always meet a brother's tenderness and affection.” “And will you permit me to call you brother?” eagerly enquired Reuben. “Let the appellation be reciprocal. And now, my little brother, on what subject have you been exercising your poetic talent?” “You must not laugh at me,” stammered Reuben; “but—you have often commended a lively little song, beginning— “While in camp my soldier lives—” and have been pleased to praise my voice, and style of singing it. This has induced me to make an attempt to adapt new words to the same air; and, if you will excuse my vanity, I will submit them to your inspection.” “Your vanity, Reuben, will never be obtrusive, while connected with your present modesty. But now I must beg the favor of your singing this production—and then, I am certain I shall be pleased with it.” After a little hesitation, Reuben complied, and sung the following words, in a faultless and fascinating style. If there was any imperfection in the execution, it was attributable to the extreme youth of the performer, which rendered his voice rather too effeminate, though peculiarly sweet. LOVE IN CAMP. Sounds of war were swelling wild, Fearful notes the bugle blew; Infant Love, a timid child, Trembled at the rat-tat-too. But inspired by Valor's breath, Love with war familiar grew, Fearless view'd the strife of death, Smiled to hear the rat-tat-too. Swift a shaft at Valor's heart, From the infant's bow-string flew; Valor heeded not the dart, List'ning to the rat-tat-too. Yet that dart was tipp'd with red, Ella's heart-blood lent the hue: But in vain had Ella bled, Valor loved the rat-tat-too. Through the camp the infant stray'd, Hope receding now from view; Secret griefs his sighs betray'd, Mingling with the rat-tat-too. Valor will not yield to Love, Hope to Ella bids adieu; Sad, desponding, widow'd dove, Listless to the rat-tat-too. “The performance far exceeds my expectation,” said George, as Reuben concluded; “but I confess I do not understand the plot. Who is this Ella?” “The story is old,” answered Reuben. “Ella loved a young hero whose mistress was Glory; and so eager was he in the pursuit of military fame, that he was totally insensible to the charms of beauty. She followed him to camp, disguised in male attire, enjoyed his society, but never had the courage to discover herself; till, languishing and drooping with a hopeless passion, in the hour of death she disclosed, at once, the secret of her sex, and the consuming flame that preyed upon her existence. Oh! my brother, would you not have pitied the unfortunate Ella?” “Who could withhold his pity? But you tell this story with the pathes of a lover. Is it possible that my brother Reuben has felt this “consuming flame?” Can the infant deity have pierced a bosom so young as this? As our hero spoke, he placed his hand on the shrinking Reuben's palpitating heart, and started with amazement. With eager haste he tore open the ruffled cambric that veiled a female bosom, and exclaimed— “Rash—imprudent girl! Who are you?” The counterfeit Reuben fell prostrate at the feet of our hero; then clinging to his knees, and raising a pair of streaming eyes, implored his forgiveness. “Oh! do not hate me, my brother!” uttered a feminine voice almost stifled with convulsive sobs. “You have allowed me the privilege of calling you brother—Oh! do not retract it—it is all the bliss I aspire to. Do not abandon—do not despise—do not murder with reproaches, one whose only fault is loving you! To live in your presence—to hear your voice—to meet your smiles—this is all I ask—all I hope—Oh! do not deny me that! Pity, at least, the lost Sophia!” “Lost, indeed!” exclaimed the thunderstruck George. “Dreadful—fatal infatuation!” “O think what must have been the extent of my love! For that have I abandoned a husband who adored me!—parents, whose existence was bound up in mine!—broke a sister's heart!— forfeited the respect and esteem of the virtuous!— encountered the hardships of a camp!—risked the dangers of war! and, what I value most of all, risked your displeasure!—all for love!—for the sake of being near to you—to hear you speak— to see you smile—to nurse you in sickness—to serve you in health! And will you hate me for this, my brother? Oh! rather stab me to the heart at once, and take that life which is devoted to you—a life which knows no joy but what it derives from your friendship! Rather let your sword pierce this bosom, and end my miseries by death.” As Sophia uttered these last words, she rose upon her knees, and throwing open her loose attire, displayed a bosom heaving with agitation and doubtful hopes—white as alabaster—beautiful beyond description. Her black eyes, suffused with tears, were fixed with a melting fondness on those of George, and through them she poured her very soul, emanating in the dazzling rays of love. George was bewildered—she saw her advantage—and, suddenly rising, threw herself into his arms. “Through her parting robe, the alternate breast “With youth wild-throbbing, on his dazzled gaze “In full luxuriance rose.—He drew “Such madd'ning draughts of beauty to the soul, “As for a while o'erwhelm'd his raptured thought “With luxury too daring.” Our hero had frequently stood firm and unmoved when assailed by a host of British invincibles— conquerors in Egypt, Spain, and France; he had heard unappalled the savage war-whoop, and encountered all the terrors of an Indian fight, without suffering a nerve to quiver—a joint to tremble. But now, his nerves quivered—his joints trembled—his bosom palpitated. He was closely, warmly pressed in the arms of an amorous, melting beauty, whose soul was dissolved in love: “Loose, unattired, warm, tender, full of wishes.” I have never asserted that my hero was more than a man. Sophia conquered. Let fastidious virtue close the volume. I write nothing but truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LI. REMORSE AND REPENTANCE. Consideration, like an angel, came, And whipt the offending Adam out of him; Leaving his body as a Paradise; To envelope and contain celestial spirits. Shakspeare. At the conclusion of the thirty-ninth chapter of this history,[20] [20] See page 60, of this volume. I asserted that our hero (on the occasion there mentioned) was “unhappy without being guilty;” which assertion was followed by this exclamation—“How much MORE unhappy would George have been, had he been guilty!” This reflection alone, at that time, had a tendency to remove his uneasiness, and restore his composure. But now, alas! George had no such balm for his wounded mind. He was now guilty—unhappy—miserable; nor could all the fascinations of the frail Sophia—her boundless love, or her lavished caresses, banish the gnawing worm of remorse from his bosom. Every returning morning witnessed his contrition, and the formation of good resolutions, which every returning evening dissolved into air. Trembling lest habit should at length entirely strip Vice of that haggard deformity which had always kept him aloof from her haunts, (but which was now daily becoming less odious to his view) he “resolved and re-resolved” to cast off the rosy yoke which debased him, and no longer endure the goading thorns it concealed. But again the Syren charmed—again the victim fell; resistance grew weaker at every trial, and the “foul fiend” whispered—“O, who would stand, when 'tis so sweet to fall!” “Once more”—sighed the bewildered George, “only once more will I taste the intoxicating cup, and then dash it forever from my lips!” Rash, imprudent, infatuated youth! His Satanic majesty has not a more crafty minister in his whole court, than this dangerous, insinuating “Once More.” While you admit him at your counsel-board, true Repentance (the only guide to reformation) is kept aloof, and cannot enter. As George was sitting one evening, in his quarters, suffering rather than enjoying the caresses of his amorous inamorato, who hung upon his neck with growing fondness, tenderly complaining of his coldness, and pressing her glowing lips to his “as if she'd pluck up kisses by the roots”—his eye accidentally (as 'tis called) rested on a letter, directed to his father, which had for more than a week remained neglected in his card-rack. It was the envelope of that which he had addressed to Catharine on the fatal evening 39 which witnessed his first aberration from the path of innocence. A letter for Catharine had always heretofore been hurried to the post-office, after receiving a kiss on the seal, which was there to remain in torpidity until resuscitated by the warmth of her own lips. But now a most tender epistle had been written, enclosed in the usual envelope, and then—forgotten! A train of reflections now rushed across the mind of our hero, which so powerfully affected him, that he started on his feet, clasped his hands in convulsive agony, and involuntarily exclaimed, with a vehemence that terrified the guilty fair one from whose circling arms he had torn himself— “Oh! Catharine!—Catharine! How have I damn'd myself!” With this exclamation, he rushed out, leaving Sophia drowned in tears. The night was extremely dark, except when the lightning broke at intervals through a black heavy cloud in the southern horizon; the rain descended in torrents, and George was without his hat and coat, with a thin mantle streaming behind him in the breeze, as he flitted along like the genius of the tempest, heedless of the path he took, and insensible to his situation. The sudden challenge of a sentinel awoke him from his reverie, and was repeated before he could recollect the countersign. The name of the immortal Pike secured him a pass, and in a few minutes he found himself on the river bank. Here he threw himself on the wet ground, and gave free and audible vent to his self-reproaches. “Oh! that I could recal the last accursed week!” he exclaimed with bitterness—“and regain my lost peace! The foul—the monstrous crime of adultery! O, my God! why was I reserved for this! Why called to a trial so far beyond my feeble strength!” Then starting upon his feet, and looking wildly about him, he continued— “Is this George Washington Willoughby!— this the son of Edward Willoughby!—the brother of that “image of love, purity, and truth, that moves in the person of Amelia?”[21] [21] See Morse's letter to George, chapter xliv, page 99, of this vol. Is this the “angelic being” for whose safety the innocent Catharine trembles† † See chapter xxxv, page 14, of this volume. —these the limbs which she fears may be mangled in battle? Would to Heaven they had been—hewn to pieces, before they encircled a wanton adultress! Better had this form been trampled to atoms in the field of honor, than to lie panting with guilty rapture on the bosom of lasciviousness! But here, on my knees, I swear”— “Swear not!” uttered a low and solemn voice almost in his ear. “Add not the crime of perjury to that of adultery.” George started from the posture he was assuming, and beheld by his side a tall dark figure. At that moment a bright flash of lightning dissipated for a moment the gloom, and he recognised the Mysterious Chief. Silent and abashed, George stood like a guilty culprit awaiting a heavy sentence; he dared not raise his eyes, but kept them fixed on the warrior's feet. “Swear not—but repent;” uttered the chief, after a moment's pause. “Wish not to recal the past, seek rather to prevent the future. What is once done, can never be undone. The stain is fixed, and oceans of tears can never efface it. You never can be the same Willoughby that you have been. But though the stain of your crime is indelible, as yet it rests upon the surface, and has not contaminated the interior. You can never wash it from the skin, but you can prevent its pervading the vitals; and unless you do prevent it —wo be unto your soul!” “How can I prevent it?”—enquired George, timidly raising his eyes. “By repentance.” “Have you not just witnessed the bitterness of my repentance?—the poignancy of that remorse which makes me hate and detest myself?” “It is not repentance.” “Not repentance!” “Remorse is sometimes an inducement to the work of repentance, but it is not repentance itself. Genuine repentance is not a mere sorrow or regret for having committed certain offences; but it is the abstaining from committing such offences. The Almighty has summed it up in these four words—“Cease to do evil.” Ceasing to commit a sin, is the only way to overcome the propensity to its commission; and without overcoming it, it will overcome you, and become the ruling love of your soul. No soul can be happy whose ruling love is evil.” “I hate my crime!” exclaimed George, “detest and abominate it. I hate myself for being guilty of it.” “I know you do,” replied the chief, “and therefore I said the stain was yet on the surface. But, beware of repetition! Every addition to the stain sinks deeper and deeper, and its progress to the pure temple of divinity within, increases in geometrical progression. If evil enters there, the Lord of the temple must depart, and it will soon become a den of thieves. Your hate and detestation of adultery was less yesterday, than it was eight days before; repeat the crime, and it will be still less to-morrow; in a short time, what now tears your bosom with remorse, would scarcely agitate it with a sigh—instead of hating, you would soon contemplate the crime with complacency, and afterwards love it. Then would the fatal stain have reached the soul, and marked it for an associate of devils.” “I would have sworn—I will now most solemnly affirm never to—” “Make no resolutions,” interrupted the chief, “if you found them on the basis of self-sufficiency. Place not too much confidence in your strength independent of divine assistance. You ask why you was called to a trial beyond your strength? Every trial is beyond the strength of a man who trusts to his own powers alone—no trial is beyond his strength if he is always careful gratefully to bear in mind the source from whence that strength proceeds. You had forgotten this important truth, though it has been so often inculcated by your virtuous father, and you was permitted to fall, in order to have it more deeply impressed on your mind—to become fully convinced of your own weakness, when not upheld by the hand of mercy. You had become self-confident, grown vain of the good propensities which had been lent you, forgotten from whom you derived them, and said “they are my own.” You renounced the society of others, until they reform their morals! Now let my pupil reform his own—or he will hear the voice of his Mentor no more.” 39* “Your pupil will reform;” replied George with energy. “You know my heart—is it not sincere?” “Learn to know it yourself. You are at this moment entertaining a resolution to abstain from sin. Beware how you rob Heaven by calling that resolution your own. It is a spiritual dictate, and will only become yours so far as you obey it. Think it your own, and it vanishes. Ask for it in sincerity, and it will come again.” “With Heaven's assistance, I will be all you wish,” uttered George, with tears of gratitude in his eyes; “and for such assistance will I daily apply; I will also pour out my soul in gratitude for the peculiar privilege I enjoy in your friendly counsel; he who would not become good with such a monitor, must be lost indeed!” “If your privilege in this respect is peculiar, it is the fault of man that it is so. Every human being might enjoy a superior privilege, if each one would move in the orbit for which he was designed. You was rapidly descending from yours, and would soon have lost me.” “Kind being! to catch me in the fall.” “That was not in my power. Divine mercy arrested your fall, and held your suspended by the thread of reflection. Then it was my province to step in, and admonish you to reclimb the slender web by which you hung, and regain your lost footing in the skies.” “Accept my gratitude.” “It is due to Heaven alone. Never again forget this short precept—“Do your duty, and leave the result to Heaven.” “I will ever endeavor to bear it in mind, and regulate my future conduct by it.” “To-morrow will call for an exercise of the precept. The bearer of important news is at hand—receive it as you ought, and be a man. Do your duty—and place your trust in Providence.” So saying, the Mysterious Chief walked deliberately away towards the American camp, and was soon lost to our hero's view. The rain had now ceased, and the moon broken forth; and although our hero was wet to the skin, he continued to stroll along on the river bank, until the Newark clock told the hour of two; he then directed his course towards the camp, and proceeded to his quarters. Sophia was still watching, almost distracted with grief for his absence, and fears for his safety. “O George!” cried she, clinging to his bosom—“you do not love me!” “I have never deceived you, Sophia, with any assurances that I did love you.” “But does not love like mine deserve some return? Is it kind, George, is it grateful to chill it with such coldness? Let the happy Catharine be your wife, but O, do not spurn poor Sophia entirely from you. No wife can love with affection like that I feel for you. Think you that Catharine would sacrifice for you what I have sacrificed?” “If she did, I should pity her as I now pity you. Sophia! you have been successful in rendering me the most miserable of beings, and the cause of this effect you call love! Dreadful profanation of that sacred word! You have made me wretched! and the only way that I can recover the peace which you have banished from my soul, is to banish you from my arms. I will not become the slave of a vice that I detest.” “Kill me, my love!” cried Sophia, throwing herself on her knees before him, and clasping his in her arms, “kill me here at your feet—but, Oh! do not banish me from your bosom! Call not the mutual bliss we have tasted by so harsh a name. Can that (continued she rising and throwing her arms around his neck) be vicious which makes us happy? If you would but consent to be as happy in my arms as I am in yours—if you would discard these cold prejudices which have made the world wretched, and give up your whole soul to love as I do, you would, like me, know no other care but the sweet pain of a short separation, which only increases the coming rapture of the next meeting; you would permit no fears of the future to mar the present bliss, nor thus fly from my fond embrace, to wander about in solitude, darkness, and rain, until you become drenched and chilled, as your whole frame now is. Come, my love, discard that frown, and let me thaw that frozen cheek in my warm bosom, where the flame of love forever burns.” “Sophia!—there's fascination, madness, death in your embrace! I must not—cannot—will not again be the victim of its witchcraft! Unhappy girl! you are cheating yourself with a delusive phantom, which will soon vanish like a morning dream, and leave you awake to the keenest despair—a guilty, wretched creature—with no present peace—no future hopes! Are you so infatuated as to risk eternal pain for momentary pleasure? If you are—I will not—so help me Heaven! be any more a sharer in the guilt. Let me conjure you to return to—” “To whom shall I return?” interrupted the wretched girl. “Oh! George! I have no home— no friends! A husband's vengeance would pursue me—a parent's curse overwhelm me. Every door is shut against me. To whom then can I return? O, George! to no one; with you I must remain, until you kill me with unkindness, or compel me to kill myself, by abandoning me to despair.” “You came to me unsolicited, Sophia; imposed yourself on me for a boy, and in that character stole my affections; and then, in one fatal, unguarded moment, robbed me of innocence, and destroyed my happiness. But the robbery shall be no further extended. Whatever pangs my pity for your wretchedness may inflict. I deserve them all, and will endure them. However severe the trial, we must part! If you tax me with cruelty, I cannot help it; I will do my duty, and look to Heaven for the result. Let me conjure you, then, Sophia, to repent of the past, and live in future so as to regain the lost respect of mankind, the esteem of your friends, and the approbation of Heaven. The extent of your transgression is a secret to all but myself. The crime of deserting a jealous husband may be overlooked by the world—your virtue may never be suspected, and thus many obstacles are removed from the path of reformation. Return a penitent to your father, and I know that he will forgive you. I know the path of repentance winds up a steep and thorny hill; but by perseverance you may yet reach the summit, and again find peace and happiness. This I advise—I conjure you to do; no pecuniary obstacle shall interrupt or deter you, for my father's liberality will enable me to supply you with every comfort.” Sophia remained sunk on a chair in a speechless, tearless agony, during the latter part of this address. She could not weep, and her blood-shot eyes stared with a terrific wildness on the speaker. When he ceased, she attempted to reply, but labored some time as if choked for utterance. Both her hands were prest on her heart, and her bosom heaved in tumultuous agitation. At length she spoke— “No, no, it will not break! Its juices are turned to gall. You have tugged at the vital cords, till harmony is changed to discord, bliss to wo, love to hate. Were my slighted kisses poison, could my lips but emit the scorpion's venom, I would once more, in spite of your resistance, press them to yours, till yours became cold in death. You have driven an angel from my bosom, and a devil has usurped its seat.” “Sophia! are you mad!” “Yes!—raving. My brain's on fire! You have trampled on my heart, and converted the nectar of love to wormwood. I hate you more than ever I loved you—I risked the loss of Heaven for my love—I would willingly incur certain damnation, to make you feel my hate. Willingly would I plunge into the burning centre of hell, could I drag you thither with me. Hark! the reveillee beats! I know my instrument—and shall have my revenge.” Before the astonished George could reply, she rushed past him, and disappeared; while he proceeded to dress for the review, with more composure than he had for some time experienced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LII. THE FORTUNE OF WAR. —“Know that true valor soars above What this world calls misfortune and affliction; These are not real, but apparent ills, That give the mind occasion to exert Its hidden strength, and throw out into practice Virtues which shun the day, and lie concealed In the smooth seasons and the calms of life.” Addison's Calo. When George reached his quarters, after the parade was over, he was surprised to find an Indian awaiting his return; and his surprise was not lessened when, in the graceful warrior, he recognised the youthful Logan. Without making any answer to the eager inquiries of our hero, Logan hastily delivered him a letter, saying— “That paper will speak every thing—look— look!” George knew his father's hand, and tearing it open, read as follows: “Cleveland, Ohio, July 20th, 1813. “Call all your native fortitude to your aid, my son, for the intelligence I have to communicate is afflicting. Catharine Fleming is safe under my protection—would I could say she was well. Her amiable mother has joined the rest of her unfortunate family in a better world. Fleming is a prisoner of war, and their house is in ashes. Mulberry Grove exhibits nothing but a black heap of smoking ruins. “First recover that— and then thou shalt hear further.” Before George reached the last sentence, the characters swam before his eyes—his limbs tottered, and he was obliged to cling to the door for support. Logan helped him to a seat, and after a powerful struggle with his feelings, he regained sufficient composure to proceed. “In my last I informed you that the depredations of the savages were extended along the shores of this lake, and that many of the inhabitants had been killed or made prisoners. But a severe check which they afterwards received from the gallant colonel Ball, had lulled our fears to rest, in this vicinity. “On Sunday morning, the eighteenth instant, young Logan arrived at the Grove, and informed me that he had been solicited to join a party of Seneca and Tuscorora Indians, whom Boyd had consented to receive into the American service, and that he was then on his way to Fort George for that purpose. On learning that you was at that encampment, he consented to stop until I could prepare a letter and a small remittance for you, which I knew could be safely confided to so trusty a messenger. When night came, Logan, as usual, spread his blanket in the porch, and slept with his rifle in his hand. “About midnight I was awakened by the report of fire-arms, and springing from my bed, found my chamber illumined by a bright light that shone through my window, and before I could slip on my clothes, Logan flew into the room and informed me that a party of Indians had fired the stable, and were now approaching the house. The alarm had now spread through the house, and the shrieks of the housekeeper and her two daughters, added not a little to the general consternation. “While my laborers were hurrying on their clothes and seizing their rifles, which we always kept loaded, I took a position to reconnoitre the enemy, and by the light of the conflagrated outhouses, (which by this time were all participating in the fate of the stable) I ascertained their force to be not more than twenty, and that a retreat was open for the women through the garden. They wanted no urging to fly, and I directed them to conceal themselves in the woods until the danger was over. They had scarcely left the house, when a volley of rifle slugs was poured against it, which did no other damage, however, than shatter the windows, and perforate the wall. “Our force was but twelve men, including myself. Five of them followed Logan through the garden to attack their rear, while the rest of us made a sortie on their front. We met them on the platform, as they were loading their pieces, and came upon them so suddenly that it threw them into disorder, they having no idea that my house was a garrison. Every rifle dropped its man, in front and rear. The survivors returned our fire, and then retreated with their customary yell. We followed up the advantage we had gained, and a second discharge so diminished their numbers, that we imagined the contest was terminated; when, turning my eyes towards Fleming's, I saw his habitation in flames, and a band of about thirty savages rapidly approaching the Grove. “Three of our little band were badly wounded, but no one was dismayed. I hastily posted them behind the stone wall which separates the little orchard from the road, with orders to reserve their fire until the advancing savages (with whom the fugitives had now formed a junction) were passing the muzzles of our pieces. One of our 40 party, however, imprudently, fired too soon, and totally defeated the object of my arrangement. The savages paused a moment, and then assailed our little breast-work with such fury that it was soon carried, while our fire was wasted at random. Our party was surrounded, and nearly cut to pieces; Logan fought like a blood-hound, beating down the foe with the but end of his rifle, until the stock was shivered in his hands; he then seized a hatchet from a fallen chief, and literally cut a path through the enemy, by which three of us effected our retreat; the remainder were either slain, or made prisoners. Logan, myself, and a young Irishman whom I had lately employed, were all that escaped the contest, and we precipitately fled across the meadow towards Cleveland, leaving the enemy masters of the field. When we reached the road, we ventured to pause, and looking back, saw the flames just bursting through the roof of our habitation. A horrid yell of the savages announced their hellish joy at the sight, and we could now see them preparing to decamp, several of the painted devils being mounted on my horses. “The sound of an approaching bugle now saluted our ears, and in a few minutes a small corps of mounted riflemen met us on the road from Cleveland. The alarm had extended to that village, and these brave fellows had immediately assembled to pursue the barbarous enemy. I gave their leader every necessary direction, and the little company again set forward on a gallop. “The day was now dawning, and I determined to seek some intelligence respecting the family of Fleming. With the most fearful presentiments I approached that once happy seat of virtue and hospitality. The ruins of the dwelling-house were still blazing, but the barn had not been fired. As we approached that building, Logan directed my attention to a track of blood on the ground, and my own curdled with horror. I rushed forward determined to know the worst. “The barn door was open, and we entered, when a sight met our view, calculated to melt the stoutest heart with pity, and nerve the weakest with courage. On the cold bare floor sat Catharine, supporting on her knees the head of her mother, and endeavoring to stanch with her linen the blood that issued from a wound in that mother's breast. Unfortunately Logan first met the eye of Catharine, who uttered a piercing shriek, and sunk lifeless on the bleeding bosom of her mother. Mrs. Fleming raised her languid eyes to me, and attempted to speak. “Fly for assistance!” I exclaimed to Logan, who disappeared at the word. Assisted by Patrick, I succeeded in removing the females to a crib of straw, spread over them our outside garments, (for both of them were in their night-frocks) and screened them from the morning air as well as circumstances would permit. Catharine soon recovered from her swoon, but wept so excessively that I trembled for her heart. I now examined the wound in her mother's bosom, and shuddered on discovering that it was made with a rifle ball! She observed my consternation, and faintly uttered, as she pressed my hand— “I know it—I know it. I am sensible that my hour is almost come, and I am resigned to my fate. But, O, protect and comfort poor Catharine—me you cannot help. O, my poor husband! what may be his fate! Should Catharine be indeed an orphan, you will not desert her?” “A short captivity,” I replied, “is, I trust, the worst fate that my friend is doomed to suffer from the enemy. In any event, however, I solemnly promise to be a friend and father to Catharine.” “Logan now entered, with several persons of both sexes, whom he had met flying towards the scene of devastation, to furnish every assistance in their power. A litter was procured for Mrs. Fleming, on which she was gently placed, and borne by four men to Cleveland. Fleming's family waggon followed, with the almost distracted Catharine, supported between two of her female friends, assisted by myself. On our arrival, a surgeon was procured, who immediately pronounced the wound of Mrs. Fleming to be mortal; and, in an hour afterwards, she expired. “The mounted riflemen who pursued the Indians, succeeded in driving them into the woods, killed two, and made one prisoner. I directed Logan to examine this Indian, and from his report I am convinced that Fleming has fallen into their hands alive and unhurt. Four of my little band were left lifeless in the orchard along with seven of the savages, who were all buried last evening in the spot where they fell. Most of the prisoners are severely wounded. Those who fell on the platform, are buried in the smoking ruins of the house. “Of the horrid transactions at Fleming's, I can give you no account, until Catharine becomes sufficiently composed to relate what passed under her observation. The body of Susan (who was married, soon after you left us, last summer, to a very worthy laborer on Fleming's plantation) was found at some distance from the barn, mangled in a manner too horrid for description—an unborn infant, which had been torn from her womb, lay near her feet, cloven nearly in two by a tomahawk! The unhappy husband is probably a prisoner with Fleming. The females of my family, who remained concealed in the woods until after sunrise, have arrived in safety at Cleveland. “The bodies of Mrs. Fleming and Susan, will be buried to-morrow, and will be followed by a larger procession of real mourners, than this place has ever exhibited on any former occasion. “Catharine is, at present, inconsolable; but “God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.” I have communicated the melancholy event to her uncle, William O'Hara, who has joined Perry's squadron at Erie, and holds some respectable office on board the commodore's brig. To-morrow I shall write to my friend Harrison, requesting him to exert his influence to procure the release of the prisoners on parole; or, at least, that of Fleming, whose presence would tend, more than any thing else, to restore the tranquility of Catharine's mind. “Logan will make no delay in flying to his preserver with this letter. If he can serve you in any thing, make him happy by employing him. A remittance, you must not expect; but if you are absolutely in want, draw on your uncle in Boston, and the draught will be duly honored. My loss is severe, as not a single article was saved at Mulberry Grove; but this is a loss which can soon be repaired. My crops bid fair to be excellent, and as I have now no barns, I shall sell them on the field. 40* “I shall write again soon, when you may expect further particulars. In the mean time, forget not to place a due reliance on Providence, who orders all things for the best; and still believe me to be, as ever, your affectionate father, “E. WILLOUGHBY.” For several minutes after reading this letter, George paced the floor in silence; then, pausing suddenly, he raised his clasped hands in agony towards Heaven, and while the big tear trembled in either eye, with faltering voice he fervently ejaculated— “Save her! Almighty God! O, pity me, and save her!” Then suddenly dropping his hands, and fixing his eyes on the ground, he added in a mournful tone—“that is an impious prayer. A wretch like me to ask so great a blessing!—a devil pleading for an angel!—and not pleading for her happiness, but for my own! O, take her, righteous Heaven! if it be thy will, take her to thyself! Let her be happy, and I will kiss the rod. It was through her pure bosom alone, that the blow could reach my heart, and thus the innocent suffer with the guilty. And shall I wish her unmerited sufferings to be prolonged? O no, the will of Heaven be done. And yet, to lose her— to forfeit the bliss anticipated for years!—But I deserve it all---I am not worthy of such excellence. At that dreadful hour, while she, surrounded with horrors, was supporting a bleeding, dying mother, I was in the arms of guilt! 'Tis just—'tis just! I will not complain. The storm is subsided—the will of Heaven be done—I am resigned.” This resignation was, in a few days, rewarded by the following letter from his father: “Cleveland, Ohio, July 25, 1813. “I am happy, my dear boy, to inform you, that by a courier, who is travelling express from Harrison's head-quarters to Erie, I have received a letter from Fleming, written on board an English gun-boat in Sandusky Bay, just preparing to sail for Malden. He is anxious to learn the fate of his family, and fears the worst. Catharine herself has undertaken to relieve this suspense, by writing immediately, and as flags are frequently passing between the two armies, there will be no difficulty attending its conveyance, except the customary inspection of its contents, which is of no consequence. I am sensible of Harrison's disposition to oblige me, and he has promised to exert his influence in procuring Fleming's release. May the choicest blessings of Heaven rest upon the hero's head. “The certainty of yet possessing a father, although in captivity, has produced a happy effect on the mind of Catharine, whose grief has now subsided into a pensive calm. Her meek and humble reliance on the love and wisdom of her Heavenly Parent, has diffused a gentle quiet through her soul, which has already exhibited its beneficial influence on her bodily health. Such, my son, are the delightful effects of a genuine christian faith. As you value happiness, both here and hereafter, never lose sight of this beacon to the soul; and always bear in mind, that no faith can be genuine, which is not connected with a good moral life. “One of Harrison's reconnoitring or scouting parties fell in with the savages, (after our mounted men had driven them into the woods) killed four of their number, and retook two prisoners; the remainder escaped to the lake shore, where a large body of the enemy was assembled. “One of the re-captured prisoners is M`Dougal, husband of the murdered Susan. From his statement, combined with that of Catharine, and both taken in connexion with Fleming's letter, the following must be a tolerable correct account of the transactions at Fleming's, on that disastrous night: “The savages had fired the house, before any alarm was given; and the whole family narrowly escaped perishing in their beds. Each one flew, as fear impelled. Mrs. Fleming had fainted with terror, and her husband was bearing her in his arms towards the barn, when a shot passed under his left armpit, and entered her bosom; of this, however, he was ignorant, until he felt himself covered with blood. Scarcely had he entered the barn, when he was seized by the savages, who tore the bleeding sufferer from his arms, and dashed her on the cheerless floor. Raving like a fury, Fleming scuffled until he was completely overpowered; he was then forced away, and saw neither wife nor daughter more. “Catharine had fled some distance, but perceiving that none of her friends followed, she paused, and then as swiftly retraced her steps. The savages were retreating, the house wrapped in flames, and not a friend to be seen! O, George! what must have been the mental anguish of that poor girl! Shivering in the night air, from which she was protected only by her linen tunic; appalled by the yell of triumph which was reiterated ed by the painted monsters, as they departed in the full blaze of her burning mansion, and in total ignorance as to the fate of her parents! “While she stood aghast and horror-struck, gazing on the maddening spectacle before her, a deep groan issuing from within the barn (against which she was now leaning) attracted her attention. She immediately entered the building, and by the light of the flames, which shone through the expanded door, she recognised her dying mother, weltering in her own blood! Why did not the distressed girl's heart-strings crack at such a sight? Because God always gives strength equal to the task imposed. “She raised her mother's head on her knees, and endeavored to stanch the wound at which her life's blood was issuing---it was all she could do. “Speak to me, my dear mother, O, speak to your poor Catharine!” she several times exclaimed. Her mother opened her eyes, pressed her daughter's hand, and then faintly asked for her husband; but of his fate Catharine was also ignorant. “Fly, and leave me, Catharine; the flames will reach the barn.” “Then we will both die together, my mother,” was the sweet angel's reply---“there are no assassins in Heaven. The Indians are gone, and I fear not the fire.” Such was their situation, when we found them. “M`Dougal and his wife were seized as they issued from the house; she was struck on the head with a hatchet, but her husband was fortunately forced away too quickly to witness the subsequent barbarities inflicted on the wife of his bosom. “Fleming has a sister, who emigrated to this country with her family, some years before him self, and who is now a widow, residing in the village of Ithaca, in the state of New-York. Although she married in Belfast, her husband was an American, and owned several valuable estates on the shores of Cayuga Lake. His name was Woodcock; he has been dead about two years, and has left one son to inherit the bulk of his fortune. Mrs. Woodcock has repeatedly requested her brother to permit Catharine to spend a summer with her at Ithaca, urging that as there was but one daughter in the family, her time ought to be divided between the brother and sister. Mrs. Fleming, however, could not endure the thought of a separation from her daughter, and so the request of the aunt has never been complied with. But at Catharine's request, I have now written to Mrs. Woodcock on the subject, and given a history of our recent misfortunes; I have requested her answer to be directed to me at Erie, to which place I shall take her niece in a few days, as I think a change of scene and air will contribute to her restoration. As soon as I have settled my business here, and procured a suitable lad to drive my carriage, I shall depart; so, if you intend to write soon, direct to that place, also, as I shall spend several days there with our cousin Latamore. [22] [22] See vol. i. p. 68. From Ithaca, I shall proceed to Boston, and there reside, until the safety of these shores is secured, either by victory or peace. Adieu. “E. WILLOUGHBY.”</field>

On our arrival, a surgeon was procured, who immediately pronounced the wound of Mrs. Fleming to be mortal; and, in an hour afterwards, she expired. “The mounted riflemen who pursued the Indians, succeeded in driving them into the woods, killed two, and made one prisoner. I directed Logan to examine this Indian, and from his report I am convinced that Fleming has fallen into their hands alive and unhurt. Four of my little band were left lifeless in the orchard along with seven of the savages, who were all buried last evening in the spot where they fell. Most of the prisoners are severely wounded. Those who fell on the platform, are buried in the smoking ruins of the house. “Of the horrid transactions at Fleming's, I can give you no account, until Catharine becomes sufficiently composed to relate what passed under her observation. The body of Susan (who was married, soon after you left us, last summer, to a very worthy laborer on Fleming's plantation) was found at some distance from the barn, mangled in a manner too horrid for description—an unborn infant, which had been torn from her womb, lay near her feet, cloven nearly in two by a tomahawk! The unhappy husband is probably a prisoner with Fleming. The females of my family, who remained concealed in the woods until after sunrise, have arrived in safety at Cleveland. “The bodies of Mrs. Fleming and Susan, will be buried to-morrow, and will be followed by a larger procession of real mourners, than this place has ever exhibited on any former occasion. “Catharine is, at present, inconsolable; but “God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.” I have communicated the melancholy event to her uncle, William O'Hara, who has joined Perry's squadron at Erie, and holds some respectable office on board the commodore's brig. To-morrow I shall write to my friend Harrison, requesting him to exert his influence to procure the release of the prisoners on parole; or, at least, that of Fleming, whose presence would tend, more than any thing else, to restore the tranquility of Catharine's mind. “Logan will make no delay in flying to his preserver with this letter. If he can serve you in any thing, make him happy by employing him. A remittance, you must not expect; but if you are absolutely in want, draw on your uncle in Boston, and the draught will be duly honored. My loss is severe, as not a single article was saved at Mulberry Grove; but this is a loss which can soon be repaired. My crops bid fair to be excellent, and as I have now no barns, I shall sell them on the field. 40* “I shall write again soon, when you may expect further particulars. In the mean time, forget not to place a due reliance on Providence, who orders all things for the best; and still believe me to be, as ever, your affectionate father, “E. WILLOUGHBY.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Cleveland, Ohio, July 25, 1813. “I am happy, my dear boy, to inform you, that by a courier, who is travelling express from Harrison's head-quarters to Erie, I have received a letter from Fleming, written on board an English gun-boat in Sandusky Bay, just preparing to sail for Malden. He is anxious to learn the fate of his family, and fears the worst. Catharine herself has undertaken to relieve this suspense, by writing immediately, and as flags are frequently passing between the two armies, there will be no difficulty attending its conveyance, except the customary inspection of its contents, which is of no consequence. I am sensible of Harrison's disposition to oblige me, and he has promised to exert his influence in procuring Fleming's release. May the choicest blessings of Heaven rest upon the hero's head. “The certainty of yet possessing a father, although in captivity, has produced a happy effect on the mind of Catharine, whose grief has now subsided into a pensive calm. Her meek and humble reliance on the love and wisdom of her Heavenly Parent, has diffused a gentle quiet through her soul, which has already exhibited its beneficial influence on her bodily health. Such, my son, are the delightful effects of a genuine christian faith. As you value happiness, both here and hereafter, never lose sight of this beacon to the soul; and always bear in mind, that no faith can be genuine, which is not connected with a good moral life. “One of Harrison's reconnoitring or scouting parties fell in with the savages, (after our mounted men had driven them into the woods) killed four of their number, and retook two prisoners; the remainder escaped to the lake shore, where a large body of the enemy was assembled. “One of the re-captured prisoners is M`Dougal, husband of the murdered Susan. From his statement, combined with that of Catharine, and both taken in connexion with Fleming's letter, the following must be a tolerable correct account of the transactions at Fleming's, on that disastrous night: “The savages had fired the house, before any alarm was given; and the whole family narrowly escaped perishing in their beds. Each one flew, as fear impelled. Mrs. Fleming had fainted with terror, and her husband was bearing her in his arms towards the barn, when a shot passed under his left armpit, and entered her bosom; of this, however, he was ignorant, until he felt himself covered with blood. Scarcely had he entered the barn, when he was seized by the savages, who tore the bleeding sufferer from his arms, and dashed her on the cheerless floor. Raving like a fury, Fleming scuffled until he was completely overpowered; he was then forced away, and saw neither wife nor daughter more. “Catharine had fled some distance, but perceiving that none of her friends followed, she paused, and then as swiftly retraced her steps. The savages were retreating, the house wrapped in flames, and not a friend to be seen! O, George! what must have been the mental anguish of that poor girl! Shivering in the night air, from which she was protected only by her linen tunic; appalled by the yell of triumph which was reiterated ed by the painted monsters, as they departed in the full blaze of her burning mansion, and in total ignorance as to the fate of her parents! “While she stood aghast and horror-struck, gazing on the maddening spectacle before her, a deep groan issuing from within the barn (against which she was now leaning) attracted her attention. She immediately entered the building, and by the light of the flames, which shone through the expanded door, she recognised her dying mother, weltering in her own blood! Why did not the distressed girl's heart-strings crack at such a sight? Because God always gives strength equal to the task imposed. “She raised her mother's head on her knees, and endeavored to stanch the wound at which her life's blood was issuing---it was all she could do. “Speak to me, my dear mother, O, speak to your poor Catharine!” she several times exclaimed. Her mother opened her eyes, pressed her daughter's hand, and then faintly asked for her husband; but of his fate Catharine was also ignorant. “Fly, and leave me, Catharine; the flames will reach the barn.” “Then we will both die together, my mother,” was the sweet angel's reply---“there are no assassins in Heaven. The Indians are gone, and I fear not the fire.” Such was their situation, when we found them. “M`Dougal and his wife were seized as they issued from the house; she was struck on the head with a hatchet, but her husband was fortunately forced away too quickly to witness the subsequent barbarities inflicted on the wife of his bosom. “Fleming has a sister, who emigrated to this country with her family, some years before him self, and who is now a widow, residing in the village of Ithaca, in the state of New-York. Although she married in Belfast, her husband was an American, and owned several valuable estates on the shores of Cayuga Lake. His name was Woodcock; he has been dead about two years, and has left one son to inherit the bulk of his fortune. Mrs. Woodcock has repeatedly requested her brother to permit Catharine to spend a summer with her at Ithaca, urging that as there was but one daughter in the family, her time ought to be divided between the brother and sister. Mrs. Fleming, however, could not endure the thought of a separation from her daughter, and so the request of the aunt has never been complied with. But at Catharine's request, I have now written to Mrs. Woodcock on the subject, and given a history of our recent misfortunes; I have requested her answer to be directed to me at Erie, to which place I shall take her niece in a few days, as I think a change of scene and air will contribute to her restoration. As soon as I have settled my business here, and procured a suitable lad to drive my carriage, I shall depart; so, if you intend to write soon, direct to that place, also, as I shall spend several days there with our cousin Latamore. [22] [22] See vol. i. p. 68. From Ithaca, I shall proceed to Boston, and there reside, until the safety of these shores is secured, either by victory or peace. Adieu. “E. WILLOUGHBY.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LIII. A FURLOUGH. —Walk hence with that, And manage it against despairing thoughts Shakspeare. The army at Fort George was now in a state of inactivity, (excepting some trifling affairs of outposts) and George had much time for reflection; but his reflections were not always of the most pleasing kind. The counterfeit Reuben had disappeared, and no one knew what had become of him. Anxious to save from deeper ruin this infatuated victim of a criminal passion, our hero was indefatigable in his enquiries; and, at length, began to fear that the waves of Niagara had received the self-devoted wretch, whose parting words, he recollected, were, “I know my instrument, and shall have my revenge.” Had George deliberately studied, planned, and executed a scheme of seduction—had he, by specious promises, obtained the affections and confidence of an artless girl, and basely violated her honor---had he initiated her into the paths of vice, and then cruelly withdrawn his protection, abandoning her to shame and poverty—had this been the case, the self-immolation of his unhappy victim would have been revenge indeed---the severest wound in her power to inflict; a wound that could hardly fail “To bring repentance to her lover, “And wring his bosom.” But this was not the case; George had not been thus deeply guilty; and yet the bare idea that such might be the fate of the frail Sophia, filled his bosom with no very enviable sensations. He had sufficient cause for self-reproach; he consented to her ruin, without making an attempt to save her. Had he manfully resisted temptation, and set her a pattern of heroic virtue, she might have lived to thank him for the lesson. But, instead of supporting, he, alas! had fallen with her! In order, if possible, to divert such unpleasant reflections, he obtained a short furlough, to visit his father at Erie. I will not positively assert, that, in taking this step, he thought only of his father; of this, the reader is at liberty to judge for himself. I only know that he travelled to Erie with an expedition that would have done honor to an express courier. It would be difficult to determine which exhibited the greatest degree of surprise at the meeting, the major, at seeing his son—or his son at not seeing Catharine. The latter had departed several hours before, in company with her aunt and cousin, and was now far distant, on the road to Mayville, in the state of New-York. Our hero's velocity in travelling had actually prevented the interview he so ardently desired; he having passed the carriage which contained Catharine, too precipitately for either party to recognise each other. He was now almost tempted to pursue them, and accompany them to Ithaca; but the half-formed resolution was soon dissipated by reflection, and his chagrin quickly yielded to the native gentleness of his disposition. The major now proceeded to inform our hero, that as soon as his letter had reached Ithaca, Mrs. Woodcock, (accompanied by her son in his own carriage) set out immediately for Erie, and arrived but three days later than the major himself. As their carriage was much more comfortable than that in which he had travelled from Cleveland, he cheerfully resigned his fair charge to such protectors, and concluded to tarry a week longer in Erie. “Catharine (he added) is much improved in health and spirits since the date of my last letter. Could she again embrace her father, she would be comparatively happy. Nothing, my son, but genuine piety could have supported her under trials so peculiarly severe.” Perry's squadron was now lying in the harbor, having returned from a short cruise to receive reinforcements. Major Willoughby had received an invitation to dine with the commodore, on board the Lawrence, and his son resolved to accompany him. This was an unexpected pleasure to Perry, as it was also to the gallant Elliot, who had just arrived from Sacket's Harbor with one hundred volunteers for the squadron. Elliot had been appointed to the command of the Niagara, a vessel of equal force with the Lawrence; and besides these two brigs, which carried twenty guns each, there were in the harbor six others of inferior force. The whole were now completely manned and equipped, and every soul on board was panting to meet the enemy. After the cloth was removed, and the wine had begun to circulate, several toasts were given by different officers present. The major was solicited for a sentiment, and gave the following:— “The hero who voluntarily risks his own life, to preserve that of an individual, would think it no sacrifice to die for his country.” George knew not how to understand this sentiment, but the scarlet blush that mantled on the cheek of one 41 young officer at table, evinced to the whole company that it was not unintelligible to him. No notice, however, was taken of the circumstance, and the modest midshipman soon after retired. On reaching their lodgings, (to which they were accompanied by O'Hara) George requested an explanation of his father's toast, which was given by the major in the following words: “Yesterday evening, towards sunset, the weather being remarkably fine, Mrs. Latamore and myself prevailed on Catharine to accompany me in a little excursion on horseback, an exercise of which she is extremely fond, and which we now recommended as beneficial to her health. Her aunt approved the motion, and Catharine consented. We proceeded, at a gentle pace, on the Erie turnpike, about three miles. On our return, the report of a fowling-piece in an adjacent field, so frightened the animal on which Catharine was seated, that he became totally unmanageable, and after rearing and plunging a moment, set off towards the town with a speed truly alarming, and which the feeble Catharine was unable to check. Almost distracted for her safety, I urged on my more tardy beast, but was at some distance in the rear, when I observed a foot-passenger dart into the middle of the road, and, at the imminent hazard of his life or limbs, seize the bridle of her steed with one hand, while he caught the precipitated Catharine in the other arm—free from injury, save the effects of her fright. This was the noble youth alluded to in my toast, and he was present at table.” “That young midshipman?” “The same.” “May he become admiral of the whole American navy!” cried O'Hara, with an oath. “What would I not give to be that midshipman!” exclaimed George—and then blushed, as he met his father's smile. “Come, come, my son,” said the major—“do not compel me to chide you for selfishness. You have already had the privilege of saving Miss Fleming once, from even greater danger. Will not that suffice?” “Who is the happy fellow?” “All in good time, my son. On coming up to them, I sprang from my horse, and assisted in supporting the trembling girl, who assured me that she was perfectly safe and unhurt. She then turned to her deliverer, and thanked him with a grace peculiar to herself—possibly you may conceive of it, if she has ever thanked you for being the instrument of her deliverance at Richmond.” George again blushed. “I eagerly united with her,” continued the major, “in expressing our grateful sense of the obligation under which his gallantry had laid us; but he modestly declined every idea of merit in the achievement, said he could claim no gratitude for merely performing his duty, and begged us to inform him in what manner he could be of farther service. Catharine would not again trust herself on horseback, and, as the distance was small, she chose to proceed on foot. The young stranger then requested her to accept his right arm, while I supported her with my left, and throwing my bridle over the other shoulder, we commenced our march, with Catharine in the centre. As for her horse, he had not the politeness to await the result of his mad frolic, but was by this time, at his owner's stable in the borough. In this manner we reached our quarters, where the gallant officer took his leave.” “I must become acquainted with him,” exclaimed George. “Who is he?” “He merely informed me that his name was Webster; and I have learned from others, that he is a nephew of Noah Webster, esq. the celebrated etymologist of New-England. But if the squadron should not sail to-morrow, you may yet be introduced to him.” The conversation now turned upon the affairs of O'Hara, and his unfortunate relatives. The brave Irishman could hardly command his feelings while the subject was spoken of. “You recollect our conversation in Boston?” said O'Hara to George; “you then attempted to convince me that my resentment against Great Britain was wrong; and, in conformity to your advice, (which, I have no doubt, was well intended) I have endeavored to soften and suppress it. What is the consequence? `To whet my almost blunted purpose,' Heaven found it necessary to inflict another blow. That cruel blow has now been struck by the agents of England, and if I ever forgive her, may Heaven never forgive me! We shall soon meet them on Lake Erie, and then my motto shall be—“Revenge or Death.” Should my courage faulter, or my ardor flag, one glance at our family picture will rekindle both into a blaze of fury. The shades of a murdered sister—a heart-broken father—a martyred brother—shall pass in succession before my mental view, and nerve my bosom with a tiger's rage!” Finding him “in a humour to chide the thunder, if at him it grumbled,” our hero made no attempts to restrain the violence of his feelings, by any arguments or observations, but sought to change the subject. When the indignant sailor had given free vent to the fulness of his heart, he became more calm, and shortly after took his leave. The squadron sailed on the following day, and George was consequently deprived of the anticipated introduction to Webster. Early the next morning the major and his son departed for Buffalo, where they safely arrived on the third day of their journey. Major Willoughby spent several days with his son, which they occupied in visiting the different military works on the borders of Niagara; George pointed out to his father the various scenes of attack and defence, in the several skirmishes which had occurred during the obstinate contention for the possession of this river; explained the positions and manœuvres of the two vessels which Elliot surprised under the guns of Fort Erie, and the operations of the gallant Scott in affording them protection. George then directed his father's attention to the opposite shore, where the brave Boerstler, King, and Angus, effected their landing, on the twenty-eighth of November preceding, with a small body of sailors and soldiers.[23] [23] See note to page 115, of this volume. “This intrepid, but unfortunate little party,” continued George, “crossed the river under the impression that the main body of Smyth's army was to follow, as soon as the enemy's batteries were carried. They landed, yonder, at about three o'clock in the morning, under a severe fire of musketry and grape. Lieutenant Angus headed the gallant tars, who were armed with pikes and cutlasses, and he was assisted by captain 41* Craig, lieutenant Dudley, midshipman Graham, and sailing-master Watts; the latter, you recollect, distinguished himself in re-capturing the Caledonia.[24] [24] See vol. i—p. 270. Samuel Swartwout, esq. of New-York, who happened to be here at the time, volunteered his services on that occasion, and behaved like a soldier. Sixty regulars and fifty sailors, composed the whole of the American force; but bravery supplied the deficiency of numbers; and, after an obstinate contest, they succeeded in dispersing the enemy, storming his works, spiking the cannon, and making about fifty prisoners. “Every battery between Chippewa and Fort Erie, was now silent, and the Canadian shore, for more than fifteen miles, completely open for the reception of the American army, and yet they were not permitted to cross!—the boats therefore returned with the wounded and the prisoners, leaving the victorious King and twelve men, who would not be persuaded that the army were to be prohibited from coming over to their support, and they were consequently made prisoners by the enemy. “Out of twelve naval officers who were engaged in this enterprise, nine of them, with more than half their brave sailors, were killed or wounded. Watts fell at the head of his division, as he was gallantly leading them on. Captain Dox, who took a distinguished part in this affair, was severely wounded; as was, also, captains Morgan and Sproull, and lieutenant Lisson. Angus now commands the United States flotilla in the river Delaware. “My friend Graham, (a brave young midshipman, whose private virtues have secured him the love of all that know him) was so severely wounded in the leg as to render amputation necessary, which painful operation he endured with the calmness of a stoic. Indeed, sir, you must excuse me, if the love and admiration I express for my amiable friend, amount to enthusiasm; did you know him as I do, this apology were unnecessary.” “Who is the father of this brave youth?” “Colonel John A. Graham, of the city of New-York; a gentleman well known as a scholar and a patriot. Some time last winter, the George Clinton Society of New-York, resolved, by a unanimous vote, to present midshipman John A. Graham with an elegant SWORD, as a testimony of their high respect for his gallant conduct on the occasion I have mentioned; and this resolution was carried into effect on the fifth of April last. I will, if you please, read part of a letter on the subject, which I received from a correspondent who is a member of that Society, on the day before we sailed for Little York. The writer thus expresses himself: “Monday evening last had been previously appointed by our Society, for presenting an elegant sword to our mutual friend Graham, in honor of his gallant conduct, on the night of the twenty-seventh of November last, in spiking the enemy's cannon, &amp;c. on the shore opposite Black Rock. The meeting was, consequently, uncommonly numerous, and honored with the presence of most of the principal characters in the city. The sword was accompanied by a complimentary address from the president, (Osgood) to which our friend made an appropriate reply—modest, but dignified and patriotic. It was, indeed a most interesting spectacle—a subject worthy the pencil of West. Figure to yourself the venerable father, with a youthful son on each side, one of them (supported on crutches from the loss of a limb in his country's service) receiving from the hands of his fellow-citizens, a memorial of their approbation of his valor. The goddess of Liberty might be very aptly introduced, decorating with laurels the brow of her favorite votary. Every person present evinced the most lively sentiments of respect for the young hero, mingled with emotions of pity for his misfortune. The presence of his patriotic father, added not a little to the dignity of the scene. The mingled emotions of patriotism and paternal pride, were visibly depicted in his countenance, and I could scarcely help exclaiming aloud—“Who would not be a father!” I hope, my dear Willoughby, to see yourself the hero of a scene exactly similar—with the exception of the crutches. Instead of such appendages, be attended by your heroic father with but one hand; this would be an excellent substitute in the picture, and equally interesting. Adieu, “D. H. REINS.” On the following day George accompanied his father to visit the celebrated falls of Niagara. Thence they proceeded to Lewiston, about nine miles below, just at the foot of the northern terrace, as those sudden declivities are called which descend towards Lake Ontario. Some authors are of opinion that the great fall must, in former ages, have been at this place, and has since gradually worn away the rocky precipice down which it rushes, until it has travelled eight miles further south. A pleasant ride of six miles north of Lewiston, brought them to the village of Niagara, over which frown the battlements of a fortress bearing the same name. The river now only separated them from the American encampment at Fort George, and the village of Newark, of which they enjoyed a full view. “This fort (observed George, as they were viewing the outworks of Niagara) is perhaps one of the most important military posts in our country; and nothing but cowardice or treachery will ever change its flag. While we were embarking at Lewiston to attack Queenston, last October, the British opened a tremendous fire upon this place, from the opposite batteries, and continued to throw red-hot shot into these works for several hours. The compliment was, I assure you, returned with interest, although the garrison here was, at that time, but a handful of men. Several houses in Newark were set on fire by our shot, some of which were entirely consumed. The south battery (which you perceive is a very commanding one) was then commanded by captain M`Keon, who distinguished himself by his skill and firmness during the bombardment. The enemy, however, soon commenced throwing shells, and there being no defences against such intruders, and one of the principal batteries being nearly destroyed by the bursting of a cannon, which killed two men, the commandant (captain Leonard) ordered a retreat. But the garrison had scarcely left the fort, when the movements of the enemy indicated an intention to cross the river, and take possession; upon which the brave M`Keon immediately returned, with about twenty men, determined to defend or perish in the fort. The enemy, however, remained under the protection of their own batteries, and the next morning the remainder of our garrison rejoined their undaunted countrymen within the works. “A private belonging to this garrison, named Doyle, was made a prisoner with the rest of us at Queenston. His wife had in vain petitioned to have him paroled, and being incensed at the refusal of the British, she determined to perform her husband's duty against them, the next time these works should be assailed. An occasion soon offered, for at six o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of November following, they commenced a bombardment of this fort from five detached batteries, two of them mounting twenty-four pounders. The garrison here had been reinforced, but was not sufficiently supplied with artillery and ammunition. Colonel M`Feely had the command, and acquired great honor by his conduct on the occasion. Our Amazon was as good as her word, and attended the six-pounder on the mess-house, yonder, (which was commanded by Dr. Hooper) with hot shot from the furnace, regardless of the shells which were falling around her, and did not once quit her station during the whole affair. “In the course of the day the enemy threw two thousand red hot balls, and one hundred and eighty shells. Several of those buildings about the works were fired, but soon extinguished by the vigilance of the officers and men. Several houses were also fired on the opposite shore, and a British schooner was sunk at the wharf. Both officers and men, on this occasion, acquitted themselves with honor, but the distinguished ardor of a few will never be forgotten. I particularly allude to colonel M`Feely, colonel Gray, major Armistead, captains Mulligan, M`Keon, and Leonard; lieutenants Wendal, Gansevoort, Harris, Thomas, and Rees—the two last of whom were wounded.” When they had finished their survey, our hero accompanied his father to their lodgings in the village, within a few paces of which they passed an officer walking with a lady. A second look almost petrified George with astonishment—for it was Sophia, supported by the arm of Sandford! The recognition was mutual, but silent, and George entered his lodgings deeply ruminating on so singular an incident. On the following morning, major Willoughby took leave of his son, and departed for Albany, while George crossed the Niagara, entered the American encampment, and reported himself to the commandant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LIV. THE ENEMY REPULSED. They yield—they break—they fly! The victory is won! Behold!—they faint—they fall—they die! O stay!—The work is done. Spirit of Vengeance, rest! Sweet Mercy cries “forbear!” She clasps the vanquish'd to her breast, Thou wilt not pierce them there! Montgomery. On our hero's return to camp, he learned that, during his absence, Chauncey's squadron had come up the lake, received on board about three hundred regulars, under the command of Scott, and then proceeded to Little York, where Scott landed his men, and captured or destroyed all the public property and military stores which the enemy had deposited at that place since its first capture; they burnt the barracks, and took off all the sick and wounded prisoners surrendered by colonel Boerstler, at the battle of Beaver Dams.[25] [25] See p. 132 of this volume. They then re-embarked, and had returned, unmolested, to Fort George. Chauncey had again sailed in pursuit of the enemy's squadron. During the same period, the British had made a descent on Plattsburgh, a beautiful village, situate on the western margin of Lake Champlain, where they destroyed all the public property and military stores; but, not content with that, they had also wantonly burned several private ware-houses, and carried off an immense quantity of property belonging to individuals. Sandford was stationed in Fort Niagara, and had not yet “fleshed his maiden sword.” Young Logan had already distinguished himself in a successful attack on a body of Indians who had approached the pickets of Fort George. His little party succeeded in capturing and bringing in twelve of the British Indians, and several of their white allies, who were all treated with the greatest humanity by their generous captors. In a few days after our hero's return to the army, he received the following letter from O'Hara, whose merits had already been discerned by his commodore, and rewarded with an office of no inconsiderable trust and responsibility on board the Lawrence. This letter was dated— “United States brig Lawrence, Off Sandusky Bay, Aug. 18, 1813. “Dear Sir, “We arrived at this place on the evening of the thirteenth instant. By a pilot-boat, which was sent out for observation, a British sail was discovered at anchor near one of the islands, and the signal for chase was immediately made. By dark, we were almost within gunshot of the enemy; one hour more of day light, and she would have been captured. A very severe storm came on, and for fear of getting the squadron separated, we anchored for the night. Captain Richardson has gone on shore to proceed to Harrison's head-quarters at Seneca, and accompany the general down to the fleet. General Clay, the commandant at Fort Meigs, has received orders from Harrison to reduce the compass of that fort in such a manner as to enable three hundred men to hold it, and then march with the balance of his force to 42 head-quarters, at Seneca. Preparations are accordingly making to convey the stores, ammunition, and cannon, to Cleveland and Seneca, which it will take about ten days to accomplish. After these arrangements are completed, a force of five thousand troops, regulars and militia, will embark on board this squadron, and be conveyed to Malden, where Harrison will retrieve all that Hull lost. Previous to the embarkation, however, you may expect to hear that we are masters of the lake. “On the second instant, an affair took place at the head of this bay, which will immortalize a youthful hero, who is scarcely out of his teens. Captain Croghan, who you know has several times signalized himself in the Northwestern army, (particularly in the successful sortie from Fort Meigs, in May last) has recently been promoted to the rank of major, and appointed to the command of Fort Stephenson, formerly called Fort Sandusky, situated on Sandusky river, about twenty miles from our present anchorage. The situation of this post was considered by Harrison to be so defenceless and exposed, that he directed Croghan to evacuate it immediately on the approach of any considerable force of the enemy, after destroying the public property. “This gallant youth, however, ventured to disobey his commander, and saw his little garrison (of one hundred and sixty men) surrounded by an immense army of British and Indians, who had proceeded up the bay in gunboats, under the command of Proctor and Tecumseh. There was now no possibility of retreat, even if he had been so disposed, and Croghan determined to defend the fort to the last, in which determination he was supported by every officer and man. “The fort was encircled by a deep ditch, nine feet in width, which the enemy had to enter before he could approach the pickets, through the heads of which bayonets were driven in a horizontal direction. “After directing a tremendous cannonade, for several hours, against one angle of the fort, without producing a breach, the enemy determined to storm; and a close column of three hundred and fifty regulars was led on by a colonel Short, assisted by lieutenant Gordon, to make an attack on the bombarded angle. “O for that pen with which Miss Porter described the desperate contest on Dumbarton walls, that I might give you a just idea of this tremendous assault—this unparalleled defence. But as I am not in possession of her pen, I will do the best I can with my own. “The gallant Short advanced in the very face of death, while his followers were, more than once, thrown into confusion by the American fire. But again they rallied, and with accelerated motion, again pushed forward to the attack. In vain a `leaden hailstorm' beat upon the advancing phalanx; in vain the horrid engines of destruction vomited death from their iron throats: like a mighty torrent, the assailants still rushed onwards, scattering the dead and wounded in their crimsoned path. “For a moment they paused on the steep brink of the deep-yawning trench that encircled the fortress. “Leap the ditch!” exclaimed the intrepid leader of this undaunted column; “cut down the pickets! give no quarter! advance!” Instant, on the word, they poured down the bank like a mountain cataract, whose sounds are whispers to the clashing of their jostling arms. The ditch was filled, and a bristling row of iron pikes, fixed in the heads of the pickets, impaled several of the impetuous assailants. Again the voice of their leader urges them forward: “Scale the pickets, and show no quarter! Storm!” “This order was distinctly heard by the little Spartan band which those pickets protected. “At this moment, what had appeared to the assailants a blank bastion, flanking the ditch, suddenly exhibited the blazing throat of ordnance, from which so tremendous a shower of leaden slugs and musket balls descended upon the storming column, that scarcely a man escaped without a wound. The ditch ran with blood, and was piled with mangled heaps of the slain and the wounded. “Quarter!

Another shower of death swept through his disordered ranks, and he fell—waving in his hand a symbol of the mercy he claimed; and by his side fell the gallant Gordon.

      <field name="fulltext">“United States brig Lawrence, Off Sandusky Bay, Aug. 18, 1813. “Dear Sir, “We arrived at this place on the evening of the thirteenth instant. By a pilot-boat, which was sent out for observation, a British sail was discovered at anchor near one of the islands, and the signal for chase was immediately made. By dark, we were almost within gunshot of the enemy; one hour more of day light, and she would have been captured. A very severe storm came on, and for fear of getting the squadron separated, we anchored for the night. Captain Richardson has gone on shore to proceed to Harrison's head-quarters at Seneca, and accompany the general down to the fleet. General Clay, the commandant at Fort Meigs, has received orders from Harrison to reduce the compass of that fort in such a manner as to enable three hundred men to hold it, and then march with the balance of his force to 42 head-quarters, at Seneca. Preparations are accordingly making to convey the stores, ammunition, and cannon, to Cleveland and Seneca, which it will take about ten days to accomplish. After these arrangements are completed, a force of five thousand troops, regulars and militia, will embark on board this squadron, and be conveyed to Malden, where Harrison will retrieve all that Hull lost. Previous to the embarkation, however, you may expect to hear that we are masters of the lake. “On the second instant, an affair took place at the head of this bay, which will immortalize a youthful hero, who is scarcely out of his teens. Captain Croghan, who you know has several times signalized himself in the Northwestern army, (particularly in the successful sortie from Fort Meigs, in May last) has recently been promoted to the rank of major, and appointed to the command of Fort Stephenson, formerly called Fort Sandusky, situated on Sandusky river, about twenty miles from our present anchorage. The situation of this post was considered by Harrison to be so defenceless and exposed, that he directed Croghan to evacuate it immediately on the approach of any considerable force of the enemy, after destroying the public property. “This gallant youth, however, ventured to disobey his commander, and saw his little garrison (of one hundred and sixty men) surrounded by an immense army of British and Indians, who had proceeded up the bay in gunboats, under the command of Proctor and Tecumseh. There was now no possibility of retreat, even if he had been so disposed, and Croghan determined to defend the fort to the last, in which determination he was supported by every officer and man. “The fort was encircled by a deep ditch, nine feet in width, which the enemy had to enter before he could approach the pickets, through the heads of which bayonets were driven in a horizontal direction. “After directing a tremendous cannonade, for several hours, against one angle of the fort, without producing a breach, the enemy determined to storm; and a close column of three hundred and fifty regulars was led on by a colonel Short, assisted by lieutenant Gordon, to make an attack on the bombarded angle. “O for that pen with which Miss Porter described the desperate contest on Dumbarton walls, that I might give you a just idea of this tremendous assault—this unparalleled defence. But as I am not in possession of her pen, I will do the best I can with my own. “The gallant Short advanced in the very face of death, while his followers were, more than once, thrown into confusion by the American fire. But again they rallied, and with accelerated motion, again pushed forward to the attack. In vain a `leaden hailstorm' beat upon the advancing phalanx; in vain the horrid engines of destruction vomited death from their iron throats: like a mighty torrent, the assailants still rushed onwards, scattering the dead and wounded in their crimsoned path. “For a moment they paused on the steep brink of the deep-yawning trench that encircled the fortress. “Leap the ditch!” exclaimed the intrepid leader of this undaunted column; “cut down the pickets! give no quarter! advance!” Instant, on the word, they poured down the bank like a mountain cataract, whose sounds are whispers to the clashing of their jostling arms. The ditch was filled, and a bristling row of iron pikes, fixed in the heads of the pickets, impaled several of the impetuous assailants. Again the voice of their leader urges them forward: “Scale the pickets, and show no quarter! Storm!” “This order was distinctly heard by the little Spartan band which those pickets protected. “At this moment, what had appeared to the assailants a blank bastion, flanking the ditch, suddenly exhibited the blazing throat of ordnance, from which so tremendous a shower of leaden slugs and musket balls descended upon the storming column, that scarcely a man escaped without a wound. The ditch ran with blood, and was piled with mangled heaps of the slain and the wounded. “Quarter! Quarter!” exclaimed the colonel, “who had, a moment before, exhorted his men to give none; but he called too late. Another shower of death swept through his disordered ranks, and he fell—waving in his hand a symbol of the mercy he claimed; and by his side fell the gallant Gordon. In vain did the surviving officers without the ditch exert themselves to bring on a reinforcement; both columns fled in disorder before the destructive tempest that pursued them, and with their redoubtable leaders, Proctor and Tecumseh, sought for safety in the adjacent woods. “The din of battle now gradually subsided, until no sound was heard by the besieged but the distant yell of the savage, and the shricks and groans of the miserable wretches in the ditch; the latter were sounds which could not fail to melt with pity the brave hearts of American soldiers.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LV. BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS. Land of my fathers!—resplendant with glory, Thy genius shall rise o'er the ruin of time; Immortal thy fame, thou shalt live in the story, Splendid in peace—and in battle sublime! Red through the shadows that darken thy fountains, Again like a meteor the war-beacon streams; Deep are the thunders that roll from thy mountains, Martial the lustre on ocean that gleams. Edwin C. Holland, Esq. The encampment at Fort George was now closely invested by a combined army of British and Indians, under the command of sir George Prevost, and skirmishes were almost daily taking place between the pickets of the two armies, of trifling consequence to either party. But at day-break, on the twenty-fourth of August, the whole line of American outposts were attacked at the same instant, and driven in. Captain Vandalsem, who commanded a small guard on Butler's road, was surrounded, and cut off from the camp by the enemy; but instantly rallying his little party, he forced his way through a superior body, and brought his guards safely into the garrison. The enemy continued to advance, and was soon in possession of the village of Newark, but did not venture within musket-shot of the American entrenchments, his object being to draw the Americans out into the woods. Finding, however, that they would only act on the defensive against such superior force, and being now convinced that their position was much stronger than he had contemplated, he soon retreated beyond the reach of the American cannon, and again retired to his strong holds. The enemy lost fifteen killed and several wounded, besides a captain and ten privates who were made prisoners by the gallant captains Davenport and Delano. The loss of the Americans in this affair was five killed, and about thirty wounded and missing. The command of the Northern army had been recently assigned to general Wilkinson, with whom the secretary of war was now concerting a plan of operations to be immediately set on foot against the enemy's principal towns on the river St. Lawrence. To make arrangements for carrying this plan into execution, the general left Sacket's Harbor, (at which place the war department was now established) and proceeded to Fort George, where he arrived on the fifth of September; but was prevented by indisposition from making any immediate preparations for the contemplated enterprise. In the mean time, Chauncey was traversing the lake in every direction, attempting, in vain, to decide the question of superiority, by bringing the enemy's squadron to a general action. But such a step was not agreeable to their politic commodore, sir James Yeo. The wary knight was sensible that a definitive contest with Chauncey, would be virtually playing for the possession of Upper Canada, and he was not so rash a gamester as to risk a stake which was his own already. He therefore carefully avoided a general engagement, keeping the American squadron continually in pursuit, and thereby preventing all co-operation between the navy and army. By adhering to this policy he intended to lengthen out an inactive campaign, and keep the Americans in check, until the approach of winter should render their intended operations abortive. On the ninth of September Wilkinson formally assumed the command of Fort George and its dependencies, and only awaited the result of Chauncey's movements to commence the execution of his plan against Kingston and Montreal. A proposition was now made to Wilkinson by general P. B. Porter, general M`Clure, and colonel Chapin, that these three gentlemen should be permitted to raise a volunteer force of one thousand men, exclusive of Indians, and add to it as many of the militia on duty as would be willing to join them; that they should be furnished with four pieces of field artillery, with experienced officers and men to fight them, and that with this force they should be authorised to invade the enemy's country. This proposition was accepted, and these three patriots immediately commenced the organization of a volunteer force, with which they were to maintain the peninsula during the absence of Wilkinson. Our hero, with no inconsiderable satisfaction, now began to anticipate, a scene of activity in which he would be permitted to participate; and impatiently looked forward to the day when the main body of the army was to move from Fort George on the contemplated enterprise. The summer had passed away, and no essential advantage had been acquired over the enemy—no laurels had been gathered by the army—the autumn, he hoped, would produce a plentiful harvest. While he was banqueting on this hope, he received the following letter from his father: “Boston, September 10, 1813. “My dear Boy, “The last eastern mail has brought us the welcome news of Another Naval Victory, the particulars of which I will relate as far as they have been made public, before I descend to local and domestic subjects. “On the fifth instant, the United States brig Enterprise sailed from Portsmouth under the command of lieutenant Burrows, a young officer who served in the Mediterranean with honor and success, during our contention with the Barbary powers. On the next day, which was Sunday, she fell in with an English brig of equal force, called the Boxer, commanded by captain Blythe, who immediately ordered his colors nailed to the mast, fired a shot as a challenge, and bore down upon the Enterprise. The action commenced within half-pistol-shot, and was obstinately maintained for about three quarters of an hour, when the enemy cried for quarter, declaring that their colors were nailed, and could not be struck. “The gallant Burrows had been mortally wounded, by a musket ball, at the commencement of the battle, but refused to be taken from the deck, where he continued during the whole of the action, exhorting his officers to do their duty, and never suffer the flag to be struck. When the sword of his brave enemy was presented to him, he clasped his hands together and exclaimed— “I am satisfied—I die contented.” He was then carried below, and shortly after expired. Captain Blythe, of the Boxer, was also killed, being struck with a cannon ball. This gallant officer was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of the unfortunate Lawrence, in Halifax. “After the fall of Burrows, the command of the Enterprise devolved on lieutenant M`Call, whose cool and determined courage throughout the action, has received the warmest approbation of every officer on board. He conducted the prize into Portland on Monday last, and on the following day, the bodies of Burrows and Blythe were intombed with military honors. Burrows was in the twenty-eighth year of his age, and has left two amiable sisters to lament his loss. “The bodies of captain Lawrence, and lieutenant Ludlow, arrived at the navy-yard, (in Charleston, near Boston) on the third instant, having been brought from Halifax by captain Crowninshield, of Salem, at his own expense, for the purpose of bestowing on them funeral honors in their native country. On captain Crowninshield's return to Salem with the bodies of these heroes, they were publicly interred with every honor that a grateful town could bestow. In the mean time, Edward N. Coxe, esq. brother-in-law of Lawrence, proceeded to Salem for the purpose of receiving and conveying to New-York, the remains of that beloved and universally lamented hero. “On arriving at the Navy-Yard, the bodies were placed in covered waggons, and proceeded by land to New-York. This mode of conveyance became necessary, in consequence of the refusal of captain Oliver, who now commands the British squadron off New-London, (commodore Hardy having sailed for Halifax) to comply with the request made by commodore Decatur, that the bodies might be permitted to proceed round to New-York from Salem, in the cartel which brought them from Halifax. Such refusal was unworthy a brave enemy, and forms a striking contrast to the generous magnanimity which has characterized our naval commanders during the present war. “I arrived in this town on the thirtieth ultimo, after a very pleasant journey. On parting with you at Niagara, I proceeded to Batavia, where I tarried that night, and on the night following slept at Bloomfield, about thirty-six miles further. The next day at sunset, I crossed Cayuga Ferry, and took lodgings in the village, which is beautifully situated on the eastern margin of Cayuga lake. On taking a survey, the next morning, of the delightful scenery which surrounds this lake, I felt a strong desire to enjoy a sail on its pure and limpid bosom. This inclination for an aquatic excursion, was not, I assure you, much diminished by recollecting that the village of Ithaca was situated at the southern extremity of this inviting sheet of water, which is about forty miles in length, varying from one to four in breadth. “I soon struck a bargain with the owner of a handsome little pleasure-boat, who agreed to take me and my baggage to the head of the lake, while my young Jehu was directed to proceed to Ithaca with the waggon, along the Aurora turnpike, on the eastern shore. The wind was fair, and the day fine. We set sail about eight o'clock, and a more charming excursion I think I never enjoyed. The shore of this lake is considerably indented, and pleasingly irregular; in some places terminating in pecipices, but in general about ten or twelve feet high, with unbroken acclivities that rise from one to two hundred feet in about half a mile from the lake. The scenery, on each side, is beautifully picturesque, and is interspersed with little thriving villages that give it a very pleasing effect. I noticed Romulus and Ovid on the west, and Scipio, Aurora, Levana, and Genoa, on the east. In the town of Scipio, on the lake shore, stands the old Cayuga castle, the residence of the Cayuga Indians. Each of these villages, I was informed by the boatmen, contain a respectable academy, and a well selected library, and either of them must be an eligible situation for the education of youth, being far retired from the fascinations and luxuries of a city life, and blest with every charm within the gift of nature. “I discharged my boat, and entered Ithaca about four o'clock in the afternoon, waited on Mrs. Woodcock immediately, and found Catharine much improved in health. The roses were again beginning to bloom on her cheek, but are, I presume, frequently watered from her eyes. Her whole countenance was lighted with pleasure on seeing me, and she confessed that she had not, since the death of her mother, felt so happy as she did for the two days I tarried in Ithaca. “On taking leave of the hospitable family under whose protection Catharine remains, I proceeded to Homer, in the county of Cortland; thence to Sherburne, in Chenango county, and from thence to Cherry-Valley, in Otsego county. This village is beautifully situated in the principal vale of a large township bearing the same name, and is most romantically environed by high hills. Almost all the principal roads in the state of New-York intersect each other at this village, which gives it a great amount of trade and opulence. On leaving Cherry-Valley, I passed through Sharon, Cobelskill, Duanesburg, and Albany. Then took the great eastern road through Greenbush, 43 New-Lebanon Springs, and entered my native state in the town of Hancock. I then proceeded through Pittsfield, Northampton, Worcester and Cambridge, to Boston, where I arrived in safety, and found all our friends in good health. “While I was at Ithaca, Mr. Woodcock related to me a circumstance that deserves recording in your journal, if you have not already noticed it. You have doubtless heard Fleming mention a relative of his family named O'Fling, who assisted in establishing our independence, by serving through the revolutionary war as a private soldier, from motives of patriotism alone. Some time last January, he repaired to a rendezvous at Batavia, with four of his sons, who all enlisted (together with their father) as privates in the United States army, for five years. “This instance of disinterested patriotism, is not, however, without a parallel. About a month after the foregoing event, one of the venerable heroes of Saratoga and his four sons presented themselves at the rendezvous of lieutenant Loring, in Burlington, (Vt.) for the purpose of enlisting under the banners of their country. `I thought,' says the aged veteran, `that we had taught Britain a lesson that she would not have forgotten in my day, but we will show her that a nation of freemen is irresistible. I was then what my boys are now, yet am still able to push a bayonet in defence of my injured country!' Heath is the name of these worthies. They all resided in Johnston—the eldest son is thirty-one, the youngest nineteen years of age. “Spare no pains to obtain some intelligence of Fleming. Write often, and believe me to be, as heretofore, your affectionate father. “E. WILLOUGHBY.” While George was reading the foregoing letter, a courier arrived at the encampment, with advices to Wilkinson of a very important nature, being no less than accounts of a decisive battle having been fought on Lake Erie, in which the Americans were completely victorious, having captured every vessel belonging to the British squadron. As soon as this intelligence was permitted to transpire, a loud hum of joy ran through the camp, and heartfelt gratulations were mutually interchanged among both officers and men. In two days afterwards our hero received the following letter from O'Hara: “Sandusky Bay, Sept. 16, 1813. “You was right, my dear Willoughby—“Revenge will not remedy the evil.” British blood has flowed in torrents, and still I am the last remaining twig on our family tree; nor can all the blood that flows in English veins, resuscitate the other branches, or restore my lost happiness. We have had a battle, and hundreds of Englishmen are laid low—many of them beneath the waters of Erie. The survivors are our prisoners, and I have conversed with many of them who would willingly die for their country, but who loudly condemn the conduct of those ministers whose ambition has plunged them into a war with their brethren. It is the blood of such men, the blood of our brethren, that has so lavishly crimsoned the waves of this lake, and their blood will cry for vengeance on those ambitious wretches who guide the counsels of England. You was right—these men, whom I have been so eager to destroy, do `commiserate my sufferings, and denounce the authors of them.' Every English groan that has saluted my ears since the battle, has caused me to confess—`that was not the voice which decreed my brother's death; that man had no hand in dragging me on board a British ship; he never employed an Indian to murder my sister; why then should I rejoice at his sufferings?' I do not; I am a convert to your doctrine, and my present tenderness to those poor wounded men who are placed under my care, shall in some measure atone for my former error. “On the tenth instant, early in the morning, while we were lying in Put-in-Bay, a man from the mast-head cried out “a fleet!” The signal was immediately made for getting under weigh, and our squadron then beat out of the bay, to meet the enemy's, which we perceived consisted of two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop, with their larboard tacks on board, standing to the south, under easy sail. The wind was, at this time, about south-west, and we manœuvred in such a manner as to preserve the weathergage of the enemy. At ten o'clock the signal was made for forming in line of battle, when the Lawrence led the van, with the schooners Ariel and Scorpion, on our weather bow. We were followed in succession by the Caledonia, Niagara, Porcupine, Somers, Tigress, and Tripp. The ship Detroit led the enemy's van, followed by the Hunter, Queen Charlotte, Lady Prevost, Chippeway, and Little Belt. “All was now profound silence on board both squadrons; the wind was light, and we slowly approached each other in awful majesty. Suddenly, (and unexpectedly to every man in the squadron except a few officers on board our brig) a large Union Jack was run up to our mast head, on which could be distinctly read throughout the fleet, the dying words of that hero whose name this vessel bears—“Don't give up the ship.” At sight of it, such a burst of feeling arose from every bosom, as might almost have been heard from Erie to Malden. “At about eleven o'clock the exhilirating notes of a bugle sounded from the enemy's van ship, which was followed by reiterated huzzas from the crews of the different vessels in their squadron. “About noon we had approached within a mile and a half of each other, when the Detroit, which mounted long guns, opened a heavy fire upon the Lawrence, which we were unable to return, owing to the shortness of ours. Without waiting for the schooners, which now fell astern, our commodore kept on his course in such a gallant and determined style, that the enemy supposed it was our intention to board. Having gained a nearer position, Perry directed us to return the enemy's fire; but the length of their guns gave them greatly the advantage, enabling them to place a shot just where they pleased, while ours fell short of them; thus the poor Lawrence was pierced through and through, with a third of her crew disabled, before we could make the enemy feel a single shot. “It now evidently appeared, that the plan of the British commodore was to destroy this ship, and thus throw the squadron into confusion. For that purpose the fire of all his heaviest guns was directed at the Lawrence alone, leaving our other vessels unmolested. Signal was now made for closing with the enemy, but this ship soon became so crippled that she was perfectly unmanageable, 43* every brace and bowline being cut away, and in this situation we sustained the fight for above two hours, and for a great part of that time, could only get three or four guns to bear upon the foe. In the mean time, our men were rapidly cut down at their quarters, while others stept into their places, to share the same fate. The wounded were carried below, but the dead remained where they fell. Our ship was reduced to a mere wreck; the decks were streaming with blood, and covered with mangled limbs and dead bodies. One gun after another was dismounted, and the commodore himself assisted to work the last that could be fired. “Finding, at length, that we could no longer annoy the enemy from this ship, the gallant commodore directed a boat to be lowered from the stern, and manned; he then ordered his union jack to be hauled down, which he deliberately placed under his arm, gave the command of the Lawrence to lieutenant Yarnell, and sprang into the boat, directing his men to pull for the Niagara, which was then hotly engaged. He first, however, called to the pilot, and told him that he might either accompany him or remain on board the Lawrence. “I will stick by you to the last!” exclaimed the brave fellow, and leaped into the boat after his commander. “Pull away, my brave boys!” exclaimed the hero, gallantly waving his sword, standing erect in the stern of the boat, while the balls whistled around him like a shower of hail. An old sailor, who had been in both battles of the Constitution, entreated him to be seated, and finally forcibly pulled him down from his elevated situation. For a moment the enemy's fire was diverted from this devoted ship, and directed against the little bark which we now watched in breathless anxiety. But in vain were whole broadsides levelled at it—in vain the whole musketry of two vessels were poured around it— that little bark contained a greater than Cæsar, and passed through a shower of shot without receiving one on board. In a few minutes we hailed with transport his inspiring flag hoisted at the mast-head of the Niagara, and beheld that noble brig, dash, like a demon of vengeance, through the enemy's line, raking right and left as she past, pouring destruction on every side. In the next moment she was lying yard-arm and yard-arm with the British commodore. The smaller vessels followed in order, under the direction of Elliot, and the contest began to assume a more promising aspect. “In the mean time, the Lawrence (having sustained the whole fury of the enemy) was wholly incapable of any further defence, and a show of resistance was only drawing destruction on the relics of our mangled crew, many of whom were killed in the steerage while under the surgeon's hands. The brave Yarnell, therefore, ordered our flag to be struck, and our brig hauled out of the line; but the enemy being now too closely engaged to take possession of us, our flag was again hoisted, while the red-cross of England descended, in succession, on board of every vessel in the enemy's squadron, except two small ones who attempted to escape, but were chased and brought back by two of our small craft. “Thus, by the unparalleled skill and bravery of Perry, (whom every officer and seaman acknowledges to be the saviour, under Heaven, of the American squadron) we find ourselves in possession of the ship Detroit, of twenty guns, large twenty-four pounders; ship Queen Charlotte, of nineteen guns; brig Hunter, of ten guns; schooner Lady Prevost, of twelve guns; schooner Chippeway, of one gun; and the sloop Little Belt, of two guns. So that the American squadron is increased by the addition of six vessels and sixty-four guns, while the enemy have not a single gun afloat on this lake. “The engagement lasted about three hours, and never was victory more decisive and complete. The captured squadron, you perceive, exceeds ours in number of guns as well as weight of metal; their crews were more numerous, and more prisoners were taken than we had men to guard them. The loss on both sides is severe; scarcely a man on board this brig has escaped unhurt. I have, myself, however, fortunately come off with a mere scratch in the breast, where a splinter struck me. On board the Lawrence there were twenty-two killed and sixty-one wounded, although thirty-one of our crew were on the sick list, and unfit for duty. Our total loss throughout the squadron is twenty-seven killed, and ninety-six wounded—a pretty strong evidence that our brig bore the brunt of the action. The day before the action, there were one hundred and sixteen men in the squadron reported unfit for duty. “I am unable to state the loss of the enemy; it must, however, have been immense, as several of their vessels are literally cut to pieces; so much so, that the masts of the two ships were all carried away by the board, in a slight gale after the battle, owing to their being so severely wounded in the action. Barclay, the British commodore, has done himself great honor by the gallant manner in which he fought his squadron. Twice was he carried below on account of his wounds, and as often returned again upon deck. Little did I think, when compelled to fight under this same brave officer, in the battle of Trafalgar, that I should ever fight against him. But so it is— “There is a divinity that shapes our ends, “Rough-hew them how we will.” I was also in an engagement with him afterwards, with a French ship, when he lost his arm. He is a fine-looking officer, about thirty-six years old, and has seen much service. A shot from our ship deprived him of his remaining hand. The first care of our humane commodore, after the battle, was to attend to the comfort of the suffering crews of both squadrons. The sick and wounded are taken care of in the most tender manner, and the officers who have fallen on both sides, were buried last Sunday morning with the honors of war, on an island in the lake. “The prisoners have been landed at Sandusky, and Perry has requested Harrison to have them marched to Chilicothe, until the pleasure of government respecting them is known. Perry is now on board the Ariel, and Yarnell has been directed to take the Lawrence to Erie, with all the wounded of our fleet, as this ship is so cut up, that it will not be safe to keep her on the lake until repaired. “By this time I suppose you are anxious to see the names of those who have distinguished themselves on this occasion. Well, then, attend.— Next to the god-like Perry, (whose exalted merits are far above the reach of any commendation my humble pen can bestow) stands the gallant Elliott, and the greatest praise that can be bestowed on either of these heroes, is to say, that each of them was himself—he that is more, is more than man. When Perry arrived on board of the Niagara, after leaving his own ship, Elliott discovered that an important part of the fleet had assumed improper positions, and immediately volunteered his services to pass the whole of the enemy's line, bring up these vessels, and place them in a position better calculated to annoy the enemy. The gallant offer was accepted; and Elliott passed down the whole line, in a small boat, while the enemy's fire was so incessant, that his clothes were wet by the water which was dashed on him by the balls that fell around his boat. In this manner he proceeded to our gun-boats, and ordered them to make sail, and follow him; they did so, and he placed them under the sterns of the enemy's two heaviest ships, which placed the latter between two raking fires, and accelerated their surrender. “His eye was every where, and he soon observed that the guns of the Somers were not well served nor properly pointed; he therefore went on board that vessel, and fired the thirty-two-pounder three times himself, while Perry had brought the Niagara into the midst of the enemy's line, where she was spouting fire from both sides at once. These manœuvres decided the contest. “Next to Elliott, I will mention the undaunted Yarnell, who, though several times wounded, refused to quit the deck. The officers, generally, wore short-jackets, to prevent their being picked off by the enemy's sharp shooters; and Yarnell was also dressed as a common sailor. A red bandanna handkerchief was tied round his neck, and another round his head, to stanch two wounds he had received. From these the blood trickled down his face, and a splinter having passed through his nose, it had swelled to a hideous magnitude. In this frightful plight, looking like the very genius of carnage and ill luck, he came up to Perry, in the hottest and bloodiest of the fight, and announced to him that all the officers of his division were killed. Perry ordered others in their place. Shortly after, Yarnell returned with a repetition of the dismal tidings, that all the officers were shot down: `Then, sir,' said Perry, `you must endeavor to make out by yourself. I have no more to furnish you.' Perry escaped unhurt, as did also his brother, a young midshipman on board the Lawrence. “Webster, as I predicted, `acted well his part, and there all the honor lies.' He acted as sailing master on board the Niagara, and in breaking the enemy's line, no officer ever excelled him. Even the enemy have extolled the gallant style in which the Niagara was brought into close action, and the name of Webster has been publicly commended by the commodore. The young hero now acts as lieutenant, and Perry has assured him that the first mail from Washington will furnish him with a commission bearing date the tenth of this month. Thus may bravery ever be rewarded. “The following officers are spoken of as having signalized themselves on this brilliant occasion: lieutenants Brooks, Smith, Edwards, Turner, and Packet; midshipmen Forest, Lamb, Clarke, Claxton, and Swartwout; sailing master Taylor and Champlin; pursers M`Grath and Hambleton; and captain Brevoort, of the army, who acted as a volunteer, in the capacity of a marine officer, on board the Niagara, and did great execution with his rifle. Brooks, Lamb, and Clarke, are fallen, no more to rise. Hambleton, who volunteered his services on deck, was severely wounded, late in the action. Claxton and Swartwout are also badly wounded. “So much for officers—but heroism is not always distinguished by an epaulet. A seaman named Hall, in one of the gun-boats, observing the last remaining sponge fall overboard, without which the long gun would have been useless, plunged into the waves and caught it—his comrades seized the end of the sponge and drew him on board, and then again poured away into the enemy. “James Bird, son of J. Bird, of Exeter, in the state of New-Hampshire, was on board the Lawrence, and did his duty like a hero. His comrades fell thick around him, but he stood at his post firm and undismayed. At length a canister shot struck him on the shoulder, as he was stooping to his gun, and he was instantly covered with blood. His officer ordered him below, but he ventured to disobey, preferring to do his duty while he had life, to abandoning his post. The blood flowed so fast, that another order was issued to go below; when he ran down, got a hasty bandage on the wound, and returned again upon deck. Although his left arm was now useless, yet he handed cartridges, and performed every service in his power, with his right, until the stars and stripes waved gloriously over the foe. “Two Indian Chiefs had been stationed in the tops of the Detroit, to pick off our officers with their rifles. No sooner, however, did the ships come into close action, than they were dismayed by this new and tremendous species of battle, and slunk into the hold. When the ship was taken, they anticipated cruel treatment, if their nation was discovered, and therefore borrowed sailors' clothes, that they might pass for Englishmen. Thus disguised, they lay in close concealment for two days, when word was brought to Perry, that two Indians were concealed below, who had not tasted food for eight-and-forty hours. He had them brought up on deck, where they made a most uncouth and ludicrous appearance, with their borrowed garments bagging about them. They expected nothing less than to be butchered and scalped; but, notwithstanding, preserved the most taciturn inflexibility of muscle. Perry, however, after putting a few good humoured questions to them, ordered them to be taken away and fed; a degree of lenity which seemed to strike them with more surprise than their stoic natures are apt to evince. “Our surgeon relates an anecdote which may serve to show the cool intrepidity of our seamen, and their propensity to extract amusement from the most frivolous incident—even amid the horrors of a sanguinary battle. That part of the Lawrence which was appropriated for the purpose of a cockpit, was exposed to the enemy's shot, and there the wounded and dying lay strewn about in such numbers, that the feet of the surgeon sank in blood and gore, which had acquired the consistency of mud. We had a dog on board, and confined him to this place during the action, that 44 he might not be in the way on deck. At every new discharge of the enemy's guns, he howled most pitiously for mercy; but as soon as a partial silence succeeded, he would growl and bark defiance at the enemy. A shot at length opened day-light on that scene of gloom and horror, when the dog immediately thrust his head through the shot-hole and howled for quarters. The strange conduct of this terrified animal, the surgeon assures me, so diverted the wounded and dying, that they burst into loud and intemperate peals of laughter. “Your relation, Mr. Latamore, of Erie, is now on board this vessel; he sets out on his return home to-morrow, and has promised to forward this letter to you with all convenient haste. We proceed for the same place immediately, but as the wind is ahead, he will outsail us on horseback. He informs me that young Croghan has been rewarded for his gallantry at Fort Sandusky, in the best possible way that a young hero could wish to be rewarded—by the fair. The ladies of Chilicothe, it appears, have presented him an elegant sword, as a testimony of their respect for his bravery and patriotism; and government has promoted him to the rank of colonel.

      <field name="fulltext">“Boston, September 10, 1813. “My dear Boy, “The last eastern mail has brought us the welcome news of Another Naval Victory, the particulars of which I will relate as far as they have been made public, before I descend to local and domestic subjects. “On the fifth instant, the United States brig Enterprise sailed from Portsmouth under the command of lieutenant Burrows, a young officer who served in the Mediterranean with honor and success, during our contention with the Barbary powers. On the next day, which was Sunday, she fell in with an English brig of equal force, called the Boxer, commanded by captain Blythe, who immediately ordered his colors nailed to the mast, fired a shot as a challenge, and bore down upon the Enterprise. The action commenced within half-pistol-shot, and was obstinately maintained for about three quarters of an hour, when the enemy cried for quarter, declaring that their colors were nailed, and could not be struck. “The gallant Burrows had been mortally wounded, by a musket ball, at the commencement of the battle, but refused to be taken from the deck, where he continued during the whole of the action, exhorting his officers to do their duty, and never suffer the flag to be struck. When the sword of his brave enemy was presented to him, he clasped his hands together and exclaimed— “I am satisfied—I die contented.” He was then carried below, and shortly after expired. Captain Blythe, of the Boxer, was also killed, being struck with a cannon ball. This gallant officer was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of the unfortunate Lawrence, in Halifax. “After the fall of Burrows, the command of the Enterprise devolved on lieutenant M`Call, whose cool and determined courage throughout the action, has received the warmest approbation of every officer on board. He conducted the prize into Portland on Monday last, and on the following day, the bodies of Burrows and Blythe were intombed with military honors. Burrows was in the twenty-eighth year of his age, and has left two amiable sisters to lament his loss. “The bodies of captain Lawrence, and lieutenant Ludlow, arrived at the navy-yard, (in Charleston, near Boston) on the third instant, having been brought from Halifax by captain Crowninshield, of Salem, at his own expense, for the purpose of bestowing on them funeral honors in their native country. On captain Crowninshield's return to Salem with the bodies of these heroes, they were publicly interred with every honor that a grateful town could bestow. In the mean time, Edward N. Coxe, esq. brother-in-law of Lawrence, proceeded to Salem for the purpose of receiving and conveying to New-York, the remains of that beloved and universally lamented hero. “On arriving at the Navy-Yard, the bodies were placed in covered waggons, and proceeded by land to New-York. This mode of conveyance became necessary, in consequence of the refusal of captain Oliver, who now commands the British squadron off New-London, (commodore Hardy having sailed for Halifax) to comply with the request made by commodore Decatur, that the bodies might be permitted to proceed round to New-York from Salem, in the cartel which brought them from Halifax. Such refusal was unworthy a brave enemy, and forms a striking contrast to the generous magnanimity which has characterized our naval commanders during the present war. “I arrived in this town on the thirtieth ultimo, after a very pleasant journey. On parting with you at Niagara, I proceeded to Batavia, where I tarried that night, and on the night following slept at Bloomfield, about thirty-six miles further. The next day at sunset, I crossed Cayuga Ferry, and took lodgings in the village, which is beautifully situated on the eastern margin of Cayuga lake. On taking a survey, the next morning, of the delightful scenery which surrounds this lake, I felt a strong desire to enjoy a sail on its pure and limpid bosom. This inclination for an aquatic excursion, was not, I assure you, much diminished by recollecting that the village of Ithaca was situated at the southern extremity of this inviting sheet of water, which is about forty miles in length, varying from one to four in breadth. “I soon struck a bargain with the owner of a handsome little pleasure-boat, who agreed to take me and my baggage to the head of the lake, while my young Jehu was directed to proceed to Ithaca with the waggon, along the Aurora turnpike, on the eastern shore. The wind was fair, and the day fine. We set sail about eight o'clock, and a more charming excursion I think I never enjoyed. The shore of this lake is considerably indented, and pleasingly irregular; in some places terminating in pecipices, but in general about ten or twelve feet high, with unbroken acclivities that rise from one to two hundred feet in about half a mile from the lake. The scenery, on each side, is beautifully picturesque, and is interspersed with little thriving villages that give it a very pleasing effect. I noticed Romulus and Ovid on the west, and Scipio, Aurora, Levana, and Genoa, on the east. In the town of Scipio, on the lake shore, stands the old Cayuga castle, the residence of the Cayuga Indians. Each of these villages, I was informed by the boatmen, contain a respectable academy, and a well selected library, and either of them must be an eligible situation for the education of youth, being far retired from the fascinations and luxuries of a city life, and blest with every charm within the gift of nature. “I discharged my boat, and entered Ithaca about four o'clock in the afternoon, waited on Mrs. Woodcock immediately, and found Catharine much improved in health. The roses were again beginning to bloom on her cheek, but are, I presume, frequently watered from her eyes. Her whole countenance was lighted with pleasure on seeing me, and she confessed that she had not, since the death of her mother, felt so happy as she did for the two days I tarried in Ithaca. “On taking leave of the hospitable family under whose protection Catharine remains, I proceeded to Homer, in the county of Cortland; thence to Sherburne, in Chenango county, and from thence to Cherry-Valley, in Otsego county. This village is beautifully situated in the principal vale of a large township bearing the same name, and is most romantically environed by high hills. Almost all the principal roads in the state of New-York intersect each other at this village, which gives it a great amount of trade and opulence. On leaving Cherry-Valley, I passed through Sharon, Cobelskill, Duanesburg, and Albany. Then took the great eastern road through Greenbush, 43 New-Lebanon Springs, and entered my native state in the town of Hancock. I then proceeded through Pittsfield, Northampton, Worcester and Cambridge, to Boston, where I arrived in safety, and found all our friends in good health. “While I was at Ithaca, Mr. Woodcock related to me a circumstance that deserves recording in your journal, if you have not already noticed it. You have doubtless heard Fleming mention a relative of his family named O'Fling, who assisted in establishing our independence, by serving through the revolutionary war as a private soldier, from motives of patriotism alone. Some time last January, he repaired to a rendezvous at Batavia, with four of his sons, who all enlisted (together with their father) as privates in the United States army, for five years. “This instance of disinterested patriotism, is not, however, without a parallel. About a month after the foregoing event, one of the venerable heroes of Saratoga and his four sons presented themselves at the rendezvous of lieutenant Loring, in Burlington, (Vt.) for the purpose of enlisting under the banners of their country. `I thought,' says the aged veteran, `that we had taught Britain a lesson that she would not have forgotten in my day, but we will show her that a nation of freemen is irresistible. I was then what my boys are now, yet am still able to push a bayonet in defence of my injured country!' Heath is the name of these worthies. They all resided in Johnston—the eldest son is thirty-one, the youngest nineteen years of age. “Spare no pains to obtain some intelligence of Fleming. Write often, and believe me to be, as heretofore, your affectionate father. “E. WILLOUGHBY.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sandusky Bay, Sept. 16, 1813. “You was right, my dear Willoughby—“Revenge will not remedy the evil.” British blood has flowed in torrents, and still I am the last remaining twig on our family tree; nor can all the blood that flows in English veins, resuscitate the other branches, or restore my lost happiness. We have had a battle, and hundreds of Englishmen are laid low—many of them beneath the waters of Erie. The survivors are our prisoners, and I have conversed with many of them who would willingly die for their country, but who loudly condemn the conduct of those ministers whose ambition has plunged them into a war with their brethren. It is the blood of such men, the blood of our brethren, that has so lavishly crimsoned the waves of this lake, and their blood will cry for vengeance on those ambitious wretches who guide the counsels of England. You was right—these men, whom I have been so eager to destroy, do `commiserate my sufferings, and denounce the authors of them.' Every English groan that has saluted my ears since the battle, has caused me to confess—`that was not the voice which decreed my brother's death; that man had no hand in dragging me on board a British ship; he never employed an Indian to murder my sister; why then should I rejoice at his sufferings?' I do not; I am a convert to your doctrine, and my present tenderness to those poor wounded men who are placed under my care, shall in some measure atone for my former error. “On the tenth instant, early in the morning, while we were lying in Put-in-Bay, a man from the mast-head cried out “a fleet!” The signal was immediately made for getting under weigh, and our squadron then beat out of the bay, to meet the enemy's, which we perceived consisted of two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop, with their larboard tacks on board, standing to the south, under easy sail. The wind was, at this time, about south-west, and we manœuvred in such a manner as to preserve the weathergage of the enemy. At ten o'clock the signal was made for forming in line of battle, when the Lawrence led the van, with the schooners Ariel and Scorpion, on our weather bow. We were followed in succession by the Caledonia, Niagara, Porcupine, Somers, Tigress, and Tripp. The ship Detroit led the enemy's van, followed by the Hunter, Queen Charlotte, Lady Prevost, Chippeway, and Little Belt. “All was now profound silence on board both squadrons; the wind was light, and we slowly approached each other in awful majesty. Suddenly, (and unexpectedly to every man in the squadron except a few officers on board our brig) a large Union Jack was run up to our mast head, on which could be distinctly read throughout the fleet, the dying words of that hero whose name this vessel bears—“Don't give up the ship.” At sight of it, such a burst of feeling arose from every bosom, as might almost have been heard from Erie to Malden. “At about eleven o'clock the exhilirating notes of a bugle sounded from the enemy's van ship, which was followed by reiterated huzzas from the crews of the different vessels in their squadron. “About noon we had approached within a mile and a half of each other, when the Detroit, which mounted long guns, opened a heavy fire upon the Lawrence, which we were unable to return, owing to the shortness of ours. Without waiting for the schooners, which now fell astern, our commodore kept on his course in such a gallant and determined style, that the enemy supposed it was our intention to board. Having gained a nearer position, Perry directed us to return the enemy's fire; but the length of their guns gave them greatly the advantage, enabling them to place a shot just where they pleased, while ours fell short of them; thus the poor Lawrence was pierced through and through, with a third of her crew disabled, before we could make the enemy feel a single shot. “It now evidently appeared, that the plan of the British commodore was to destroy this ship, and thus throw the squadron into confusion. For that purpose the fire of all his heaviest guns was directed at the Lawrence alone, leaving our other vessels unmolested. Signal was now made for closing with the enemy, but this ship soon became so crippled that she was perfectly unmanageable, 43* every brace and bowline being cut away, and in this situation we sustained the fight for above two hours, and for a great part of that time, could only get three or four guns to bear upon the foe. In the mean time, our men were rapidly cut down at their quarters, while others stept into their places, to share the same fate. The wounded were carried below, but the dead remained where they fell. Our ship was reduced to a mere wreck; the decks were streaming with blood, and covered with mangled limbs and dead bodies. One gun after another was dismounted, and the commodore himself assisted to work the last that could be fired. “Finding, at length, that we could no longer annoy the enemy from this ship, the gallant commodore directed a boat to be lowered from the stern, and manned; he then ordered his union jack to be hauled down, which he deliberately placed under his arm, gave the command of the Lawrence to lieutenant Yarnell, and sprang into the boat, directing his men to pull for the Niagara, which was then hotly engaged. He first, however, called to the pilot, and told him that he might either accompany him or remain on board the Lawrence. “I will stick by you to the last!” exclaimed the brave fellow, and leaped into the boat after his commander. “Pull away, my brave boys!” exclaimed the hero, gallantly waving his sword, standing erect in the stern of the boat, while the balls whistled around him like a shower of hail. An old sailor, who had been in both battles of the Constitution, entreated him to be seated, and finally forcibly pulled him down from his elevated situation. For a moment the enemy's fire was diverted from this devoted ship, and directed against the little bark which we now watched in breathless anxiety. But in vain were whole broadsides levelled at it—in vain the whole musketry of two vessels were poured around it— that little bark contained a greater than Cæsar, and passed through a shower of shot without receiving one on board. In a few minutes we hailed with transport his inspiring flag hoisted at the mast-head of the Niagara, and beheld that noble brig, dash, like a demon of vengeance, through the enemy's line, raking right and left as she past, pouring destruction on every side. In the next moment she was lying yard-arm and yard-arm with the British commodore. The smaller vessels followed in order, under the direction of Elliot, and the contest began to assume a more promising aspect. “In the mean time, the Lawrence (having sustained the whole fury of the enemy) was wholly incapable of any further defence, and a show of resistance was only drawing destruction on the relics of our mangled crew, many of whom were killed in the steerage while under the surgeon's hands. The brave Yarnell, therefore, ordered our flag to be struck, and our brig hauled out of the line; but the enemy being now too closely engaged to take possession of us, our flag was again hoisted, while the red-cross of England descended, in succession, on board of every vessel in the enemy's squadron, except two small ones who attempted to escape, but were chased and brought back by two of our small craft. “Thus, by the unparalleled skill and bravery of Perry, (whom every officer and seaman acknowledges to be the saviour, under Heaven, of the American squadron) we find ourselves in possession of the ship Detroit, of twenty guns, large twenty-four pounders; ship Queen Charlotte, of nineteen guns; brig Hunter, of ten guns; schooner Lady Prevost, of twelve guns; schooner Chippeway, of one gun; and the sloop Little Belt, of two guns. So that the American squadron is increased by the addition of six vessels and sixty-four guns, while the enemy have not a single gun afloat on this lake. “The engagement lasted about three hours, and never was victory more decisive and complete. The captured squadron, you perceive, exceeds ours in number of guns as well as weight of metal; their crews were more numerous, and more prisoners were taken than we had men to guard them. The loss on both sides is severe; scarcely a man on board this brig has escaped unhurt. I have, myself, however, fortunately come off with a mere scratch in the breast, where a splinter struck me. On board the Lawrence there were twenty-two killed and sixty-one wounded, although thirty-one of our crew were on the sick list, and unfit for duty. Our total loss throughout the squadron is twenty-seven killed, and ninety-six wounded—a pretty strong evidence that our brig bore the brunt of the action. The day before the action, there were one hundred and sixteen men in the squadron reported unfit for duty. “I am unable to state the loss of the enemy; it must, however, have been immense, as several of their vessels are literally cut to pieces; so much so, that the masts of the two ships were all carried away by the board, in a slight gale after the battle, owing to their being so severely wounded in the action. Barclay, the British commodore, has done himself great honor by the gallant manner in which he fought his squadron. Twice was he carried below on account of his wounds, and as often returned again upon deck. Little did I think, when compelled to fight under this same brave officer, in the battle of Trafalgar, that I should ever fight against him. But so it is— “There is a divinity that shapes our ends, “Rough-hew them how we will.” I was also in an engagement with him afterwards, with a French ship, when he lost his arm. He is a fine-looking officer, about thirty-six years old, and has seen much service. A shot from our ship deprived him of his remaining hand. The first care of our humane commodore, after the battle, was to attend to the comfort of the suffering crews of both squadrons. The sick and wounded are taken care of in the most tender manner, and the officers who have fallen on both sides, were buried last Sunday morning with the honors of war, on an island in the lake. “The prisoners have been landed at Sandusky, and Perry has requested Harrison to have them marched to Chilicothe, until the pleasure of government respecting them is known. Perry is now on board the Ariel, and Yarnell has been directed to take the Lawrence to Erie, with all the wounded of our fleet, as this ship is so cut up, that it will not be safe to keep her on the lake until repaired. “By this time I suppose you are anxious to see the names of those who have distinguished themselves on this occasion. Well, then, attend.— Next to the god-like Perry, (whose exalted merits are far above the reach of any commendation my humble pen can bestow) stands the gallant Elliott, and the greatest praise that can be bestowed on either of these heroes, is to say, that each of them was himself—he that is more, is more than man.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LVI. THE FORAGING PARTY. O Woman! Woman! Woman! All the Gods Have not such power of doing good to man, As you of doing harm! Dryden's All for Love. Among the few noble spirits to whom our hero had become strongly attached during his service on the peninsula, was an officer named Cummins, who had several times rendered himself conspicuous for his heroism and military skill,[26] [26] Particularly on the 17th of July and 17th of August, 1819. and who was at once admired for his bravery, respected for his talents, and beloved for his virtues. His morals were exemplary, his deportment dignified, and his address insinuating. Although lieutenant Willoughby was a general favorite in the army, yet he had but few friends—and Cummins was one of the chosen few. Affairs between pickets, of greater or lesser magnitude, were daily occurring, and foreging could only be accomplished within the limits of the enemy's line, and at the hazard of continual contests; for the force which invested Fort George, was at this time greatly superior to that of its defenders. In one of these foraging excursions, our hero and his friend Cummins, being closely engaged in an interesting conversation, imperceptibly drew off from their party into the woods, and suddenly found themselves near a farm-house, before they were fully aware of their aberration. No enemy was in view, and as our adventurers were well armed, they were determined to dismount, and, if possible, obtain some refreshment in the cottage. Having fastened their horses to a tree, and carefully reconnoitred the passes which led from the house, they advanced to the door, and knocked for admittance; but no one appearing to answer the summons, they lifted the latch, and entered the rustic mansion sans ceremonie. They now found themselves in a narrow hall, at the farther extremity of which was a flight of stairs to the garret, and on either hand a door opening into a ground apartment. They entered first one and then the other of these doors, without discovering a human being; but as they were about leaving the second, a low murmur of voices saluted their ears from a room beyond; and what they had at first taken for a curtained window, they now conjectured to be a sash-door leading to the apartment which contained the speakers. “Be on your guard,” whispered Cummins, as they softly approached the door; “there may be too many for us.” George made no reply, but advanced to the door, and applied his ear to the key-hole to listen. Several different voices could be distinguished, but in so low a key, that the subject of their conversation could not be gathered. He thought, however, that the tone of one, (who mentioned the words Niagara, De Rottenberg,[27] [27] A general officer in the British army which invested Fort George. Kingston and some others, loud enough to be understood by the listener) were familiar to his ear. While George was thus engaged, his friend gently removed one corner of the curtain, and obtained a distinct view of the room and the party within it. He immediately touched our hero on the arm, and drew him gently from the door. “There is treason hatching,” whispered Cummins. “A dozen British officers are tampering with a deserter.” “British officers!” “Yes—in disguise; but the laced collar of one of them is visible above his cloak, and I presume that they are all of a kidney. Our cue is, to retreat. “How know you that they have a deserter with them?” asked George, in a whisper, as they cautiously proceeded towards the hall. “I saw him,” returned Cummins, “and knew him instantly. It is your truant servant boy, whose sudden and extraordinary disappearance has excited so much surprise.” “Who!” “Reuben.” “Impossible!” replied George. “I must have a peep, if it costs my life.” “It is rashness to venture,” whispered Cummins. “Let us retreat while it is in our power. I feel no disposition, just at this time, to be introduced to the magnanimous gentlemen within.” George was alike deaf to the advice of his friend, and to the suggestions of prudence. His curiosity was inflamed, and had there been no other way of gratifying it, he would have pounced into the room and trusted to fortune for the rest. Fortunately, however, he gained a rapid survey of the groupe, without being detected. A youth was standing with his back towards the door, holding a folded paper in his hand, and earnestly addressing several gentlemen, whose persons 44* were enveloped in cloaks or great coats. The manner of the speaker was earnest and his gestures animated, while he gracefully turned to the right and left as if appealing to his auditors for the correctness of his sentiments. Suddenly he ceased, and after delivering the folded paper, so changed his position as to afford our hero a full view of his face. It was Sophia, in the character of Reuben. George continued in this perilous situation so long, that Cummins became seriously alarmed, and returned to urge his departure. Completely absorbed in wonder, he suffered himself to be led to the hall in silence. The moment they entered it, a hard featured middle-aged man was descending the stairs, and he started with unaffected surprise on thus unexpectedly encountering the livery of his enemy. After a moment's hesitation, he edged towards the door from which our adventurers had just issued, who suspecting his intention was to betray them, darted before him, and presenting their pistols at his breast, assured him that an audible breath should be his last. The sturdy Englishman was not, however, to be thus intimidated; he dashed the pistols from him, right and left—broke through his opponents with the strength of a giant, and flew towards the interior apartment, calling loudly for assistance. The alarm being given, no time was to be lost. Our adventurers were on horseback in a moment; and, after discharging their pistols in the faces of the enemy, set off on a full gallop through the woods, and soon rejoined their comrades in a field beyond. The waggons were now loaded with forage, and the party returned to camp unmolested. But, the mysterious Reuben—what could be the object of his interview with British officers, and what could that folded paper contain? Was there a treasonable plot on foot?—Could Sandford be concerned in it?—How was the circumstance to be reconciled with the well-known vigilance of the American pickets? What was the extent of the plot?—How many might be concerned in it?—How could it be circumvented? These, and a thousand other similar questions, passed in rapid succession through the mind of our hero, as he accompanied the party to camp; but he could form no satisfactory conclusion on the subject. For several days he thought of nothing else, and the subject might have occupied his mind for months, had not the busy arrangements which were now making for an important enterprise, diverted his attention to other objects. The health of Wilkinson being now partially restored, the most active preparations were on foot for the execution of his projected expedition against Montreal. Grenadier Island, a point between Sacket's Harbor and Kingston, had been determined upon as the most eligible place for a rendezvous, to collect and concentrate the different regiments, previous to embarking them in the batteaux which were to convey them down the St. Lawrence. For this place, therefore, the general embarked on the second day of October, with the main body of the northern army; leaving a small garrison of regulars and militia to occupy Fort George and its dependencies, under the command of Scott, who had directions to march them to Sacket's Harbor, and there unite with the grand expedition, as soon as general M`Clure should arrive with his volunteers to relieve him on the peninsula. In the mean time, the British army under De Rottenberg retained its position, about four miles from Fort George, and Scott had every reason to apprehend an attack, as soon as the departure of Wilkinson was known to the enemy. He therefore made the greatest exertions to strengthen his defences, which were very incomplete at the time he was left in command. Instead of attacking him, however, the enemy suddenly broke up their encampment, burnt and destroyed all their camp equipage and many stand of arms, in order to facilitate their movements towards Kingston, which was suspected to be the first object of Wilkinson's expedition. Scott's position was now perfectly safe, and his duties consequently extremely light; but indolent safety and inglorious ease, were not the objects of his ambition. He was impatient to be relieved at this post, that he might fly after Wilkinson and share the dangers and glory which awaited the American arms on the St. Lawrence. In a few days his wishes were gratified. The volunteers which had been raised by the patriotic M`Clure, Porter, and Chapin, arrived at the garrison; and, agreeably to his instructions, Scott resigned his command to the former of these heroes, and pressed forward with his brave followers by forced marches, towards Sacket's Harbor. In the army which Wilkinson was concentrating for this expedition, the gallant Brown, (now a brigadier in the regular service) held an important command—as did, also, the intrepid Boyd; the former being appointed to lead the van, and the latter to command the rear guard. The ever-daring Scott, the heroic Covington, and the brave Swartwout, were to command their respective brigades. Colonels Brearly, Porter, M`Comb, and Preston, had proved themselves heroes on the Niagara, and were now ready to confirm their claim to the title on the St. Lawrence. Pearce, who, after the fall of Pike, at Little York, led on the Americans to victory and glory, was now impatiently waiting to be led by Wilkinson through the same perilous path to the same glittering goal. Forsyth was early at the rendezvous, with his valiant corps of riflemen, who were eager, once more, to exercise their well-tried arms against the enemy—those arms which had been so successfully wielded at Gananoque, Ogdensburg, Elizabethtown, Little York, and Fort George. Cummins, Willoughby, Smith, Whiting, Worth, and many other officers of distinguished merit, whose names shall be recorded in another chapter, were also engaged in this expedition. The whole army consisted of about eight thousand men, and was to move under the immediate direction of Wilkinson, assisted by major-general Lewis. On the twenty-fifth day of October, the troops at Grenadier Island began to embark in boats prepared for the purpose; and although the autumnal storms were now raging with great violence on the lake, their gallant leader determined to delay the enterprise no longer. Disease and pain still hung about him, but the energy of his mind rose superior to bodily infirmity, and he superintended the embarkation most of the time, exposed to the cold searching winds and drenching rains. As the boats were filled, he bade them take advantage of the first momentary pause in the storm to slide into the St. Lawrence, and gain the next appointed rendezvous, which was a place called French Creek. On the day before the embarkation was completed, colonel Randolph arrived at Grenadier Island with two hundred and thirty men. As Scott had not yet reached Sacket's Harbor with his column, orders were left for him to proceed on by land through Brownsville[28] [28] This village was first settled by the enterprise and exertions of general Brown, from whom it takes its name. See vol. i, page 39. and Oxbow, to Ogdensburg, and there join the army as it passed down the St. Lawrence. The van, under Brown, had already entered that majestic river, and the commander in chief was hastening the departure of the remaining brigades, whom he intended to follow in his gig, accompanied by his passage boat with his staff. By the arrival of Randolph, our hero was furnished with a letter from O'Hara, which the reader will find recorded in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LVII. MICHIGAN RESTORED. O'ershadowing laurels deck The living hero's brows; But lovelier wreaths entwine his neck, His children and his spouse! Exulting o'er his lot, The dangers he has braved; He clasps the dear ones, hails the cot, Which his own valor saved. Montgomery. “Erie, Pa. October 20, 1813. “Good news, my dear Willoughby! Detroit, Sandwich, Malden—all that Hull and you lost, and all that you might have taken—is now in possession of the Americans. Tecumseh is slain, Proctor fled, and the British army captured, with all their camp equipage and their leader's private baggage. Harrison is the hero who has achieved all this, by the valor of the brave troops under his command. I have just conversed with an officer who served as a volunteer in this brilliant affair, and he has furnished me with the following particulars: “As soon as Harrison was informed of our victory on the lake, he concentrated his whole army at the mouth of Portage river, near Sandusky Bay, at which place he was joined, on Friday, the seventeenth of September, by the venerable governor of Kentucky (his excellency Isaac Shelby) with four thousand well mounted volunteers. This grey-headed veteran, now upwards of sixty-years old, volunteered to serve under Harrison during his intended expedition to Malden. Harrison gratefully accepted the patriotic proposal, and requested him to retain the command of his own volunteers which should constitute the right wing of the invading army. The works at Fort Meigs being now reduced (as mentioned in my letter dated the eighteenth of August) general M`Arthur marched from that post with his brigade, and joined the main body also. “On Tuesday, the twenty-first ultimo, the army began to embark on board the squadron, and in the course of the week were all transported to a cluster of islands within twelve miles of Malden; where, on the Monday following, they were again received by the American flotilla, consisting of sixteen vessels of war and upwards of one hundred boats. In the afternoon of the same day the troops were all landed in good order, on the enemy's shore, three miles below Malden. Colonel R. M. Johnson, (who had signalized himself during the siege of Fort Meigs) had been previously ordered to proceed with his regiment to Detroit by land, where he arrived on Wednesday, the twenty-ninth. “As soon as general Proctor was informed of the approach of the American army, an event which he expected after the battle on the lake, he prepared to abandon Malden—and accordingly, set fire to the fort, destroyed all the public property, and retreated with his army along the banks of the Thames, towards the interior of Upper Canada, accompanied by Tecumseh, with his red forces. The ruins of the fort, barracks, and other public buildings, were still smoking when the American army entered Malden, and a number of females came out to meet the general as he approached the town, and implored his protection. It was not Cockburn to whom they thus appealed. The violated females of Hampton passed in rapid review through the hero's mind, and he exclaimed—“Yes, fair suppliants, I will protect you with my life; instant death shall be his fate who presumes to treat one of you with disrespect. I have come to conquer—not to oppress; to disarm assassins—not to assail the peaceful. You may rely upon our protection.” Thus having secured the hearts of the ladies, the men were easily prevailed upon to receive their new masters. The inhabitants received every indulgence that could be granted or wished. “The next day the Americans proceeded to Sandwich, crossed the river, and entered Detroit, which had been left by the British in possession of the Indians, who now fled with the greatest precipitation. Here they were received by the distressed inhabitants with the most rapturous acclamations of joy, and Harrison was hailed by them as the angel of their deliverance. They had been subjected to the caprice of tyrants of the worst kind; their property had been at the disposal of the British and Indians, and a word, or even a look, would sometimes forfeit it. The bare mention of a rumor unfavorable to the British cause, or the slightest interference in favor of their unfortunate countrymen in captivity, subjected them to imprisonment in the guard-house or the dungeon—to banishment from their homes, or to severities of even a worse nature. No wonder, then, that when the American troops landed, they hailed them as their deliverers. “M`Arthur's brigade first crossed the river, and there were, at that time, about six hundred Indians encamped at the back of the town, employed in cooking victuals and jerking beef, all of 45 which they left in their haste to escape, and thus the Americans were furnished with a supply of provisions that lasted several days. “Colonel Johnson having now arrived with his regiment, Harrison determined to pursue the retreating enemy up the river Thames; notwithstanding he was then four days' march in advance. He accordingly directed M`Arthur to occupy Detroit with his brigade, and on Saturday, the second of October, commenced the pursuit, and marched thirty miles before he halted. The patriotic Shelby led on his own brave mounted volunteers; and the gallant Desha headed a brigade of infantry. Colonel Ball and major Wood, who had both been promoted for their bravery in the defence of Fort Meigs, were also engaged in the present pursuit. Supported by such men, could Harrison do less than conquer? But these were not all. Perry, the hero of Erie, volunteered his services as aid to the commander in chief, and so did general Cass, who was once a colonel in Hull's army. John Speed Smith and John Chambers, esquires, also volunteered their services for the same purpose. Captain Todd and lieutenant O'Fallon were the general's regular aids-de-camp. “On Tuesday, the fifth, after some successful skirmishes with the savages, who opposed their advance, the eager Americans overtook their retreating enemy, whose progress had been retarded by the baggage of their chief, who was so over-loaded with plunder that his carriage proceeded very heavily along. Finding himself reduced to the alternative of yielding or fighting, Proctor chose the latter, as thereby he might possibly preserve his pilfered booty, or at least save his own dear person from captivity. For after his treatment of the Americans in his power, he felt that he had no right to expect mercy from them, should the scale be turned against him. “He was now about four miles ahead of Harrison, and had made a stand, in a very advantageous position, on an open field, approachable only by a narrow plain between the river and a swamp. Notwithstanding the fatigue which his army had endured in forced marches, Harrison determined to make an immediate attack. Knowing that the American back-woods-men ride better in the woods than any other people—that a rifle or musket is no impediment to them, and that they can fire as accurately on horseback as on foot, he determined to assail the enemy in a manner entirely new, and, of course, to them entirely unexpected. Having, therefore, arranged the mounted infantry in suitable columns for making a galloping charge, he ordered them to advance, receive the enemy's fire, and then break his line, while the foot were to follow, and support them in the conflict. “As they emerged from the wood, in front of the British line, a general discharge of musketry assailed them, which caused many of the horses to recoil, and a temporary disorder was produced. Another fire was received, and the noble animals gained confidence, were soon put in motion, and in a few moments the British line was pierced by upwards of one thousand horsemen, armed with muskets, who dashed through with irresistible speed, striking down or trampling under foot all opponents; and having killed and wounded upwards of fifty in the charge, instantly formed in the rear, wheeled to the right about, and renewed the attack. Such a panic did this novel mode of modern warfare strike into the astonished Englishmen, that all resistance was abandoned, and four hundred and seventy-two soldiers threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war, together with three colonels and two majors. “Proctor instantly perceived that the day was lost; and (trembling for the fate which his barbarities merited) thought only of effecting his own escape and the preservation of his private baggage. He therefore left his followers to their fate, and fled in his carriage, under a strong escort of dragoons. “Not so Tecumseh, who headed about twelve hundred Indians on the left. His line had been assailed in a similar mode, by two columns under colonel Johnson, and still remained unbroken. He disdained to fly or yield like his trembling allies, and having posted his warriors in the best possible positions to repulse an attack, firmly maintained his ground. Johnson then ordered his columns to dismount, and charge on foot, when a most desperate and sanguinary conflict took place; Tecumsch's line was broken, and his undaunted band were charged front and rear. The Indians, however, were not dismayed, but quickly collecting their principal strength upon the right, they made an attempt to penetrate the line of infantry under the gallant Desha. At that moment the venerable Shelby pressed forward with a regiment to the support of his friend, and the Indians were compelled to fall back. “Meanwhile, Johnson was in the hottest of the fight, and his blood was gushing from him in five different streams, dying with a crimson hue the milk-white charger on which he was mounted. Covered with blood, and faint with pain and fatigue, he now encountered the redoubtable Teeumseh, arm to arm. “Then came the tug of war.” “The moment the savages beheld their chief thus engaged, a shower of bullets was poured upon his assailant, piercing his coat, hat, and accoutrements, without, however, injuring his person. Tecumseh levelled his rifle and fired—his aim was unerring, but as he pulled the trigger his opponent's horse plunged, and the ball whistled harmless by him. The desperate warrior now sprang forward with his tomahawk—his eye flashed fire, and he seemed to increase in stature, as he raised his arm, to throw the deadly weapon, collecting all his energy into one dreadful effort. At that moment his brave opponent's horse received a wound, and staggered back, while his rider drew a pistol and shot Tecumseh through the head. The victor fainted in the act, and both fell together, mingling their streaming blood on the ground. “But the wounds of the victorious colonel were not mortal; he was speedily removed from the scene of slaughter, while major Thompson assumed the command of his column, and the battle continued to rage for nearly an hour, when the savages were put to flight, and the Americans remained masters of the field. Harrison, who had been in every part of the action, now gave orders for the wounded of both armies to receive every humane attention that situation and circumstances would permit. 45* “When Proctor fled from the field of battle, he was closely pursued by a squadron of horse; but his superior knowledge of the country, and the speed of his horses, enabled him to effect his escape. His baggage, however, which was very valuable, and all his private papers, fell into the hands of his pursuers, and were brought to Harrison, after the battle. “Among the trophies of this brilliant victory, were six pieces of brass artillery, three of which were the same pieces which Dearborn assisted in taking from Burgoyne, at Saratoga, during the revolutionary war, and which were surrendered by Hull at Detroit, at the commencement of the present. Harrison has also taken two iron twenty-four pounders, and upwards of five thousand stand of small arms. The enemy had no standard in the field, or it would also have been taken. “Many officers distinguished themselves in this battle. Colonel R. M. Johnson, I have already mentioned. Cass and Perry were at every point where they could be useful. Shelby exhibited all the vigor of youth, the same ardent zeal which distinguished him in the revolutionary war, and the same undaunted bravery which he manifested at King's Mountain. Though the governor of an independent state, yet for the good of his country, he voluntarily placed himself under the command of an officer far his junior in years, and was not more remarkable for his courage, zeal, and activity, than for the promptitude and cheerfulness with which he obeyed his general's orders. Major-generals Desha and Henry, and brigadiers Allen, Caldwell, King, Chiles, and Trotter, all of the Kentucky volunteers, covered themselves with laurels. General Adaip and lieutenant-colonel James Johnson, rendered themselves conspicuous by their bravery and skill; as did, also, colonels M`Dowell, and Walker, of Shelby's staff. Major Wood and previously distinguished himself at Fort Meigs, and on this occasion he added new laurels to his brow. Majors Barry, Crittenden, Payne, and Thompson, were both zealous and active in the discharge of every hazardous duty assigned them; while captain Butler, captain Todd, and lieutenant O'Fallon were equally emulous in the discharge of theirs. Harrison has expressed his warmest approbation of the conduct of Smith and Chambers, the two gentlemen who volunteered as his aids. In short, sir, every man did his duty, and every man is entitled to a share of the glory which was on that day so brilliantly shed on the American arms. The fifth of October should hereafter be kept by Americans as a festival. “When my informant left Malden, Harrison was about to embark for Buffalo, with all his disposable force, and you may expect him at Fort George by the first of November. Adieu. “WILLIAM O'HARA.” The pleasure which our hero derived from the contents of the foregoing letter, was not in the least diminished by the perusal of another, handed him also by colonel Randolph. This last was from the secretary of war, (then at Sacket's Harbor) and enclosed a captain's commission, to which rank lieutenant Willoughby had been previously brevetted, for his good conduct and conspicuous gallantry on the twenty-fourth of August, when the encampment at Fort George was attacked by the whole British army.</field>

Though the governor of an independent state, yet for the good of his country, he voluntarily placed himself under the command of an officer far his junior in years, and was not more remarkable for his courage, zeal, and activity, than for the promptitude and cheerfulness with which he obeyed his general's orders. Major-generals Desha and Henry, and brigadiers Allen, Caldwell, King, Chiles, and Trotter, all of the Kentucky volunteers, covered themselves with laurels. General Adaip and lieutenant-colonel James Johnson, rendered themselves conspicuous by their bravery and skill; as did, also, colonels M`Dowell, and Walker, of Shelby's staff. Major Wood and previously distinguished himself at Fort Meigs, and on this occasion he added new laurels to his brow. Majors Barry, Crittenden, Payne, and Thompson, were both zealous and active in the discharge of every hazardous duty assigned them; while captain Butler, captain Todd, and lieutenant O'Fallon were equally emulous in the discharge of theirs. Harrison has expressed his warmest approbation of the conduct of Smith and Chambers, the two gentlemen who volunteered as his aids. In short, sir, every man did his duty, and every man is entitled to a share of the glory which was on that day so brilliantly shed on the American arms. The fifth of October should hereafter be kept by Americans as a festival. “When my informant left Malden, Harrison was about to embark for Buffalo, with all his disposable force, and you may expect him at Fort George by the first of November.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LVIII. THE GRAND EXPEDITION. Once more they glitter in refulgent arms, Once more the fields are filled with dire alarms. Pope's Homer. When De Rottenberg withdrew so suddenly from the peninsula, he led his army by forced marches to Kingston, under the impression that Wilkinson's movements were directed against that place. To keep this impression alive, and thereby confine the enemy's operations to the protection of that place only, Wilkinson chose French Creek for his next rendezvous, as being directly opposite the point at which the British might reasonably suppose he would land. The van of the army, under Brown, had already reached this rendezvous, after a very boisterous passage from Grenadier Island, during which many of the boats were driven on shore, and much provisions and clothing lost. The vigilant enemy had observed this movement, and determined, while the army was thus divided, to attack the van. They accordingly approached French Creek, on Monday, the first day of November, with a squadron of two brigs, two schooners, and a number of boats loaded with infantry; and, about sunset, commenced a furious attack on Brown's detachment. Such, however, was the judicious arrangement and heroic conduct of that leader, assisted by the artillery of M'Pherson and Fanning, that the assailants were compelled to retire; and, on renewing the attack the next morning, were completely repulsed. In a few hours afterwards Chauncey's squadron entered the St. Lawrence, and took a position to command the north and south channels, so that during the following day, the rear of the army reached the general rendezvous in safety. But the commander in chief was now so severely indisposed, that he was obliged to be carried on shore, and lodged in a tent; while the further advance of the army was suspended for four-and-twenty hours, in order to effect the necessary arrangements. On Friday morning they again moved forward. The storm had subsided, the river was placid, the day delightful, and the health of the general improved. More than three hundred boats, crowded with troops, and arranged in martial order, moved gracefully down the stream, propelled along by the current and a gentle breeze. They proceeded unmolested, although their motions were closely watched by the enemy during the whole day. The sun was setting as the rear of the flotilla passed Elizabethtown, an English village in the county of Leeds, on the left bank of the river. Our hero's attention was directed to the spot by Cummins. “We are now,” observed the latter, “opposite the scene of Forsyth's successful gallantry; the field where he plucked the first sprig of those laurels with which he has since so profusely decked his brows.” “You allude to his affair at Gananoque?”[29] [29] See note to page 44 of this volume. “Not to that alone,” replied Cummins. “About four months after that affair, he honored Elizabethtown with a similar visit, (which is situated in the same county.)—It was on the sixth of February last, previous to his promotion, while he was commandant at Ogdensburg—Brown being in winter-quarters with his family. He left Ogdensburgh with about two hundred volunteers, part from his own company, part from captain Lydle's volunteers, and the remainder citizens, among whom was colonel Benedict, besides several other gentlemen of distinction. The detachment proceeded in sleighs up the river to Morristown, here on our right, where they formed, and at three o'clock in the morning crossed over to Elizabethtown, surprised the guard, took fifty-two prisoners, among whom were major Carley, three captains and two lieutenants; also one hundred and twenty muskets, twenty rifles, two casks fixed ammunition, &amp;c. but no private property was either taken or destroyed. All was effected without the loss of a single man.” “I now recollect the circumstance,” answered George. “He was led to the measure in retaliation of the repeated aggressions of the British, who had been in the habit of crossing the river and taking deserters, sixteen of whom they had confined in the jail at Elizabethtown, whom they threatened to shoot. Forsyth succeeded in liberating them.” “And that part of his success I lament,” rejoined Cummins. “Why so?” “Because, so long as wars are necessary, the crimes of desertion and treachery must be capitally punished; and did belligerents refuse countenance to such crimes in their enemies, they would soon cease to exist.” “I have long been of the same opinion,” replied Willoughby; “and have frequently wished that it were established as a law of nations, to profit by the treachery, but to hang the traitor. The remedy may seem to be the greater evil; but, be assured, it would soon work its own cure.” “There can be no doubt of it,” answered Cummins; “and had this been the case, you would, before this time, have heard that your boy Reuben had danced in the air.” Our hero was visibly embarrassed; but, after a moment's hesitation replied—“No, sir; had such been the law of nations, Reuben had never deserted; for then it would have been to seek certain destruction.” “And De Rottenberg would still have remained idle on the peninsula, instead of hanging here on our rear.” “Perhaps not idle,” returned George. “If your conjectures are correct, and he really learned our destination from Reuben, that lad's treachery may have been instrumental in saving Fort George; for De Rottenberg would certainly have attacked Scott after our departure, had not his attention been drawn another way. But, understand me—whatever good may result from intended evil, it does not in the least tend to palliate the crime of the perpetrator.” “Whatever good may have been produced on the peninsula,” observed Cummins, “it is, I think, pretty evident, that it will not extend to the St. Lawrence; and I shall not be surprised if we meet both De Rottenberg and Prevost at Montreal.” “Then let us meet them,” answered George. “But recollect, my friend, that we are first to meet Hampton, with all his army; and it will go hard, indeed, if our united forces are not a match for theirs.” “Where is this junction to take place?” asked Cummins. “That is more than we subordinates can pretend to know. But, being by birth a yankee, I have a right to guess.” “Well, as you guess.” “At the mouth of the Chataugay river, which empties into the St. Lawrence not many miles this side of Montreal: for so Hampton's recent movements certainly indicate.” “His troops I understand are generally raw and undisciplined,” observed Cummins. “Yes—but they are commanded by officers of tried and approved courage and talents. Besides Izard, he has colonel Clark, who, for partizan warfare, is another Forsyth. Then there is Snelling, whose metal was tried on the banks of the Wabash, and at Maguaga; Wool, who distinguished himself at Queenston; King, the hero of Black Rock, who was also conspicuous for his bravery at Little York; Purdy, Parker, Finch, Hamilton, Nash, and many others whom I cannot at present recollect.” During this conversation, the shades of evening had fell upon the surrounding landscapes; the moon (now nearly at her full) slowly ascended, like a silver target, in their front; and the cold breath of expiring autumn sighed sadly as it passed. The American village of Morrisville had just faded from their view in the rear, when the preconcerted signal-gun was heard from the van, and the flotilla approached the American shore, where the troops landed and encamped for the night. On the following morning, the commander in chief had so far surmounted his malady, as to advance down the river in his gig, to reconnoitre; and, on his return, ordered every man to be landed, (except a sufficient number to navigate the boats) and on the approach of evening to commence their march by land, in order that they might pass the batteries at Prescott under cover of the night. The flotilla were to proceed at the same time, under the superintendance of Brown, who was the general officer of the day, with orders to receive the troops at an appointed rendezvous two miles below Prescott. The commander in chief now wrote an order to general Hampton to form a junction with the army, at St. Regis or its vicinity. This order was to have been dispatched the next day by express, but as it was preparing, colonel King, (Hampton's adjutant-general) fortunately arrived at the rendezvous, and immediately departed with the same. At about eight o'clock in the evening, the river was enveloped in so heavy a fog, that it was thought the flotilla might pass the enemy's batteries unperceived; and accordingly orders were given for the troops to march and the flotilla to advance at the same moment. But before they reached Prescott, the wind freshened, the fog dispersed, the moon broke forth, and they were in full view of the enemy. The general, in his gig, proceeded ahead, followed by his passage boat and staff, and succeeded in order by the whole flotilla. 46 No sooner were they espied by their vigilant enemy, than a heavy fire was opened upon them from the batteries, and a great number of shot and shells were thrown at the marching column, who were discovered by their gleaming arms, which reflected the moon-beams. But not a single shot took effect, nor did the Americans sustain the slightest injury. The batteries were passed by the whole flotilla, except two schooners, loaded with provisions, which sought for safety in the river near Ogdensburgh, but were extricated the next day. By ten o'clock, on Sunday morning, every one had safely arrived at the appointed rendezvous. In the mean time, Scott was on his way from Fort George to join the expedition; and after a forced march of nineteen days, through rain and mud, (during the whole of which time the sun was not visible for twelve hours) he learned, to his great mortification, upon his arrival in the neighborhood of Sacket's Harbor, that the expedition had already taken its departure. He therefore left his column, and by a forced effort of two days and one night, came up with the army and joined it the day before it passed Prescott and Ogdensburgh. He was immediately assigned to the command of a handsome battalion in the van, under colonel M`Comb. For the four succeeding days, as the army continued to descend the river, its rear was almost incessantly harrassed by the artillery and gunboats of the enemy, who had followed it from Kingston to Prescott, and from Prescott still continued the pursuit. Several times was it found necessary to halt, land, and chastise this insolence; till at length, on Thursday, the eleventh day of the month, this skirmishing changed to the form of a regular and well-fought battle, between the gallant Boyd's division, of thirteen hundred men, and a detachment of the British army, of two thousand five hundred men, under lieutenant-colonel Morrison, aided by nine gunboats, and seven pieces of artillery. The main body of the American army, with all their gunboats, were far in advance of the field of action, which was on Chrystler's farm, in Williamsburg, on the Canadian shore. Wilkinson and Lewis were both too much indisposed, during this affair, to leave their cabins, and therefore the command devolved on Boyd alone, who advanced upon the enemy in a most gallant manner, with his detachment formed in three columns. The brave Ripley was sent forward to bring the enemy to action; and with his undaunted regiment, he twice charged the enemy's advance, consisting of two regiments united, (either of them more than equal to his own) and succeeded in driving them over the ravines and fences which intersected the field of battle, now celebrated by the name of Chrystler's field. Meanwhile, Covington, at the head of his brigade, had advanced upon the enemy's right in a style of such conspicuous gallantry, that he attracted the attention of a party of sharp shooters stationed in Chrystler's house, one of whom too fatally levelled his piece and shot the brave leader from his horse. “Commission'd with the hero's doom, “Lightning wing'd a cruel ball— “'Twas the herald of the tomb, “Covington obey'd the call.” For some time after losing their valiant leader, this brigade continued to advance in the most determined manner, until the fire of the enemy's artillery at length succeeded in breaking and dispersing them. The battle, however, continued with obstinate resolution on both sides for more than two hours, when the grand object of the Americans was obtained, which was to embark and proceed down the river unmolested. The enemy felt too sore to pursue them. Many officers distinguished themselves on this occasion, both previous and subsequent to the fall of the immortal Covington. Preston was severely wounded, while nobly fighting at the head of his regiment. The brave Cummins met with a similar fate, while leading to a charge, and undiscouraged by the wound, continued to advance until loss of blood obliged him to retire. His friend Willoughby, who had volunteered his services as aid to Boyd, received a wound in the foot as he was bearing his commander's orders across the field. General Swartwout; colonel Preston; majors Chambers and Noon; captains Foster, Townsend, Myers, Campbell, and Murdock; lieutenants Heaton, Williams, Lynch, Brown and Crary, will all carry to their graves honorable marks of their bravery on this occasion—many of their wounds were very severe. Lieutenants Smith, Hunter, and Olmstead, fell gloriously on the field, martyrs to the cause in which they were engaged. Colonels Coles, Pearce, Gaines, Ripley, Swift, Upham, Walback, Johnson, and Aspinwall; majors Woodford, Malcom, Morgan, Grafton, Gardner, and Bebee; captain Irvin; lieutenants Whiting and Worth, and many of the platoon officers, acquitted themselves with great honor on this occasion. The total loss of the Americans was one hundred and two killed, and two hundred and thirty-seven wounded. Early on Friday morning the American army proceeded on its route, and, in the course of the forenoon, reached Barnhart, near Cornwall, where Wilkinson received a letter from Hampton, informing him that many unfortunate circumstances would prevent his meeting him at St. Regis, and that the only way in which he could effectually co-operate with Wilkinson, would be to meet him before Montreal, for which place Hampton would immediately march by the way of Plattsburgh. On receipt of this letter, Wilkinson consulted his principal officers on the question of proceeding, who determined that the expedition should be immediately abandoned and the army quit the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence, and go into winter-quarters at French Mills, on Salmon river, which it accordingly did on the thirteenth of November, and thus closed the second campaign of the northern army. The village of French Mills is situated at the head of navigation of Salmon creek, in the township of Constable, county of Franklin, state of New-York, about two hundred and thirty miles from Albany. Hampton's army went into winter quarters about the same time, and the command was resigned to general Izard.</field>

While the lingering moon delay'd, In the wilderness of night, Ere the morn awoke the shade Into loveliness and light— Britain's tigers, wild for blood, Darted on our sleeping fold, Down the mountains, o'er the flood, Dark as thunder-clouds they roll'd. Montgomery—altered. While the northern army was descending the St. Lawrence, the militia and volunteers under M`Clure were engaged in frequent skirmishes on the peninsula; and as soon as the expedition against Montreal was known to be abandoned, a British force of fifteen hundred regulars, and above seven hundred Indians, proceeded towards Fort George with the determination of entirely expelling the Americans from the Canadian shore of the Niagara. The situation of M`Clure was now extremely unpropitious; the militia were daily deserting him, the enemy rapidly advancing, and all was confusion and dismay. Such was the posture of affairs when the brave Fraser (the distinguished aid-de-camp of Pike) arrived at the encampment and offered his services to M`Clure in any capacity. The general immediately made him his aid, and gave him a command of Indians, who were much attached to him, having been in several skirmishes with him during the command of Boyd on the peninsula. Of this Indian corps, young Logan was second in command. The remainder of the militia having now completed the term of service for which they had engaged, re-crossed the river, and returned to their homes, with the exception of about one hundred and fifty, among whom were a double portion of officers. Those who did remain, could be relied on, but they were too few to contend, with any probability of success, against the advancing enemy. A council of war was therefore called, on the tenth of December, in which it was proposed to burn Newark, and abandon the British side of the Niagara; and to this proposition a majority acceded. But the enemy were advancing in great force, and were now within twelve miles of the fort. To burn the village at this time would hasten their approach, and the artillery and baggage would probably fall into their hands. What was then to be done? Fraser proposed to send a flag of truce, on some pretence, to the enemy, and thus gain time until the sick, the baggage, and the artillery, could be conveyed across the river, and then set fire to the village. This proposition was instantly adopted, and Fraser immediately departed with the flag, to meet the advancing foe, accompanied by a major Bennet, who went in the capacity of his servant, for the purpose of ascertaining, if possible, the force of the enemy. Owing to some misunderstanding, the village was fired sooner than the hour previously agreed upon, so that Fraser and Bennet narrowly escaped captivity, or even a worse fate; for they had left the enemy's camp scarcely three minutes, when the blaze of Newark burst in full splendor upon the view of the British army, and highly exasperated their leader, who instantly ordered out the dragoons in chase of the flag-bearer and his companion. But the same cause which alarmed the enemy, had, at the same instant, admonished Fraser and Bennet of their danger; and they consequently succeeded in outrunning the pursuing troop. Several of the best mounted were, however, evidently gaining on the fugitives, when they crossed a small bridge within three miles of the scene of conflagration. The planks of which this bridge was composed were laid loose upon cross beams, and of this circumstance they determined to take an advantage. The resolution was formed and executed in a moment. One of them sprang from his horse, and while his companion held the bridle, threw six or eight of the loose planks into the stream; then remounted, and again galloped forward. The stream which this bridge covered was narrow, but deep, and ran between two hills, one of which Fraser and Bennet were ascending, as the British dragoons were rushing furiously down the other, towards the bridge, with their eyes fixed on the objects of their pursuit, whom they now considered as certainly within their grasp. “Forward!” exclaimed their leader. It was his last exclamation, in the next moment both horse and rider were precipitated through the timbers into the stream; three of his followers shared the same fate, and the rest narrowly escaped by suddenly checking their steeds. The pursuit was then relinquished, while Fraser and Bennet arrived at the American camp in safety. The British forces arrived only in time to find themselves without shelter or batteries, and were obliged to fall back to Queenston, from whence M`Clure in vain attempted to dislodge them by the batteries at Lewiston. The inhabitants of Newark had twelve hours notice to remove their effects, and those who chose to cross the river, were liberally provided with all the necessaries of life. It was now very reasonable to expect some retaliatory measure on the part of the enemy, and to be in readiness to meet such measure was the primary object of the American commander. He therefore left captain Leonard in command of Fort Niagara, with about one hundred and sixty effective regulars, and pointed out verbally, and particularly in a general order, how he should prepare for an attack, which he assured him would certainly take place. He then stationed colonel Grieves' artillerists, consisting of about twenty men, with two pieces of artillery, at Lewiston, under the command of major Bennet, and made them a present of four hundred dollars for volunteering their services three weeks. About forty Canadian volunteers, who had previously espoused the American cause, he stationed at Schlosser, under major Mallory, an officer of great merit, and then transferred his head-quarters to Buffalo, to provide for the safety of that place and Black Rock, having first made arrangements for calling out all the neighboring militia en masse. Notwithstanding M`Clure's positive orders, Leonard neglected to prepare for an attack, which every one knew would shortly be made; and on the evening of the eighteenth of December, he left the fort, in company with Sandford, at about eleven o'clock. Sandford crossed the river, and Leonard took up his quarters at a farm-house, two miles distant from the Fort, the principal gate of which was left open. At four o'clock the next morning, about four hundred of the enemy, white and red, crossed the river, and entered the fort so silently, that the garrison was not alarmed until they had complete possession. The only resistance they met with, was from a guard in one of the block-houses, and a number of invalids in the hospital, who defended themselves until they were overpowered and put to death by the bayonet. A most horrid slaughter ensued, until above eighty of the Americans were butchered, and nearly twenty severely wounded. A non-commissioned officer and twenty privates, made their escape by scaling the pickets at the first alarm. As soon as the slaughter had ceased, and the survivors secured as prisoners, the private property in the fort was given up to plunder, and not a single article was restored to the owners. The women of the garrison were stripped of their apparel, and many of them wantonly killed; the persons of the dead officers were treated with shocking indignity. After the enemy had become complete masters of the fort, Leonard arrived, and was made prisoner. The British flag was then unfurled, and the enemy had the entire command of the mouth of the Niagara. Lewiston was attacked the same morning by above seven hundred Indians, and bravely defended by the gallant Bennet, and his little detachment of militia, who resisted the assailants until entirely surrounded. Bennet then desperately cut his way through the enemy's ranks, and effected his retreat with the loss of eight men. Lewiston, Youngstown, Manchester, and the Indian Tuscarora, were all speedily reduced to ashes, and many of the men, women, and children, massacred as they fled from the conflagration. The brave Mallory, who commanded the forty Canadian volunteers at Schlosser, boldly advanced against the Indians while they were in the act of setting fire to Lewiston, and attacked them with such impetuosity that they were compelled to fall back to the foot of the mountain. The Indians, however, were soon reinforced, and the gallant Mallory was in turn obliged to retire. In the course of the same month, Buffalo also shared the fate of Lewiston,and the whole Niagara frontier was rapidly laid waste by the enemy, and entirely depopulated. All the settlements in a section of country forty miles square, and which contained more than twelve thousand souls, were effectually broken up. The roads were filled with fugitives from the scene of devastation, of every age, sex, and condition, many of whom had been reduced from a state of competence and fair prospects, to the last degree of want and sorrow. Many of them had beheld their dearest connexions fall beneath the tomahawk, and horribly mangled without distinction of sex or age. With so much terror were they dispersed, that in some instances, mothers found themselves wandering with strange children, while the fate of their own offspring was altogether unknown to them. The sympathy of their fellow-citizens was soon awakened by their sufferings, and such relief afforded them as their immediate bodily wants demanded. But what relief could reach their distressed minds? Who could restore a murdered wife—infant—husband—sister—brother! Scarcely a family had fled that would ever again meet all its members in this world; for the same violence which had reduced them to beggary, and turned them naked into a northern wilderness, in the dead of winter, had also severed the ties which united them, by lopping from every family-tree some of its most flourishing branches. The enemy had been obstinately opposed in his advance against Buffalo, by two or three hundred raw and undisciplined militia, commanded by colonel Blakeslie, who proved himself a hero on the occasion, as did likewise all his officers, among whom was the gallant Riddle, who had previously distinguished himself at Little-York. Fraser, who was now major of a battalion of Indians,[30] [30] These Indians cherished so great an affection for Fraser, that they adopted him as one of the chiefs of their tribe, and gave him the name of “The-Black-Wolf,” or “Walk-All-Night.” was wounded in this affair, after making several prisoners on the margin of the village. After laying waste the country, reducing every village to ashes, and inflicting unheard-of cruelties on the defenceless inhabitants, the enemy retired from every position he had occupied in the American territory, except Fort Niagara, which he put in a better state of defence, and from it made frequent excursions, which were generally attended by acts of violence and cruelty. Stern Winter had now taken the field, with his boisterous northern forces, and all military operations were for a time suspended between belligerent mortals. During this temporary truce, the regular troops in the northern military district of New-York were under the command of the heroic Brown, who was laboriously and constantly employed in providing for their comfort and good order, and in improving and familiarizing himself in the theory and practice of modern tactics. When a plan of the ensuing campaign was adopted by government, the execution of it on the Niagara frontier was committed to Brown; he was accordingly promoted to the rank of major-general, and took the field early in the spring. The gallant Scott spent a great part of the winter at Albany. Early in March, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, and joined Brown there, on his route to the Niagara frontier, early in the following April. Soon after, Brown was recalled to Sacket's Harbor, and the command in consequence devolved on Scott, who immediately assembled the army, and established a camp of instruction at Buffalo. Here, without regard to rank, all the officers were rigorously drilled by the commanding general in person; these in their turn drilled the privates; in a short time the army was perfectly organized, and, by the unwearied exertions and example of Scott, the strictest routine and discipline were established throughout the whole. Fraser spent the winter with his friends, and the following spring was appointed senior lieutenant in the third rifle regiment, and ordered to the south; upon which he repaired to Washington and declined the appointment, preferring to retain his old grade and to fight in company with his old friends, to recruiting in the south. Porter solicited the war-department for the services of Fraser as his aid-de-camp, engaging to give him a command of Indians whenever an opportunity offered for employing them. The secretary of war immediately conceded to the wishes of the 47 brave young officer, and promoted him in his own regiment. Captain Willoughby remained with the northern army in winter-quarters at French Mills; and when off duty amused himself in writing to his friends and completing his journal, an extract from which shall be given in the next chapter. He had received a letter from Fleming, dated at Quebec, the fourth of November, who informed him that he was there closely confined, and was threatened to be detained as a British subject, and tried for holding a commission in the American militia. This distressing intelligence, George immediately communicated to his father, but carefully withheld it from Catharine.</field>

To keep mine honor from corruption, But such an honest chronicler. Shakspeare. On the fourth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirteen, the anniversary of American independence was celebrated, as usual, throughout the United States. It was also celebrated by a little guard of twelve Americans, who occupied Fort Schlosser, near Niagara falls, whose festive rites were unfortunately interrupted by a nocturnal visit from the enemy, who completely surprised the guard, made them all prisoners, and conveyed them across the river, together with one brass six-pounder, fifty-seven stand of arms, a quantity of ammunition, salt, tobacco, pork and whiskey. July 11. The enemy crossed the river, and made an attack on Black Rock, set fire to the barracks, block-house, and other buildings, spiked several pieces of cannon, and took off a quantity of provisions. Whilst carying the property to their boats, they were attacked by a force of regulars, militia, and a few Indians, who poured upon them a very destructive fire, and compelled them to take to their boats, with the loss of more than fifty killed and wounded. General Porter and major King were very active on this occasion. July 21. Lieutenant Colonel Christie, of New-York, who signalized himself at the battle of Queenston, died at Fort George. August 2. Fort Stephenson besieged, and gallantly defended by major Croghan, &amp;c. August 4. The privateer Decatur, captain Diron, captured the British armed schooner Dominico, captain Barrette, after the most obstinate and bloody battle ever recorded in the annals of naval warfare. August 14. The United States brig Argus, captain Allen, captured by the English sloop of war Pelican, captain Maples, after a desperate action of forty-five minutes, in the commencement of which captain Allen received a mortal wound, and expired on the fourth day after the battle. On board the Argus there were six killed and seventeen wounded—five of the latter died soon after the engagement. The loss of the Pelican was only three killed and five wounded. In recording the death of this gallant young officer, the journalist feels the tenderest sympathies of his nature awakened. The deceased was his friend, and both affection and patriotism prompt him to pay a tribute to his memory. He was a hero—for the man who bravely contends with a superior force, until (finding defeat inevitable) he sacrifices his life for his country, deserves all the plaudits to which the more successful victor is entitled. Allen signalized himself in the action between the United States and Macedonian, and was soon afterwards appointed to command the Argus, and conduct the American minister to France; from France he was to proceed to the Irish channel, and there cruise for the enemy's merchant vessels. This was a very perilous, and, at the same time, a very invidious service to a young officer thirsting for glory. His orders were to burn, sink, and destroy the enemy's property; but in performing this duty, (to the amount of two millions pounds sterling) he was careful to distinguish his character from those who depredated for selfish purposes only. The property of the passengers was always held sacred as their persons. For more than two months he continued in this service, and while his enemies lamented their losses through his vigilance, they all united in paying the tribute due to the generosity, humanity, and delicacy, which he exercised to all who fell into his power. At length the Pelican was fitted out expressly to capture him; she succeeded, and took her prize into Plymouth. Allen had been wounded in the leg, and had submitted to amputation above the knee, at sea; but the shattered state of his thigh precluded all surgical aid. When he was removed from the Argus to the hospital at Plymouth, he cast his languid eyes on his faithful comrades, and feelingly exclaimed—“God bless you, my lads!—we shall never meet again.” He was sensible, at intervals, till within ten minutes of his dissolution, when he sunk exhausted, and expired without a struggle. His lucid intervals were very cheerful; and he was satisfied and fully sensible that no advice or assistance could save his life. On Saturday, the twenty-first, he was interred with the usual honors of war, at Plymouth, together with midshipman Delphy, (who had both legs shot from his body at the same instant) and midshipman Edwards. This article shall be closed with the following extract from his last letter, addressed to his sister—“When “you shall hear that I have ended my earthly ca “reer, that I only exist in the kind remembrance of “my friends, you will forget my follies, forgive “my faults, call to mind some little instances dear “to reflection, to excuse your love for me—and “shed one tear to the memory of Henry.” August 30.

Captain Finch distinguished himself on this occasion. October 25. Hampton's army was attacked on its march down the Chateaugay; and, after losing about fifty men, in various skirmishes, retreated to a place called the Four Corners. In these skirmishes general Izard, colonel Purdy, major Snelling and major Wood, were particularly distinguished. November 2. General Coffee obtained a complete victory over the Creek Indians, at a place called Tallushatches, during which the following officers were conspicuous for their courage and good conduct—colonels Allcorn and Cannon; captains Smith, Bradley, Winton, and Hammond; and lieutenant Patterson. November 9.

December 30. The British landed two thousand men at Black Rock, and burnt that village, together with Buffalo, after an obstinate resistance made by a few militia. January 5, 1814. A Court Martial assembled at Albany for the trial of brigadier-general Hull, on the charges of treason, cowardice, and unofficer-like conduct, in surrendering Detroit, &amp;c. Dearborn was president of this court, which consisted of colonels Fenwick, Carberry, Little, and Irvine; lieutenant-colonels Dennis, Conner, Davis, Scott, and Stewart. January 17. Decatur's squadron being still blockaded in the harbor of New-London, the commodore sent a challenge to the commanders of two of the blockading frigates, (the Endymion and Statira) to meet the United States and Macedonian in the Sound, unmolested by any other vessel, and try their fortune in a fair engagement. The challenge was declined. January 19. The Senate of the United States confirmed the nomination of Messrs. Adams, Bayard, Clay, and Russell as ministers plenipotentiary, to treat for peace with the British commissioners at Gottenburg. January 21. General Jackson made a daring incursion among the Creeks, to the bend of the Tallapoosa, and obtained three complete victories, in as many days, after some very gallant fighting, in which he lost twenty killed and seventy-five wounded, while above two hundred of the enemy were left dead on the field. In these several engagements, the following officers were particularly distinguished—general Coffee, colonels Sitler, Carroll, and Higgins; captains Ferril, Russell, Bradford, M`Govock, Gordon, Elliott, Pipkins, Hamilton, and Quarles, the two last of whom were slain; also lieutenant Armstrong, and gunners Perkins and Jackson, of the artillery. January 27. The Creeks attacked general Floyd in his encampment, forty-eight miles west of Chatahouchee, and were repulsed with great loss.

The conduct of these officers, together with that of lieutenant Sheldon, and major Forsyth, was so conspicuously gallant as to attract the admiration of their brethren in arms. General Wilkinson, Smith, Bissell, and M`Comb, displayed their usual firmness and intrepidity in the hour of peril; and colonels Miller and Clark, were, as usual, brave, active, and ardent. April 14.

May 6. Fort Oswego captured by eighteen hundred British, after a gallant resistance for two days, by three hundred Americans, under lieutenant-colonel Mitchell. The British lost nineteen killed and seventy-five wounded; the American loss was six killed, thirty-eight wounded, and twenty-six missing. Lieutenant Blaney, a young man of much promise, and whose conduct through the action was highly meritorious, was among the slain. Captains Pierce, Boyle, Romayne, Melvin, M`Intire, and Woolsey, together with lieutenants Pearce and Legate, received their commander's warmest encomiums for their gallantry and good conduct; as did, also, the subalterns M`Comb, Ansart, Ring, Robb, Earl, M`Clintock, and Newkirk. May 30. Major Appling, with one hundred and twenty riflemen, and a few Indians, proceeded to Sandy Creek, on the British shore of Lake Ontario, and after a smart action captured two gunboats and five barges, with one hundred and seventy-five British, who lost fourteen killed and twenty-eight wounded, while the Americans had only one wounded. For this gallant achievement Appling was brevetted a lieutenant-colonel, and his officers, lieutenants M`Intosh, Calhoun, M`Farland, Armstrong, and Smith, and ensign Austin, were publicly thanked by the commanding general officer at Sacket's Harbor. Captain Woolsey, of the Navy, and his officers, lieutenant Pearce, sailing-master Vaughan, and midshipmen Mackey, Hart, and Caton, acquitted themselves in a courageous and masterly manner. June 1. Lieutenant-colonel Pearson, with two hundred and fifty North-Carolina militia, and seventy Indians, scoured the banks of the Alabama, and made six hundred and twenty-two Indian prisoners, consisting of men, women, and children. June 9. The French government brig Olivier, arrived at New-York, under the white flag, with official accounts of the downfall of Bonaparte, and the restoration of Louis XVIII. June 11. The barges belonging to the British squadron in Massachusetts Bay, entered Scituate Harbor, and set fire to all the vessels lying there, except two or three which they took away as prizes. Those which they destroyed were the property of ensign Otis, captain John Manson, Messrs. Elms and Curtis, and Jesse Dunbar. Captain Dunbar was compelled to pilot one of the vessels out of the harbor, but was afterwards liberated and treated very civilly. About this time, they also entered Wareham, under cover of a flag of truce, and fired the stores and shipping in that place. June 19. Lieutenant Gregory, a very brave and accomplished officer, belonging to Chauncey's squadron, had been ordered by his commodore to proceed down the St. Lawrence, with a small party, in three gigs, secret himself in some of the islands, and watch a favorable opportunity to surprise a brigade of store-boats belonging to the enemy, and either bring them off, or destroy them. The enemy, however, discovered him, and sent a gun-boat in pursuit, when he instantly formed the bold design to board her, which he did, and carried her without losing a man, one of the enemy being badly wounded. She proved to be a fine gun-boat, manned with eighteen men, chiefly chiefly royal marines. Gregory manned his prize, and proceeded up the river, but was pursued by another large gun-boat, which over-hauled him fast. He kept possession of his prize until the enemy threw their shot over him; he then very reluctantly took out his prisoners, scuttled her, and effected his escape with all his prisoners. June 19. The new frigate Guerriere was launched at Philadelphia. June 22. The Independence, 74, launched at Boston. June 28. The gallant lieutenant-colonel Forsyth, made an incursion into Canada as far as Odelltown, where an affair took place with a detachment of the enemy, from the post of La Cole. The colonel made an attack, retreated, and attempted to draw the enemy into an ambuscade; but, in his zeal, discovered himself and his party too soon, and an action commenced before the British were ensnared. After killing seventeen of their number, Forsyth received a 48 wound in the neck, of which he died in a few days after, and was buried with military honors at Champlain. Thus ended the career of glory in which this enterprising officer was engaged. He had lived the terror of his enemies, and he died deeply lamented by his friends. A braver officer the army never lost. June 28. The United States sloop of war Wasp, captain Blakely, captured and destroyed the English sloop of war Reindeer, captain Manners, after an action of nineteen minutes, in which the enemy lost twenty-five killed and forty-two wounded; while the American loss was only five killed and twenty-one wounded. June 30. Lieutenant Gregory surprised the British at Presque'Isle, on Lake Ontario, and burnt a large schooner which was building there. The foregoing is a brief sketch of the journal kept by captain Willoughby, for one year. It is probable that I may hereafter furnish my readers with another extract from the same manuscript; but at present I must request the favor of their company to Ithaca, where the lovely, disconsolate Catharine demands our attendance; and as I shall convey them thither without the least trouble or expense, I trust that they will have no cause to regret the journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXI. AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY. —Sure some ill fate's upon me: Distrust and heaviness sit round my heart, And apprehension shocks my timorous soul. Otway's Orphan. The spirits of Catharine were, for some time, supported by the hope of her father's speedy restoration to liberty; which hope was assiduously cherished by her friends in Ithaca, and by the letters of major Willoughby, Amelia, and George. But, “hope deferred maketh the heart sick,” and before the winter had half expired, the heart of Catharine had become cheerless as the season. A settled melancholy took possession of her soul, blanched her sunken cheeks, and dimmed the mild lustre of her humid eyes. In vain her affectionate aunt strove to impart comfort and peace to her afflicted bosom; and equally fruitless were the assiduities of her gay young cousin. She faintly smiled her thanks for their tender exertions, and eagerly retired to that solitude in which she could yield to the impulse of her feelings, and weep unobserved. About the middle of January, she was deprived of the enlivening society of her cousin, who commenced a tour to the southward, for the purpose of consummating a matrimonial negociation which had been commenced previous to the death of his father, while the lover was a clerk in a compting-house at New-Orleans. The object of his attachment was the daughter of his employer, an opulent merchant in that city, who most cordially approved his daughter's choice, and only withheld his consent until the young gentleman should become of age. This period had now arrived, and young Woodcock, rich in wealth, love, and honor, commenced the journey which was to terminate in the bower of connubial felicity. He was not expected to return short of a twelvemonth. As the spring approached, the health of Mrs. Woodcock began to decline; until, at length, her complaint assumed the alarming symptoms of a confirmed dropsy; and before midsummer she was unable to leave her chamber. Catharine began now to fear that Heaven would spare her no friends to console or protect her. The idea of being soon thrown on the wide world, a friendless orphan, was ever present to her imagination, and had not Hope still whispered the name of Willoughby, she would have soon fallen a victim to melancholy, and only looked, only asked for peace beyond the grave. Thus drooping in despondency, every image presented to her imagination received a tincture of gloom from the sombre medium through which she beheld it, while the dæmon of melancholy sat like an Incubus on her heart, and retarded the circulation of its fluids. Deprived of her parents—dependent on the bounty of others, and far distant from the dearest object of her affections, she felt like an insulated, deserted being— an exile, friendless and alone. Nay, her gloomy fancy even suggested doubts of that affection with which the bosom of our hero so ardently glowed. “If he really loved me, (thought she) would he thus endure the anguish of so long a separation? Would he not have abandoned every other pursuit, and flown to give me comfort, when the news of my sorrows first reached him? Alas! he does not—cannot love like me! Catharine may sink under her afflictions, and George will then too late lament his neglect and voluntary absence. He will be very unhappy that he did not see me before I died!” Such free indulgence did she give to these melancholy fancies, and so tenderly did she cherish them, that they became established in her mind for facts, and she actually wrote to her lover bidding him an affectionate adieu, and hoping to meet him in that world to which she was rapidly hastening. My readers shall have a peep at this epistle in another place, if they will exercise a little patience. It was near the close of a beautiful day in the beginning of July. Catharine was seated on a sofa by the side of her aunt, whom she was regaling with a page of her favorite Hervey, when the servant announced a gentleman who wished to see Miss Fleming. Catharine's heart beat very rapidly at that moment, but it sunk in disappointment when she saw a stranger enter the room. His stature was a little below the common size, his features coarse and his manners unpolished. He approached the ladies with a bow, and then with a downcast look and hesitating voice, accosted Catharine— “Miss Fleming, I am a messenger from your father.” “O, where is he?” exclaimed they, both at once. “How is my father?” “Where is my brother?” 48* “Mr. Fleming is in New-York—not so well in health as I could wish—but—” “Oh! he is dead! My poor father is dead!” exclaimed Catharine bursting into tears. “I know it by your manner—I can read it in your looks. Oh! aunt—we shall never see him more!” “Your fears overstep the fact,” replied the stranger. “He is not dead. True, he is ill— very ill; but he may yet recover. This letter, though not written by his own hand, was dictated by his own lips, and will explain the purport of my embassy.” So saying, he delivered the letter to Catharine, and took a seat near the sofa. The agitated girl summoned all her little strength to break the seal, and then read aloud as follows: “New-York, June 26th, 1814. “Be not alarmed, my daughter, that this letter is not written by your father's hand. That hand is, alas! too much enfeebled by disease to hold a pen; I have, therefore, employed that of my most excellent friend, captain Miller, who has generously offered to make a journey to Ithaca for the sole purpose of conveying to you the last injunctions and blessing of your affectionate father.” “O let me fly to him instantly!” exclaimed the distressed girl, rising and advancing to the messenger. “He will die among strangers, and I shall never see him. Let us go immediately!” “Be composed, my love,” replied her aunt. “Your father may not be so dangerously ill as you imagine. At any rate, you must not think of undertaking such a journey alone, and you know I am unable to accompany you.” “Let me intreat you to be more composed, Miss Fleming,” said captain Miller, affectionately taking her hand. “Endeavor to summon sufficient fortitude to finish reading that letter, and then I will speak further of your father.” After a short struggle with her tears, Catharine could again distinguish the characters on the paper she held, and thus continued to read— “My long captivity, close confinement, and sorrow of heart, have all conspired to destroy my constitution; and my health is now so much impaired, that I have very little hopes of its restoration. Several of your letters reached me in Canada, and each of them afforded me comfort, except that in which you mentioned the illness of my sister. But we must learn to be resigned to every event that may befal us, and hope for our reward in another life. “Be attentive to your aunt, my child, while she is spared to you, for I fear that you are destined to be an orphan. I dare not say how ardently I wish to see you, because the journey is of such prodigious length. Captain Miller, (under whose hospitable roof I meet the most delicate attention) insists upon visiting you in his own carriage, and making you the companion of his return. I have objected to laying any member of my family under such an immense obligation to a friend; but in this proposition he is so earnestly seconded by his amiable sister, who wishes to accompany him, that I have finally consented for them to make the journey, leaving it to your own discretion, whether it will be prudent to undertake so arduous a task in the present state of your health. “Should we never again meet on earth, may the choicest blessings of Heaven attend your steps through life, and its mercy restore you to the embraces of your parents in another world. Adieu, my child—adieu. “Henry Fleming.” “O, sir, let us depart instantly—another moment may be too late. I am resolved to accompany you—dear aunt, make no objections—it is to see a dying father—to close his eyes—” Choked with grief, she now sunk exhausted on the sofa. The aunt was herself much affected, and a tear trembled in the stranger's eye. “Where have you left your sister?” asked Mrs. Woodcock. “In the carriage at the door, ready to pay her respects here, as soon as I had prepared the way for an introduction. With your leave, I will now show her up.” Captain Miller left the room, and in a moment after returned with a very pretty female in the plain dress of a quakeress, whom he introduced as Julia Miller. Though small of stature, her shape was symmetry itself; the flush of health bloomed on her cheeks, the flash of vivacity sparkled in her jet black eye, and her whole countenance was expressive and animated. She gracefully approached Catharine, took a seat by her side, and in the most tender manner, endeavored to soothe her sorrows and inspire her with hope and consolation. She so far succeded that the latter began to make arrangements for her departure with a considerable degree of composure. At sunrise the next morning, the carriage of captain Miller, containing himself, his sister, and Catharine, was on the road to Owego, and before dark arrived at Unadilla. Another day's journey brought them to Bethel, a third to Goshen, and a fourth to Peramus, a village in Jersey, on a branch of the celebrated Passaic, about twenty miles from New-York. As they approached the city, the weeping Catharine became more and more agitated—she trembled to encounter the moment which was to dispel her doubts, and perhaps confirm her worst fears. Still, however, she grew more impatient of delay, and imagined that the last day's journey was very tardily performed. There was indeed some grounds for such an idea, for the driver affirmed that one of the horses had sprained a leg, and could not proceed with his usual speed. They dined at Hackensack, and were obliged to tarry two hours after dinner while a blacksmith repaired some part of the carriage. This, together with some unavoidable subsequent delays, so retarded their progress, that the sun was setting when the carriage drove into the steam-boat at Powles-Hook. In a few minutes more, Catharine found herself in the city where she had first landed on her emigration to America, but where she was now a total stranger. The carriage rattled onward over the pavements of Cortlandt-street, and Catharine awaited in silence the moment that it was to stop at the door of captain Miller, which, Julia had previously informed her, was at No. 176 Chatham-square. It was now quite dark, and her impatience increased; her companions had become silent and thoughtful, while her own reflections were of the most gloomy cast. The crisis of her fate was at hand—either she was to find herself already a helpless orphan, or had arrived in season to receive the verbal blessing and close the eyes of a dying father. The carriage still rolled on, and she wondered what remote corner of the city was called Chatham-square. At length they stopped in front of a genteel looking house. Miller sprang from the carriage and handed out the ladies, whom he conducted into the house in silence. “Courage, my dear,” said Julia to Catharine as she felt her tremble while she supported her into the house—“In a moment you will embrace your father.” “Ah! if he be still living,” replied Catharine. An elderly lady now met them in the hall, to whom Julia introduced Catharine, and who informed her that her father was much better. “O lead me to him instantly,” cried Catharine. “Better or worse, I must see him while my strength remains.” “He has just fallen into a sweet sleep,” replied the lady, “and I fear your agitation would disturb him. Compose yourself a few minutes, and swallow some refreshments, which you very much stand in need of, and then you shall be gratified.” Catharine felt that she did indeed require rest and refreshment, and therefore suffered herself to be led by Julia and her mother into a back parlor, where tea was already prepared, and of which the young ladies partook without changing their travelling dresses. During this little repast, Catharine's mind received still more relief than her exhausted frame, for the cheerful old lady gave her such encouraging accounts of her father's health, and assurances of his convalescence, that Catharine's bosom bounded with hope, and her countenance wore even an occasional smile. “His physician was here but a few moments before you arrived,” continued the good hostess, “and after administering an opiate, assured both him and myself that nothing would prove so great a restorative as sleep, and begged that he might not be disturbed. He began to recover four days ago, and has frequently expressed his regret that he permitted his daughter to be alarmed by the steps that had been taken. He set up to-day for several hours, appeared very cheerful, and had a very flattering appetite. I congratulate you, my dear Miss Fleming, on the good news it is my happiness to communicate. One half hour more of sleep, will make a new man of him.” In this manner the old lady ran on, as she handed the tea and cake to the young ones, and Catharine suffered the half-hour to expire with a tolerable degree of patience. She then renewed her request to be conducted to her father, whom she promised not to disturb while he appeared disposed to sleep; she only wished to sit by him and watch his slumbers until he awoke. The old lady now consented, and led her up stairs to a chamber very elegantly furnished, where a candle was burning. “There lies your father,” said she in a whisper, “on that sofa. Take a seat by him, and in a few moments Julia and I will rejoin you. Be careful and not disturb him. Excuse me for a few minutes.” Catharine approached the sofa, and for a moment hesitated, before she could summon sufficient fortitude to raise the cloak which covered that face she so much wished, yet so dreaded to behold. “Perhaps (thought she) it is so emaciated by disease, that I shall not be able to trace the features; how shall I support the shock which I must experience on contemplating the ravages of sickness in the countenance of the best of fathers.” With a trembling hand, she raised the covering, but the arm of the sofa so shaded the visage that its emaciated appearance was not visible. She bent over him a moment in silence, and then obeyed the irresistible impulse of her feelings, by stooping down and imprinting on his lips a kiss of filial affection.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXII. A DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS. —What is't a woman cannot do? She'll make a statesman quite forget his cunning. And trust his dearest secrets to her breast. Otway. During our hero's unfortunate connection with Sophia, in her two characters, she had drawn much more largely on his confidence than he himself was aware of. What he had withheld from Reuben, had been obtained by the artful Sophia; and that which it was improper to tell Sophia, had been previously communicated to Reuben. She knew the whole history of his attachment for Catharine, his former connextion with Sandford, and the cause of their present enmity. No sooner, therefore, was she dismissed by Willoughby, than she determined to make Sandford the instrument of her revenge; and accordingly repaired immediately to his quarters, told her story, and proposed an alliance, offensive and defensive, which was immediately agreed to and ratified. Sandford was soon afterwards ordered to Fort Niagara, in the neighborhood of which he took genteel lodgings for Sophia, who resumed the habiliments of her sex, and unblushingly avowed herself the mistress of Sandford. But Sophia's favors were not exclusively bestowed on her nominal protector; officers of superior rank, whose reputation the breath of suspicion never sullied, secretly enjoyed her caresses, and the mighty Achilles of the day, was often the melting Paris of the evening. Proud of her conquests, and more ambitious of subduing rank than of attracting beauty, she aspired to assail some of the most elevated objects within the sphere of her fascinations, nor aspired in vain. Revolutionary laurels were cast at her feet, while age and infirmity reposed on her ambitious bosom. Sandford was too well versed in the character of fallen woman, to expect constancy in a mistress. Feeling no affection for Sophia, he winked at her incontinence, and only retained her as an apt instrument for which he hoped soon to find employment in the schemes of vengeance he was meditating against captain Willoughby. But though it was the principal study of both to discharge the debt of hatred they owed our hero, still no opportunity occurred of bringing any of their diabolical plans to maturity; and the object of their malice was daily rising in the estimation 49 of all, except such wretches as were concerting his ruin. The destination of the northern army remained a secret to the nation—but by some means or other, this secret (among many others) found its way to the bosom of Sophia, and was by her imparted to Sandford. The town of Kingston was to be attacked, and in its then present state of defence, must certainly fall before the American arms. The object of Sandford's hatred would here again signalize himself, and rise still higher above him in reputation—perhaps in rank. He knew of no way to prevent the success of the expedition, and could only vent his spleen in curses. The mother of Sandford was a native of Kingston, and all his maternal relatives were still British subjects. His uncle Morris, with whom he had been in the habit of corresponding previous to the war, owned a very valuable farm on the peninsula, a few miles from Newark, near the lake shore, on which he still resided. This man had, more than once, since the commencement of hostilities, solicited his nephew to abandon the American cause, and embrace that in which all his maternal kinsmen were engaged. To these solicitations Sandford paid little attention, until they were renewed with a promise, on the part of his uncle, to make him his heir, as he had no child of his own. He now began to reflect seriously on the subject, and finally signified his resolution to comply, as soon as he could sell his estates in Massachusetts, and by some bold act of treachery render his desertion of service to the British. The estates were soon sold by his agent, and the money vested according to his directions. He now only awaited a favorable opportunity of putting the more hazardous part of his scheme into execution. Ever ripe for mischief, Sophia readily entered into the plan, and proposed such amendments and improvements as filled Sandford with admiration at her ready invention and deep discerning subtilty. She had recently and suddenly conceived a most mortal hatred against some military character, which at that time stood high in public estimation, and she determined, if possible, to blast his prospects of approaching glory. A consultation was held on the subject, and Sandford instantly perceived that the same weapon which was to pierce a general, might also wound a captain. During a temporary absence of Leonard, Sandford had command of the garrison at Niagara, and in the following night dispatched a boat on a short but secret expedition up the lake. Reuben was a young officer who had volunteered his services to enter the British camp as a spy, and as not only his life, but also the success of the American arms depended on secrecy, the boatmen were charged to that effect. Their instructions were to proceed with muffled oars about ten miles towards the head of the lake, land the officer, and return with as much expedition as possible. Having the necessary directions, Reuben proceeded from the shore to the house of Morris, which was about two miles from the head-quarters of De Rottenberg, and announced himself as the messenger of Sandford. He was of course received with a cordial welcome, and on the following day, the interview took place which was witnessed by Willoughby and Cummins, as recorded in the fifty-sixth chapter of this history. Agreeably to instructions, Reuben tarried with Morris, until joined by Sandford himself, which event did not take place until the morning of the nineteenth of December, when Fort Niagara was betrayed to the enemy. With the subsequent events on that frontier, the reader is already acquainted. So disastrous a termination of the campaign, filled every patriot bosom with surprise and indignation. The representatives of the people immediately demanded of the president the causes of these disgraceful effects; and, in obedience to this demand, the records of the war-department were submitted to public inspection. But little light, however, was thrown upon the subject from that quarter, and it still remained enveloped in the gloom of doubt and uncertainty. This cloud is finally removed—a flash of inspiration from the historic muse, has at length dissipated the illusive vapors of conjecture, and the reader can now trace the whole concatenation of disasters to the black eyes, and still blacker heart of Sophia. To repair the misfortunes and redeem the honor of the American arms, was the grand object on which the congregated wisdom of the nation was now exercised; the first step to the attainment of this desirable end, was the abandonment of that system of favoritism to which the recent disasters were thought to be attributable. The materials of the army had now been effectually analyzed in a crucible well calculated to separate the gold from the dross, and it only required the exercise of common discernment to profit by the experiment. To borrow the lan guage of an elegant writer on the same subject— “The rude northern gales of the frontier had swept away the painted insects which rise and spread their glittering wings in the summer's sun, but had served only to rouse and invigorate those eagle spirits who, during the calm, cower undisturbed in solitude and silence, but as the tempest pises, burst from their obscurity, and stem the storm, and sport themselves in the gale.”[32] [32] Captain Treat commanded a picket-guard, which on its return to camp, (at the commencement of the action) was assailed, in a meadow of high grass, by a brisk discharge of musketry. One man fell, severely wounded, and the rear of the guard broke and retreated. Captain Treat's attempts to prevent the flight of the left of his detachment, were mistaken for an intention to avoid the enemy; and though be was ordered to a neighboring wood, his guard being first collected in pursuit of the party that had attacked him, he was immediately after stripped of his command, upon the ground of cowardice, in retreating before the enemy, and of misconduct, in abandoning the wounded man to their mercy. This man had, however, been brought in by captain Treat's orders, previously to his march in quest of the enemy's party. Being resolved on a participation in some way or other in the approaching battle, the captain entered as a volunteer, in the same company which he had just before commanded; and the senior officer of the 21st regiment, directed him to lead a platoon into action. This act was considered as a manifestation of his courage and patriotism, and the court martial before which he was tried, dismissed him with an honorable acquittal. Thompson's Historical Sketches, p. 276. Brown, Scott, Ripley, Gaines, Swift, Miller, and some others of well-tried talents and courage, now stood forth as the bulwark of their country—the real CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM. Each of them commanded the confidence of their country; but, as commander in chief, the eyes of every unprejudiced freeman were directed to Brown, and government confirmed their choice by elevating that hero to the rank of major-general. Being thus selected by his admiring countrymen as their military chief on the Niagara frontier, he lost no time in concentrating and organizing his army, determined to drive the British from the peninsula, and regain possession of the fortresses on both sides the river. Captain Willoughby being destitute of a command, volunteered his services as aid to the general, who gladly accepted the assistance of an officer in whose talents and courage he possessed such implicit confidence. Fort Erie was to be the first object of attack, and on the morning of the second of July, the commander in chief authorised the generals of brigades, to inform the commandants of corps, that the army would cross 49* the strait on the following night, so as to invest that fortress as the next day dawned. Every bosom now beat high with anticipated glory, and all were anxious for the coming night. Before the night came, however, the following letter was delivered to captain Willoughby. “Ithaca, June 29, 1814. “Adieu, my dearest, best friend—adieu, until we meet in that world where parting will be no more. I should feel guilty of an unpardonable neglect, did I longer delay to inform you that I am rapidly sinking beneath the iron hand of affliction. Grief for the loss of my parents has made such havoc with my constitution, that my health I fear can never be again restored. I shall never cease to love you—no, not even in heaven; next to my Saviour's, your image will be the object which I shall contemplate with the greatest delight, through the boundless ages of eternity. My greatest earthly comfort is the perusal of your affectionate epistles—this is the first I have ever written to you—it will be the last you must ever expect—preserve it as a legacy of my affection. I will not conceal—for why should I?—that your presence would soothe my dying hour, and that the transition would be sweet from your arms to those of my attendant angels, who are waiting to receive me. But I will not drag you from those higher duties to which you are called by your God and your country. Continue to serve both faithfully, and you will one day be again restored to your ever faithful “Catharine.” “Catharine dying!” exclaimed George, before he had finished the second line. “Catharine dying!—and I not with her! My horse! Albert— Where's my horse?” “Ready for embarkation,” replied his man, with those of the general's staff.” “Ah! we cross to-night,” replied George with a sigh—and after gazing a moment on the ground, resumed the perusal of his letter. A severe struggle now took place in his bosom—a contest far more dreadful than any which could await him on the peninsula. On one hand Duty, Patriotism, Honor, urged their imperious claims—on the other stood weeping Love and meek-eyed Pity, pointing in expressive silence to the dying Catharine. To ask leave of absence at that moment was worse than death—to lose his Catharine without one parting look, was worse than a thousand deaths. Another glance at the letter decided the contest. Nature triumphed—and the rising sun which beheld the banner of Freedom waving triumphantly on the walls of Fort Erie, saw captain Willoughby outflying the wind, with his back turned on the scene of glory. He had obtained leave of absence, and entered the village of Ithaca, just twelve hours after Catharine had left it. In the mean time the capture of Fort Erie was followed by a complete and decisive victory over a division of the British army, consisting of two thousand men, under the command of major-general Riall; and this victory was obtained by one American brigade of twelve hundred men, under the gallant Scott, who put the enemy to flight before the main body of the army was brought on the field. In this brilliant affair, (which took place on the plains of Chippewa, the fifth of July) the British loss was one hundred and forty-eight killed, three hundred and twenty wounded, and forty-six made prisoners. The American loss was sixty killed, two hundred and forty-nine wounded, and nineteen missing. Scott's brigade covered itself with glory; and Brown declared that its gallant leader was entitled to the highest praise his country could bestow. Generals Ripley and Porter conducted on this occasion as became officers of their exalted reputation. Colonel Campbell was wounded early in the action, while gallantly leading on his regiment. Colonel Gardner and major Jones, of the general's staff, yielded to none in honorable zeal, courage, intelligence, and attention to duty. Captains Austin and Spencer, who were aids to the commander in chief, received his public acknowledgments for their bravery and active zeal. Captain Willoughby, from whom he expected much, was not present to share in the glory of the day. Majors Jessup, Camp, Leavenworth, Wood, Hindman, and M`Niel; captains Towson, Daliba, Harrison, King, and Read; lieutenants Palmer, Barron, De Witt, Patchim, and Brimhall, (the eight last of whom were wounded—some of them severely) all rendered themselves conspicuous by their heroic conduct; as did likewise captains Treat,[33] [33] Analectic Magazine, vol. iv. p. 476. Ritchie, Ketcham, Crooker, Harris, and Riddle. Lieutenants Worth, and Watts, who were aids to Scott, together with Smith, M`Donald and Hall, signalized themselves by the cool intrepidity with which they discharged their various duties in the field.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXIII. A LOVER'S RACE. When love's well timed, 'tis not a fault to love; The strong, the brave, the virtuous, and the wise, Sink in the soft captivity together. Addison's Cato. It was not quite sunset, when George knocked at the door of the mansion which he believed contained the dear object of his precipitate journey —unless already relieved from her sufferings by death. A little black girl received him at the door, whom he followed, without ceremony, to the chamber of her mistress. With a palpitating heart he entered the room, where two or three elderly ladies were taking tea with Mrs. Woodcock, whom he instantly recognized by the external effects of her malady. After throwing a timid glance of enquiry round the room, he summoned sufficient firmness to name Catharine. “Poor girl!” exclaimed the aunt, wiping a tear from her eye; “we were just speaking of her—she has gone a long and melancholy journey.” Our hero had no idea of any journey that Catharine could be supposed to have taken, except that which every mortal is destined to perform. His worst fears were therefore now verified, and with a groan that seemed to rend his bosom, he rushed out of the room, without waiting for any further explanation, leaving the ladies to form their own opinions on the state of his intellect. His sudden entrance had not a little surprised them, for he had forgotten to announce his name; but his precipitate exit had heightened their surprise to wonder and astonishment. After wandering about in solitude and darkness, for more than two hours, George became somewhat composed, and again entered Mrs. Woodcock's apartment with as little ceremony as before. Her visiters had departed, and the good lady was now in consultation with her physician. For some moments our hero stood before them speechless; but at length in a faltering voice, he enquired— “When did the dear angel take her departure?” “My poor niece was taken away this morning at sunrise,” replied the aunt; and then after surveying George a moment, she added—“Have I not the pleasure, sir, of addressing captain Willoughby?” “Pardon my rudeness, madam. Major Willoughby is my father. Now suffer me to take one look at the form which enshrined so pure a soul. Let me have the melancholy satisfaction of beholding all that remains on earth of the lovely Catharine.” The good lady lost no time in undeceiving the bewildered George as to the nature and occasion of Catharine's long and melancholy journey, and the reader is left to conjecture his feelings, for I know of no language adequate to describe them. But among the various sensations which agitated his bosom, surprise was not the least. He had travelled a hundred and twenty miles in a few hours, to obtain a parting look from a dying mistress, and had arrived in season to learn that the object of his journey had just commenced one herself of twice the distance! His pleasure, however, was fully equal to his surprise, and early the next morning, (after receiving the address of captain Miller, which had been left with Mrs. Woodcock) he departed for New-York, and entered the steam-boat at Powles-Hook at the same time that Catharine landed at the foot of Courtlandt-street. He proceeded directly to the City-Hotel, and took lodgings for the night. On the following morning he proceeded directly to Chatham-square, and sought for the No. 176; but to his great surprise he perceived that there must have been some mistake in the direction he had received, as there was not so high a number in the square. He next knocked at every door, but no captain Miller was to be found. He then applied, with no better success, at every house and store in Chatham-street, from the Park to the Bowery, and from Catharine-street to Tammany-Hall. No captain Miller was to be heard of, nor any one of that name in this part of the city, except William H. Miller, saddler, and John S. Miller, broker. Not yet discouraged, he procured Longworth's Directory, and transcribed a list of all the Millers in the city, beginning with Aaron, the lamp-lighter, and ending with Zephaniah, the blacksmith, including Silvanus, the rev. Samuel, and above ninety others, all of whom he called upon in succession, without obtaining any intelligence of his Catharine. Nothing now remained, but to write an account of his ill-success to her aunt, and wait for her answer, which might furnish him with some clue to a discovery. On the following evening as he was strolling the promenade of the West Battery, he heard his name mentioned by some one behind him, and on turning his head encountered the eyes of Sophia, in company with two elegant females and three gentlemen, two of whom were in regimentals. Although much surprised at this unexpected meeting, George felt no inclination to address her, and to avoid her accosting him (were she so disposed) he immediately struck into another path and continued his contemplative ramble. In a few minutes, however, he met the same party before he was aware of it, when Sophia demanded, in an exulting tone— “Where is Miss Fleming?” There was a fiend-like expression lurking in the piercing eye of the speaker, that was visible in the moon-beam, and almost made George shudder as it met his view. A horrid presentiment of no definite shape or form flitted across his mind, as he replied to her question, while her party paused directly before him— “If you know, have compassion on me, and tell me.” “I will tell you,” answered she, while her aspect brightened with a demoniac pleasure. “I will tell you, or my vengeance will not be complete. Catharine Fleming is in the arms of your friend Sandford, and both are far beyond your reach. Shall I extend my compassion, and tell you who placed her there? “Born for your use, I live but to oblige you. “Know then, 'twas—I. “I forged the letter, I contrived the journey, “I hated, I despised, and I destroy.” Did I not tell you that I knew my instrument and that revenge should be mine? I am now revenged, and you may go shoot yourself.” So saying she walked on with her party, who seemed much delighted with her ready quotation from Zanga. After a little hesitation our hero turned to pursue them, hoping to gain some information that would remove the perplexing doubts and fears that now occupied his mind. “Shall I introduce you, major?” demanded an officer at his elbow. “I have the felicity of being a satellite of this new planet that has just arisen in our hemisphere, and if you wish to revolve in the same fashionable orbit, permit me to present you as my friend.” George stared at the speaker a moment, and then replied— “I am as ignorant of your meaning, sir, as you appear to be of my rank. I have not the honor of being a major.” 50 “O, sir, I beg ten thousand pardons—I hope no offence? I perceive my mistake now; but the first glance by moonlight deceived me—I took you for the major of our battalion—indeed I did.” “Your error is quite excusable, sir,” replied George. “Thank you, sir—thank you a thousand times, but my mistake arose from your gazing so wishfully after the party which has just passed us. Accept my arm, sir, and I will explain myself. You must know, sir, that the offer I inadvertently made to yourself, would have been highly gratifying to the major for whom I mistook you. Although a married man, he is a keen dog after forbidden game—well known at the Hermitage. Perhaps, sir, you are not acquainted at the Hermitage?” “I am not, sir.” “So much the better, because I shall have the pleasure of introducing you. Mrs. Beacham is a very accommodating lady—always glad to see her friends, of whom I have the honor to be one, sir, and shall be very proud to present you as a friend of mine.” “You are very kind, sir,” replied George, “and I entertain a due sense of the future honor you intend me. But having a little taste for astronomy, I should esteem it as a present favor, if you would say something more of the new planet you mentioned. Is it now visible?” “Good—very good—excellent!—Where do you buy your snuff, sir? The planet to which I allude is now visible—our evening star—a second Venus—she has totally eclipsed all her cotemporaries, and is at this moment in conjunction with Mars. But to descend from metaphor, sir, I mean that angel hanging to the colonel's arm—a diamond of the first water, just imported from— nobody knows where—and come consigned to— nobody knows who. It is, however, the general opinion among us, that she dropped from the heavens.” “She must be a fallen angel, then,” replied George, fixing his eye on Sophia, behind whom they continued to walk. “Good, sir—very good—excellent!—Where do you buy your snuff, sir? She is indeed one of the higher order of that fraternity; but entirely new—just initiated. Shall I introduce you, sir? Depend upon it, you may as well resign your commission, as decline so fashionable an acquaintance. You'll be thought nothing of, unless you move in her circle, and you see that she has nothing but plumes and epaulets in her train.” “I feel properly grateful for your kind intentions, sir,” answered our hero, smiling at the singular manners of the stranger, “but you must excuse me, at present, for declining the honor. Who are the others in company?” “What, the females?—You could not propose a question I can more easily answer. In these affairs, sir, I am a walking directory. One week ago those two females were goddesses—this evening they are something less than women.” “And what has so suddenly reduced them?” “Nothing else, sir, but the entrance of a new character, to whom all worship is now directed. She on the right, sometimes dashes through Broadway, driving herself tandum, with a cypher on her gig very much resembling an L. A certain great man, who shall be nameless, is said to employ many of his leisure moments in studying Harvey; and that, you will say, is good—very good—excellent!—when I inform you that the fair Cyprian's name is Sally Harvey. She on the left, has been a great beauty, and much caressed by the higher ranks, but is now also in the wane, from the cause aforesaid. Her name is Harriet—a very soft, pretty, poetical kind of a name; but is coupled with one not quite so smooth, and that is, Stagg. Once more—sir, shall I introduce you? No? Well, then I must bid you adieu, for they are leaving the Battery, and I am a satellite you know. Good night.” So saying, this military butterfly flew after the party, who had just reached the gate—leaving our hero at once amused and surprised at the first animal of the species he had ever met with. The day had been sultry, and the sea-breeze now felt peculiarly refreshing; our hero, therefore, continued to pace the area between the railing and the verdant parapet, until the company, which had been very numerous, gradually disappeared, and he at length found himself in solitude on this lately thronged promenade. The city clocks struck eleven, and he reluctantly moved from the delightful spot. As he turned the north angle of the parapet, a tall figure stood before him, in whom he instantly recognized his Mentor —the Mysterious Chief. With a respectful inclination of the body, George signified his attention, while the chief thus accosted him: M. C. Where did we last confer? George. On the western bank of the Niagara. M. C. What were then my parting words?— You hesitate, but you have not forgotten them. What was then your promise? George. To regulate my future conduct by the precept you gave me. M. C. And have you kept that promise? George. I have—as far as my ability extended. M. C. You deceive yourself. The banner of your country again waves over a fortress of your country's enemy. Why did not your hand assist to place it there? Why did George Washington Willoughby desert the standard of Freedom at the moment she required his services? George. Was there not a cause? M. C. No evil exists without one. But you have abandoned the service of your country, without serving any one. Your duty was plain, but you neglected to perform it. How is such conduct to be reconciled to my precept? You should have performed your duty, and trusted to Heaven for the rest. The cause you would plead is no more a palliation of the fault, than that of the adulterer or drunkard—“It is painful to desist.” So might the murderer say, and allude to his thirst for revenge. George. And is my journey then a crime? M. C. No—but the selfishness which prompted it, is an enemy to your happiness, and must therefore be overcome and reduced to a state of vassalage. Why have you not remembered my counsel? While you stood on the ground consecrated by your brave father's blood, I cautioned you against suffering a rival to engross those affections which were to be devoted to your country. Patriotism, I told you, must rise superior to all selfish considerations; and I assured you, that if any object was suffered to stand between you and duty—such object should be removed; for your country claimed you, and must have you undivided—entire. Do you remember this? George. I do. M. C. Such object is removed. George. O, pity me, and tell me where. 50* M. C. You have this evening been told—and the devil will utter truths when they promote his ends. George. Then death alone can end my misery. M. C. Death cannot deprive you of that self-love which is the source of your misery, because all loves are seated in the soul. Hope not, then, to find a friend in death, until that enemy is defeated. Learn to act as the agent of Providence, and not as if you were yourself a god. Every man who acts entirely from himself, without remembering (and continually acknowledging with the heart) from whom he derives the powers of action, makes himself a god, and commits profanation. This is that forbidden fruit which destroyed our race, and the serpent which offers it is self-love. But be persuaded to shun such impiety, and you may yet be happy. George. Happy! and Catharine in the arms of another! Never!—never! M. C. Despair is impious, because it is the annihilation of that confidence in the divine providence which Heaven commands us to cherish. Be a man, and never again lose sight of this confidence. Return to your duty—observe my counsels, and you shall yet defeat a host. If you strictly adhere to the precepts I have given you, I pledge the word of him who never lied, that where your general drives a hundred, you yourself shall put a thousand to flight; that peace shall follow your victories, and that happiness shall wait on peace. Follow my advice—or we meet no more. Before George could reply, his Mentor had disappeared. Deeply musing on a promise which appeared extravagant (if not impossible to be accomplished) our hero departed from the Battery, and repaired to his lodgings. But sleep was a stranger to his pillow, and he passed the night in meditation; the result of which was, a determination to return immediately to the army, commend Catharine to the care of Heaven, scrupulously perform his duty, and throw every care upon Providence. Having founded this resolution on a genuine basis, and applied to the proper source for assisttance in keeping it, our hero rose in the morning with an almost supernatural mental energy, and immediately commenced his journey to the frontiers, where he arrived on the fifteenth of July. Here he found a letter from O'Hara, in which the writer stated that he had, at his own request, been transferred to the squadron on Lake Champlain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXIV. SECRETS WORTH KNOWING. Words—words—words. Shakspeare. Sandford appeared no more on the eastern side of the river, after betraying Fort Niagara into the hands of the enemy. Enriched with the price of his infamy, he felt no inclination for the duties and privations of a military life, although offered a lieutenant-colonel's commission in the British service. He passed the winter at Kingston, dividing his time between Sophia and the gaming-table, and was so uniformly successful at play, that in the following spring he found himself worth eighty thousand pounds, independent of the proceeds of his New-England estates. He now began to think of retiring from business, and devoting his future hours to luxurious indolence; but to such a life, the climate of Canada was very inauspicious; and his whole attention was, for a long time, vainly employed in determining upon one more congenial to his wishes. At length, however, during an excursion to Quebec, he fell in company and soon became acquainted with the captain of a private armed schooner from one of the West-India Islands, who represented it to be an earthly Eden, and advised Sandford to proceed thither and purchase a plantation, when he could sink at once into the lap of ease, and revel in a paradise of sensual delights. This advice was so consonant to Sandford's ideas of happiness, that he immediately determined to adopt it; and finally purchased a share in the privateer, and struck a bargain with the captain to convey him to the land of promise. While the necessary preparations were making, Sandford and Sophia remained at Quebec, the latter still supporting the character of Reuben. Being one evening together in a coffee-house, Reuben pointed out to him an article in a file of newspapers which they were examining, commencing in the following manner: “Quebec, November 4, 1813. “On Friday and Saturday last, the following “American officers were conducted under an “escort of major Bell's volunteer cavalry, from “Beauport, were they were on parole, and lodged “in the jail of this city: “Major C. Van de Venter—Captains John “Machesney, Henry Fleming, Alex. M`Ewen, “&amp;c.” A few enquiries at the prison convinced Sandford that the father of Catharine was there confined; and, from that instant, he determined upon the final execution of his long meditated scheme of stabbing George through the bosom of Catharine. Sophia had declined accompanying him to the West-Indies; but, for a sufficient reward, she engaged to furnish Catharine as a substitute! As a preliminary step to the execution of this contract, Reuben repaired to the prison, and with some difficulty obtained an interview with Fleming, to whom he announced himself as a young drummer, who had just returned from imprisonment in the United States, where he had become acquainted with captain Willoughby, who had often spoken to him of his friend Fleming's captivity. He had, therefore, taken the first opportunity, on his return to Quebec, to seek him out, and exert his influence to procure his parole. During this, and a subsequent interview, it was found that Fleming had no hope of a speedy restoration to liberty; that he had just received a letter from his daughter, the substance of which he repeated; and that those he had written to his friends in the United States, had probably been suppressed, as he had never heard of their reception. With this information, Sophia was ready to commence her operations. Captain Miller was easily induced to become an agent in the plot, and for this purpose proposed to proceed with his privateer to Long-Island Sound, and there cruise under the protection of the British blockading squadron off New-London, while Sandford and Reuben were to land, and execute a plan they had digested for getting Catharine into their power. On arriving in the Sound, however, Miller agreed to become a still more active agent, and with the result of his journey to Ithaca, (accompanied by Sophia as his sister) the reader is already acquainted. The lips of Sandford received the kiss which Catharine intended for her father. The too successful villain sprang from the sofa, clasped her in his rude embrace, and for some moments held the insensible sufferer locked in his unhallowed arms, rifling her pallid lips of their sweets. It was so long before this horror-struck girl recovered from her swoon, that her relentless persecutor became alarmed for her existence, fearing that death had deprived him of his untasted prey; he therefore rung a bell so furiously that the old lady was at his elbow in a moment. “Monster!” exclaimed she, “what have you done to the poor thing? Why you have frightened her into a fit. Had you not wit enough to proceed gently?” “Silence! old hell-cat!” vociferated Sandford, in a voice of thunder, “and bring me some sal volatile, or something else to restore her breath. Stay—she recovers—Now leave the room!” The old woman obeyed in silence, while Catharine slowly opened her eyes, and threw them wildly round the room. In a moment they rested on Sandford, and with a dreadful shriek she darted towards the door, but was caught by the arm before she reached it. “Not so fast, my lovely Hibernian,” said he, rudely seizing her round the waist. “It is a long time since you and I met in private, and I have been at a damnable expense to obtain this interview. Do not imagine then that I shall very readily relinquish you.” “O mercy! mercy!” exclaimed she, falling on her knees before the inhuman monster; “Pity a poor friendless orphan, and conduct me to my dying father.” “Make yourself easy on that score,” answered he with a malicious smile; your father is alive and well in Quebec. Now reward me for my good news with another kind kiss.” “By what right, sir, do you thus presume to persecute and insult a poor unfortunate creature, who has no one near to protect her? Why have I been thus inveigled away from my friends and detained against my inclination? Oh! my poor father! why are you not permitted to protect your child!” “Be calm, lovely girl!” replied Sandford; and permit me to answer your questions by proposing a few others. Why was my hand rejected with disdain, when I once offered to make you my wife? Why was I banished from your presence in disgrace, and exposed to the vengeance of your father, for a fault which arose from an excess of love alone? Why have you represented me to your favored lover in a light so odious as forever to prevent a reconciliation between us? When you can give a satisfactory answer to these questions, I may be able to reply to yours.” “Your own conscience will answer for me,” replied Catharine, “if you will but listen to its suggestions.” “I now repeat my former propositions,” continued Sandford, “Consent to become my wife, and you shall be immediately restored to your friends, and your father shall be restored to you.” “Detested wretch!” exclaimed Catharine, with an energy and dignity which startled her inhuman persecutor—“Consent to become your wife! So help me Heaven, I will sooner perish— sooner suffer a death of ignominy, and even accompany my father to the scaffold, than so debase myself!” “Then you must be content to become my mistress,” replied Sandford coolly. “You are caught in my toils, and no power on earth can rescue you. Say, proud girl! are you content to succeed the amiable and virtuous companion of your journey from Ithaca, and occupy these arms which have been so long the cradle of Julia Miller, alias Sophia Palmer? Content you may be, for to that destiny are you fated, and this moment shall initiate you into the delicious duties appertaining to that honorable office.” Sandford immediately proceeded to put his threat in execution. Catharine shrieked loudly for help, and struggled with a strength that astonished her unfeeling assailant. Her voice was heard in the street, and the house was soon beset with watchmen, who threatened to break down the door unless they were instantly admitted. Sandford now perceived that not a moment was to be lost. Catharine had swooned, and he raised her in his arms, wrapped her in a large cloak, and conveyed her down a private flight of stairs into the back yard. Here he was joined by his friend Miller, with whose assistance he bore her down an alley which led to the river, where a barge was in waiting. When Catharine recovered from her fit, she found herself in the arms of Sandford, and within half a mile of Hurl-gate, hurried forward by a fresh westerly breeze, and eight sturdy oarsmen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXV. BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS. Again the warlike trumpet's loud alarms, Excite to virtuous acts, and manly arms; While coward Love avows his abject fear— On silken wings sublime he cuts the air, Scared at the noble noise and thunder of the war. Rowe's Tam. Our hero stedfastly adhered to his good resolutions, and suffered no consideration to divert him from the path of duty. Not long after his return to the army, a general battle took place on the peninsula, (near the mighty cataract of Niagara, and within the sound of its terrific thunders) which continued from five o'clock in the evening until near nidnight, and terminated in the defeat of the British army, although their force, including Indians, was more than double that of the Americans. The action was commenced by the gallant Scott, with less than two thousand men under his command, and continued for an hour and forty minutes before he was supported by the reserve under Brown. The British were commanded by general Drummond, seconded by general Riall, and their advance line was posted in great strength on a very commanding eminence, near Lundy's lane. A formidable battery of nine pieces of artillery (two of which were brass twenty-four pounders) occupied the summit of this eminence, supported by an extensive and heavy line of infantry. This was the key of the whole position, and gave the enemy such superior advantages, that it was determined at once to seize the artillery and occupy the height. 51 This hazardous duty was assigned to the brave colonel Miller (the hero of Maguaga) who, perfectly aware of the mortal perils attending so desperate a service, cheerfully replied to his general, “I'll try, sir,”[34] [34] See volume i, page 264. and immediately advanced with his regiment (seconded by that of the intrepid M`Farland) under a most rapid and destructive fire, which was poured down upon them from every piece of artillery, and a heavy line of musketry. M`Farland gallantly fell at the head of his regiment, and was succeeded in command by major Brooke, an officer of equal intrepidity and valor. The undaunted Miller steadily and silently ascended the eminence, followed by his eager countrymen, and after a short but bloody contest on the summit, succeeded in carrying the whole battery, drove the British down the hill, and turned the fire of their own cannon against them. In the course of half an hour, however, the enemy being strongly reinforced from Fort George, determined to return to the charge and regain his artillery. Brown was informed that his broken corps were rallied, and were advancing in good order and great force. Doubting the correctness of this information, and wishing to ascertain the truth, he immediately passed with his suite in front of the American line, and discovered by the faint light of the moon, a more extended and solid phalanx, than had yet opposed him, advancing rapidly to the charge. Captain Spencer, without saying a word, put spurs to his horse, and galloping up to the right of the advancing line, demanded in a strong and firm voice— “What regiment is that?” He was as promptly answered, “The Royal Scots, sir.” Having obtained this information, the daring Spencer rejoined his commander-in-chief, who retired with his suite behind the American line. The enemy advanced slowly and firmly, while the most perfect silence was preserved throughout the ranks of both armies. The muskets of the Americans were levelled with a deadly aim, and the ready lighted matches were suspended over the well-directed cannon. A general discharge was received from the advancing foe, and still no American trigger was pressed, until the assailants were within twenty paces of their muzzles, when the word was given to fire, and most awful and tremendous was the effect. The British sustained their ground as long, perhaps, as ever men stood such a deluge of destruction, and then retired in confusion. Three similar attempts, equally daring, desperate, and unsuccessful, were made by the exasperated enemy to regain his cannon; in each attempt he was defeated with dreadful slaughter, and finally relinquished the contest, and retired beyond the borders of the field, which was thickly strewed with the dead and wounded of both armies. The Americans being now much exhausted by fatigue, and faint for want of refreshments, retired in good order to their camp, while every possible attention was paid to the wounded of both armies. Thus terminated the best fought battle which ever took place on the American continent, in which the Americans successfully contended with more than twice their number, drove the enemy from all his positions, stormed his batteries, carried his artillery, and after keeping possession of the conquered field for three hours, retired to camp without interruption. All this was performed by moon-light, while the hostile lines were generally within twenty yards of each other, and frequently so intermingled, that officers would order an enemy's platoon. But the loss of the Americans was severe, being one hundred and seventy-one killed, five hundred and seventy-two wounded, and one hundred and seventeen missing. The British loss was eighty-four killed, five hundred and fifty-nine wounded, and two hundred and thirty-six missing, one hundred and sixty-nine of whom were taken prisoners. Among the enemy's wounded were the generals Drummond and Riall—the latter was taken prisoner by captain Ketchum of Jesup's regiment, as was also his aid. Brown was severely wounded through the thigh, and in the side. Scott, who had as usual exposed his person in the most dauntless manner, was wounded in the right shoulder, and in the left side; had two horses killed under him, and his aid, lieutenant Worth, with his brigade major, Smith, were both wounded by his side. More than thirty officers of this brigade were killed or wounded. The following officers need no eulogium on their conduct, for they all bear upon their persons the most honorable testimony of their courage and patriotism—wounds, obtained in their country's service, and which many of them will carry to their graves: colonels Brady and Dobbin; majors Leavenworth, M`Neill, Jesup, and Wood; captains Biddle, Foster, Bliss, Pentland, Foulk, Burbank, and Odell; lieutenants Campbell, Schmuck, J. D. Smith, Worth, Fowle, Browning, Fisher, Cushman, Hale, Cooper, Stephenson, Culbertson, Ferguson, Armstrong, Bean, Shaylor, M`Glassin, Giafford, Vasquez, Bissel, Cilley, Fisk, Whiting, Ingersol, Tappan, Abeal, Dietereich, Lamb, O'Fling, Dick, and Webster; ensigns Thomas, Camp, J. P. Jacobs, G. Jacobs, Blake, Bedford, Thompson, and Jones. Captain Pentland and lieutenant Webster, were made prisoners. In this affair every man did his duty, every officer was a hero; and no one was distinguishable from another, except by their good fortune in being ordered into situations of peculiar peril. Of this class were the following: generals Ripley and Porter; colonels Miller, Dobbin, Nicholas, Gardner and Wilcox, (the latter commanded the Canadian volunteers); major Jesup, Hindman, Jones, M`Ree, and Brooke; captains Austin, Spencer, Ketchum, and Towson; and lieutenant Randolph. Adjutant Poe, major M`Farland, captains Spencer, Ritchie, Hull, Kinney, Goodrich, and Hooper; lieutenants Bigelow, Turner, and Burghard; and ensign Hunter, all gloriously fell in the contest, and swell the number of those names which will ever be cherished in the remembrance of their grateful and admiring countrymen. The disabled Brown and Scott were conveyed to Buffalo, while the command of the army devolved on the gallant Ripley, until the third of August, when it was assumed by general Gaines. In the mean time, the works of Fort Erie were extended, and the original fort much strengthened. In the foregoing affair, captain Willoughby was not idle, but conducted himself with his characterestic coolness and intrepidity; as he did also during the subsequent siege of Fort Erie, which 51* commenced on the third of August, and continued until the seventeenth of September; during which period the post was assailed in the most determined manner, and defended with equal resolution—an almost unceasing cannonade being kept up between the besiegers and besieged. Captain Biddle, lieutenant Zantzinger, adjutant-lieutenant Watmough, and lieutenant Patterson, the heroes of many a desperate conflict, were wounded, among many others, by the shot and shells thrown from the enemy's works. On the morning of the fifteenth of August, the British made a furious attempt to carry the place by storm; and for this purpose attacked it at three points in the same moment, their centre column being led by lieutenant-colonel Drummond. The attack was expected by Gaines; who, not knowing at what points it would be made, prepared to receive it at every one which was thought assailable. The night was dark and rainy, but the faithful sentinel slept not, and one third of the American troops were at their posts. At half past two o'clock the approach of the enemy was distinctly heard; and a most tremendous fire of cannon and small arms immediately opened upon him. Three times did he attempt to mount the walls with scaling-ladders, and was as often thrown back by the destructive tempest that was poured upon him from the flaming batteries. After the third repulse, Drummond took advantage of the extreme darkness of the morning, (which concealed all his movements from the view of the garrison) and silently moved his remaining troops to an unexpected point, where he repeated the charge. He ascended the scaling-ladder in the midst of his men, who mounted with such velocity as to gain footing on the parapet before any effectual opposition could be made. Here they were ordered to charge with pikes and bayonets and give no quarter! Captains Williams and Willoughby, with the brave lieutenants M`Donough and Watmough, fought arm to arm with the assailants, and were all severely wounded—the gallant Williams, mortally. M`Donough's wounds soon rendered him unable to resist, when Willoughby threw himself before him, and deeply dyed the sword of Washington in the blood of his enemies, whom he kept at bay until the blade snapped in twain, when he received a cut on his head which threw him on his wounded friend M`Donough, who now reluctantly demanded quarter. “Give no quarter!” exclaimed the tiger-hearted Drummond, and darted forward to stab the fallen suppliant; who, seizing a handspike, successfully defended himself against a numerous party that now rushed upon him, until a pistol-shot from the hand of Drummond terminated his existence. Our hero had now recovered himself, and regained his footing on the slippery platform, running with blood, when seeing the fate of his friend, he drew forth a pistol and shot his inhuman assassin through the heart, and then effected his retreat from the bastion. The day now began to dawn, and never before did it rise upon such a scene of human carnage as this devoted bastion now exhibited. The contest still continued with augmented fury, and several desperate but unsuccessful charges were made on the assailants by the Americans, led on by the undaunted Birdsall, who was severely wounded, and compelled to give back, while the gallant Hindman, Hall and Foster, charged at different points, with no better success. A most tremendous assault was, however, just on the point of being made by four hundred Americans, who were resolved to turn the tide of victory, or perish in the attempt, when a dreadful explosion took place beneath the platform of the contested bastion, which destroyed nearly all the British who occupied it, and at once decided the fate of the conflict. The enemy were now in a few moments entirely defeated, taken, or put to flight, leaving on the field two hundred and twenty-one killed, one hundred and seventy-four wounded, and one hundred and eighty-six prisoners. Fourteen officers were among the killed, and seven among the prisoners. The American loss in this affair, was seventeen killed, fifty-six wounded, and eleven missing. Among the killed, were the brave captain Williams and lieutenant M`Donough. Lieutenant Watmough defended the contested bastion until his wounds rendered him incapable of further resistance; while the gallant Fontaine was thrown from the walls, and fell into the hands of the Indians, who, unlike their white allies, did not refuse quarter to a wounded and yielding foe. Lieutenants Belknap, Brown, and Bushnell, and ensign Cisna, were also severely wounded while gallantly contending with the enemy. Besides those already mentioned, the following officers bore a conspicuous part in this desperate contest, and made a brilliant display of that chivalric spirit which so eminently characterises the American soldier, viz. Generals Ripley and Porter; colonel Aspinwall; majors Trimble, Hindman, Wood, M`Kee, Hall, and Jones; captains Seymour, Towson, Chunn, Biddle, Fanning, Foster, Boughton, Harding, Birdsall, Marston, Ropes, and Harris; lieutenants Fraser, Gleason, Jewitt, Larned, Bowman, Byrd, Riddle, Hall, Zantzinger, Childs, Douglas, Cushman, Foot, and Belton; ensigns Benn, Jones, Cummings, Thomas, Keally, Green, and Blake. Soon after the above affair, general Brown was so far recovered of his wounds as to repair to Fort Erie, and resume the command of the army, which had been, in the mean time, reinforced by new levies of militia. He immediately conceived a plan for dislodging the enemy from his intrenched works, and communicated it in the strictest confidence to the officers of his staff, who gave it their most cordial approbation. Fraser and Riddle, being well acquainted with the intervening woods, were consulted on the subject of opening a road through them, by which the works of the enemy might be assailed from an unexpected point, and they readily undertook to open such road in a direction hitherto deemed the most inaccessible. Accordingly, on the morning of the sixteenth of September, they proceeded from Fort Erie with a fatigue party, and penetrated the woods which surrounded the enemy's encampment, until they arrived within pistol-shot of his works. Here they determined to commence their operations, and cut their way back towards the fort. A messenger was immediately dispatched to inform Brown, that the party were in readiness to begin, when a brisk cannonade was opened upon the enemy's works, in order to drown the sounds of the American axes, while the whole party fell to work in felling trees and filling morasses. In the course of the day, a convenient road was constructed, concealed from the enemy's view only by a little thicket in front of his third battery; and through this road, on the following day, did Fraser and Riddle lead the advance of the assailing columns, with so much rapidity and secrecy, that the sentinel who was walking to and fro in the area in front of the battery, was surprised and slain before any alarm was given, and the battery was instantly stormed in the most gallant manner, and the cannon spiked. Had the attention of the enemy been at all directed to a point so admirably defended by nature, the wary assailants might still have anproached unobserved; for a stratagem was adopted by their advance similar to that recorded by Shakspeare of Macduff, in his march against the tyrant of Scotland. Independent of a dress corresponding to the color of the foliage through which they proceeded, each man was so enveloped by branches stuck in his belt and other parts of his body, that no semblance of a human being could have been traced; and the astonished foe might have thought, like Macbeth, that a forest was marching against him. The assault was made at two points, by two divisions of the American forces—one of them commanded by Porter, and the other by Miller; and with so much bravery and address was the whole executed, that the British batteries were all carried, one of his magazines blown up, his cannon spiked, and above one thousand of his troops either captured, killed, or desperately wounded. The Americans lost eighty killed, two hundred and fourteen wounded, and two hundred and sixteen missing, which latter were principally militia who lost their way in the woods, and were captured after the regulars had returned in triumph to the fort. The severity of our hero's recent wounds prevented his sharing in the glory of this enterprise. During this brilliant sortie, the following valuable officers fell, while galiantly leading their men to the charge; but their names and examples will live to guide the soldier in the path of duty, so long as true heroism is held in estimation: General Davis, colonel Gibson, and lieutenant-colonel Wood; captains Buel, Bradford, Hale, and Armistead; ensigns O`Fling, Blakesley, Brown, and Belknap. The following heroes survived the contest, but their blood has consecrated the soil on which that conflict was sustained, and enriched it for the growth of Freedom—viz. Generals Ripley and Porter; lieutenant-colonel Aspinwall; major Trimble; captains Ingersol, Knapp, Gillet, Hale, Cobb, Ramsey, and Bigger, (the latter of the Canadian volunteers); lieutenants Bailey, Grant, Stephenson, Clark, Hale, Brown, Childs, and Crawford; ensigns Cummings and Neely. The ever gallant Fraser, (who was Porter's brigade-major,) received a shot in the leg, while spiking one of the enemy's cannon, and his friend Delapierre, [35] [35] In commemoration of this brilliant achievement, Miller's regiment afterwards wore this motto on their buttons—I'll try, sir. who was a volunteer aid to the general, was also severely wounded. The brave Riddle, with quarter-master Greene, of the volunteers, as soon as the first battery was carried, descended into the enemy's magazine, and after securing a quantity of fixed ammunition, blew up the magazine, and suffered severely from the explosion. The patriotic conduct of major Hubbard, with that of fourteen men exempted by age from military duty, who voluntarily served under him on this occasion, will long be remembered by their grateful country; while the bravery and patriotism of twenty young gentlemen who volunteered from Batavia, and followed captain Elliott in this hazardous enterprize, will excite an irresistible glow of emulation in the bosom of every youthful soldier. But it is impossible to do justice to all who signalized themselves on this occasion; it is sufficient that I record the names of all that can be collected, for it will one day be the proudest boast of many a father to his son, while opening his tender mind to the sentiments of patriotism and honor, to conclude his lesson with—“Your father was in the sortie from Erie;” and he will then mention with enthusiasm the names I have already recorded, to which he will add those of Miller, Ripley, Snelling, Gardner, Beedle, M`Donald, Upham, M`Bee, Dobbin, M`Burney, Fleming, Hopkins, Churchill, Crosby, Hall, Jones, Brook, Chambers, Austen, Lee, Marcle, Wilson, Lawrence, Burr, Dunham, Kellogg, Ganson, Shortridge, Ballard, Dobbins, Bates, and Robinson— all of a rank superior to captain. Also, captains Hull, Simms, Bradford, Fleming, Parker, Chatfield, Richardson, and Kennedy; together with lieutenants Lee, Goodall, Ingersol, Livingston, Bissell, Armstrong, Shore, Kirby, Bridnot, Watts, Holding, and Davis; and ensign Brant. On the third day after this brilliant sortie, the enemy raised the siege, broke up his encampment, hastily retreated towards Fort George, and rested under the protection of its cannon. Our hero was still confined with the wounds he received in the assault of the fifteenth, when the following letter was handed him from O'Hara: “U. S. Ship Saratoga, “Plattsburgh Bay, Sept. 13, 1814. “It is my good fortune, my dear sir, to announce that I have for the second time, witnessed the glorious sight of a whole British fleet surrendering to the superior skill and bravery of American seamen. Our gallant commodore, M`Donough, will now vie with Perry, while the name of M`Comb will be coupled with those of Harrison, Brown, Scott, Boyd, Ripley, Porter, &amp;c. The eleventh of September will also shine as bright on the page of history, as the tenth. But I will descend to particulars. “The enemy, for some time past, has exhibited a disposition to invade the state of New-York, by the way of Champlain and Plattsburgh; and, on the first instant, actually entered the former place with an immense army of veterans (the most of whom had immortalized themselves in Spain and France, under lord Wellington) led forward, in great style, by Prevost and De Rottenberg. From Champlain they made gradual approaches towards Plattsburgh, where M`Comb commanded 52 a small remnant of the right wing of the American army—the main body, under Izard, having been previously ordered to Sacket's Harbor. “On arriving in the vicinity of Plattsburgh, in full view of the unfinished and half-garrisoned fortifications of the Americans, the enemy made a pause, and spent five days in throwing up breastworks for the protection of his approaches. “All this time, our flotilla lay opposite Plattsburgh; but had Prevost pushed immediately forward, all our exertions could not have saved M`Comb's little army from destruction. Prevost, however, was studying a deeper game—considering that the defeat of this handful of men under M`Comb as an object of comparative insignificance, he wished to include our squadron in the victory, and therefore waited all this time for the British fleet to come up and capture us, while he conquered the army. “Well, sir—on Sunday, the eleventh instant, the British fleet did come up, and instantly gave us battle; while, at the same moment, Prevost gave battle to M`Comb, on shore. The result was, that victory crowned the American arms in both contests; the whole British fleet is ours, and the whole British army (or as many as could effect their escape) retreated in confusion, leaving their sick and wounded to the mercy of the victors, and destroying their stores to facilitate their flight. “Our squadron carried eighty-six guns, and the British ninety-five. We had fifty-two killed, and fifty-eight wounded; while they had eighty-four killed, (including their commodore, Downie) and one hundred and ten wounded. “The British army, on shore, was fourteen thousand strong, composed of veterans; while that of the Americans consisted of fifteen hundred regulars, and less than three thousand raw and undisciplined militia. The former have lost, in killed, wounded and missing, about two thousand five hundred; while the Americans, during the whole siege, have only lost thirty-seven killed, sixty-two wounded, and twenty missing. “Insert the following names on your journal, for they all deserve to be recorded in letters of gold on columns of marble, for their heroic conduct in contending against and defeating the boasted invincibles of Lord Wellington:—Generals Mooers and Wright, of the New-York militia; colonels Smith, Appling, and Miller; majors Wooll and Totten; captain M`Glassin, Sproull, Brooks, Vaughan, Scoville, Grosvenor, and Youngs—(the latter commanded a small detachment of infantry on board the squadron, acting as marines); lieutenants Root, De Russy, Trescott, Smyth, Mountford, Cromwell, Sumpter, Harrison, Turner, Taylor, and Runk. The four last were wounded—Runk mortally. “Captain M`Glassin had covered himself with glory two days previous to the battle. With a small detachment, he forded, at midnight, the river which separated the two armies, and attacked a party of the enemy who were constructing a strong battery that would have proved very destructive to the American ranks; he defeated them with great loss, destroyed the battery, spiked the cannon, and then returned in safety to the American camp. “On board the squadron, we lost two brave and valuable officers—lieutenants Gamble and Stansbury; the latter was knocked overboard and drowned. Your friend John H. Graham, who immortalized himself in storming the British batteries opposite Black Rock, where he lost a leg, was very active on this glorious occasion; and so was another young hero, whose name I have often heard mentioned with admiration—I mean Nathaniel Lawrence Montgomery, (cousin to the immortal Lawrence whose name he bears) who lost a hand on board the frigate President during her running fight with the Belvidere.[36] [36] The following certificate from the gallant Porter, presented to this patriotic young gentleman when the latter was about to sail for Europe, is with pleasure recorded in this place: “Towards the close of the siege of Fort Erie, in September, 1814, Mr. Delapierre visited the American camp, and remained several days during that critical period, assisting and encouraging the garrison in the discharge of its arduous duties At the sortie, on the 17th of September, which terminated the siege, he tendered his services to me as volunteer aid-de-camp, and acquitted himself with great gallantry on that occasion, and received a severe wound. So rare an instance of patriotism and bravery, entitles this young gentleman to the respect and consideration of every friend to his country. “New-York, July 6, 1815. P. B. PORTER.” On the present occasion, he volunteered his services to M`Donough, and was very conspicuous for his intelligence, activity, and courage. “Besides those I have already mentioned, the following naval officers also distinguished themselves on the glorious ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER; viz. Lieutenants Cassin, Valette, and Duncan— the latter was serving on shore, where he lost an arm by a rocket; also, midshipmen Monteath, Williamson, Platt, Thwing, and Baldwin. Montgomery received three trifling wounds. “As I concluded the account of Perry's victory with an anecdote of a dog, I will conclude that of M`Donough with an anecdote of a game-cock, which was on board this ship, the property of your friend Graham. In the hottest of the battle, this noble bird flew up the fore hatchway, and lighted on the ship's bell, where he continued to crow with all his might, until a cannon ball broke the bell to pieces. He then flew up into the rigging, and continued crowing until the action ceased. This incident was hailed by the sailors as an omen of success, and since the event has verified it, the bird is almost worshipped throughout the squadron. A man might as safely kill one of the sacred animals of the Hindoos, as to harm Graham's game-cock—an attempt of the kind would almost raise a mutiny in the fleet. “Have you heard any thing further respecting Fleming's detention at Quebec, and dare they try him for treason? Write soon, and tell me something of my niece. Adieu. “WILLIAM O'HARA.” After the enemy had been compelled to raise the siege of Fort Erie, nothing material occurred during the remainder of the campaign, except an affair which took place at Lyon's Creek, between a detachment of nine hundred Americans, under general Bissell, and eleven hundred British, under the marquis of Tweedale, in which the latter were defeated and driven into their intrenchments, with a loss of nearly two hundred, in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The American loss was only twelve killed, and fifty-five wounded. The action took place on the nineteenth of October; captain Willoughby was engaged in it, and with so much courage and address as to excite the admiration of his brethren in arms. The other officers who distinguished themselves on this occasion, were—Colonels Pinkney, Snelling, and Pearce; majors Barnard, Barker, and Grindage; captains Dorman, Irvine, and Allison; lieutenants Horreil, Gassaway, Prestman, and Anspack. On the fifth of November, according to previous arrangements, Fort Erie was destroyed, and the American army went into winter-quarters on the eastern side of the Niagara.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">52* CHAPTER LXVI. LIGHT FROM THE SOUTH. A better order of succeeding days Comes smiling forward, white and lucky all. Rowe's Fair Penitent. On the fourteenth of November, captain Willoughby received a letter from Mrs. Woodcock, enclosing another, which she had just received from her son, at New-Orleans. For the reader's gratification, I shall here insert both of them. That from the mother commenced as follows: “Ithaca, November 10, 1814. “Heaven be praised for all its mercies! Catharine is safe! Yes, my dear sir, my poor niece is alive—well—among friends—uninjured—happy, as she can be while separated from us. The inclosed will tell you all—it is from my son, who is in New-Orleans, where he has just taken a wife. Read it, and then join with me in adoring that Being whose `judgments are unsearchable, and whose ways are past finding out.' “I will not attempt to describe the unhappiness I have suffered since Catharine's mysterious disappearance; combined with my disorder, it has almost reduced me to the grave; and you may form some idea of it from your own feelings. The astonishment of your father when he heard of it was only equalled by his sorrow. “Please return the inclosed, when you have read it, and believe me to be, yours respectfully, &amp;c. “CATHARINE WOODCOCK.” [INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.] “New-Orleans, October 4, 1814. “Be happy, my dear mother, for I have good news to communicate. Our cousin Catharine Fleming is safe under my protection—the same innocent happy being, as when we were romping together at Ithaca. Pause, while you freely indulge the rapturous tears of joy, and then proceed to particulars. “On the eleventh of September, commodore Patterson, of the American flotilla on this station, sailed with a small squadron on an expedition against a gang of pirates, who have long occupied an island in lake Barrataria, about thirty miles from this city, and committed great depredations on the coast—capturing the vessels of all nations indiscriminately, and murdering the crews and passengers. Several vessels from this port, which were supposed to have been lost at sea, have increased the booty of these outlawed wretches. A detachment of eighty men, under colonel Ross, also, went down by land, to make a simultaneous attack, with the squadron, on the rendezvous of these unprincipled freebooters. “You may perhaps be ignorant that such a fraternity ever existed in civilized America. But such is the fact, and in the course of this letter I shall have occasion to give a brief history of its leader. Let it suffice, for the present, that the expedition against them was successful—their strong hold was taken, together with all their armed schooners and feluccas, and a great quantity of booty. The captain of this banditti, monsieur La Fitte, effected his escape; but Dominique, the second in command, with about one thousand of his band, were taken prisoners. “On Saturday last, the first instant, I stood on the levee, with many of the joyful citizens, to welcome the victorious Patterson and Ross, on their return from the successful enterprise; when the unexpected sight of an elegant female, leaning on the arm of the colonel, attracted the attention of every spectator. My curiosity was excited, and I advanced—when Catharine sprang forward— uttered my name with a shriek—and fainted in my arms. “The narrow limits of a letter will not allow me to detail all the particulars of this happy meeting—the exclamations—sensations—agitations— interrogations—explanations—congratulations— with my tender bride's commiserations—all these things must be deferred for verbal communications. In the mean time, however, I will give you a brief recital of our cousin's peregrinations, since she parted from you—at least, as far as the agitated state of her mind has permitted her to relate them. “Instead of being conveyed to her sick father, as she expected to be, she was most treacherously betrayed into the power of a wretch who has, at length, expiated his crimes by death. Her father was still a prisoner in Quebec, and the companions of her journey were the base minions of that villainous Sandford who once pretended to have saved her life at Richmond, and afterwards insulted her with dishonorable proposals. While she was fainting with terror, he bore her on board an English privateer, of which he boasted of being part owner, having deserted from the American army, and espoused the British cause. “To what part of the world he intended to convey her, Catharine could never understand. as the greater part of the time she was on board the privateer, she was suffering under a raging fever, accompanied with fits of raving delirium, during which she would suffer no one to approach her but a black boy who waited on the captain. However severe this additional calamity may seem, it was probably permitted by Heaven to secure her from the insults of her abandoned persecutor. “On the fifth of August, at about ten o'clock in the morning, a thick fog, which had hung about them for more than two days, suddenly broke away, when they discovered two armed vessels, under American colors, within musket shot. To escape was impossible, and the privateer was therefore cleared for action. A desperate and sanguinary conflict now took place, which continued above three hours, when captain Miller and his first lieutenant being both slain, the next officer ordered the British flag to be struck, and surrendered the privateer as a prize to the two hostile schooners. She was immediately boarded from both, and the cowardly Sandford, having now crawled upon deck, tendered his sword to the ferocious-looking officer who headed the boarders. The weapon was received, and instantly thrust through the wretched prisoner's heart, who fell lifeless on the deck. This was the signal for an indiscriminate slaughter, and every man belonging to the privateer soon floated a breathless corpse in the deep. The black boy alone escaped, who concealed himself in the hold, and on being discovered after the massacre, was permitted to live. “Fortunately for Catharine, she was insensible to all these dreadful transactions, and learned them afterwards from the boy. On recovering her recollection, she found herself in bed on shore, with a black woman and the boy watching by her pillow, who both testified the most lively joy, on hearing her speak in a calm and rational manner. Her fever was now broken, but she was extremely weak, and it was several days before her physician, who was also black, would allow her to converse, although she was laboring with the most painful curiosity to learn the particulars of her situation. At length, however, her nurse was permitted to answer her eager inquiries, who informed her, with the greatest caution, that she was on an island called Barrataria, which was occupied by a band of outlaws, who had declared war against a world that had discarded them, and lived by committing depredations on the property of every nation without distinction. In a word, Catharine found herself a prisoner among a band of the most daring pirates that ever infested the ocean;—who, within thirty miles of New-Orleans, were in the habit of capturing vessels, bound to and from that port, and murdering every person on board, to prevent a discovery. “Disagreeable as this information was to Catharine, it was not so dreadful as her compassionate attendants had apprehended. She was out of the power of Sandford, and every other situation was comparatively happy. Besides, should her health be restored, she did not despair of prevailing on the chief to send her to New-Orleans, as he was represented to her as a paragon of generosity and magnanimity—a second Charles de Moor. “Catharine's health gradually returned, and she had so far recovered her strength as to be able to walk, when she was one day honored with a visit from Monsieur La Fitte himself; who, after politely congratulating her on the partial restoration of her health, begged her to inform him in what manner he could serve her. “By conveying, or sending me to New-Orleans,” was Catharine's reply. “Were such a step compatible with my own safety,” answered he, “I would not hesitate a moment. But, madam, consider what a risk I should incur by such a step. A price is set upon my head by the governor of Louisiana, and several fruitless attempts have already been made to earn the reward; therefore am I obliged, in self-defence, to destroy instead of preserving my prisoners. Do your friends reside in New-Orleans? “Alas! no, sir—they are far distant. But if I can once breathe my sorrowful story to a christian ear, I shall find protection until I can write to my friends, who must be wretched at my mysterious disappearance.” “Mysterious disappearance?” said La Fitte; “Although my mode of life, madam, is not such as can command a christian's confidence, still, if you will consent to entrust your sorrowful story to my ear, I pledge you the word of a soldier that you shall never repent the condescension.” “Catharine was willing to conciliate the being in whose power she had been so providentially placed, and therefore complied with his request, and related all the particulars which were necessary to make him acquainted with the nature of her extraordinary and forlorn situation. When she had finished, La Fitte exclaimed--- “Who shall say, then, that we are not the legal ministers of Heaven's eternal justice! My hand slew the scoundrel you describe, and avenged the load of wrongs he has heaped upon you. I now pledge myself that you shall be conveyed in safety to New-Orleans the first favorable opportunity. In the mean time rest confident of my protection, and the respectful attentions of all whom I command. I will now repay your confidence by relating some particulars respecting my own history, and that of our fraternity, with which the world are little acquainted. “I once held a commission under Bonaparte, in whose victorious army I was a captain of no inconsiderable reputation; and, but for one unfortunate circumstance, should probably have arisen to an elevated grade. The circumstance to which I allude will not interest you, and I shall therefore pass it over in silence. Let it suffice that I felt myself injured, and consequently resigned my commission and emigrated to America. I landed in this country with a proud spirit, and no adequate funds to support my dignity. Being an expert swordsman, I opened a fencing school in New-Orleans, for a livelihood, and acquired considerable celebrity in the profession. “During the troubles in St. Domingo, a vast number of the inhabitants took refuge in Cuba; and when the late war between France and Spain commenced, they were compelled to leave that island, with the short notice of a few days. Without ceremony they entered the United States, and most of them the state of Louisiana, with all the slaves they had possessed in Cuba. They were notified by the governor of this state of the clause in the constitution which forbade the importation of slaves; but at the same time, received the assurance of his excellency that he would obtain, if possible, the approbation of the general government for their retaining this property. “I will not weary your patience with particulars. I was not born for the dull pursuits of civil life—my soul always aspired to lead an army, but fate had forever blasted my hopes of military glory. My fellow-beings had treated me with ingratitude and indignity, and I now declared war against the whole despicable race. Sufficient materials were at hand for the execution of my scheme. Those very emigrants who had been hospitably received by the citizens, and highly favored by the government of their adopted country, repaid this kindness by the blackest ingratitude, which convinced me that they were sufficiently base for my purpose. I soon collected a numerous band, and in 1811, strongly fortified this island, which is as remarkable for its health and fertility as for the delicious fish with which its waters abound. I have continued here ever since, with a formidable squadron at my command, which has more than once compelled the United States flotilla to retreat; I have, also, a large military force, and have dealt out large measures of vengeance against the perfidious race whose base ingratitude drove me to this extremity. The strictest subordination exists in the island, both among my military and naval subjects, who all fear me for my courage, and love me for the liberality with which I relinquish to them my share of the booty we capture. The prince regent of 53 England cannot boast the same, or he would have fewer enemies among his own subjects. “About a year ago, the governor of Louisiana advertised a reward of five hundred dollars for my head, which pitiful offer I immediately answered by promising a reward of as many thousands for the head of his excellency, and my advertisements were posted on every corner in the city of New-Orleans. A company (commanded by a man who had once been my intimate friend) was ordered out to attack me here on my island, and was suffered to approach very near before I chose to make a display of our forces; when, on a signal given, he instantly found himself surrounded by a numerous host of armed men, who suddenly emerged from the secret avenues which lead into this bayou. And in what manner do you imagine that I treated this man, who came to destroy my life and all that makes life desirable to me? I treated him, madam, as became La Fitte, the Great Bandit of Barrataria—I spared his life— offered him that which would have made the honest soldier comfortable for the remainder of his days, (which was nobly and indignantly refused) and I then permitted him to return, with his company, in safety to the city. “His excellency was now convinced that we were too strong to be taken by land, and my navy has hitherto been larger than that which the government has kept on this station.” “After again assuring Catharine of his protection, and promising to find her a conveyance to this city, the generous pirate took his leave. It was but a few weeks after this conference, that his boasted army and navy were all captured by the gallant Patterson and Ross. “And now, my dear mother, adieu for the present. Your lovely daughter-in-law desires to be remembered with affection, and you may expect to embrace us all by the first of February. “D. WOODCOCK.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">[INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.] “New-Orleans, October 4, 1814. “Be happy, my dear mother, for I have good news to communicate. Our cousin Catharine Fleming is safe under my protection—the same innocent happy being, as when we were romping together at Ithaca. Pause, while you freely indulge the rapturous tears of joy, and then proceed to particulars. “On the eleventh of September, commodore Patterson, of the American flotilla on this station, sailed with a small squadron on an expedition against a gang of pirates, who have long occupied an island in lake Barrataria, about thirty miles from this city, and committed great depredations on the coast—capturing the vessels of all nations indiscriminately, and murdering the crews and passengers. Several vessels from this port, which were supposed to have been lost at sea, have increased the booty of these outlawed wretches. A detachment of eighty men, under colonel Ross, also, went down by land, to make a simultaneous attack, with the squadron, on the rendezvous of these unprincipled freebooters. “You may perhaps be ignorant that such a fraternity ever existed in civilized America. But such is the fact, and in the course of this letter I shall have occasion to give a brief history of its leader. Let it suffice, for the present, that the expedition against them was successful—their strong hold was taken, together with all their armed schooners and feluccas, and a great quantity of booty. The captain of this banditti, monsieur La Fitte, effected his escape; but Dominique, the second in command, with about one thousand of his band, were taken prisoners. “On Saturday last, the first instant, I stood on the levee, with many of the joyful citizens, to welcome the victorious Patterson and Ross, on their return from the successful enterprise; when the unexpected sight of an elegant female, leaning on the arm of the colonel, attracted the attention of every spectator. My curiosity was excited, and I advanced—when Catharine sprang forward— uttered my name with a shriek—and fainted in my arms. “The narrow limits of a letter will not allow me to detail all the particulars of this happy meeting—the exclamations—sensations—agitations— interrogations—explanations—congratulations— with my tender bride's commiserations—all these things must be deferred for verbal communications. In the mean time, however, I will give you a brief recital of our cousin's peregrinations, since she parted from you—at least, as far as the agitated state of her mind has permitted her to relate them. “Instead of being conveyed to her sick father, as she expected to be, she was most treacherously betrayed into the power of a wretch who has, at length, expiated his crimes by death.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXVII. THE CONCLUSION. Now have the happy lovers met, Now Fate to Virtue pays her debt; And, for their troubles, bids them prove A lengthened life of peace and love. Scott—altered. The northern army was now idle, in winter-quarters, and a furlough, at this time, could not interfere with our hero's duty. He found no difficulty in obtaining one, and set out immediately for New-Orleans, where he arrived about the middle of December, and once more met the happy Catharine. The inhabitants of New-Orleans were in a state of alarm and consternation, being in almost daily expectation of the arrival of a formidable expedition, which had been fitted out by the British for the express and avowed purpose of reducing that city, and taking possession of the whole territory of Louisiana. In consequence of this impending danger, the city was declared to be under strict martial law, by general Jackson, who was busily employed in making arrangements for its defence. On the eighteenth, he reviewed the militia of the city, which were in a few days joined by about four thousand Tennessee and Kentucky troops, detachments of which were immediately posted in different directions to guard the defences of the city. Our hero now volunteered his services to Jackson, in any capacity the general preferred, who thereupon appointed him one of his aids. Commodore Patterson dispatched five gunboats, under lieutenant Jones, to a favorable position for watching the approach of the enemy, who at length made his appearance, and after a desperate conflict, succeeded in capturing this flotilla. The hostile squadron consisted of sixty sail, mostly of the line, on board of which was an army of sixteen thousand regular troops, under the command of Sir Edward Pakenham, brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington. As soon as his advance had captured the American flotilla, the enemy landed a division of five thousand men, under major-general Keane, some miles below the city, whose progress, however, was speedily and effectually checked by about two thousand backwoodsmen and city militia. After this action, both armies continued to throw up works, with little interruption, until the twenty-eighth, when Pakenham, having landed the reserve of his army, commenced throwing bombs and rockets in a most vigorous and tremendous style, at the same time gradually advancing towards the American line. He was at length, however, compelled to retreat to his works with great loss. On the first of January, he made a similar attack with no better success. Early on the morning of the eighth, Pakenham led forward twelve thousand regulars and two thousand seamen, who approached the American works in two columns, under Generals Gibbs and Keane, supported by a reserve, under general Lambert. They advanced in the most determined manner, against a destructive fire, with scaling ladders and fascines, determined to storm Jackson's unfinished batteries, and push forward to the city. But the American fire was too hot— it swept them from right to left, and compelled them to recoil in confusion. The most active efforts were immediately made to rally the disordered columns, and bring them up to a second charge; in this act Pakenham was killed; and though Gibbs and Keane succeeded in pushing their divisions forward, the second effort was no more fortunate than the first. Gibbs and Keane were both severely wounded, the former mortally; and the only general officer left on the field was Lambert, who, after vainly attempting to rally the attacking columns, succeeded in withdrawing them from the field, and before the eighteenth the expedition was abandoned, and the whole army had evacuated the shore. Jackson was now hailed as the saviour of the city; and the distinguished part which our hero took in this brilliant defence, drew upon himself also no small share of public honor and applause. The following officers also immortalized their names by their conduct on this occasion: Generals Coffee, Carrol, Adair, Morgan, Villere, Humbert, and De Flanjac; colonels Anderson, Perry, Haynes, Butler, Ross, M`Rea, Savary, and De Laronda; majors Hinds, Planche, Dagwin, Pierre, Catard, Kevanaugh, La Tour, Carmac, Peyre, St. Geme, La Coste, Daquin, Chotard, Davis, Hampton, and Tatum; captains Reid, Baker, Humphrey,Beal,Ogden, Livingston, 53* M`Mahan, Pace, Lefevre, Planchard, Smith, and Griffin; lieutenants Spotts, Kerr, Alexis, Cromford, and Leach; also, the generals' aid Willoughby, Livingston, Duplissis, Davizac, De Castra, Duncan, Butler, and Grymes; together with doctors Kerr and Flood, and Messrs. Cheanveau, Hiriart, La Trobe, Gilbert, Bosquet, Decoin, and the Mexican field-marshal Don Juan de Anavar. General Villere's son first gave information of the enemy's landing, and was afterwards made prisoner. Colonels Platt, Dyer, Gibson, Elliott, and Lauderdale, were wounded—the latter mortally. Major Nicks and lieutenant Dupuy, were also wounded, and major Kavenaugh was made prisoner. Of the flotilla, the following officers distinguished themselves: Commodore Patterson, captain Henley, lieutenants C. C. B. Thompson, Norris, Crowlie, and Grawlie; sailing-master Johnson, master's-mate Livingston, and Midshipman Watkins; also purser Shields, and a Mr. Walker. Previous to the battle of the eighth, the pirates of Barrataria, who had been held in custody, were released by order of general Jackson, upon condition that they would assist in defending the city. In this battle they proved themselves excellent artillerists, and were very serviceable, particularly two of their naval captains—Dominique and Belluche. They all afterwards received a full pardon from the president of the United States, for their good conduct on this occasion. To their wounded enemies, the citizens of New-Orleans paid every possible attention; in which duty the nuns of the Urseline convent took the glorious lead. Under the immediate superintendance of the Abbe Douburg, they threw open their doors, and converted all their houses, except the main building, into hospitals, where the charitable sisters, at their own expense and with their own hands, took care of the sick and wounded. The ladies of New-Orleans were also employed in the same godlike acts of benevolence, in which Catharine and her lovely new cousin, liberally assisted. In a few days after this brilliant affair, our hero, Catharine, young Woodcock, and his blushing bride, set out for New-York, where they arrived on the twentieth of February. Here he met his father, Fleming, and Fleming's agent, Dobson, who had just returned from the East Indies, with an immense fortune, and made ample restitution to the man he had defrauded. George led his Catharine to the Altar of Hymen, on the very day that the ratification of the treaty of PEACE was celebrated in the city of New-York. The new married couple then accompanied their cousin Woodcock and his bride to Ithaca, where they arrived in season to receive the blessing of his dying mother. As soon as the funeral obsequies were over, George, Catharine, and Fleming, accompanied major Willoughby to Boston, where they passed the remainder of the winter and the following spring; enjoying, in the society of their friends, the purest felicity that mortals ever tasted on earth. The next summer the two fathers returned to their estates in Ohio, which were soon restored to their former beauty; and there, with our hero and his Catharine, they both still reside, ever ready to give the reader a cordial welcome, whenever he or she will make a journey to Mulberry-Grove. Sophia shone a few months in the circles of vice, and in the following winter fell a victim to disease. She ended her wretched existence in the New-York Hospital, invoking curses on herself and all mankind. Her unfortunate husband had died of a broken heart, shortly after her elopement. Our hero's Boston friends are all still living, prosperous and happy—Morse and Orville have each of them a son and a daughter. O'Hara is now sailing-master in the navy, and the achievements of Logan are celebrated by the Bards of the Forest. Woodcock and his lovely wife, are enjoying in Ithaca all the happiness that their virtues merit. Our hero had now completed his Journal of the War, and as I have promised my readers another extract, I will here insert it. July 7. Captain Porter arrived at New-York, from his long cruise in the South Seas—returns a prisoner on parole.

Thus terminated a war which has kindled a halo of glory around the American name that dazzles the eyes of admiring Europe. As George recorded the last sentence, he raised his eyes in extacy, and discovered the Mysterious Chief at his elbow, who thus accosted him: “You have at length become all I can wish— you have adhered to my precepts, and defeated a host of internal foes that were more dangerous to your peace than the British were to your country. You have conquered the former, by the assistance of Heaven—the latter were defeated by me, as the instrument of Heaven.” George. By you! M. C. Yes, by me. George. What then am I to think of you? M. C. Think of me as an ALLEGORY— and let it be recorded in your journal, that it is the duty of every parent to believe that his children are specially destined by Heaven for a life of peculiar usefulness—in order that he may be thereby induced to prepare them for such a life. I repeat—that, as the instrument of Heaven, I achieved every victory which graces your Journal; because (let it be recorded) whenever Americans would succeed, either in peace or war, their counsels must be actuated and their heroes inspired by the—Spirit of Washington.
