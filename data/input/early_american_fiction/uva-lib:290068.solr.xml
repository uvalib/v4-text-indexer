      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. 2 CLINTON BRADSHAW. CHAPTER I. Old Mr. Bradshaw, intended having a survey made of the boundaries of the Purchase, as one of his neighbours, who was a testy, litigious character, seemed anxious to create a dispute on the subject, alleging that Mr. Bradshaw's fence encroached considerably on his property. Clinton had promised his father that he would attend the survey, and the day after the incidents recorded in the last chapter, the old gentleman entered his son's office, and told him the surveyers and neighbours were to meet that day at the Purchase, and he had come in for him. “I must see Mr. Shaffer first, father,” said Bradshaw, “concerning a case that may come up in the criminal court, as the grand jury have met.” “I will wait here, then, till you return, my son. Neighbour Styles talks a great deal touching that boundary line; and I wish you to attend.” Bradshaw found Mr. Shaffer in the criminal court. The judge had just concluded his charge to the grand jury, and they were retiring. Bradshaw stated to Mr. Shaffer his father's wish, and asked him, if he had learned any thing of Jane Durham's case. “You've put me on a strong scent, my young friend,” said Shaffer. “I've been pumping Johnson on the subject, and old Moll. It's a foul business, I believe—but I'll manage it. You can go in the country, and no fear for your fair client. Let me see: this is Tuesday—nothing will be done in her case this week. You had better go in the country and take a little fresh air. You look thin, my young friend.” “I shall be in town,” said Bradshaw, “the day after to-morrow. If you should have business at the jail, Mr. Shaffer, do have some conversation with Jane Durham.” “It is my intention, my young friend—it is my intention. Acting in my capacity, Mr. Bradshaw, proceedings should not be had against so young and interesting a woman, as you represent this one to be, without due deliberation.” “If any thing of importance against her should turn up, Mr. Shaffer, in my absence, will you do me the favour to inform me of the fact, by note? Send it to Jackson's livery stable, with directions to have it sent out to me immediately, and your order will be obeyed.” “I will, my young friend. You need have no fear in the case. There has been foul play, and it must be ferreted out. Mr. Bradshaw, you must shake the dust of the city, and of your law books, off of you, when you get into the country, and give yourself an airing. You look thin, my young friend, quite thin, and sallow. Too much study is a mistaken notion, sir—entirely a mistaken notion. The brain's like the body, sir: fatigue it, and it cannot do as much work as when it was fresh; and this is most particularly the case, if the body that furnishes the brain with blood happens to be none of the strongest.” Bradshaw bid Shaffer “good morning,” and hurried to his office. Writing on a card where he had gone, and when he would return, he stuck it on his door with wafers, and entered the chaise with his father. In their way out, they drove by the jail, where Bradshaw stopped a moment, informed Jane Durham where he was going, and told her that she had better speak freely of her case to Mr. Shaffer. On Wednesday, the neighbours and surveyors met, and, notwithstanding long rigmarole remarks from farmer Styles, who was a bit of a scamp, the surveying progressed rapidly. On Thursday and Friday, however, it rained in torrents, and the party did not go out. Saturday morning they commenced again; when, near mid-day, as they were running the line through a wood, a horseman came bounding across one of Mr. Bradshaw's freshly sowed fields, that was skirted by the wood, and exclaimed, as soon as he got within hearing of Clinton Bradshaw— “Squire, there's one of your cases called up—a gal for murder. She was in the bar when I left. She begged and prayed so to see you, that I rode in a great hurry. She said she would pay me. Do you know if she has money, squire? Nancy said she would pay if the gal didn't. Here's a writing the gal sent you. She's mightily skeered.” Bradshaw hastily snatched the note from the constable, and read as follows, in a hand scarcely legible— “Mr. Bradshaw: They have me in court for the murder. For mercy's sake, come to me. “Jane Durham.” Bradshaw started, in utter astonishment! He could learn nothing from the officer, except that she was arraigned for the murder, and she wanted to see him. “Is it possible,” said Bradshaw, “that Shaffer has done this?” “Mr. Shaffer's not in town, sir,” said the officer. “He got word, last Tuesday afternoon, that his brother, who lives some fifty miles up the country, was taken suddently sick. He posted right off to see him, and left Mr. Scrags to attend to the state's business. Scrags had the indictment found the next day; and, this morning, he sent right over to the jail for her, and said she must be tried, whether or no, right off. The poor gal's frightened woful. When they put her in the bar, she fainted. They recovered her, read the indictment to her—she pled `not guilty.' The Judge asked her if she had a lawyer, and she said, you. I asked her where you were, and she told me you was here. She said she could git money to pay me, and I bolted right off.” Bradshaw told his father, he must leave him instantly, and hurried to the stable for his horse. He mounted, and rode rapidly to town, accompanied by the officer, from whom he could learn nothing more than what he had already communicated. The first object that met Bradshaw's eye as he hurried into court, was Jane Durham at the bar, with her hair loose about her head, and her eye fixed on the door with a vacant stare. After a moment's bewilderment, she recognised Bradshaw, and starting up, exclaimed, in accents that went to the heart of every one present. “Mr. Bradshaw, Oh! I am not guilty.” She would have fallen prostrate on the floor, if one of the officers of the court had not caught her. “She's his Miss, I expect,” said one of the crowd to another. “Likely,” said the other, who was a frequenter of such places as Dean's—“she feels bad for herself; but if she killed a man who was just seeking his pleasure, she deserves what she'll git.” The Judge, in sharp accents, said to Bradshaw, as he entered, “Mr. Bradshaw, the court have waited for you, sir.” Bradshaw told the court, “that he was entirely taken by surprise, in the case—did not know that there was even an indictment found, and from a conversation with Mr. Shaffer, he—” “May it please your honour,” exclaimed Scrags, jumping up, and interrupting Bradshaw, “I stand in the place of the state's attorney—this indictment has been found, now, three days—the counsel for the prisoner has never asked for a copy of it, nor had any witnesses summoned; he knows the law, sir.” Bradshaw here rose to explain to the Judge what had transpired between Mr. Shaffer and himself, but the Judge interrupted him. “Mr. Scrags acts for the state's attorney, Mr. Bradshaw: he tells the court, this is the only indictment that has been found—the court must either go on with this case or adjourn. What witnesses have you, sir?” Bradshaw here spoke to Jane Durham, and requested her to take a seat by him. She did so. He asked her if she had any witnesses. “None, whatever, sir—none, but God!” “Is there any one, who, you have reason to believe, would be of service to you? If there is, you can make a deposition to that effect, and I can have the case put off.” “No, Mr. Bradshaw, I have none—not one—I know not a soul, that I saw there, but old Moll, and she's against me.” “That you saw where?” asked Bradshaw. “At a place they call Dean's.” Bradshaw spoke to Mr. Scrags, and asked him if he would not consent to have the case put off till the return of Shaffer. “Till the return of Shaffer! why, Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. Shaffer deems me competent to attend to this business, sir, or he would not have requested me to do so.” Bradshaw here addressed the court, told them he was entirely taken by surprise, and wanted time to prepare for trial, and arrange his thoughts on the subject. “Why, Mr. Bradshaw,” said the Judge, “if you had any legal reason for continuing the case—the court would grant it—but it seems the prisoner has no witnesses—and a gentleman of your capacity does not want any time to prepare on the testimony of the state's witnesses—if you do, there will be time enough to apply for it when you have heard the testimony: you have no legal grounds for a continuance, sir; and as there is no other case that we could call up in its place, if the state's attorney insists upon going on with this, you have no alternative.” Mr. Scrags arose, and said he must insist upon going on with the case. “It is a very plain one, I assure your honour,” said he; “the prisoner is indicted in the first degree.” The court ordered the jury to be sworn. Bradshaw did not challenge any of the panel, but sat anxiously conversing with Jane Durham. After the jury were sworn, Scrags arose and stated to them that the young woman, Jane Durham, was indicted for an offence which involved her life; and that he would prove, by three witnesses, that, on the evening of —, at a ball, at Dean's, a house of notorious character, the prisoner at the bar quarrelled with a man named Israel Carpenter, a stranger, whom she had allured to the place, and struck him several blows over the head with a large club, and stabbed him repeatedly—of which wounds he died. The speaker here went into a disquisition on the enormity of the offence, and the necessity of making an example of some one, in those times of frequent crime. The first person called to the stand was old Moll. She appeared sober, and in a reckless, impudent manner, stated that she was at Dean's ball, and saw Jane Durham. “That very 'oman,” said she, pointing to her, “hit the man, with a club, over the head; and stab him with a dirk she snatched out of somebody's hand.” While Moll was giving in her testimony, Bradshaw observed Fritz in the crowd, and called him. He conversed with him several minutes, when Fritz left the court. As Fritz left, old Job, the jailer, entered, puffing and blowing, with his daughter Lucy by his side. Bradshaw spoke apart with Job, while Jane Durham, imploringly, beckoned Lucy to her. Jane was seated at the trial table, beside Bradshaw, and poor Lucy hesitated to enter the railing, when Nancy, who came in at this moment,—she had been going in and out all the time, —took her by the hand, and led her to Jane Durham. “Take a seat by the poor thing,” whispered Nancy, “and comfort her.” “Oh! Lucy! Lucy! won't you stay with me till it is all over,” asked Jane Durham of the jailer's daughter; and she threw her arms round her neck, while such heavy sobs, which she in vain tried to suppress, broke from her bosom, that the Judge said they had better conduct the prisoner to the window, a moment and throw it open. Old Moll was ordered to take a seat. Nancy and Lucy Vol. II. 3 supported Jane Durham to the window. The apple woman then made her way through the crowd, and soon returned with a glass of wine and water, which she insisted upon Jane Durham's drinking. “Don't be cast down, dear,” said she, “don't be cast down, it may turn out better than ye think.” Nancy wished to comfort her, but she felt there was little ground. Lucy stood by her side, holding one of Jane's hands in both of hers; which she patted with her own, with a quick, unconscious motion, while the tears rolled down her cheeks. Bradshaw said not a word to any one, but walked up and down the space between the seats of the lawyers and the little box, in which the prisoner generally sat, with so dark a brow that no one interrupted him. He spoke a few moments with Job, and while conversing with him, he met the gaze of Johnson, the watchman, who turned away his head the moment he caught Bradshaw's eye. The court now ordered the case to be resumed. Jane Durham, much more composed, took her seat by Bradshaw, with Lucy by her side. Old Moll went through her testimony. “Have you any questions to ask this witness, Mr. Bradshaw?” asked Scrags. “None, sir,” replied Bradshaw. “Bradshaw is conducting his case very strangely,” whispered one of the old practitioners to another; “why don't he have the witnesses examined apart? I suspect that it is so bad a case that he dares not cross-examine. The girl don't look like a murderess. I would cross-examine if I were her counsel.” “Call your next witness, Mr. Scrags,” said Bradshaw. “Henry Adams!” called out Scrags. Jane Durham started up like a deer, when the ball of the hunter enters its heart, and looked wildly round. Her bonnet had been taken off at the window, by Lucy; and the start, and an ashy paleness that accompanied it, were observed by all. Lucy spoke gently to her; and, as if unconsciously, she resumed her seat, pale as marble, and as statue-like. The impression, against their wishes, was produced upon the audience by Jane Durham's manner, that she was guilty. Adams had one of his hands in a sling; and he limped considerably, as he approached the witness stand. With a fiendish smile he looked first at Bradshaw, and then at Jane Durham, before he faced the jury. Adams related, with regard to the murder, just what Scrags had said he could prove. Bradshaw, when Adams had gone through his examination in chief, said he had no question to ask. The court, as well as the bar, was surprised at his conduct; but he seemed not to notice it, and spoke to no one around him. The physicians, who examined the dead body, gave in their testimony; they stated, that there were two wounds on the head of the deceased, either of which would have caused death: both fractured his skull terribly. “I have but one more witness to examine, may it please your honour,” said Scrags, rubbing his hands; “call Johnson, the watchman, Mr. Clerk, if you please.” Johnson, as he passed Scrags, whispered, “Don't you think it will do without my testimony?” “Oh, no!” said Scrags, “we must clinch the nail.” Johnson took his station on the stand, and braced himself against the railing. He stated, that hearing an uproar at the Dean's ball-room, as he went his rounds, he entered to quiet it, and there saw Jane Durham, &amp;c.—swearing almost with verbal exactness, to what the other witnesses had sworn. “Shall Johnson quit the stand, Mr. Bradshaw,” asked Scraggs, exultingly, “or have you any questions, sir?” “No, questions sir,” said Bradshaw. “Have you any witnesses, sir?” “Yes, sir; I believe I will examine you first, Mr. Scrags.” “Examine me, sir!” exclaimed Scrags. “Why, Mr. Bradshaw, I know nothing of this business. What do I know?” “I want your answers, under oath, Mr. Scrags.” “May it please your honour,” said Scrags, addressing the court, “I know nothing in the world of this business. Is it proper to examine me, who officiates here for the state's attorney?” “Certainly it is,” said the judge; “the state's attorney might be himself examined, and I see not why you may not be examined, Mr. Scrags. If an illegal question is put to you, you need not answer it. Be sworn, sir.” Scrags was accordingly sworn; his manner was very much confused. As he took the stand, he threw a furtive glance on Johnson and Adams, while they, evidently with the greatest anxiety, were observing him. “Mr. Scrags, when did Johnson first speak to you about this case?” asked Bradshaw. “He spoke to me about it last week, sir.” “When did he give you a deed of his house and lot, sir?” Scrags started, and looked at Johnson, while Johnson as intently looked at him. “Speak out, sir,” said Bradshaw, in a commanding tone. “This morning,” muttered Scrags. “He gave you a deed of his house and lot this morning! For what professional service was that deed given?” Scrags hesitated a long time. He then turned to the court, and said it was for professional advice—and he was bound not to expose the business of his clients. “Sit down, Mr. Scrags,” said Bradshaw.— “Johnson, take the stand a moment.” Johnson, with a countenance as full of terror as it ever had been of audacity, took the stand. There was a breathless silence in the court room, which had now become crowded, the report having gone through the city, that a trial for murder was going on. “Don't criminate yourself, Johnson,” said Scrags, to the watchman, as the latter passed near him, in a voice which was meant to be a whisper, but which burst out in a tone loud enough to be 3* heard over the whole court, in spite of himself. Every one looked astonished. The judge, in expectation of some startling development, said nothing. Bradshaw began by asking Johnson questions concerning the murder. In his answers, the watchman contradicted himself at every step— his perjury was apparent to all—big drops stood upon his forehead,—while in the very height of this mental torture, Bradshaw changed the nature of his questions, and asked him— “How many blows did you strike the man under the lamp?” “What man?” “Carpenter, the dead man, whom you accuse this young woman of murdering—out with it—I know it all, Johnson, as well as Mr. Scrags.” “Then, Scrags is an infernal scoundrel if he told you!” exclaimed Johnson, hardly knowing what he said. “May it please the court,” said Bradshaw, rising, “the business of to-day may well astonish. I was ignorant when I entered the court of much of what I have since learned—though I was satisfied that this young woman was innocent. Johnson murdered the man Carpenter—he suborned these two witnesses, old Moll and Adams—and he bribed Mr. Scrags to bring the case on in the absence of Mr. Shaffer. This I shall prove by the testimony of Joseph Presley, the jailer, and the reverend Mr. Norris, the chaplain of the prison, and by the testimony of an individual at the jail, who overheard a conversation between old Moll and Johnson the day old Moll appeared before Squire Bailley. And, by two whom I expect here momently, I will show that Johnson, not only by his own confession, but by the evidence of others, is the murderer—others, who saw him do the deed. Mr. Clerk, please to swear Mr. Presley. Job, tell the jury what you know concerning this business.” “Why, do you see, gentlemen and the court,” said Job, “I'll jist tell all I know about it in my own way, if you'll let me. When this poor girl was brought to jail, I didn't think her guilty, nor did Squire Bradshaw. Old Moll treated her so bad in jail, that I know she had a spite agin her. Mr. Scrags came over to the jail, and had a talk with Moll—and you know I couldn't refuse him, because he wanted to see her as a lawyer. But I kept my eye on him—and him and Johnson came there one day, and asked to see Adams—so I told 'em I would bring him out into a room—the room's got a thin petition, though it seems thick—and you can see through it in two places, from the room that jines it, that's dark. Well, I jist took Adams into that room—they said they wanted to see him alone—so I left 'em alone. But I told Parson Norris the circumstance—and I told him, according to human natur, them men was plotting villanny—because Adams had been so hurt by Squire Bradshaw when the squire saved the gal, Jane Durham, from him, that he could scarcely move in his cell; and when I told him that Johnson and Scrags wanted to see him, though it pained him every step he took, he went to the room. Well, the Parson and I went into the room that jines—and we heard them talking—Johnson said, after a good deal of talk round, that they might accuse him of killing the man—for he had knocked him over the head hard enough, and, says he to Scrags, if you'll have the indictment found agin this girl, Jane Durham, I'll be a witness against her, and so will Adams. She's a thing that has no friends,” said Johnson— his very words, (here Jane Durham held down her head, and wept as though her heart would break,) and we can fix it without any fuss—`yes,' said Adams `I hate her as I do h—ll—I'll swear to any thing; and, as she was at the ball, we can easily make it out, if we git old Moll to help, for Johnson knows that I know he did for the dead man, and so does old Moll. But I won't work for nothing,' said he: `you must promise to git me a pardon—and if you can't do that, you must bring me tools when I git well, that I can cut out.' They promised to do so—and then Johnson promised Scrags, if he would promise to do the business, to give him a deed of his house and lot.” The Reverend Mr. Norris corroborated Job's testimony. The person who overheard the conversation between old Moll and Johnson in the jail, stated, that he was standing at his cell door, next to a cell in which old Moll was confined, when Job, the jailer, came there with Johnson, and took old Moll out of her cell into the passage, and left Moll and Johnson together, and went to the cells in the other end of the passage: he could see as well as hear them, through the hole in his door. When Job was out of hearing, the witness stated, Johnson asked old Moll if she would go to Squire Bailley, and swear against the girl, according to her promise. She hesitated, and said, “You killed the man, and you must pay me high for it.” He said, he would pay her what he promised; and when Job came to them, they all went away together. Bradshaw here said, with the permission of the court, he would ask Adams and old Moll some questions. Adams was called to the stand; but he refused to move a step, and told the court and jury they might all go to hell. Old Moll was called up. She tossed her head, faced Bradshaw, and asked him—when his trial was to come on, for trying to murder a man in her house. She broke forth with the vilest abuse of him and Jane Durham. The court ordered her to be taken away. Bradshaw here arose to request an order of the court for the arrest of Scrags, but, on looking round the room, he discovered that worthy had gone. A warrant was issued for him. The jury by acclamation acquitted Jane Durham; and the court ordered the sheriff to take Johnson and old Moll, and keep them in close custody. It was now almost dark, and the court adjourned. Bradshaw told Jane Durham, who sat as if in a trance, that she was at liberty, and he would order a hack, if she wished, and take her to her house. But she said she would rather go to the jail with Lucy, upon which the kind-hearted jailer's daughter was insisting. “Wait till the crowd pass out,” said Bradshaw, “and I'll order a hack, and go with you.” Mean while, as the shades of night gathered in, old Job, with several constables, left the court-house for the jail, with Adams, Johnson, and old Moll in custody. A great and incensed crowd, which had been gathering all the afternoon, and which a large city so soon furnishes, on any excitement, and of various materials, followed after the constables and their charges, hooting, hallooing, and, occasionally, throwing missiles at the prisoners. Old Job, fearing a rescue, or that some of them might be hurt, or escape in the crowd, proposed that they should return to the court house, and wait till the crowd had gone. At this, Johnson, who hoped there would be some chance of escaping, taunted him with cowardice; and, as the constables proposed going on, Job said no more. The jail, as our readers are aware, was (and is) in the outskirts of the city: the nearest way that led to it, was across a common, in which direction the constables conducted the prisoners—the crowd following close at their heels. “We had better take the round-about way, through the streets,” said Job. “Don't bother yourself, old turnkey,” replied one of the constables; “we have the charge of 'em to the jail, and I'll warrant they get there: all you have to do, is to see they don't get out after you've turned the key on 'em.” “Well,” replied Job, “it's your business to get 'em there—that's a fact; but if I know any thing about human natur, we'll have a fuss on the common, or my name's not Job Presley—we'll have some bones broke—now mind it.” On they went, notwithstanding Job's admonition. It was almost dark, when they reached the common; the crowd still pressing on them, their violence increasing with the darkness. “Boys,” said Job to the prisoners, “I'll tell you one thing, in the beginning—I've got two pistols loaded to the top, and if any one of you tries to get off, I'll shoot him down—now mind me.” On the common, there were many loose-stones, and the bones of animals, whose bodies had been dragged there when the city was smaller. The crowd here made furious demonstrations, not of rescuing the prisoners, but of committing a violent assault upon them. Job was well known in the city, and every moment some one would call out to him, from the crowd, “To clear out, that they'd do for the villains.” “Job, we'll save you the trouble of locking them up, my old boy.” “Yes, we'll put them into the canal.” “No, boys, you can't do that,” said Job, turning round to the crowd, in answer to the last remark. “He who's born to be hung will never be drowned.” “Ha! ha! hurra for old Job Presley!” shouted a hundred voices. Such is the nature of a mob, that this little jest of Job appeased the most of them,—and seeming disposed to await the tardier visitation of justice on the prisoners, they followed to the jail, cracking jokes with Job, who kept them in good nature, till the gate closed upon himself and the prisoners. He then, through the bars, thanked them for their company, the safe escort they furnished, and bade them good night, telling them he would always rather lock them out than in; at which they gave three cheers for old Job Presley—bade him take good care of the prisoners, and dispersed in the greatest good nature, laughing heartily, as they went on their way.[1] [1] Mobs, lately, have not been so good-humoured. “That's just the way with human natur,” said Job, in great glee. “Human devil!” exclaimed one of the constables. “I thought you said there'd be bones broken crossing over the common.” “Bones broken!” exclaimed Job, in high disdain; “and so there was bones broken! Warn't them old bones, on the common, broken at a furious rate? Don't you know, according to law, there's two mistructions (constructions) upon every thing? Yes! and there'd been heads broken, too, if it hadn't been for me; but you didn't care, I suppose, as you couldn't ha' lost any brains, no how.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. After Job had seen his prisoners—Adams, Johnson, and old Moll—safely locked up, he entered his apartment, where he found Bradshaw, Jane Durham, and Lucy, who had ridden to the jail in a hack, and got there before him. With no small degree of self-complacency, Job narrated how he had put the mob in good-humour, and saved the lives, as he alleged he verily believed, of the whole concern. Bradshaw and Jane Durham had partaken of Mrs. Presley's tea; and while the jailer's wife was preparing a cup for him, Bradshaw said to him— “Job, if it is not against your regulations, I will walk with Miss Durham in the jail-yard—it is so beautiful a night; if you are willing, Miss Durham.” Miss Durham said she would like to; and that, if Bradshaw felt interest enough in her now, she would continue the account she was giving of herself, and tell how she came in the alley. And Job said, “O! certainly, squire, certainly: there's no accusation agin her—the saddle's now on the right horse. That Adams, I tell you, is a worser devil 'an the whole on 'em. I'm sorry we sha'n't be able Vol. II. 4 to hang him as well as Johnson. Well! him and old Moll will go the voyage together—that's certain. He hates you (to Jane Durham) more 'an any man ought to hate a woman.” Jane Durham turned suddenly pale, and said she knew it. “Well, he can't harm you,” continued Job, “for I've locked him up in his cell, fast enough. Yes, squire, you can walk in the yard—certainly. She can come in jist when she chooses, and you can go out jist when you choose. There's a guard at the gate, and I'll tell him. I don't think,” continued Job, laughing, “you could get over that wall, if you was to try. Chaps have escaped that way, once or twice; but it was by using some boards that were in the yard, that ain't there now.” The night of the fire, was the last one of winter, or rather, we should say, of the rough weather, as the first spring month had nearly passed. Very rough weather had occurred in this month, but by one of those magic changes, that sometimes take place in our climate, every appearance of winter had disappeared three or four days previous to the evening of which we now speak. The change produced the sensation that every one has felt—a desire to go into the open air. The night was perfectly calm, the moon was in the upper sky, and not a cloud was to be seen. The air was balmy and refreshing, and so stirless that its breath could not be felt, save in its invigorating influence. The jail was built of large dark stone, that had an ancient appearance; its small windows, with their closely set iron bars in the thick wall, that projected in a castellated manner above the roof, and hid it from view; together with its great size, and the high strong wall around, and the evident strength and security in every thing that met the eye, gave it the look, to an imaginative mind, of some of those old baronial possessions of which we read. The jail was so dark-looking, and the wall around it so high, that though the moon shone full upon it, it appeared to lie in shadow. To the right of the jail, in the yard, was the gallows, which had been erected for the execution of two pirates: beneath it were several graves. There executed criminals had formerly been buried, but latterly, their bodies had been taken to Potter's field. There was nothing in the jail yard, but some flowers, around the jailer's apartments, which Lucy cultivated—and, sad contrast! the gallows. The ground was hard, with a short dry grass upon it; and immediately about the graves, and under the gallows, the grass grew long; for those who had the liberty of the jail yard seldom trod in those ominous precincts: it might be, too, that the ground was fertilized there, by the decomposition of the bodies beneath it. As the moon shone full upon the jail, here and there, a dark face could be seen looking between the bars of the narrow windows, to catch a little air, or a little light, like helpless, hopeless despair from the regions of the damned, upon the beatitude above. An indistinct hum—the indefinable noises of the city—on whose outskirts, as we have said, the jail stood, fell upon the ear with a murmuring ceaseless sound. Save this, though it was so early, nothing was heard by Bradshaw and his companion, as they walked on through the large yard. All at once, as they approached the gallows, Jane Durham lifted her eyes from the ground, and, beholding it, said, in a melancholy voice— “See there, Mr. Bradshaw, there's the gallows, the place for murderers; shall we go and sit at its foot, and talk of destiny? If,” said she, with affected gaiety, “`there is a destiny that shapes our end, rough hew it as we may,' then am I going directly to it; but where is the Jack Ketch, and the unfeeling crowd, and the priest to shrive me?” “Jane,” said Bradshaw, “I am going directly to it, too, according to that; and, do you know, that I don't believe either of us will die there, unless as martyrs—and this, you know, is not the age of martyrdom. No, Jane, there is no more danger there for you than for me—but come, you were telling me of yourself, the other evening, when Lucy interrupted you; let us walk this way, and let me be a listener.” As Bradshaw spoke, he turned away from the gallows, and they passed round a corner of the jail, which hid it from view. There was a short bench, immediately against the wall of the jail, under a window, on which Bradshaw and the girl sat down. “If stone walls have ears,” said Jane Durham, as she sat down, “how many a sad tale have these walls heard! and, perhaps, of many a wretch as guiltless as I, of the imputed charge.” “But stone walls have only terrors, according to that proverb, for the guilty, Jane. However, there may be a listener, at the window above us,” said Bradshaw, looking up at it;—it was about two feet and a half above their heads;—“no, there cannot be, either, for half of the cells, as they call them, along here, are under the ground; and, if there should be a prisoner in this one, he is below where we are sitting—the window is far above his head, and he has no means of reaching it to listen.” “Oh, I should not care if he did hear me! Why should I—but it is natural that I should—no matter—he cannot.” She sat silently for a moment— wiped her eyes, in which she was trying to suppress the tears, and said— “Where was I? How bright the moon is! I was telling you of the day. O! how well I remember it!— when Adams came home with my father. Three years had rolled over us since we left Mr. Carlton's. In all that time I lived in a perpetual dread; daily, daily! hourly, hourly! things were getting worse. The destitution, the utter hopelessness of my poor mother's condition and my own, had gone right into my heart; and I could feel it in every throb, like a load of lead. It is there still, with a mountain's weight added to it. When I saw my father coming, I went behind my mother's bed, and they did not see me when they first entered. `What! have ye no fire—ye lazy hussy,' exclaimed my father, staggering towards the bed, `have ye no fire. Get up, and be off after some wood.' Adams laughed, and caught my father, who would have fallen as he stepped towards the bed, had he not been supported by him, and led to a seat—an old broken chair on which I had been seated. My father bent down over the coals, and continued 4* cursing my mother. Adams really seemed to enjoy it—and to take a delight in drawing him out, and getting him to repeat his imprecations and charges against her. He, I believe, had been drinking as much as my father; but the liquor made him even more fiendish, while he showed its effects much less.” “`Take that spinning-wheel there, and put it on the fire, Adams,' exclaimed my father, `I'm as cold as if I hadn't a drop in me. I'd go to hell to get warm!' “Adams took hold of the spinning-wheel, and was going to break it, when I jumped from my hiding-place, and begged him not. “He gazed at me a moment, and then handed me the wheel, saying; `Why, Bill, is that your daughter? She's pretty! What will you take for her?' “`You may have her for the asking,' said my father—cursing me. “He entered into conversation—and I did all I could to conciliate him, and please my father. While we were speaking, a man came over the old field, by our cabin, with a load of wood on a sledge, and he stepped in to warm himself. He was surprised to see we had no wood such a cold day; and he went out and brought some in—made up a fire, and threw off a good many logs for us when he went away. Adams then went down to the grocery to bring something for us to eat; and, notwithstanding I had a horrible dislike to him— and well I might, from his manner to me—yet I rejoiced on account of my mother. “After this, Adams almost lived at our house. My father was out with him late and early. Adams had acquired a great influence over him; and they brought food and clothing to the house, which led my mother and me often to wonder where they could have obtained them, as neither of them ever did any work. They would return in the middle of the night with flour, butter, eggs, meat, and various articles, of almost every kind; some of which were very costly. They had fixed up our dwelling into something like comfort, by stopping up the chinks between the logs with stones and clay. They remained within all day, and at night went out. Through the day, they would drink and sleep, and seemed anxious not to be observed; for they staid most of their time up in a kind of loft, above the room, where mother and I were: they brought home, one night, a small sheet-iron stove, and put it up there, introducing the pipe into the chimney. When they would go up into the loft, they often dragged the ladder after them, and only let it down for me to take up their dinner, or water to mix with their drink. Thus the winter wore away, and the spring came. In the mean time, Adams importuned me with the most infamous proposals, and when I treated him with contempt, he offered to marry me, and got my father to second him. My mother was bedridden; and I was her constant companion, day and night. I kept from her my trouble as long as I could, but she caught me repeatedly weeping and sobbing through the night, and insisted upon knowing what ailed me. I told her; and, also, that I loathed Adams, who, I believed, was every thing that was bad; that he was leading my father into every wickedness; and, that he would not only bring deeper sorrow on us than we had ever known, but sin and shame. My mother seemed staggered by what I said. All at once, my father's manner to her changed. Since his connexion with Adams, he had drunk less than he formerly did; he was less at home, and he was kinder than he had been for years; this made her think, though she was fast falling into the grave, that happier times were yet to come. In fact, she was comparatively happy to what she had been before we knew Adams. Not so with me. I believe, from the manner in which my father spoke to me, when he first told me he wished I would marry Adams, that he would have avoided it, but he dared not. I told him how Adams had behaved to me, and that I would do any thing to please him but that. He looked angry, as I spoke: he was perfectly sober; and I have sometimes thought it might have been at what I told him of Adams. It was after this, he became kind to my mother, and asked her to persuade me to marry Adams. When she spoke to me on the subject, I begged her, on my knees, never to mention it to me again. This was in the night: early in the morning, my father came home with Adams, and she told him what I had said. I was out of the house, but I knew it by his manner, when I came in. He looked moody, and went into the loft to Adams. In a short time, I heard them conversing together: Adams was very angry. I heard my father say, `Have patience; she's but a girl; she'll consent yet.' Adams replied, with an oath, `She must consent, or I'll blow you, old boy. It must be quick, too—I will have her.' I heard no more. Adams descended the stairs, and looked furiously at me, as he went out. This man was so much of a ruffian, that, though he pretended to be attached to me, he never could assume a gentle tone, in speaking to me. His eye glowed on me like a hyena's, impatient for its prey. I never left the side of my mother, and he never could wile me away by any art, or I know not what would have become of me. “In about an hour, my father descended from the loft, very drunk. He sat down, called me to him, and tried to persuade me that Adams would make me a good husband, and to marry him. I told him I could not. He then stamped, raved, and swore he would kill me. Then he fell to entreaty, and said I would save his life by it. He moved me so, that I was on the eve of consenting, when Adams came in intoxicated. Without saying a word, he went up stairs, and sternly called my father. What my father said seemed to pacify him, for I heard no more high words between them, the whole day; and, at night, they went out together. In the middle of the night, my mother awoke, and heard me sobbing, and began to speak to me of Adams. She used every entreaty; and, after extorting a half promise from me, that I would marry him, she fell asleep. I arose,—for it seemed to me that I never should know sleep again,—hurried on my clothes, and sat down on a chair, where I rocked myself to and fro, for hours. At last, I rose up and went out. The night was beautiful: just such a night as this. Away, in the moon-light, I saw the village, and I thought, could there be one there so miserable as I? I had no companions—no one from the village ever came to see my mother; and whenever I went there, to buy any thing at the grocery, some of the by-standers would stop me, and ask questions about my father and Adams, and throw out dark hints. The only persons that ever came to our house, were some of the neighbouring negroes. In fact, my father, but particularly Adams, discouraged the coming of any one else. I heard Adams once say to my father—`Let the niggers come; they can't bear testimony against a white man.' The night was, indeed, beautiful. I sat down upon the door-sill and looked round upon the scene, and thought that God's bright world was a mockery to me. The scene increased my sense of loneliness and desolation, and I walked behind the house and entered a dark stable, that Adams had built of rough logs,—for I felt as if I wanted to be in the dark,—and I covered myself up in the straw. How long I remained there, I do not know; but, at last, I heard footsteps near to me, and, in a moment afterwards, the door of the stable opened, and Adams and my father entered. “`Confound it,' said Adams; `while you were drinking there, I gained all this booty! What in the devil kept you so late?' “`Why,' said my father, `after I left you, as I told you, I ran that rusty nail into my hand, up to the head, in getting over a fence. My arm is so swelled, and it pains me so, that I feel it at the top of my shoulder.' “`You must bathe it in whisky,' replied Adams. But get a spade. We must put this ready into that tin box that's over the door, and bury it here. Nobody will ever think of looking into the stable for it. I like to done for that fellow. I tell you what, he loves cash. After I knocked him off of his horse, I had to give him two pretty deep digs with my carving knife, before I got it. Come, be after the spade—it's round the house, I believe.' “My father went after the spade. Adams stood within the stable, where the light shone on him through the door. I dared scarcely breathe. Once he turned his face towards me. I felt a cold chill in every vein: I thought he had discovered me. My heart seemed to me to beat so loudly, that he had heard it. It occurred to me that he knew I was in the stable, and that he would send my father away for something, and then what would become of me! As this reflection crossed my mind, I was on the eve of springing up and darting past him, when he muttered to himself, with a devilish smile, tossing up what appeared to be a purse of money, and catching it, as he spoke— “`This is a big haul to-night. Bill thinks more of his daughter than I thought was in him. I'll frighten him till I get her. She begins to give in, hey. I'll pay her up for this fooling—the way her mother's fixed is nothing to what she'll know.' “My father now entered with the spade, said he, couldn't at first find it, and as he complained very much of his arm, Adams put the money in the tin box, dug the hole, and buried it; he covered it over carefully, pushed a stick in, so that he might find the place, and came right to where I lay, lifted a bundle of straw from my side, threw it down and stood over me. After standing a moment he gathered up some loose trodden straw, that lay at my very feet, walked away, and scattered it over the spot where he had buried the box. All the while my father kept walking to and fro, shaking his hand, blowing on it, and exclaiming how much it pained him. When Adams had scattered the straw, they left the stable. As soon as they left, I hurried to the door to see which way they went: my anxiety was to get into the house undiscovered. As they passed round one corner of the house, I ran like lightning round the other, and got to the door, before they turned the front corner. Just as I was lifting the latch, they came round the corner and saw me. I pretended to have been in the act of leaving the house, remarking, `Is it you? I heard a noise, and did not know what it was.' Adams tried to be very gentle, was in high spirits, and said, `Jane, your father has run a rusty nail in his hand, and it hurts him: you ought to make a bread and milk poultice for it.' “At my father's request I did so. In applying the poultice, I was astonished to see how much the arm was swollen. He was in great pain; he drank deeply to deaden it, but without effect: at last he took a large quantity of opium, which Adams was in the habit of using, threw himself on the floor, and went to sleep. When my father awoke he was delirious—raving mad. The swelling had extended from his arm, which had become perfectly black, to the body; Adams had to assist me, while I bathed it, my mother could do nothing. She lay in bed and looked on, while the ravings of my father frightened her nearly to death. In his ravings he spoke as if he had committed crimes at the instigation of Adams; and he would curse and bite at him as he held him. This infuriated Adams so much, that he threatened to kill my father, and struck him several times over the head with such violence that he became insensible, and continued in a stupor for several hours. I could make no resistance to Adams's assault on my father, but I fell down on my knees before him, and begged him in mercy to desist. He sat down by him, as he lay insensible, and said not one word until he recovered. My father looked languidly round, asked for water, and said he was much worse, but he did not seem to know that Adams had ill treated him. I asked him, if he did not think I ought to go somewhere for a doctor. He said yes, yes, and begged me to go at once. `Go,' said he, `to Squire Bennett's, at the village—there's a great doctor comes from town to tend his wife for a cancer. Go and get him to come here, for God's sake, or I shall die. We'll pay him any thing—Adams will pay him,' Adams said not a word, but looked as moody and dark as I had ever seen him—after awhile he lightened up, and said— “`Yes, go, Jane—go at once. I'll stay with your father until you come back. If the doctor isn't there, get them to tell you when he comes, and you can go, at that time, after him.' “I have said, the village was in sight of our house, across the old fields, but we could not go Vol. II. 5 directly to it in consequence of the swamp, which lie immediately between them. The path wound by the side of the swamp, and then through a wood to the village. The wood was very lonely—the trees of great size, and close together, while many wild vines and bushes grew among them. I left the house, and hurried on, with a rapid step, to Squire Bennett's, thinking all the time of my father. I had got about half way through the wood—to the loneliest spot in it— when I heard quick steps behind, and I turned, and beheld Adams not ten feet from me. My first impulse was to run, but he called out, `Jane, your father says'—and, thinking he had some message from my father, I involuntarily stopped till he reached me. He then caught hold of my arm, and asked me, `If I had been fooling with my father.' `How fooling?' said I. `Are you willing to marry me? Stop till you answer!' he exclaimed. `There, take a seat upon that log.' `We can talk as we walk on,' said I. He forced me to sit down by him—saying, `No, it must be settled before you walk another step. You can't fool me. You heard what your father said in his crazy fits! I see you think it's true. Then, by —, you can't leave this woods until you promise to marry me. I'm not going to have you to tell tales! Do you promise me?' “I knew not what to do, or say. I was terror-stricken by his manner, for he seemed desperately resolute. `Let me go on for the doctor,' said I, at last; `this is no time to talk about such things: wait till my father gets well.' “`Ha!—you want to deceive me, do you!' he exclaimed, seizing both my hands, and looking at me with an awful eye. `You shall die before you do! Do you mark that? Yes, die on this spot! I have you now!' he exclaimed, with a malicious laugh. `I can do with you just what I choose, and then end you and chuck you into the swamp. Will you marry me, my bird?' “`I will! I will!' I cried out, for he looked as if he would fulfil his threat; and I feared he would, be my promises what they might. “`You will, hey!—that's right! When?' “`When my father is well. Let me now go, I entreat you, for the doctor!' “`Then swear it!' said he—`swear it!' “`I swear,' I faltered out. “`You must swear,' he exclaimed, `according to law!' And he drew from his pocket a small Bible that I had often read to my mother, made me get down on my knees before him, put both hands on the book, and swear to keep my promise, with the awful penalty, if I did not, of having my mother and father murdered before my eyes by him, and of being myself his victim, with the most terrible denunciations upon my soul eternally. `Here,' said he, handing me the Bible, `the book's yours; take it, and remember your oath. I'll remember the other, if you don't— mark that! Can I trust you,' said he, and he grasped my head, with a hand on each side of it, pushed it back, and looked me in the eye steadily. `Remember, you're mine, whether you keep your oath or not, and if you don't, you'll see your father and mother die, and I'll burn you up in the house with them. Go after the doctor.' “At his bidding I arose. I felt as if I were about fainting; but, fearing the awful consequences if I should, situated as I was with him, I summoned an unnatural energy, and, after staggering a few steps, hurried on. He stood, looking after me, and when I had proceeded a few yards from him, he called out, `Stop!' I stood still. `Come here.' I obeyed his command. `Do you remember your oath?' said he, between his teeth, as he grasped my shoulder. `I do! I do!' I exclaimed. `Will you keep it?' he asked, pressing my shoulder as if he meant to crush me to the earth. `I will! I will! I will!—only let me go for the doctor!' `Go,' said he; and I hurried off with all the strength I could command. I dared not look behind me until I got to a turn in the path; then I stole a fearful glance, as I turned, to the place where I had left Adams; he had followed a few steps after, and was standing as if irresolute. I stood behind a tree, and looked at him. He walked up and down several times, and then hastened off towards our house. I felt relieved when I knew he was not dogging me, and, with a quick step, I advanced, but not without casting many and many a fearful look behind. Thinking of nothing distinctly but with confused thoughts of every thing—my half promise to my mother of the previous night—Adams burying the money—what he said—his treatment to my father —my father's illness—my mother's—this last scene with Adams—passing through my mind, and acting like a spur to hurry me onwards, I soon reached the house of Squire Bennett, in the village. I entered his office, and found, within, several persons; some of whom I took to be constables, and some I knew to be neighbouring farmers. I soon discovered they were talking of the robbery which Adams had committed. “`Is there no clew for detecting the robber?' asked the squire. “`The doctor says,' observed one, whom I took to be a constable, `that it ain't proper to talk to him about it yet, he's so badly hurt. He's got two stabs in him, deep ones, and then, you see, he laid out all night and bled like a pig.' “`It's old Jemmy Swartz, the drover, you tell me,' said Squire Bennett, `who lives over by the Purchase?”' “Is it possible?” interrupted Bradshaw. “Why, Jane, I remember the circumstances of his being robbed and stabbed, perfectly: he was just returning home, after having sold a drove of cattle.” “Yes, sir,” continued Jane Durham, “the very same. The squire asked me what I would have. I related to him the terrible state of my father's arm, and said we wanted to have the doctor, who came out to see Mrs. Bennett, to come and see him. “`Why, my dear,' said the squire, who was a good-natured man, `I don't know whether the doctor will go or not: he's a great press of patients. However, you had better come and see him yourself—he'll be here about half after four, this afternoon.' 5* “I inquired after Mrs. Bennett's health, and left the office. Scarcely any one observed me, they were so much occupied in talking of the robbers. “`It will be hard work to find out the fellow that did it,' said one of the by-standers—`at least, till Jemmy is well. The robber managed well— we couldn't track him at all—he either went up, or come down the main road.' “I left the squire's, and was soon on my way home. Home! what a home! When I reached the outskirts of the woods, near the village, I sat down on a stump and wept bitterly, wringing my hands in very anguish. At last, I dried my eyes and reflected upon what I should do. I determined to escape Adams one moment, and then I thought of the horrible oath he had made me take, and that it was impossible. Well, thought I, with a casuistry, which, I think, much less wrong now, than I did then, for I shuddered while I used it, I promised to marry him when my father was well, but I did not promise that I would not tell how he has treated me, making me swear to marry him. The threats which he used in the woods, when he said, I believed what my father said in his crazy fits, and he was not going to let me tell tales— frightened me awfully—while the very suspicions that he expressed, gave me a hint, which he little thought would occur to me. I hoped, while my father was ill, Adams would not importune me, and to prevent him from doing it, I determined to tell to my father, while he was by, merely as if I were telling the news, the conversation which I had heard at the squire's office, without narrating that part of it which stated, it would be hard to find the robber. Knowing Adams's selfish nature, I was satisfied this would keep him so much on the alert, for himself, that he would forget me. Then again, I thought, if my father died, and somehow, I feared he would, the only way of escaping Adams would be, to inform the magistrate he was the robber. This could not hurt my father in the grave, and it would save me, from worse than death; but the thought of the risk I should run, if Adams suspected me in the least, of having such an intention, gave me a sickness at the heart, that almost overcame me. Had it not been for my poor mother, I don't think I ever would have returned to the house; but, after reflecting upon all these suggestions again and again, and upon my poor mother's condition, I resolved, in the event of my father's death, if there was no other way of avoiding a union with Adams, to inform upon him. I then fell down on my knees, by the stump, and clasping the Bible in my uplifted hands, I prayed, with the fervour of my whole soul, and with streaming eyes, to God, that he would forgive me if I was wrong in taking such a horrible oath— that he would suffer me to escape without breaking it—and that, if I must, to save my mother and my father, be the wife of Adams, he would sustain me; for I felt I could not sustain myself. I arose by a sudden resolution, and soon reached home. I found my father calm and conscious, but much worse. His arm was offensive to the smell, and his body, all in the region of the shoulder, inflamed and black. He did not complain of much pain. Adams was by his side; he had brought down their bed from the loft, and spread it on the floor for him. My mother was sitting up in her bed, gazing on my father. I told my father, I was to go for the doctor again, at five o'clock. He asked me who I saw, and I related the conversation concerning the robbery. My father looked at Adams when I told it. Adams started, walked about the room, whispered something to him, and after asking me a great many questions, went up into the loft. “At five o'clock, I went for the doctor. He had seen Mrs. Bennett when I arrived, and was just getting into his gig, having said he could not find the way to my father's. I addressed him, and earnestly entreated him to come, saying I would run on before, and show him the way. He inquired if I was the wife of the sick man: I told him I was the daughter. “`Miss,' said he, `I cannot suffer you to run on before and show me the way; but if you will ride with me, and point it out, I will go.' “Perhaps I should have said that, expecting the visit of the doctor, I had fixed up our cabin, and arrayed myself in a new dress, (which my father had given me, in hopes of coaxing me to marry Adams,) with all the neatness I was mistress of; for, I thought, if I looked well-dressed, he would feel more sure of being paid, and be more apt to come. “I entered the doctor's gig. We had to go a considerable distance farther, by the wagon-track, than by the path through the woods—for a gig could not travel on the path; and the wagon-track went around the woods, and came out above the swamp, into the old fields. The doctor, you know him,—or did know him, for he's dead now,—was the celebrated Dr. P—n. He spoke very kindly to me, as we rode along, and gave me an ease which has surprised me often since, when I have thought of it. I told him of my father's hand, my mother's illness; and, without my knowing it, he had learned from me every thing I dared to tell of myself and family, by the time we reached our house. My father and mother were alone when we entered. I saw Adams peering down on the doctor, from the loft. After a few minutes, he descended. The moment the doctor beheld my father's hand, he exclaimed—`Why was not a physician sent for before?' He asked several questions concerning my father, and then turned to my mother. He took a seat by her bed, felt her pulse, and spoke kindly to her, observing that he would prescribe for her, too. He then again examined my father's head and arm, and, looking at his head, said— “`He must have been severely beaten on the head—was he not?' “Adams spoke up quickly, and said—`It was in getting over a fence that he hurt his hand: he fell on his head.' “Adams eyed me, but I tried to show no emotion. “The doctor here gave me directions as to bathing my father's arm, and giving him medicines. “I told him we had not the medicines, and asked him if he thought we could get them at the apothecary's shop in the village. “`Yes,' said he; `come with me. I will drive you there in a short time. It's in my way to the city.' “Adams did not offer to go; for, in the present state of excitement in the village, on account of the robbery, he had no wish to make his appearance—yet, I thought he did not like the idea of my going with the doctor. “When we entered the gig, the doctor asked me who Adams was; and he evidently suspected something wrong from my confused answers. “`Do not be alarmed, my dear,' said he; `but it is proper that I should say to you, your father is in a dangerous condition.' “I burst into tears. He soothed me and changed the subject, asking me a great many questions of myself. At the village he obtained the medicines for me, and drove me back home. He stopped a moment at the house, repeated his directions as to the medicines, and hurried off, as it was nearly dark. “When the doctor went, Adams cross-questioned me a great deal as to what he had said to me, and of my answers. The doctor came the next day, all the way from the city, to see my father. He said the hand was mortifying; and he feared it was too late for an amputation. So it proved. Three days after the first visit of the doctor, while Adams was away—and he had absented himself a good deal since the robbery—my father called me to his bed-side, and was apparently very anxious to communicate something to me. After several vain efforts to speak, he faltered out, `Never marry Adams!'—and died.” Overcome by her emotions, Jane Durham here buried her face in her hands, and wept bitterly. Bradshaw knew it was best to let her grief have its way. After a few minutes, she continued: “My father's last words satisfied me that his fear of Adams had been the only motive that induced him to ask me to marry him. It fixed my determination never to do so. Adams hired some of the neighbouring negroes to dig a grave near the house, where the corpse was laid. My mother—my poor mother, notwithstanding all she had suffered from the neglect and abuse of my father, loved him dearly; his death afflicted her sorely. It was almost too much for her at the time; and it hastened her end. The earth was scarcely on my father, before the bed on which he died was removed out of the room, and while I was sitting on it, with feelings I cannot describe, Adams asked me `When we should be married?' Forgetting all prudence, I exclaimed, never! never! My father, with his dying breath, told me never to marry you! “Adams started as if a thunderbolt had struck him. “`Did he say that?' asked he, of my mother. She said nothing, but inclined her head. He clenched his hand, and facing me, asked, `Do you mean to keep your oath?' At this instant the doctor drove up to the door. While the doctor was fastening his horse, Adams came close to me, looking like an incarnate devil, and said, in a low voice through his teeth— “`Remember your oath! Get ready to-night— I will bring a preacher here, and we will be married.' “The doctor entered. He sat down by my mother's bed, and tried to make us forget our misfortunes, by interesting us in the case of the robbery. He said he was attending Swartz—that he was better. `To-morrow,' continued he, `the magistrate will attend him to take his deposition. He may, by taking cold, or by some imprudence, be taken off yet. It is proper his account of the robbery should be made public—he can, I believe, describe the person of the robber.' “Adams, you may suppose, was no careless listener to this. He kept his seat a moment or two; and, as I passed near him, he said, `Mind, I will come to-night:' and he left the house. My mind was made up: I looked after him till I saw him enter the woods; and when the doctor left the house, I followed him out, and narrated to him, hurriedly, my situation, and all I knew of Adams and of the robbery. “`There is not one moment to be lost!' said he. `Get into my gig, and I will drive you to the magistrate's: you must make a deposition of the facts; and to-night, instead of having you for a bride, Jane, the hand-cuffs of the constables will clasp him much more appropriately—the infernal scoundrel! Don't be alarmed: it will be so arranged, that when he comes to the house to-night, he will be taken.' “The doctor drove rapidly to the magistrate's— called the squire into a private room, where I narrated the facts that I knew of the robbery, the burying of the money, &amp;c. The warrant for his arrest was intrusted to three trusty persons. My dread was to return to the house, and spend the awful interval till the coming of Adams. I could not leave my mother alone—that was impossible—and I feared Adams might be at the house, suspect me, and fulfil his threat, or that something terrible would occur at his arrest. The doctor read my feelings, and told me not to be alarmed. `I will take you home,' said he, `and, as it is now near night, I will stay with your mother and yourself until they have taken him. He must, also, be well secured—I never read of a greater scoundrel.” “The doctor took the magistrate aside, borrowed a pair of pistols from him, and took me home. He told me the plan was to take Adams as he came through the woods, if possible, but, if not, to surround the house after he had entered. `You and I have the post of danger, Jane,' he said, `and, therefore, of honour;—I joke. Don't be alarmed; there's no danger: I shall dissect the scoundrel yet.' “`Could not the constable hide in the stable?' said I. “`Oh, no! that won't do. If Adams should be in the house when they entered the stable, he would see them, and, probably, he is now lurking in the woods, watching if any one comes to the house.' “We found my mother terribly frightened: she told us, that, a short time after we left, Adams had returned, and threatened to kill her and me, if I did not marry him. He had been up in the loft, armed himself, and gone out, saying, as he went, he would return at night. “I got supper for the doctor, while he sat and conversed with me—oh! so differently to what I Vol. II. 6 had been used to. You know, at school, Mr. Bradshaw, I was thought to be fond of study; so much so, that Mr. Lusby, as my father was poor, and could not school me, rather than I should not be taught, received me without charge. I availed myself of all opportunities of reading, at the Swamp, but they were precious few, indeed. A Bible and an old volume or two were all the books I ever had, and they were burned by my father, in a fit of intoxication. Listening to the doctor, and thinking of his kindness, I, at times, entirely forgot my own situation, Adams, and the catastrophe awaiting him. Hours thus passed away. My mother lay in bed, in a kind of insensibility—her usual way. About eleven o'clock, we heard footsteps approach the door, and some one stopped at it, as if listening. We heard a low whisper, and then the persons walked round the house. “`It's Adams, I suspect,' said the doctor, in a low tone: `he has some one with him. It may be the constables; if it is, it is no use to go out; and, if it is Adams, I had better let him come in. The constables will surround the house and be more sure of him.' “It was a bright moonshiny night: there were no trees around the house, and the constables, if they were on the alert, must have secreted themselves in the woods. “`Don't be frightened,' said the doctor; `we must converse as if we had no suspicions.' So saying, he took up the conversation, as though there had been no interruption. We heard some one again advancing, and, in a moment more, the door opened, and Adams entered, with an ill-looking man, dressed in a rusty suit of black. He spoke to the doctor gruffly, told his companion to sit down, and took a seat himself. “`Is Mrs. Durham worse?' asked Adams of the doctor. “`Much worse,' said the doctor, without turning to Adams, for he was scrutinizing his companion in black. “`Why, Hollands,' he exclaimed, `is that you?' “The man was somewhat confused, but he soon rallied, and said, `Yes, sir.' “`What brings you away out here? there is a poor chance for you in the country, isn't there?' “`People die every where, sir,' replied Hollands. “`I brought him out,' said Adams, `to attend my wedding. Jane and I are to be married to-night. It's rather soon after the funeral, but her father and I were friends, and it was his last wish I should marry her, that she might have some one to take care of her, and—' “Here, the door opened without the ceremony of a rap, and three constables entered, followed by a magistrate and two other persons. Adams started up, as if his first impulse was to dash by the constables out of the house, but the number deterred him, and he sat down. “`Mr. Adams,' said one of the constables, `I arrest you, sir.' “`For what?' asked Adams, keeping his seat and endeavouring to be self-possessed, while his husky voice and blanched cheek betrayed his emotions. “`Here is the paper,' said the constable, showing the warrant, while himself and companions got close to him. “`Who applied for it?' asked Adams, turning to the magistrate. “`Jane Durham,' replied Mr. Bennet. “`I never killed the old man, her father,' exclaimed Adams. `She has sworn to a d—d lie. Ask the doctor there, he'll tell you that his hand mortified, and killed him.' “`'Tis not for murder,' said the magistrate; `it is for the robbery of Jemmy Swartz.' “Adams trembled, while his assumed self-possession forsook him. He looked at me with a deadly hate, then to the door, as if he would escape; but he saw the effort would be hopeless, as several persons stood between him and it—and by it one, not the most valiant of the party, ostentatiously displayed a great horse-pistol. After a strong effort to recover himself, he seemed to reflect whether my testimony could affect him—for he had some familiarity with courts of justice—and asked, “`Can what her father said against me, to her, be given against me?' “`To make a long story short,' said the magistrate—`she saw you bury the money.' “Adams snatched a knife from his pocket, and sprung at me—but the constables caught him instantly. He struggled fearfully with them, striving to get at me, but they hurled him to the floor, and bound him hand and foot. He loaded me with imprecations, and said he would have my life yet. `This is not a hanging matter,' said he. `It is only penitentiary, and that don't last for ever. When I'm out, look out.' “`Don't mind him,' said the magistrate. `Come and show us where he buried the money.' “I led them to the stable, and pointed out the place. They soon dug up the tin box, and found in it five hundred dollars in notes, and a few dollars in silver. The notes were in the drover's pocket-book, which had his name on it. I left them searching about the stable, and went into the house to see after my mother. Just as I entered, one of the constables said, pointing to the man whom the doctor called Hollands, who came with Adams—`We ought to take this man to jail—oughtn't we? he's his comrade.' “`You've no proof against me,' said Hollands, very much frightened. `I never heard tell of the robbery before. I can prove, pint blank, that I was in town. Adams will tell you I had nothing to do with it—had I, Hen?' “`You had as much to do with it as I had,' said Adams. “`Sir,' said Hollands, turning to the doctor, `I hav'n't seen him, sir—I'll swear to it—I hav'n't seen him for these two weeks, before to-night.' “`What did he want with you, Hollands?' asked the doctor. `Tell the whole truth, now—that's the best way for you. Honesty's the best policy.' “`Why, sir,' said Hollands, after a good deal of hesitation, and stammering, `I'll jist out with the matter. You see, Adams come to me, in town, last night, a little after dark, and he asked me to go and drink with him, and I did. While we were drinking, he asked me how I come on; and if I got many bodies for the doctors now-a-day; and if 6* they paid well. I told him there was bodies wanted, but the season not being sickly, there was a poor chance of them; that I wanted one very badly, just now; and would go halves with any body who would help me to get one, and give him no trouble about it. `Well,' said he, `if you'll do me a small favour, I'm your man. You know,' said he, `you've played the parson in some of our shines. If you will put on your old suit of black, and go out to the Long Swamp with me, and pretend to marry me to a girl there, I'll give you a body that's right by the house—a fresh one: you may have it all to yourself. You can ride out with me in a carry-all I've got; and when you've married me to the little hussy, I'll help you to dig up the body. You can take it to town in the carry-all.' I asked him who the girl was. He said she was a fool of a country girl, who was his miss; that she bothered him to make an honest woman of her; and that I could do it as well as the best kind of a parson. I agreed to come with him, and we came out.' “Think of it, Mr. Bradshaw, it was the body of the father, with which he meant to procure the ruin of the daughter! Why dwell more upon him. He was convicted, and sentenced to the penitentiary for ten years. “In the court-house, at his trial, he could not hide his hatred of me: He cursed me outright, and threatened my life, while I was giving in my testimony. He asked to address the jury just before they retired. He told them I had killed my father; that my character was infamous; that a negro who was my paramour—had assaulted the drover, and given me the money which I had buried in the stable, and that I laid it on him to screen myself and the negro. After the death of my father, and the conviction of Adams, my mother and myself continued to live at the Swamp. She was rapidly sinking to the grave; Dr. P— continued to attend her, through the spring and summer, till she died. I might say he was at the house almost every day.” Here Jane Durham paused, and Bradshaw could see the blush mantling on her cheek, even in the moonlight. “I have narrated,” she continued, “the most wretched part of my life, save that which I have to add to it of the last week; but not the most sinful. You know, Mr. Bradshaw, that Dr. P— had every qualification to win a woman's affection. Reflect, reflect, sir, I was little more than sixteen. He was an angel of light to the men I had known. He had been the means of rescuing me from Adams—he had befriended me when I had no friend—he had been kind to my father—I saw him daily by the bed-side of my mother, he supported her and me, when, but for him, we might have starved. He brought me books; he praised my mind; he sat by me for hours in our lonely dwelling in the old fields, as my mother lay insensible on her bed, and taught and read to me. He praised my person, and told me how I should adorn it—and all this before he spoke to me of love. I had thought of him by day and by night, and loved him without once thinking of the passion, or its consequences. Is it any wonder that I gave him my affections, yielded to him without any tie, but the tie which we are told is linked in sorrow and in shame, when I could not, would not yield to Adams, let what might be the tie. I know, I know he loved me,” said she, bursting into tears— “he may have struggled with his feelings more than I struggled with mine. Better born, better bred—but for the distinctions of society and my miserable family, I might have been nearer to him, if not dearer; and more honourable, if not more happy—yes, yes, much more happy—for the very education he gave me—the refinement he taught— the sensibility he enlivened—told me more acutely what I was. But if I erred in yielding—mastered by a passion which I could not control—yielding to a tie of love, when no other tie was dreamed of— and not that—for I deemed him unmeasurably above me—if I erred, has not mine been the sorrow, and the shame, and the deep humiliation. Who, I ask, would hear my story, and wish to make it their own? Who can hear it, and not feel that I have some justification for what I am. No, merciful and holy God! I may fold another to my heart, for the daily bread which I eat in bitterness, and in bitterness give to my child; but he who first won it is there indelible and ever present as yon bright star in heaven—if I ever yield this faded and frail form for bread, it shall not be to sustain my own miserable life—no—but my child's, my child's, there is no prostitution, at least of the soul, in that. But why dwell upon this? I thought I had taught myself entirely to hide such feelings. The world, sir, has no ear for that sophistry, though it is an impulse of our better nature, that tries to apologize for the errors which our pride, as well as our conscience tell us is not justifiable.” “Towards midsummer, my mother died: she passed away like the flame from the wick, when the oil is exhausted. She said just before she died to Dr. P—, `I see how it is, with you and my daughter. I wish, Oh! how I wish it had been otherwise. It would have saved me a pang keen as death, but you have a good heart, and if you do not cast her off—and do not let her dying mother charge you do not—she will be happier than her mother, though she was a lawful wife. Bury me by my husband—he was unkind to me while he lived, but he was my husband, and now he's in his grave, he cannot hurt me, though I am near to him, with even an unkind word.' I did not think my mother dreamed of my situation with Dr. P—. She had seen it all—but not until it was too late—and then her affection for me would not let her speak of it—it burst out, though, in her dying words. We buried her by my father. Long, long, after the grass waved over her, and I had left the Swamp, and lived in the city, did her last words sound in my ears, sleeping and waking— Those words of hers, a `pang keener than death,' have been a thousand deaths to me. I thought of them the first morning I spent in prison with that wretched woman till I believed the judgment of God had fallen on me, and I was to be like her: they will haunt me till the sod is on me, as it is on my poor mother. But whoever sinned that did not sorrow for it: here, even in this world, the unknown retribution of the other weighs us down with an undefinable dread—a dread, that, while it stretches to the dark beyond, encompasses us here, poisoning our joy, and maddening our sorrow. “No one not placed in my situation can judge of my feelings. It is easy to say what I should have done, but who would have done otherwise? —who could have done otherwise?—My mother's last words rung in my ears, but I had yielded before I heard them. They but made me unhappy when I recalled them. Dr. P— sometimes brought to the house in town where I lived, friends to sup with him: and, among others, Mr. Glassman. Mr. Glassman has his faults, I know, and they are said to be many and grievous; but you know he is a fascinating man, and no one sees his errors but those who feel them. Almost every evening, through the winter, and often in the summer, he would sit hour by hour, and converse with Dr. P—: he was his most intimate acquaintance. He possesses that worldly wisdom that Dr. P— so much wanted, and he was often his adviser. Dr. P—'s brow would often darken, when playing with his child, as he thought of its birth; but the lectures at the college, after he was appointed professor, and his extensive practice, with his increasing ambition, (for, as he felt his powers among men, his purposes became more determined and loftier,) so occupied his mind, that he rarely, at last, let such reflections trouble him. I observed this more particularly, after he became acquainted with Mr. Glassman. Mr. Glassman, who seemed to know every thing, would talk to him in such eloquent terms of his profession—of the great men in it—and of the glorious opportunity there was for him to become distinguished. Oh! how Mr. Glassman loves talent—it made even me, ambitious of cultivating my mind when I've heard him converse. Whenever he would come to see the doctor, and he was not in, he would scarcely stay a minute. I once asked him why he did not stay longer. He looked at me with a soul-searching eye, and said—`Jane, I have a bad character among your sex—the doctor is my friend: he loves you, you love him—if I call here while he is out, and stay, some busy tattler will tell him, that my visits are prompted by another feeling than that of friendship. Though I may have deceived one of your sex, when they trusted in me—so, don't trust me— I never deceived one of mine. The doctor is my friend: on his noble and generous nature I might rely with confidence, that no slanderous imputation of the world would break our friendship—but, I should be careful that no suspicion should, for a moment, darken it—particularly, when that suspicion would strike a tender point—a point upon which men are most vulnerable—and when I can so easily prevent it. Therefore, do not, from the impulse of your courteous feelings, ask me again to stay, because a woman's voice has a power over me, which I have not schooled myself to resist.' “Mr. Glassman always treated me with respect, and when other gentlemen came to the house with the doctor, his manner to me made them respectful. Dr. P— had told me of Mr. Glassman's infirmities—that he was subject to fits of low spirits, and that, without being at all an habitual drinker, he too frequently sought relief in the cup. One evening, I shall never forget, Mr. Glassman came to the house intoxicated. What he had drank did not enliven him; on the contrary, it increased his melancholy almost to madness. When he entered, I observed he looked sad; but I did not discern any thing in his conduct that showed his condition. Dr. P— saw it, and tried to cheer him with lively conversation, but Mr. Glassman shook his head, and said— “`No! P— it won't do. Come, Jane, sing to me, sing Burns's song to Mary in Heaven. You are the image of a woman I loved and love, who loved me more even than you love P—. I wronged her. She is dead: if the grave would but give her back to life again, what a different man should I be. Remorse! remorse! I cannot drown it. Lethe is but a fable stream, or I would make a pilgrimage to the world's end to find it, if, but to take one draught of its oblivious waters. Come, Jane, sing to me—sing to me.' “I, accordingly, sang for him. After struggling with emotions that shook his soul, he became calmer, and spoke of his past life. While he told how wildly he had erred, and how, in the violence of his passion, he had crushed his better nature, he conveyed a moral to us, which he meant to convey, no doubt, and which was not the less effective from the unobtrusive manner in which it was drawn —not in bold relief, at the end of the narrative, but woven in every word of it. “In the mean time, Dr. P—'s practice became so extensive that he had hardly a moment he could call his own. When the cholera was here, he was up and out night and day. I begged and prayed with him, for my sake, for his child's sake, to take care of himself, but he could not resist the voice of distress—he often neglected the wealthiest to visit the poorest. His humanity became known, and in the middle of the night, there would come for him some child or wife, and beg him to go and see a father or husband. When he has asked the place of their residence, I've shuddered to hear some miserable lane or alley mentioned, where vice, poverty and disease were struggling for supremacy. I became so much alarmed one night, brooding over my fears, that, when the doctor, who had been out twice since midnight, got up to attend to one of these wretched calls, I threw my arms round him, and begged him not to leave me, feigning sickness myself. `Jane,' said he, kindly, `don't be frightened for me. I could not rest with the consciousness that a poor wretch was ill whose life I might save. Think, think a moment—your heart will tell you I should not. You know I am a sinner,' continued he, smiling, `and I must do something to wash away my sins. Boerhaave says that the poor are the best patients; for God is their paymaster: so, come, let me go; and the first rich man who sends for me may go somewhere else for a doctor, and I will stay with you.' He kissed me, and went. Near daybreak he returned, and complained of being somewhat unwell, and asked to see Glassman. I sent for him; and Mr. Glassman and he were alone for half an hour. When Glassman came out of the room, he said, the doctor was quite unwell; that he had given himself medicine, but that some of the profession must be with him; he, accordingly, hastened after them. Vol. II. 7 When I went into the doctor's room, he looked wretchedly. He asked me to sit by him and hold his hand, in a voice scarcely audible, so rapid had been the advance of the disease. I summoned all my energies, called the servants and told them to get hot water, and all the other appliances, for I was satisfied he had the cholera. But he beckoned to me, and said, `No! no! only weak: I want rest —sit by me.' I had no doubt of his own knowledge of his case, and sat down by him. Alas! he who had so much sagacity in others' ills, knew not his own.” Here, Jane Durham folded her arms closely, and, by a strong effort, continued to speak, but each word seemed to choke her. “He died—the next day, he died—I need not dwell upon it—we were left—my child and I— to—(here she burst into a flood of tears, that choked her utterance.) “Did you know Dr. P—, Mr. Bradshaw?” she said, at last. “Slightly,” said Bradshaw. “He deserved all the regard you gave him, I have no doubt, Jane; for every one reveres his memory.” “Yes, yes! I stole into his room, when they had laid him in his grave-clothes, and gazed upon his manly face, that had so often smiled on me, till I thought he could not be dead—and I spoke to him in a low voice, as if to wake him. I know no more —I had a kind of dream. I thought I was buried by my mother, and a flower that Dr. P— had planted on my grave, was rooted in my heart and nurtured there, and watered by my tears—Oh! the gladness, when those tears flowed freely—and then, I thought, Adams stood over me, with that man beside him, and that they were bartering for my body. I started up with a terrible scream. I had been two weeks delirious. Oh! the agony of returning consciousness. I looked around me with a stony eye, that was as dry as an arid desert, and I thought, if I only could weep, the fountains of life would flow healthier, and cool the fiery fever in my veins. I wept, at last, long and bitterly, and I felt a sensation at my heart's core, as if some one had done me the deepest injury, and I was learning to forgive them. I know not why I should have had this feeling, but so it was; and whenever it returns upon me, though I cannot help it, I shudder frequently at my own dark brooding, with a superstitious dread that such repinings bode no good. “After my recovery, Mr. Glassman told me there was a house of the doctor's which I had better occupy. Accordingly, I moved into the one in which you saw me. `The doctor,' he said, `had left money in his hands for me.' “When I came to reflect upon it, I hardly thought it could be so: but what could I do?—and how generous in Mr. Glassman so to cover his kindness! Mr. Glassman frequently comes to see me— very frequently; but he treats me with the same respect and kindness that he ever did. I know the world would not believe it, but, sir, we are as we were. “Mr. Glassman told me he had been more regular in his habits, latterly. Sometimes he would come to see me, excited, and ask me to sing to him. Once, since the doctor's death, he was very ill, for some time, from a fit of excess. I had him brought to the house, and waited on him. As he recovered, I would sing for him, and read to him, hour by hour. Since then, until lately, I did not know of any thing of the kind in his habits: but he's a strange man; yet, I would lay down my life for him—for, whatever he may be to others, he is every thing that is kind and gentlemanly to me. “Week before last, when the carpets wanted shaking, and the windows washing, Mr. Glassman told me that he would send a man, who had been hanging about his office, to do it. The man, accordingly, came. I did not observe him particularly, but gave him directions what to do, told Phœbe to assist, and thought no more of him. Several times he came and asked me to look at the window or carpet, and see if he was doing them to please me. I thought the man was anxious to please; and, that I might not wound his feelings, I looked over his work, and told him it was all right. After he had done the work, he called several times, to know if there was any thing more to do. Phœbe saw him when he came, and I frequently heard him in the kitchen, in conversation with her—but I thought nothing of it. One evening,—the night you rescued me in the lane,—I was sitting, thinking of Mr. Glassman: for I had not seen him for two days, and I felt alarmed. I was wondering why he had not been to see me, as I generally saw him twice or thrice, daily; when, nearly nine o'clock, a hack drove up to the door, and this man, whom Mr. Glassman had sent to clean the carpets, came in and told me that Glassman was intoxicated and crazy at a tavern; and that he was in a private room, and kept calling for me. The man said, he himself was doing an odd job there, and happened to see Mr. Glassman in that state; and when Mr. Glassman was put in a room, the tavern-keeper told him to wait upon him. `Glassman was quiet,' he said, `a moment, and asked if I hadn't been there, and if I was not coming.' My feelings—my many obligations to Mr. Glassman did not allow me to hesitate. I asked the man if he could take me to the place: he answered, quickly, `yes,' and said he had brought a hack for that purpose. I determined to go, not having the least suspicion, and being anxious to do what I could to restore Mr. Glassman to himself. Accordingly, I hurried on my cloak and bonnet, and entered the hack with him. We drove rapidly, I knew not whither. The man spoke not, and I sat absorbed in my own reflections. After driving a considerable distance, and, I thought, turning many corners, we at last stopped in a narrow lane. It was dark, and I could see objects very indistinctly; for, you remember, it was a gusty night. The man stepped out and tried to open the door of the house—knocked repeatedly: no answer was given. He then entered the hack, and told the hackman to drive to Dean's. I asked him, as we drove away, if Dean's was the tavern where Mr. Glassman was? He said `yes.' `Why did you not drive there, at once?' I asked. He hesitated a moment, and then replied, `that he had come there for a nurse for him. The tavern-keeper 7* said he'd better get one, and directed him here.' It seemed to me strange; but I reflected the man was, perhaps, not very bright, and said no more. We soon stopped at another house. I heard the sound of a violin. Around the door was a crowd of men and boys, whose conversation shocked me. The man who rode with me, asked a boy he called Fritz, if he had seen old Moll. The boy replied, `No.' The man then came to me, and said we had better go in. He was evidently perplexed. I asked him if Mr. Glassman was in there. He replied that he was—but that we'd have to go through a ball-room, that, perhaps, I wouldn't like. I still had no suspicion of the truth of what the man had told; but I thought he must be stupid or drunk. I entered the house with him. “I have seen little of the varieties of life, but I immediately discovered from the persons around the door, that this was a ball of the very lowest description of people,—every moment the profanest and most shocking language saluted my ears. Can it be possible, I thought, that Mr. Glassman is here?—The man preceded me, leading the way into the room where the dancing was; saying that we must pass through it, to get into Mr. Glassman's room. The company in the room I cannot describe—they were wretched men and women; almost all of them were intoxicated, and many were drinking at a counter that stood in one corner covered with decanters. I told the man I would turn back, and he must come in the morning, and take me to Mr. Glassman. `Just come on,' said he, `to the other end of the room, and take a seat a moment, and I will see the landlord, and we will find Mr. Glassman.' I followed after him, and took a seat—the men and women, as I passed along, stared at me, particularly the women, and addressed me in a language, much of which I did not understand, but what I did made me shudder— they called my companion, familiarly, `Parsnips,' and asked him what game he was after now, and who I was. He gave some answer I did not understand, and pointing to a seat, told me he would be back in a moment. I heard him ask, as he left me, of some one who stood staring at me, if he had seen old Moll—`Yes,' said the person, `she is at the other end of the room.' Left alone, I scarcely had time to think, before a number of men and women gathered round me, and asked me who I was. The men attempted to seize me and take off my bonnet, and the women stood by cursing me. One person, who was quite a lad, told them to let me alone—that I was nothing to them. “`Yes,' said a woman, pushing a man towards me, who looked like a countryman, `put her and this new chap together.” “`Hands off!' said the one they called new chap; I can't stand every thing.' Here a terrible confusion and quarrelling occurred: knives were drawn, and lives threatened. I know not what happened; I buried my head in my cloak to hide the sight. I heard the cry of `murder!' `don't kill me!' and `Johnson, you'd no business to hit that man!' amidst many others! but I dared not look up. A crowd appeared to pass out the door, and descend the steps tumultuously. I looked round the room—there were very few persons in it, and they were drinking and laughing at the counter. I did not know what to do—I feared to address them, and I thought, at first, that I would go out and try to find my way home, but the quarrelling, noise, and imprecations without, in the street, determined me to stay where I was until the tumult had subsided—I sat still in the most painful anxiety; it appeared to me a lifetime. I kept my head buried in my cloak and bonnet. As two persons passed me, I heard one say to the other—`There's a gal sowed up; let's see who she is?' `Oh! no matter,' said the other, and they passed on. After, what I thought a very long time, the man who took me there came to me, and said—He thought I had gone home, or he would have been with me before. `The larks are waiting,' he continued; `you had better let me take you home—Mr. Glassman's not here.' I followed him out with alacrity: there was not a single person at the door; we entered a hack, and away it drove. I asked him if there was any one killed, he said, `yes, there was.' `Killed!' exclaimed a woman's voice, beside him, that made me start. `I guess there was more 'an one done for—Johnson, the watchman, I reckon, could tell about it—he treated me, to find out if I knew, but I guess old Moll's not exactly a young one—but he must keep a look out when the court sits. I'm pretty much slewed. Who's this gal you've got here?” “No matter; I'll show you before long,” said he, in a voice that startled me—it sounded so like one of old. I hoped for the best, but I said not a word. Why was I so situated? What did it mean? I knew not, yet I feared to speak. The night was so dark and gusty, that I looked out in vain to observe the place. We stopped at length, but I could not discover where. The woman got out first, and tried to open a door; she could not, and called to the man to assist her. “Wait a moment,” said he, as he went to her. He opened the door for her, returned to the hack, caught me in his arms, lifted me out, and told the hackman to drive on. I called out to the driver, and entreated him not to leave me; but he laughed, cracked his whip and redoubled his speed. The man bore me into the house where you rescued me, Mr. Bradshaw. Not until the moment he discovered himself, had I the least supposition that the man was Adams. I thought myself safe from him at least for ten years.” “He escaped from the penitentiary two months since,” said Bradshaw; “he came here under an assumed name, and remained unsuspected until he stabbed a man in a row; he was then arrested, and discovered to be the notorious Adams who robbed Jemmy Swartz—and who was well known for other delinquencies before that affair!” “Oh! Mr. Bradshaw; how shall I express my gratitude! In that lonely horrid place I thought no help could come. Those women, gracious heaven!— to think that they should delight in the ruin of one of their own sex—that old Moll, I never did her any harm—yet she appeared to entertain the most demoniac hate towards me—her laugh!—I thought myself among demons”—(here Bradshaw and Jane Durham arose from the bench against the jail under the window on which they were seated, as we have described.) “What will become of Adams?—though he is in these prison walls, I do not feel safe.” “Your oath! take that,” exclaimed a voice behind them through the prison window. At the same moment, Jane Durham said, faintly, “Gracious heavens! Adams, he has stabbed me!”—and would have fallen, but for Bradshaw, who caught her in his arms, lifted her from beneath the window and looked up at it. A sinewy arm, bare to the shoulder, was thrust through the bars; in the hand of which the blade of a large Spanish knife gleamed bright in the moonlight. Between two bars above it protruded the head of Adams—the countenance was livid with rage—he made two or three desperate plunges at Jane Durham as Bradshaw bore her beyond the reach of the instrument—and then something was heard to fall within the prison—his face became death-like—his hand dropped the knife—his features were horribly convulsed, while, in choked accents, he exclaimed, “The chair has fallen—I'm hanging by the head—save me—hell— Oh!” He made repeated convulsive efforts to catch the bars with the hand that was thrust between them; but he had either lost his self-possession, or he was so situated as not to be able to bend his arm to reach them, for he strove in vain. “Support yourself with your other hand,” exclaimed Bradshaw, who comprehended his situation in a moment, and whose humanity merged every other feeling, “and I will get you assistance from Job.” As he spoke, he bore Jane Durham towards the jailer's apartment. “I am not hurt much, I believe, sir,” said she, as they reached Job's door. “I was not near enough for him to strike a deadly blow. For Mercy's sake, Mr. Bradshaw, leave me, and get him released from his awful situation—he will die, and it will be my fault.” Job was smoking his pipe, cozily, in his room, talking with his wife and Lucy. Bradshaw hastily informed him of the situation of Adams, looking, as he spoke, at Jane Durham's wound. It was on the top of the shoulder, bled profusely, but did not appear deep or dangerous. “The devil,” said Job, as he jumped up to get the keys, his thought occupied not upon Adams's danger, but in wonderment how the ruffian could have contrived to hide the knife from him. “The devil, I didn't think the scamp could circumvent me that way—a large Spanish knife, hey! How could he a got it?—I'll take my Bible oath he hadn't it when I put him in—nor when I took the irons off of him. (Job and Bradshaw were proceeding to the cell of Adams, as the jailer continued.) I took the irons off, you see, Mr. Bradshaw, because the scamp was in a poor way. Yes, he must have clum up to the window with the chair. The irons hurt his leg, for that's badly swelled. I don't see how he could have got his head between the bars—it's rather of the biggest. (Here Job opened the first door that led to a range of cells, in one of which was Adams.) This lock turns as slick as grease, and the door opens without creaking—it ought to—all's well greased. I like to get in an' out, Mr. Bradshaw, without making a noise that every rascal can hear.” “Job, you tread as light as a lady—it's only my step that sounds.” “Yes, Squire, I tread light, though I be heavy. You see I'm used to it; and, at night, I commonly puts on a pair of Indian rubbers, so that I can take the rounds, and hear and not be heard.” As Job spoke, they reached the cell of Adams. The cells, as we have observed, were partly under ground. The window was high up, so that Adams, when he overheard the conversation, was compelled to put the chair against the wall, and stand on the back of it to discover who were without. The jail wall was very thick, the windows small, and the bars nearer the outside. The horizontal bars were closer than the upright ones; so that Adams, when he mounted on the back of the chair, (and it was a precarious foothold,) to see the individuals immediately under his window, had to protrude his head out sideways, and then turn it to look down. Enraged by Jane Durham's narrative of his conduct, and determined to take her life; yet, being unable to reach her as she sat, he had to await the moment of her rising, to strike with the probability of satiating his vengeance. By the movement of his person, in the desperate effort to inflict a deadly wound, he had pushed down the chair; and being unable, in that situation, to turn his head and withdraw it, he hung, of course, suspended by it. He could not relieve himself, as we have stated, with the hand that held the knife; and the other, not yet having recovered from the blow which Bradshaw gave him on the shoulder at old Moll's was useless: consequently, when Job and Bradshaw entered his cell, they found him hanging by the head, with his back towards them. A slight, jerking motion was made by his legs. Bradshaw caught hold of them, so as to relieve him, and called out to Job to put the chair against the wall, and get his head loose. “Wait one moment, Squire,” said the imperturbable Job, “till I fasten the door. No tricks upon travellers. Ha!” continued he, as he placed the chair against the wall; “look at that, now— one of his shoes is off; he had his knife sewed in the sole of it. (Mounting the chair, and feeling his head.) He's dead, Squire—gone—died upon, I may say, a nateral gallows for such a jail-bird. He wasn't born to be drowned—though he didn't expect such a hanging as this. I can't get his head loose—he's as cold as them leg-irons. Well, among his other robberies, he's robbed the penitentiary of more 'an five years of services, adjudged; and of many more debts of the kind, on which, if I may speak according to law, the state might have got judgment, but not execution—ha! ha! (All this time, Job was trying to get the head out.) It can't be done, Squire—we'll have to get help, and slant his body round, and get him out that way. Let go his legs, Squire. You needn't to hold him up—he's as dead as though he was hung according to law: and that would have been a more honourable death, and a better one, to a certainty, than going this gate—for he'd Vol. II. 8 had time to repent, and a priest with him to pray —and time to think about his sins, and not gone out of the world trying to commit murder. It's awful,” continued Job, standing on the floor with folded arms, looking at the body—“it's awful! You can't help feeling, though you oughtn't to feel for such creaturs. It's his own fault, and he's nobody to blame but himself. You see; Squire, I let him have the chair, because he said his leg pained him, when he lay down with it, all the time—and he couldn't walk on it—and he wanted to set up a little. It's wrong to be kind to these prisoners—they always pervert it to harm themselves. Well,” said Job, as they left the cell, “I must get help, and get him down— and send off for the crowner and have a 'quest over him. Every prisoner in this 'ere jail shall know his end; and let it be a warning to 'em not to try to escape, or cut shines through the bars.” Job went for help, and Bradshaw to learn if Jane Durham needed a physician. The knife of the ruffian had penetrated her shoulder about two inches. The wound had bled freely, but the blood was now stopped by the appliances of Mrs. Presley, who thought that nothing serious was to be apprehended. Jane Durham here stepped into her room for a moment, and Bradshaw followed her. “Miss Durham,” said he, “the only time I had the pleasure of seeing Dr. P—, he attended me professionally: his death was so sudden that I never remunerated him—you must allow me to cancel my indebtedness,” and he handed her his pocket-book. “No, no! Mr. Bradshaw, I am indebted to you for more than life, and you cannot owe—” “Nay, my beautiful, brave ally, you will deeply wound my feelings, if you do not take it. When you leave here, look over Dr. P—'s books, and you will find that I am indebted to him this amount —if you do not, you can return it. Come, pretty Jane, my old schoolmate, you must take it—do you not remember how I used to pluck the wild flower for you, when you sang me a sweet song—that was a boy's gift, for the pleasure you had given; this is no gift at all; it is offered only because it is your due.” She stretched forth her hand; Bradshaw pressed it, and left in it the pocket-book. “Jane, you told me once, after I had given you a rose, that you kept the stem when every leaf had gone. Now, to please an old schoolmate, just keep the book when its leaves are gone, in memory of auld lang syne. Remember, I give it to you as a knight of old would give his glove—a gage that I will be your champion, let who will enter the lists against you.” “Mr. Bradshaw, you press me to the earth with gratitude,” said Jane Durham, while a blush glowed over her cheek, neck, brow, and bosom so vividly that she hid her face in her hands. “Gratitude! I should be the grateful one, Jane: why, for the little service I did for you the other night, I have been greeted with shouts, huzzas, and praises from hundreds—for knocking down Adams, and for the mere circumstance at the fire. Take care of your wound, Jane—you must cure it without a scar—you must not have the least memorial of that ruffian near you. Good night.” “Lucy,” said Bradshaw, as he entered the adjoining room, “do you know whether your father has got down the body of Adams yet?” “Yes, sir,” said Lucy, who was putting on her bonnet and cloak, “they've got it down. Good gracious, ain't it terrible? Daddy says that his neck is broken and twisted, and his under jaw is broken, and many of his teeth are pushed out—but he was a bad man.” “Yes, Lucy, very. Where are you going?” “I'm going sir, to stay with Mrs. Mulvany: her old man, Josey, is not very well, and she wants company.” “Who goes with you?” “My daddy, sir.” “I can save him the walk, Lucy. I go directly by Nancy's; and you must let me be your beau.” Lucy blushed; and on the instant, her father entered. “Ah, squire!” exclaimed Job, “I've just been to hunt the knife; here it is. It's pretty much knife, I can tell ye. Well, he'll never see it again, that's sartin. His head's mashed all to pieces, sir. We've got him ready for the crowner. Squire, I'll send you word when they meet, that you may depose. Come, Lucy.” “Job, I'll save you the trouble—I go right by Mrs. Mulvany's, and I'll see that Lucy gets there safe.” “Why, squire, I can't think of giving you such a trouble.” “No trouble, Job, at all; it's right in my way, man. Job, you know you told me that there were no boards in the jail yard, and you defied me to get out,” said Bradshaw, laughing. “Well, so I did, squire, and so I do,” exclaimed Job: “you don't think you could ha' got over this high jail wall with the bench that was under Adams's cell window, do you?” “Not exactly; but, if I were a prisoner in your jail, Job, and I were to break jail, and get into the yard, don't you think, with the steps of the gallows, and the rest of it, I might contrive to scale the wall?” “Furies! squire, that's true bill; and I never thought of it before—ain't that wonderful? You see, boards that's left about the jail yard's my fault, but it's the sheriff's fault, if the gallows is left standing—I'll tell him, though.” “Why, Job, it's not natural that a jailer should think a malefactor would mount the gallows, to make his escape, hey!” As Bradshaw and Lucy left the jail, Job walked round to the gallows, and shook the steps and planks of it—then, after taking keen looks over the jail, he proceeded to his apartments, ruminating upon what had happened, muttering, as he went— “It won't do to take the gallows down now; we shall need it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8* CHAPTER III. “Lucy, those are pretty flowers of yours,” said Bradshaw to the jailer's daughter, as they passed them; she tripping along by his side. “Yes, sir; but sometimes I think I'll never touch them again—the soil is so poor, and then the prisoners, who have the yard, take them, or tread over them so often.” “What beaux have you at the jail, Lucy?” “Not many, sir—and, indeed, Mr. Bradshaw, there come so many bad men to jail, young men, too, who look as if they should be good, that though I don't suspect people, it seems to me I ought.” “And, Lucy, have you never been in love?” “I have had likings, sir, but—” “But what, Lucy?” “I thought they would not please daddy, sir, and I tried to forget them.” “And you have not altogether succeeded?” “Not altogether, sir.” “Lucy, I'm too young to give you advice. I may stand in need of it myself, but—” “Daddy says, sir, he thinks your advice is better than any of the lawyers'.” “Ah! does he, Lucy? Well, as your daddy thinks so well of me, if ever I can be of any service to you in any way, you must not forget to ask it, will you?” “No, sir, I will not.” “Lucy, you have behaved so kindly to Jane Durham that you deserve to do well. I'll lay my life on it, you are the best girl that ever was in a jail. But beware of those persons about the jail: bad men love the fair flower, but they do not care to nurse it—even before it fades they neglect it; and when it withers, they rudely trample it in the dust—you have heard Jane Durham's story?” “Yes, sir, and a hard life, indeed, she has had of it. Adams is the worst man, I think, I ever heard of.” “True, Lucy; but any one would shrink from such a wretch as Adams, by a kind of instinct; his roughness, his ferocity are not relieved by a single virtue that I can discover, and his countenance tells the tale on him at once—but there are others that are good-looking and fair-spoken, who are as bad as Adams.” Lucy held down her head, and sighed. “Lucy, let me give you this advice. Do not listen to any of these men, who have the liberty of the yard, if they speak to you of liking you. And when your good heart leads you to ask some sick prisoner through his prison windows, how he is; do not let your gentle, girlish sympathies too quickly believe the tale he tells you of his innocence. Receive his gratitude as your mother or your father would receive it. Do not think too much of the pretty words he tells it in—he may be very bad and seem to be very good. Some one of them may tell you, he has reformed for love of you; but it will be much harder, may be, to keep good feeling alive in him, even though he has, than it is to cultivate your little bed of flowers, by the jail wall. How careful you have to be of that! The soil is so bad, and the prisoners who have the yard, take them, after you have so kindly tended them. Thus will it be with the gentle virtues—with love even of you, Lucy, in such a man's heart—his rude companions will tear them up after you have planted them, and nursed them with so much care, and you'll have so often to water them with your tears. What kind of man is Johnson, the watchman, Lucy?” “Oh! sir, from what came out to-day, he must be a very bad man. But I have always heard he was a very bad man. He got a good salary as a watchman—and he owned the house he lived in. His wife and daughter took in sewing, and every cent they made, he spent; and he treated them very badly—so folks say.” They here reached Nancy's door, and Bradshaw told Lucy to remember him to Nancy, and bid her good night. “Bradshaw,” exclaimed Nancy, who was coming out of a gate by her house. “Come in, and let me see ye yerself, and I'll remember ye the better, man.” “How's Josey, Nancy?” “Better, honey, better—he's had a bad rheumatiz, but he's better. That's Lucy with ye; she's come to stay with me, is it? Come in a minute. I've just been in the yard to get a brick to heat for Josey's feet—it's better than a flat-iron, ye see, because that won't hold the heat so long, and the handle's in the way—it's very grateful to the rheumatiz. Come in.” Bradshaw and Lucy entered. Bradshaw sat a few moments, talking with Nancy, and then bid them good night. “Lucy, dear,” said Nancy, when Bradshaw had gone—“where did ye see Bradshaw?” “At the jail, ma'am.” “Hand me that black bottle, Lucy, dear, in the corner of the cup-board. My hussy, Beck, ye see, runs about of errands so much through the day, that I let her go to bed. And niggers being, as they hain't got the sense of white people, require more sleep, like dumb animals. And what did Bradshaw say to ye, honey—how come he to come with ye, dear?” proceeded Nancy, while she busied herself in making a little hot toddy for Josey; tasting frequently, to ascertain that the ingredients were properly mixed, adding now a little brandy, now a little sugar, and, occasionally, a little water. “What did he say to ye, dear.” “He gave me good advice,” said Lucy, innocenty. “About what, honey,” asked Nancy, glancing over her shoulder, at Lucy. “Not to trust the people at the jail—any of the men who have the yard, if they should speak to me of liking me,” said Lucy, blushing. “Good advice,” said Nancy, pausing in the act of raising the glass to her lip, which she affected just to sip—“Bradshaw's a young one to give it, though—and he's not a professor of religion; but he's a good heart. He said nothing to ye but good advice, Lucy?” “And he asked me of Johnson, the watchman, and his family.” “That's an awful business, to-day, Lucy—that Johnson is as black-hearted as the evil one himself—he deserves hanging. I don't know when I felt for a human creatur more than for that poor thing to-day. I wonder how she come to be at Dean's—it's a low place;—she's pretty, and she's been awfully tempted. We're sinners all. Lucy, dear, just tread lightly into the back room, and bring me the Bible that's open, on the foot of Josey's bed. How did you leave Jane Durham?” “She's happier than she was; she's been walking in the jail-yard with Mr. Bradshaw, all the evening.” “Walking in the jail-yard with her,” said Nancy to herself, with a half humorous doubting smile, as Lucy left the room. “Good advice agin, I wonder! The poor thing likes Bradshaw; I just see where it'll end—there be a fuss 'atween him and Glassman.” Lucy here returned, and Nancy said to her:—“There, Lucy, that's a good girl. Take a seat, and trim the candle, dear; I'll do some knitting. We are weak creatures, all. That was a most excellent sarmunt we had last Sabbath morn, honey, from Mr. Gowler; there was real unction in it. `Lead us not into temptation,' was the text. Temptation is an awful trial, Lucy, and hard to resist. This is a wicked world; the natur of man is as prone to evil, as the sparks to fly upward, and for that matter, woman's too. I sometimes, honey, set and think—between whiles, when I'm not selling at the court, and Beck's away, and I'm not talking to no body, I have an awful time to think—I set and think of the snares, and pitfalls, and trials, and temptations, and backslidings—backslidings is a common sin, Lucy,— that besets the whole of us. I sometimes wonder to myself, how the world gits on so well, considering all things—the vanities, and wickedness, and tribulations, and besetments that's around about us. But, we must buckle on our armour, as good Mr. Gowler says, and fight the wicked one. Read out, Lucy; read out—your voice sounds to me like as if it was meant to read the word.” Mean while, Bradshaw proceeded to his office. On his way he met Fritz. “Fritz,” he exclaimed, “why did not you return to the court to-day, with the witness, who, you told me, was with you when you saw Johnson murder the man?” “Why, Mr. Bradshaw, I've been hunting him all day, and I'm after him now. I'll bring him round to your office, to-morrow.” “Well, do. How did you get away from Johnson, that night, Fritz—I never asked you?” “Two of the boys came up, sir, and hustled him while I run.” “What was the reason the lane was so still that night?” “Why, sir, the fuss sent some of the boys to covey, after the ball broke up—they were afraid of being brought in—and others were prowling about slily to catch some steamboat characters, who had been in the lane, just after dark, and had a fight with some of the boys. We had mustered strength, and expected to pay 'em up. I was looking round for them, when Johnson caught me. I expect he thought I knew something of the murder, and he wanted to put me in jail, and keep me safe from telling.” “Did not you pass me in the lane, that night, just before you get to old Moll's.” “Yes, sir, one of the boys, who was with you, came a-head and met me. He told me who you was, and that they were a going to see you through the lane. I thought I'd go on; for the watchman, I expected, would be after me.” “Well, Fritz, take care of yourself, and bring big Bob round to my office as soon as you find him. Oh, why do they call Adams Parsnips?” “Because, he said, sir, 'twas the first thing he ever stole.” Bradshaw had scarcely left Fritz, while he walked along leisurely, enjoying the calm moonlight, when he was overtaken by Willoughby and Cavendish, arm in arm. “Bradshaw,” said the Kentuckian, “what girl was that you were walking with past the theatre, on the dark side of the street?” “Where were you?” asked Bradshaw. “At the corner, by the magistrate's office,” said the Judge, “your tongue was running like a steamer's wheels. Who was she?” “Job's daughter.” “What Job?” asked the Judge. “The jailer's daughter, Lucy.” “Bradshaw you're a pretty fellow! Quite appropriate, though—and in character—a thief-taker, one night, and the gallant of a jailer's daughter another—I suppose you have the laudable intention of doing your best to make old Job as great a sufferer as was his namesake,” said Cavendish. “Judge, we must get you a tub, by Jove—it's all you want to be the Diogenes of our modern Athens.” “Well, I can tell you this, Bradshaw, in earnest,” said the Judge; “that, if you have any intention of playing the gay Lothario with this poor girl, who, I am told, is as good as she is pretty, that when I light my lamp to find an honest man, I'll not walk round by your office for the purpose.” “Judge, you'll finish your days in the pulpit, I've no doubt—and, like too many of the cloth, you'll think that all virtue is confined to your class. No, sir; your Roman friendship estimates my honourable feelings rather lowly. I'll flirt with her who likes flirtation—I'll go as far as I am led—I'll meet, perchance, more than half way, the proffered blandishment that courts solicitation. Nay, I may pass the Rubicon, but not o'er the ruins of a broken heart, a violated friendship, or a betrayed confidence.” “I'm glad to hear you say that, Bradshaw,” said the Judge. “I know you are something of a Cæsar in ambition; and I did not know but what your morality also resembled his.” “The Judge lectures you like a very Cato, Bradshaw,” said Kentuck; “and I hope you'll lay it to heart: for he's a righteous judge.” Vol. II. 9 “You're marvellous godly men, upon my word!” exclaimed Bradshaw, laughing. “You've been to the theatre—hey! The Judge here would enact the Hypocrite to perfection, and Kentuck, I think I hear you as Maw-worm, exclaiming, `He's a saint.”' “Then you don't think you'll ever play the character of Joseph,” said Kentuck to Bradshaw. “Joseph!” exclaimed Bradshaw—“what, Mrs. Potiphar's Joseph?—never, if from no other consideration than a respect for my garment. The Judge now enacts another Joseph, Joseph Surface, admirably—he has such `excellent sentiments!”' “This all may be very witty, Bradshaw,” said the Judge; “but I'm sorry to hear you express yourself so—I hope it is the ambition of saying witty things, and not your notions of morality that dictates to you. And, to speak upon a matter of company—jailers' daughters and frail ones in allies, —you had better confined your republicanism to your politics.” “Bah!” said Bradshaw. “My republicanism teaches me self-respect in all respects.—Don't you know that the great poet says you must not —“have too much respect unto the world They lose it that do court it with much care.” Yes, sir; this world is like a coquette—woo devotedly, and you're jilted—treated as Garrick treated his friends— “He let off his friends as a huntsman his pack; For he knew, when he chose, he could whistle them back.” But stand upon your reserved rights, as a man, which you did not part with, when you became a party to the compact of society—and society will respect you. “Who lives in that splendid mansion?” continued Bradshaw, pointing to one near them. “G—,” exclaimed the Judge. “Well—his father was a Scotchman, and was sold, on his arrival in this country, as an `indented servant,' to pay his passage money. He applied himself, after his time was out, to commerce—made a fortune; and there his son lives, a very clever fellow. The servant who will come to his door, when you pull the bell, is an `indented servant'— sold to pay his passage from the ould country: no more and no less than what G—'s father was. Lucy Presley is the daughter of old Job Presley, the jailer, whose father fought in the good fight of our revolution, and held the respectable station of lieutenant in the continental army. He had not a sixpence when the army was disbanded, and he married the daughter of a tavern-keeper, and died a short time afterwards of strong waters. Job was born after his father's death; and, in due time, ran about his grandfather's tavern, no doubt, a curly headed ragamuffin, who held a traveller's horse for a copper, and consorted with stable boys, whose greatest envy was a well-appointed horse jockey. Lucy is of a good family—hey, Judge! Yet, the Miss G—s might think it strange to meet Lucy Presley in society;—nevertheless, Lucy has more beauty and more intellect than all the Miss G—s put together: and I am not saying that they are not very clever girls—good, honest, true-and-true descendants from old G—, an `indented servant,' who was no less a personage than their grandfather. Now, I think no more of the Miss G—s because they have wealth—nor should I think less of them, if they wanted it; and it is perfectly indifferent to me who their grandfather was so long as they are ladies, and behave as such. But should it ever so happen—and such things often happen— that Lucy, humble as she now is, should be invited into society, and I should hear the Miss G—s speak of the distinctions of `their set,' and the sin of admitting a jailer's daughter among the aristocracy, I should, with the coolest voice in the world, mention who Lucy was—her family,—and ask if one generation could make or break titles to aristocracy; and upon what aristocracy was founded?—whether the grand-daughter of a soldier of the revolution, who was beautiful and good, had not as high claims upon the attention of society, as the grand-daughters of an honest old Scotchman, who was a freeman, or, rather, a freedman—because he worked out his freedom, but not in the battle-field.” “Why, Bradshaw, I thought you liked the Miss G—s,” said Cavendish. “So I do—and I like them because they have much less assumption than persons generally, who have acquired wealth as they did;—and so long as they are as they are, God speed them, and continue with them all the blessings that wealth bestows. But the moment they claim peculiar privileges and immunities, on the score of wealth,—I would give the honour to whom it is due,—I would blazon the grandad's indentures on their front door, and do all I could to promote a match between one of the Miss G—s and their `indented servant,' because I should be for keeping their wealth in their peculiar line of aristocracy—to which society I would confine them.” “D—n the G—s!” exclaimed the Judge, who was full of family pride, for he claimed descent from one of the first, wealthiest, and foremost families in the revolution—a family that had possessed an immense entailed estate, which, under our republican government, as estates tail are not known, passed out of their hands, by a prodigality which knew how to spend, but not to earn. “Bradshaw, every body says you write those lampoons that are making such a fuss in Jekyl's paper. Why don't you lampoon these upstarts?” “Now, Judge, there you're wrong. I should begin my lampoon on family pride, if I lampooned any such follies. I wish Selman were here; I'd make a whole host of such quotations on the subject: from Burns, about rank being but the `guineas' stamp,' and a man being the `gold, for aye that'—yes, and the ploughman-poet might have said, that there is less alloy in the unstamped gold than in the guinea—from Pope, on the `blood of the Howards;' from Tom Jefferson; from Burke, who, though he was the great champion of aristocracy, did not respect it much in the person of the duke of Bedford, when defending himself and son from the duke's attack—from, in fact, all the great names of modern and ancient times. It's well enough for him who has no other distinction but his wealth, to boast of that—it's all he has to boast of. He who has nothing but family pride can have pride, of course, in nothing else. We who carry our stock 9* in trade upon our shoulders must—ay, you laugh —you think we may not have enough to speak of —no, we never should have enough to speak of ourselves; let others speak of it—that's the kind of pride that I pride myself in. Self-sustainment is my theory, blow high or blow low, and I'll practise it.” “You're right, Bradshaw; only I'd have this self-sustainment, as the true Kentuck spirits have it, from the heart, from impulse, from nature,” said Willoughby. “So would I,” said Bradshaw, “have it from the heart, but I'd call the head in as a co-operator. I tell you what it is, we must always call the head in to the help of that same fluttering, palpitating, trembling, impulsive agent. Why, though you are lion-hearted, yet, if the net is round you—you remember the fable—you are confined by cords that you cannot break, unless the little mouse cuts through them, and lets you out! Your heart may be ever so big and so valiant, but when it gets you into a scrape, Judge, when the net's around you, you have, after all, to set that mouse of a head of yours to work.” “Mr. Bradshaw, what do you mean by that?” asked Cavendish, petulantly; “I don't understand you, sir.” “No harm, Judge, no harm,” replied Bradshaw, laughing. “I think too well of your heart to disparage your head.” There were few persons stirring at this hour. This conversation commenced in a fashionable and much-frequented street, and before it had continued long, the young men came to a halt, at a corner, where there had been a great fire, and where nothing stood around them but its ruins. Here they parted: Bradshaw strolled on, for he wished to be alone, and the excitement of the day had banished sleep. Standing, at last, upon a hill that overlooked the city, for he had rambled to a favourite spot, ruminating upon the thoughts which the conversation had called up, he said, in soliloquy, almost aloud—“Bah! what can the few wealthy men in that city do for me; leave me their fortunes they won't, though I were ever so much their humble servant; give me a daughter one of them might, if the lady fair were willing, and if willing she were— “Though mammy and daddy, and all should be sad, Whistle, and I will come to you my lad.” I must remember that quotation for Selman's benefit—who couldn't reconcile mammy or daddy afterwards. But I can earn wealth sufficient, without any such proceedings. The vote of him who lives in the largest mansion in that full city, is no better than his vote who tumbles with a dozen others out of a shanty. Ay, and it is often given, with not half so much disinterestedness— the great mass of the people mean to do right— they seek no office and expect none. Give me old Job's vote and influence in preference to G—'s any day. And as for family pride—if that counts— have I not the proud imperial purple of the “commonwealth of kings,” the Pilgrims in my veins— made hotter by this southern sun, which my fathers preferred to a colder beam? No, let these men dive and dig, and delve and toil on to make wealth, and be aristocrats—heaven save such aristocracy—nothing else can save it, beyond one generation in our country. Truly, has some one said, that here “the children of the rich are the parents of the poor.” Let them get wealth— they'll spend the more some day to do honour, may be, to their humble servant. Let them get wealth, and bring their sons up in sloth; 'twill keep them out of my path. If Talbot were poor, he might do something; but now, bah! he will be spurred into an occasional feeble effort, and fail. And his wealth will give him all the leisure to canker and fester over it. But I—the stern necessity is on me to labour—to do head work—and if the sweat of the brain is like other sweat, a plebeian offering to the goddess industry, may be I may pluck, in my rough road, a certain leaf or two, and hide the sweltering stain upon my brow, as Cæsar hid his baldness. `Impossible,' said Mirabeau—`that word is not in my vocabulary,' nor shall it be in mine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Scrags had so far eluded justice. When he left the court-house he forged a check upon one of the banks for ten thousand dollars, obtained the money, and left the city in a steamboat before his absence from the court was observed. It was thought he had gone to one of the new states in the far West. As Mr. Shaffer had not yet returned, the court appointed Bradshaw to attend to his duties; in their fulfilment, the case of Johnson, the watchman, was presented to the grand jury. They found an indictment against him for murder in the first degree. Johnson sent his wife and daughter to Bradshaw, to implore his tenderness. Of course, he resisted; but not without being deeply moved by their tearful solicitations. A by-stander, to have heard them, would have supposed that Johnson was one of the best husbands and fathers in the world. In such cases, lawyers are often placed in situations that probe their feelings to the core; but as Erskine said, on a memorable occasion, they should “do their duty, and leave the consequence to God.” What lawyer has not observed this difference between the sexes, namely: If a woman is indicted for an offence, who attends her in the awful presence of justice, to console and cheer her, braving the stare of the gaping crowd, the humiliation of such companionship and such a connexion?—a mother or a sister. How seldom a father, a brother, or a husband! If a man is placed in the bar, who is most solicitous for him?—always his aged mother, his broken-hearted wife, or his sorrowing daughter. Shame, sorrow, degradation, contempt, are all forgotten in the strength of a woman's love. How seldom in a man's! If he attends—and when does he?—his look towards the prisoner at the bar, though his nearest relative, is often dark and scowling—a sense of the shame that attaches to himself weighing on him at the very crisis of the prisoner's fate. A woman's look is that of compassion and sympathy. She thinks not of her own situation, or of the opinion of the crowd around her, as regards herself: if she glances at them, it is only when some part of the testimony makes for or against him, or the judge or the lawyer speaks upon some strong point, that she may discern their opinions of his fate. She watches his every movement: if she is near him, she anticipates his every want—she hands him the glass of water to quench the fever that anxiety has produced—she walks by his side from the court to the prison, and from the prison to the court—she sits as near to him in the court as possible—she would sit in the bar with him, would they allow her—she waits, for hours, to exchange one word with him through the grated door—she rakes and scrapes all she can to make him decent at his trial, that his appearance may produce a favourable impression. If the awful verdict is against him, she forsakes him not, though all the world have forsaken him. In the last extremity, she is by his side with a love that, like a noble arch, pressure strengthens. She attends him to the very foot of the gallows—his ignominy, his ill-treatment of her are not thought of. Whose wail was that, which, when the fatal drop fell, pierced every ear and every heart with the conviction that there was one whose pang was keener even than the dying convict's?— 'twas hers. And she will beg his body, and compose decently the distorted limbs, and bury him with care. The spot where he is laid, though known as the murderer's grave,—which the world points to with horror, and where superstition says no grass will ever grow,—is, nevertheless, a hallowed spot to her, where she will even plant the flower and nurture the grass, to induce the belief that, if superstition is correct, the sleeper is innocent. What the poet makes her say is true— “I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart, I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art!” Johnson made a desperate struggle for his life. He employed, as his counsel, the celebrated Mr. W—t. In this city, where our narrative is laid,—which, as we have before told our readers, for good and sufficient reasons, we may not name, there being, may be, more truth in our story, than is necessary to make a novel,—in this city it was customary for the ladies, (the very fashionable ones,) to attend important trials, when it was understood that there would be nothing said that a delicate ear might not hear. The ladies were very anxious to attend this trial. First of all, perhaps, they wished to see Jane Durham, of whom they had heard a great deal; and, secondly, they were desirous of hearing the speech of Mr. W—t, who was esteemed, by many of the best judges, the best advocate of our country, and that of Bradshaw, whose rising reputation, and marked character, were becoming, daily, a subject of more interest; and, lastly, if we were scandalous, or even disposed to attribute to the sex some of those characteristics, which certain cynics have attributed to them so often, that the common ear has been abused, we should say, some personal considerations of the array they would make mingled with their curiosity. Certain it is, that, at the house of Mrs. Grey, the day before the trial, several of the fair fashionables, among whom she was the leader, after debating the matter among themselves, whether there would be any impropriety in attending the trial, resolved, unanimously, that there was none. And Willoughby, Cavendish, and several other gentlemen, were advised that their services, as beaux, were expected on the occasion. “They should have called us into the council,” said Cavendish to Willoughby, “before they determined to poke themselves into the court-house, and push us out of our seats, to witness a trial for murder! This is worse than yours and Bradshaw's mania for thief-catching. They'd better commence the practice of the law, at once. They've got to wearing the breeches,—at least, so their ankles indicate,—and, by and by, they'll throw off their own apparel, and stand revealed in ours. But, Kentuck, we must take the girls, Miss Carlton and Miss Bradshaw: they want to hear W—t and Bradshaw—a proper curiosity in them. I'll wait on Miss Bradshaw.” “You'll miss the figure, there,” said Kentuck. “I have engaged to attend her and Miss Carlton, myself. I'll resign Miss C. to you, if you say so.” “Ah! jumps the cat that way? I thought you told me once, you `looked to the west when you went to your rest'—quoting Burns.” “So I do; and I may tell you that the Purchase lies directly west from the city—but I'm Bradshaw's friend, as well as yourself. And as I am a broad-shouldered Kentuckian, I can push my way through the crowd better than you; and I want Miss Bradshaw to have a good seat, that she may hear her brother.” “Very friendly,” exclaimed Cavendish. “Well, from the same friendly motive, I'll escort Miss Carlton, and follow in the wake of your broad shoulders—she takes an interest in Bradshaw, too, I take it.” The night before the trial, Bradshaw, an hour after dark, closed the book which he was reading in his office, and, rising, said to himself— “To-morrow comes on the trial of Johnson.— W—t will make a great speech. He ought to; he is gray in greatness, with the experience of fifty winters on his head—with an intellect ripened, matured, in its fullest vigour. Like certain rare Vol. I. 10 trees, it bears fruits and flowers—the imagination of the poet and the subtlety of the logician at the same time. Well, I've been studying hard all day; I can't know the case better if I study it till it comes on. I'll slip on my best bib and tucker; wear a careless mien—a smooth brow—and go to the party:— but— “`Saddle White Surrey for the field to-morrow.”' When Bradshaw entered the court-room the next morning, he found Nancy seated at her usual place, within the door of the large area, from which passages lead to the clerk's office, the civil court, the criminal court, &amp;c., eyeing sharply over her specks the motley crowd—anticipating, no doubt, a rich harvest, for she had a more than usual supply upon her table, temptingly arranged. “Beck, you hussy, stand close to me. Two for a fip, honey—them apples are two for a fip. The frost killed 'em all last spring—and, remember, this is spring again. Ah! Bradshaw, is that ye— no news of Scrags yet.” “No, Nancy, not a word.” “Ye may depend he's gone for good, Bradshaw; he was the meanest white man going—he was jist like one of them apples I've pitched away there— rotten to the core; he'll be overtaken yet in his iniquity, ye may depend. Ther's a judgment agin him.” Bradshaw passed on. “Beck,” exclaimed Nancy, to her girl, “pick up yer spelling-book; don't ye see it's drapped in the dust. Though I'm none of yer abolitions, as ye call 'em,” continued Nancy, addressing an acquaintance who was buying some apples; “for I believe niggers were meant for slaves—yet they ought to have learning enough to read God's word. Beck can spell now. In her book ther's some reading besides spelling; and I like to look over it myself sometimes—it's as good as a sarmont.” “Ah, dears,” continued Nancy, as she turned and beheld Miss Bradshaw and her companions; “ye've come to hear the trial, hey? Well, it ain't often such sweet girls as ye come to court— and I wish all that come could have such happy faces—but that can't be. Miss Emily, your brother has brought this murder to light, bravely;— he kept dark till the nick o' time.” The ladies stopped and spoke with Nancy. She pressed nuts and apples on them. Kentuck put his hand in his pocket to pay for them. “Kentuck!” exclaimed Nancy, (she gave him the appellation his friends generally gave him,) “wait till I ask ye, will ye? Dears, get good seats. Jist on them chairs, behind the jury-box, is a good place. Josey Mulvany!—I was jist calling to Josey to get ye chairs—but the poor man's got the rheumatiz.” The ladies entered the court room, and were so fortunate as to obtain the seats recommended by Nancy. “Who is that beautiful creature that Mr. Bradshaw is talking with?” asked Mary Carlton, of Willoughby, a few minutes after they were seated. “Where?—Ah! to the left of the box opposite;—that's the fair lady for whom he played knight errant.” “What a sweet face that girl has beside her!” “She's the jailer's daughter. Bradshaw calls her his jaileress of hearts.” “Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. Grey. “Why, Mr. Bradshaw is as republican as democratic in his gallantry, as he is in his politics.” “We must give him credit for sincerity, at least,” said Miss Carlton; “for, unlike many politicians, he practises what he preaches.” Bradshaw here discovered them, and made his way through the crowd to the side of Mrs. Grey. The lady laughed, and repeated to him what she had said. “Lucy, lady,” said he, in reply, “is what Halleck, our American poet, calls one of `Nature's Aristocracy.' The flower that blooms in a jail yard, is as beautiful, to me, as that which grows upon the castle walls,—more so, if in itself it is beautiful; because it must have rare virtues to win the respect of the inmates of such a place—and Lucy has won it. Flowers, lady, cannot choose their birth-place, any more than the fair beings of whom poesy makes them the type.” Here the O! yes—O! yes—of the crier rang through the court-house. Bradshaw took his seat at the trial-table. Johnson was brought in, and placed at the bar. The prisoner made an effort to look frank and unembarrassed. When the indictment was read to him, he said, not guilty, in a husky voice. His weeping wife and daughter followed him, and took their seats touching the railing which encircled him. They looked around anxiously—at the judges—at the lawyers—at the crowd—where, seemingly finding nothing in the expression of their countenances favourable to their relative, they turned, with imploring eye, to the glittering throng of their own sex, who, in the pride of beauty and wealth, occupied nearly half the place allotted to the lawyers, and all the space behind the jury-box,—there, indeed, they met sympathetic looks. “What detains us, Mr. Bradshaw?” asked the judge. “May it please your honour, we wait the coming of Mr. W—t. The clerk had better call the witnesses; in the mean time Mr. W—t will, no doubt, arrive.” While the names of the witnesses were being called, Mr. W—t entered. Mr. W—t was a tall, thick-set man, dressed well, may be, with a little dash of dandyism; for, knowing the interest the cause had excited, he was not unmindful either of the physical or mental man. He had a full face, rather cadaverous complexion, which proceeded partly from intense study, and partly from excesses, that had impaired his constitution in early life, though now he was a model of all “that might become a man.” From complete obscurity, and doubtful parentage, he had forced his own way; and not only reformed the indiscretions—to use no harsher term—into which an acute sensibility, contemplating his friendless condition, in his start in life, had plunged him, but 10* he had won a reputation, which, for forensic eloquence and legal acumen, was not surpassed by any of his countrymen. He had devoted himself exclusively to his profession, what so few American lawyers of commanding talents do. His eye was blue—nose hooked—forehead compact, and broad. His manners were those of a finished gentleman. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Mr. W—t, “I see I shall have to gird on my best armour. I am rather rusty in criminal law—it is some time since I have practised it—though we often gather our greenest laurel in this field.” Bradshaw bowed, and, smiling, said, he came not to gather laurels, but to accustom himself to the field in which they were won. W—t smiled, shrewdly, and shook his head. The testimony given on Jane Durham's trial against Johnson was now presented to the jury in extenso. We need not recapitulate it. Job Presley, the Rev. Mr. Norris, and the person who had overheard the conversation by his cell door, between Johnson and old Moll, were, of course, examined, and cross-examined by Mr. W—t, but all his skill could not detect them in a contradiction, nor lead them into one. The next witness called to the stand was Fritz. He corroborated all that Jane Durham had stated of the events at the ball. It was he who told the crowd around her, in the ball room, to let her alone. He stated, that the quarrel arose between the stranger, Carpenter, who was killed, and some of the frequenters of Dean's, about a girl who lived with old Moll, called Sal, and because of his intrusion among them, he not being, as they said, of their set. The girl had brought him to the ball, and quarrelled with him after he got there; and when some of the company took it up, she gave one of them a dirk, and told him to stab Carpenter. Carpenter was stabbed, but not seriously, when, in the midst of the riot, Johnson, the watchman came in. The company gave way to him, and did his bidding, all but Carpenter, who, not knowing he was a watchman, used ill language to him, at which Johnson struck him repeatedly with his pantoon, and led him by the collar out of the house. Johnson treated him so roughly, that some of them called out not to kill him. Fritz and another followed Johnson out; the watchman led Carpenter by the collar some way from the house, when the crowd returned to it.— Carpenter asked Johnson where he was going to take him, just as they got by the lamp, and Johnson knocked him down: he fell with his head against the curb-stone. While he was down, Johnson kicked and beat him, telling him to get up. Finding he could not rise, the watchman stooped down, and tried to lift him, muttered something to himself, and walked up to old Moll, who was standing in the shade, against the house, not far off. They spoke in a low tone; Fritz and his friend not wishing Johnson to know that they observed his conduct, returned to the ball. Fritz was followed by Big Bob, the person who was with him, and saw Johnson assault Carpenter—his testimony was the same. Jane Durham, also, was examined. When she told of Johnson's manner by the dead body, Mr. W—t inquired how she came there. In answer, she narrated how Bradshaw had rescued her, in a way that interested the whole court—while every one was impressed with her beauty, her friendless condition, and her modesty. All eyes were alternately fixed upon Bradshaw and her. “Bradshaw is really blushing,” whispered Talbot, (the gentleman, our readers remember, who reproached Jekyl for being a blacksmith, at the debating society, for which Bradshaw commented severely on him)—to Mrs. Grey: “this is the first time I ever saw the soft suffusion in his cheek.” “When for such a cause shall we see the soft suffusion in your cheek?” asked Miss Carlton, who overheard him. “Never, I fear, Miss Carlton, if I have to frequent such places as this young woman has described, to show my chivalry.” “I hope you may never frequent them for any other purpose,” said Mrs. Gray, who liked not Talbot's implication, and who was one of your ladies who cared not what she said. Mary Carlton turned, and affected to attend to the trial—but her thoughts wandered, and were troubled. The physicians who examined the dead body were sworn: they testified, unanimously, that there were two wounds on the head, either of which was sufficient, to have caused his death, as the skull was fractured terribly in both places. One wound was on the top of the head—it had completely mashed in the skull—the other was over the eye; and it was thought was produced by Carpenter's falling against the curb-stone, when he was knocked down. His body was found a considerable distance from the lamps; and, from marks upon the clothes, it evidently had been dragged there. A witness stated, that he knew Johnson well; and when he left the hall, he overtook him dragging a man along. He asked Johnson what was the matter, and he replied, he was taking a drunken man home: witness asked if he should help him, and Johnson replied, that he could manage him—witness thought it strange, but passed on. The prisoner had a Mrs. Beazeley called in on his behalf—a young widow of rather doubtful character, who kept as her sign, (probably for fear of mistake,) emphatically said, “A genteel Boardinghouse.” She was dressed very gaudily. Prinky sharp features, and a shrewish eye, which she tried hard to subdue into an expression of amiability, and which was almost hid in the abundance of her curls, appeared under her bonnet, as she timidly removed her veil. The judge was at times a very stern man, and having seen a good deal of the worst of human nature, his tones were, when he thought he had a bad specimen before him in the shape of a witness, keenly peremptory. After trying in vain, with the assistance of his half closed hand applied to his ear, to hear the lady, he exclaimed— “The court can't hear one word you say, madam; you must take off your bonnet.” The widow thought the judge had as full authority in all matters in the court house as she had in her household, and, therefore, dreamed not of disobeying. She started, drew a long breath, and, with trembling hands, took off her bonnet—when, lo! all her curls, being fastened to the side of it, were removed, of course, and the widow stood before the audience with her hair gathered up on the top of her head as tight as it could be drawn—so tight that the bit of red list that bound it, actually drew up her eyebrows, and, as her hair was very short, it stood out from the top of her head, like the scalp lock of a Mohawk. An irresistible burst of laughter broke from every one in the court room; in which the judge could not refrain from joining, while, above the uproar, Nancy, who liked not the widow, was heard to exclaim, “The Lord love us! the vanity of that woman —saw ever a body the like of that? she looks for all the world like the sign of the Ingin, at old Broadbelt's.” The widow glanced round the court, with an eye from which all amiability had fled—it literally flashed fire. When she heard the exclamation of Nancy, her concentrated rage found an object. Shaking her fist at Nancy, while her top-knot shook in unison, she called out, in a voice almost choked with rage, “Yes, you hussy—you hag—I've got as good a head of hair as 'ary lady in this here room. Don't they wear false curls—you—you—you've got no more hair under your old hypocritical, methodist cap, than there is on the back of my hand, and you may thank your sins for it.” Nancy, who was standing on an elevation, within the railing, that extended on each side of the prisoner's box, had tossed up her spectacles to the top of her head—or, as the eloquent biographer of Patrick Henry says, speaking of that orator, when about to say his severest things, she had given them the “war cant,” and placed her arms a-kimbo, in the attitude of making an annihilating reply, when the authoritative voice of the judge instantly restored order, though the eyes of the respective parties still flashed the defiance and retort they dared not utter. The widow replaced her bonnet, and, with a voice tremulous, not with modesty, but with passion, and loud enough, in all conscience, gave in her testimony; which was of an immaterial character. Mr. W—t took two positions, in the defence of the prisoner. First. That, in entering the ball-room, and in arresting any one who was disturbing the peace, the watchman was in the fulfilment of a duty which he was bound to perform; that Carpenter, the deceased, was guilty of a breach of the peace, and that the watchman was bound to take him to the watch-house; that Carpenter resisted his authority, and the watchman had a right to use force; and, if death was the consequence, the act could not be felonious homicide, but was excusable, if not justifiable. Secondly. That, if Johnson had committed any offence, it was not murder, but manslaughter. Mr. W—t dwelt upon these positions with unusual eloquence. Knowing the deep excitement prevailing against the prisoner, he addressed the jury like one under no feeling, one way or the other; but merely as a calm reviewer of the circumstances. It was done with consummate skill. He ridiculed, with great tact, the eves-dropping, as he called it, of Job—and he quoted Scripture against the chaplain. Now and then, a stroke of pathos was thrown in, that touched every heart. While Mr. W—t spoke, Bradshaw's eye was on the jury, with an occasional glance at the audience, then on the jury. Without seeming particularly to observe, he marked every wrinkle on their brows—each compression of the lip. When a juryman altered his position, moved an arm, rubbed his hand through his hair, he noticed whether it was emotion, or the want of it. Notwithstanding Bradshaw's frequent speaking, his practice in public, his schooling in private, his power of self-control, and his perfect knowledge of the case, he felt a tremor in every fibre of his body, when he rose to reply. He saw and understood the impression produced by Mr. W—t, and he was painfully anxious for himself. The idea that he might fail, for a moment swallowed up all his other ideas, like Aaron's serpent. At this instant, he caught the eye of Talbot: an expression lurked in it which he liked not. In a moment, he was the most self-possessed man in the court-house. How much our foes help us on in this world! What they say against us, makes us achieve more than all our friends can say for us. In another moment, Bradshaw forgot every thing but the case. Without any attempt at rhetoric or display—with a bosom almost bursting with the burning thoughts he wished to utter, he calmly and clearly recapitulated the arguments, and examined the positions taken by Mr. W—t. It is not often that the possessor even of great oratorical talents can produce a great effect. He must have a great subject, or have his feelings so interested as to make it great to him. Bradshaw had many motives to exertion, and they all pressed on him with their united weight; but, a few moments after, he forgot them all in the cause—and then his great powers began to develop themselves. Now and then, when he observed the agitation of the prisoner—the gratitude that beamed in the lustrous darkness of Jane Durham's eye—his sister's deep and proudly affectionate regard—Willoughby's and Cavendish's friendliness—Talbot's envy— Mary Carlton's look of delight, her almost tearful joy—and last, though not least, when he marked the fixed, and somewhat agitated, attention of W—t, he thought of himself, of Clinton Bradshaw, and his brow wore the proud consciousness, that Cæsar's might have worn, “the black-eyed Roman, with the eagle's beak,” when, in the forum, he first successfully opposed the veterans who had “Wielded, at will, the fierce democracy;” Or that Chatham's wore, when, notwithstanding “the atrocious crime of being a young man,” he vanquished the veteran debaters. But these feelings were momentary; and, towards the close of his speech, they were merged, lost, overwhelmed, in the cause. Then, every look, tone, gesture, every winged word, breathed, burned with eloquence—every Vol. II. 11 eye was on him—every heart was unconscious of any thing but the emotions which he called up. He described Johnson refusing to get the light—shrinking away from the dead body —in such a manner, that every one was startled with the fear of guilt in his own heart. He denounced his attempt to fix the crime upon Jane Durham, because “she had no friends,” in a voice that swelled, and rolled, and echoed through the court-room, mingling itself with the feelings of the audience, like a trumpet-call to vengeance, in a righteous cause. It sounded like the denouncing spirit's pouring forth the vials of wrath. A wild, unnatural excitement ran through the court—the prisoner started and glared horribly around, as if he thought they meant to seize him. At this moment, Bradshaw exclaimed, in his boldest tone— “What say you—guilty or not guilty?” “Guilty! guilty!” involuntarily burst from the lips of many of the audience, and several of the jury. Bradshaw took his seat. After the lapse of some moments of profound silence, Mr. W—t arose and made a speech on a prayer of instructions, which he offered to the court; not with any hope of having the prayer granted, but for the purpose of giving the jury time to cool from the effects of Bradshaw's eloquence. The judge, in charging the jury, advised them not to make up their minds now, but to retire to their room, and deliberate upon the subject. He defined to them the different degrees of murder, according to the statutory provisions of the state; (the second degree being unknown to the common law,) and he appeared to incline to the opinion that the prisoner's guilt was of the second degree. The jury here retired, and the court adjourned. After the crowd had left the court-room, as Judge Price was passing out, he said to Nancy, with a quiet humour lurking in his mind, but with a face as grave as though he were on the judgment-seat, “Nancy, you literally astonished me to-day. I thought, considering you have been so long about the court-house—acquainted with all the lawyers; going in and out, even of the bar, whenever you chose—a privilege which no other woman is admitted; supplying us all with fruit, and having known us so long, I really thought you felt as high a concernment in the dignity and becoming gravity of the court as though you sat upon the bench—I need not say how much I was mortified to-day!” This was touching Nancy on a tender point:— she had been so long a kind of appendage to the court, that she actually deemed herself necessary to the administration of justice—and though she held herself authorized to say of court and bar what she chose, yet no one could speak disrespectfully of them in her presence, except of Scrags, without being reprimanded—for the judge she had the highest respect, and she therefore replied in the greatest confusion, “The Lord love ye, Judge Price, I never thought at all about it till I said it. I was like the weak old woman that spoke in church—and as soon as she heard herself speak, she called out—`O! I've spoke in church—there, I've spoke agin in church.— And next to speaking in church, is speaking, for a body like me, in the court. Every part and particle that concerns this here court, I feel as if it was my own character; but, the Lord love ye, judge, and be merciful to all of us—this Mistress Beazely, with her Dunstable bonnet and curls—bless me—why she lived with me once; and a pretty trollop she was— ye may swear to it—not worth half as much as my blackey, Beck, if proper conductions is the thing. The trouble I had with her, when she was a girl, was a sin—she flirted about with the fellows—the trollop, jist as bare-faced as she stood in the court to-day, when her bonnet was off; and what modesty she put on was all sham, like her curls, that o'rights belong to some poor dead body. She's an ungrateful cretur, judge. My Beck told me, this very morn, that she heard her tell old Kate—the hussy—that pertends to sell good clean fruit, when she's as dirty as she can be—that she ought to move her table up here to the court, and have a stand by the other door. That's her gratitude, to hurt me in this style. Think of it!—my Beck told me of it this morn, as true as ye're standing there, judge, jist after Mistress Beazely went into court; and she smirked and smiled at me, and talked her prittiest—the varmint—'afore she went in. Who would have thought of her conception? This is a wicked conceptious world! But let old Kate bring her apple-table here! if there ain't a sally, as my first husband used to say, when he talked about the wars, my name's not Nancy.” “Nancy, you've the true spirit of the war in you,” said the judge, laughing; but remember, you and your husband fought on the wrong side.” “'Till we come over to the right, judge! When he left the British, I left them, and we jined the Continentals. They maintained their rights, and so will I, for lawyer Bradshaw; and ye know, yerself, Judge Price, (for I've hearn ye say it,) that no man at this bar has a better head than Bradshaw. He tells me that I'm intitled to sell here, by myself, by a prior right—the right, I think he called it, of description—(prescription.”) “The Judge passed on, saying—“Yes, Nancy, he can give you as good advice as any one. He has managed this case admirably, to-day; but you know I must not say a word about it, as I may have to decide the question of description.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11* CHAPTER V. At night we find Bradshaw alone in his office. I will not go out and see the ladies, thought he, for they may think I came for compliments. “Compliments,” said he, aloud to himself, as he looked through his window, at the court-house opposite, and saw a light shining through the window of the jury-room, notwithstanding the law to the contrary—“this long deliberation looks as if they would be unmerited, if given. Surely, they will not let that scoundrel off. If they do, he may, indeed, consider himself Scot free, at liberty to commit murder and perjury, whenever it pleases him. If he is acquitted, he will be terribly revenged upon Fritz and Jane Durham, in some way or other. He would make a bold blow at me, if he dare; but that he won't dare, unless he could take a bond of fate. No! no! I indulge no ill feelings against such as he, but he ought to be convicted—something must be done for his wife and family, if he is—yes, and he ought to be convicted on the first count. Our juries, here, are so tender in these cases, that they scarcely ever bring in the verdict that justice requires. If he escapes, he may thank Mr. W—t for it. By Jove! he's every inch a lawyer and an orator. The blues! the blues!—I have the blues, like all wrath, as Kentuck would say.” Here he heard a rap at his door, which he had locked. He descended the steps, (both the rooms were occupied by him—the lawyer who formerly occupied the room below having taken another office,) opened the door, and Selman entered. “Ah! Selman, is it you? Come in? I hav'n't seen you for some days.” “I saw you in the court to-day, but not to speak to you,” said Selman. They were soon seated in Bradshaw's office, the same in which we had the pleasure of introducing them to our readers. Selman's face was considerably elongated beyond its wont, and, after seating himself, he gazed abstractedly at the lamps. “Bradshaw,” he at length said, “I am used up, a gone case, tetotally gone.” “What's the matter, my dear fellow?” “The public dinner to Clinton Bradshaw, Esq., has knocked me into a cocked hat—into the middle of next week.” “How so?” “How so. I've been round here several times to see you, Bradshaw, and ask your advice, but you were out. You're the only man that I can confide to on this subject. Why, Cavendish is such an odd fish, and so cynical, and so little calculated to give advice, that I wouldn't dream of speaking to him; he thinks so little about women, that I do believe he holds every fellow a born fool that is troubled about them. And there's Kentuck—he's a first rate fellow; but he'd laugh outright if I were to tell him of the infernal fix I've got into; so I've just kept it until I saw you.” “Why, what's the matter?” “I've got my walking papers, with a vengeance!” “The devil! How did that happen? I remember when I saw you at the ball—you were carrying every thing before you,” said Bradshaw, with a look that he had hard work to keep in proper sympathy with Selman's. “The day of the dinner, I got high, you know, very high—dirn it. Well, after you left, I staid there with the Judge and Kentuck till after dark— and then, as the devil would have it; when wine's in, wit's out—as the devil would have it, I went round to Mr. Perry's. There was Miss Penelope with Bates: the fool sticks to her as if he had a right to her. The family were all out but she. I took a seat, and being in high glee, I ran on like a mill-clapper—told all about the dinner—a whole rigmarole about Miss Durham and you—and about you, Willoughby, and Adams. I don't know what I didn't say, hardly, or what I did. After telling all this, and cutting at Bates, (for I wanted to drive him off, or out set him,) I felt a little sobered down, that's a fact, but still high. I didn't get to the corner of the street, above Perry's, before Bates past me. He left just after me—he had determined to set me out, you see. I walked slow, and when Bates got out of sight, I turned round and walked back towards the house. I thought it would be a first rate chance to see Miss Penelope, and speak right out to her on the subject.” “What subject, Selman?” “Why of my attachment—what other subject had I to speak to her upon. When I drew near the door, I thought it wouldn't do, and I determined that I'd just pass by,—but, as bad luck would have it,—you know it was a beautiful night—Miss Penelope was standing at her door. As soon as she saw me advancing towards her, she turned to go in; I was by her side in a moment; handed her into the room. She looked serious, but I didn't think of it at the time. To make a long story short, I let the cat out of the bag; made a plump declaration, and she plumply rejected me with the dignity of a tragedy queen. Think of that, Bradshaw, and of your penetration. You told me, a long time ago, you thought she liked me.” “What did she say to you?” “Say to me!—why, I told her of my attachment, and asked her if I might dare hope for a return, and she told me I could not, and that my conduct on that evening was sufficient to determine her, even though she had previously entertained other sentiments towards me; she up and told me, that she didn't think I was aware of my situation, and she advised me the next time I dined out, to stay out. Her very words, by Jove!” “Did you leave, then?” “Leave then; no! I did my best to apologize, and told her that I might be a little excited, but no more. `No more!' said she; `why, Mr. Bates observed it the moment you left here.' Bradshaw, oughtn't I to give Bates a kicking?” “What else said Miss Penelope?” “Why, I did all I could to get her to retract; but she wouldn't. She said, at last, though she could not receive me as a suiter, she would always be glad to see me as a friend. As a friend—think of that, Bradshaw, that's always the word when a fellow gets his walking papers. The fact is, in these times of saving girls in alleys, men at fires, and making great speeches, a man of only reasonable sense is a mere circumstance with the women. Did you ever know a fellow to be in just such a fix as I am?” “Often—it's one of the commonest things in the world.” “Bradshaw, you know my condition at the dinner. I was not very high, was I?” “You were elevated a little.” “Well, I believe I was. When I was running on before Bates, I thought I had the world in a sling—but I was about the soberest man you ever saw when I left there the second time. I was sobered instanter—I came round here to have a talk with you about it; but you were not in. What do you think of it, Bradshaw?” “Selman, you don't believe in poetry, and hate quotations, yet I think Mazeppa's remark—the hero whose wild ride Byron so gloriously describes— applies to your case: “ `Who listens once, will listen twice, Her heart, besure, is not of ice, And one refusal's no rebuff.' Don't be cast down, Selman; Rome was not built in a day. Miss Penelope likes you, my dear fellow. She was provoked that Bates should have seen you excited, for you know she has a high notion of womanly propriety, and of the respect due from a lover. If Bates, now, had been tipsy, she would probably have laughed at him.” “Bradshaw, that's a fact,—he did go home with her high from a party; and I heard her telling your sister and Miss Carlton of it; and she ridiculed him without mercy. I wonder if she told of my being tipsy.” “I hav'n't heard that she did.” “Bradshaw, I wish you would see her, and speak to her on the subject. You know I wasn't very high at the dinner—and I swear to you I didn't drink one drop after I left there. I determined to see Bates, and kick him like thunder; but when I came to think upon it, it occurred to me every body would inquire into the fuss, and it would go all over town, that I was as drunk as a fool, and kicked Bates for telling; and it might bring Miss Penelope's name in it.” “What shall I say to Miss Penelope?” “Just what you would say for yourself, if you were in such a fix.” “Well, I will do so, if you think it will be of any service to you; but don't be too much in the dumps. Come, let us go into the Restaurateur, and have some Champagne and oysters.” “I've sworn off from drinking,” said Selman, “but I'll take some oysters.” Bradshaw smiled— “You think it's shutting the stable, after the horse is gone—do you?” “I think you will be able to catch the filly yet. I will drink to your success in sparkling Champagne.” “ `The spring dew of the spirit, the heart's rain;' and you shall pledge me in cool water, or hot coffee, and I'll tell Miss Penelope of the sternness of your resolutions. Ah! there they are hanging at it yet,” said Bradshaw, looking up at the jury-room, as they passed out of his office. They entered the oyster house, and were soon comfortably seated in one of the boxes, with the curtains drawn, discussing their oysters. In a few minutes, two persons entered the oyster house, in conversation. Bradshaw's love of approbation became more active than his alimentiveness, to speak phrenologically, when he heard a person whom he knew, by his voice, to be Bates, ask, “Mr. Talbot, how did you like the speeches, sir?” “Mr. W—t's was a great effort,” said Talbot; “and I wonder how the jury can deliberate so long—he made out a plain case of excusable homicide: his compliment to Bradshaw was rather poetical—very poetical; poets deal best in fiction: and as for Bradshaw's reply, I do assure you, Mr. Bates, I have heard him and others make a better speech at our debating society. That long compliment to W—t, though it may all be true, was very fulsome to a man's face; but, I suppose, as Mr. W—t had condescended to tickle Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. Bradshaw was, in duty, bound to do his best to tickle Mr. W—t. Did you ever hear any thing like that long puff upon woman? I thought he would never get through with it (“ha! ha! ha!” laughed Mr. Bates.) Now, that was outrageous, in a court of justice, in a case of such interest to a fellow being.” “A man hears truth from his enemies,” whispered Bradshaw to Selman. “Don't you think so?” continued Talbot to Bates. “Decidedly so, sir; decidedly so,” said Mr. Bates. “Did you observe how Bradshaw acted the interesting, when he commenced his speech? His blood's as cold as an iceberg—he has more stage trick in him than any man I ever knew—he does every thing for effect. It was all done to please the ladies.” “I was surprised to hear W—t speak so highly of his speech,” said Bates. “O! he's bound, in gratitude, to do so—and the dear creatures will puff it, too, no doubt. He showed so much chivalry, in rescuing the girl from her paramour! I wonder what could have taken him to — lane at such an hour? I had no idea he frequented such places. What did Mr. W—t say of him?” “High compliments: that his sagacity—that was the word he used—struck him as much as his eloquence; and that he must have studied hard, and practised speaking a great deal: he praised his gentlemanly manners, too.” “Manners! it's all manners with him,” exclaimed Talbot. “Mr. Talbot,” said Bates, “I wish you had been at Mr. Perry's the other evening, the day of the dinner to Bradshaw. Selman, who assumes to be Vol. II. 12 a suiter to Miss Penelope, came there gloriously drunk, and behaved in a manner worthy of the company in which he became inebriated.” “I'll make him eat his words,” whispered Selman to Bradshaw, rising. “Wait a moment,” whispered Bradshaw, “till they get deep into the narrow passage—we'll make them back out, as a drayman makes his horse back out of a narrow alley, with one hand on their throats and the rod in terrorem.” “I don't think much, between ourselves,” said Talbot to Bates, “of the sobriety or morality of either the orator or his friend.” The next moment, Bradshaw, who had taken the whole bottle of Champagne, and Selman stood before them. Bradshaw, with folded arms, endeavouring to suppress his passion, faced Talbot, without saying a word. “Listeners hear no good of themselves, Mr. Bradshaw,” said Talbot, in much confusion. “But sir, they have power to redress the evil,” said Bradshaw, with an ominous calmness. “Help me! help me! Mr. Talbot,” called out Bates, in a smothered voice,—for Selman had knocked him down;—and, while one hand grasped his collar, he was doing his best with the other, in the shape of a clenched fist, to revenge not only his wrongs of this night; but, also, all he had suffered from Miss Penelope's frown. “Selman! Selman!” exclaimed Bradshaw, taking hold of him, “you are stronger than Mr. Bates.” At this moment, while Bradshaw stooped to take Selman from Bates, Talbot, who stood over them, aimed a dastardly kick at the head of Selman, which might have spoilt for ever, the good looks of the lover of Miss Penelope, had not Bradshaw, who had his eye on Talbot, caught his leg in such a manner as to throw him on the floor. Talbot's head struck a chair as he fell. Starting up, nearly maddened with mortification and pain, he seized a poker from the stove; and made at Bradshaw, with a fell determination. Bradshaw, since the affair in the lane with Adams, had gone armed, suspecting that he might be assaulted by some of Adams's gang, at night: as Talbot advanced, he drew a pistol, and aiming it directly at him, said— “Keep cool, Mr. Talbot; this is a business, sir, not to be settled with the weapon of Baillie Nicol Jarvie—you had better put down your poker— you are the aggressor, remember.” As Bradshaw spoke, he returned the pistol to his pocket, and Talbot threw down the poker. In the mean time, Bates had escaped from the clutches of Selman, and rushed to the stove: though the temperature without was warm, that within required a fire. Unmindful of this, Bates in his rage seized from the top of the stove, a hot brick, with the intention of hurling it at the head of Selman, but he dropped it instantly, parting at the same time with all the skin from the palm of his hand. He danced about in agony, blowing and shaking the afflicted member. Selman, whose good humour returned the moment he saw the discomfiture of his rival, advised him to bathe it in brandy. During the fracas, the proprietor of the restaureteur was not silent, “Gentlemen! gentlemen! do keep the peace,” he exclaimed, while, “like a fawning publican,” he took care to say or do nothing to offend any body. “Mr. Talbot,” said Bradshaw, “you are aware, sir, that we were no eaves-droppers—we unintentionally heard what you said. You seemed disregardless who heard you, for you pronounced your opinions in a public bar-room. I am not quarrelling with what opinions you may be pleased to entertain of my abilities; but, sir, those which you expressed of my `sobriety and morality,' involve my character—and, sir, I must have satisfaction.” “I did not speak for you to hear,” said Talbot; “and I did not speak publicly—for there were none in the room, but Mr. Bates and myself, that I knew of.” “This is trifling, sir. I expect you to say that you have no foundation whatever for the remarks you made, concerning my character—that you acted improperly in”— “I shall say no such thing, sir,” said Talbot. “Then, sir, now is as good a time as any. Mr. Bates will, I have no doubt, act as your friend: Mr. Selman will be mine. Let me prevent interruption, sir.” So saying, Bradshaw walked to the front door, which was of glass, to which five or six steps descended from the street, and fastened it. The landlord here remonstrated. “Don't be alarmed, Joe,” said Bradshaw to him, for he knew him very well. “If I should be hit, you can take me to my office, which is only a few doors off— and it is at Mr. Talbot's service. You may consider me the challenger, (he continued, addressing Talbot.) Here are weapons, sir, (laying a pair of pistols before him on a table)—how shall we fire?” “Why, gentlemen, you are not a going to murder each other in my house, are you?” exclaimed the astonished landlord. “Keep cool, Joe; no murder, man,” said Bradshaw. Here the efforts of some one trying to open the door, through the glass of which, the parties could be distinctly seen, though not without descending the steps, was heard, and a voice exclaimed— “Halloo! what are you after? Bradshaw let me in.” Talbot, holding one of the pistols in his hand, said—“Mr. Bradshaw, you are a better shot than I.” “Not at all, sir,” said Bradshaw. “I'm told you can snuff a candle. I never yet performed that fete. Wait a moment, Kentuck, (addressing the person at the door, who was Willoughby, and who was calling on them to open the door,) wait a moment, and I'll let you in.” Willoughby here broke a pane of glass, and thrusting his head through, exclaimed—“What are you after; are you going to fight? Bradshaw, what's got into you?” “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Talbot, “open the door, sir, and let Mr. Willoughby in—he is a gentleman, and if you are agreed, we will abide by what he advises in this case.” 12* “With all my heart, sir,” said Bradshaw. Bradshaw turned and proceeded to the door: as he undid it, the report of the pistol in Talbot's hand was heard, and the ball shattered a pane of glass above his head, and so near to it that the ball grazed his hair. “Mr. Talbot did you fire, sir?” exclaimed Willoughby in astonishment, as he hurried into the room. “I—I, fire, sir, certainly not, the pistol went off accidentally as I was putting it down. It did not go off in your direction, did it?” “Rather in Bradshaw's; it hit just over his head as you may see,” said Willoughby, pointing to the shattered glass. “It went off entirely accidentally, I assure you. Were you observing me, sir?”—to the landlord. The publican protested he was looking at Bradshaw. “Were you, Mr. Selman?” “No, sir,” said Selman, when Bradshaw turned to go to the door, “I turned to look at Mr. Bates's hand.” Mr. Bates vowed that he looked only at his hand. Bradshaw observed Talbot steadily, for a moment, and then said,—“Mr. Talbot, will you state the history of this business to Mr. Willoughby?” Several persons passing—attracted by the report of the pistol—had entered the house, and the young men retired to a private room; where Talbot made an ample apology to Bradshaw and Selman; the latter would have forgotten to require one from Bates, had not a private hint from Talbot reminded him of it. All having professed themselves satisfied, wine was ordered, and after they had pledged each other, Bates and Talbot withdrew. “Let's have some more wine,” exclaimed Willoughby, after Talbot and Bates had left. “Bradshaw, you were for doing things in Kentuck style, hey! And Selman went old Kentuck, too. Selman, you've made Bates's eyes look like the bow of promise—of all colours. He'll not be able to make his appearance for three or four weeks; his hand may be said to be branded by the precipitancy of his valour. I would commend the painter to his phiz, for the expression of unutterable wo. I wish the Judge had been here; he has missed a circumstance.” “Though I had my dander up when Bates called for help, I could not but smile to see the tireless, rapid energy with which Selman pounded him. He seemed like a man working by the job, who was trying his best to see how much he could accomplish in the shortest possible time,” said Bradshaw. “Ha! ha!” said Kentuck, “good—and then you tell me the moment he burnt his hand, Selman played the good Samaritan, and offered to pour oil on the wound, in the shape of brandy. Selman, I like you for that, my old boy—that's the true grit—come, here's to you. May Miss Penelope Perry—why don't you fill up your glass?” “Thank you, Kentuck—I've a bad headach.” “But you'll like the toast, Selman.” “I believe I'll treat resolution,” whispered Selman to Bradshaw; and forthwith, with a merry eye, he drank Willoughby's sentiment, that expressed the hope nearest to his heart. All at once, recollecting that he had a particular appointment, which he should have kept an hour before, with much reluctance, Selman departed. “Bradshaw,” said Kentuck, when they were left alone, “keep your eye on Talbot. It's no use, perhaps, to blab a mere suspicion of a man; but that pistol went off because the trigger was pulled. It's a damning thing to say of any man; and of a man of such respectable connexions it ought not to be said for their sakes, if it could be helped. There's no proof of it—but, keep your eye on him. I was in the act of seizing him by the throat, and charging him with the intention of shooting you; but it is too much, too much to say of any man who is respectable, unless you have strong proof of it.” “I'm satisfied,” said Bradshaw, “he meant to shoot. There was guilt in his eye—he would not look at me. As you say, there is no use to say any thing about it. I saw that Bates, Selman, and Joe all suspected him—let him run—I determined not to speak of it until you spoke. He's much less pluck than I thought he had, Kentuck.” “I thought once he had pluck; but, whew! it was rather tough to hear him tell over all he had said behind your back, as he thought, and then to make that humble apology—but a man who will fire at another's back will do any thing to avoid facing him.” “Come, let's go to my office and smoke a cigar; I have some very superior ones, presented to me by old Broadbelt.” They accordingly left the oyster-house. When they got opposite the court-house door, Bradshaw saw Nancy, by the light of a dark lantern which she held, in the act of fastening a large tin kettle to a string which was lowered from the window of the jury-room, where the jury were still locked up, unable to agree on their verdict. In an instant the kettle rapidly ascended, and the window was let down. “Ah, Nancy, is that you,” said Bradshaw. Nancy spoke not until she reached them; when, holding the light to their faces, she exclaimed— “Ah, is it ye, honies? Ye see, Bradshaw, the jury must have the creature comforts. I never could make out the sense of the law that keeps them there without food—but I suppose they'll make their minds up quicker.” “Nancy, what will be the verdict of the jury, do you think?” “Why, honey,” said Nancy, whispering, “do ye see, I jist a little after dark, in sweeping out the passage by the jury-room—Josey, ye know, has the rheumatiz, and can't attend—in sweeping out by their door I heard 'em counting how they stood. There was one for letting him off; three for manslaughter, and eight for murder. I could tell by their talk, Bradshaw, that his treatment of the poor thing, Jane Durham, and his trying to get old Moll to parjure herself—and his parjuring himself, was the thing that made again him. Ye may depend, honey, ye spoke jist right on them pints— you made the people feel that Johnson deserved hanging—and, honey, he'll hang, ye may depend.” Nancy here went on her way, and the young men were soon seated in Bradshaw's office. “Talbot's enmity to me,” said Bradshaw, musingly, “arose, I suspect, from that little affair in our debating society, when I defended Jekyl from his sarcastic allusions to his trade. Jekyl is getting on well with his paper, Kentuck. He has been editing it for some time, and he improves very much. He is decidedly a man of talents, and has quite a turn for politics.” “Yes,” said Willoughby, “he is a man of strong mind, and a heart true in every beat.” “I took tea with him the other day, and spent all the evening with him. There he was, when I called, seated in a neat but plain room, at a table, not with his papers scattered about every way, as you would suppose from his former slovenly habits, but folded up neatly. His chin was new-reaped, his hair tastefully combed, his shirt collar clean,—his strong, iron features never looked so well. By his side was his wife, one of the neatest little women you ever saw; not what you would call handsome, but pretty—and with an intelligent expression, that makes her look, when animated and pleased, really fascinating. She's proud of him, and he's proud of her. I left there, and, at the fashionable hour, entered Mr. Jones's fashionable party, and grew at outs with the gay world, and all thereunto belonging. I have the blues, to-night, as badly as a moonstruck poet.” “No wonder!—a man who has been through so much excitement as you have lately; and,” continued Willoughby, smiling, “a man who keeps all his passions down with the rein and bit, except his ambition, must expect the blues, as you call them—particularly, if he has such strong passions, in other respects, as a certain friend of mine, they will get the bit between their teeth, sometimes, and bound away. Bradshaw, I hold the heart is a democracy of many passions—and they must rule together, and upon republican principles, to make a man happy. If one passion obtains the mastery, it becomes a tyrant; and the rest, though kept down for awhile, will become turbulent and disorderly—while the frame, like the country in which the invader has been resisted, is wasted and worn. Don't you think so?” “It's not a bad notion; and I suppose, therefore, Cassius was `lean and hungry.”'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The next morning, near eleven o'clock, the jury having agreed upon their verdict, left their rooms, and pronounced Johnson guilty of the murder. By the exertions of Bradshaw, a considerable sum of money was raised, by subscription, for his wife and daughter, with which they opened a shop. The profits arising therefrom, together with what they received for the sewing they took in, enabled them to live much more comfortably than they ever had before—for they not only had more means, but they were relieved from the brutality of the watchman. Bradshaw had frequently called to inquire how Mr. Glassman was, and learned he was getting better, slowly; but his physicians deemed it unadvisable for him to see his friends, as yet. At last, Jane Durham, who had left the prison, and was living in her house, near Glassman's, told Bradshaw Mr. Glassman wished to see him so much, his physicians had consented. Bradshaw found Glassman, wan and weak, sitting up in bed. “Give me your hand, Bradshaw,” said Glassman. “I have heard all that has happened, since I have been ill, from Miss Durham. Fortune seems determined I shall be indebted to you, my friend. Let me say it, Bradshaw, there lives not the man to whom I would rather be under obligations. I have but a poor return to make, but `I will wear you in my heart of hearts,' as Hamlet did Horatio, with more even than a woman's disinterestedness. I have been like the navigator who approaches the whirlpool, and who feels too full a confidence in his skill, duly to weigh the difficulties that encompass him. You see me what I am—no matter—my race is ending; and I cannot retrace it, and start again. Come, take a seat—a fig for this sentimentality. Drop me a few drops of laudanum. You look a little thinner than when I saw you last. The stir, excitement, and, particularly, the intellectual strife of life, don't fatten a man.” Bradshaw soon left Glassman, fearing that conversation would debilitate him. As the spring advanced, Bradshaw frequently rode out with his friend, and they often visited the Purchase, where Glassman would remain, sometimes, for several days. The healthy situation and the quiet scene did much to recruit him. The inmates of the Purchase could not but feel deeply interested in him, and he felt he breathed a healthier moral as well as physical atmosphere with them. Bradshaw was now admitted to practise in the civil court, and he commenced, not like other young men who have the practice to learn after they have become practitioners; but with a knowledge of it, which he had acquired by great attention in the office Vol. II. 13 where he was a student, and by frequent attendance in court. He did not visit the court, like many other students, to while away the hour in careless conversation, but to learn his profession. He jested and talked as gaily as any of them, when nothing particular occupied the attention of the bar, and when he did there was generally a group around him; but as soon as a case of importance was called up, he would quietly steal away from his companions, take a favourable position, and hear and see every thing relative to it. After he had heard the speeches of counsel, he would often shut himself up in his office, and make a speech, first on one side, and then the other. He would try to present the facts in a more striking light, and illustrate the law with better analogies. In a lovely dell, not far from the Purchase, through which the stream, of which we have spoken, passed, in the quiet summer, Bradshaw would frequently wander, and build an argument upon any subject that occurred to him. A passionate lover of poetry, he would recite the best passages from his favourite authors, with as much attention to the emphasis and gesture as if he were preparing himself for the stage. As the fourth of July drew near, the committee selected by the citizens to make arrangements for celebrating the day, appointed Bradshaw the orator, and Talbot to read the Declaration of Independence. Talbot, who was a man of talents, and both emulous and envious, with more reasons than one for disliking Bradshaw, determined to forestall his oration, by making one himself in the nature of prefatory remarks to the Declaration of Independence. What he said was well said, and well written; but, Talbot, though his manner was insinuating and distinct, had not the “power of speech to stir men's blood.” Bradshaw possessed it, and he had prepared himself with great care. His oration was all before him, and he had it in his heart, as well as head. Just before he arose, the martial music filled every cranny of the immense church in which they were celebrating the day, and gave him that enthusiastic excitement so necessary for one to produce an effect on such an occasion, and which one of his temperament would be likely to feel, under such circumstances; the more particularly, when in the great crowd, he not only recognised many of his acquaintances of both sexes, but also, in the soldierly array, many veterans who had distinguished themselves in the late war. Some of the banners so tastefully arranged, had not always floated on a holiday; they bore plainly, perceptible to all, the marks of stern encounters. Bradshaw alluded to the veterans, to the well fought field, in which they had triumphed, to the banners that then waved over them in glorious war, and now waved over them in glorious peace, so eloquently, that the whole audience, by one impulse arose, and gave three cheers of enthusiastic approbation. “It's no use,” said Talbot to himself, “for any one to attempt to compete with Bradshaw, in producing a mere theatrical effect, he's always tickling the ears of the groundlings.” In the afternoon, a large party of gentlemen, among whom were Bradshaw, Willoughby, &amp;c., accompanied by the ladies, made an excursion on the river, (we will say, if our readers please.) They glided delightfully along. Halleck has beautifully described similar scenery— “Tall spire, and glittering roof, and battlement, And banners floating in the sunny air, And white sails o'er the calm blue waters bent; Green isles, and circling shores, are blended there In wild reality!” They had a fine band of music on board; and beholding such scenes, in such company, on such a day, it may be supposed there was general pleasure. “I like this scene,” said Willoughby, with enthusiasm, to Bradshaw, his sister, and Miss Carlton. “One of the prettiest scenes I know of, approaching this character, strange as it may seem to you, is in the west. Stand in Cincinnati, on the landing, in a clear summer's sun-set, and look over the river on Newport, opposite. The Licking river flows into the Ohio, dividing Newport and Covington. In the angle formed on the Newport side, stands the arsenal, one of the earliest brick buildings in all that region. A tall flag-staff, immediately on the bank of the river, on the point, bears our banner— the stars and stripes. A hill, covered with trees, lays behind Newport, and gradually slopes down to the plain, on which the little town stands. The houses are, mostly, white, and they have many trees beside them; and you see very few persons walking about. It appears so still, and contrasts so strangely with the landing on which you stand, full of bustle and business! Your eye glances from the busy scene around you, from the river which darkly rolls,—for it lies in shadow,—to the sleeping flag, with its ample folds hanging calmly down, (`a metaphor of peace,' as Shelley says,) the arsenal, the town, the trees, the hill—all lit up with the golden splendour of the setting sun. It gives a tint of poetry to every thing, and flings a rainbow radiance on the clouds. Perhaps a hawk circles over all, and you hear the evening drum-beat of the soldiers. As the sun sinks behind Cincinnati, the shadow from the river lengthens, gradually moving up the bank, with insidious progress, until the golden tints pass away from the houses and trees of Newport; and, after lingering a moment among the foliage, on the hill-top, fade into twilight. I have often thought,” continued Willoughby, turning to Miss Bradshaw, “when I've looked upon the scene, that the time would come when it would be celebrated in songs of love and chivalry. Why not? It is beautiful, too, by moonlight. Those rivers, between the towns, will make them, not exactly a Venice, a city of the sea, but they may make them a city of the rivers; and, then, with the addition of a few canals, many a gondolier may `softly wake the tide.' Let me see—would it be better for a lady to live down or up the river, from her lover?” “Up,” said Bradshaw; “because to row to her would be considered no pain—but who would like to row from her, when the interview was over? It would be struggling, not only against your own inclinations, but against the stream—strong, both, against you. Leander leaped, no doubt, with an exulting bound, into the Hellespont, when he went 13* to meet Hiero: but the returning, Kentuck, the returning! I should think, unless the wave bore him from the shore, he would often let it bear him back.” “O! no, Mr. Clinton,” said Mary Carlton—“she had better live down the stream, because, going up, the oars would be heard; and, remember the song— “`—So softly wake the tide, That not an ear on earth may hear, But hers, to whom we glide.”' “True, Mary; you are right. I suppose the lady might have a double motive for living down, not only that he might `wake the tide' softly, in going, but that the tide might keep him.” “I suppose such a wish might glance across her mind,” replied Miss Carlton, archly, “if he were a favourite lover.” “Then, if I were a favourite lover,” said Bradshaw, “that tide in the affairs of men, I would take at the flood.” “Because it leads on to fortune,” whispered the Judge, who was in one of his cynical moods, to Willoughby. They landed at a place celebrated in the late war, where the captain of the boat had an excellent collation spread for them. After partaking of it, they sang, recited, and enjoyed themselves in various ways. Selman and Miss Penelope were of the party. The former took Bradshaw by the arm, and they walked aside: when they were out of hearing of the rest, Selman said, “Bradshaw, I wish my dear friend, if you get a chance, you would just take a walk with Miss Penelope, and speak to her on that subject.” “Where were you, Selman, all the way on the boat?” “Why,” said Selman, “since that affair with Bates, Miss Penelope has treated me very well, considering: and I was to call, and escort her to the steamboat. Bradshaw, to tell the truth, that blue coat of mine was too informal shabby. I went, last week, to Jemmy Dobson—he's a lying rascal; I'll never get another coat from him as long as I live —and got measured for a coat and pants, upon the promise that he would let me have them early this morning, without fail. After he promised me, I just wore my blue one any where; and yesterday afternoon, near dark, going down the court house lane, Kentuck passed me; I threw a rotten apple, that Nancy had thrown out, after him, and he—I hate such jokes—seized a bunch of those little yellow candles from a fellow's pole, who was passing —such roughness is just like a Kentuckian—and took me right in the back. I never thought of sending my coat to have it taken out. This morning—Dobson didn't send home my coat—I had nothing to wear to hear the oration. I had to slip round to his shop: I found him going out, and I insisted upon his finishing my coat. I'd have knocked him down, if he hadn't. I was at his infernal shop for three hours—and I was too late to see Miss Penelope to the boat. It's a ridiculous business, any how; but, you know, Bradshaw, serious things often grow out of such affairs. When I came on board, Miss Penelope spoke to me, and that's all. I thought, at first, she meant to cut me dead. I couldn't rally my spirits, so I laid down in one of the berths.” “That coat fits well, Selman. Jemmy Dobson is a good fit.” “Do you think it fits me well?” said Selman, with a pleased smile, eyeing the garment. “Yes; very. Brummel himself would pronounce it the thing.” “I hoped it would fit me. The coat itself cost me thirty-five dollars, and I gave fifteen for the pants. Jemmy is a good cut, that's a fact, but, Bradshaw, he's the greatest liar living. I felt like the devil, though, when I got to the boat—she was just starting: I was all of a perspiration, and I had to make pretty much of a jump, to reach her.” “I didn't see you come on board.” “No! I saw you, and Willoughby, and Cavendish standing together; and I thought Willoughby would blow me about the candles. Cavendish would harp at it for ever. You know, Bradshaw, this ridicule knocks a fellow all into a cocked hat with the women. Since I blacked Bates' eyes, I tell you, he's a case. Dern it, just as I think I've got every thing right, something or other happens, and uses me up—the way I've been bedeviled is a caution. Do you think she likes me, Bradshaw?” “Yes, I do.” “By gracious! I don't know what to think of it. The women have all got crazy with you and Willoughby, lately—particularly with you, this girl, the fire, and your speeches. I wish I could get a chance of achieving something—I'd risk my life to do it. I'm actually tired with hearing Miss Penelope dwell, dwell, dwell upon these things all the time—it strikes me, sometimes, she's talking at me.” “Have you spoken to Miss Penelope since we've been here?” “Yes—I asked her if I should help her, at the table. Bradshaw, if you get a chance, do take a walk, and speak to her on the subject. Don't go out of sight, Bradshaw; and, if it's favourable, just take off your hat, and I'll join you.” “Well, there's Miss Penelope now. I'll ask her to take a walk with me—if she does, you must keep your eye on us, Selman—and join us, if I take off my hat. Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, addressing the lady, “will you walk in the woods? I'll show you the marks of the bullets in the trees: allow me to cut one of them out for you. It is appropriate, on this day, to obtain a memorial of the battle.” The lady took Bradshaw's arm, and they walked through the woods. “How changed is this scene,” said Bradshaw, “from that when the two contending armies were here fighting for victory or death.” “Yes,” said Penelope, “I've been thinking of it ever since we've been here. I never see Mrs. Glover, but I think of the battle and her husband, who was killed in it.” “Colonel Glover? Yes, I've heard of him— though she looks care-worn, and is not young, she is still beautiful.' “Yes, very. Don't you know it was a love-match? She really mourns for him.” “Yes, there's every thing to hallow such an attachment. He was so young, so kind-hearted, so brave. Not very far from here, in an open space, beneath a tree, is a beautiful little monument erected on the spot where he fell, and where they buried him. There are many like him—I'm told he was one of the most sensitive lovers you ever heard of—a frown from her moved him more than the front of battle. It's always so with such natures. There was a great deal of artlessness in his character. She, I dare swear, caused him many an anxious hour—nay, many an anxious week, or month, perhaps, or year, before she said yes to him.” “It's a lady's privilege, Mr. Bradshaw—they have to yield in every thing afterwards, and for my part,” continued Miss Penelope, laughing—“I think, while we have the power, we ought to exercise it.” “To inflict a wound, Miss Penelope?” “Oh! but it is so delightful to cure it.” “But, do not ladies inflict such wounds, sometimes merely to show their skill in love's archery—and, though they mean to be merciful—remember, a deep wound never closes without a scar.” “Deep wounds! Mr. Bradshaw, you don't think such wounds are deep, do you?” “Yes, Miss Penelope, in a sensitive nature deeper than you imagine. A man who really loves, is always painfully sensitive—and the exhibition of such sensitiveness is always a proof of attachment. A man of the world, who woos a lady merely for the worldly advantages that such a connexion would give him, never shows any sensitiveness. He courts as he gambles; he looks upon both as a game in which the loss of self-possession would endanger his success. No! no! sensitiveness is a proof of attachment. You ladies, laugh in the plenitude of your power, and say, you would inflict the wound; but I know you would not, Miss Penelope—your gentle nature would not let you.” Miss Penelope made no reply, but walked on, musingly. “Colonel Glover fell near here, I believe,” said Bradshaw. “Well, we have all to die—and dying on the battle-field is a death to be coveted. In these times of peace, a man, however brave, may whistle for glory. There is many a man whose courage is only known in his resenting a private indignity—a falsehood; who, in the hour of battle, would have won the laurel. Come, Miss Penelope, will you rest upon this moss? How beautiful! How velvet-like! at the foot of this old oak. It was a witness of the battle, and there is glory in its shade.” Bradshaw spread his handkerchief for Miss Penelope, and threw himself at her feet. He was getting matters in a favourable train for discovering the real state of her feelings towards her lover, without awakening her suspicion of his intentions. He had no doubt of her partiality for Selman, but he wished to discover its extent before he spoke to her of his “infernal fix,” to use her lover's own expression. But poor Selman, who had been on the rack all the time they were walking,—which seemed to him an hour,—when he beheld Bradshaw with his hat on his head, as tight as if it were nailed there, throw himself at the lady's feet beneath the oak with an easy air, and with a proximity which he himself would not have dared to assume, could stand it no longer. The green-eyed monster in his bosom gave himself, like the lap dog in the Rape of the Lock, on a momentous occasion, the “rousing shake.” He advanced towards them with a hesitating step and an embarrassed look, affecting not to know they were there, but his spirit failed him when he drew near them, and he stopped and turned his ear in their direction, with the vain hope of hearing what they said, while he pretended to be engaged in contemplating the party he had left. “Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, “there's Selman—he's brave, generous, intelligent, and he loves the very ground you tread upon—shall I call him. Sel—” “No, no, I insist you do not, Mr. Bradshaw,” said the lady, in a low voice, deeply blushing. O! where did you buy that summer hat?—it's made of strange straw; let me look at it.” “Miss Penelope, Selman loves you with a devotion that has never been surpassed—he has loved you for years, unchangeably—he made me his confidant, and requested me to speak to you on the subject—I have no skill in the gentle art, lady; but I smiled, and told him that if I thought his suit propitious, I would take off my hat!” Bradshaw handed his hat to Miss Penelope. As she was studying the plats of the straw with great diligence he called out to Selman— “Selman, lend me your knife, will you? I want to cut a bullet from the tree.” Selman turned, and with no slight degree of alacrity, hastened to give his knife to Bradshaw. “Confound it!” said Bradshaw, “I thought that knot was a bullet mark—there are a great many in the woods. Miss Penelope, I am determined you shall have a testimonial of the battle;”—and leaving his hat in her hand, and Selman by her side, he walked away as if in search of one. When Bradshaw had advanced some little distance in the wood, he turned round, and with a peculiar smile observed the pair he had left. Selman had taken his place at Miss Penelope's feet, but at a more awful distance than he himself had occupied—the lady still held his hat, from which he judged, by the turn of her head, she cast frequent sly looks at Selman. “Selman's a man of good sense,” said Bradshaw to himself; “but who hearing him discourse of his passion, and his tribulations, would suspect him of it? Well, it's no great shame for any one to play the fool in love, for it has made fools of the wisest— and such fools! If Selman knew the passage, he might rant with Castalio against the sex. How he hates quotations!—he's no verbal memory, and I suspect has worried himself not a little in attempting to commit the tender beauties of the poets. It's wrong to tease him; for though this love does make a fool of him, he suffers none the less,—the more rather, as he has an inkling of the fact himself. He has less tact than any biped I ever saw:—that tact's a marvellous proper thing in a man. Talent without it is a glorious vessel without a stearsman— and tact without talent is a canoe with a good one— such sculling and sculking to save a miserable Vol. II. 14 cargo not worth saving!—combine the two, and you have a glorious bark, and a gallant armament ready to go forth upon the waters at all seasons,—blow high or blow low. With them you may not discover worlds like Columbus, because there are none to discover, but you may conquer and control them— and, above all worlds, the world of the heart.” Indulging such reflections, Bradshaw advanced until he trod on a natural meadow, begirt with the woods. A rich long grass covered the field, with here and there a clump of wild wood, or a solitary oak standing in its pride alone, or a knot of wild flowers, all redolent with the richness of summer. Beneath a majestic oak, that was full of bullets, stood the monument of which he spoke, erected to the memory of the gallant Colonel Glover, who fell there in our late war with Great Britain; in an engagement in which he led the bravest corps on the field. He was buried where he fell, by his soldiers, who, disheartened, retreated after they had performed the hasty rite. They rallied, however; and, after a hard conflict, forced their foes to take to their boats. Bradshaw stood beside the monument, and with a quickening pulse, read as follows: “To the Memory of THE GALLANT COLONEL WILLIAM GLOVER, who fell on this spot IN DEFENCE OF THE LIBERTIES OF HIS COUNTRY, this Memorial was erected BY HIS COMPANIONS IN ARMS.” “Glory to the battle-field, and to the sleeper!” exclaimed Bradshaw, with enthusiasm. “What, though there is blood upon thy laurel, Glover! it is the blood of those who came to enslave the free. There let it be; a jewel in the cap of liberty, that crowns thy monument. How beautiful the sky above! how beautiful the earth beneath! how tranquil all around! yet here the foot of battle trod with thundering sound. On this spot was the thick of the fight, and 'twas on such a day as this. Through the woods there—through that opening that leads to the river, came the marshalled host. And over this field to meet them, came Glover and his little band. How I should like to be a captain in such a cause, with brave men round me— It would be better than making speeches to their memory—it would be earning the tribute.” Bradshaw threw himself at the foot of the monument, and leaning his head upon his hand, gave himself up to ambitious reveries. In a few minutes he heard the sound of music, and, looking through the opening in the woods, saw the party whom he had left, coming in the direction of the monument, doubtless with the intention of visiting it, preceded by the band of music. He lay delighted with the martial sound for a moment, and then with a sense of the ridiculous, which the present scene inspired, in contrast with the one on which he had been musing, he arose, smiling to himself, and commenced cutting a bullet from the tree. They soon reached the spot where he stood, Miss Penelope leaning on Selman's arm, while he held Bradshaw's hat in his hand. “Why, Mr. Bradshaw, is that you!” exclaimed Miss Penelope: “you're a pretty runaway, sir.” “These bullets are difficult to extract, Miss Penelope—Selman, your knife is qualified now to be put in the painting of the end of all things. Miss Penelope, how much this oak is like a gentleman's breast! Some of these bullets, when they struck, were nearly spent, and just lodged within the bark, skin-deep; others have gone deeper, and some have doubtless pierced the heart. Yet it is a remarkable fact, that, notwithstanding these heart wounds, the tree, as you see, is green and flourishing.” Selman looked at Bradshaw, and shook his head imploringly. “Miss Penelope,” Bradshaw continued, “how forcibly this scene reminds one of Byron's lament for young Howard, in Childe Harold,— “`—When showered The death-bolts deadliest, the thinned files along, Even where the thickest of war's tempests lowered, They reached no nobler breast than thine, young gallant Howard.' Selman, what's the next verse? Don't you recollect it?” Affecting to put on a look of memory, while chagrin prevailed, Selman said— “No, I don't remember it.” “Ah! I have it,” said Bradshaw, and he recited with feeling— “`There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee, And mine were nothing, had I such to give; But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree, Which, living, waves where thou did'st cease to live, And saw around me the wide field revive, With fruits and fertile promise, and the spring Came forth her work of gladness to contrive, With all her reckless birds upon the wing, I turned from all she brought, to those she could not bring.”' “Oh! Mr. Bradshaw, how beautiful and how appropriate!” exclaimed Miss Penelope. “And, Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, “you were speaking of Mrs. Glover to-day, you remember, and her mournful beauty; farther on, Byron expresses the sentiment you uttered— “`—Though the sound of fame May for a moment sooth, it cannot slake The fever of vain longing, and the name So honoured, but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.”' “Bradshaw!” exclaimed Selman, petulantly, “you had better mount the monument, and give us the whole poem.” “If I were to begin,” said Bradshaw, “I should certainly go on as long as Miss Penelope approved; but, Selman, too much of a good thing, you know, even of love, [this was said in a whisper, which only Selman heard,] is good for nothing.” About night-fall, the party returned to the city. “Bradshaw,” said Kentuck, “it's a beautiful night. The ladies propose going out to Mr. Carlton's: it will be a delightful ride in the moonlight. Come, let's to S—y, and take a luxuriant bath, and then for a merry ride.” “I'm for a bath,” said Bradshaw, “but not for the country.” When they parted, Bradshaw repaired to Jane Durham's. “Well, Jane, my old school-mate and fair ally, how did you spend the fourth?” 14* “With the undistinguished throng,” said she; “I repaired to the church this morning, sir, and heard the oration.” “Ah! I felt your presence. Let me see—yes, you sat to the extreme left, and kept your veil over your face. I thought I caught an eye I knew through it—you sat then just before Miss Carlton.” “Yes, but you did not look at me, Mr. Bradshaw; you looked beyond me, as the mariner looks beyond the poor wreck, upon the waters, to his home. Well, my life, ignoble as it has been, has not been useless; I can say I have been the cause, in some measure, of the development of genius. I see the account of your speech, which Mr. Jekyl published, is going the rounds of the papers—it gives me notoriety. Mr. Jekyl's wife will be jealous of the praises which he lavishes upon my good looks. I saw the ladies look at me to-day as if they did not know what to make of me. Oh, your sister has a sweet face!—and what a beautiful blue eye Miss Carlton has—she is lovely, indeed. I should say she was proud, but frank and independent.” “I don't know that she is proud—she certainly is frank and independent.” “I like her step—there is something bewitching in her, independent of her beauty. I have been melancholy to-day; I know not why—sad—sad. I have escaped a most horrible fate; and I ought to feel thankful and grateful—and I do; but why, why will mournful thoughts intrude? No, no! no one can err and be happy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. One bright summer's day, Bradshaw called on Miss Carlton, at Mrs. Holliday's, and found her alone, looking over the prints in a costly and beautiful album, which her father had given her. “Clinton,” she exclaimed, as he entered the room, “you have just come in time. Now you shall not refuse. I had just rung the bell to send John to your office with a peremptory note, sir, requiring—a lady has a right to require—that you would write in my album; it is a high honour, sir. I wish you to write in it the first. Come, though I've heard you say that you never would write in an album—they were such namby pamby things— yet this is not a namby pamby one; and I did not buy it for the vanity of receiving compliments in it; it was given me by my father.” “It is a beautiful one,” said Bradshaw, taking a seat by her side, and looking over it; “these pictures are in fine taste. See that one, Mary; how devotedly that lover holds his lady's hand. Have there not been moments in your life when you wished you could be like that picture, for ever to remain as you were, when now should be for ever.” “There may come such moments,” said Miss Carlton, slightly blushing, and laughing, as she threw back her curls, “but remember, now I'm fancy free.” “Ah! those are beautiful lines of Moore's, written in a lady's album, in which he hoped that in her heart he could find an unwritten place, as in her book. He says: “`Oh, it would be my sweetest care To write my name for ever there.”' Your heart, then, is unwritten upon, Mary—and who may write there?” “It must be done with sympathetic ink, sir,” said she, archly; “the name on my heart can only be read by the light of the flame from another's.” “Good! good!—report says that Mr. Bates, and Turnbull, and Talbot, have all been at your shrine. Have neither of those gentlemen kindled flame enough to make the ink visible?” “Oh! I don't know; they hav'n't tried yet.” “Talbot has been trying, I'm told, for some time.” “He has not tried hard enough, then—there must be more fuel on the flame.” “He goes with you to the Springs, does he not?” “No, he does not go with us to the Springs. He goes, I believe, as others go.” “And Mary, I suppose, this is to be the first of your going formally into company, as the fashionable phrase it?” “I don't care about going to the springs. I would rather stay at home; but father wishes it.” “Well! Talbot will have many opportunities. You had better say yes to him, Mary, at once.” “Yes to him, at once!” exclaimed Miss Carlton, angrily. “Clinton, don't you persuade me too much; recollect, you have an eloquence that is irresistible, folks say.” “Ah! Mary, if I had, I would not plead Talbot's cause for the wealth of the Indies, I would—” Here the servant entered, and announced visiters. Bradshaw sat a few moments after their announcement, and then withdrew, taking with him the album. He went to his office, and after walking up and down the floor, five or ten minutes, he wrote in it the following LINES. Mary, the gay and glittering world, With many a dream to gladness given, With many a fairy hope unfurl'd, Like gorgeous clouds in summer ev'n. With many a pleasure, whose bright hue Is woven from a poet's dreams; With many a joy, that seems all true, In whate'er fond shape it seems. Like a bright bird in beauty glancing, O'er a smooth, yet unknown sea; Thus, Mary, thus, thy steps advancing; Thus, the gay world is wooing thee. And thou: O! never yet the gay Have wooed a fairer to their throng; Though from them has the poet's lay, Chosen the very soul of song. Thou, with a step as light as Love's, E'er a rude breath has touch'd his wing; When on he sports through moonlit groves, To taste the balmy breath of spring— When all around to joy is given, And the fair stars, love-list'ners, true, Have met, as if to hear of heav'n, In some fond lover's interview: Thou, thus art entering 'mid the gay; And Mary, like that love boy, thou Wilt make o'er wounded hearts thy way, E'en with his own laughing brow. How often in the mazy dance, How often, wilt thou, Mary, move; Unconscious that each passing glance, Awakes so many dreams of love. How often in the moonlit eve, With some one happy by thy side; The fairy web of hope thou'lt weave, Forgetting all the world beside. Alas! dull care so much deforms! These sunny moments come between, Like sun-shine in the time of storms, Gilding a darkly coloured scene. Mary, there is a cloud for all— A speck in summer's brightest day; In autumn, how the sear'd flow'rs fall! In winter, where, alas! are they? Enough! I must not speak of sorrow, Beautiful, gay girl to thee; If it must come, it shall not borrow Anticipation's frown from me. Mary, I may not tell thee more, Like a gay bark, thy step is free; I stand upon the lonely shore, A left one, looking after thee. Bradshaw had scarcely written the lines, when he saw, passing by his window, Mrs. Holliday's servant: he called him in, and after wrapping the album up, carefully, desired him to give it to Miss Carlton. The next Sabbath was a beautiful day. Bradshaw, who had been up late the previous evening at his studies, did not arise until the first church bells disturbed his reveries; when, looking out upon the beauty of the morning, he determined to visit the Purchase. He mounted his horse, and, turning from the turnpike, entered an old county road, now scarcely ever used, that wound round by Mr. Carlton's, leading, by the foot of his garden, to the Purchase. The sounds of the church-bells grew fainter and fainter, as, with a free rein, he dashed along. The road was unpaved, narrow, and winding. He often had to bow his head, to avoid the branches of the trees, which hung over it, from either side. The bright day infused its gladness into his spirit, and merrily, merrily, he went. As he passed by Mr. Carlton's garden, he saw Mary Carlton standing by the door of the summer-house, and he called out to her— “What! Mary,—not at church?” “No; they're all gone. They called round for me: I was to go—but, being, like the rest of my sex, capricious, I all at once determined to remain. They return here, and dine. Are you going to church?” “Not unless you go. Are you all alone?” “There is nobody but the servants about the house, and the house-keeper. You had better go to church.” “I think not, Mary. I will put my horse up, and be by your side in a moment, fair lady; and if you convince me I ought to go to church, by the same argument I'll convince you, and we'll go together.” Bradshaw rode to the house, gave his horse to a servant, and entered the garden. “There, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, is one of the prettiest roses you ever saw. Let me put it in the button-hole of your vest: no! in your coat—it will look prettier. Why have you such a Byronian propensity for wearing black? I declare, if Sully were to paint your portrait, and it was ever so good a likeness, I should not know it, unless he put you in sables.” “Why, Mary, you have on black, too.” “But I don't always wear black.” “No!—you look well in any thing. That's a beautiful silk, and then it fits you so well; and that pearl buckle. Why, you're a lady of taste.” “You've too many pretty speeches lately, Clinton. Come, I want you to find fault with me.” “Find fault with you! I can do that easily.” “How?” “By indulging my imagination.” “There it is again! Clinton, you are an abominable flatterer; and you've no conscience about it—you flatter all alike, and, I expect, commit your pretty things to memory, beforehand.” “Yes, I always have them by heart.” “So Miss Penelope Perry says. Upon my word, sir, you paid a great compliment to the rest of the ladies, on the fourth of July, to leave them all, and wander away in the woods, for heaven knows how long, with Miss Penelope. Mr. Selman is convinced, no doubt, that you take a deep interest in his suit.” “Yes, he is thoroughly convinced of it, I hope.” “No doubt; and of what is Miss Penelope convinced? Has your eloquence persuaded her to accept Mr. Selman?” “I hope Mr. Selman's eloquence has had that effect, without my aid.” “You were the junior counsel, I suppose, then, Squire Bradshaw, and opened the case—just made a statement of it. Miss Penelope came out to the Purchase last night, and has gone to church with Mr. Selman. She said she expected you out; and, from her manner, one might think she wished you to continue the pleading—or, perhaps, you intend to file a declaration in another case.” “I shall have no opportunity. Miss Penelope goes with you to the Springs, does she not?” “Yes, sir.” “Does she go with you to Washington?” “No—I believe she returns. Did she not tell you?” “No. Mary, you will be away a long time, if you go from the Springs to Washington, and stay there until congress adjourns.” They had, during this conversation, entered the summer-house and seated themselves by a table, on which were books, fancy baskets, and a number of other articles; among them, Miss Carlton's album. Bradshaw turned over the leaves of the album while he spoke, and, in doing so, he discovered Vol. II. 15 that the lines he had written in it were cut out. “Mary,” he asked—“what has become of my scribbling?” “I cut it out,” said she, blushing. “Ah, Mary—then you thought them unworthy of your book?” “No, sir.” “Then you did not like the sentiments?” asked he, his brow slightly flushing. “Perhaps, Mr. Clinton, I may like the sentiments so much, as to have cut them out to keep them all to myself,—liking them above even the vanity of showing them. But here, sir,” said she, rising from his side, and plucking a flower, “here's a sprig of heart's ease for you,—I must run to the house to give some directions about dinner, that I had forgotten,—and, Mr. Clinton, by the time I return, do you write me some verses on it. I take so much care of your verses, that you can't refuse.” And she, laughing, left him. Bradshaw gazed fondly after her; and, as she entered the house, he wrote on the blank sheet of a novel, the following IMPROMPTU. How easy 'tis to give the flower, That emblem's careless ease of heart; Yet give the very gift the power To bid that careless ease depart. For if forth from its budding leaves, Young, nestling Hope should breathe her sigh, Too soon the trusting lover grieves To find the flower, and hope must die. Then, Mary, ere again we part, Oh give me back the priceless dower— The careless, happy ease of heart, That cheered me ere you gave the flower. “Here!” exclaimed Miss Carlton, as she returned, and entered the summer-house—“here's the squirrel you gave me: I've made him quite tame; but I still have to keep a chain round him. Let me see what you have written. Ah!—what a Byronian hand you write. Give you back your heart. I doubt, Mr. Clinton, if you ever had a heart. A wretched hand—a wretched hand, you write, sir. You'll have to make your declaration by word of mouth to Miss Penelope. If you write it, the only passion you'll awaken, will be downright anger at your abominable scrawl. Look yonder!—there they come from church. How well your sister rides. Mr. Willoughby is by her side: he's one of the handsomest men I ever saw. And there's Miss Penelope and Mr. Selman: just observe how Mr. Selman amuses himself with switching the leaves off of the trees. Come,” said she, putting the novel, in which the verses were written, into a fancy basket which she held in her hand, and throwing her handkerchief over it—“we must not be found here têteà-tête: Miss Penelope will grow jealous. Come, bring my squirrel.” “No, Mary, let us remain here a moment. How beautifully they wind along!—Kentuck's a glorious horseman.” “Yes, sir. And what do you think of Miss Penelope?—This afternoon you may have an opportunity of filing your declaration.” “Stay, Mary, and let me file it now,” said Bradshaw, seizing her hand, and speaking in a trembling tone. “No! no!—Come, Clinton, let's go to the house,” exclaimed Miss Carlton, trying to laugh away a blush. Bradshaw held her hand a prisoner, while he said— “Mary, you are on the eve of leaving for the Springs, and then for Washington. You will be absent a long time. I may not have another opportunity of speaking to you before you depart. Hear me, Mary,”—and he gently drew her to a seat. She bowed her head till her rich curls covered her cheek, as Bradshaw continued, in a voice that had passion and eloquence in its every tone— “Where you go, you will have many lovers, Mary. I know it—I feel it: the proudest, the wealthiest, the greatest of the land. They will gather around you in the beautiful and brilliant scenes, where you will be loveliest. And I—I— will you sometimes remember me then?—I will look after you, and listen to hear of you, with more passionate fondness than I can tell. Will you sometimes think of me, then, Mary?” “I will,” murmured Mary. “Mary, I have sometimes hoped that you had a regard for me; but, then, it seemed to me but as a sister's. Shall it be more, Mary—say, shall it be more?” Mary whispered that it should. “Bless you, bless you, my beautiful, my own Mary, for what you have said. Mary, you have not been much in the world yet. In it, courted, admired, loved, worshipped, idolized, as you will be, this preference will be tried in a way that you dream not of. I would not steal your heart. I ask no pledge from you, which another may make you repent you have given. But if, when you return from the world—then, when I am more in it than I am now, for, by the spirit of the Pilgrims, I will be—then, if I may thus hold your hand, and learn from you that your feelings are unchanged, I shall be happier—no, no: there is a passion beyond words. Mary, I have not had one dream of ambition in which you were not the guardian angel. I have not built one fairy castle in which you were not the loved one. My household gods can never make me happy, unless you are by my hearth. I struggle in the thick crowd to deserve you. 'Tis not so much that my name may sound in men's ears that I press on, but that you may pronounce it, and deem it not unworthy to be yours.” Bradshaw caught her in his arms, passionately, as he spoke. At this moment, the garden gate was heard to open, and Miss Carlton sprang away from her lover, exclaiming, “O! my squirrel, my squirrel, he's gone.” And she hastened out of the summer-house after him, and Bradshaw followed. It was the party from church that entered the garden. “Excellent!” exclaimed Miss Penelope, laughing: “your sudden determination to stay at home was to catch runaway squirrels, was it?” 15* Miss Carlton was very much confused; but Bradshaw stepped before her, so as to hide her confusion. He had caught the squirrel, and he handed it to Miss Penelope, saying, “You see, Miss Penelope, it is easy to catch runaway squirrels, when you have a chain round their necks. No matter how far you go into the woods, there is no danger of their escaping—they become attached—they'll always play about the place where you are—at any moment you may seize the chain, and draw them to you.” “Very well, Miss Mary Carlton,” said Miss Penelope, turning away from Bradshaw, with a consciousness of what he meant: “so I suppose your sudden determination kept Mr. Bradshaw from going to church.” Mary Carlton, who had recovered from her confusion, said, archly, “Do you think, Miss Penelope, that I will let you run away with all the beaux? No, indeed. Mr. Bradshaw was quite pious this morning—as anxious as Robinson Crusoe to see and hear the church-going belle. He wanted another tête-à-tête, like that of the battle-ground, but gallantry forbade him to leave me; and I peremptorily refused to go to church with him—for I have no intentions of furthering your designs on two or three gentlemen at once.” Selman, who was by the side of Miss Penelope, complacently switching his boots with his riding-whip, started and looked blank, when the latter part of the sentence fell upon his ear, while Miss Penelope exclaimed, “And so, Mr. Bradshaw, you would not come to church, you're out of my books entirely, sir: I've done with you.” “Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, “you must not pronounce judgment before you hear the cause.— I'll have to get Selman to plead it for me.” “Yes,” said Miss Penelope, “you should; Mr. Selman is so admirable a pleader, no doubt, in his own causes.” “Dirn it,” whispered Selman to Bradshaw, “don't begin your foolery, and knock every thing into a cocked hat.” While Mary Carlton said, “Penelope, we know you're a kind of female Napoleon, in the world of the heart—that you go on conquering and to conquer; but I'll rally all the girls as my allies, and then look out for a Waterloo defeat.” “Even then,” said Selman, “Miss Penelope will have the consolation of knowing that she has had the crown.” “Oh! certainly, Mr. Selman; and, that your devotion was to herself, and for herself—that it had nothing to do with the jewels and the diadem.” In the progress of the afternoon, Bradshaw left the company, and sauntered out alone in a noble grove, near the house. Selman, who surmised there had been some tender passage in the summer-house, between Bradshaw and Mary Carlton; and who took, of course, a sympathetic interest in such matters, joined him in his walk. Bradshaw suspected his intentions, and was not long kept in doubt; for Selman looked round cautiously, and then, in a quick, but subdued, voice, he asked, “Bradshaw, hey! how did you come on in the summer-house?” “What, on that subject, Selman?” “Yes! Your own subject, I mean. I thought, probably, there might be something between Miss Mary and you. She took me up pretty short about jewels. I don't like such allusions.” “This is a devil of a world, Selman,” said Bradshaw, with a most melancholy voice. “Hey! What! Thunder! Has she rejected you?” “The thing's pretty much fixed, I suspect.” “Well! I never was more astonished in my life— never. I would not have believed it if you had not told me. I always was satisfied she liked you. Why, dirn it, she don't pretend to hide it—she evidently prefers your company to all others.” “Yes—that may be, Selman; but, you know, she lived at the Purchase, and it may be only a sisterly regard. When there's love in the business, a lady is very apt to be shy, and, at least, affect to like the society of others—particularly, when her lover is by.” “I don't know but what that's a fact—for you say Miss Penelope likes me, and every body sees she treats me just so.” “It's hard to form a correct opinion of women, Selman.” “Hard! I consider it a matter of moral impossibility. The more I think of it, the more I'm perplexed. Just when you think you've fixed them,” continued Selman, shaking his head with the gravity of Lord Burleigh, in the Critic, “by Jove, they fix you. But, Bradshaw, I'd no idea of it. Miss Penelope has said to me, in confidence, that she was satisfied Miss Carlton was attached to you— her very words. She has refused Talbot, who's a confounded good-looking fellow, and talented—refused him, pint blank; and, as for Bates, she laughs at him. Bradshaw, you stood it well; your manner did not betray it. She was confused when we came up. It's just the reverse with me. I always look like a fool, or, at least, feel like one; and Miss Penelope laughs. Why, you seemed in as good spirits as usual, all day.” “How do you and Miss Penelope come on?” “O! I hav'n't spoken to her on that subject since that dirn night of the dinner. I want her to forget it. She treats me very well, though. Don't you think so?” “Yes, very.” “The fact is, Bradshaw, I think Bates is a gone chicken:—that whaling I gave him, did for him, at any rate. Well! well! I thought you could get any of the women: I did, upon my honour. I begin to believe that Talbot, since Miss Carlton has refused him, is making up to Miss Penelope—don't you think so?” “I saw him escort her to church, last Sunday. Did she take his arm?” “Take his arm!—no!—did she?” exclaimed Selman, in great alarm. “She never would take mine. I kept at a distance behind them, from church—but I watched them. She didn't take his arm—I'll swear to it—going home. Did you ever see her?” “Never. I've seen her take Kentuck's.” “Yes, I know it; and I don't know what to make of Willoughby, either. I hav'n't the faith in him I used to have.” “Why not?” “Why not! Why, I suspect him of having a sly hankering after Miss Penelope; and I don't think its very friendly on his part. He's a confounded fine-looking fellow, and he has a taking way with the women. Have you heard him speak of returning to Kentucky, lately?” “No, I have not.' “Nor I—not one word now-a-days. Bradshaw, I wish you would find out what his feelings are with regard to Miss Penelope.” “I will. But, to tell you the truth, I don't think you have any thing to apprehend from him. He's your friend: he knows of your attachment; and, I am satisfied, he entertains no thought that way. You must not say a word on this subject of mine, to any one, Selman.” “Not I!—not a word!—what are you going to do, Bradshaw?” “Leave matters just as they are, and go-ahead at the law!” “Well, I would have sworn that she liked you, and I believe it now just as firmly as if she had told you so!” During the latter part of this conversation, they had left the grove, and were walking towards the house. Bradshaw parted from Selman to visit the stables. The latter, in profound and perplexed rumination, on “the subject” of their conversation, entered the porch, and met Miss Carlton leaving it. “Which way, Miss Mary, all alone?” “For my fancy basket, sir, that I left in the summer-house.” “Let me save you the trouble.” “Thank you, sir, I doubt if you could find the one I want, there are several baskets—but come on.” “Miss Mary how did you enjoy yourself on the fourth?” “Oh! very well, sir. How did you enjoy yourself, Mr. Selman? I thought you seemed quite in a philosophic mood for such an exciting and patriotic occasion.” “I—Oh! Miss Mary, I enjoyed myself very much towards the latter part of the day; in the morning, I had a bad headach. I was prevented hearing the oration. How did you like it?” “Very much—I like every thing Clinton says.” “Ah! every thing.” “Yes, sir—every thing I hear him say. Why do you echo me?” “Oh nothing—I rejoice to know you're so universally pleased with him—I wonder he don't get married.” “It may be, Mr. Selman, that Mr. Bradshaw, like other gentlemen that you and I know of, don't find the ladies so very consenting as your vanity has led you to believe.” Selman gave his coat collar a twitch, as if it did not set to please him. By Jove, thought he, Bradshaw's in a bad fix. He was in the act of concocting a remark, when Miss Penelope, who had observed them from the window of the house, moved by impulses which our readers may easily imagine, entered the garden. Towards night Emily Bradshaw returned to the Purchase, her brother and Willoughby escorted her there, and then proceeded to town. Selman and Miss Penelope remained with Mary Carlton. After the ladies had retired to their chamber, while Mary stood before the glass, arranging her hair for her pillow, Miss Penelope, who sat at the open window looking out upon the garden, and thrumming with her pretty fingers against her lips, broke a silence of some moments, by saying— “The truth is, Mary, we must yield to these creatures, the men, after all.” Mary Carlton paused, in the act of confining a stray curl under her cap, and, with an arch expression, said— “I know it—I suppose, Miss Penelope Perry, you have no insuperable objections to yielding, have you?” “Why, not insuperable, exactly; but one hates to give up ones liberty, and the pleasure of tormenting—It won't do to torment a husband; as soon as you begin it with him, my gentleman will pick up his hat with such a provoking quietness, and wend his way to his office or counting-room, to the theatre, or on a fishing or gunning party, with the indifference of a grand Mogul. I declare to you, Mary, I hate the thought of it. I wonder now if Henry Selman could bring me to consent to have him, if he ever would take on such airs afterwards.” “Its more than probable he would, unless you abate the airs you put on now.” “I wish I was a queen—Queen Elizabeth, as Scott describes her, with Raleigh, Essex, Leicester, all at her feet; wouldn't you like it?” “Yes, for the pleasure of giving a princely hand to such a princely fellow as Essex.” “I don't believe I'd be merciful, as Mr. Bradshaw says, to any of them. But then the misfortune is, Mary, that we can't commence a flirtation, however much in jest, without getting the heart touched after awhile—this sentimentality is my abhorrence! What a love-sick swain Mr. Henry Selman would be, should he get involved in the tender passion.” “What a love-sick swain he is you mean! And the truth is, Penelope, you have not a proper regard for his feelings.” “Ho, ho, you're getting sentimental—quite a sign, Miss Mary. You don't pretend to deny, now, that there was some tender passages between you and Mr. Bradshaw, to-day, in the summer-house, do you?” “Penelope, you seem to think, because Mr. Selman has made a `tender of his affections to you,' that every body else has received similar tenders.” “You can't hide it from me, Mary. Mr. Bradshaw was cunning enough to hide your confusion, and try to confuse me; but I saw through it, and I shrewdly suspect, from his manner and yours, that his eloquence prevailed.” “Ah! indeed, what makes you think so?” asked Mary Carlton, affecting to put her question in an indifferent tone. “Oh, I've some experience Miss Mary, as well as you. When a lady tries to hide a gentleman's Vol. II. 16 confusion, on such an occasion, it shows—but, come, what do you think it shows?” “It shows,” said Miss Carlton, laughing, “that she has made a conquest, and is doubtful; rather disposed to yield—but she wants pressing, hey! Penelope; such, for instance, as you may form some idea of, if you remember what happened in the garden, after I left you and Mr. Selman there, to-day.” “Go on!” exclaimed Miss Penelope. “Well, when the lady is anxious to exhibit the gentleman's confusion, it proves that she is a coquette, who only cares for conquest—for glory; that she has no clemency, and would chain the conquered to the wheels of her triumphal car.” “Go on, Mary, and tell us what's the sign when the gentleman hides the lady's confusion.” “Oh, I know no more—here ends my catechism.” “Well, I'll instruct you; when a gentleman tries to hide a lady's confusion, on such a tender occasion, it shows that she has been wooed and won— witness the summer-house this morning, when you were catching runaway squirrels. You must keep a tight chain round the neck of your squirrel, Mary, I tell you. If you knew what was said to me on the fourth, you would think there was some probability of my cutting you out.” “Ah, well, you were determined I should not cut you out this afternoon. But, joking aside, what are you going to do with Mr. Selman?” “Do with him what you're determined to do with Mr. Bradshaw—have him, I suppose; and I declare to you I hate the thought—but as one must settle down into matrimony, sooner or later, the sooner the better.” “A fair conclusion, Miss Penelope Perry.” “Mary, Henry Selman is as blind as a beetle to a smitation. Sometimes I really pity him; do you think he didn't tell me, after you left us in the garden this afternoon, that he was afraid you had acted very coquettishly, and rejected Mr. Bradshaw.” “Nullified the union! Poor fellow—he thought Mr. Bradshaw's experience must tally with his own. He did not know, that though you sometimes pretend to hoist the single star, you are, nevertheless, like the rest of woman kind, for union to a man, as the epigram says.” “Mary, you should have heard my sister Priscilla, the evening of the fourth of July. Such a lecture she did inflict on me! Poor Prisy has had her day with the dashing beaux, and she begins to settle down into an idea of parsons and sober sedate gentlemen of a certain age. She has a sisterly regard for me, and, I expect, when about my years, she was a complete flirt; she flirted herself out of two or three lovers, and is now as repentant as any sinner you ever saw; she is so anxious to make amends for it, that I have no doubt she will accept the first staid, sober, discreet gentlemen who offers. Indeed, she scolded so loudly, and threatened such awful threats of telling mother— whom Mr. Bradshaw has talked into believing Henry Selman the best young man in the world— of my improper conduct and total disregard of Mr. Selman's feelings, as she called it, that I was forced to promise her, that the next time the poor creature talked to me of love, I would just stop his mouth at once, and for ever, on that subject, by accepting him. I suppose Mr. Bradshaw has persuaded you to make him the happiest man in the world—is not that the way these lovers phrase it?— at such an early date, that it is too late for me, to ask you to be my bridemaid, and I must be yours.” Long before their conversation ended, their cheeks were upon their pillows. Selman, who rested in the adjoining room, reported to Bradshaw, that long after midnight, he heard the indistinct hum of their voices, and though (shameful that he should confess such a thing,) he tried his hardest to hear, he could not distinguish one word of their conversation. What was farther said, we may not relate, for we fear our fair readers have accused us already of betraying secrets which gentlemen are not entitled to hear. Not long after the above conversation, Miss Penelope and Selman were married. Mary and Emily were her bridemaids, and Bradshaw and Willoughby, his grooms'-men. In due time, Mary Carlton went to the Springs. She corresponded regularly with Emily Bradshaw, and gave her piquant accounts of the motley crowd, among whom she moved the most attractive belle. Frequent reports reached Bradshaw of her conquests. These reports not only told what gentlemen were wooing her, but of engagements made, &amp;c. &amp;c. Talbot was frequently mentioned as one of the best received of her admirers. All this Bradshaw heard with feelings which required a stubborn effort to command. Though he would not believe them, they gave him a heart-chill often, but he banished them from his reflections with a stern pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. As the time approached, when the candidates for state legislature were generally announced,—Jekyl, who, as our readers are aware, had become the editor of a weekly paper, called on Bradshaw, and said— “Mr. Bradshaw, they talk of bringing you out for the legislature.” “Ah! do they. What chance do you think I'd stand?” “I think you would be elected.” “I'm told that Talbot intends being a candidate. Is it a fact?” “I have heard such a rumour, but I don't know what credence to give it. Old Broadbelt and yourself, I have no doubt, will be elected. Have you been spoken to on the subject?” “Yes, several of my friends have mentioned it to me.” “There will be a meeting of the wards of the city where I live—of the mechanics—next Thursday evening, and you will be nominated.” “Jekyl, my friend,” said Bradshaw, “if I'm nominated, of course, I wish to be elected; there are several very popular men spoken of as candidates, and 16* as a number of important measures will be brought before our legislature this winter, there will be a deep interest felt in the election. I am obliged to you for your friendly feeling towards me; but you must give me time to think upon the business before the nomination is made.” “The workies are determined to nominate you, Bradshaw. It will be done. You can decline, you know, if you choose, after the nomination is made; but I really think you will be elected, and it will be of service to you in your profession.” Here, a client entered, and Jekyl took his leave, saying he would call again. When his client left, Bradshaw walked to Glassman's, with whom he had promised to sup, and go to the theatre, determined to consult him on the matter. “Why, Bradshaw,” said Glassman, “as Sir Roger would say, much may be said on both sides. You know, as I have told you, I've no turn for politics myself. The law is a jealous mistress, and requires, I might almost say, exclusive devotion from her votaries, if they would be successful: at least from most of them. Those who have high talents may wander, and yet advance in her good graces, even facilitating their progress by a knowledge of politics: for politics is the philosophy of law—but the number is small. You know there are many who can practise what they have only learned by rote, as the mountebank, by the aid of chemistry, can perform many tricks, though he knows nothing of the properties of the science. Thus practise too many lawyers. When a lawyer would be great, a knowledge of politics—I do not mean of party politics, but of the political history of his country—is necessary to his success in the high walks of his profession. But, nowdays, alas! politician and trickster, statesman and charlatan, are synonymous terms. Yet we—you are not compelled to tread the road, in becoming a politician, that others tread—if I have read you right, your nature will not let you. A man of your character and talents, (I speak to you as a friend; I use no flattery,) cannot avoid becoming a politician You have every requisite for making a statesman; ambition can be loftier than that of a successful a patriotic one—and, as you will sooner or later enter the arena, be your resolutions now what they may, I do not know but what you had better commence now: you can thus test the soundness of your partiality for political life, and if you think yourself unfitted for it, which, if you do justice to yourself, I believe you will not, you can quit it at once and much easier than if you were to commence politician after you had acquired an extensive legal reputation: then you would be more anxious to succeed even than you are now, because you would be aware, more would be expected from you, as ambition grows; yet, to tell the truth, your capability might be less, for the fact is, few lawyers who commence politicians late in life, do succeed. The law, as Burke says, is the `Chinese shoe on the mind,'—and, to make a pun, if you put the shoe on early, and wear it perpetually, you must expect to have a narrow understanding. To quote Burke again `when a new and a troubled scene is opened, and the file affords no precedent,' the man who has been all his life acting from precedent, and particularly from the technical precedents of the law, is in a situation that, whatever may be his natural capacity, is an embarrassed one, in which he is just as apt to go wrong as right. Bradshaw, I do not know of any animal in the natural history, who has so much unmitigated dulness about him, and upon him, as one of your mere lawyers. Meet one of them where you will, under any circumstances, at a bridal, or burial, at a play-house, or a prayer-meeting, and, if he can possibly find, or make an opportunity, he will poke some mooted tweedle dum tweedle dee point of law at you. His brain is like his parchment, engrossed with technicalities and quibbles: every thing else is foreign to the record.” “Yet, ours is a noble profession.” “Certainly, a noble profession to a noble mind,— a mind that connects literature and general science with it. But the fact is, Bradshaw, the mind must be a great one, indeed, that the study of the law does not `cabin, crib, confine.' In my intercourse with men, who stand the highest in their profession, I have been literally astonished with the extent of their ignorance, and the audacity with which they will proclaim it, like a states' witness recounting his rascalities.” “That was a pungent sarcasm of Burke on Erskine, when he said, in combating Erskine's notions of an impeachment, that a nisi prius' lawyer, giving an opinion upon the duration of an impeachment, was like a rabbit that breeds six times a year, pretending to know of the gestation of an elephant.” “But it does not come under the definition that some one gives of wit—`a good thing well applied.' It is a good thing mis-applied, in that instance, though, no doubt, it applies generally to nisi prius' lawyers. I think Erskine the model of a constitutional lawyer. Was it not Johnson who said, that he who would write the English language correctly, must devote his days and nights to Addison? I should say, that the advocate who would utter arguments that convince, and eloquence that warms and persuades, must devote his days and nights to Erskine. I know no forensic efforts, that, take them all in all, compare with his. Read his argument in Hatfield's case—what a profound exposition of the different species of insanity, of their characteristics, and the legal responsibilities of each. What a glorious constitutional argument is that, on the trial by jury, in the Dean of St. Asaph's case. His defence of Stockdale I have read over and over again—that is a fine passage where he describes the `striking spectacle daily exhibited' at Hastings' trial: and he well characterizes the efforts of Burke and Sheridan, as `anathemas of superhuman eloquence.' That is a fine passage, too, where he describes the nature of British dominion in the east; and what can be more eloquent than his description of the `savage, holding a bundle of sticks in his hand, as the notes of his unlettered eloquence.' His conclusion, where he says, that the benevolent author of our being will judge us, as the jury should judge the passages in the book of Logan, which were indicted as libellous,—`holding up the great volume of our lives, and regarding the general scope of them,' is not surpassed in appropriateness, and in the combination of reason, eloquence, and sound morality, in any forensic effort I know of, unless it is by himself, in the defence of Bingham. “Erskine, Mr. Bradshaw, in his intercourse with the bar and bench, was a model of what becomes a lawyer. In his very first effort, when unknown, and when judges are more apt to be courted than opposed by a young aspirant, Erskine acted not only fearlessly, but nobly. When Lord Mansfield, from the bench, told him, in no very gentle manner, that Lord Sandwich was not before the court, Erskine exclaimed, he would bring him before the court, and indignantly commented on his conduct. Remember, that Sandwich was high in place and in power, that Erskine was powerless—was making his first speech, and in a borrowed gown, for he was too poor to buy one—that he had every thing to lose, and nothing to gain. I am wrong, he had something to gain,—the approval of his conscience and his country—the best rewards of honourable exertion. This manly spirit guided and guarded him through life. Erskine had his errors—who has not? For my part, when I gaze upon the diamond I think of its brilliant qualities, and not of the dirt that may sometimes partially obscure them. But you know his speeches, Bradshaw, as well as I—better, for you are fresh in them. Our professional men should devote themselves more to literature, biography, poetry, and history.” “It seems to me,” said Bradshaw, “that our statesmen—and most of them are, or have been, lawyers—are not surpassed by any in the world.” “Certainly not,” said Glassman. “I was not speaking particularly of our very foremost men, though they, I think, do not enough cultivate literature:—law and politics (and, I fear, party, personal politics) engross their attention, at least, now-a-days—I was speaking of the profession, generally. In a country where there is so general a diffusion of knowledge, as in ours, 'tis not he who knows the most, that has the greatest influence, but he who can make himself best understood, and who pleases while he instructs. Who thinks of wading through the interminable speeches of our congressmen? Most of the speakers do not want information on the subject on which they speak; but they deliver it in a jumbled, discordant mass, often with as little attention to the construction of their arguments, as their sentences. And, as for beauty of language, historical citation, or literary adornment, except in the speeches of two or three of our leading men, I do not know where you can find it.” “Did you know the late William Pinckney?” “Ah! yes. You should have heard him speak of Erskine. When Pinckney was minister at the court of St. James, he became acquainted with him, and heard him repeatedly. He entertained the highest opinion of him. Pinckney was, perhaps, the most thoroughly ambitious man I ever knew. He laboured in his last cause harder than he did in his first; and in every cause, as if his professional reputation depended upon it. Pinckney's style was too verbose and declamatory, and his manner violent beyond all description. Before he went to England, I am told by those who often heard him, his manner of speaking was mild and persuasive, and his voice silvery: on his return, he adopted a directly opposite oratory, which did not suit him. He was an intense student. We have often met in attendance on the supreme court, and I have repeatedly occupied a room adjoining his; when, if I had been a prisoner to my own, I could have told when any case of great importance, that excited public attention, and in which a distinguished man was to oppose him, was before the court. He would often walk his room all night; and not unfrequently, as I lay in bed, did I hear the rehearsal of the argument, which, the next day, I listened to in court. His perseverance was tireless. He loved his profession, devotedly; and, I doubt much, if, in any other vocation, he could have won so high a reputation. His mind was of an order that could rather acquire than create. He could not have succeeded in a work of the imagination—he might as an historian, if he had improved his style. But with the law his mind was thoroughly imbued—he comprehended its broadest principles, while he made a microscopic observation of the merest technicalities. His mind was argumentative and subtle; his figures of speech, his flights of fancy, cost him more labour than his argument: he almost always wrote them out, and committed them to memory. His argument was perfect without his fancy-work; and his fancy-work was perfect without his argument. His fancy did not grow out of his subject, like the leaf from the summer bough: it was rather stuck on it, like a flower in a cap, for display; and a certain chillness reminded us that it was a hot-house plant—a forced cultivation. Yet, as a lawyer, I know not his superior; and no man could do better than to confide his case to Mr. Pinckney —because he never neglected it, through indolence, pleasure, or inattention; and, if he took it in hand, he attended to it, not more for emolument, than for success and fame. An anecdote is related of him, which strikingly shows his character. When at the court of St. James, he was dining in company with Burke, Sheridan, Fox, and a host of great names, when a discussion arose upon some line in Virgil, I believe. All of them expressed their opinions but Mr. Pinckney; and, as he had said nothing, pro or con, they appealed to him as umpire. He had to confess his ignorance of the Latin language; but when he left the company, he sent immediately for a teacher, and commenced the study of it. He became an accomplished Latin scholar. While abroad, I am told, he was a hard student of the law, and a regular attendant on the courts, so that, when he returned, and again became a practitioner, instead of his contemporaries finding him rusty, as they expected, he entered the lists with his armour bright, and armed at all points.” “I like that in his character,” exclaimed Bradshaw; “it shows character.” “Bradshaw,” said Glassman, musingly—“yes, you had better be a candidate for the legislature. I think you will be elected. The Superior Court will meet, you know, at —, the same time as the legislature. You ought to attend that court, and Vol. II. 17 your election will send you to — in a double capacity, as a legislator and a lawyer. But, come, let us to the theatre—Mrs. Drake, the western actress, makes her appearance to-night, for the first time, I believe, on our boards. Your friend, Willoughby, whom I like very much, who is just such a man as you described him to be, promises me great things in her performance.” The theatre was crowded. Mrs. Drake appeared in the “Soldier's Daughter;” and when the curtain fell, Glassman, after the silent musing of a moment, exclaimed, “I cannot remove the impression from my mind, that it is impossible for Mrs. Drake to play any other character than this—she plays so naturally, that, never having seen her before, it seems to me it is her own character; and yet, you tell me, in Bianca and in Julia, she is just as great. O! what a gift is genius! and how fascinating in a woman!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. It is not our purpose to designate, in these idle pages, either of the political parties that now distract, or, if you please, divide our country. We are just from the thick of the fight ourselves, and we turn, with pleasure, from the stern reality to fancy; happy, if experience has taught us to copy from the great book of the world a not incorrect page or two. When the anticipated meeting of which Jekyl spoke convened, Bradshaw was unanimously nominated for the state legislature. The moment the nomination was made, a committee was appointed to wait on him forthwith, and request his attendance at the meeting. The committee found Bradshaw at his office, and, in a few minutes, he stood among his friends. They received him with enthusiastic applause. From that evening to the day of election, he attended meetings almost every evening, in the different wards—made speeches and friends. Talbot had, also, been nominated by a number of his friends, but he still loitered at the Springs, and left those who nominated him to electioneer for him. What is every body's business is nobody's business. Old Broadbelt and two others were also candidates. The city was only entitled to two representatives. Bradshaw was elected: he led the polls fifteen hundred and five votes. Broadbelt stood next. Talbot was within three hundred votes of Broadbelt. He returned to the city only two weeks before the election. His reputation for talent was high, and his family influence very extensive. If he had used half the exertion of Bradshaw, he would have been elected instead of Broadbelt. In the winter, Bradshaw attended the legislature, of course; and there he was thrown a great deal with Glassman, who was in attendance on the Superior Court. Glassman and Bradshaw roomed together. With his usual energy and perseverance, Bradshaw devoted himself to his duties. He did not show off in much speaking, and in making sarcastic remarks upon country members. He guarded the interests of his constituents, and conciliated even those whom he was compelled to oppose. Such was his popularity and tact, that persons from every part of the state, having business at the seat of government, would request his kind offices. Glassman, with real friendliness, assisted him in various ways, and exerted himself to advance his popularity and influence. “Bradshaw,” said Glassman to him, one night, when they were seated together in their room, “you have made an impression here of the right sort. Most young men go to the legislature to speak; you came here to act, and you have acted well. `Much speaking,' said John Randolph, in his best days—a maxim which he afterwards forgot, or, at least disregarded—`much speaking, Mr. Speaker, will cheapen abilities much greater than mine.' You have done nothing to cheapen your abilities in that line; in fact, you have done nothing that gave a touch of their quality, except your speech on the canal bill. Every body, the generality of persons, I mean, expected you to make splendid declamations; you have done better, you have shown yourself a thorough man of business. This spirit of interminable speech-making is the curse of our legislative halls. It is not only in bad taste, but a man loses his object by it, if it be any thing more than to make a speech which nobody will read. Our members of congress appear to think that their election gives them “`Full and eternal privilege of tongue,'— that they may measure out their speeches, as a clothier measures out his cloth, and the poorer the quality, the more they can afford to inflict for their per diem.” In enacting laws that cannot interest our readers, the session of the legislature passed. Bradshaw and Broadbelt reached the city of their constituents at night; the former obtained a horse from his colleague, sent word to the Rev. Mr. Longshore to have his office opened in the morning, and rode out to the Purchase. He found his father and family well. Mary Carlton was still at Washington; and he spent the evening in looking over her letters to his sister, which gave an interesting account of the characters and scenes of the capital. Not unfrequently his name occurred 17* in the correspondence; and when it did, he would pause and puzzle over the writing, and try to divine, in the shape of the letters formed by her delicate hand, the feelings which possessed her bosom while she wrote. What slight and trivial things are of interest to a lover—no matter how manly or determined his character. Bradshaw inquired for Willoughby, and learned he had not been to the Purchase for three or four days. In the morning, bright and early, he departed for town. As Bradshaw left the house, he heard Pete's mother, calling at the top of her voice, for her runaway assistant, who had left the churn just as the butter was “coming;” and gone, she knew not whither. When Bradshaw reached the gate, he found the recreant functionary parading it open with officious display, and holding in his hand what had once been a hat. “Pete, don't you hear your mother?” “Yes, Massa Clinton, but I want to shut the gate after you.” “And you want toll, hey?” Pete grinned, and dropped his hat to catch the fip, as Massa Clinton put his hand in his pocket. Bradshaw was glad to find himself once more seated in his office. His reverend attendant had put every thing to rights. He installed himself in his great arm-chair, and looked around, musingly, upon his books and papers, as we gaze upon the faces of familiar friends after a long absence. While thus engaged, a thin, peculiar-looking old man entered his office; and, sans ceremonie, took a seat. After a premonitory cough, and a rapid glance around the room, the stranger asked, “Are you Mr. Bradshaw, sir, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw?” “I am, sir.” “Fine day, sir; we shall have summer on us quick—ugh, ugh, ugh, (coughing,) you're just from the legislature, I'm told?” “Yes, sir; I returned last night.” At this moment Willoughby entered the office. He was dressed in a full suit of black, with a broad band of crape round his hat; his fine countenance was unusually pale and troubled. “Bradshaw, my friend, how are you?” said Willoughby, “you're welcome back.” “Kentuck, my heart of hearts—all hail to you!” exclaimed Bradshaw, jumping up and seizing him by the hand, “what's the matter!—is your uncle dead?” “Yes, he's gone to his long account.” “When did you hear it? I congratulate you upon your immense possessions.” “The day before yesterday. Bradshaw, my immense possessions are like the Irishman's flea—put your finger on him, and he's not there. I am not worth the boots I stand in—my uncle has not left me one cent.” “Not left you one cent! Is it possible! damn him! Why did you put on black for him?” “The old gentleman always treated me well: his wealth was his own, I suppose. It's a hard cut, Bradshaw. I expected to inherit the largest fortune in the west, and here you see me, penniless, and in debt. My uncle has been deceived, by cringing scoundrels round him. No matter—no matter: I wear this black for the good points in his character; he was peculiar—he had bad health —he—no matter, let his errors sleep with him—he was my father's brother.” “Take a seat, my friend,” said Bradshaw. “Are you sure there's no mistake in this?” “None; the letter's from my uncle's intimate friend. The old gentleman, like Swift, has founded a hospital for lunatics. A cool million gone to support those who have lost their wits, while I must live by mine; think of that, master Brook.” Here the stranger, who had arisen during the conversation, and advanced to the door, passed out. Bradshaw was so much interested in his friend, that he did not notice him. “Kentuck,” said Bradshaw, grasping his hand, convulsively, “my noble friend, you have that in you which will surmount sterner obstacles than the loss of fortune—you have glorious talents: God's best gifts—your uncle could not dispossess you of them. Be admitted to the practice of the law, when the court sits, and let us open shop together— hang out our shingle on the outer wall. You and I, Kentuck, against the field.” The Kentuckian released his hand from Bradshaw's grasp, to dash a tear from his eye. “This is unmanly,” he exclaimed, “but, Bradshaw, I will speak to you plainly: I am a beggar—I meant to return to Kentuck, and force my way,—but—but there's a strong spell binds me here—your sister!— I am attached to her—I have not told her of my attachment—I don't know that she suspects it.— I will accept your offer. We will hoist our shingle together—I will struggle hard; and when I can support her as she should be supported, I will tell her of my attachment, and win her, if I can, if your family has no objection.” “Kentuck, I am the only worldly one of my family. Rich or poor, I would rather call you brother, than any man in this big city. It is a hope I have nursed long: I suspected your feelings. Come,” continued Bradshaw, smiling, “mount your horse and ride out to the Purchase; see Emily— speak to her on `that subject,' as Selman would say,—now is the time to find out whether she loves you, for yourself, Kentuck.” “No, Bradshaw—no, not now—not now.” “Yes, now, Kentuck, now!” Here a number of Bradshaw's political friends, who had heard of his return, entered his office. While he was welcoming them, Willoughby left the room. In a moment afterwards, Bradshaw hurried after him; but he could not discover in what direction he had gone, and he was compelled to return to his company. In the meantime, Willoughby, internally resolving not to go to the Purchase, almost mechanically proceeded to the livery stable, and mounted his horse. He rode in a direction from the Purchase, for some time, brooding on his altered fortunes. He took from his pocket the letter informing him of his uncle's death, and the disposition of his property, and read it again—there was, alas! no mistake in it—he knew the hand-writing well. “I could bear it without a murmur,” said Kentuck, to himself, “were it not for my love of Emily Bradshaw. But why should I be such a fool?—I have never told her of my attachment. What is my loss of wealth to her?—why should it prevent me from going to the Purchase!—there I have always been treated with the greatest hospitality, and there I ought to go—but merely as a visiter.” While Willoughby pursued these reflections, his horse, that had been suffered to proceed without guidance, turned his head towards the Purchase, his accustomed route; and the rider having convinced himself that he ought to go there, but merely as a visiter, now put spurs to his steed, as if anxious to arrive before he altered his determination. He had not ridden far, before he checked the career of his horse, while he resolved some doubts on the propriety of his resolution; and in the midst of these conflicting feelings, he reached Mr. Bradshaw's gate. His horse stopped, while the rider, without attempting to open the gate, sat deliberating upon what he should do. He was just on the eve of determining to return to the city, when he reflected that it was his duty to visit the sister of his friend, and those who had always treated him with so much hospitality; and, looking through the fence, for he had, until this moment, been inattentive to objects around him, he beheld Mr. Bradshaw in the act of descending from his chaise, in which sat Mrs. Bradshaw, to open the gate. “Stay, Mr. Bradshaw,” exclaimed Willoughby, “and let me open it for you.” “Mr. Willoughby!—good morning, sir—if you please. You are quite a stranger.” “I have had some business that has kept me in town,” said Willoughby. “Is Miss Emily at the Purchase?” “Yes,” said Mrs. Bradshaw: “ride up to the house; you will find her there. We're going to neighbour Bryant's, who is sick.” Willoughby found Emily alone. With a quicker eye than her parents, she observed his mourning-suit, the broad band round his hat, and asked him, if he had lost a friend. “My only relative on earth, Miss Emily; my uncle.” She inquired when he died, and then, to relieve Willoughby's feelings, turned the conversation. “Mr. Willoughby,” she said, “I am obliged to you for the song you sent me the other day. I have been practising it, and—shall I sing it for you?” “If you please, Miss Emily. I like it, I suppose, because it was set to music by a professor whom I became acquainted with in Louisville, and who is now living in Cincinnati; he possesses fine musical taste and talent.” Emily Bradshaw ran her hand over the keys, thoughtfully, and then sang as follows.— “ABSENCE. “'Tis said that absence conquers love, But, O! believe it not; I've tried, alas! its power to prove, But thou art not forgot. Lady, though fate has bid us part, Yet still thou art as dear— As fixed in this devoted heart, As when I clasped thee here. “I plunge into the busy crowd, And smile to hear thy name— And yet, as if I thought aloud, They know me still the same: And when the wine-cup passes round, I toast some other fair; But when I ask my heart the sound, Thy name is echoed there. “And when some other name I learn, And try to whisper love, Still will my heart to thee return, Like the returning dove. In vain! I never can forget, And would not be forgot; For I must bear the same regret, Whate'er may be my lot. “E'en as the wounded bird will seek Its favourite bower to die, So, lady, I would hear thee speak, And yield my parting sigh. 'Tis said that absence conquers love; But, O! believe it not; I've tried, alas! its power to prove, But thou art not forgot.” After the song ceased, there was a silence for some moments, which Miss Bradshaw interrupted, by asking, “Then you return to Kentucky, Mr. Willoughby?” “No, Miss Emily. I don't know what I shall do.” So saying, Willoughby rose to depart. “Do stay to dinner, Mr. Willoughby. Brother will be out this afternoon, and he will be company in for you.” Emily Bradshaw observed that Willoughby was wrapped in a brooding, unquiet melancholy—and she exerted herself to dispel it. This gave a tenderness to her tone, always of the gentlest, that won upon his feelings, and unmanned his resolutions in spite of himself. He arose, advanced to the door as if to leave— and then returned to Emily's side, and told her all— of his uncle's will, of his poverty, and of his love. “I could have borne it for myself,” said he, “Emily—I beg pardon, Miss Bradshaw; but I had hoped—” “I know what you would say, Mr. Willoughby,” said Emily Bradshaw, looking up into his face, with a frankness worthy of her forefathers, with an eye, such as one of the most gifted of her sex, has ascribed to her race, on Plymouth rock, an eye— “Lit by her deep love's truth.” “I know what you would say, Mr. Willoughby. I should feel hurt with you, should you attribute to me the least mercenary feeling; there is my hand—you never asked it till to-day—you have had my heart long ago: I gave it to you when you were thought very rich, and I cannot take it away, and I would not,” continued she, smiling, “though you are very poor.”—In an altered tone, she added, “I care not what worldly advantage wealth might give to me. I have been taught to consider it a snare to the falling—but, indeed, I am sorry Vol. II. 18 for—sorry that your uncle did not better know your—your—worth.” She wept; Willoughby pressed her to his heart, and dried her tears upon his bosom. Willoughby sat by Emily Bradshaw, and told her of his intention of applying himself to his studies, and of the proposal which her brother had made to him of a partnership. He was certain, he said, that his profession would soon yield him a handsome income; and then talked over and over again with her, the plan of his future life. How susceptible a generous and brave nature is of the gentlest and tenderest emotions! The Kentuckian, as he thus conversed with Emily, thought of his loss of fortune with a glow of pride; for he felt that he was appreciated for himself, and he gazed on the fair girl by his side, and pressed her to his heart, with a passion amounting to enthusiasm. Emily Bradshaw cared very little for the loss, except as it affected her lover; and the manly manner in which he bore it, only endeared him to her the more. Mr. Bradshaw did not return home until late in the afternoon. Mrs. Bradshaw entered the house while her husband drove the chaise to the carriage-house; Willoughby followed after him—narrated to him all that our readers are aware of, and asked him if he had objections to his alliance. Mr. Bradshaw listened to Willoughby with an emotion which he in vain tried to suppress. He took him by the hand, and, after a silence of some moments, said— “You are not a religious man, Mr. Willoughby, but you have generous and noble impulses—and they govern you. I hope and believe that you will make the rule of action they dictate, a duty— a religious duty. Your uncle has done very wrong; he has brought you up to expect a very large fortune, and has cut you off, it seems, without any alleged misdemeanor on your part, merely through a whim, a caprice, or the improper influence of those around him in his dying hour. He did not know what effect it might have upon you. It would plunge many a young man into irreclaimable dissipation. I honour you for the manliness you have shown, and the resolutions you have made. I did not wish Clinton to study law, for I feared the vanities of the world would mislead him. He has done well so far; and I hope the Lord will forgive me if I have felt unbecoming pride in the world's report of him. I hope Clinton does not set too much store upon the honour of men. It is more uncertain, even than the gifts of fortune. I have enough of wealth—it satisfies all my wants; and why should it not satisfy my children. Emily (Mrs. Bradshaw,) and I are getting old; it would be hard for her and for me to part with our daughter—we should be all alone. If you follow your profession, you will have to live in town, and our daughter and our son would then both be away from us in the gay world. Why should you follow the law. I have often heard you say, you loved the simple pleasures of a country life; could not you be happy here? Mr. Willoughby you have my daughter's affection—pure and unsullied affection; and you have, wrapped up in her, a father's and a mother's deep, deep love. You will have, under God, the happiness of more than one committed to your charge. My son,” continued Mr. Bradshaw, in a tremulous voice, “think of what I have said—and may God, of his infinite mercy, bless you both.” Old Pete, who was taking the horse from the chaise, was an unobserved hearer of this conversation. He had more than once, with the pride of a family servant, boasted (negroes are quick in discovering such things) of the “rich and monstrous brave-looking beau his young missus had,” to the neighbouring negroes, and he felt a deep mortification—your old family servants feel as deeply as their masters, any thing that concerns the family—when he heard Willoughby tell Mr. Bradshaw of his disinheritance. As they left the carriage-house together, Mr. Bradshaw wrapped in his own thoughts, piously ejaculated, “The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord.” “Now, did ever any nigger hear the like of old Massa Bradshaw!” exclaimed old Pete, petulantly tossing the harness which he had just lifted from the back of the horse into the bottom of the chaise. “The Lord didn't take away Massa Willoughby's money at all, his mean uncle take it away, and I hope old Satten 'll roast him for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. We leave Willoughby with the lady of his love, and return to Bradshaw. After his political friends had left him, he sat alone in his office, musing on the disinheritance of Willoughby, when the peculiar-looking personage, with the cough, of whom we spoke in the last chapter, again entered. “Ugh, ugh!” coughed he, “much business doing in the legislature, Mr. Bradshaw?” “Yes, sir,” said Bradshaw, offering him a chair, “considerable.” “This is the first time you have been to the legislature,—ugh, ugh!—is it?” asked the stranger, picking up a newspaper and casting his eye over it. “The first time, sir,” answered Bradshaw, eyeing the interrogator more closely. He was an attenuated, dyspeptic person, with a suspicious glance, and a hurried and abrupt manner. Bradshaw at once discovered he was a character, and it struck him that he wished to communicate something or other, but did not well know how to begin. Half musingly and half attentively, Bradshaw answered him as he continued his interrogatories. 18* “Much talent there, sir?” “Not any marked individual talent—there's rather a democracy of it—it's pretty nearly equally distributed.” “A democracy of talent!—ugh, ugh!—you go in for democracy, do you?” “For a democracy of rights,” said Bradshaw, smiling at the oddness of the stranger, “but—” “Sir,” exclaimed the stranger, “you have the notions of the—ugh!—of the French revolutionists —sorry to know it, sir—sorry to know it.” “You didn't hear me out; I was going to say,— but I believed that nature was opposed to a democracy of talent,—I'm not exactly a French revolutionist, for I don't agree with him, who, when some member of the national convention of France, called Mirabeau, the `distinguished member,' jumped up in a rage, and exclaimed—`they had no distinguished members there, they were all equal!”' “Ha! ha!—ugh—I like that much—never saw that before—must remember that—good many young men of your profession here, I suppose, Mr. Bradshaw?” “Yes, sir, any quantity of them—if you have professional business you can have your pick of some dozens.” “Some dozens, hey, ugh!—Fine place, I suppose, to study the law.” “That's problematical—there are too many temptations here to allure one away from study.” “Yes, I thought so. Most young men, who come here from other states, disregard parents, guardians, and every body else, hey,—and take to frolicking. Do you know, Mr. Bradshaw,—ugh! ugh!—do you know—” “Halloo, Bradshaw, I'm glad to see you back again!” exclaimed Selman, throwing open the office-door. “Ah! Mr. Benedict,” exclaimed Bradshaw— “my respects to you.” And they shook each other cordially by the hand. “Bradshaw, you look a little thin. Have you seen Kentuck? That's a pretty will, isn't it, of that uncle of his. Bradshaw, what'll he do?” “Do!—why, practise his profession—It will be better than vegetating upon a fortune! Don't you think so, Judge?” continued Bradshaw, addressing Cavendish, who, at this moment, called to welcome him home. “Think what?” asked the Judge. “Why, that Willoughby will do better without a fortune, than with one.” “Think!—by Jove!—I think the carcass of that uncle should be hung as high as Haman's. Willoughby is of a most respectable family—he is the only living representative:—the old fool, I have no doubt, was crazy. Willoughby always represented him as a man of sense, with peculiarities, but possessed of a strong mind. I have no doubt he was crack-brained from the first—the will, I believe, could be broken—I've a great mind just to slip out to the west (I've long had a notion of going there to see the country) and inquire into the business. Willoughby says, the letter informing him of the death, is from an intimate friend of his uncle, and that there can be no mistake in it.—But, I tell you what, that intimate friend may have been too intimate! Do you doubt, he has been left a large legacy. It's preposterous to believe that any uncle, having his senses, would disinherit such a nephew as Willoughby, his only blood relation in the world —the only one of his family—an ancient family— to endow a hospital for lunatics. He must have been a lunatic himself.” “I believe you're half right, Judge,” exclaimed Selman. “What do you think, Bradshaw?” “The Judge may be near the truth,” replied Bradshaw—“his uncle's a poor devil. But if it be as we fear, Willoughby has talents and energy; and, making a fortune, and winning with it an honourable name, will be better than stagnating with a dukedom.” “Stagnating with a devildom!” exclaimed Cavendish. “Willoughby ought to have the inheritance. This poverty is no such easy matter, Mr. Bradshaw.” “Why, Judge—I know it,” remarked Bradshaw; and, after musing several minutes, he continued—“that will ought to be looked into— you're right—I have nothing particular to prevent my taking a jaunt with you, if you go west —what I meant to imply was, that Kentuck's situation is not so bad, after all. He has talents and a profession; and while he and his friends should use every exertion to recover his fortune, he nor they should not mope on the loss of it. “Judge,” continued Bradshaw, with a peculiar smile, “where is there a man with a large fortune that the people delight to honour? Fortune does not bear away the honours of our land: luxuries and superfluities, of course, it gives, but not the luxuries and superfluities of renown—public estimation, political power, or legal skill: these are the luxuries of mental wealth. I have been cogitating, ever since I saw Kentuck, upon his loss of fortune. No man, that I have ever known, would do more honour to a princely estate than Kentuck. Without being the least prodigal, or living in enervating luxuries, he would devote his income to the enjoyment of those around him—and, in this, find much of his own; he would be public-spirited and generous, and would improve his mental gifts, without devoting them to acquire fame or power: thus, he would pass through life, respected and beloved. But, believing, as I do, that Kentuck has great natural talents; forcing his own way, as he will now have to force it, I have no doubt (at least, I hope —for Kentuck, to tell the truth, is not of a very ambitious nature) that he will stand among the first men in the country. I cherish these reflections when I think of the conduct of the heartless old fool—his uncle. If Kentuck had been a cringing, time-serving Blifil of a fellow, he would have got every cent of that old rascal's money. Yes, if he had truckled to him, and watched his humours, like a slave, and eschewed frankness and honour, and nobility of character, he would now be the possessor of a cool million.” “He'll find out his true friends now,” said Cavendish. “How some of the old mothers, who have been courting him for their dear daughters, will cool off; and, notwithstanding Kentuck is such a good-looking fellow, I fear the daughters will cool too.” “Come,” said Bradshaw, starting up; “Lyons has a branch of his firm at —, in the west, and he knows Kentuck's uncle. He can give us some information that will be of service, perhaps. Kentuck bears it like a man; he has such a sensitive and high honour, and his feelings have been so wounded, not by the loss of his fortune, but by the neglect of his uncle, that he had better remain here; for, were he to go, if there has been any fraud in the will, the wrong-doers would be thrown upon their guard by his presence, which might defeat the ends of justice;—on the contrary, no one would suspect any thing from our visit. I like your thought, Judge; and we must put it in execution at once.” The young men had been so busied in Kentuck's loss, that they did not remark the presence of the stranger, who sat reading the newspaper. Bradshaw, thinking of him for the first time since the entrance of his friends, said:—“Keep your seat, sir;—the paper is at your service. I will return in a few minutes, and, if you have any business with me, I will then attend to it. Come,” addressing Cavendish, “let's go and see Lyons; we may learn something from him, and if there is any thing to strengthen your suspicions, Judge, why, Westward Ho!” The young men left the office together. They were no sooner gone, than the old gentleman started up, exclaiming—“Poor devil!—ugh! ugh!—of an uncle, hey—believe I am. My nephew's the only one that gives me a good character; put on black for me, though he was disinherited! that hurt me worse—ugh! ugh!—than if he had cursed me. Yes, I am a poor devil; and I have been deceived, like a poor devil:—but I'll make him amends. He's popular, why, he's very popular; and this keen eyed fellow thinks he has first rate talents,—so they all thought at home. I'll leave him every cent I have—yes, I'll deed it. He put—ugh! ugh!—on black for me, though I did disinherit him: I'll deed it, so that I can't alter my mind. I've been deceived by Dodridge—that greasy, godly, Christless, rascal. I must speak to this Bradshaw, and tell him every thing—or he'll be out to the west, and proclaim me a fool and a poor devil, through the whole country.” The old gentleman was interrupted in his train of reflections by the entrance of Nancy Mulvany, the apple woman. “Where's Bradshaw?” she exclaimed, resting her apple basket on the edge of the table. “I thought he was in.” “Be in presently, I expect, good woman. What's the price of apples?” “Two cents a-piece, and four for a fip. I'm tired out!” and she threw herself into a chair. “Two cents a-piece, and four for a fip—that's a devil of a price!” “Devil of a price!—they were as dear agin this time last year.” “They were, hey! I can get them in Kentucky for a fip a peck,—what do you think of that, good woman?” “Don't good woman me; my name's Nancy Mulvany. Ye're not in Kentucky now; and, if you want apples at a fip a peck, ye must go to Kentucky for 'em. I wouldn't, woman as I am, carry 'em for that.” “You wouldn't, hey!—ugh! ugh!—good woman —ugh!” “Don't good woman me, I tell ye.” “Well, bad woman, then—ugh!” “Man!” said Nancy, starting up, “I don't know ye; and if ye want to pass an insult, say so. I don't believe ye're from Kentucky, at all.” “Why not, Mrs. Mul—what's your name?” “Because I never knew a Kentuck, but what was a gentleman. Young Willoughby—Kentuck they call him—wouldn't own ye.” “May be I wouldn't own him, Mrs. Mul. What kind of a man may he be?” “The right kind of a man!—true to the back bone, and ginrous and just.” “Let me have a fip's worth of your apples, if you please, Mrs. Mul—ma'am.” “I think ye'll like 'em,” said Nancy, softening down, as she handed him the basket; “help yerself—ye're from the far away state of Kentucky. Did ye know Kentuck—I mean young Willoughby?” “Why, yes—I believe, mayhap I did—ugh! ugh!” “Well, I hope to goodness gracious ye've come to comfort him. His uncle, they say, what had a large fortune, and was to leave it all to him, is dead and gone, and not left him the first cent.— It's a sin and shame, that it should be so—a sin and shame. His uncle must ha' bin a weak-minded creatur.” “Is young Willoughby—what kind of a man is young Willoughby, ma'am—ugh! ugh!” “What, Kentuck! why him and Bradshaw is, among men, like them two big pippins there, among my apples, the best of the whole on 'em.” “I've heard of Bradshaw.” “Heard of Bradshaw! every body what has ears has heard of him—and may hear him, too, of a court-day. It would do you good—he can beat the best at this bar; and it isn't me only that says it—every body says it. These apples came off of his father's farm—and a fine farm it is; and they're fine folks. His sister is the right kind of a young lady, I tell ye. When two young men are thick, and one has a sister—there's the reason—may be,” said Nancy, knowingly. “Ugh! ugh!—what's that, what's that! good woman?” “It may be, and it mayn't be,” said Nancy, lifting up her basket, “but I mus'n't stay on the gossip all day. And ye're for seeing Bradshaw, are ye— he'll do your lawing for you as good as airy one, any where, ye may depend. I wish I could see him; I've missed him mightily—but he'll be in the court in the day. Ye'll find them good apples—I must—there's Beck, now, gaping along, the lazy varmint. Beck, ye hussy, take this basket to the court;”—and Nancy hurried out—handed the basket to her, and followed after. As our readers have discovered, the letter to Vol. II. 19 Willoughby, announcing the death of his uncle, and his disinheritance, was an artifice practised by the uncle himself. The uncle was a suspicious, wayward man; full of odd notions and inconsistencies. One of his strong suspicions (in which there was much more truth than in many other of his whimsicalities,) was, that the attentions he received were for his wealth; and though the world showed him a respect on that account, which they else would not have shown, yet he was wrong in attributing the regard of his nephew to that score.— This, to do him justice, he was slow to do; and, if his nephew had remained in Kentucky, the suspicion, if awakened in his mind, would only have passed over it, like a cloud over the sunny face of nature, without making any impression; but Dodridge, a canting hypocrite, who lived near him, anxious to displace the nephew in the uncle's regard, in the hopes of being his heir, and knowing he could not succeed while the nephew was daily with his uncle, persuaded the old gentleman to send him to an eastern law-school. Willoughby, desirous of visiting the eastern states, and wholly unsuspicious of the design of Dodridge, was delighted with his uncle's proposition, and gladly complied with his wishes. In his absence, the sly and insidious knave, watchful of every favourable opportunity in the gloomy and suspicious moods of the uncle, undermined, by a process, too tedious and contemptible to dwell upon, his belief in the affection of his nephew. After he determined to disinherit him, his conscience smote him; and he got a friend to write the letter which the nephew received; and went on by the same mail to learn his character and conduct while away, and to discover, in a disguise which he had assumed, the state of his nephew's feelings towards him. His name was Chesterton, (he was Willoughby's maternal uncle,) and in the inquiries which he made, on his arrival in the city, he heard Bradshaw spoken of in the highest terms, and that he was the most intimate friend of his nephew; his purpose, therefore, in visiting him was to hear, by indirect means, of Willoughby; but he did not know well how to break the ice; for being of a suspicious nature, as we have said, he feared he might be suspected himself. When Willoughby entered Bradshaw's office, while Mr. Chesterton was there, and communicated to his friend his supposed loss of fortune, he did not notice his uncle at all, nor would he, in all probability, have known him, if he had, as he supposed him dead. Mr. Chesterton felt a deep humiliation, when he heard his nephew speak of him as he did, and saw him in mourning for his disinheritor; and, but for a sense of shame in the presence of Bradshaw, he would have made himself known to his nephew, and have explained to him how he had been deceived by Dodridge; but, as it was, he left the office, fearful that Willoughby might recognise him. He called on Bradshaw again, anxious to hear more of his nephew, and then he heard what Willoughby's friends said, as we have recorded. It had been his purpose to return to Kentucky, without making himself known to Willoughby, and, after deeding his property to him, to explain the whole matter by letter; but when he heard Cavendish and Bradshaw consulting on going west, to inquire into the will, and saw them leave the office in fartherance of that intention, with many a cough, and much worriment of shame —for such characters are very sensitive to ridicule —he resolved to await the return of Bradshaw, and confide in him. Accordingly, he remained until Bradshaw returned, and narrated to him all of what our readers have been informed. Bradshaw listened in silent surprise: his first emotion was heart-felt joy for Willoughby, and then he felt, in no small degree provoked with himself, that his sagacity should have been so completely asleep as not in the least to have remarked the stranger, except for a nervous old fellow, who had some molehill of a matter to consult him upon, which, in his own estimation, amounted to a mountain. “And so you think I am a poor devil!” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton, snappishly, after waiting some moments for a remark from Bradshaw. “O! no, Mr. Chesterton,” said Bradshaw, blandly: “you remember you have not disinherited your nephew—you are not dead, sir. You mean to make your nephew your heir—and I hope you may live long. I have no doubt you will outlive every shadow of suspicion of the regard of your nephew. A man of wealth, sir, is too apt to be courted for his wealth; and it is proper and rational that he should endeavour to find out who are his real friends—who have a true affection for him. You have found out your nephew, and you have found out Dodridge.” “Found out Dodridge!” exclaimed the old gentleman, starting up with a flashing eye,— “ugh! ugh!—Yes, sir, I have found him out, and he'll find me out with a vengeance—the half-methodist, half-quaker, whole-hog knave. To make me, his best friend, act so like a fool, like a poor devil—ugh! ugh!—Your phrase was proper, Mr. Bradshaw—but, sir, I'll fix him. The first time I catch him on my farm, I'll make a will, and prove it on his non-combatant—ugh!—pious back. I'll be witness, judge, and jury—my black man Tom, shall be executioner. I'll inflict thirty-nine on him, or my name's not Chesterton— ugh!—he shall give a receipt for it—ugh!—that it was well laid on. Let him go to law; I'll pay the fine—ugh! ugh!—it will be in place of the property I meant to have left him: that'll be his legacy, Mr. Bradshaw; and he'll have to leg it off of my farm, in double quick time, or—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I'll double it—ugh! ugh! ugh.— Where's Willy, I wonder—my nephew, Willy. I want to see him, and I hate to see him, too. The dog would put on mourning for me, though I am a poor devil, and did disinherit him—but, where is he?” “I suspect he rode out to my father's, sir. If you will ride with me—'tis but a few miles—I have no doubt we will find him there.” Mr. Chesterton readily assented; for he was very quick and impulsive in all his feelings, as we have said. On their way to the Purchase, he asked Bradshaw innumerable questions of his family, &amp;c., which, aware as Bradshaw was of Willoughby's attachment to his sister, he frankly answered, 19* though without speaking of that. The old gentleman was in raptures with his free, easy, and courteous manners; and, before they reached the Purchase, Bradshaw had reconciled him to himself, which, of course, prepared him to be pleased. Willoughby, and Mr. Bradshaw, sen., as we have related, left old Pete to his reflections in the carriage-house. They entered the dwelling, and found Emily alone. Mr. Bradshaw placed Emily's hand in Willoughby's, blessed them with a fervent and holy blessing, and left the room to find his wife. The lovers, left alone, strolled out together,—for the spring was again coming,— happy in themselves, and forgetful of all else. “My dear Emily,” said Willoughby, as she placed her arm in his, and gently and fondly pressed it to him—“my dear Emily, you have, indeed, made me happy. Out of what seemed the greatest misfortune of my life, has arisen the greatest blessing. Yet it is selfish in me, love, in my poverty, to woo you—and O! how unselfish in you to be thus won.” “Selfish!—why selfish?” said Emily, clasping her hands together, and thus, as it were, locking herself to his arm while she looked up into his face. How soon love, like theirs, when once acknowledged, becomes confiding of its every thought! “No!—I am the selfish one: for it gives me more pleasure—more selfish pleasure— to show the world I love you for yourself, than your wealth could possibly have given me.” I am, indeed, rich, in such a love—that gentle heart of thine, this fairy little hand are mine— mine—am I not rich? Do you know, Emily,” continued he, smiling, “that my self-opinion has grown beyond all bounds, to-day. If, hereafter, it is remarked, that my vanity grew great, when I grew poor, it will be your fault—and you know your father tells us, and my father, love, that it is a great sin—think what you have to answer for.” “You grow a flatterer, like brother Clinton.— How much you reminded me of him, then—O! there he is now, in a gig! Who can that gentleman be who has left him, and is advancing towards us?” Willoughby and Emily were walking in a path-way, that led through an orchard in sight of the lane. Bradshaw had pointed out Willoughby to Mr. Chesterton, and the old gentleman immediately declared he would join him; jumping from the gig, almost before Bradshaw had time to check the horse, he hurried towards him. “Nephew!” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton, as he drew near the lovers; “nephew! don't you know me? It's all a d—d hoax—I'm not dead—ugh— ugh—you're my heir—every cent, every cent— ugh—Dodridge is a knave.” In an instant, nephew and uncle were in each other's arms. “Willy, Willy—ugh—ugh—my noble boy, you must forget and forgive—I'll make amends—every cent—ugh—every cent—Dodridge's an infernal scoundrel—In mourning for your old uncle—hey, boy—the only one that didn't abuse me—I'm sorry—sorry;” and the old man sobbed aloud. “No matter, uncle,” said Willoughby; “you were right to try me, if you thought my affection for you was feigned. Uncle,” continued Willoughby, after a pause, in which neither spoke, “you have been all your life trying to find one who would love you for yourself alone—You have advised me to seek such a one. I have succeeded, uncle: I told this lady— Miss Bradshaw, uncle—whom I have long loved— I told her to-day, for the first time, of my love and of my poverty, as I thought, and she told me she loved me for myself—did you not, Emily?” Miss Bradshaw would have been very much embarrassed, not knowing how Mr. Chesterton, who struck her, as he did every one else, as being a very singular man, might regard her, had he not instantly exclaimed, taking her hand at the same time, “Happy to see you, miss—I've heard of you. And so the dog was determined to be happy in spite of me, hey,—and you are content to be happy with him, without a cent from his old uncle— ugh! ugh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Mary Carlton was still at Washington with her father. Congress was holding one of its long sessions, and she wrote to Emily Bradshaw, she was desirous to get home once more, but her father insisted upon her staying with him, until the adjournment of congress, when he would return to Oak Park, (the name of his estate adjoining the Purchase,) and spend the summer there. “Home, home, home,” she wrote in her letter, “I am almost crazy to get home.” “There is no place like home,” I sing the song so often, that I really believe the folks here begin to think I know no other. Oh! how I long to see you all. How is Mrs. Penelope Selman? and what does she think of matrimony? and how does her loving lord bear the yoke connubial? How she used to worry him! does she worry him still? and how in the name of love, and matrimony does he bear it! And how is our friend Kentuck?—I beg pardon, I remember with what precision you always called him, Mr. Wil-lough-by. What pro-di-gi-ous dignity some ladies have on some occasions! Emily, Emily, you're sly, very, very sly. You mention Ken— Mr. Wil-lough-by, so seldom in your letters, and with such an indifferent kind of a style, that one would think, who didn't know you, and who didn't know our sex, that he was the most casual acquaintance in the world. Do you remember that Miss Edith Bellenden, in Old Mortality, in writing to her uncle, the major, speaks of trumpery novels, and such gear in her letter, and only has a word or two in the postscript, for the danger of her lover Morton? Now you are a heroine, very much like Miss Edith Bellenden, I take it, Miss Emily Bradshaw.— I've heard it all from Penelope: she wrote me a long letter the very moment she heard it—on the afternoon of the day when Ken—Mr. Wil-lough-by's uncle, what a strange man, went to the Purchase with Clinton—does Mr. Clinton ride ghosts about? Is the uncle a vampire?—And so you accepted the poor disinherited knight, when he hadn't a cent? how provoking, that you will have to be the richest bride in the country. You were so much in the pouts, when you heard it was all a sham, that you could not write to me, I suppose; you'll now play Miss Lydia Languish, of course, and lead your lover a life of it. Or will you just be married in a plain kind of a way, and no more of it? Penelope is deeply interested for you. She tells me, Mr. Wil-lough-by is the most devoted lover extant. Well, I once thought that your devotion to your pilgrim-name, was so great you would never change it. But then there is so much chivalry and constancy in a Kentuckian—and such a Kentuckian! How did he make his declaration, Emily? He told you, with a most funereal face, he was not worth one cent, and you “loved him for himself alone?” Where did you own the “soft impeachment?”—in the country, I hope, for the sake of all “true loviers.” Apropos; a gentleman had the—what shall I call it—you now are a judge and can decide? had the — to tell me the other day, making a quotation from Halleck to express himself, that, think of his impudence, Emily, for ain't it impudence? that a declaration, when a girl truly loved the declarer, sounded to her, “—Welcome as the cry, That told the Indian Isles were night, To the world—seeking Genoese— When the land breeze from woods of palm, And orange groves, and fields of balm, Blew o'er the Haytian seas.” “`World-seeking!' well, we seek a world, when we seek true love; for the `world of the heart' is all the world to us. What, though we find that world—too often, like the Genoese, we meet with cold neglect.—I declare now, isn't that an envious reflection, considering under what circumstances I write to you? Pray, has such a world been discovered yet? are you upon the voyage, and do you mean to be the discoverer? That is, are you sanguine as to that point? Envy again. “Congratulate me! I have an old beau here. Understand; not one who has been paying his distresses to me for a long time, and is, therefore, an old beau, but one who has seen the olden time, a man of eld, as ancient, to be as limited in the computation of his years as truth will possibly admit, as ancient as my father, and looking, at least, twenty years older. Fancy me cocking up my chin, while I write the name of the Honourable James Wortley, Secretary of the —! He has a very large fortune!! he lives here in great style!!! he is an aspirant to the presidency!!!! My father and the Honourable Secretary are as thick as two lovers. My father eulogizes the Secretary in a good set speech three times a-day; namely, at breakfast, dinner, and supper; and between whiles, he drags him into his discourse so often that I suspect the discourse is frequently made for the sake of the parenthesis, as Miss Edith Bellenden's letter was written that she might append to it a postscript. Let me inform you, nevertheless, that though he is ancient of days, he is an agreeable and intellectual man; but you know his reputation. You have only heard of his talents—his great political knowledge, &amp;c., &amp;c. You ought to see himself. Could you ever abide your courtly cold man, except at a birth-night ball? You ought to see him, as I say—yes, you must see him: I shall bring him in my train, ahem! to Oak Park, that you may. I shall have him dye his hair first of a raven black—it is now of a blue-black—his last dye not being good—with, here and there, a grayish streak, like the silk that I wore the last time you saw me, and got stained— hold himself very erect—he always is erect, when he thinks of the weight of years he carries—and of this your blooming presence will remind him— get his coat judiciously padded, a new set of teeth, and, after this preparation, now, that I know you have been won, you shall see him. He shall put on his fascinations, but not all of them; for I would not throw Mr. Willoughby in the shade completely. You shall see what I have done at Washington:—and, if you had not thrown yourself away on a wild Kentuckian, I meant, on my return, to have taught you and two or three other girls, good and true, of our set, my trick of winning hearts; and, like Captain Bobadil, (I have been to the theatre so often, that you see all my thoughts find resemblances there.—Oh! for the green fields once more,) with his select company, we would kill off any number of men, `by computation.'—`By computation!' Ay, when you see my beau putting his best foot foremost—it will be his left, for he has lately had a twinge of the gout in the right, which has swollen it considerably, and made him limp on that side—it will be impossible for you to tell how many years he computes—as impossible as it is to compute the number of worldly advantages which my dear papa thinks will result from—no, I won't say the word. It takes two to make a bargain, it is said, and, therefore, papa and the Honourable Secretary, being two, think they have made a bargain on certain persons being one, but—would you believe it?—it takes three to make the bargain I speak of. Wait till we meet—I'll keep you awake a whole night listening. “Do, my dear Emily, in consideration of my father's health and mine, and of the young gentleman's who will attend us—some day when you are walking with Mr. Wil-lough-by—he caring not whither, so you walk with him—do wend your way to Oak Park, and see—oh, what a climax!—that the rooms are well aired. Do, now,—there's a Vol. II. 20 good girl—and for your reward, be gentle love about your pillow. May he—the boy—love, I mean, why was he not a girl?—or, to please prudes, why not it?—may he seek your lattice with the dew of fairest flowers upon his wing, and leave it on your lip to be stolen, when you are willing. Don't you think I want an `ounce'—no, a pound `of civet, to sweeten my imagination.' Don't let Priscilla Perry see this letter for the world. Don't read this part to Penelope, for she will, in her mischief, repeat it to Priscilla, and I shall depart from her good graces for ever, but not before that `good apothecary' has dosed me to death with lectures on propriety. “This moment, John came in, and gave me your letter. My dear, dear Emily, you deserve to be happy, and indeed you will be. The most romance-loving lady in the land would be satisfied with your fate. “`O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west!' “Kentuck is a noble fellow. Do you know you will be envied by every girl in the country—except one? It is so romantic, I laid down my pen, and cried and laughed for an hour. I shall soon be home, but I see how it is, we shall roam no more together over the Purchase. Three's bad company. Well, ma'am, do you mean to live in Kentuck? I mean the state. No! no! Emily, that must not be; it must be stipulated in the bond that you do not leave us. Mr. Willoughby has no relative but his uncle, and he must be content to remain. Wait till I get home. We girls must make the old gentleman as pleased as Punch with himself, and with us, and keep him. If he says he wont stay, and expects to take you with him, I will invite him out to take a walk with me, inveigle him by the bank of the deepest part of the branch, and give him a sly push in, and so end the matter; for you must not, must not leave us. But I know your father and mother could not part with you—oh, how I have been worrying myself, for fear you would leave us. “Tell Clinton, that his canal speech has been republished here very handsomely, in pamphlet form, and that it sells like a novel, that Mr. Clay quoted from it yesterday with high compliments, that grave senators explore it with curious eyes— that fair ladies repeat the beautiful extracts—and last, though not least, that no less a personage than your humble servant, whenever she hears him puffed, takes unto herself the honour of boasting of his acquaintance, and becomes garrulous of the accomplishments, address, colloquial talents, oratorical powers, flashing eye, and brave bearing of Clinton Bradshaw, Esquire; for all which personal praise, be it known to him, through you, he is indebted to my imagination—which don't choose to stop at trifles, when it gets a going—as he may see in the above sentence. “Give my love to your kind dear father and mother; tell them I am happiest at the Purchase. I am tired of the dissipation and heartlessness around me. Remember me to every living thing on the Purchase—to old Pete, and aunt Sally, and all the race of Pete's young and old. I'll tell you of a weakness of mine, last night—for weakness it would be called here, and whenever I want to make myself an object of ridicule in this community, I'll tell it. You know how often we have knelt at your dear mother's knee, and said, `Our Father who art in Heaven,' after her, and how often since we have said it together? Last night, I was at a brilliant party. I had, just before going, heard pleasing things of you—of home; there they were repeated. I felt a strange giddy excitement. Arrived at our rooms, when the party was over, I threw myself on my pillow, while facts and fancies whirled through my brain wildly. I fell, at last, asleep, and awoke in the night, after an unhappy dream—it struck me I had not said `Our Father'—it was the first time I had neglected it since we knelt at your mother's knee. It made me feel so wretched that it was hours before I sobbed myself to sleep. I am feverish and unwell to-day; but it is the dissipation of this place, which, thank heaven, will soon be over. I have scribbled all this just to relieve myself. “God bless you, my dear, dear Emily. “M. C.” “P. S. You are right. You always told me you preferred Mr. Willoughby's society to any other gentleman's—you never said you loved him—and I don't know that any girl should confess it even to herself—if she could help it, Emily, until my gentleman has plumply and in good set terms made his declaration—but alas! love, like murder, will out. M. C.” Mr. Chesterton (Willoughby's uncle,) had become a guest at the Purchase. He talked sometimes of returning to Kentucky to look after his estate; but the fear of the ridicule that would attach to him, when the circumstances attending his pretended death and endowment of an hospital were known—(the friend who had written the letter announcing his death to Willoughby, was held to secrecy, but Chesterton feared the report would travel to the west)—kept him no unwilling guest at the Purchase. Emily's gentleness and beauty won his regard, and the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Bradshaw impressed him with a great respect for them. Clinton, he said, would make a marvel of a man if he wasn't such a d—d democrat. The old gentleman prided himself upon his aristocratic opinions. To his nephew, Mr. Chesterton was abundantly kind, it was evident he was making every reparation in his power for his mistrust of him. Sometimes, when he thought of Dodridge, he was restiff to put his threat into execution; but, upon the main, he was more contented than he had been for years. He bustled into town to hear the news, and by the time he had chatted with Bradshaw and half quarrelled with his Jeffersonianism, and strolled around, his cough would come on, he would say, and then he would be off, in a hurry, for the Purchase, that he might get where there was quietness and recruit. He averred himself descended from an expatriated cavalier, who left England in the troubles of Cromwell's time, and settled in Virginia, and thence, he said, his ancestors emigrated to Kentucky. He said he never liked the Puritans till he saw Emily Bradshaw, and now he considered it providential that he had crossed the mountains, and 20* his nephew was to make such a match—for it was good with men and horses—ugh! ugh!—to cross the breed; and he was a great judge of horse-flesh. Clinton Bradshaw knew how to humour him, to a fraction, and to draw him out. At first, Mr. Bradshaw had as strong a repugnance to Mr. Chesterton as one of his chastened feelings and Christian charity could entertain against any one; but it gave place, when he came to know him better, to other emotions. Notwithstanding Mr. Chesterton would occasionally express some heathenish opinion, or let slip an oath, he daily more and more suppressed the one, and coughed lustily when he found himself on the eve of uttering the other; and, in a short time, there grew to be a real liking between them. Mr. Bradshaw saw his daughter's affections were deeply engaged by Willoughby, and that the Kentuckian loved her with the full fervour of a manly heart; and he was extremely solicitous that all should harmonize. He could not bear the thought of separating from his daughter. Mrs. Bradshaw told the uncle that it must not be—she could not part with Emily. Willoughby, in compliance with Emily's wishes, and in obedience to his own, said he meant permanently to locate himself with Emily's relatives; and it was agreed that, after they were married, if Mr. Chesterton wished, they would make a visit west with him. Mr. Chesterton, at first, expressed himself very desirous that his nephew, when married, should live in the west; but, having no relatives there, he daily became more and more weaned from it, and wedded to his new friends. He would frequently aver, among the neighbours, with whom he soon became very familiar and talkative, that he liked the old Puritan, as he called Mr. Bradshaw, much; and that, if he were put upon his oath, he would say Mr. Bradshaw was the most honest man he had ever met with. “A good man,” he pronounced him, “but a d—d Puritan. We agree now like two pick-pockets; but if he and I had lived in old Noll's time, and had met, we'd have fought with a vengeance.” In the evenings, at the Purchase, while the lovers would stroll away, or sit apart, Mr. Bradshaw and son, and Mr. Chesterton, would hold long conversations “on things in general,” as the latter gentleman expressed it, “and on methodism, farming, John Wesley, Puritanism, the settlement of New England and Virginia, and the revolutionary war, with a host of other matters, in particular.” Mr. Chesterton had read and travelled much; he had a shrewd perception of character, where his passions were not concerned, and he delighted to expatiate upon it. Nothing pleased Clinton more than to get him upon that topic, for he would show off all his own eccentricities in describing those of others; while he thanked God, with the sincerest belief, “that he had not—ugh! ugh!—an oddity, whim-wham, peculiarity, or eccentricity, in the world. “This having a ridiculous point,” he would say, “about one is no joke, gentlemen—no joke—understand me—to yourselves, though others may find great fun in it.” Emily, leaning on Willoughby's arm, often took the path-way to the park, to superintend the household arrangements for her friend. The Kentuckian was always by her side. Thus, weeks passed away. In the mean time, the following paragraph, from the pen of a Washington correspondent, who was esteemed accurate, went the rounds: “Among the things that are to be, rumour says the Hon. Samuel Carlton will be elected to fill the vacancy in the Senate, occasioned by the resignation of — —, who has been appointed a judge. Mr. Carlton, however, will have a powerful competitor in General Murray, whose revolutionary services were arduous and self-sacrificing. It is said that Mr. Wortley, who is from Mr. Carlton's state, will throw his influence in the scale of Carlton; and the honourable secretary, from appearances and report, has good and sufficient reason therefor. Mr. Carlton's daughter, who has been the reigning belle here all this winter, and who deserves all the praise her beauty and accomplishments have won her, is to bestow her hand—so rumour says, and appearances justify it—on the honourable secretary. This match, though equal in other respects, is not in years—the secretary, however, does his best to prevent and repair the dilapidations of time. At all hours, he may be seen beside the blooming beauty, whose sprightly vivacity and wit seem to impart new life to him. He seems no longer deeply immersed in politics.” Clinton Bradshaw, carelessly, in the court-house, picked up the newspaper; and glancing his eye over it, fell on the above paragraph. He betrayed an emotion, which, he had schooled himself to believe, required sterner things to start. He had scarcely calmed the disquiet of his brow, when Cavendish (the court had not been called yet, and the members of the bar were lounging around their desks,) went up to him, where he was seated, with a number of young men near, and asked— “Bradshaw, have you heard the news from Washington?” The `from Washington,' put Bradshaw on his guard, but— “The stream that seems to thee so still, Hath such a tide below!” In an indifferent tone he asked, “what news?” “Why, that Mary Carlton is to marry Mr. Wortley.” “Heard it! to be sure I have—listen;” and Bradshaw read the paragraph from the letter. While he read, the young men gathered around him. He betrayed no emotion in reading, and when he finished, observed— “There, gentlemen, our richest heiress, and loveliest lady's gone—and my old schoolmate, too, whom I have beaued so often, and talked so much romance to.” “Bradshaw, confound it,” said Cavendish, provoked at his manner, “I thought you were in love with her.” “We were schoolmates, you know, Judge, and— but I don't tell tales out of school—particularly on myself. Miss Carlton has fascinations that would make a lover of a stoic, but— “`What care I how kind she be, If she be not kind to me?”' “Bradshaw, I shall suspect you of puppyism, if you speak in this indifferent tone of a lady whom you have known so long; and— “Why, Judge—these gentlemen, judge us, judge —the fair lady has made as great a hole in your heart as in mine. Here's an admirable critique on Booth, in Richard, the night before last: I become stage-struck whenever I see him.” “Bradshaw,” said Cavendish, without heeding his last remark, “it must be true; Talbot is just from Washington, and he swears to it. It is preposterous to think she would marry that old man— it's January and May.” “Well, Judge, though it is preposterous, May wedded January, you know; the blooming rose was encircled by the snow. What a cold embrace! The snow did its best to melt; the widow's mite is as acceptable in the eye of charity as the rich man's gold; and why may not the withered heart be as acceptable in the court of love as one as full of blood, and buoyant passions, even as your honour's.” Thus will wounded pride jest with what is dearest to it. “When did Mr. Talbot arrive?” asked Bradshaw. “Last night: he has been nearly all winter at Washington. “Ay! has he been a worshipper?—knelt he at the shrine?” “I suspect he did. Here's Talbot, now,” said Cavendish. Since the affair between Bradshaw and Talbot in the court-house Restaurateur, they had been on speaking terms, and Talbot had made advances to sociability, which Bradshaw received without reciprocating, but with the easy unembarrassed manner which characterized him. Talbot advanced to the circle, and was greeted by his acquaintances. He offered his hand to Bradshaw, which he took, and asked— “What news from the capitol, Mr. Talbot?—you bring sad tidings to the Judge and me. We have been rivals for many years for Miss Carlton's smile; and, from what we hear, we have agreed to pronounce the grapes sour.” Talbot had joined the group when he saw Bradshaw with the intention of telling the news, and enjoying his dismay. He was, therefore, astonished, suspecting, as he did, Bradshaw's feelings, at his tone of easy raillery. “My tidings are from the newspapers, sir,” said Talbot. “Ay, coming fresh from Washington, we feared you had some more authentic source of information—Judge, there's hopes for us yet—these lying letter writers will say any thing. Have you any idea, Mr. Talbot, who wrote the letter?” “Me—I—not I, sir.” “Understand me, sir,” said Bradshaw, archly— “I do not say that you wrote the letter—though your friends here have given you credit for many of the letters that have appeared in this journal— they have been very accurate and very acute— the letters, I mean.” With a heart ill at ease, Bradshaw left the court-house. “Can it be,” thought he, “that—no—'tis false. But then to have her name coupled with Wortley's in that manner—the tone of the letter insinuates her willingness—yes, by heaven, Talbot wrote that letter. In her letter to Emily she laughs at Wortley—but a woman—who can read a woman!—It cannot be—she has a hold on my very heart-strings. What a gentle passion love is, when undisturbed!—but mistrust plants daggers in the heart. He who loves with his whole soul, and acts nobly, amidst rivalry, suspicions, and morbid misgivings, has a god-like spirit. Wortley and Carlton have some political scheme between them—I have no doubt. Carlton wants to be senator, and Wortley aspires,—heaven save the mark!—to the presidency, and to the daughter—I'm told he's subtle as a serpent. Her father has suspicions of our attachment. If I am re-elected to the legislature, for whom go I for senator? there's the rub— Mary will soon be home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. When Congress adjourned, Miss Carlton, in the charge of a friend, left the capitol, for her native city, while her father passed with Mr. Wortley, into the interior of the state, where that gentleman lived before he was appointed Secretary of the —. These gentlemen were on an electioneering tour. It was their intention, after travelling through the state, to spend the remainder of the summer at Oak Park, where Mr. Wortley was to be the guest of Mr. Carlton. Mr. Carlton had set his heart, or rather, his head, on making a match between his daughter and Mr. Wortley; and that gentleman, full of politics and the tender passion, was travelling with his father-in-law, that was to be, as his sanguine hopes flattered him, with the double purpose of recruiting his good looks for the court of love, and his party for the election day. 'Twas a beautiful spring afternoon, and the inmates of the Purchase were partaking of its enjoyment. Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. Chesterton, and Clinton, were sitting before the door in conversation; and within sight, straying through the orchard, were Willoughby and Emily Bradshaw. Young Pete had just passed the door, on his way to bring up the cows, whistling as he went to the dog, that like Vol. II. 21 a well-fed animal of more pretensions, had been napping away the hours after dinner. Jowler, at Pete's call, started up, looked round, stretched his legs fore and aft until his back formed a hollow, gave himself a shake, looked after Pete for a moment, and then turned his tail on him, and entered his house, in a manner that said as plainly as any dog's manner could say, “Pete, I can't go with you, this evening.” Jowler had scarcely entered his house, when he jumped out, barking quickly:— at the same instant young Pete called out, “Oh, Massa Clinton! there come Miss — Yes, it's she looking out of the windy.” “Miss who?” called out Clinton. “Is it Mary?— Miss Carlton,”—and he sprang towards the gate. “Yes, it's Miss Mary, by goley—” “Peter—are you swearing?” asked Mr. Bradshaw, sternly. Pete slunk behind the carriage, which now drove up; and Mary Carlton was greeted by her old friends with a heart-felt welcome. “O!” said she, throwing herself into Mrs. Bradshaw's arms, “my more than mother—this, indeed, seems like home to me.” “Ugh! ugh!” coughed Mr. Chesterton—“as Jack Dryden says: “`Old as I am,—ugh! ugh!—for ladies' love unfit, The power of beauty I remember yet.' Ugh! ugh!—why don't you introduce me to the lady?” “I ought to know you, Mr. Chesterton,” said Mary, making a courtesy to him, and offering her hand, with a laughing eye—for she knew him from Emily's description. “I ought to know you, for I have heard—” “Of my character, hey? Who has been writing my character to you?” asked he, darting a quick glance around. “Emily,” said Mary, laughing. “Ugh! ugh!—then I know she gave me a good character,” said he, with a pleased smile,—“didn't she?” “Why, I can't say exactly, good: she represents you a gay Lothario—” “Mary! Mary!” exclaimed Emily. “As a gay Lothario,” continued Mary, without heeding the interruption, “who had been making many a wild foray against the hearts of the girls in our neighbourhood. She tells me Mr. Willoughby has learned to practise your winning ways exactly.” “Ha! ha!—ugh!—I understand you: you're an arch one. I shall like her, (said he, aside to Bradshaw.) I understand you; and have you no intentions at a foray yourself? You've been taking, by force of—ugh! ugh!—arms, the hearts of the Solomons of the nation, at Washington; and now you have come here, as Burns says of one of his lasses, `Like Alexander, to spread—ugh!—your conquests farther'—hey?” “I see that your sagacity,” said Mary, “penetrates my intentions, at once—so, away with all stratagem: therefore, I warn you, sir, to beware of your heart. I'll take it if I can; and I'll wear it, if I do, on my sleeve, or at my apron-string.” “You will, hey? and you'll give me a fair chance at yours?” “Certainly. But, Mr. Chesterton, you must fight fair; you have the advantage of me, as you are such an old campaigner.” “Ha! ha!—you've hit me—ugh!—old campaigner! Yes, I'm in the hospital of the invalids: I shall do battle no more.” “I take you,” said Mary, archly: “that's your art—you Kentuckians are used to bush-fighting; you know how to play 'possum, Mr. Chesterton.” “Hit me again!” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton; and then he observed, aside, to Bradshaw—“playing 'possum!—ugh!—do you understand?—alluding to my will, my hoax, my poor devil business. I like her, though—I like her. She'll keep life in me, boy: she has the beauty of a Houri, and the wit and grace of a Cleopatra. Why the—ugh! ugh! —devil don't you—ugh!—court her?” Beautifully the moon rose o'er the Purchase that night. The tree tops were tipped with the mellow light that lived along the landscape, glittering in the ripples of the Branch, like the dimple in the cheek of laughing childhood. The breath of the early spring flower scented the air. It was a night for the full flow of the affections, and, above all, for love. “Let us ramble,” exclaimed Bradshaw, to Mary Carlton. She took his arm; and, followed by Willoughby and Emily Bradshaw, they walked forth, under the glorious moon-lit sky. “Whither—ugh!—away, my fair foe?” asked Mr. Chesterton, who was conversing at the door with Mr. Bradshaw, “whither away?—have you made Clinton a prisoner to your power?” “No, sir, only an ally. You are too much for me without assistance, so—” “Ay, I understand it; you mean to take him into copartnership, as a-sleep—” Suspecting what was coming, Mary blushingly hurried Clinton on, observing: “It's a beautiful night.” “Beautiful; shall we wander by the Branch, Mary?” “Yes, to the old sycamore; it seems an age since I have seen it.” Occupied with their own hearts, and with each other, Willoughby and Emily followed them, though at a considerable distance. As the pair of lovers took the winding path through the orchard, and then along the Branch to the old sycamore, they seemed, indeed, the proper living beings of such a scene. Leaning on Willoughby's arm, Emily looked up into his face with an absorbed and full affection; while he, clasped her hand, that trembled like a prisoned bird, and gazed upon her like a star upon the wave that reflects deep within its depths the living light—and thus they walked in silence. The very happiest hour of love is such a silent one. Mary Carlton leaned on Bradshaw's arm; and, as she stepped along, would, for a moment, bow her head, flower like, and watch, apparently, her little fairy feet, or turn to her companion, as if she sought a repetition of what he said; yet she heard him distinctly—or she would turn her head away and smile archly, or look up at the full-orbed moon, or on the landscape—and, thus walking, they discoursed. 21* “Were you anxious to return, Mary?” asked Bradshaw. “Indeed I was, Clinton: what is more wearysome than your fashionable society, where you feel little or no interest in any one; and they feel not the least in you. If there is any thing worse than your mere fashion, it is the mixed set of place-men-patriots, (I'm qualified to use such words, I've heard nothing else,) office-hunters and holders, and the varieties of north, south, east, and west, that you meet in Washington; I”— “I see,” interrupted Bradshaw, “that the letter writers have been trying to do justice to your merits, as a belle, Mary; and that Mr. Wortley has acknowledged your power, which, according to the letter writer aforesaid, you mean to exercise in mercy.” “What letter writer?—What did he say?” “You did not see it, then;” and Bradshaw repeated the extract we have given. “Who could have written that?” asked Mary, in a mortified and angry tone. “I hope, Mary, there was no ground for it.” “Ground for it!—Clinton! Clinton! I thought you knew me better.” “And so I do, Mary; but it provoked me to see your name coupled with any one's in that way. Tell me, was Talbot very attentive to you at Washington?” Mary spoke not. “Will you not give me your confidence?” “Yes, I will. But,” asked she, laughing,— “when did your authority commence, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw?” “When, dearest Mary, may it commence?” “That depends upon your conduct, sir. But, why do you ask me such a question of Mr. Talbot?” “I have a particular reason?” “Am I not to have your confidence, too?” “I suspect Talbot wrote the letter.” “It was base in him if he did!” exclaimed Mary. “For, at Washington, he renewed a suit which he made some time ago. Heaven knows, I never gave him any encouragement; and, that he might no more importune me, I—I told him the state of my feelings. He affected surprise, and said, that he thought Mr. Wortley was his favoured rival. I, with indignation, taxed him home at once, and asked him if he had ever seen any thing in my manners to Mr. Wortley to justify such an opinion. After hemming and hawing, he confessed he had not; but, he said, it was evident what my father's wishes were with regard to Mr. Wortley. The new light that burst in upon me, when he spoke of my father, set me to thinking of Mr. Wortley's intentions, and of father's; and, with a provoked sense of the ridiculous—more than half mad with myself, and yet I did not know why I should be—I sat down and wrote that long rigmarole to Emily. My father spoke to me afterwards; said I treated Mr. Wortley coolly, and that he had invited him to spend the summer at the Park. I had made up my mind to speak plainly to him, and was on the eve of doing so, when, at the moment, some one called. This was just before I left Washington. My father never spoke to me on the subject again, and I had no opportunity of speaking to him; and, somehow or other—never having been much with him, and when I am, conversing little with him, even on common-place matters, never having given him my confidence, for he never sought it—I shrank from making an opportunity. I wish, indeed, now, that I had. But,” assuming a livelier tone, she said—“there, Mr. Inquisitor-General Bradshaw, you have had my whole history.—Do you wish to cross-question?” Bradshaw caught her hand to press it to his lips—she snatched it away, and said— “You're a pretty fellow, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, to pretend to such deep interest in your humble servant. You hold this interest in most of the sex, don't you? That gay, young, rich widow, Mrs. Douglas who knew you at the legislature, and afterwards visited Washington, made you quite the theme of her conversation. She more than once insinuated, in public, and would inform any one, in private, plainly, that the speaker of the eloquent canal speech, made more eloquent speeches even than that, and when, too, he had the inspiration of one listener, only; but, she would add, with a blush, and a smile, and a sigh, his eloquence does not always prevail.” “Ah! you became acquainted with the fair widow, did you? She attended the debates regularly, and has a claim, I believe, to the attentions of every young member, particularly on his first it open, and tumbled into the room. Within ten feet of him, near the tar barrel, stood old Scratch, with the light in his hand. Bradshaw rushed past him, and descended the steps, into the grocery. There were several persons around the stove, who evidently had been startled by the report of the pistol. Bradshaw looked round to see if there was any back way, through which he could pass out; for he reflected, without his false whiskers and hat, he might be known to some of them, as the one who had hurt Adams. He saw no way of passing out, but by the front door. As he rapidly advanced to do so, the fellow who had been conversing at the stove with Kentuck, asked—“Where's the other fellow? Who fired the pistol? Where's your whiskers and hat, my lark?” “Keep dark,” said Bradshaw; “I left them up stairs. There's watchmen hid away, about here, I believe.” “The devil! What will Adams do? Don't you smell something burning?” At this moment, old Scratch called out from above—“Knock him down—kill him! He's a spy.” The fellows immediately placed themselves in a threatening attitude: one brandished a formidable club, and others drew their knives. They stood directly between Bradshaw and the door, calling out— “Traitor, spy—we know you. Say your prayers!” “Make way, my brave boys,” said Bradshaw, nothing intimidated, drawing and cocking a pistol, as he spoke. “Make a clear passage. Put up your knives and clubs. The first man who attempts to use one, I'll shoot dead.” “Don't fear him,” exclaimed the fellow who had previously spoken: “his pistol's not loaded. Didn't you hear it go off, up stairs?” “Why don't old Scratch come down,” said another fellow, intimidated by Bradshaw's manner, “and help us, if he wants him caught?” “See, boys!” said Bradshaw, producing another pistol, and holding one in each hand,—“two pistols have not been fired: one must be loaded. Your blood be upon your own head! The first one that attempts to stop me is a gone case.” So speaking, he passed deliberately by them, while old Scratch came running down stairs, crying out, “Stop him!” They followed, but at a respectful distance, after Bradshaw, determined to dog him. He crossed over to the old building in which were the watch. He thought it best not to call them, as the fellows might then scamper off; and he wished them to be taken. They followed after him, giving, at intervals, a low whistle, which was answered from the upper part of the lane, where footsteps were heard advancing. All at once, the cry of “Fire! Fire!!” from a hundred tongues, burst forth in that fearful tone, that tells it is near: at the same moment, a blaze of light revealed, to Bradshaw, the forms and faces of the watchmen, among whom he stood. “We've found him,” said Bradshaw. “He's at old Scratch's.” He turned and beheld the old villain's house on “Yes, Miss Mary, I know that; but young Mr. Bradshaw come here to-day; I told him all was out; but he come in, thew right open the windy, and lay right down on the sofa there, and kept looking at your picture, (there was a picture of Mary opposite the sofa, by Jarvis,) and I forgot to shut it after he went away!” “What did he say, Sue?” “Nothing, miss, only he asked when you'd come home—if missus had a letter from you when—” “Where did he go?” “He rid away on horseback.” “Did he—did—he—say any thing about me, Sue?” “No, Miss; he just lay down on the sofa, looked at the picture, and asked me for a glass of water. I brung it—and then he forgot that I told him that missus had no letter from you—for he asked again —and then he went away. He gave me a half a dollar, and told me, when you come, I must come my own self round to his office and tell him.—Why were you going, Miss Mary?” “You say aunt won't be in—if Clin—I'm going out to old Mr. Bradshaw's farm, Sue; to the Purchase.” When a man truly loves, no matter how cold or worldly, or ambitious his nature, he is often betrayed by his passion into a boyish confession of her power in his every tone and look, which, though he knows well of, and tries to control, he cannot; which gives his manner a kind of silent shyness. Bradshaw was as unsusceptible of this sensation we speak of as any other man, but as Mary Carlton stood before him, so graceful, so beautiful, so accomplished,—having caught from the world all the adornment and elegance it could bestow, without altering, in the least, the naturalness of her character, or the gentleness and goodness of her heart, realizing all in her that his heart had panted for, in its young dream of love,—he felt, in the still moonlight, in this scene of his boyhood, with her by his side, a woman, who had roamed by his side a girl, and whom he had loved then, as now, from whom he had been longer parted than he ever had been before—he felt “What he could ne'er express, yet could not all conceal—” an overpowering sense of her loveliness and of his love. “My beautiful, my own Mary!” he exclaimed; “I knew not how much I loved you, till you were away.—Raphael's canvass never gave back more truly a lovely form than did my heart yours:—it lived, breathed, burned there. Ambition, worldliness, the strife of the thick crowd forsake me, in your presence, to-night. I feel now how Mark Antony lost the world for love—and yet he should not have lost it—she should have been to him, in the stormy strife for empire, a light to guide, a star of blessed destiny. When I feel the stir of ambition most, I feel strongest the necessity of your love. Where can man learn such holy, such disinterested counsel as from the lips of her who has linked her destiny with his? In a free country like ours, where popularity is every thing, where can he find one who will so much advance him, as one with your powers to please? Call this not selfishness; I say it because in every scene of life my spirit is wrapped up in thine.—Mine is not the holiday love that, like the bird, must seek the grove to tell its tale—that only lives where flowers bloom and fountains sparkle. No, Mary, no! if I obtain power in this great land, and men's applause, and influence, by your gentle aid must I win and use them. And, if I fail, as thousands have, stranded by an adverse tide, or without power—having miscalculated my strength —to `ride the waves of glory'—when, all baffled, I am driven back to the obscurity whence I emerged, to the Pilgrim's Purchase—will you not make the pilgrimage with me? Shall I not pillow upon a heart whose every throb will still be mine? Your voice will have no reproach for me; its every tone will be a lullaby of rest.—Yes, I would leave the strife of the world, as my pilgrim fathers left their father-land, and find in thee, my own Mary, a world of love beyond it all.” Bradshaw, as he spoke, held a not unwilling hand, and pressed a lip that chid not. “I know: every body says you can be what you please, Clinton. You do not know how many things the great men in Washington said of you—how many questions they asked of your character—if you were ambitious—what side you took in politics.” “Did they?” said Bradshaw, while a proud smile broke over his countenance, and his eye became lustrous as the bright evening-star to which he elevated his brow, and on which, in abstraction, for a moment, he fixed his gaze. Vol. II. 22 “Yes, Clinton, but shall I indeed be to you all you have said? Am I indeed so necessary to your happiness?” “My Mary, the praise which you have uttered from any other lips could not move me. Then you are unchanged, and you did think of me in the gay world!—bless you!” Beneath the aged sycamore the lovers plighted anew their faith, the moon had been shining on them much longer than they imagined, ere they arose to return to the house. Just as they entered the little gate to the palings that surrounded the dwelling, they overtook Willoughby and Emily, who, like themselves, were just returning: at this moment, the cheerful voice of our early acquaintance, Miss Penelope Perry, now Mrs. Selman, greeted them. “Oh, you romantic creatures!—here have I been these two hours, like Miss Patience on the monument, cold in the cold moonlight, waiting to see you; and you have been wandering, like a Jack-o'-lantern, down by the Branch. Only see what all this love ends in!—the person puffing that cigar, and sitting opposite to me, not beside me, is Mr. Henry Selman, who once”— “Penelope, my dear,” said Selman, in a low half-provoked, half coaxing tone, “don't, now, trifle so.” “Who once,” continued his lady, laughing, but without heeding the interruption, “gave unto your humble servant, ladies, a devotion which would shame the chivalry of your knights—and now behold him smoking the filthy weed in spite of my remonstrances against the pollution of his breath. I wish we two were twain again just for one moment.” “Yes, indeed, if you were Penelope,” interrupted Mary Carlton, “you would have that cigar extinguished quicker even than was Sir Walter Raleigh's when his servant, who had never seen him smoke, thought he was a case of self-combustion, and threw a pail of water on him. I've learnt a lesson.” “Is it possible, Mrs. Selman,” asked Bradshaw, “that my friend Hal has obtained such authority as to pronounce `no pipe, no Parr.”' “Oh yes, indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Selman; “it would seem so. I happened to read an article in some book or other, this very afternoon, while I was waiting for my lord and master to bring me out. It told an anecdote of Dr. Parr and a lady. The lady refused to let the Dr. smoke in her best room, on account of her curtains, as well as of herself—he remonstrated, but she was peremptory. He called her the best tobacco stopper in England. One of two things appears,—either that I have none of the powers of command of the lady, or Mr. Selman has none of the qualities of Dr. Parr.” “My dear,” exclaimed Selman, “you know very well I told you I wouldn't smoke if you had any objection.” “There, now, Mr. Selman, why did you not tell that before, sir;—I only wished our friends to see that I had not lost all my authority—I”— “Ah, my dear!” exclaimed Selman, in haste to be delivered of a pun—“now I smoke you.” “Clinton, my boy,” said Mr. Chesterton, who had been in the house, reading, but who, on hearing the voices had come to the door,” ugh—Dryden has a fable versified from old Chaucer to the point, pat—ugh—It kept me, my boy, from matrimony. A lusty—ugh—knight, it says, did a very naughty—ugh—thing in king Arthur's time, for which he was sentenced to death—ugh. At the queen's intercession, he was saved, provided he could find out `what women most—ugh—desire.' What a d—l of a trouble he had to find out—any body who sees the sex now a days—ugh—could tell him. At last an old hag told him—ugh—but the condition!—she told him true, nevertheless—ugh. Repeat the lines if you know them, I can't for coughing.” “If Selman has no objection,” said Bradshaw, laughing—“and if I remember them. Ah! you know the hag tells him, and he tells the queen— I had more than one proof of them to-night. —“My lady liege (said he) What all your sex desire is sovereignty! The wife affects her husband to command; All must be hers, both money, house, and land; The maids are mistresses, even in their name, And of their servants full dominion claim. This at the peril of my head, I say, A blunt plain truth,—the sex aspire to sway; You to rule all, while we, like slaves, obey.”' “Ugh—ugh—a fact—a very truth—ugh—I believe it kept me from matrimony. It seems you don't mind being governed, though, you democratic dog, you—” “The only sovereign we democrats democrats, is the lady of our choice. And you remember, Mr. Chesterton, the hag's condition was that the knight should grant whatever boon she should desire; and when his life was saved, she claimed his hand. She turned out to be a beautiful woman—and, Selman, will you excuse me? knowing your former fondness for a quotation, I have fallen into a trick of it, “`And their first love continued to the last.' I've no doubt you will verify it, Selman,” continued Bradshaw, bowing to Mrs. Selman. “I'm in a fair way to verify the sovereignty quotation,” said Selman. “Ugh—ugh—you'll all verify that, young gentlemen, I can tell you.” “It appears you will not be so controlled, Mr. Chesterton!” exclaimed Mary Carlton, laughing. “Not, unless you conquer, fair queen—I shall —ugh—hold out to the last. I shall resist your apron-strings until you have me bound fast with them, as a slave resists the chains of servitude.” “Oh, you barbarian! And when I've conquered, and I drag you forth, like a captive Goth, amidst the splendours of Rome, you will pout in barbaric dignity, I suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">22* CHAPTER XIII. In due course of time, Mr. Carlton returned to Oak Park, with Mr. Wortley as his guest. The worthy politicians had been gathering their forces with all possible care—rummaging in the remotest parts of the state, like an old wife in a sly corner, for some article she had packed away against the day she should want it. Many an old politician, who had been laid upon the shelf, and who deemed himself so entirely forgotten, as to have sundry suggestions from his wounded vanity, on the propriety of taking the other side, in order to remind his former friends of his existence, and his country of his patriotism, in some flaming resolutions that he contemplated introducing in the first county meeting that should be held, was speedily disabused of his erroneous impressions, and forthwith made firm, either by a letter, visit, or completary frank of “public documents,” long enough for a year's reading. Mr. Carlton, knowing his daughter was treated by the Bradshaws with parental care, gave himself no trouble on her account, during her childhood. He felt, indeed, that the inmates of the Purchase were better guardians for her than any he could appoint, or than he could be himself. As she grew up, by tacit consent, she visited her friends and relatives, the Holidays, and between her father and them, a cold courtesy was, at length, established. His professional business, his speculations in property, and in politics, left him not leisure, sometimes for months, to call and see his daughter. He was satisfied to know that she was well, and with his neighbours, whose solid, unworldly qualities he could not but respect, while he felt that to imitate them, was not the way to advance in the world; and, therefore, he was content to praise them. Full of schemes for the accumulation of wealth, and for political advancement, years glided away, and the flowers at the Purchase budded together unsevered by Mr. Carlton. As Mary grew up, her father oftener called to see her: he took great delight in her playfulness, vivacity, and wit, became proud of her, but there was no communion of the heart between them. When Mary was told that her father would be out at such a time to see her, she would say to Emily Bradshaw, with an arch smile, for she possessed a natural observation of character, and understood what would please her father, “Now, Emily, I must put off my puritanism, look my liveliest and prettiest, and put on my most fashionable dress; for if my father thought me the least puritanical in my notions, he would whisk me off to boarding-school.” Mr. Carlton, therefore, knew little of his daughter's feelings, even in her childhood, and as she grew older, if possible less, for she discovered how entirely he wished her to act a worldly part, and naturally shrunk from conversing with him, on schemes where she felt she must thwart him. He had her taught every accomplishment, and lavished jewelry, dress, and wealth upon her, believing it, judging from himself, the best way to win her affections, or rather to control them to his own bestowal, which he was determined to do, for his political advancement, as well as for her worldly advantage. Of the boy, Clinton Bradshaw, he had thought not at all—and when Clinton grew towards manhood, and his great talents became a topic of public notoriety and praise, Mr. Carlton had an early opportunity of finding him one whom he could not use, and who would probably one day cross his path, unless he advanced very rapidly; for one of Clinton's first speeches, was at a political meeting, got up by Mr. Carlton, for the purpose of producing a certain effect, by the passage of a set of resolutions which he had brought with him, cut and dry, for the occasion. Bradshaw took a stand against the resolutions, and offered an amendment to them, which, after a long debate between him and Mr. Carlton, was carried. Mr. Carlton felt himself under too many obligations to the Bradshaws to show any dislike towards Clinton; in fact, motives of policy were more than sufficient to restrain such an exhibition, were his dislike even deeply rooted, which it was not: and if Clinton had shown the least symptom of being subservient to him, they would have been very good friends, as the world goes. Bradshaw supported Mr. Carlton for congress, though latterly, he was dissatisfied with some of his votes; and was certain to differ with him on the presidential candidate, if Mr. Wortley was his choice. Mr. Wortley was a gentleman of talents, who had held several distinguished stations, and who was one of the thousand and one talked of candidates for the presidency. He was a native of the same state with Mr. Carlton and Clinton. It was thought his own state, as a matter of pride, would certainly support him, and in the multiplicity of candidates, it was believed by his friends, he would be able to carry the vote in several other states, as it was asserted, his popularity was fast increasing. Therefore, there was no knowing what would turn up, and consequently the knowing ones who were on the fence ready to take the strongest side, at the first break of the sun-shine on Mr. Wortley's prospects, turned their faces to him, whenever they could steal the time from others. Mr. Carlton and Mr. Wortley had long been friends, and the former had every reason to believe that in the success of the latter, he would hold one of the highest and most honourable offices in his gift—an expectancy, which he could not found on the anticipated success of any other candidate. Mr. Wortley, also, was a man of wealth, and these considerations were sufficient to impress the father with the deepest conviction of the advantage of such a match to his daughter. Occasionally, when he heard his daughter teazed about Bradshaw, a suspicion of her attachment would pass over his mind—but nothing in her manner would revive it; for, observing there was little or no cordiality between her lover and her father, she never spoke to her father of him, and he never mentioned Bradshaw to her, from two motives: First, it occurred to him, if his daughter was pleased with Bradshaw, it was but a girlish partiality, which would be soon forgotten in the bustle and adulation of fashionable society—when she was away from him, and heard not his name mentioned: Secondly, he could not in his conscience speak against Bradshaw: and, if he had reconciled his conscience to it, which he could have done upon a push, expediency would have told him, that as his daughter was devotedly attached to Clinton's family, and had every reason to be so, her generous feelings, would be aroused in his vindication, and the very effect might be produced, which he was endeavouring to avoid—for we at least never dislike those whom we vindicate, and we often learn to love them. Bradshaw's attachment to Mary Carlton had grown upon him unawares; and when he discovered its unconquerable strength, or rather when he discovered it was returned, he determined to win a reputation, and the means of supporting her in affluence; commensurate, somewhat, with her expectancy, before he asked her hand. To this his own pride, but more her father's manner towards him, moved him. The day after the arrival of Mr. Carlton and his guest, at Oak Park, Bradshaw rode out to make a formal visit to him; for there was a great show of courtesy between them, particularly on Mr. Carlton's part. But, somehow they kept, since the political meeting we spoke of, the “ice of ceremony” frozen to its hardest between them, which Bradshaw seemed not unwilling to break; for his manner was frank, unrestrained, and free, and, as if he were not the least aware that there were any passages in their intercourse disagreeable to Mr. Carlton; while the manner of that gentleman to him was that of pique, which he feared to vent, and could not entirely conceal. In fact, Bradshaw had the desire to be friendly with Mr. Carlton; but he would not, by look, or smile, or tone, compromise the independence of his conduct; or advance a hair's breadth more than he was met. He quickly perceived Mr. Carlton's manner had changed towards him since his amendment to his resolution; but he resolved to show him (Bradshaw was under the impression Mr. Carlton knew he was attached to Mary,) that while there was no change in himself, he had acted, and would act, perfectly independent—with uninfluenced and fearless purpose, in expressing his opinions, and in acting upon them. As Bradshaw gave his horse to a servant, he asked for Mr. Carlton, and was told that he, with Mr. Wortley, had taken a walk; the servant did not know where, but he believed to some of the neighbours. “Electioneering,” thought Bradshaw. “Where's Miss Mary?” he asked. “I believe Miss Mary's in the garden, sir.” Bradshaw entered the garden, and then the summer-house, and found Miss Carlton arranging a number of books which she had brought from the dwelling, on a table. “Mary, how blue you're getting!” he exclaimed. “Ah, Clinton! is it you? Walk in, am I not blue? yes, as blue, sir, as Mrs. —” “No, Mary; you are not as blue as Mrs. — Her blueness is that of skimmed milk—blue from thinness. Her stocking won't take the dye, though she dye it ever so often. But you're like the sky above you— “`Darkly, deeply, beautifully blue.”' “What, a quotation and a compliment again. I thought you had done with such things, when Penelope married.—” “No, there are some who always remind us of poetry and praise. What book is that open there?” “Moore's Life of Sheridan—one of your idols. And Moore says, sir, notwithstanding, Mr. Sheridan was an exception that—`Nature delights to put her costliest gems in the frailest vessels:' a very foolish thing on the part of Dame Nature, certainly; but the fact, if it be a fact, is, I suppose, abundantly satisfactory to the vanity, and quite a balm to the bodily condition of Mr. Clinton Bradshaw. Clinton, Sheridan was a very scurvy fellow. I shall detest the very mention of his name —how he neglected that lovely and devoted wife of his!—And yet I have no doubt he made as many soft speeches as some I know of, when he wooed her.” There was a strange coldness in her tone, which Bradshaw did not understand. “Doubtless, lady; for he knew how to make speeches. What a time he had of it to win her!” “Yes, and with what treachery he acted towards his most intimate friend and to his brother!” “Will not a lady forgive the treachery which is practised for love of her? He may tell her, with the poet, that `treachery was truth to thee.”' “If she does, she is sure to be punished for it, as Mrs. Sheridan was punished—`Treachery truth to thee,' that's fiction, Clinton—false foul fiction —Mrs. Sheridan found it out to her sorrow, indeed.” “Mary, what's the matter? Why, such a tone?” “Why, Mr. Talbot—no matter.” “Mr. Talbot—no matter;”—but it is matter, Mary; and matter of the deepest importance to me, if it gives sorrow to you.” “I meant to play the hypocrite and be `treacherous' when I met you, but,—Clinton, Clinton, is it true; can it be true, that you made a jest of me publickly in the court-house, and said I was to marry Mr. Wortley, called us January and May, and laughed at me?” “Ha! now I understand it—By heaven! Talbot and I will meet upon that narrow pass ere long, where one of us must leap the precipice,” muttered Bradshaw between his clenched teeth. “Clinton, Clinton Bradshaw, remember what the violence of your passions have done—do no injury.” “Mary, what said he?” asked Bradshaw, in a tone of assumed mildness. “What did Talbot say I said of you, Mary?” “That tone of calmness cannot deceive me, Clinton,” said Mary, alarmed at the danger in which a quarrel would involve her lover, and forgetting, in the alarm, every feeling else;—“I don't believe it—I meant not to tell it to you— you must promise me on your honour to say nothing about it.” “Will my honour allow me to make such a promise, Mary?” “It will—it will.” “Mary, listen to me:—Talbot has been poisoning your ear against me—It is proper, you know Vol. II. 23 it is proper, Mary, that I should know what he has said.” “It was said to no one but myself, Clinton;— let it pass.” “No, Mary, it must not pass. If you will not tell me, Talbot shall!” “What, will you go, Clinton Bradshaw, and represent me as a tale-bearer to you of what he says!” “Mary, you told me the last night—happy night —we spent at the Purchase, that you had, in Washington, when Talbot importuned you with his suit, told him of what had passed between us. He knew, then, that I loved you; that my love was not frowned upon—nay, let me not hunt for delicate phrases—was returned. Well, knowing this, (Bradshaw's frame trembled with rage,)—knowing this, he writes a letter that you are to marry another! Yes, by heaven! I believe he wrote that letter— a published letter: on the heel of it he returns and proclaims the truth of the report; and while it rings in my ears, in the jests and jeers and glad regrets of those around me, he listens to hear what I shall say—what I shall say, when pride, stung to madness by suspicions and unrequited passion, buries the barbed arrow in the heart, and smiles and jests with the desolation that withers it. Yes! he listens. Did I not know that he was listening? And think you that I would suffer him, if you had so fallen from your high promise, and wrecked my dearest hopes, to read it on my brow?— “`This mask before the babbling crew— This treachery was truth to thee,' No! lady—I may die a martyr to this love I bear you yet; but, like the Indian at the stake, no note of lamentation shall break from me, to gladden the heart of such as Talbot: it is not in my nature— but it is in his, and he shall answer for it.” And he started to go. “Clinton—do not leave me! O! do not leave me, in this ungovernable passion.” “Listen to me, Mary. After this letter was written—after Talbot confirmed the report—after the jests and jeers that echoed it, rung in my ears —at which, in the sin of my agony (for it was sinful, it seems, to feel on this occasion) I dared to say that such a union would be blooming May with hoary January,—after all this, I met you: did I taunt, did I reproach you—did I cast at you what Talbot uttered, and mistrust you upon his authority?” “O, Clinton! Clinton!” she exclaimed—“if I reproached when you did not, 'twas because I loved you the more.” Bradshaw caught her to his heart. “My noble, my frank, my beautiful love—forgive me. A conviction of how unworthy I am of you, suffered me not to read your feelings. Know you not that—” At this moment, Mr. Carlton, accompanied by Mr. Wortley and Talbot, (two of them, at least, astonished witnesses of the scene,) stood before the lovers. Talbot, if not so much astonished, was, at least, as much enraged—for the latter part of the conversation of the lovers had been overheard by the intruding party, who had opened the gate unheard, and whose footsteps had fallen noiselessly on the grassy walk of the garden. “Mary—Miss Carlton—what does this mean?” exclaimed Mr. Carlton, in astonishment and anger. “What does it mean, I say?” and he stamped upon the floor furiously. Mary sunk on a chair, which happened to be near her; and bowing her head, in confusion, covered her face with her left hand, while her right one unconsciously remained in Bradshaw's grasp; his unengaged hand was thrust into the bosom of his vest—a habit with him. Talbot's glance upon them was the concentration of envy and ill-will. “What does this mean, Miss Mary Carlton?” continued Mr. Carlton, more furiously. Mary spoke not; and, turning to Bradshaw, he asked—“What does this mean, sir, Mr. Bradshaw?” “It means what it seems, Mr. Carlton,” said Bradshaw, proudly—for he could not brook the tone in which he was addressed. “Sir!” exclaimed Mr. Carlton, “I see through you; I've been informed of your character,”—here he looked at Talbot, in a manner that told Bradshaw, though it was not meant where the information came from—“Sir, you're a villain!” “Mr. Carlton,” said Bradshaw, “you well know that your age, and the respect I bear your daughter, protect you, or you would not use such language.” Our readers, to understand the extent of Mr. Carlton's passion, must be informed, that when Mr. Wortley and Carlton left the house together, Mr. Wortley recounted to Carlton the contents of a host of letters he had received; giving him most flattering accounts of his prospects for the presidency: after which, and after saying, that in the event of his elevation to that high office, he should require, as he had often told him, his friendly aid; he delicately hinted, that it would be the greatest pride and pleasure of his life, if the tie between them could be made yet stronger. Now these worthies understood each other from the beginning; but there's an explicitness in words, in airy words, when they tell to hope her dream, that for a moment seems to place the reality, which, in fact, may be as far off as ever, in your grasp. Mr. Carlton delightedly caught at the hint; and father and son-in-law, that were to be, became entirely confidential with regard to their anticipated domestic relations. Mr. Carlton had no doubt, knew, in fact, that his daughter's affections were entirely unengaged. She might have had slight preference at one time, which all girls, just from school will, for a week or two, entertain; but latterly, this foolish romance (if she had ever entertained such) had given place to a proper view of things. Thus conversing, like the lovers, they “forgot all time,” until they were joined by Talbot, who had spent the previous night at the Park; and who, in a conversation on that evening with Mr. Wortley, in answer to that gentleman's inquiries concerning Bradshaw's talents and influence, for Mr. Wortley was electioneering, and was curious about one so much spoken of as Bradshaw, had not failed to let him know that Clinton was opposed to his pretensions; of which opposition, Talbot gave a most exaggerated account; professing himself, at the same time, the devoted friend of Mr. Wortley. He pronounced Bradshaw's talents more overrated than any man's he had ever known; and was satisfied, he said, that he was as high as he ever 23* would be. Mr. Carlton was by at the conversation; and Talbot afterwards spoke to him apart, but with a hope that he would not let it be known from whom it came, and told him that Bradshaw was as much opposed to him as to Mr. Wortley, and was, in fact, the chief promoter of a call for a public meeting, that was to be held in the city on the next evening; at which, it was rumoured, the propriety of a measure, which Mr. Carlton had warmly advocated in congress, was to be discussed. Talbot, seated in a large bow-window of the mansion, and hidden by the curtains, had overheard Bradshaw ask for Mary Carlton, and saw him enter the garden. He immediately seized his hat and hurried out in search of Mr. Carlton and Wortley; resolving, by hook or by crook, to lead them to the garden, and prevent the tête-à-tête of the lovers; for it not only awoke all his envy and jealousy, to know that they were together, but he dreaded an explanation between them of what Bradshaw had said in the court-house, when the report of Mary's marriage to Wortley was spoken of, which he had foully misrepresented to her. Let us return to the summer-house. The tone and manner of Bradshaw increased the rage of Mr. Carlton. “You deserve worse language than any I can use,” he exclaimed: “you have taken advantage of my daughter's being at your father's, and endeavoured basely to steal her affections—yes, sir, steal her affections!” “Father,” interrupted Mary Carlton, with dignity, “there was no stealing in the case—I freely gave my affections.” “Don't speak to me—if you disobey, you'll find yourself a beggar. Yes,” continued Mr. Carlton, addressing Bradshaw, “steal her affections! Why did you not speak to me, her father, as an honourable man would have done? No, sir, this is in keeping with the rest of your Jesuitical and vil—” “Mr. Carlton,” said Bradshaw, interrupting him, “spare your lungs, I pray you, sir; there is to be a public meeting to-night, when you may have to use them. Mr. Talbot, it will not be agreeable to Miss Carlton to have her name connected with mine in recounting, either in letter writing, or scandalous tattle, this scene. You act at your peril, sir.” “Clinton! Clinton!” exclaimed Mary, “remember your promise; do not—do not—” “Mary,” said Bradshaw, “your very slightest wish shall be my inviolable law. Mr. Wortley, I regret our acquaintance was not renewed under less turbulent auspices; we have not had leisure to exchange even the courtesies of a greeting. I bid you good morning, sir:” and Bradshaw lifted his hat, leisurely left the garden, mounted his horse, and rode to the city. Bradshaw sat in his office all the afternoon, brooding over what had occurred. There was more tenderness in his love for Mary Carlton than he had ever felt before; he had loved her for her bewitching vivacity, for her beauty, for her wit, for her mind—which was every day impressing him more and more with its superiority to the generality of her sex,—he had loved her with a proud love, connecting her with the dreams of his ambition; but now his heart gushed over towards her, and he thought not of these qualities—he thought of the pure and loving spirit that dwelt in her bright form. He long mused in a revery of love. Then the gentle emotions which she called up fled as he thought of her father; and as Talbot crossed his mind, an expression amounting to loathing passed over his countenance. Bradshaw had rather a taste than a talent for poetry, and he often sought to express his emotions in a hasty rhyme; seizing a pen he wrote as follows. (Talbot's Christian name was Andrew.) RECIPE FOR MAKING A TALBOT. Take just enough of law to lead astray, And just enough of politics to bray— Of virtue, just enough to talk about it, And just enough of faith, in faith to doubt it— Of spirit nothing, and of honour naught, And not one gleam of independent thought— No love of country, and no sense of shame, And no aspiring for a lofty name— Not art enough to make a lucky knave, Of fawning, quantum suff. to make a slave; With it enough of moral strength to say, An “ay” or “no,” as interest leads the way; Behind his back, with safety in the blow, Take all the courage that would strike a foe,— Courage that aims a bullet at his brain, And trembles so, that 'tis a fruitless aim— A serpent's smoothness, and a parrot's prate, And, when there's safety, floods of Billingsgate;— No incantation need you say or sing, Mix these ingredients, and you'll have the thing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. The political meeting for which Clinton Bradshaw advised Mr. Carlton to husband his strength, had been called by the party who were opposed to Mr. Carlton, together with some who were personally favourable to him, but who entirely disapproved of the course he had taken in regard to a particular measure. That measure we may not designate; for it is our purpose to meddle not, in these pages, at all in politics; and we allude to it because it is necessary in our history—though we name not its character, nor comment on its consequence; and we rejoice that we can progress just as well without doing either. Mr. Carlton's determination to spend the summer at home, was, no doubt, made with a view to his popularity. In the fall, the congressional election was to take place, and he intended being a candidate for re-election. Believing in the adage, “that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,” he resolved, if the people would re-elect him, still to hold his seat in congress, and afterwards to become a candidate before the legislature for the vacant seat in the U. S. Senate. Therefore, if he should be elected Senator, he could easily resign his seat in the House of Representatives; and, should he fail in his senatorial ambition, he would still be a representative. The tour which he had taken through the state with Mr. Wortley, was as Wortley's friend, to add that gentleman's strength to his own, in his senatorial aspirations; for it was thought, as we have said, that Mr. Wortley's native state, from motives of pride, if for no other reason, would support him in the presidential contest. As soon as Mr. Carlton reached home, the meeting to be held this night had been called. He had been taught to believe, by some of those sycophants who always gather round, at least, a rich politician, that the excitement was a mere bubble, that would dissolve in air—in empty words. Bradshaw, though generally in favour of Mr. Carlton's course, was opposed to that which he had taken on this particular occasion, of which we speak; but he had no part in getting up the meeting, though Talbot had asserted to Mr. Carlton that he was the arch mover of it. Resolutions declaratory of the opinions of the state legislature, of which our readers are aware Bradshaw was a member, passed that body after a warm debate, and chiefly by Bradshaw's exertions, in which the opposite course to that pursued by Mr. Carlton was recommended to Congress; but when this meeting was called, Bradshaw said he felt no inclination to take part in it, remarking—“I have no wish to attack Mr. Carlton; and when I am myself attacked, it will be time enough to speak upon the subject.” Therefore, Bradshaw was surprised to see, in an evening paper of this day—a paper devoted to the interests of Mr. Carlton—a severe attack upon himself, as the originator of the meeting, in which he was denounced as the covert foe of Mr. Carlton—a snake in the grass, who had not courage to show himself. “I understand it,” said Bradshaw to himself, as he paced up and down his office, just before the meeting convened; “Carlton thinks I'm a mere political popinjay that a breath of his can annihilate. The scene of this morning has determined him to crush me at once—ha!—but for that I might still have continued an humble member of the legislature—a member of the legislature, where young unfledged gentlemen of all sorts, sizes, and conditions do congregate—but I have other aspirations—and, if I had not, how dare I to take a course political contrary to the opinions of the Hon. Samuel Carlton?—Bah!—I do flatter myself that he is most egregiously deceived—may be the honourable gentleman will have hard work to hold his own— this popularity of mine, if I have any, has grown up in the dark, while he was away! on his dunghill!! Snake in the grass. Think of that, my Pilgrim fathers. What sought ye thus afar? to leave behind you a posterity who should shrink from expressing their free opinions—opinions they were bound to express! Have ye, whose course was as straight as an arrow, left a race whose path is as obliquitous as the serpent's. I did think to temper your blue-law spirit with a little worldly caution, if not heavenly charity—your stiff-necked notions with a little courtesy—and to accommodate myself in other things to the spirit of the times; but—the fact is,” said he, pausing, “I have little of the rock in me, and less of Plymouth rock than any other; for but for Mary—I fear, if the truth were told—I should have been at war with this great Goliah—in his own estimation, before. I'll have a sling at him to night for my honour, if not for my love—I'll wait and hear him. He would serve me as I've seen a big boy serve a little one— he puts a chip upon my head, and then dares me to dare him to knock it off. Well, I shall dare him—I know this question, I think, thoroughly—I have examined it over and over; I shall not be caught napping. Ay, the meeting is held in the square opposite Mrs. Holliday's—'twill be a large one—the probability is that he has brought Mary in with him. `Never strike a man,' says somebody, `unless you mean to knock him down.' He thinks, perchance, if I dare to appear there, he'll annihilate me on the spot, and show Mary what a lover and what a father she has!—well, so be it! if it must be so.” In this disjointed manner, Bradshaw soliloquized for some time,—till, at last, the hour of the meeting arrived. Just as Bradshaw left his office, he was hailed by Jekyl. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said he, “is that you?” “Ah, Jekyl, my friend, I know your voice, though I can't distinguish your person—what news?” “Step back into your office one moment; I want to say a word to you, Mr. Bradshaw.” “Walk in.” They entered the office. “I suppose you have seen the attack, or rather the attacks on you in the Evening Gazette.” “Oh yes.” “Well, I'll tell you who wrote them! you know there are two, one editorial, and the other a communication. The editorial was written by old Carlton himself, and the communication by my particular friend, Talbot. One of the hands of the Gazette was at my office not ten minutes ago. He says he has set up the manuscript, both of Carlton and Talbot, often, and that he knows their hands, and he's certain of it.” “Is it possible?” “Yes, fact—old Carlton miscalculates his own strength, and underrates yours—or he's been misled in some way. There'll be a louder call for you than Carlton thinks for—don't fail to come, I must hurry off.” So saying, away went Jekyl. Alone, Bradshaw pursued his way to the meeting. It was now some time after dark, and from the many persons before and behind him, all tending in his direction, he knew the meeting would be a very large one. Various comments were made by the crowd, to which Bradshaw was an unobserved, but not a careless listener. “We shall have good speaking,” said one; “Mr. Carlton is no slouch at it, and Bradshaw's no chicken if he is young—he's game to the back bone. He beats every thing I ever heard.” “I mistrust him,” said another, in reply; “folks say he wants to marry Carlton's daughter—he's against Carlton in this business—but he hangs back, as I have heard, on this account.” “Why, ain't he a-going to speak to-night?” “Some say he is, and some say he ain't; but I mistrust him. I've seen him with the daughter Vol. II. 24 once or twice, and I think there's something between them.” Here the speakers crossed the street, and passed out of the hearing of Bradshaw. “Can it be possible,” thought he, “that my attachment for Mary Carlton is thus talked of—a town talk? Can it be believed of me, that love of the daughter shuts my mouth after this fashion?” He was interrupted in his reflections, by hearing his name mentioned, in a squad of five or six, just before him. “Yes,” said one, “we must have Bradshaw out —let's get together, and call him with a vengeance.” “To be sure, we must have him out. He's a young man, like one of us, and he's no mean pride in him, that keeps him from knowing a poor man.” “Have him out! no, indeed,” said another—“I go for Carlton—did you see the paper?” Bradshaw found a great concourse of people at the place of meeting. It was held, as we have said, near Mrs. Holliday's mansion, which fronted on a public square, and opposite to which was a large hotel. From a first floor window, of the last-mentioned building, a temporary stand, or hustings, was erected, and a couple of engine lamps, borrowed from the engine company for the purpose, were so placed as to throw their light on the form and face of the speaker. The crowd stood in the street, and, such was the interest taken in the meeting, that it was computed there were from four to five thousand persons present. With some difficulty, Bradshaw elbowed his way through the crowd, who, however, made room for him, whenever, by the flare of the lamps, or by the voice, as he asked for passage, they recognised him. When he entered the room, from the window of which the stand was erected, he beheld Mr. Carlton, with a number of his friends around him, in lively political conversation. Mr. Carlton was stating to them his reason for the vote he had given, and they were listening with approving nods and smiles: among the most conspicuous in approbation was Talbot. As soon as Bradshaw's acquaintances in the room observed him, they gathered around him, and one of them said, “Bradshaw, Mr. Carlton intends, he says, to give it to you, for the part you took in passing those resolutions.” “Ah, does he? Well, I must summon fortitude to receive.” “Ugh—ugh—and courage to reply, I hope, my boy,” said Mr. Chesterton, who bustled up to Bradshaw's elbow, and slapped him on the shoulder. “I've—ugh—come in all the way to town to hear you—you sly dog—never spoke a word of this meeting, hey—steal a march on every body, would you? I heard it by the merest accident, that you were going to hold forth. D—n it, I would have been provoked with you, if I had missed—ugh—this—” “When did you get in, Mr. Chesterton?” “Ugh—not ten minutes since: called at your office for you—ugh. I heard all the great stump-speaking in Kentucky in my day—Pope, Clay, Barry, Joe Davies—all of them—ugh—we used to hold the meetings in—” Here the uproar of the crowd without, calling on the speakers to commence, drowned the voice of Mr. Chesterton; and Mr. Carlton pushed by Bradshaw, with an assumption of great dignity, and, assisted by Talbot, stepped on to the stand. There were considerable applause and clapping of hands, when he made his appearance, though not so much as he seemed to expect. Bradshaw's friends, in the room, called out to him to step out on the stand, and show himself; but he laughed, shook his head, and said, “I'll wait awhile, till I hear what's the play.” Mr. Carlton went into a long history of his political life, and dwelt upon all the leading public measures he had advocated, until he came down to the particular one under consideration. Upon that he expatiated at large, spoke of the resolutions of the legislature, and said, “That he was sorry so respectable a body of men should have been so misled by a set of designing demagogues; one of whom, at least, who, he was sorry, represented the same people with himself, might have waited the prompting of older and abler heads.” “Is Mr. Bradshaw present?” interrupted a voice from the crowd. “I am here, sir,” said Bradshaw, stepping out on the stand, where the light shone full upon him, and lifting his hat. “Hurra for Bradshaw!” shouted a thousand voices; to which there were as many dissenting hisses from the strong friends of Carlton, whom the speech of that gentleman, and the paragraphs in the paper had incensed against Bradshaw. Bradshaw stood erect, and looked round upon the crowd, while the hurras and hisses continued for more than a minute. At last, there was silence, when Bradshaw said, in a courteous, clear tone, that every one present heard, “I am here, my fellow-citizens, and ready to defend myself; which, with your leave, I will do, when your honourable representative in congress has concluded.” “Go on now, Bradshaw!” shouted a number, while others told him to be off, “you won't do,” &amp;c. He did not appear embarrassed, but, putting on his hat, stepped back, and leaned against the house, remarking, as he did so, “When Mr. Carlton's done, my friends, I will not detain you long.” Mr. Carlton now, thinking the sign strong in his favour, became much more personal and severe on Bradshaw, who stood by, looking on the crowd, from which he not unfrequently cast his eye to Mrs. Holliday's window opposite, where he was satisfied he saw Mary Carlton, for, every now and then, she would leave the window, at which the ladies sat, and walk across the room restlessly, and, whenever she did so, the light from the large lamp on the centre-table shone full upon her features. Bradshaw felt a stern indignation against Mr. Carlton, and, for the while, thought of Mary only as the witness of his reception from her father's friends. He, however, waited without showing any emotion, until Mr. Carlton concluded, and when that gentleman finished, there was a long and loud call for Bradshaw, from both sides, as all felt anxious to hear him. “Ugh!—ugh!”—coughed 24* Mr. Chesterton, who had taken a seat on the temporary railing, by the wall, near Bradshaw; “now, my boy, there's a chance for you. Pour it on to him—`scalding lava,' as old Parr said.” As soon as Bradshaw advanced to the place which Mr. Carlton had left, a deep silence reigned over the crowd. Men like these keen encounters of their fellows' wits—they look on with pretty much the same kind of feeling that inspired those of old, when they pressed to the gladiatorial arena, where he who showed the most skill, and made battle most bravely was sure to win the approbation of the multitude. There are, a wish to do justice, and an impulse to generosity, that run, like electricity, through a large crowd, when they are not controlled by a deep-rooted prejudice, or an absorbing, passionate purpose, that always will display themselves, when there is any thing to call them up. Without any premonitory flourish, and with great apparent calmness, Bradshaw said, in the first place, he had nothing to do with the call of the meeting, and stated why, in his legislative capacity, he had advocated the resolutions above mentioned. He did his duty, he said, and left Mr. Carlton to do his—nothing more was said, he continued, on the subject, until Mr. Carlton returned, and the call of a meeting by those who thought that gentleman had not acted with an eye to their political interests, was, Bradshaw thought, the very thing Carlton should have sought, if he was aware that there was any dissatisfaction with his course. But Carlton was not prepared to meet dissatisfaction, let alone censure, and he returns not only dissatisfied with, but highly censorious of, those who dared to act contrary to his notions. Here Bradshaw, with indignant rebuke, commented upon Carlton— and then, changing his tone suddenly, to one of ridicule, he apologized for Carlton's apparent self-sufficiency, and said he was to be excused, as he was fresh from Washington, where, as they all knew, he led among the magnets of the land—Heaven save the magnets!—and that, on his leaving Washington, he had taken a tour to superintend the political infant schools that had been established throughout the state, under his patronage. “He has been teaching the young political idea how to shoot, in the country,” said Bradshaw, “for he knows, that, “`Just as the twig is bent the tree inclines'— and when he returned, and found that our opinions wanted pruning, he set right to work; and, as I had been a member of the legislature, and had expressed some unpruned notions, when this meeting was called, he looked upon me as the naughty boy at school, who has been caught in one act of mischief, and is sure to have laid at his door, or, rather, on his back, every prank that is afterwards played. The fact is, he wanted to drive me into an act of rebellion—to compel me to take part in the barring out, so that, when he gets in, birch in hand, he may inflict upon me an awful punishment.” Here Bradshaw turned towards Mr. Carlton, to whom Talbot had handed a chair, and who had seated himself very conspicuously near the light, with the look and manner of a frightened urchin, who is begging off. His droll suiting of the action to the word, took every body by surprise, and caused an uproarious shout of laughter and applause; at which, Mr. Carlton jumped up in a passion, and, shaking his finger at Bradshaw, called him “a buffooning, boyish demagogue.” The threatening finger of Carlton, so like a pedagogue's, made the thing still more laughable; and the whole crowd took, in a moment, and laughed and shouted loud and long. Carlton, not at all perceiving the humour of the scene, turned to the people, and denounced Bradshaw with furious gesticulations; not one word of what he said was heard; and this, if possible, increased the uproar; for what is more ridiculous than a man bellowing and furiously gesticulating to a crowd, who hear not one word he says, for laughing at him? “No!” exclaimed Bradshaw, with great popular tact, when the uproar at length ceased, and Carlton had taken his seat, “no, my fellow-citizens, I am under no man's patronage or pupilage—I am one of the poor ones who go to the great free-school of liberty.” At this there was a stirring hurra for Bradshaw, mingled with groans and hisses. All, at length, were silent, except one, who, from the midst of the multitude, kept interrupting Bradshaw's efforts to resume, by an admirable imitation of the bleating of a sheep, which caused those around him involuntarily to laugh. “Turn him out,” exclaimed some: “Give that sheep some grass,” said others—still the bleating continued. “Turn that fellow out,” exclaimed many of the crowd, indignantly. “Don't interrupt him, I beg of you, my friends,” said Bradshaw, “he can't help it—he is the great belwether of our honourable representative's flock; and what you hear is instinct, not imitation.” The belwether's bleating ceased with the laugh that the remark occasioned, and Bradshaw, changing his tone, went on with great dignity; and with an eloquence that kept every man in the crowd an excited listener. He showed that he was right in the view he had taken of the measure under consideration; that, previously to his election he had advanced the same opinions he now held; that he was elected on these grounds; and that, therefore, he was bound to advocate them on the floor of the legislature; that he did so without being in the least influenced by Mr. Carlton's opinions. For,” said Bradshaw, “if I had been disposed to consider him as `Sir Oracle,' I should instantly have reflected that, like the oracles of old, he courted that ambiguity necessary to the success of the oracular craft, which might have left me a victim, where I expected to be a victor; for, however much there may be a doubt of our `Sir Oracle's' foretelling from what direction the popular breeze will blow, none will question the admirable facility with which, like the weathercock, he adapts himself to the breeze when blowing.” “Fact!” “fact!” “true!” “true bill!” shouted many of the crowd. “My fellow-citizens,” resumed Bradshaw, “in conclusion, I have but one remark to make.”— Here he took the Evening Gazette from his pocket, and read the articles it contained against him. The editorial article accused him of duplicity, of political tergiversation, of professing friendship to Mr. Carlton, and pretending to be his political friend, and of acting like a snake in the grass against him. “Of the communication,” said Bradshaw, referring to the article signed Junius, which, Jekyl said, a hand in the Gazette office told him, was written by Talbot,—“of the communication I now say nothing but this, that I know the dastard who wrote it, that he is now present, and that I tell him to his face and to his teeth, that he is a dastard and a coward;—but of this editorial article I wish to speak: I pronounce it untrue, in every respect—false in spirit and in letter; and I charge the honourable Samuel Carlton, our most honourable representative in Congress, with being the writer of it.” Mr. Carlton started up, and advanced forward, as if to address the people, when Talbot sprang to his side, drew him back, and whispered something in his ear, of which Bradshaw heard, “Tell them you consider it impertinence in Bradshaw, that you're not here to answer such charges.” “I must give up my......”—“No! no! on your honour, no!” interrupted Talbot—“We......”—Bradshaw heard no more. After a minute's whispering with Talbot, Mr. Carlton went forward, and said, after clearing his throat, “'Tis true, gentlemen, I did write that article—I sent it in town this morning—I did not request it to be put in editorially—I expect to prove every word in it—every word—you shall have my authority some other time—I must consult with the gentleman first.” Mr. Carlton stepped back—the crowd uttered not a word. Bradshaw at this instant, and for the first time since he had commenced his speech, in looking towards Mrs. Holliday's, thought of Mary Carlton, and the pain that all this must give her. He took the place that Mr. Carlton had left, and said— “My fellow-citizens, I deem it but an act of common justice to Mr. Carlton, to say that I believe he has been most foully and falsely deceived with regard to my personal as well as my political course towards him. I pronounce his authority a liar, and dare him to the issue—I am almost morally certain of the dastard; but he is no candidate for your favour, now; and when he is, I shall not shrink from meeting him at Philippi.” Bradshaw's friends gave three cheers for him, while those who cheered not made no demonstration of disapproval, and the meeting broke up. “Don't leave us, Bradshaw,” exclaimed a number of Clinton's political friends, who had gathered round him in the bar-room of the hotel. “Come, let us adjourn to a private room, and take something.” “Thank you, my dear fellows—but I must be off to — county, where the court sits the day after to-morrow.” “Ah!” said one, “you go to defend the kidnapper—old Lee—the rascal: don't you?” “Yes.” “I'm told you made him pony up to a pretty considerable tune; but, come, you can spend a half hour with us, nevertheless.” “Thank you: I cannot, indeed—'tis now eleven. At four, the stage calls for me, at my office; and I have a trunk full of books to pack up. Your country lawyer is keener than he of the city: he uses no library, and carries his law in his head. The juries in — county think a lawyer very profound, if they see him dog-earing a big book. For the more effect, I take a trunk full, and shall parade them, in regular files, as a militia-captain displays his band on a muster day, on the trial-table, before the jury. I take with me a parcel of new books, with the fairest covers on them, like a clear conscience. I have often thought that one of your old law books, that has been thumbed and soiled, with only here and there a white spot, was the very fac simile of the conscience of an old lawyer. Good night!” Bradshaw crossed the square, towards Mrs. Holliday's. The light was still burning in the front room, but the shutters were closed. He hesitated at the door. Was Mary still there? Was her father with her? Mrs. Holliday was away: could she be alone? He paused a moment before the door, and then deliberately ascended the steps, and rang the bell. In an instant, it was opened by Sue; and Bradshaw asked— “Is Miss Carlton in, Sue?” “No, sir—O! it's Mr. Bradshaw—yes, sir, Miss Mary's in, and so is Miss Emily. Missus was gone away, and I was keeping house.” “And an excellent housekeeper, I have no doubt, you are, Sue. What gentlemen are here?” “Mr. Kentucky, sir, and a strange gentleman, what coughs: he's gone to bed,” replied Sue, showing her ivory, with delight, at Bradshaw's compliment to her housekeeping. As Bradshaw entered the room, Mary Carlton started up from a table, at which she was writing, to meet him; and then, checking herself, said— “Come in, Clinton.” Bradshaw advanced, and, seizing her proffered hand, pressed it to his lips; and, gently encircling her waist, asked— “Do you forgive me, love, for all I have been compelled to say of your father, in my own defence?” “Clinton,” said she, blushing deeply, “don't you see Emily and Mr. Willoughby?” “`Behave yourselves before folks,' as the song says,” said Willoughby, laughing. Bradshaw turned, and, for the first time, observed him sitting on the sofa, in the back room, beside Emily. “Ah! Kentuck,” exclaimed Bradshaw, “you see I live in so much light here, from bright lamp, and brighter eye, that, dazzled as I am, I cannot, through the folding-doors, pierce the darkness. Miss Emily Bradshaw—my respects to you, sis: where's Mr. Chesterton?” “Just gone, most unpoetically, to bed.” “I did not know that you were in town. I saw Mr. Chesterton, but lost him, somehow or other.” “Bradshaw, I expect nothing yet, but that I shall be disinherited in your favour.” “If you think so,” said Bradshaw, laughing, “I'll make such an agreement with you as John Horne Vol. II. 25 made with the nephew of the individual whose name he took, and became John Horne Tooke. But where's Mr. Chesterton, we must not let him hear the agreement! The uncle was an odd fish,” said Bradshaw, lowering his voice, “often quarrelled with his nephew, and on one occasion, the misunderstanding went so far that the uncle told Horne if he would take his name, he would leave him his estate; Horne did so, but entered into an agreement with the nephew, as he was satisfied the uncle would soon quarrel with him; that, no matter to which of them the estate was left, they should go halves.” “Ah! I never saw that before.” “Didn't you? It's told in Tooke's life. The uncle left the estate to the nephew; the scamp promised Tooke a certain part of it, which he said, was all he wanted, and afterwards refused to give it to him. Tooke sued him and recovered it. So let Mary and Emily be the witnesses, and it's a bargain, if you say so.” “These ladies fair cannot well be witnesses, Bradshaw; for, I hope, before my uncle shuffles off this mortal coil, they will have changed their names, and ladies may not be witnesses for, or against their lords, saith the books.” “Lords! how that sounds,” exclaimed Mary Carlton. In a few moments Willoughby, in a low voice, sat conversing in the back room with Emily Bradshaw, and Clinton, taking a seat by Mary, asked her in as low a tone, what she was writing. “A note to you, Clinton, a note to you, charging you, if you had any regard for me, not to involve yourself in a duel with Talbot.” “Duel with Talbot!—My dear Mary, there is no fear of that: Talbot could not be kicked, cuffed, or horse-whipped into a fight.” “Then, will you promise me that you will not fight him?” “Mary! Mary!—no, love, I must not promise you that; but I will promise you, if he challenge me for any punishment I may inflict upon him, I will not meet him, unless you say—for you shall be judge—that my honour demands it. But don't talk of Talbot. With whom did you come to town?” “With my father, Mr. Wortley and Talbot in the same carriage—the most disagreeable ride I ever took or ever expect to take. O! Clinton, my father and I had such a scene after you left. He wished to compel me to marry Mr. Wortley, whether I would or no. I cannot tell you how stern and unkind he spoke. I became indignant: I told him plainly and openly of all that has passed between us. He threatened to disinherit me. He reviled me; but, no matter—'tis sinful I should feel anger against my parent. But, Clinton, why should he compel me?—I have never been with him any length of time in childhood, or since. When did he ever seem to take a parental affection in me? Often, for months, I have not seen him, and then it was a cold greeting.— And now, when I may be subservient to his ambition!—O! I never knew a mother's care—Yes! yes!—I have known a mother's care, and a father's care; but it was not at the Park. After years, when he has been to me almost a stranger, shall I —” “Mary, I would not let these things trouble me with a second thought. As for the disinheritance, love,” said Bradshaw, with a smile— “have you not heard the agreement which Kentuck and I are to make? I am rising rapidly into practice. If I were to quit politics, and devote myself to the law, and to making money, I have no doubt that in a few years I could acquire a large fortune. I —” “No, Clinton, money-making never will content you—never should content you—nor mere reputation as a lawyer. You can stand among the highest—why not the very highest?—in political power and public consideration. You do not know how ambitious I have learned to be at Washington. 'Tis not the wealthiest man, there, who is sought for, Clinton—followed, applauded, courted —nor the wife of the wealthiest, who draws round her the considerations of the great. You see, 'tis selfishness in me.” “Then, Mary, at once be mine, and teach me to be ambitious, and to aspire.” “Teach you to aspire!” “When will you be mine, love?” “I must see my aunt Holliday, Clinton—I must speak with her of my father—I must not act unadvisedly—I am strangely situated. My father brought me in this evening, and has not called for me—he has, I suspect, gone out without me. I must see aunt—I must consult aunt.” “Brother! Mary!” interrupted Emily Bradshaw, from the back room, “do you intend to talk there all night?—'Tis after twelve.” “It is!” exclaimed Mary Carlton. “Bless me, the neighbours will tell aunt, when she returns, that we have kept open house here, and had parties every night. Mrs. Grey, our near neighbour, has the School for Scandal enacted in her parlour every evening.” “Good night, sis,” said Bradshaw, to his sister. “I shall not see you for a week or more, as I told you I must be in — county the day after to-morrow.” “You defend a kidnapper, do you, Clinton?” asked Mary. “Yes, Mary,” whispered Bradshaw; “and if you would let me steal you, I think I could defend myself ably in any court in Christendom, particularly in the court of love.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">25* CHAPTER XV. A day or two after the public meeting, the proceedings of which we have very imperfectly given, while Bradshaw was attending court in — county, a meeting of those opposed to the re-election of Mr. Carlton was called. Jekyl was one of the prime movers of it. It was very numerously attended. Jekyl nominated Bradshaw as a candidate for congress, in opposition to Mr. Carlton, and Cavendish seconded the motion in a very able speech, in which, with cynical asperity, he ridiculed Carlton, and was truly eloquent in his praise of Bradshaw. The nomination was accepted with great unanimity. The friends of Carlton were very much incensed at the proceedings—they called counter-meetings, and passed violent resolutions against Bradshaw. The press, on Carlton's side, denounced him unsparingly, and threw out broad hints of charges against his private character, which, if Mr. Bradshaw insisted upon being a public man, should be substantiated and published. Jekyl had, in the increase of his patronage, been induced to enlarge his paper, and issue it tri-weekly instead of weekly, and he was doing very well with it. He hoisted the banner of Bradshaw, and the moment he did so, Carlton's friends dropped his paper. Such is the encouragement given to the freedom of the press! And not content with this, a squad of them had a meeting, and deputized two of their number to wait on, and inform him, that if he continued to support Bradshaw, they were determined to ruin his paper, and that, if he would take the side of Carlton, he should be greatly benefited. “Gentlemen,” said Jekyl to them, when they had delivered their message, rising with indignation from his chair, “I have always eaten the bread of honest independence, and I thank God! whether my paper rises or falls in this contest, while I have my health. I can still earn it. Mr. Farren, you are a man of wealth and influence—and I did not believe, until to-day, sir, what was said of you—that you were a sycophant, and a time-server. You, Mr. Lyle, are descended from a revolutionary worthy, sir. I am sorry to tell you what I do, that you are the degenerate son of a worthy sire. You would sell your birthright. Tell the gentlemen that they may do their worst. Mr. Bradshaw was my earliest and best friend: I believe him politically right. I won't give up the ship, sirs—the cause—the paper— while I have the means to circulate it. I shall give an account in my next paper of your message, gentlemen; and I shall publish your names, and the names of those who sent you. Now, there's the door—make a bee-line out, if you please, gentlemen, and never enter it again, unless you wish to feel the arm of one who has been an honest blacksmith, and who will be an honest blacksmith again, before he'll follow the tracks of either of you.” The day after the visit of the gentlemen, above mentioned, to Jekyl, eighty-three of his subscribers sent the peremptory order, “Stop my paper.” This did not abate Jekyl's zeal for Bradshaw, nor prevent him from publishing his interview with Farren and Lyle, with their names, and the names of those who sent them, in full. These gentlemen were highly incensed, and made a most furious attack on Jekyl, through the columns of the Gazette. In reply, he spared them not, and dealt as severely with Mr. Carlton. The day after this last publication, while Jekyl was sitting alone in his office, our reader's acquaintance, Mr. Chesterton entered. “This—ugh!—is Mr. Jekyl, editor of the Mechanic Advocate?” “Yes, sir.” “My name is Chesterton.” “Take a chair, Mr. Chesterton,” said Jekyl, offering him a chair. “Give me—ugh—your hand, my boy, I'm glad to know you—you've heard of me?” “Yes, sir, I've often heard your nephew, and Mr. Bradshaw speak of you.” “Ah! you've heard of—ugh—my poor devil business, as master Clinton called it—hey!—of my will—sir, I had fawning knaves—Dodridge and other sycophants, sir—ugh—ugh—who deceived me. After my nephew left me, sir, I had nobody but them and my slaves about me—slaves all. I don't like—ugh—democracy, sir, your democracy; but I honour an independent man, and I despise, from my soul, this cringing and fawning spirit— subscribers dropping off—hey?” “Yes, sir, and I'm gaining a few.” “Ugh—glad to hear it—that's good for Bradshaw. I like that boy; he suits me to a T, to a fraction—ugh—ugh—ugh—he'll thunder in the capital yet, hey! suppose you know my nephew,— Kentuck they call him,—is to marry his sister?” “Yes, sir, I've heard so.” “Well—ugh—of course—then I'm interested in the family.” “Yes, sir.” “Ugh—well then I'm interested—ugh—in you and in your paper—ugh. I don't do it for your d—d democracy—understand. I've no chick nor child; Willy 'll get all, except what I leave to Bradshaw. Ugh—ugh—may be my purse is as deep as some others we might name, ugh—ugh— ugh—so go a-head, my boy, and when you want any money, I'm your man. This is to be a tight contest; Bradshaw ought to be home; Carlton made a stump speech last night, and abused him like a pick-pocket. Good deal of—ugh—boisterous Billingsgate in him—hey!—can't you make your paper a daily, hey?—and meet that daily lie—that gazette, with a daily—ugh—contradiction and castigation. You must do it; I'm your man; any time you're ready, I'm your man. Ha, ha, so you ordered the rich, rascally, ragamuffins out, hey! we must beat 'em, we must beat 'em—ugh—what do you say of a daily, hey?” “I don't think, sir, that Carlton's friends can hurt me much more; they've stopped two hundred papers, though, already.” “Ugh—they have, hey? well, don't say any thing about it, but put me down for two hundred papers. I understand—don't do it to help a Jacobin, what I take you to be—ugh—but I like the boy, Bradshaw, and we must beat them.” “I had, since I came out for Bradshaw, sixty new subscribers, who came to the office unsolicited, and subscribed. When Bradshaw returns, if he determines to be a candidate”— “Determines to be—ugh—ugh—a candidate!— he must be a candidate; that's your—ugh—d—d democratic Jacobinical doctrine, `neither to seek nor decline;' ha! ha! ha!—ugh—ugh—preposterous; but Bradshaw must hold to it, and you must hold to him as the candidate, that's all—but I interrupted you.” “I was about remarking, sir, that if Bradshaw determines to be a candidate, and I think he will, I may safely say, I can make a daily of my paper with a little assistance. I could give a mortgage on the establishment; it is now free and unincumbered—I could make a daily of it and run the gazette hard.” “Ugh—ugh—it must be done. Some puppy— did you see it? some puppy of a correspondent has an article on a stranger's meddling in politics, and —ugh—ugh—takes me off. I'll cane him if I find— ugh—him out—takes me off; the anonymous knave, did you see it?” “Yes, sir, I saw an article in that paper yesterday, alluding to a stranger's interfering in our politics,” said Jekyl, with a smile, which he could not suppress; “but I was not aware he meant you, sir.” “You smile, hey!” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton. “Ugh—I understand: you're thinking of Pope, the poet, hey! and mad Dennis—Dennis, the critic— ugh—my thunder Dennis, hey?” Jekyl protested that he was not, and that he did not know to what Mr. Chesterton alluded. “Don't know to what I allude—ugh—ugh—my cough's bad to-day. Why, when Pope's Essay on Crit—ugh—icism was published, Dennis—Dennis and he were at daggers drawn—stepped into the booksellers—ugh—opened the poem, and read, “`Some have, at first, for wits, then poets passed, Turned critics next, and proved'—ugh—`plain fools, at last.' Ugh—ugh—ha—`By gad! he means me!' exclaimed Dennis—mad Dennis. Do you take now, my boy, my brave blacksmith?” “Yes, sir,” said Jekyl, laughing heartily at Mr. Carlton's oddness; “I take.” “Ha! ha! it's good, ain't it? I tell you, my brave blacksmith, General Morgan, of our revolution, was a blacksmith: did you know it? We must have a caricature—ugh—ugh. I bedeviled a fellow nearly to death once, with one of them— ugh—you remember when Bradshaw made the people laugh so, when he talked—ugh—about the barring out, and put on the look of an urchin—ha! ha!—ugh—the fellow'd make a good actor, first rate. Well—ugh—we must have a caricature, and have him barring old Carlton out of Congress —ugh. Scene, Congress Hall—ugh—doors and windows all shut, Carlton, with a switch in hand, mounted on the backs of—ugh—what's their names?” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton, snapping his fingers with impatience. “Ah, I have the rogues; mounted on the back of Farren and Lyle, trying to get in the window—ugh—ugh—ha! ha! Bradshaw has the window a little way open, and is knocking him on the head with a bundle of papers, some inscribed with the name of the measure Carlton has been advocating, and some Mechanics' Advocate. Hey! what do you think of it?” continued Mr. Chesterton, who had been walking up and down the office, every now and then, stopping before Jekyl. “What do you think of it?” he asked, stopping short. “Yes; and there must be a bundle of Gazettes sticking out of Carlton's pockets, and a fellow behind him, who is trying to get one of them, catches him—ugh—ugh—by the coat tail, and, ha! ha! that prevents him from getting at Bradshaw—ugh—ugh—there's a notion for you, my brave Morgan blacksmith.” Jekyl, who never restrained his impulses, threw himself back in his chair, and gave way to a hearty laugh, which Mr. Chesterton attributed entirely to his caricature, and was pleased accordingly.” “Ha! ha!—ugh—a good notion, you think, hey! who draws? who draws? I've a thousand things here,” tapping his head with his finger; “yes, a million, if I could only get them written down.” Jekyl was delighted with the idea of ridiculing Carlton, and told Mr. Chesterton that a young friend of his, an engraver, who had a great turn for such things, would be glad to get the job, and would execute it admirably. “That's the thing—the very—ugh—thing!” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton, “let him meet me here this evening if—ugh—you say so. And set about your daily arrangements, by that time too, folks like your paper—ugh—I know it will go with a little—ugh— pushing. We'll wax the rascals!” So saying, Mr. Chesterton departed, stopping, however, at the foot of the steps, and calling up, “Mind—my brave Morgan, not antimasonry—blacksmith, don't forget this evening.” The day, Bradshaw returned to the city, the following article appeared in the Gazette:— “LEE, THE KIDNAPPER. “We have just learned that this notorious character has made his escape from — county jail, under the following extraordinary circumstances:— Clinton Bradshaw, Esq., whom a certain set here, headed by a quondam blacksmith, now the editor of the Mechanics' Advocate, would elevate into a congressman, was sent for by Lee to defend him. In times of such political importance to the aspirations of Mr. Bradshaw, it is to be presumed he, Bradshaw, would not leave here without a considerable “consideration.” And we were, therefore, not surprised to hear that Lee, who is a counterfeiter as well as a kidnapper; gave him the enormous sum of five thousand dollars!!! to defend him. We may expect ere long to have counterfeit money circulating in our city particularly in the payment of election bills—it is but justice to say of the leading Vol. II. 26 members of our bar that they refused to defend Lee for any sum. But to our purpose—Mr. Bradshaw, on his arrival at — county, went to the jail to see Lee. The jailer showed him to the room, where Lee was confined with other prisoners, but so dainty are the olfactory nerves of this aspirant to congress, whose general company in this city would not warrant such an opinion, that he refused to speak with his client in the common room, saying that the smell was too offensive—think of that, Mr. Editor Jekyl—that the smell was too offensive, and beside he wished to see Lee in private. The jailer, who is an unsuspecting man, took Lee out of the common room, and suffered Bradshaw to be alone with him, in a room which he—the jailer—is in the habit of occupying as a kind of office, wherein he keeps the irons not in use, the keys, &amp;c. The jail is on the outskirts of the village, as county jails generally are; and in the room into which Bradshaw and Lee were introduced by the jailer, and left together, there is a window that looks out on a common, at the foot of which is a thick wood, full of undergrowth, that terminates in an almost impenetrable swamp. The jailer went about his usual avocations, not presuming to lock Bradshaw up with Lee, and expecting he should have notice from Bradshaw, of his intention to depart. But no such thing, Bradshaw left without saying a word to the jailer, merely telling his wife that she had better look after Lee—Lo! when the jailer went `to look after Lee,' the window above mentioned, was found open, a window that at least requires the strength of two men to open it, and Lee is not a strong man, and the bird had flown. “We leave the reader to his own conclusion. We have a host of facts, with regard to the morals and character of this youthful aspirant, that shall be forthcoming, if he still insist upon thrusting himself before the public, in opposition to one of our most talented and worthiest citizens. “We warn Mr. Bradshaw, in time, of the exposures, which his friends seem determined to force upon him. When a man is content to remain in a private station, the press should have nothing to do with his character; but when he insists upon being a public man, then should his misdeeds be made public, in justice to the people whose support he seeks.” The moment that Bradshaw saw the paragraph, he walked to Glassman's office with the paper in his hand, and read it to him. “What do you think of that, Glassman?” “I've seen it,” replied Glassman; “but I wished to see with what kind of a countenance you would read it—you'll do for a politician, my friend; and that's what cannot be said to every man possessed of political talent. Now, if you had raved and swore, I should have advised you to quit politics. What are your intentions?” “This paper, you know, is controlled by Carlton. Well! I'll run him a race, blow high or blow low—on that I am resolved. And I'll make Janson, this rascally editor, contradict every —” “You must leave Janson to me—I understand him exactly; and, as I stuck him once for heavy damages, in a libel suit, for a client of mine, when he had laughed, and told me I could not obtain a six-penny verdict, I think I can manage him. What is the foundation of this?” “The foundation is, that Lee bribed the jailer to suffer him to escape, and it was agreed between them that when I went to see Lee, and just after I had left him in the room to which he was always brought, he was to pretend to knock down the jailer and make his escape, which he did. The jailer's wife, not knowing their agreement, manfully resisted Lee's escape, in the passage, where she chanced to meet him, and he knocked her down. The jailer over-reached himself; for, not knowing what had happened to his wife, he hoisted the window that opened on the common, and then rushed out the door, and raised a hue and cry—told the people that Lee had knocked him down, and escaped through the window; and away he went, with a number of them, towards the woods. Others, more anxious to see how Lee got out, than where he went, hurried to the jail to gaze on the open window, when, lo! the jailer's wife told how Lee had knocked her down, and escaped through the back passage; and she showed her wounds. This discrepancy in the account of the jailer and his wife, raised suspicion: the jailer's apartments were searched, and three hundred dollars, in bills, some of which were identified by Lee's fellow prisoners, as having been in his possession, were found there. The jailer was arrested, and confessed the fact.” “Truly, Janson has a lively imagination!” exclaimed Glassman, laughing. “He would have made a good novelist or poet. It is recorded of Sheridan, your favourite, (old Sherry, as they used to nickname him, for good reasons,) that he one day asked his wife, if, since they had been married, she had ever kissed any man but himself? `No, my dear—but why do you ask?' `Well, have you ever wished to kiss another?' `No, not even wished; but, tell me, why do you ask?' `Egad! my dear, I'm up for parliament; and, if you have, they'll find it out and print it.' This is the age of inventions, you know. Some one said—who was it?—that a certain parson's preaching was a forty-horse-power preaching—he preached so well. Janson, there is no doubt, has a forty-horse power of lying—for, to my certain knowledge, the rascal, if you will suffer me to make a wretched pun, steams it with a vengeance. But, Bradshaw, my friend, this is a good omen—this abuse. It is a proof they fear you much; and would, therefore, put you down by any means, fair or foul. If the election came on to-morrow, Carlton would undoubtedly beat you; but you will gain on him every day. You should draw him to the stump as often as possible. He prides himself on being a veteran on the stump—and so he is; but you must serve him as Napoleon served the veteran Wurmser: take more prisoners from him than you have soldiers, till, at last, he himself has to capitulate. Men are often weakest when they think themselves strongest. He holds himself to be a marvellous man on the stump.” “I think he is a good stump speaker,” said Bradshaw. “Yes, so he is, in some respects; but he wants tact. The thing is, not so much to make in itself 26* a great speech, but a speech that is great to your audience. Burke, in his splendidly drawn character of Townsend, says of him, that he had the power of `hitting the house between wind and water.' He might have made a better speech, and shot over their heads. You don't want the reputation so much, do you? of making great speeches as of gaining great ends—speaking is the means.” On inquiring for Mary Carlton, Bradshaw found that she had left town, and had gone to Mrs. Holliday, who, as our readers are aware, had made a visit to the country. The lovers, when they last parted, had promised to write to each other, and Bradshaw had written to Mary, but had received no answer. In the mean time, weeks wore away, and the political contest between Carlton and Bradshaw was growing warmer and warmer: Jekyl had attacked Mr. Carlton with so much severity for some of his land speculations, that Carlton had thought proper to institute suit against him for slander; and was determined, it was said, to prosecute him to the utmost rigour of the law. The caricature made its appearance under the auspices of Mr. Chesterton, and, owing to the excitement, it took excellently well, much to his delight. It presented admirable likenesses of the opponents, though Bradshaw was represented as a smooth-faced urchin with the collar of his shirt turned over his jacket, and the head of Carlton projected at a “pro-di-gi-ous” length from the body and shoulders of Dominie Sampson. It was a great annoyance to Mr. Carlton; for, go where he would, his resemblance, as if distorted by a wizard, stared him in the face. Every moment of Bradshaw's time was occupied. His professional business had accumulated so rapidly upon him since the adjournment of the legislature, that he found either that he must neglect his business or take a partner. Willoughby appeared to have given up the idea of practising since the arrival of his uncle. Indeed, he had become so devoted a lover, that Bradshaw never thought of speaking to him of their contemplated partnership, except jokingly;—and then Kentuck would laugh and say that Emily would not let him practise law, as she had determined to be a farmer's wife. Bradshaw, therefore, made a proposition to Cavendish to become his partner. “Confound you,” Bradshaw, said the Judge, in reply, “I expected you to do this before: agreed; but our partnership shall only last till the congressional election, unless you beat Carlton; for, if you don't, I'll curse and quit you. And, mark you, Bradshaw, don't let any hankering you may have after Mary Carlton—the women have ruined many a man's fairest prospects—I've d—n little opinion of them—prevent you from dealing with Carlton as he ought to be dealt with.” “Why, Judge, have I not dealt pretty plainly with him?” “Yes; you have so far done as you ought; you and he will soon have to stump it through town and county—and you must not let any woman's flummery and stuff interfere with—to make a long story short—you must meet Carlton just as if he never had a daughter; now mind that, and I'll keep close here to our office. Your smooth tongue and stump speeches must catch the birds, and get their votes; then send them to me for lawing, as they call it, and I'll fleece the fees out of them. I go in for making money. By-the-by, Bradshaw, if you should want a little in your electioneering, I can contrive to lend you. Don't you, Bradshaw, trouble yourself the least about our business; don't think on the law till after the election—I can attend to it.” Not the least efficient of Bradshaw's partisans, were Nancy, the apple-woman, and Job, the jailer. They proclaimed his merits in all places and in all companies. “Yes,” said Nancy, one morning in the market-place, with a host of the market folks around her; butchers, country people, and their customers —with almost every one of whom she was acquainted individually, “Bradshaw will run mightily; and I tell ye he ought to run. I've knowed him 'afore he first commenced to read law, when he lived at his father's—one of the most respectableist of our honest farmers—I often buy fruit from him,—in the county round. It was going out to get fruit that I used to see the boy—a smart boy he was in head-work then, but sickly; and Mr. Gowler, our parson, tells me—an he's a feeble man himself—that the smartest folks is often ailing; it's natural to them. But who can speak, for all that, like Bradshaw; and he always has a kind word for every body—poor or rich, it's all the same to him, ye may swear. I've been, this twenty years gone by, tending in yer old court, and yer new court; and I've hearn the best o' yer pleaders.— I've a right to be a judge in lawing matters, as Judge Price says. Well, I declare to ye all, that in all my born days, I never heard such a speech as he made agin Johnson, the watchman, when he wanted to lay his own murder at a poor young creature's door.” “Yes, but Nancy,” said one of the by-standers, a Carlton man, “they say the gal give him a fee in that case?” “That's no fact,” said Nancy; “the poor thing had no fee?” “I don't mean exactly that,” said the fellow, winking at the by-standers; “you women have a way of engaging young men in your cause.” “That's a foul-mouth inspersion, Jim Bunks,” exclaimed Nancy, highly nettled; “it's a foul-mouth inspersion, and an unchristian slander, to make such an insinivation agin any woman. The girl's as good as airy lady in the land. Ain't we all sinners?—answer me that—a sinful, fallen, misled race. I know the first man was misled by a woman; but if yer casting that up, yer throwing dirt on yer own mother, Jim Bunks, and yer sisters; and it's no use in some families to talk of the univarsal sins of the world; they're enough to do to mind their speciality pleas, as the lawyers say.” Jim was hushed up, for certain family reasons, not necessary to mention. “No,” said Nancy, addressing the by-standers: “I can tell ye a nannacdote of myself, that shows Bradshaw to ye. Ye see, Josey Mulvany, afore Josey an' I was married, had laid up one thousand and ten dollars, with hard labour, I tell ye, to keep his old age; and, being unsure of the savings bank, he puts his money in Judge Harper's hands. The judge took the benefit—that was afore we were married, jist the very day, though. Poor Josey was a comfortless and sad man, ye may swear, and tell no lie. We thought the money, hard yearnings, was clean gone. Every body said it was gone; but Bradshaw he said nothing—but he looked round, and through the business; and he talked to this creditor, and that, and to the judge; and he worked it so, that Josey got every cent of it. He wouldn't take no fee, nor nothing for his sarvice. And when I went to him, to say that I and Josey was thankful, he jist took me by the hand—Bradshaw's none of yer high-notioned folks, what think themselves above poor people—he jist took me by the hand, and said, `Don't say a word on it, Nancy; ye'd do as much for me, any day, I know,' and so speaking, he jist took an apple, and wouldn't hear another word about it. What think ye all of that, I ask ye? If Josey and I had told our troubles to yer Mr. Carlton, would he ha' done it? But I don't want to say a word agin Carlton, for he's a sweet daughter; and I had the notion—but I ask ye all if such a man as Bradshaw ain't the man for Congress?” “You may well say that, Mrs. Mulvany,” exclaimed Job, the jailer, who had been a listener to Nancy's harangue; “you may well say that, if I know any thing on human natur. There's not one scrumption of arusticrusty in Squire Bradshaw, not one scrumption. He's as much of an American, democratic, revolutionary, Jeffersonian republican,” continued Job, waving his hand oratorically, “as much, I say, of an American, revolutionary, democratic, Jeffersonian republican, with as little arusticrusty in him as any man that ever went to the continental congress, saving and excepting, always, as the lawyers say, more or less, Genral Washington. As for his law, I always said it, since the first day we shook hands, that he would take the rag off of the bush at this bar—clean off: and Mrs. Mulvany and me has a right to know who's best among our lawyers—that every man on you, friend or foe, must give into. When he comes over to the jail to see a client, he don't strut and swell, and gape round, like some of your foppy lawyers, and treat me, the 'sponsible person there, as if I was nobody. No! him and I has long talks, and he often stops and takes a dish of tea with my wife and Lucy.” “And a fine cup of tea it is!” interrupted Nancy. “Yes, Mrs. Mulvany, you may say so,” said Job, “and so says Squire Bradshaw. I tell you, the very night that Adams—you've all heard of him— he's the fellow that robbed old Jemmy Swartz, many years ago, and played the devil ever since— the night he got himself hung atwixt the bars of the window, Squire Bradshaw took tea with my wife, Lucy, and me. And him and me went together to the rascal's cell, and saw him hanging right by the chin like, and his limbs were just quivering the death quiver. In that very case of Johnson, the watchman, who killed Isriel Carpenter, though Bradshaw did get him hung, that was owing partly to me, for I knowed the human natur of that Scrags, and found him out. The Squire was, at first, in a little of a flurry, in that case— but we managed it. In that very case, the Squire raised a pretty considerable of a sum for the orphans, widows, and daughters. We managed—” “Job, if you can manage so well at the law,” interrupted one of the by-standers, jerringly, “why don't you turn in and practise it?” “And why not?” asked Job, disdainfully. “You'll have to, I reckon,” replied the interrupter, “if you go on, at this rate, talking politics.” “Have to!—Why?” “You'll get turned out of the jail for busying yourself so much in political matters.” “Not afore you're turned in, an' I've turned the key on you, you rapscallion. I'm a free man, an' I'll explain an' expound an' expand my free 'pinions publicly, wherever I please. This is a free country, ain't it?” The crowd spoke their approbation of Job's sentiments, loudly; and, with their approval ringing in his ears, he walked on in his lordliest fashion, with his huge fists thrust into the pockets of his great jacket, so as to bring them almost together, and his market-basket resting on his arm, remarking, as he went—“I'm a free man, and I go for Squire Bradshaw.” “So do I!” and “So do I!” said two of the crowd. “And so don't I!” said another. “That's the very way it 'll go,” said Job, looking over his shoulder: “two to one—that's enough, I reckon;” and, after taking a step or two, he remarked, to himself,—“there's a good deal of human nater in man.” Mr. Chesterton, who had been in town for the last day or two, had come to the market-place in search of old Pete, as he wanted to send some message or other to the Purchase, and was a witness to the electioneering talents of Nancy and Job. As Nancy was following in the wake of the departing Job, Mr. Chesterton said to her, at the same time offering her a dollar, “My goddess Pomona—ugh!—I'm glad to see you here.” Nancy, hearing herself called a goddess before such a crowd, and by such a queer-looking man as Mr. Chesterton, whom she had never seen but once before, and who then addressed her in a very different style, feeling herself scandalized, exclaimed— “Man!—what do ye mean? Yer mistaken in the person—I'm none of yer goddesses—I'm no miss of yers—I'm an honest woman!” “Ugh!—ha! ha!” laughed Mr. Chesterton, outright. “She takes me for another Vertumnus!— and in the market-house to imitate that unruly god!—Ugh!—ha! ha!—He transformed himself to an old woman, while I imitate Jove himself, and come in the Danæan shower! and for such fruit!” “The man's clean cracked!” exclaimed Nancy, who remembered Mr. Chesterton's manner and Vol. II. 27 remarks, when she sold him some apples, as our readers remember, in Bradshaw's office, which she then thought very strange. “The man's clean cracked! demented outright! Who knows him?” asked she, of the crowd, who appeared to be inclined to adopt her opinions with regard to his mental operations. “Ugh!—ha! ha!—My goddess, don't you know me?” “No, man! I don't know you.” “What!—ugh! ugh!—don't you remember we had a little comfortable—ugh! ugh!—chat, all alone in Bradshaw's office?” “Man!” exclaimed Nancy, enraged, forgetting for the moment her impression that Mr. Chesterton was crazy,—“Man, do ye mean to disperse my character in the public market-place! What do ye mean by yer conductions?” “Ugh!—my dear, good apple lady, you misunderstand me—ab ovo—ugh!—Pomona was the goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus was a god in heathen mythology; just as Mo—ugh!—as Momus —” “The Lord deliver me!” exclaimed Nancy, forcing her way through the crowd. “Let me pass! let me pass! he's one of yer Mormonite preachers—a heathen from the far away wild west—he's fresh from the evil one with his gold and silver to tempt the followers of the Lord;” and she darted through the crowd in real fright, for she was very superstitious. The people gathered round Mr. Chesterton, gaping and wondering at him, while he, chuckling to himself at Nancy, looked about for Pete, unconscious of the crowd: at last he asked them— “My friends—ugh!—do you know Peter, who be —” “Ah! he's at it,” exclaimed Nancy, who had not yet passed out of hearing—“he's berating the blessed Peter, and next Paul 'll catch it, and the whole of the Heavenly apostles—the Mormon heathen—that I should have discoursed with him, and taken his money! I remember now, he only took a fip's worth, and got no change for his quarter. I must go an' see Mr. Gowler. We're sorely beset, sorely beset in this world!” Here, some of the people half in jest, half in earnest, called on Mr. Chesterton for a sermon. Now, at once perceiving their impression, he hastened away, followed, though, by a considerable number, who thought he was seeking a proper stand for holding forth; nor did he get rid of them till he entered a hack and ordered the man to drive away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. With all his energies, Bradshaw devoted himself to electioneering. In the neighbourhood of the Purchase, he completely stole a march on Mr. Carlton, as he, before that wily gentleman was aware, had visited all the old farmers, who knew him when a boy, and their sons, with whom he had grown up to manhood, and interested them in his success. He knew he had to contend against the united influence of wealth, and long established, and extensive political connexions. If Bradshaw had been consulted himself, on the propriety of his being a candidate in opposition to Mr. Carlton, he would have refused, in all probability. But when he found, that a very large meeting had voluntarily nominated him in his absence, and that the friends of Carlton, in public and in private, by speech and by the press, were leaving no stones unturned, not even the dirtiest, to injure his character, personal and political, he determined, come what might, to be a candidate. Having made this determination, he knew well, that to place himself on the course, with any chance of success, it was necessary his exertions should be untiring. Therefore, long before the usual time for calling the meetings, at which the candidates addressed the voters from the stump, Bradshaw again and again visited his political friends in town and country. He frankly told them why he was so anxious; that he felt it a personal as well as political matter. But he made no noise in his operations: apparently, he was leisurely strolling through town with little to occupy him; gallanting a lady, may be, when observed on the main streets, and, when seen in obscure places, appearing to have no particular purpose—with a group at a corner— he paused but a moment, like a passer-by, who has been caught by a casual remark, or who stops to make one. As usual, he went on Sundays to the country church, but there was nothing of the electioneerer in his manners; they were unchanged. His courtesy obtained no increase, and he did not appear more anxious than formerly, to recognise an old acquaintance, or to form new ones. Bradshaw had a quality which Lord Bacon has praised in Cæsar; a singular power of extinguishing envy. He conversed with men generally upon such topics as they wished, and upon which he knew them acquainted; he never appeared solicitous of distinction; he never assumed; he never seemed doubtful of men's regard, nor anxious for it; he was not the least envious of the standing of other men, and he took his place in all companies as if every body knew it was his, and he himself thought not at all upon it, but was there—no matter how flattering the situation—if we may so express ourselves—naturally. He never seemed to dream that any one, however wealthy or renowned, 27* had the least wish, or would dare for a moment, by slightest word, or tone, or look in his presence, to derogate from his standing or character, (a great point, by the by, in character, this last.) “Willoughby,” said Cavendish to Kentuck, one day, “did you ever see such a fellow as Bradshaw! He takes all this abuse on one side, and puff on the other, as a matter of course; how he has schooled himself, or something else!” “That's a fact!” was the reply. “The truth is, Judge, Bradshaw never seems to presume the least, and he has the profoundest admiration for talent, and would show all deference to its possessor, did he meet him at a dinner party or ball; but the moment Bradshaw was his competitor at the bar, in congress, any where, that moment he would act, as if he were the equal of the greatest man he might so meet, and he has the knack of making the by-standers think it is perfectly a fair match—`Greek meeting Greek.' His friends never feel for him in any situation; the truth is, his ambition is of the loftiest, and he feels now that he is just getting upon the course, where he has a right to enter among the full bloods; and as his strength never yet has been tested, no one knows what he can do. The other day Bradshaw and I dined with Wortley; the old fellow finds that Bradshaw may be a spoke in his wheel, (for though he knows Clinton is opposed to his pretensions to the presidency, yet it is his character to conciliate,) and he was all courtesy.” “Was Carlton there?” “O! yes, Bradshaw and he spoke not to each other. Well, W— was there, the great lion; he voted with Carlton on this certain measure, you know; and, of course, he and Bradshaw differ. W— lugged the measure into conversation, I thought with a spirit bent on controversy; Carlton doing all he could to draw him out. It was not exactly the place, at a dinner table; however, W— talked hard at Bradshaw for some time: I thought him really personal. Bradshaw bore it till he could bear it no longer, and then he entered the list. It was a large dinner party, and all were hushed at the self-possessed sarcastic way Bradshaw took him up. Well, Bradshaw three times set him right with regard to opinions which W— attributed to distinguished men of the revolution; and gave him chapter and verse; and he showed in every respect more knowledge of the subject, more self-possession, and more power. Nobody seemed to think, what is a fact, that he has been thinking upon that subject these six months. He met Carlton upon it, at the meeting called on Carlton's return; and he has since been preparing himself, still on this theme, for the coming stump meetings. You have no idea how Bradshaw studies even his stump speeches. I don't mean the language; that he leaves pretty much to the impulse of the occasion. But there is not a point that may come up in this contest, that Bradshaw has not made himself master of thoroughly. He could get up now out of his bed, if he is in it, and express his opinions, on any subject Carlton may chose to touch upon, right out; and he'll give you the why and wherefore, apparently, as extemporaneously as the morning salutation.” Weeks rolled on. Bradshaw and Carlton had had many stern encounters on the stump. The election day approached. The press on both sides was daily becoming more rabid: both sides were sanguine. Handbills began to be circulated. Often, from the stern strife of politics—a strife with her father, in which every weapon had been used to wound him personally—did Bradshaw turn, in thought, to Mary Carlton, and check the vehemence of his passion; but, with unconquerable will, he kept his energies ever watchful, and his spirit ever firm. Twice he had written to Mary, but had received no answer. His sister, with Mr. Chesterton and Willoughby, had taken a pleasure jaunt to a neighbouring city—or, rather, they had attended Mr. Bradshaw, who had gone on some important business to his church, to a general conference there; and, from her, he could not hear of Mary. A friend, who had passed through the upper part of the state, told him that he had called to see Miss Carlton, who, he understood, was with Mrs. Holliday, at a medicinal spring, which was celebrated for its waters; and that he was told she was not in good health—but he did not see her. “Not well! Why don't I hear from Mary? 'Tis strange!” Such thoughts would occur to Bradshaw a thousand times, in the course of the day; but they would be as often banished by the exciting scenes in which he was an actor, or by the reflection—“She does not like to be here while the contest is going on between her father and myself. She might, at least, write to me. Perhaps she has. The letter may have miscarried: some foul work, may be,”—and again he would be called from love to ambition. “Man's love is, of man's life, a thing apart: 'Tis woman's whole existence!” Where is Mary Carlton? “Daughter!” said Mr. Carlton to Mary, a few days after she had left town, and while she was with Mrs. Holliday, on a farm, where we have said that lady was spending a few weeks, whither Mary Carlton had gone to consult her, and where her father had followed her, a few days afterwards— “Daughter, (the tone was full of gentleness, changed, indeed, from their last meeting,) my dear daughter, I was wrong, very wrong, in wishing you, so peremptority, to marry Mr. Wortley: let that pass—forget it. What can I have, but your happiness, in view? You are my only child. I have none else to leave my fortune to. I was wrong— but, be assured, it is true what I have told you: this Bradshaw is unworthy of you. This girl—this Jane Durham—is a creature, whom, some years since, he defended for murder, and, by some unexpected management, contrived to save from condign punishment. I'm told she is a woman of some attractions; but you may judge what she is, when she was found in that miserable lane, and accused of murder. Be a woman, my daughter—thank God you are saved from him. I have not minced the matter with you. She has been, from that time to this—all the while he was wooing you—his mistress. There is no doubt of it. An intimate friend of mine, who has your interests, your welfare, deeply at heart, informed me of the fact. You have observed, yourself, that the newspapers which I sent you, darkly hinted of it. Before the election day, which is now drawing very near, there will be, I expect, a public exposition of the business. Bradshaw has acted, they say, with great perfidy— though that I cannot well believe, in this instance; for she was a wretched thing, fit for any deed, when he saw her. We have talked it over two or three times. Now, daughter, I don't want you to be precipitate. Remain here till after the election is over—that's all I ask of you—so that you will not be subject to his wily arts; for, be assured, though he loves you, my daughter, so much, as he says,—yet, you may be sure, such is his anxiety to defeat your father in this election, that he will not seek you— he will not think of you; and, surely, your woman's pride, your sense of self-respect, will prevent you from throwing yourself in his way. Consult your aunt, my daughter—you think her your best friend —consult her. I have spoken with her—consult her. Be a woman, daughter—be a woman. Good bye. I must hurry to town. This man, who has so much love for you, my daughter, spares not, on that account, your father. In all my life—now, I may say, an old man, at least, in comparison with him; for I am old enough to be his father,—in all my life, I never have been met with such bold and unsparing denunciation, and sarcastic levity and ridicule, totally devoid of all respect, as from this man. But it is not on my own account, daughter, I thus speak to you—'tis for you. I would save you. I know you are indebted to his family for kindnesses; but do not let your regard for them plead for him. I did not think you would be grieved so much. Be a woman, daughter.” And the father took his leave, mounted his horse, and hastened to town. “Merciful God!” exclaimed Mary, after her father had left the room, “take this load off my heart! Oh! take this load from off my heart—or break it, in thy mercy!—break it, and let me die! No!” she continued, wildly walking across the room—“I will not, must not, cannot, believe it. Can Clinton be so false, so base?—have we not grown up together? Yes! yes!—and this love has twined itself into my very being. If it be true, my woman's pride shall support me, though I die! My father never was so kind to me—he seemed to feel for me. Now, I remember—now, I remember: Clinton did not deny he laughed in the court-house, when Talbot spoke of my engagement to Mr. Wortley; but it—all this my father has told me—may be a trick of Talbot's. But my aunt seems to believe—she, who thought so much of Clinton. O! his baseness! The day of the trial he spoke to Jane Durham, and went with her to the jail—his perfidy! to come to me, with his endearments, from this wanton's” — She buried her face in her hands. “There's aunt coming. I will consult her. Aunt, what shall I do?” said Mary, struggling to be self-possessed. “My dear niece,” said Mrs. Holliday, taking her hand affectionately, “I do not know what to think of it. I have always believed that Clin—that Mr. Bradshaw was attached to you. I have always thought him a young man of high honour; and I have often looked forward to the time, with pride and pleasure, when you and he would be one; (Mary wept;) but—but, if this is true; and, really, these hints in the newspaper—what your father says—what I told you Nancy, the apple-woman, said to me, when this girl was tried—it had slipped my mind, as an idle gossip, until I heard your father's account, and then it occurred to me,—I can hardly believe it, Mary, after all; but, dear, we will go to the springs, and stay there awhile. Be comforted: all may yet be well; but if it is true, niece, you must forget him.” Mary spoke not for a moment, and then exclaimed, “I will try, I will—but, aunt we—I—let us go to the springs; let us go to the springs, aunt.” Mrs. Holliday left the room, and Mary continued to herself—“I had no letter from Clinton, from — county; he said he would write. He will not write to me here, expecting me home; nor will Emily. If he does write, what's that to me?—I will return them; he shall explain all his conduct—and—and —he will—he will.” Accordingly, Mary and her aunt passed into the interior of the state, to the springs. But Mary could not quiet her spirit, or regain her vivacity; she tried to rally her pride—for there was much of it in her character; but for once it failed. Her first girlish preference had been for Bradshaw, and never, for one moment, had a rival crossed him in her dream of love. If she had reached womanhood before love usurped her thought, and “fancy free' had gone forth into the world, the courted of many, before she made a choice, such was her character, that, perhaps, she never could have been o'er mastered by the passion so entirely. But, the boy who won her heart—how superior to all the boys around him! and the man who held her heart, had realized more than the promises of his boyhood had given. The voice, that in itself was the most eloquent she had ever heard, had gushed out in tenderness to her—had praised her above all, in her childhood. The eye, that in itself was the brightest she had ever seen, for years had looked in hers with glances that, each year, the more told her were love's. That voice had grown deeper; there was more pathos in it; and the eye had grown darker, and there was more fire in its beam; but voice nor eye had not altered in the passion they expressed; they had but learned to express it with more intense power. The past to her was but a memory of him—and to the future she had sent hope forth like the dove from the ark; it had returned with a promise, and gone forth again and found a resting place. Alas! thought she, where the bitter waters must o'erwhelm me. At last, after they had been at the springs some time, Mary said to her aunt, “My dear aunt, this doubt, with nothing to confirm or destroy it, I cannot bear; let us go to town. There may be—there is something false and foul in all this: at least, when I see Emily, I will speak plainly to her and to Clinton, and know the truth, and act accordingly. I cannot bear this—let us go, my dear aunt, to town; come, do, dearest aunt, let us go; we will get in just after the election—if it is true, it is all told: this suspense, I cannot bear it. I am peevish, aunt, forgive me”—and she threw her arms round her aunt's neck, and sobbed aloud. Vol. II. 28 To please Mary, Mrs. Holliday, who felt a mother's attachment for her, immediately gave orders for their departure. They travelled the first half day in her carriage; but, in making a sudden turn, in a declivity of the road, which was very rough, the fore wheel of the vehicle was broken. Luckily, no one was hurt; but, in such an out of the way place, it was impossible soon to get the wheel repaired. The accommodation stage came up as they were standing beside the broken carriage, and deliberating what to do. There were, happily, vacant seats in it; and the baggage was transferred from the carriage, which was left in the charge of the coachman, with orders to have it repaired, and away dashed the stage. Travelling in the stage, they arrived in town sooner than was their calculation, when they started in Mrs. Holliday's carriage, as they travelled much faster. It was on the evening previous to the election, an hour after nightfall, that the stage dashed into the city.— “Where shall I set you down?” asked the driver of the passengers. Mrs. Holliday told where her residence was. Another passenger said, that his residence was immediately on the way to Mrs. Holliday's. “Do you know,” asked he, “where Mr. Glassman lives?” “What? Glassman the lawyer?” “Yes.” “I live just three doors above.” “Ay, ay,” ejaculated the driver. The stage soon stopped at the last mentioned passenger's door; a hack that had been rattling behind it for the last square, stopped at the door immediately below. Mary Carlton was seated on the back seat of the stage next to the house, and having heard that June Durham lived near Glassman's, her attention was acutely directed to the hack. “Let's have a light!” said the stage driver to the passenger, as the latter descended from the vehicle, “and tell us which is your trunk?” At the moment the stage passenger returned with a light, the door of the house below opened, and two persons—a male and female came forth. Mary Carlton started, could it be Clinton Bradshaw, and was that the girl he defended for murder? The female took the man's arm, the hack door was opened, and as he was assisting her in, she said, in a soft voice— “Wait one moment, I have forgotten something.” She turned, and in a quick step re-entered the house. The man advanced towards the stage and asked the driver, “Jerry, what to they say of the election up the country?” At this moment, the light shone full upon the face of the speaker, and Mary Carlton recognised at once, the voice and the features of Clinton Bradshaw. “Squire, is that you?” said Jerry, leaving a strap half unbuckled, and advancing to take Bradshaw's proffered hand. “Yes, Jerry: how goes the election in the county?” “Why, squire, at Pottstown, you'll have to crack your whip the hardest—I'm mightily thinking the old chap 'll beat you there—at long swamp, it'll be neck and neck,” continued Jerry, resuming his occupation, as Bradshaw turned towards the female, who, at this moment, descended the steps of the door below: “but they do say, that all round the country, by your fathers'—I was up through there dealing in horses, last week—they do say, that you'll beat him.” “Are you ready, Jane?” said Bradshaw to the female. “Yes,” said she, and he handed her into the carriage, and followed himself, calling out as the door closed on him—“Good night to you, Jerry; crack your whip loud, to-morrow, Jerry, and have your hacks out early.” “Ay, ay, squire, there's no miss in me,” replied Jerry, as the hack drove off. “There's your trunk,” continued Jerry, to the passenger. “Dang it! this here smashed buckle kept me a long time. The squire's a keener—he's wide awake on all pints, I tell you—I wonder what he's after, now. Gosh! he'll run to-morrow like furies.” “I hope not,” said the passenger, as Jerry mounted his box, “but I wouldn't care much where he runs, if he wouldn't run to — ” “Ha, ha!” exclaimed Jerry, cracking his whip, “you don't bet on him, hey—you go for the old racer;” and away rattled the stage. “Come, niece, love, get out, my dear,” said Mrs. Holliday, who had descended from the stage, at her door, and stood offering her hand to Mary. “Yes, aunt, yes,” said Mary, mechanically stepping out, and entering the house with her aunt. “It's true, aunt; it's all true,” said she, throwing herself on the sofa;—it's all true: dear, dear aunt, shall we go back again?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. The day of the election was one of great excitement. Long before the polls were opened, groups might be seen at the corners, and in other places discussing the prospects of the candidates; and through the whole day hacks were traversing the city, in all directions, bringing up the maimed, the halt, and the blind, to the polls. Horsemen dashed from ward to ward, from county to town, and from town to county, in restless desire, to ascertain the state of the election; or bound, perhaps, on some tricky errand of manœuvring or betting. All sorts of reports, and rumours of reports, were current, of the changes in such a township, of the effect produced in such a ward, by such a speech, of the great odds offered in a bet that was refused, of the injury such a handbill had done such a candidate in a certain quarter, &amp;c. &amp;c. Just after the polls were opened, handbills were circulated in quantities, giving a purient account of an unfortunate young creature, named Jane Durham, who had been seduced, and abducted no one knew whither, by Bradshaw. It was alleged, that he had forced her into a hack the previous evening, and that, since, she had not been heard of, &amp;c. &amp;c. An account somewhat inconsistent with previous reports, as related by Mr. Carlton to his daughter. 28* With indefatigable perseverance, Bradshaw visited the polls throughout the town, and in the county, as far as time and distance would permit. The place of voting in one of the wards was at the hotel, immediately opposite Mrs. Holliday's; and Mary Carlton sat at the window, a most unhappy observer of the crowd. The handbill charging her lover with the seduction of Jane Durham, had been thrown in the door, and Sue had brought it to her. With heavy heart, she now sat looking into the bustling street—the scene fell with a deep depression on her feelings—“He will be elected,” she thought, “and think no more of me, I ought to thank heaven that he quarrelled with my father, or I never should have discovered his character, until too late. With what seeming tenderness he helped that poor deceived creature into the carriage last night!” While indulging such sad thoughts, which she in vain attempted to banish from her mind, she at once was startled from her vacant look at the crowd, on beholding Bradshaw ride up rapidly to the polls. He was on horseback; and the moment his friends recognised, they gathered around him. He laughed and talked gaily with them, while they eagerly shook hands with him. She observed him cast his eye towards the house. He does not think of me, she thought. In a minute he descended from his horse, and, giving the reins to a boy standing by, crossed the street. “Will he dare,” said Mary to herself, with an indignant countenance, “will he dare to come here?” She had scarcely said it, when Bradshaw, who stopped not to ring the bell, entered the room. He sprang towards her, but she started back, with a “beautiful disdain” upon her lip, and with averted head, waved him away with her hand. “Why, Mary, are you angry, love? In what have I offended? You are like Sheridan's description of justice, `lovely, though in your frown—”' “Justice, sir—begone! carry your false words and your false—Mr. Bradshaw, this is intrusion, sir. Will you not go? If you will not leave the room, I must.” “Mary, explain to me the meaning of all this. I understand you not!” “I understand you, sir, thoroughly. I'm a witness, though not a willing witness, of your—words are idle. Allow me the privilege of choosing my own company, Mr. Bradshaw—or, if you are determined to remain, I bid you good morning, sir.” “Mary, this is some strange mistake. Explain —why not explain? In what have I offended you? to what do you allude? Has Talbot again—” “No, sir; no Talbot again. Your friends are calling you, sir—if you are determined to entertain them in my aunt's house, you must excuse my presence.” She walked towards the folding-doors. Bradshaw heard his name called repeatedly, in the street. Advancing to Mary, he asked, “Shall I have no explanation, Mary? I conjure you, by every thing you hold sacred, to tell me what this means? If there is—let me know what there is—” “I am myself a witness, sir. I was in the stage, and saw you bear off that—that woman.” At this moment, one of Bradshaw's friends, who was a little elated, and who had seen him enter Mrs. Holliday's, followed after, regardless of time and place, in his anxiety to inform him of the handbill against him. As Bradshaw turned to him, Mary Carlton left the room. Bradshaw led his political friend out, for he required some assistance, and, after listening to his maudlin talk for some time, he, with great difficulty, got rid of him. “I see it,” said he to himself, as he mounted his horse; “I understand it now. Carlton has told Mary of this Jane Durham case; and she saw me with her last night. Talbot is at the bottom of all this—his time's come. What a spirit spoke in Mary's eye! What dignity—but—I—I—” Here one of Bradshaw's friends rode up to him, and away they went together. “Bradshaw, you must stir your stumps,” said his friend, as they rode rapidly off: “the old fellow's running like the deuce. These infernal handbills were out, in the upper part of the county, yesterday, and the report is that they are doing you a great injury among the farmers.” Let us return to Mary. “Where did these books come from, Sue?” asked Mary Carlton, of the servant girl, as the latter entered her room, with a number of souvenirs and annuals in her hand. “Mr. Longshore, ma'am, who cleans Mr. Bradshaw's office, brought them, miss. He says Mr. Bradshaw sent 'em.” “Ay, he cleans his office! is that it? and sends me home my books. Put them on the foot of the bed, by me, Sue;—and, Sue, I'm not at home if any body should call.—Emily Bradshaw—Did you see Pete in the market this morning?” “O! yes, Miss Mary, and I forgot it till this minute. Miss Emily got home late last night.” “If she should come in, Sue, of course, I'm home; but come and tell me when she comes, first, before I see her. Do I look as if I were not well, Sue?” “You looks a little pale, Miss Mary; and your voice sounds a little as if you —” “No matter—Oh! no matter!—As if you— what?” “As if you were troubled, Miss Mary.” “There, put the books there.—Don't shut the door.” Mary Carlton opened one of the books, and in a blank leaf cast her eyes on some hastily written lines, in Bradshaw's handwriting. With a quick glance she read— The tears of early love are like The gentle rains of spring; They fall while sunshine laughs, and birds, Like hope, are on the wing. Thus, when first we parted, Mary, We wept away the pain, While passion, like the opening bud, Grew in the dewy rain. But when love is wrapped in wo, And tears refuse to start,— Then has the arid season come That withers up the heart. Thus, when last we parted, Mary, There fell no dewy rain,— And dry will be the fountains, Mary, Ere we meet again. “That `arid season' has, indeed, come,” said Mary; “that `dewy rain' can fall no more! no more!”—and she buried her head in her pillow, and burst into a flood of tears. Late in the afternoon, we next find Bradshaw. With now a bent and angry brow, and now a gentle smile, he was talking with his sister, at the door of the Purchase; Pete was standing at the gate, holding his horse: the animal was all in a foam. “Tell her all, my dear sister—as you love me, tell her all!” were the words he was uttering as we thus find him. “My dear brother, I will—I will, if I understand you; but you speak very incoherently.” “Here, give her this letter—'tis Talbot's own confession. She'll understand—my friends wait for me—they'll wonder, in town, where I am—it may hurt my election. 'Tis this way, Emily, 'tis this way,—listen, dearest sister, to me,—as Kentuck has told you, Talbot, in a most dastardly manner, attempted my life in an oyster cellar the day Johnson—you were at the trial—was tried for murder. We only suspected it at the time. Since—the other day—two gentlemen who were taking oysters in an adjoining room, came to me, knowing the manner Talbot was acting in this election, came to me, and gave me a certificate that they saw him cock the pistol and fire at me while my back was turned, and I was opening the door to let Kentuck in; Kentuck persuaded me not to publish the certificate, to wait till after the election. This morning I saw Mary—I have told you of what passed between us. Talbot, I knew, was at the bottom of the report—the handbill. Mary was in the stage—she saw me hand Jane Durham into a hack—tell her that Glassman is in the hospital insane, after a fit of intemperance: I heard of it late in the afternoon. I took Jane Durham to see him—she is the only one who can do any thing with him. That's all—tell her so, on my honour. I have ridden away out in the country,—Talbot got up this handbill—he skulked away. A fellow who lives just above Jane Durham's, a friend of Carlton's, told him of this `seduction and abduction.' I showed him—Talbot—the certificates, and threatened to publish them. I told him so before his father and family; and he made the confession, to prevent the publication. Tell Mary all, do, dearest sister, all—all. Ride right in, sister—I must be off—get her to come out to the Purchase with you; she will, I know, if you persuade her. I will be out by twelve o'clock to-night—the expresses will be all in then, and we shall know who is elected”—Bradshaw mounted his horse. “Oh, sis!—I saw Sue, as I was starting from town to go in search of Talbot; from what I gathered from her, Mary thought I returned those books, in consequence of what took place this morning: at least, so I suspect. Say to Mary, that Cavendish and I had taken another office; and I ordered the man, when he moved the books, to take Mary's to her. God bless you—we shall know by twelve o'clock who's elected—bring Mary out with you—show her the letter—she'll come.” “Clinton! Clinton!” called out Emily, “don't harm Talbot. Oh, do not expose him!” “Not I, my fair sis. Show that letter to Mary —not I. But he may thank Kentuck for it; I would have done it—blazoned his infamy to the world. I told him to-day what my uncle Toby said to the fly—but not in his benevolent spirit; and I made a kind of exception, I told him there was room enough in the wide world for both of us, but not in our small city; so he'll take up his line of march, and he and Scrags may hang out their banners as leaders in whatever city of refuge scoundrels most do congregate; but not when there's any courage to be displayed. Pete, I owe you a fip; I can't stop to put my hand in my pocket— come right in, sis”—and away he dashed. On reaching the city, Bradshaw rode immediately to Jackson's livery stable, changed his horse, and then proceeded to visit the different wards. People were rushing to the polls, as the hour of closing them drew near, and a great excitement prevailed. Both sides were sanguine, and betting ran very high; but without any odds given on either side: or, if on either, by the friends of Carlton. Night closed in, and the people gathered in crowds around the printing offices to hear the returns, as they were brought in by express. The friends of Carlton congregated round the Gazette office, and those of Bradshaw round the Mechanics' Advocate, (Jekyl's.) Though the offices were several squares apart, one party could distinctly hear the shouts and hurras of the other, as the returns were read. When there was a shout at the Gazette office, a dead silence reigned over the multitude by Jekyl's, and whenever they shouted, no echo came from the other quarter—while individuals might be seen hastening from one office to the other, anxious to know what were the reports among their opponents, and to discover from their tone and conversation, their hopes and fears. The night went on leaden wings. At last an express from the county came in, all the townships were heard from, except the Purchase. “It's very strange,” said Jekyl, “we don't hear from Purchase township.” “It has been bought up,” exclaimed some punster. “A great many votes were taken there. Carlton, you say, is a-head one hundred and thirty,” said Bradshaw. “Close scratching, by Jove! According to their calculation, what majority did they give me in that township?” “Not more than fifty,” said one. “You're wrong,” said Jekyl,—“one hundred.” “How many votes have been counted at the Purchase?” asked Bradshaw. “I don't know—but that's the largest township.” “How many votes were taken?” “Don't know—but they say a larger number than ever was taken before.” “That counts in my favour,” said Bradshaw— “at least, I think so. Hear how the Carlton men are shouting! It comes on the night breeze, a complete whoop of exultation. You're not through the woods yet, gentlemen. I've been thoroughly through that township, and—” “I'm afeared we're a case, Mr. Bradshaw!” interrupted one. “Hear how the fools shout!” said Geirson, the man in whose behalf Bradshaw made his first speech. “Yes!—hear to 'em!” said another. “Wait awhile, boys. I think I know the Purchase. If there were as many votes polled there Vol. II. 29 as is generally believed, I'll run him hard. I may turn a sharp corner on him, yet.” “We hope so, squire!—we hope so!” exclaimed they, simultaneously. At this moment, a great bustle was heard without, while the shouts from the Carlton quarter ceased. “The last express is in!” called out the crowd. “The news! the news!” “Bradshaw's elected!” called out Jekyl. “He leads, in Purchase township, three hundred votes!” “By Jove!” exclaimed Bradshaw, dashing the tear from his eye: “that gives me more pleasure than the victory. The lads that I have grown up with, were true to their old school-mate. I thought they would be. I thought I knew them.” “Let's shout like thunder!” exclaimed Geirson, “and let the other fellows hear us now.” Jekyl announced to the crowd without, the vote, and they made the welkin ring again with their cheers. “Bradshaw!” “Bradshaw!” “Bradshaw!” they shouted. Lights were placed in the window, at which Bradshaw made his appearance; and, after being greeted with the most enthusiastic hurras, he returned his thanks to his friends, in language glowing from the heart—in a manner that almost reconciled those of his opponents, who chanced to be by, to his election.” After this, a procession, headed by a band of music, was formed by Bradshaw's friends, and they escorted him to Broadbelt's establishment, where they insisted upon having another speech from him. Bradshaw found at Broadbelt's Mr. Chesterton, together with Selman and Cavendish, and, on asking for Kentuck, he was told, that, as soon as the result was known, he had mounted his horse and gone to the Purchase. Bradshaw burned to follow him, but he could not tear himself away from his friends. “The pedagogue, rod in hand, chased the urchin hard,” said the Judge, “but the urchin out-ran him.” “Ha! ha! you're alluding,” exclaimed Mr. Chesterton, “ugh—you're alluding to my caricature, hey! not a bad notion that. Boy, (to Bradshaw,) this southern sun improves the puritan breed— your mother is a southerner, hey! you'll see what a race Willy 'll raise: by the—ugh—by, speaking of such thing, I saw old Carlton at Mrs. Holliday's.” “Was Mary there?” “Ugh—ugh—why do you interrupt? I didn't see her. I told the old fellow, plumply, that he had been deceived by that wily dog—ugh—Talbot, and that his daughter would have you, and he couldn't help it—ugh—he was as wrothy as Mrs. Pomona—my apple woman—my goddess, ha! ha! said he wouldn't give her one cent—ugh—ugh— he's rabid. I told him, if things worked right, (winking at Bradshaw,) he might be senator, if he was beaten for Congress. Egad! he takes it hard: he raged; he blew like a porpoise—but I'll manage him.” Bradshaw stole away from Mr. Chesterton, whispered to Cavendish he was not very well, and requested him, if any one should ask for him, to say that he was so much fatigued and unwell, that he had gone home. “I will, Bradshaw; you ought to go; you look worn out: they'll excuse you; but don't let them see you going. I don't often frolic; but I am determined to go it to-night. We'll drink to you in bumpers. Selman's married now; a tipsy frolic won't harm him as much as formerly—hey, Hal?” “It was on Bradshaw's account that I got high before,” said Selman, with some little confusion, “and he got me off; so, if I go in for it now, and there's any—ahem,” clearing his throat, “Bradshaw must bear the blame, and plead the cause. `It is the cause, it is the cause,' hey, Bradshaw, as Othello says.” “Ah! Selman,” said Bradshaw, shaking his hand, “if matrimony has reconciled you to quotations, I know you're a happy man.” So saying, Bradshaw stole away. After some little delay at the livery stable, he obtained a horse; and, giving him the spur and the rein, he went with the speed of Dick Turpin, or Mazeppa, but with far different feelings. He dashed on with a swelling heart. “I have my foot on the ladder,” said he, “and I'll mount—how our neighbours stuck to me!—it made me feel prouder than I ever in my life felt before. When Carlton and I met at the Purchase polls to-day, and the old farmers gathered round me, and left him alone in his glory, I felt like Rob Roy on his native heath, when he proclaimed himself M`Gregor. And my old schoolmates, how they stood for me; and Kentuck, Selman, Jekyl, the Judge, old Chesterton, true as steel—Talbot's expatriated, hey! I've done good deeds to-day; and, by the light of heaven, if ever he return to the city, that certificate—his infamy, shall go forth upon the four winds. And Mary, the only woman I have ever loved—my boyhood's worship—my manhood's passion, idolatry, pride—how wasted and wan she looked! I felt at once, deep in my heart's core, how much I loved her. And she—how completely a woman. That wan look of hers; though pride, wounded pride, flashed in her eye, told me, indeed, I was beloved. I do love such a spirit as hers; and then her all-surpassing beauty, and her gifts of intellect—Clinton Bradshaw,” he exclaimed, rising in his stirrups, and speaking to his horse, that at the word sprang forward at full speed; “Clinton Bradshaw, you will win your way in this broad world. 'Tis a good omen to be the elected of your lady love, and your countrymen, on the same day. But is Mary at the Purchase?—am I her elected? I trust in God Emily has explained it all. There's the moon; she is above the clouds, at last; they obscure her path no more—she is leaving them like young ambition—gloriously she beameth.” Here he reached the Purchase gate: his horse was so restless and excited, that he could not turn his head to the gate, so as to open it. He had to dismount. As he threw the gate open, the horse, with a bound, broke from him, and darted away. “You're a free spirit!” exclaimed Bradshaw, “and good luck to you!” As the nearest way to the house, Bradshaw cut across the orchard that was intersected by the lane; and in this direction he approached the side of the dwelling. The house was an old-fashioned one, as we have said, of but one story. Through the shutters of his father's Vol. II. 30 chamber, which were partly open, he saw a light streaming. He trod noiselessly, and looked in— He beheld his father on his knees, by a stand on which stood a light. A Bible was open before him, and, with his hands extended on the open page, he was praying fervently. There was no one in the room but his father, and Bradshaw stood with filial awe contemplating the picture. The light shone full upon his parent's long gray hairs, amidst which it beamed, while his fine features wore the expression of deep devotion. Intensely Bradshaw listened. “Oh, most holy Father!” said the parent, in a fervent voice, “as thou hast vouchsafed to bestow upon him a superior mind—a mind to control his fellows—guide and guard him in the path of rectitude, and patriotism—endue him from on high with the energy of virtue. Let the stern love of liberty of conscience, which brought his forefathers to this happy land, sink deep into his heart. Make him thy servant, Father. Teach him to act for thy glory, and for thy people's good. Make him the succour of the friendless—the righter of the wronged. Let not a usurping ambition mislead him from thee. Temper and chasten his spirit in its aspirings; and let them only be in the cause of virtue and of truth. Teach him to know what thy Son has taught; and oh, enable him to practise it! Give him strength from on high, most holy Father! And, Parent of all mercy, if thy servant has felt vain-glorious in his success; if I have nursed an unchristian pride, forgive”—Here Mr. Bradshaw bowed his head upon the Bible, and his voice became so tremulous that his son could not hear him. Clinton leaned against the house, and wept. At this moment he heard a voice within a few feet of him, say, in soliloquy, “I wonder Clinton does not come. Oh, what a load is from my heart!” He turned—it was Mary Carlton, who, when the moon shone forth, had stepped out to look and listen for him. “Mary—my Mary!” said Bradshaw. “Clinton, oh Clinton!” and she threw her arms around him, and buried her head in his bosom.
