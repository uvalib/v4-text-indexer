      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. A RAY FROM THE EAST. YOUNG Mr. Edward Wetherel and his more mature friend Mr. Frank Wolverton were on the after promenade deck of the steamer Elm City, bound from New York to New Haven. âYes, I see her,â said Wolverton, looking at the young lady whom Wetherel was pointing out to him. âPretty girl. Shines like a star. Wonderful air of innocence. Who is she?â âI think I shall astonish you, Wolverton,â replied Wetherel, obviously taking much pleasure in talking about this young lady. âShe is the daughter of a missionary.â âMissionary! You do astonish me. One has an idea that such people don't have children, or have little monsters of plainness and grimness. A fellow naturally thinks, you know, that a missionary's daughter would only make a show in society on the principle that handsome is as handsome does. Where does she come from?â âFrom the Nestorian country, somewhere in Persia, I fancy. Her father is quite a famous man among his set, I understand. He has done some notorious wrestling with heathenism, or whatever the religion of the country may be. `The celebrated Doctor Bernard.' I heard a white-cravated gentleman call him.â âHe had better leave his missionarying to his daughter,â pronounced Wolverton, gazing steadily at the girl, and with a gentler expression in his eyes than was habitual with them. âI don't believe the celebrated Doctor Bernard could hold a candle to such a young lady in the work of bringing over misbelievers. If I were the chief high priest of the Nestorians, or whatever they call themselves, and that little beauty should ask me to break down my altars and forsake the faith of my ancestors. I should say, Certainly! any little thing of the sort to please you.â This talk was both jesting and serious. The two men spoke lightly of the missionary âwork,â obviously to them a dim and unimportant quixotism; but with regard to the girl they were entirely sincere and respectful. Of the solemnity of religious matters they had apparently no more perception than if they had been denizens of some planet to which no divine revelation, whether natural or verbal, had ever been granted. The worshipfulness of beauty, however, they could see plainly, and they were creditably sensitive, as it appeared, to maidenly purity. Personally these two civilized heathens were themselves worthy of admiring consideration. Wolverton, although not much short of forty, was as agreeable to the artistic eye as many much younger men are, his curling black hair being still fresh and glossy, his large brown eyes healthfully clear and resolute, his darkly-pale cheek as firm in look as marble, and his broad, muscular figure fit for a boat race. Wetherel, who might have been about twenty-five, was tall, flexible, and graceful, with a blonde complexion, waving light hair, intelligent gray eyes, and features in the main regular. The defect in his face was a chin too prominent, too domineering, and we might say too virile. Even in a man one would like to see more meekness of temper and persuasibility of mind than this chin permitted. Both were dressed with a scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste which indicated a brahminic position in society. Only the rich and leisurely, only those who have been able to give their lives to dandyism, can attain to such faultlessness of costume. They were in summer suits, and yet they mirrored the fashions. It seemed as if dust would stop short in its flight toward such neatness, and as if grime would fall reverentially at its feet without soiling it. Spectators of the workaday class, if of a humble-minded and impressible nature, might easily imagine such clothing as exhaling an aroma of daintiness and giving forth a halo of high-breeding. Of a hot summer's day it would have seemed little less than abnormal and monstrous to be so vestured in neatness and freshness and triumphal grace as were these lilies of the club and the drawing-room. But the day, although sultry enough on shore to remind one of the air of forges, was breezy and restorative on the deck of the Elm City. The stainless flannel coats and delicate silken scarfs of the two dandies were appropriate to the cleansed and sweetened air which blew over the azure wavelets of Long Island Sound. âLook at her now,â said Wolverton, attracted by some change in the countenance of the girl whom he was watching, one of those beautiful changes which come over young and innocent faces, the reflections of a fawn-like enjoyment of life. âI never saw such another entangling, attaching face.â Then he added, after a long pause as if for a deep sigh, âNever but once! There is something tremendous in the power of a resemblance. I don't mind telling you, youngsterâin fact it is a sober sort of pleasure for me to tell youâthat I have seen such a face as that once before, and that it was the angelic sight of my life. Death is a scoundrelly robber. If that face had not been carried beyond my sight, I should have passed my life beneath it, looking up to it. I have been a worse man for being plundered in that way. Well,â he concluded with another sigh, âthat was seven years ago. I wish we could smoke here.â The younger man looked at the elder with respectful astonishment. He had discovered a heart where he had little looked to find one. He was like one who, wandering through halls of gayety and watching the feet of dancers, beholds the bloodstain of a bygone tragedy. In the unexpected presence of revelations of this sorrowful aspect, the eyes of the lightest and hardest are apt to fill with solemn wonder, or at least with pitying curiosity. âYou, Wolverton!â said Wetherel, in a tone of pensive amazement. Then he changed the subject, for he had some capacity of delicate sympathy in him or at least he had its counterpart, good-breeding. âOf course we can smoke on the forward deck,â he added. âDo you particularly care for it?â âNo. I would rather look at this girl.â âDo you want to talk with her? I know her well enough to take you up.â âNo. The charm might pass away. It wouldn't be the same voice. I prefer to look at her. By the way, where did you meet her?â âOn the steamer from England.â âOh, the steamer! Jolly place for courting, an ocean steamer,â said Wolverton, throwing off his rarely-worn seriousness, and appearing once more in the spiritual garb of a veteran of society. âYour romance kills mine. Of course you two became intimate and walked arm in arm by the moonlight, and all that sort of thing. So she is just in the country, just fresh from the missionary harvest, just from the Orient! How odd and interesting our stupid American life must seem to her! She is having emotions every minute. I wish to heaven I was young again. The greatest pleasure I know now is to take a child to the theatre and watch its wonder. I shall have to smoke,â he added, turning serious once more. âGo and talk to the new soul from Mount Ararat. Show her the tower of Babel.â With the serious face of a wearied worldling who remembers that he once came near living a better life than that of egoism, he drew from his pocket the consolation of a cigar-case, and sought the forecastle deck of the steamer. Wetherel, left to himself, wavered hither and thither an instant, and then advanced to the young lady. She did not see him; her eyes were fixed on the distant blue shore of Connecticut; they were settled, pensive, and almost sad, as if longing for the far-away home. âNestoria?â he asked. âWhat?â she replied, looking up at him with inquiry and surprise, while a fairy mob of blushes rushed into her cheeks. âHave I spoken the magic name?â he smiled. âIt is my name,â she confessed. âHow did you know it?â âWhat! Is your name Nestoria?â he almost exclaimed, so interesting was the discovery. âI did not know it at all, and couldn't have guessed it. I supposed you were thinking of your native mountains. So I asked you, Nestoria?â âOh!â And here the blushes rioted again, fighting in a field of lilies. âSo I exposed myself.â âDon't you like the name?â he wondered, for he had already decided that it was a charming one. âI ought. My father likes it; and it is his field. He named me after the people among whom he labors. And yet I can't quite like it. People ask me so many questions about it, and exclaim so much about it; such a strange name! and oh, what a beautiful name! and isn't it singular? I am so tired of hearing about it that I call myself Nettie. Nestoria sounds too grand for a little bit of a woman. Don't you think so? It seems like blowing a trumpet before me. I like Nettie best.â âI like both,â responded the New York dandy and man-about-town. The tender seriousness with which he treated the subject was certainly curious in a practised beau who had the fame of being a lady-killer. It was also very agreeable; it ridded him of the confident smile and fatuous levity with which he was wont to spoil the effect of his compliments; it enabled him to say his pleasant thing with a sincere tone, which made it gracious and effective. It must be understood that he already knew the missionary's daughter well, and liked her much. Eleven days of close companionship on shipboard had made them intimates, and had landed him on that island of sorceries where men see women as seraphs. He knew the girl's whole history; he had drawn from her long reminiscences of her secluded, strange life in Erzeroum and the Kurdish mountains; he had heard her tell of turbaned chiefs and veiled beauties until it seemed a wonder to him that she wore familiar vestments and spoke English; he had looked at her through the enchantment of distance, and clothed her in the mystery of the Orient, and made a poem of her. She was, in many ways, like an inhabitant of some other world to him. Her ideas were as novel and curious as her recollections. She knew almost nothing of the fashionable, worldly existence which was nearly all that he did know. She was as ignorant and innocent as if she had just come out of the Garden of Eden. Even her language was odd to him; it sounded in his ears as did the speech of Christian and Faithful in the ears of the men of âVanity Fairâ; he was at first displeased, then amused, and then charmed when she talked of âthe missionary work,â of âChristian labors,â of âthe conversion of the East.â These phrases sounded like cant, but in a little while they sounded like poetry. He likened himself to an angel of darkness who should take a fancy to the society of a cherub fresh from Paradise. What a fascination there was in her innocence and simplicity! When he told her that he liked both her names she did not guess why; she looked up at him with a childlike expression that was part surprise and part pleasure. He had never before seen such virginity of soul, and he had the exultation of a navigator who discovers a new island hitherto unvisited by mortals. âDid you ever know any one called Nettie?â she asked; meaning, did you like her, and so like the name? âI never did,â he answered smiling, because he understood the drift of the question, and was charmed with the lack of egotism which it proved. âThen why ââ she hesitated. âOh, they are pretty names,â he said, feeling that he was on the brink of an abyss, and drawing back from it. He did not dare to say, âI like the names because I like the person who bears them;â for an interior thrill warned him that the confession might have a mighty momentum in it; and he was not yet prepared for a declaration of love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. A BEGINNING OF SORROW. âThey are both pretty names,â Wetherel repeated, unable to let the fascinating subject alone. âAnd of the two I think I like Nestoria the best. If I were related to you, I should call you Nestoria.â The girl wanted to say, âYou may call me so,â but after reflecting a moment, it seemed best not. The young man's eyes were bent upon her face with an expression of admiration which she did not fully comprehend, but which nevertheless embarrassed her and thwarted her childlike confidence. Of course the most potent spring of the dandy's admiration for Nestoria was her beauty. Her guilelessness of character and her puritanisms of speech would have appeared to him ridiculous, had she been homely. But he found it impossible to laugh at her, impossible not to grant her a certain worship when he looked at her. She was certainly quite handsome, and there were moments when she dazzled. At first you hardly noticed this little figure, and this infantile blonde face. But presently you could not help remarking how regular the small features were, how delicate the rose and lily complexion, and how heaven-like the blue eyes. Then came a revelation of golden hair, so luxuriant as to remind one of fields of yellow corn, and bright through all its wavings with an inner sunshine. This hair had fascinated Wetherel; one stormy day on the ocean it had burst its bonds and flooded the girl to the waist; and he never afterwards escaped from the bewildering influence of those radiant tresses. It was from the date of that aureate inundation that he began to find all Nestoria's ways, all her retired, prim ideas, and all her puritanic phrases, no longer displeasing or odd, but charming. All the sense and self-command that he possessed had been needed to keep him from making downright court to the girl on the Cunarder; and indeed, nothing but luck, nothing but accidental interventions of fellow-passengers, had delivered him from the snares set for him by certain moonlights. One might think that the obscurities of evening would have shorn the brilliance from a beauty of which color formed so great a part. But it was not so; this child could spare the rose, the lily, and the gold; her features were fine enough for that. And the moonlight so idealized her, it made her so like ethereal marble, it gave her such a brightness of better worlds, that she seemed more than human. Like a star she grew in loveliness as evening gathered its magic veils about her. Wetherel, who was half a pagan in education and almost wholly pagan in soul, used to think of Venus rising from the sea and of Cyprian multitudes bowing in adoration. Well, he had not proposed to her during the ocean voyage; but he had shown his interest so plainly that a coquette would have been aware of a conquest; and even this innocent from Kurdistan had perceived that she was liked. They were well acquainted; when they met on the Elm City it was as two old friends meet; it seemed to each of them that they had known each other forever. As the boat wound up the picturesque turns of the East River Wetherel had pointed out to Nestoria all the objects of note, delighting in her naive pleasure and wonder. Then, discovering Wolverton, his model and mentor in the ways of worldliness, he had joined him for a moment to show him Nestoria and to enjoy his admiration. And now, Wolverton having gone to his lonely solace of a cigar, he had fluttered back moth-like to his candle. As that luminary made no response to his declared preference for her name of Nestoria, and as he felt that the subject might be perilous to his bachelor freedom if he should pursue it, he looked about the visible cosmos for another. âHow perfectly beautiful the sea is to-day,â was his commonplace remark, greatly ennobled to him, however, by the feeling which prompted it. Try as he would to evade the dominion of this girl, he could not utter a word which was not pervaded by her. The sea was more to him than its wont, simply because it served as a background to her face and figure, and thus seemed to partake of her personality. Everything that he looked upon in her company acquired beauty in his eyes, for the reason that she also beheld it. Within the last fortnight he had discovered a new heaven and a new earth, hitherto unknown to him and even unsuspected. It is pretty clear that, notwithstanding some remaining anchor of prudence, his heart was beginning to drift dangerously. We can understand now the prompt and serious sympathy which he had accorded to Wolverton's tale of shipwrecked love. âIt is beautiful,â replied Nestoria, her clear blue eyes looking down like two little cloudless heavens upon the indigo wavelets. Then, with a pathetic expression of sadness, resignation, and awe, she added, âAnd wonderful!â She wanted to say, âTerrible!â The ocean represented to her a majesty and power which were more than earthly; there were moments when it seemed to carry her off, as a little speck, beyond the bounds of time; moments when it was no longer an ocean, but an eternity. A feeling of intense loneliness and a longing remembrance of her only parent, so far away, deepened this sentiment of solemnity and also touched it with tenderness. Had she known Wetherel well enough she would have taken his hand, and held it for a sense of companionship. As it was, she turned to a text: âO God of our salvation, who art the confidence of them that are afar off upon the sea;â these words seemed to walk before her upon the waters. It was one of the verses which her father had asked her to learn by heart before he parted with her. Had she been among her familiar friends, the devout missionaries with whom she had passed her youth, she would have repeated it aloud. Even now the sentence seemed to wrestle at her lips; but glancing furtively at Wetherel's face, she said to herself, âHe might think it very strange;â for gentle and sympathetic as he had been to her, she did not yet feel certain that he could share all her ideas; and, indeed, well might she doubt it. Of a sudden she turned her face toward the waters. Wetherel leaned forward ever so little, and saw a single tear upon her cheek. As much moved by it as if it had been the only tear ever shed in the world, he said in a burst of pity, âYou are very lonely.â âYes, I am,â she murmured, still trying to hide her face. The confession hurt him; then he was nothing to her; his presence was no consolation! But of course there was nothing to be done about it, and while he was still looking blank and feeling uncomfortable and finding nothing to say, the girl unexpectedly recovered her self-possession as women will, and looked up at him with a peculiarly arch, childlike smile, which was characteristic of some of her moods, and which had already delighted him many times. âIf it would relieve your mind to call me a baby, you may do so,â she said. âI don't think you are a baby at all,â he protested. âWhy, what a great distance you have travelled, and almost alone!â âA baby might go as far in a baby-wagon, if its nurse would only push it. I couldn't very well help myself. I was put on a mule, and a screaming mountaineer drove it; and then I was put into a steamer, and other men drove that. Oh, the journey has come easily enough; one day followed another. You are never called on to do on Monday the work that is allotted to Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, and so on. And so it will be, I suppose, throughout life and with other things as well as journeys.â âYou are as brave as a lion,â he laughed approvingly, at the same time thinking what a cheerful little wife she would make, and how well she would bear his troubles for him. âBut what do you mean to do throughout life?â âAnd you?â she asked, her arch smile sparkling up once more, like a sunny bubble rising to the surface of a fountain. âI?â he repeated somewhat discomfited, for his existence hitherto had been idle and his future was aimless. âReally, I hardly know.â âThen how can I know what I shall do?â she answered more pensively. âA woman has so little strength that she can hardly have plans; isn't that so? And yet, although you will perhaps laugh at me when I tell you of it, I do venture to harbor some aims and aspirations. I want to do what work I can and what good I can.â âOh, don't!â he protested. âPeople who live to do good are generally awfully irksome.â âI am sorry you think so,â she replied, looking him full in the face with an air of grave surprise and disappointment. âIt has not been my experience.â Then, thinking no doubt that her tone had been too monitorial, she threw out a meek olive-branch of a smile and added, âI wish you could meet my father. You would see one man who lives to do good, and who is charming.â âI should feel honored to meet him,â bowed Wetherel, anxious to recover lost ground in her esteem. âYou must excuse what I said just now. I was thinking perhaps of people who merely talk of living for the benefit of others, and stop there.â âParrots who say Pretty Polly, and never do anything pretty,â she laughed, evidently pleased to hear him right himself. Now this was cheerful conversation, and Mr. Edward Wetherel could not of course help finding it pleasant, and yet his soul was not entirely satisfied with it. He was more sentimentally content with the girl when she was sad, because then he could imagine himself as gathering her into his philanthropie bosom and cherishing her with consolation. So he reverted once more to her condition of isolation and loneliness. âYou have, I am afraid, very few friends in America.â âVery few,â she admitted, with the cheerful little nod of a canary, and in fact with far less of depression than he had longed to see. âBut the few are very good. I shall be with some of them to-night. I wonder if you ever heard of themâa Mrs. Dinneford and her daughter Alice.â âA Mrs. Dinneford and her daughter Alice are my relatives,â he answered, surprised rather than gratified. âAre they?â said Nestoria, obviously delighted. âI was with them often in London. You know I stopped almost six months in London with an English ladyâa lady who knew about my father and who is very kind to missionary people. Her brother brought me on from Erzeroum; he is a great antiquarian and made wonderful discoveries in Babylon; but I told you all that on the Arabia. At this lady's house I met Mrs. Dinneford and Alice. Isn't Alice pleasant, and isn't her mother good? They asked me to visit them in America, and when I reached New York I found a letter for me. Oh, you can't imagine how it cheered me. I felt like Paul when he met the brethren at the Three Taverns. They are at Savin Rock, near New Haven.â âAt the house of a Mr. Wetherel?â asked the young man coldly. âYes,â she said, her smile dancing out gayly, like a fairy leaping from a rose. âYour name!â He pondered a moment, and then observed gravely, âI cannot call on you there.â She did not reply; it was clearly a momentous piece of information; and her gaze of inquiry showed even more regret than surprise. âNo,â he went on, biting his moustache. âMr. Jabez Wetherel is my uncie; and I am sorry, very sorry to say it, but we are not on good terms.â âI am sorry too,â she murmured; what else could such a child say? âStill, I will try to see you, if you permit it,â he continued. âI venture to hope that I shall be able to meet you again somewhere.â âI shall be pleased,â was her answer. Then she said no more on the sub ject, being not quite sure that she had not done wrong in saying even so much; for the fact of a family quarrel was a terribly ugly one to her mind, throwing doubtful shadows upon the people who were engaged in it, and rendering her pathway among them intricate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A FRIENDLY WELCOME. The Elm City, although freighted with a possible hero and heroine, reached New Haven without misadventure. As it zigzagged up the shallow harbor Wetherel pointed out to Nestoria the country-seat of his uncle, a low, wide-spreading wooden house, with pillared veranda and pointed gables, nested on a little rocky bluff which rose some thirty feet above the yellow beach. The girl looked at it in silence and with a slight sense of aversion, for which she conscientiously reproved herself. The dwelling did not seem to her heartily hospitable, because this very kind and sweet-mannered young gentleman might not enter it. Notwithstanding her keen sense of loneliness in America, and the pleasure with which she had but lately looked forward to meeting her friends, the dear, good Dinnefords, she would have been not unwilling to pass the night at a hotel. âIt is a long way from the city,â she said, with a suppressed sigh which meant, âPerhaps we shall not meet again.â âYes, four miles,â he replied. âIf you will allow me, I will drive out there with you; that is, if my uncle has not sent a carriage for you.â âI expect one,â she sighed again, half hoping that it might not arrive. âAlice telegraphed me that she would be on the dock. She would have come to New York for me, only I wouldn't let her. I hate to have people take trouble about me.â âYou shouldn't,â he declared. âYou are worth taking trouble for.â He looked down in admiration at the sweet innocent face which was turned up towards his in wonder at his flattering speech. It was a constant marvel to him that she should not be aware of her own fascinations and use them to command service. A dandy, a mere worldling, a spoiled child of flattery, he had not a suspicion of the education of humility and self-abnegation which she had received. He had serious-minded relations, it is true, but he had avoided them as far as possible, and in his aversion given their characters no intelligent study, so that he had grown up in a sort of heathenish ignorance of the workings and ways of devout souls. He could not have guessed that any one, not even a piously faithful father, not even a clergyman and missionary, would say daily to such an endearing little beauty as this, âWe are dust and ashes; we are worthless worms of the earth; we have no manner of merit of our own; we live from day to day by sufferance; our sole honor is humility, our sole hope is mercy.â Even had he divined the fact of such lessons, he could not have believed that she would take them seriously to heart and learn from them to hold herself in little esteem. That she was not vain or self-conscious he had discovered; but he attributed it to natural modesty, and gave her all the glory. The touch of the steamer against the wooden sides of the Belle Dock brought Alice Dinneford upon the scene, as the rubbing of a lamp or other talisman in the âArabian Nightsâ calls in a friendly genii. The moment the gangway plank was laid, this impulsive young lady bounded across it, rustled vehemently through the throng of disembarking passengers, and gathered her guest into her cordial arms. A tall brunette, with flashing eyes and an assured manner, she was a striking contrast to the blonde and childlike Nestoria, the two forming some such a bouquet as a pink and a lily of the valley. In a few minutes the waif from the Kurdish mountains found herself in Jabez Wetherel's ancient rockaway, driving soberly among the rectangles of New Haven. She had not bidden good-by to Edward Wetherel; he had disappeared during the confusion of the landing. It seemed to Nestoria that he must have avoided Alice intentionally, and the suspieion was sad enough to throw a chill over even her meeting with a dear friend. It was so strange and dreadful that cousins should not speak, especially when they were both such good and charming people! During the whole drive Nestoria thought of this ugly avoidance; and it was because of it she did not mention Edward Wetherel's name. âSo here you are at last!â prattled the lively Alice. âI am so glad to get hold of you. Why didn't you let me come down to New York after you? You are such a little speck of a thing that you mustn't go wandering alone in this way. You might get lost out of a sail-boat, out of a basket, out of a thimble, and nobody notice it.â âI came across the ocean with only an old lady,â said Nestoria. âI know how to cling fast to somebody or other.â She had hold of Alice's dress at that very moment. It was a charming little trick of hers, indicative of her clinging, confiding nature, thus to lay an infantile, tendril-like clasp upon the garments of her friends. On the Elm City there had been a minute when she could hardly refrain from slyly taking the skirt of Edward Wetherel's coat between her thumb and finger in order to enjoy that precious luxury of hers, the sense of attaching herself closely to a protector. âBesides,â she added, âmy father doesn't like to have me be a charge to people.â âA charge to people! You!â laughed Alice. âWait till people find fault about it. What Turkish ideas your father has. He has forgotten what a young lady passes for in America. Don't you know that we are the salt of the earth here?â âOh, no!â protested Nestoria, who was accustomed to hear that phrase used in a very solemn sense. âThe cream of the cream, then,â varied Alice, with a glimpse of her friend's sensitiveness as to the perversion of Scriptural language. âIt depends upon how we behave,â seriously replied Nestoria. She remembered at the moment a sermon of her father's to his oriental flock, in which he had said, âMen and women are precisely equal in the sight of their Creator; they are both of value merely because the cross was uplifted for both; merely because both may equally lay hold of divine merey.â âIt depends upon how we look,â insisted Alice. âBut never mind about that now. I must tell you what sort of a life you are to have at Sea Lodge. Sea Lodge is the name of Uncle Wetherel's villa. He wanted to call it Mount Horeb, or Mount Pisgah, or something of that sort. Oh, he is such a queer old gentleman, with such old-fashioned antediluvian notions. One would think that he had just come out of the wanderings of the children of Israel, and had got into the world of our time by mistake. I beat him on the name of the villa. I dated all my letters from Sea Lodge, and I had a signboard put up with Sea Lodge on it, and now everybody calls it Sea Lodge, and he can't help himself. He has given in, however; he found the word lodge just a little bit Biblicalâa lodge in a garden of cucumbers, you know. And that is just about it, for he does garden it away in a most extravagant manner, and we do have an abundance of cucumber vines, and the place isn't an enchanted palace, nor a castle of chivalry, nor anything very scrumptions. Now don't bother your head about the word scrumptions; it just means sumptuous, I suppose. You will like Uncle Wetherel; he will exactly suit your tastes. That is, you will like him if you are not afraid of him. Don't be afraid of him. I am not. And yet some people are, he is such an old Plymouth Rock of a man, with eyes which are as set and glassy as a ghost's. He is almost eighty years old and as thin and bony as an umbrella. There is nothing of him but a frame and a black cloth covering. I sometimes feel as if I should like to pick him up and open him with a slap, and shut him up again and put him in the umbrella stand.â âDon't!â begged Nestoria, irresistibly tempted to laugh, but feeling that it was wrong, for Mr. Wetherel was old and good. How could Alice make such fun of her uncle? âWell, I won't,â answered the irrepressible Alice. âHe shan't be put in the umbrella stand if you don't want it. But he is so queer that one can't help having queer plans and projects for him. Can you imagine what he does when he drives out in his phaeton with mamma or me? Every time he finds little boys swearing he pulls up this old poke of a horse and reproves the little rascals; and if they keep on at it, he gets out and chases them with his horsewhip. Of course he can't run, and of course they scud away from him, and then swear worse than ever. All the small wretches around here know him now, and blaspheme him out of his phaeton as often as they can. I do believe he has increased the profanity of the township enormonsly.â âPerhaps it is not a judicious way of dealing with bad boys,â admitted Nestoria. âDealing!â repeated Alice, laughingly catching hold of her friend and shaking her. âYou dear little primness! did you learn to talk out of the catechism? Oh, you will get along famously with Uncle Wetherel. He will say that you talk the language of Zion. Besides, he is all primed to like you; he is fairly addled about missionary people: the forlorn-hope of godliness, he calls them. Your father is a particular admiration of his. I really believe he puts your father alongside of John Bunyan or Jonathan Edwards.â âDoes he?â murmured Nestoria, with a thrill of filial pride which sent the tears into her eyes. âI wish my father could come home and see the kind people who care for him.â âI wish he could,â replied Alice, divining the girl's emotion with that sympathy which is so quick in woman, and passing an arm around her waist. âWe should spoil him. Well, so much for Uncle Wetherel. He will like you, and you will like him. As for my mother, you know what she is.â âOh, yes,â said Nestoria, with a sigh of satisfactionâthe sigh of a contented infant. Now that she had a little lost out of mind the mysterious troubles of Edward Wetherel, it was a pure pleasure to her to think that she would shortly meet the good, cordial Mrs. Dinneford. âAnd that is all,â continued Alice. âUncle Wetherel is a widower, and has lost all his children. No young people except myself; no beaux and no chance of flirtations; no adventures except driving and sea-bathing. We two women take care of Uncle Wetherel; that is our life. I wish we could have a picnic, or give a dinner now and then. But we mustn't; it costs money Uncle has a million or so, and he spends less than four thousand a year. It seems to me precious mean; I could spend fifty thousand. But then he gives away fifty thousand.â âHe must be a very noble man,â judged Nestoria. âThe Turks would respect such a man.â âA lesson for me, I suppose,â laughed Alice. âI won't take it; I won't be advised by the Turks; they don't know as much as I do. But of course you must like him. I want you to, for your own sake. I want you to be contented with us. One thing more I must tell you. Don't be scared and get faint at his way of carving and helping. He carves, and gets tired and sits down and rests himself, and then tries it again. Then he shies things at you; he takes a piece of beefsteak on the fork and hits it with his knife, and away it goes; you would think a frog was jumping across the table at you. But he has done it so often that he always hits his mark. It will land on your plate, and not in your lap. You won't have to wear a baby-apron.â After nearly an hour of this prattle, and of such leisurely journeying that Nestoria once looked at the horse to see if it were not a cow, the rockaway pulled up in front of a red glimmer showing through shrubbery, and the girl perceived that she was at the gate of her new home. The thought which came into her mind at the instant was a wondering query as to what might be the real, fundamental character of an old gentleman who could quarrel with his own nephew, and such a gentle, charming, and seemingly altogether admirable nephew as Edward Wetherel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE MASTER OF SEA LODGE. At the gate of Sea Lodge Nestoria was welcomed with little less than boisterous gladness by Mrs. Dinneford. She was a lady of fifty, above the middle height, and of considerable volume, but giving one an idea of solid brawn rather than of fat, and with a vigorous style of action and elocution which betokened strength and robust health. Her features were irregular and boldly marked, but they beamed unmistakably with cheerfulness, good nature, and cordiality, and they disclosed lurking symptoms of what seemed unconscious humor. Her dress was flying; her handkerchief was fluttering to the ground behind her; her spectacles were holding on to the bridge of her nose with an air of desperation; one hand dragged along the âPuritan Recorder,â which she had been reading to Mr. Wetherel; and altogether she had a flurried, windy air, as of a person descending in a parachute. She was the image of headlong hospitality rushing forth to greet a desired guest. The hilarity of welcome in her wide mouth was not so much a smile as a broad laugh, the preliminary of a somewhat clamorous explosion of kindliness. âSo glad to see you!â she almost shouted, as she caught Nestoria on the intricate steps of the old-fashioned vehicle and kissed her to the ground. âYou come to us like a dove out of the ark. One may almost say that you arrive from Mount Ararat. I feel like asking you after the prosperity of Father Noah and his children. What is your last news from your dear good father? We have taken his hand so often through the `Missionary Hearld' that we all feel as if we had shared his labors and seen his face. Come straight in. James will attend to your baggage. Alice, run, tell Cousin Wetherel that it is Miss Bernard. No, never mind; he must know it. How pleased the old gentleman will be to see you under his roof-tree. He has looked forward to your coming as if you were the Queen of Sheba. James, unstrap that trunk and be careful not to drop it, and carry it up stairs immediately, will you? How tired you must be! And how we do come together from the ends of the earth and the islands of the sea! The devious ways of the great deep are lighted up by Providence in a way that is wonderful to our eyes. I was just reading a piece in the `Puritan Recorder' which put me so in mind of you! Bless me, where is that paper? Cousin Wetherel would have a fit if I lost it. Oh, here it is in my hand; I thought it was my handkerchief. Alice, do look for my handkerchief. It is somewhere or other, flying all abroad likeâhow does the hymn go? And so here you are at last, arrived upon us out of mysteries, safe through a thousand perils. Walk in and see Cousin Wetherel. Dear me, there the old gentleman is, coming out to meet you. I don't know whether he looks most like one of the ancient kings of the order of Melchisedek, or like one risen from the dead.â Mrs. Dinneford talked, like her daughter, with the utmost volubility. In her haste and glee she asked question after question without waiting for an answer, and poured out her feelings, her thoughts, and her news in a commingled and ceaseless torrent. Her conversation was the oddest miscellany of commonplace observations, of Biblical allusions, of whimsical comparisons, and occasionally of striking if not absolute poetic fancies. There is no possibility of adequately describing or reporting it. On the front portico of the house, his hair shining like silver under the light of the hall lamp, stood old Mr. Wetherel. He was a man of medium height, but he seemed tall because of his exceeding leanness, and perhaps he would have been tall but for the stoop in his narrow shoulders. His alpaca clothing blew about him in the light evening breeze as if it draped a mere skeleton. His face was a singularly narrow one; the high, hard, shining forehead was narrow; the sunken, dusky temples approached each other; the cheek bones were close together; the jaws had no breadth. Viewed in profile, this face reminded one of those caricatures which artists sometimes figure in the convex of a crescent moon. A strangely projecting brow looked down over a thin, straight nose at a strangely projecting chin. The expression of the countenance was grave even to austerity, but sweetened by a benevolence of that enduring sort which springs from sense of duty, and lighted now and then (if one studied it long enough) by faint glimmers from a humor which an anxious conscience vainly strove to hide under its bushel. Mr. Wetherel did not advance to meet Nestoria. It would undoubtedly have been a task of some little difficulty for him to descend the steps. But as his guest reached his post of audience he put forth a thin, wrinkled hand, grasped her plump and soft one with a hospitable firmness, and, looking searchingly, steadfastly into her face, said in a tremulous, yet clear voice, and with impressive deliberation, âI am gladâand honoredâto receive under my roof the daughter of the greatâand GOODâDoctor Bernardâwhom Heaven bless! If that light among the dark places of the earth had himself come hither, I would have gone forth to meet him, as the brethren of Rome went to meet Paul. Is he well?â This singular speech, so unwordly in diction and feeling, was uttered with a patriarchal simplicity and sincerity of manner. There was no affectation about it, and not the slightest consciousness of cant. The man had so constantly read the Bible, he had so closely identified his sentiments with the faith of the Bible, that whenever he felt strongly his language was naturally Biblical. There were times, indeed, when he talked in Scriptural style with an evident sense of humor. But that was only in his gayer moments; in such moments of hilarity as would have led other men to joke outright; and even during these ebullitions he never smiled. âMy father was well when I last heard,â replied Nestoria. âHis work is not yet finished,â said Judge Wetherel. âWe are stayedâ those of us who are worth stayingâuntil we have wrought our task. Come in.â He wheeled slowly, not pivoting on his heel, but taking little steps in turning, with an obvious care as to keeping his balance, and marched by her side into the house. His gait was much like his utterance; it was deliberate, monotonous, and solemn. Even among the calm people of the East Nestoria had never seen any human being of such gravity and staidness. A less reverential imagination than hers might have amused itself with the idea that the old gentleman went by clockwork, and was wound up to walk, speak, and think just so fast and no faster. A circumstance, by the way, which added much to his air of stiffness, was a high, old-fashioned black stock, which completely hid his emaciated neck, and seemed to be the only support of his head. This head he turned rarely to right or left, frequently addressing people without looking at them, or bringing himself to face them by slowly wheeling his whole body, as if he were a battalion changing front to open fire. It was with his eyes set straight before him that he carried on a conversation with Nestoria as he escorted her into his parlor. âMiss Bernard,â he continued, in his deliberate monotone, advancing slowly and with frequent halts, like an army under a cautious general, âif I were an Oriental, I suppose I should say to you that this house and all that is in it are yours. As I am an Occidental and a descendant of the exact-speaking Puritans, and therefore have learned to utter strictly what I mean, I will simply say that you are welcome to stay in this house as long as I live.â âI trust that that would mean for a long time,â replied Nestoria with honest warmth. âThat is speaking like an Oriental,â gravely remarked Judge Wetherel. âWhat kindness the easterns feel they also feel at liberty to utter.â âI am so really and deeply obliged to you for your invitation!â added the girl. âI shall want to stay with you a long while.â âWith the permission of Divine Providence you shall,â declared the old man. âThe child of God's apostle to his ancient church in the Kurdish mountains shall be a member of my family as long as she chooses to be.â âBut I must not stay here a very great while,â said Nestoria. âMy father told me that I must not live an idle life in America. I have studies to complete.â âWhatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might,â repeated the Judge. âBut until the hour of labor comes, repose here.â They had now reached a small and plainly furnished but profusely lighted parlor. The old gentleman slightly moved a large chair, signed to the girl to occupy it, seated himself with careful deliberation in another, leaned forward, and gazed at her intently. âDo you look like your father?â he asked, after a pause. âI do not,â said Nestoria. âMy father says that I look as my mother did at my age.â âI wish that you resembled your father,â was the response of the Judge, who seemed a little disappointed. âWhy, Cousin Wetherel, what do you mean?â burst in Mrs. Dinneford, who had just bustled into the room, having been engaged in worrying James about the trunk. âDon't you think she looks well enough? How could anybody want her to be different?â Cousin Wetherel saw, as clearly as Mrs. Dinneford did, that the damsel, as he would have phrased it, was comely. But he would sooner have been smitten on the mouth than have permitted himself to tell her of the fact. In his belief beauty was a snare, and the consciousness of the possession it ruin. Without moving his head he turned his eyes upon his relative with an air of reproof and quietly answered, âShe is as God made her, and it is enough. I was merely anxious to know somewhat concerning the physical appearance of her father.â âWell, so am I,â cheerfully declared Mrs. Dinneford, not in the least abashed or hurt by her reprimand, and in fact too busy with her own thinkings to notice it. âIt is a great satisfaction certainly to become acquainted with the outward man and similitude of good people who have been blessed to do a great work in the world. I should like to know the appearance of Moses and Samuel and Isaiah, and the rest of the old worthies. They must have been delightful to look upon, each after his fashion. You know what Tupper says, `There is a beauty of the spiritâmind in its perfect flowering.' I quote Tupper just as much as ever, Miss Bernard. Cousin Wetherel sometimes reproves me for it; he says I seem to put Tupper above the Bible; and indeed, I don't put him far behind. Tupper is so elevated and philosophical, and such a painter of character! Just hear this now: `There is a beauty of the reason, grandly independent of externals; it looketh from the windows of the house, shining in the man triumphant.' Don't you seem to see St. Paul in that? He was little of stature and of mean countenance, but his great mind must have made him impressive and a feast to the eye. Oh, yes, there is a prodigious satisfaction to be got out of a portrait of somebody whom you reverence. Why, I have studied with a great deal of pleasure the picture of old Peter in the `Lives of the Popes'; I don't suppose it resembles him any more than it resembles Methusaleh or the Patriarch of Constantinople or the Wandering Jew. But I could imagine it was Peter saying, `Lord, thou knowest that I love thee,' though he had more of an air as if he had just been denying his Master. And so, as to your good father, I feel exactly as the Judge does; I should like to see his photograph. Haven't you got one with you?â âNo,â said Nestoria. âI wish I had. But they don't take photographs yet in our mountains. However, he is a little likeâonly he is much olderâa little likeââ and here Nestoria came to a pause. âLike whom?â queried Judge Wetherel with interest. The girl thought that she had gone too far to stop, and she was too conscientious to conceive of an evasion. âLike a gentleman who came up with me in the boat,â she added, coloring deeply. âHe said he was your nephew. Mr. Edward Wetherel.â The old man's countenance darkened a little, and it seemed as if his sunken eyes sparkled. Any one who knew him well might have divined that he was not pleased with the fact of this acquaintance, and that he was likely to question the girl further about it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE JUDGE'S MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. THE catechism concerning Edward Wetherel did not come hastily. The old Judge, following up the matter in his own deliberate fashion, as if to give himself time for meditation and prayer over it, did not speak of the young man to Nestoria for a day or two. Perhaps his intent was that she should learn to look upon him as a friend before she was summoned to accept him as a mentor. A dietatorial soul by nature, and capable of being very grimly authoritative under a consciousness of duty, so that he was an absolute terror to all evil-doers whom circumstances placed under his thumb, he had at the same time a most mellow streak of considerate, old-fashioned courtesy in him, and knew how to be gentleness itself with the gentle. âA Christian,â he was accustomed to say, âought to be the most perfect gentleman on earth;â and in his secret heart he could not help feeling that this rule was especially binding on Wetherels. All his ancestors, as far back as the days of the Mayflower, had been not only Puritans, but Puritans of good social position and of high breeding. In spite of his earnest yearnings after a humble spirit, he was proud of his descent from such men; and because of this pride he considered himself bound to emulate their graces and virtues. Furthermore, his judicial mind, partly the gift of nature and partly the result of a long habit of examining both sides of weighty questions, enabled or rather forced him to be deliberate, considerate, and delicate even in matters which concerned his strong prejudices. Thus for two days the missionary's daughter had an opportunity to study in perfect peace the ordinary life of this household. Had she belonged to the class of persons whom Judge Wetherel stigmatized as worldlings (looking upon them as more guilty and pitiable than the outright heathen), she would have found that life either dismally irksome or whimsically amusing. When she went to bed she discovered on her dressing table a little congregation of the publications of the American Tract Society, with a Bible officiating as clergyman, and a hymn-book as chorister; and a tour of inspection through the house would have revealed the fact that every other dressing-table, gentle or simple, was provided with a similar library; so that, if devotional books have any soporific gift, the Judge's retainers and guests had no excuse for lying awake. Indeed, Edward Wetherel was accustomed to say in his light and fabulous manner that he could not lodge at his uncle's without catching cold, because these composing volumes always caused him to snooze off in his chair and pass the night without sufficient covering. At half-past six in the morning, as virtuously brisk and punctual as the early bird that catches the worm, a servant maid skipped through the house, and, applying her knuckles to every bedroom door, pecked up the slumberer within. If Alice or her motherâboth dilatory persons, and occasionally averse to dutiesâproffered any remonstrance against the clamor, this maid, by the Judge's express orders, put her mouth to the keyhole and said in a monotonous, official tone, âGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.â An hour later, precisely at half-past seven, the old gentleman entered his parlor, marched with the deliberation and gravity of a procession up to a large Bible which occupied a table by itself, took it deferentially in his meagre arms, seated himself, opened the book upon his knees, wiped his spectacles, and rang a little bell. This bell, by the way, was of bronze; and when Alice once substituted for it a silver one which she had bought with her own money, her grave relative put it aside and called for the plainer instrument; at the same time remarking, with his characteristic solemn humor, that silver was a noble metal and worthy of the New Jerusalem, but brass was good enough to call sinners together. It was expected that at the sound of this bell all the family, including the domestics, should appear immediately. If one lingered, that one was sent for; but meanwhile the Judge showed no annoyance or even impatience; he waited in solemn silence and with an air of abstracted meditation; his sunken, glassy eyes were never lifted from the sacred page. On the advent of the loiterer he invariably said, âThe king's business requires haste,â and then proceeded with his service. To save Nestoria from the chance of this reproof, Mrs. Dinneford went to her room on the first morning of her visit. To her great satisfaction she found the girl dressed and ready. âHow do you do, my dear?â she said, with a kiss. âI hope you slept the sleep of youth and health. You must have been as tired as a little bird when he first tries his wings. Have you looked at this glorious sea this morning? The sun is shining on it like the sun of Austerlitz. It must remind you of your native mountains.â Mrs. Dinneford always had so much to say, and was moved to say it in such a hurry, that she was frequently not a little vague and dislocated in discourse, leaving her connections of thought to be guessed at. The association, for instance, of the Kurdish mountains with Long Island Sound, strikes one as loose. âBut I am so glad you slept,â she ran on. âYoung people, and old people too, for that matter, don't always rest well in a new place. We human creatures are a little like cats; we get along best in our own garrets. And it is even so in matters of religion; many people can't worship God except in their own church; indeed, it's wonderful how many cat Christians there are. As my excellent and wise friend Tupper says, `We are frail, and governed by externals.' But I am so glad now you are all ready. I was a little afraid you might have overslept, in spite of those spirit-rappings that worry us up of mornings. You must know that Cousin Wetherel is very particular about promptness at family prayers; and I just ran up to see that you didn't fail, and made a good impression upon him the first morning. Well, we'll go down now; there's the prayer bell. It's just like a college or a church, isn't it? Dear me, how much bell-metal has had to do with Christianity. I sometimes wonder how the faith would have been spread if bronze had never been invented. As some Frenchman has said, everything has to be advertised, even religion; and though he may not have said it in the most respectful spirit, nevertheless there's some truth in it. The deaf ears of this world have to be assailed in all sorts of ways to make them hear; and bell-ringing is only another kind of crying aloud in the waste places. It is one of the indirect influences that Tupper speaks of; you know he says, `Hints shrewdly strown mightily disturb the spirit.' Well, we shall find Cousin Wetherel all ready for us, with his Bible on his knees. He won't look at you, but don't mind that. He never enters upon the conversation of the day until, as he says, he has invoked Heaven's blessing upon it. Prayer before speech and thanks before food, is one of his mottoes. There is Alice now. Alice, come and speak to Nestoria while you have a chance. You see, child, we don't follow Cousin Wetherel's precepts. We talk at all times, in season and out of season, and sometimes, perhaps, without a blessing upon it; or if there is one, it comes by good luck and no merit of ours. Talking seems to be our mission. It's just as natural to us as rattling to a wagon.â During this speech Nestoria had several times tried in vain to make answer. She had sought to say that she had slept well, that she had admired the sunlight on the sea, that she had thought of her native mountains, and that she thanked Mrs. Dinneford for calling her. But the fluency of the elder lady perpetually submerged her, and she had not been able to get a whole sentence to the surface. She now exchanged a kiss and a little hurried whispering with Alice; and then they were in the parlor in the solemnizing presence of Judge Wetherel. As Mrs. Dinneford had predicted, he did not address his visitor on her entrance, and his glassy eyes remained fixed upon his Bible. The servants, an elderly English coachman, a still more venerable cook of the female gender and American stock, and an Irish Protestant chambermaid of thirty, who had all been respectfully waiting the arrival of their betters, now came in and took seats by the door. Only when perfect silence and quiet had been established did the Judge commence his devotions. Lifting his eyes for the first time in two minutes, he turned them slowly from face to face, and uttered in his tremulous monotone the following words: âMy Christian friends, unworthy as we all are of such mercy, our Creator has permitted us once more to look upon each other, and to join in returning thanks for undeserved blessings. I shall now read a portion of this Holy Word which was revealed to us as a guide whereby we might reach a better and happier life. If wisdom seems to be given me, I will endeavor to speak a word or two of interpretation; and if I seem to you to pass any dark places without proper note, I pray that you will deliver your minds therenpon, and if you cannot shed light at least shed darkness; for the exhibition of darkness may lead to a correction of light.â He then read, very slowly, the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, pausing occasionally to utter brief comments, some of the ordinary type of Biblical exegesis, and others of an originality which bordered on humor. But whatever his thoughts might have been, his countenance remained grave; not even a comic incident could ruffle the icy surface of its solemnity. After he had read of the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., he paused over the inquiry, âAnd what shall I more say?â Here the elderly cook, who took it that this was a question of Judge Wetherel's own asking, and that he was hard bested to answer it, came to his relief. âSay?â she repeated in a prompt, confident treble; âwhy, say they were good men and ought to go to heaven.â âSarah,â tranquilly remarked the old man, âthere is a wisdom which is profitable.â and continued his reading. Sarah, obtusely conscious of approval, glanced cheerfully at her juniors in domestic travail, and then, curbing her spiritual pride, bent her loose eyes upon the floor. A sparkle of amusement danced under Mrs. Dinneford's lashes, and the rattleheaded Alice barely prevented a smile. Nestoria, educated in habits of the profoundest respect for devotional matters, exhibited not the slightest change of countenance. Nor was she at all diverted when a sportive kitten mounted the Judge's back while he was on his knees, and played with the silver locks which hung over his high coat collar. The old gentleman, too, was equally indifferent to the feline disturbance; he touched upon all his customary âtopicsâ with his customary deliberation. At last the service ended; the Judge rose with effort to his feet; and now he allowed himself to salute his guest. âMiss Bernard,â he said, walking composedly up to her and taking one of her hands in both his, âI am rejoiced to see you at my altar and by my hearth. Let me trust that the daughter of that servant of God, Doctor Bernard, will make herself at home in a family which fervently admires her father. I will not say this again. I am sure it will not be necessary.â âI am glad to hear family prayers once more,â said Nestoria. âOf course I have always been accustomed to them. It puts me at home at once.â There was no tone of cant about this declaration, nor did the girl utter it to please her company. She spoke with the utmost naturalness, and with unpremeditated sincerity. It had seemed to her while listening to the Judge's patition that she was once more in her childhood's home, and the power of reminiscence that there is in familiar words and feelings had deeply moved an affectionate, lonely heart. Mr. Wetherel showed no sign of emotion in his wrinkled, imperturbable countenance, but he walked slowly over to Mrs. Dinneford and whispered in her ear, âShe will find herself at home in Paradise.â The utterance was so sublimely unworldly, and its enthusiasm was such a matter of surprise as coming from the grave Judge, that for a moment Mrs. Dinneford's soul was loftily shaken, and she could have found kindly pleasure in crying. âUncle Wetherel, did you feel the cat on your back at prayers?â put in the jovial Alice. âI would give a sixpence to know what you thought.â âI was reminded to pray specially against the temptations of Satan,â answered the old man. âNot that the cat can be a satanic incarnation, as our worthy ancestors were suffered to believe. But wanderings of mind in devotion, resulting from no matter what cause, are diabolic. We must resist them.â Having dropped this insidious reproof, which Alice, by the way, took no profitable note of, he proceeded to breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE CONVERSE OF TWO YOUNG LADIES; OR, A WISE AND FOOLISH VIRGIN. After a long grace, uttered in a standing posture, the Judge fell to his carving. He stood up to this duty also, for in a sitting position he would have been no match for the broiled chicken, and even with the aid of avoirdupois his trembling hands did their work slowly. Now and then an involuntary grimace indicated his physical weakness, or perhaps betrayed some dolor of old age. Over one tough joint he paused for some time, meanwhile talking composedly, knife and fork in hand. His subject was the missionary work in general, and that of Doctor Bernard in particular. âThe goings and comings of the truth on this dark earth are wonderful,â he observed. âThe revolutions of the light of the soul are like the revolutions of day and night. When our savage ancestors were still worshipping Thor and Odin, the Nestorians had long since been keepers of the faith. And now we, having received it into our Anglo-Saxon minds from the East, are permitted and commissioned to carry it back to the East. But what can you tell me of the Kurds? Are they the descendants of the ancient Carduchians?â âMy father thinks so, and I believe every one in the mission does,â replied Nestoria, as composed as the sublime old gentleman himself, and not once glancing at her empty plate, although very hungry. âSo,â continued the Judge, âthe same ferocious people who annoyed the retreat of the Ten Thousand have in these days impeded the labors of our saints and massacred their disciples. I am not a man of war, but of peace,â he continued, with something like smothered indignation; âyet am I tempted to wish that the Nestorians had had somewhat of the Greek discipline, and a Christian Xenophon to direct it. However, the Creator knows what is best for his Church. It becomes us to wait his labor in reverent silence.â Having reposed himself during this dialogue, Mr. Wetherel resumed his attack upon the broiled chicken, treating it with some such severe vigor as if it represented a Kurd, and by dint of much âbearing onâ eventually getting the better of it. Other ecentricities, even more notable than his manner of carving, were forthcoming. Like many elderly persons, he had dropped some of the prandial courtesies of his prime and returned to the simpler manners of his childhood. He preferred to help his guests directly, rather than tarry for the slow plate-bearing of the waiter girl, who, by the way, was the chambermaid. Once he accomplished the difficult feat attributed to him by Alice, namely âskippingâ a bit of chicken across the table from his carving-fork and lodging it dexterously on Mrs. Dinneford's plate. Another performance consisted in taking a slice of bread in his fingers and tossing it over his shoulder into the grate. This seemed to be so entirely irrational, unless indeed it were some kind of ceremonial akin to the pouring out of libations, that Nestoria was lost in astonishment. âCousin Wetherel!â laughed Mrs. Dinneford. âYou forget that there is no fire.â âMrs. Dinneford, I stand corrected,â replied the Judge with monumental composure. âEllen, carry that piece of bread into the kitchen and toast it.â âTake a fresh slice,â suggested Mrs. Dinneford. âThat isn't fit.â âIt is good enough for an aged sinner who can't remember whether it is summer or winter,â affirmed the Judge. âCousin Wetherel prefers to toast his own bread,â explained Mrs. Dinneford to Nestoria. âHe wants to make sure that it shall be burnt to a coal.â âAt my age a man must how to his stomach,â added the old gentleman. âHe must say humbly to that organ, What will your highness please to digest? It is a hard and low master. I serve it while I despise it.â âYou ought to read Tupper on `Hidden Uses,' â remarked Mrs. Dinneford. âHe has some noble thoughts on the value of things which seem to be of no worth.â âWhen I have exhausted Solomon I will turn my attention to Tupper,â answered the Judge with sedate scorn. âWell, do give Nestoria another bit of chicken,â put in Alice. âShe has nothing to eat.â âMiss Bernard, you must pardon my spectacled purblindness,â apologized the descendant of many Wetherels. âI may say that I see you through a glass darkly.â Not only the Judge's ideas and manners, but also his turns of speech, were original. But his obvious sincerity of character, his venerable age, and even his physical feebleness lent a dignity to all his peculiarities, and made him a patriarchal figure. Nestoria was not in the least disposed to laugh at him; she regarded him with a respect which did her honor; for in truth he was worthy of respect. It must be observed in passing that he bore a graver aspect at table than was usual with him. âA meal,â he was accustomed to say, âshould be looked upon as a species of solemn ceremonial, inasmuch as it is a celebration of a fresh grant of undeserved mercies.â Thus when he rose from breakfast it was with a more lightsome face than he had worn hitherto. âNow, Miss Bernard, a duty is over,â he said cheerfully. âHow shall we spend the day?â âI should like to do something for you, sir,â replied Nestoria. âI am sincerely obliged to you for the desire,â bowed the Judge, with the solemn courtesy of a gentleman of the old school. âBut my needs in the way of amusement are few. Let me urge you to think of yourself. You can drive. I have but one horse, and Jehu would not have given a shekel of brass for him, but he answers our purpose. He is usually gracious enough to take out Alice in the morning, and myself with Mrs. Dinneford in the afternoon. Some day, when it is agreeable to you, you can go with me. I should take it as a pleasure.â Of course Nestoria replied that it would also be a pleasure to her; and although the answer was a courtesy, it was not the less uttered in sincerity. Generously sympathetic by nature, and educated in ways of self-abnegation by parents whose life had been a continuous self-sacrifice, she had grown up with a disposition to fill the cup of others rather than her own; so that, however dull a drive with Mr. Wetherel might have seemed to her imagination, she would have found a sort of dutiful satisfaction in driving with him across the continent, had he declared for such a recreation. But, more than that, she really liked the society of elderly persons, for the reason that she was accustomed to it. Infants had not swarmed into the ark of the Nestorian mission; and of the few who had been vouchsafed to it some had died promptly, and others had been sent in good time to America; while with the native youth of the land she had not been allowed to associate freely, for fear of evil communications. Thus nearly all the people whom she had known familiarly during her childhood and girlhood had been many years older than herself, while the gravity of their pursuits and character made them seem even older than they were. We need not wonder therefore that she should look upon the venerable Judge as a suitable comrade, and should be able to say to him honestly that she should like very much to share his phaetonic adventures. I must admit here that such an old-minded young lady seems at first sight to be hardly a taking heroine. The ordinary healthful soul may be pardoned for suspecting that she must have been a little hypocrite or an unnatural little prig. But those who knew her ways best and were allowed to see deepest into her heart did not think her either. There was not a bit of affectation or of any manner of pretence in her demeanor or in her character. She was as natural as a bird; and all you could say against her was that she had been brought up in a cage instead of the wildwood freedom of a nest; and even if you chose to add that it was a pity, you had to concede that she was not to blame. It would have been dreadful, to be sure, if her convent-like education had crushed out of her those instinctive emotions which form one of the chiefest charms and one of the purest joys of youth; and we must admit that, had that been the case, the girl would not have been attractive. But the events of this story will show that Nestoria was not deficient in feelings, and that she could be led by them to do things which a more worldly-wise young lady might have recoiled from; experience in perils being oftenest the parent of prudence. Returning now to the course of our story, we will state the commonplace, composing fact that Alice and Nestoria drove out together, perambulating such a wide extent of sandy coast country that Old Sorrel twice came to a halt in dumb remonstrance. âGet up!â screamed Alice, twitching at the reins. âI declare I believe he is going to lie down. Such a horse! Uncle ought to have a spanking span, and a fine carriage and a regular coachman. And here he keeps this old fatty, and James hoes potatoes! If I had a million, wouldn't I make it fly! What a breakfast that was! Did you ever see the like?â âA great deal worse,â answered Nestoria. âOh, yes, on missionary ground. But poor breakfasts are quite appropriate there, just to teach the heathen not to be greedy. Rich people at home should spend their money.â âTo teach the missionaries not to be greedy?â asked Nestoria. Alice laughed. âYou are awful clever sometimes,â she confessed. âYou look so demure, and all of a sudden you say something cunning, and it astonishes people. It strikes one as if a rabbit or a chicken had made a joke. However, I wasn't complaining of the quality or quantity of the breakfast; there is enough to eat on uncle's table, and it is generally good enough. I meant the grimness and the queer behaving. I do so hate grimness and queer behaving. Did you see that chicken wing fly? It couldn't have done better if it had been alive and had all its feathers. I expected to hear it cackle cut-out-ca-da-cut. I hate such fashions.â âDon't you think your uncle is a very good man?â asked Nestoria, quietly remonstrating against this light-minded and unfair criticism. âGood? I guess he is. Too good. Think of his giving away fifty thousand a year to charities and Bible societies and that sort of thing. It puts me out of all patience. I would like a five hundred dollar dress, and a five hundred dollar brooch, and a thousand dollar shawl, and so on. But he gives me nothing unless it is now and then some solemn book. He says I have enough money of my own for vanities.â âAnd haven't you?â asked the missionary's daughter, glancing at Alice's coral earrings. The glance, we must explain, was not one of austere reproof, nor of greed, or envy, or jealousy. The girl frankly admired the earrings, taking a heartfelt, natural pleasure in their shapely form and rich color, and simply marvelling that such luxury could feel discontent. âNo,â declared Alice. âWhat girl ever did have enough? Well, I mustn't complain; it is rather ungrateful. I suppose uncle means to leave us a great deal of money.â âAnd won't he leave anything toâ?â Nestoria began the sentence eagerly, but she did not finish it. âTo whom?â stared Alice. âI thought he had a nephew,â said Nestoria, coloring over her speech, but conscientiously bound to be frank. The garrulous Alice turned discreet in presence of the family skeleton, and merely replied, âSo he hasâI don't know.â âWe are lucky,â she presently added, unable to repress entirely her communicative nature. âThe Judge is not my own uncle; he is only mamma's first cousin. But he has taken a great fancy to us. It is one of his whimsies. I am sure I don't know why he should like me, such a piece as I am.â âPerhaps he trusts you will come to resemble your mother,â suggested Nestoria. âThank you,â laughed Alice. âMother is nice enough, and I don't object to being like her, when the time comes.â But we must not spend too much space upon the talk of these girls; we must hasten on to the more momentous drive of Nestoria with the Judge. The old man had proposed the expedition in order that he might be alone with his youthful guest and catechise her as to the extent of her intimacy with his nephew, and perhaps say a word in season concerning so perilous an acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. A FRIENDLY WARNING. It was five o'clock in the afternoon when the Judge and Nestoria set out on their progress through the sandy by ways of the shore. The old man drove in a leisurely fashion, according to his octogenarian custom, talking much to his beast in a remonstrative tone, using the lash rarely and at regular intervals, as if it were a matter of stated duty, and applying it even then in a perfunctory, ceremonial, and not altogether sincere manner. Old Sorrel took his own gait; when admonished, he went a little slower, as if to listen; when whipped, he whisked his tail over the spot, under a pretence of brushing off flies; if he came within reach of a thicket, he made a bite at a tuft of leaves, and left off trotting to munch; if he discovered a hill a quarter of a mile ahead of him, he prepared himself for it by falling into a walk; in short, he showed that he was a dilatory, obstinate, and self-seeking old quadruped. âSorrel is not even a good eye-servant,â remarked the Judge. âHe evades his due labor under my very spectacles.â âHe can go faster,â said Nestoria, remembering how Alice had got the ancient shirk over the ground. âHe can, but why should he?â answered Mr. Wetherel. âWe shall get home to tea, and he knows it. What is time to an old man like me? Hardly more than to an old horse like him. Time, Miss Bernard, is chiefly of value in our youth, when we still have strength to improve it. One of the sorrowfulest things of my present age is the thought that my days are now of less worth than they were to my fellow creatures. The Creator is divinely right in removing the old to make place for the young.â âI wonder if I shall ever work,â queried Nestoria. âMy father,â she added, uttering the word in a charming tone of reverence and belief, âmy father warned me that I should be exposed to one great temptation in America. He said that you good people at home spoil missionaries' children. You pet them and support them, he said, and so make them shamefully lazy. Now, Mr. Wetherel, are you going to spoil me? Don't you know that I ought to be set at work?â âAnd what shall we set you at?â inquired the Judge, who was not in the least inclined to put his shoulder to this duty, and had even dallied with a temptation to dower the girl out of his own riches. âCouldn't I help in a school? I might teach painting, as well as other things. I learned to paint fans from the lady who entertained me in London.â âDo you never mean to go back to your father?â asked the old man, who considered missionary work the noblest labor possible to mortals. âOh, yes, when I am fit for it; but my education isn't completed, you know; and my character isn't formedâso my father says. Yes, I suppose I shall go back in a few years,â she added dreamily, while an unbidden query came into her mind as to whether she would go with a husband, and whether Edward Wetherelâ But here she promptly cheeked her imagination; she must not think so seriously of a man who had said so little to her that was serious; a man, too, who might not be as good as she hoped he was; who might even be what she called âan unbeliever.â âAnd in the mean time you desire to study and also to work,â said the Judge with an approving nod. âVery good. It must all be done. But there is time enough. You must abide under my roof during the vacations. After that we will see.â âYou must be sure to see,â responded Nestoria, with conscientious urgency and woman's dependence. âYou spoke of meeting my nephew Edward,â continued the old gentleman, whose undercurrent of thought had all the time been eddying about that dreadful topic. âHow came you to encounter him?â Nestoria colored brilliantly; it was even a greater subject to her than to her companion; that name of Edward was the only one that had ever made her heart beat. âI met him on the Atlantic steamer,â she answered, just a bit suffocated by the explanation. âIndeed!â exclaimed the Judge, not a little alarmed, for he knew of the young man's pleasant ways with women. âThen you have seen much of him?â âYes,â said Nestoria, happy in the recollection, and smiling back at those pleasant hours. âHe was very, very kind to me. He took me to walk every morning and afternoon in rough weather, and it was always rough, at least a little. I should have been much more lonesome without him.â âI trust you saw nothing in his walk and conversation but what you could approve,â added the old man in a tone of doubt which did not flatter Edward. âNo.â answered Nestoria frankly and firmly. Indeed, she had seen a great deal to approve in the said walk and conversation. Had not the young fellow treated her with perfect politeness, and even with charming consideration and delicacy? Notwithstanding this mysterious quarrel with his good uncle, she found it impossible to believe that he could be very bad, or so much as bad a little. âI suppose he smokes still?â queried the Judge, in a tone which seemed to declare that smoking leads to drinking, and drinking to murder, and murder to the gallows, all three doubtful statements in our day. âYes,â admitted Nestoria. âBut is that wrong? Some of the missionaries smoke.â âThat is possible,â groaned the venerable Puritan, unwillingly conceding the stumbling fact, and seeking to excuse it to himself on the plea of Oriental custom. âBut at all events they don't drink ale.â âThere isn't any ale,â said Nestoria. âHowever, I don't suppose they would drink it if there was any. They are all teetotallers, I believe.â âI trust so,â fervently returned the Judge. Then he thought, in the anti-nicotine corner of his earnest soul, What a pity they should smoke! This reflection, however, he did not utter; he would not lead the girl to question the goodness of her father's comrades in pious labors; he had his strenuous prejudices, but at times he could be wisely considerate in spite of them. By the way, it seems appropriate to relate here a story which illustrates the old man's hatred of tobacco; a hatred so hearty that it could confound his judicial mind and cause him to pronounce judgment without hearing evidence or argument. In a certain grave convocation there had been a question of passing censure upon clerical smokers; whereupon an erring brother of a scientific turn rose to his feet and attempted to demonstrate that, under given circumstances, of habit and constitution, a cigar or so per day would not be injurious, and consequently not immoral; whereupon Judge Wetherel made a reply commencing with these memorable and monumental words, more immovable than a sentence of pyramids: âMr. ModeratorâI thank Heavenâthat on this subjectâ my mind is not open to conviction.â But we must return to his catechism of Nestoria concerning Edward; he was anxious to know how she happened to meet the young man on the Elm City. âIt was just an accident,â she said. âHe was coming up this way to a fishing-place.â âWhat fishing-place?â âHe did not tell me. Are there so many?â The Judge was relieved; then there had been no agreement to meet again; there was to be no correspondence; it was not a flirtation. The dove under his roof, the innocent daughter of the âgreat and goodâ Doctor Bernard, had not become entangled in the talons of that unclean bird of prey, his reprobate nephew. Their companionship had been a mere transitory acquaintance, and there was no need of asking any painfully searching questions about it, nor of entering into monitory disclosures of the young man's character. Mr. Wetherel was glad of it, for, like other wise and decorous men, he hated to talk of the skeleton in his closet; and furthermore, he was conscientious as to bearing needless evil witness, even against the ungodly. As long as there was hope of reforming Edward he had withstood him to his face, as he expressed it in his Biblical way; and when all such hope had died out of his heart he had resolved to disinherit him, and that was enough. He would not, in addition, as perse his name, unless such accusation were needful for the salvation of others. Nestoria put his reticence to the proof. She was anxious to speak of the quarrel, because she longed to put an end to it. At the bottom of her childlike innocence and simplicity there was a solid foundation of moral courage, which was made up partly of conscious rectitude of intention and partly of a beautiful eonfidence in the goodness and kindliness of her fellow creatures. It was not unlike the courage of those untaught birds on the shores of rarely visited islands who walk deliberately up to the feet of marvelling explorers. âHe told me,â she added in a slightly agitated voice, âwhy he did not come to see you in passing. He said you were not on terms with each other.â In spite of the temptation offered by this statement, the old man remained firm to his abjuration of needless evil speaking. âWe have not been able to agree,â he said gravely, and with honest sorrowfulness. âIt is very sad that relatives should take such differing, such diverging paths in life. But we have not been able to agree. May He who is all-wise and all-pitiful have mercy upon him who is in the wrong, be it Edward or myself!â He said no more; the door to this subject was evidently shut upon her. She had transmitted the young man's apology for passing his relatives by; it was all that she had a right to do. Thus it came about that Nestoria was left to live on in ignorance of the nature of this quarrel, and even in uncertainty as to which of the two parties to it was in the wrong. Both of them seemed to her altogether lovely in character, and incapable of truly meriting the other's condemnation. Educated in a little dovecote of piety, far withdrawn from the great world of fashion and dissipation, and unaccustomed to see any bad people except such as wore turbans and carried pistols in their sashes, she knew nothing of wild young men except by insufficient report, and had no manner of skill in detecting them. She thought that of course they carried the marks of their wickedness in their persons and faces; that their hands were tremulous, their countenances haggard, and their eyes sunken; that their expressions were hideous with evil passions and with the torments of remorse. Now no such shocking stigmata were visible in Edward Wetherel; his form was vigorous, his skin healthfully clear, his look cultured and gentle. Evil had not set its well-known brand upon him, and therefore in her opinion he could not be the child of evil. The quarrel was a mystery; perhaps it was about some matter of business, inexplicable to women; perhaps both Edward and his uncle were in some incomprehensible way right. She could not solve the disagreeable puzzle, and for the present she left it in the hands of Providence, trusting that the day of unravelment would come. âYou will find our life very quiet here,â said the Judge as they drove homeward. And so she did, at least for a time. There was not another country residence within miles of Sea Lodge. A so-called hotel stood near by, indeed, but its inmates and visitors were mainly persons of the ruder if not lewder sort, and they no more frequented the Judge's house than Canaanites of old infested the schools of the prophets. In the neighboring city the family had few acquaintances, and those few rarely drove out to render it visits. Sometimes hack loads of singing or yelling revellers clattered by of nights, inciting Mr. Wetherel to repeat Milton's verse concerning âThe noisy sons of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.â But in general Sea Lodge was a refuge of quiet, hearing no clamor but the thump of waves on the beach, and certainly producing no uproar of its own. Nevertheless, Satan was prowling about, as the Judge frequently asserted; and, such being the case, disturbances and evil adventures could not long be kept at bay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE JOYS AND SNARES OF MOONLIGHT. âDid you ever see such a dull place!â demanded the sociable Alice, quite ready, we fear, to let Satan into Sea Lodge rather than bear with its dulness. âAlice, I am perfectly happy,â answered Nestoria. âThat is, almost,â she added, recollecting certain absent ones whose presence would have made the happiness perfect. âI find every day too short. I hate to go to sleep.â âWell, if you are not joyful on the very smallest provocation! What in the world are you happy for? Because we never do anything? Because we never see anybody? Because we are shut up in an enchanted castle, with Uncle Wetherel for a magician?â âBut we do do something. I have read half of Robinson's `Syria' to your uncle. I have written twenty pages to my father. We have driven and sailed and walked. I could look all day at the sea, it is so beautiful and mysterious. How can you find it dull! You ought to live in a Nestorian village for a few years. It would teach you what sameness is.â âWhy, my dear little canary bird, I do believe you are scolding,â laughed Alice. âScolding?â asked Nestoria âAt any rate you lectured. It was borne in upon me that I repine without cause. You certainly lectured.â âDid I? I mustn't. I am not fit.â âOh, don't be so humble! And do, please, don't be so reprovingly con-tented. You wouldn't be, perhaps, if you had seen as much of the world as I have, and knew by experience how much livelier places there are in it than Sea Lodge. What I am crazy for is Newport.â âWhat is Newport?â inquired Nestoria. âWhat is Newport?â repeated Alice. âOh, of course you don't know. Well, Newport is the principal seaport ofâof Mount Pisgah.â Nestoria perceived that Alice was laughing at her, and a blush of dismay and distress danced into her cheeks, so sensitive can a young person be who grows up in Nestorian hamlets, surrounded by grave, considerate, kindly people. âReally, you ought to be shown Newport,â continued Alice. âIf uncle wasn't shamefully meanââ âDon't!â pleaded Nestoria, forgetting her sense of humiliation in her desire to defend the excellent Judge. âI mean if he wasn't dreadfully good and conscientious, and so forth, he would take us there. We should see some living life, and we should pick up beaux. They are a deal finer than cockle shells. They are the most interesting of objects by the seaside. And there is one particular beau of mine whom I should dearly like to meet again for the fun of laughing at his oddities. Men are always more entertaining than women; they are so much more untrammelled, and do so much queerer things, and have so much more character; but this special man is as diverting as a cage full of monkeys. He is a Pole, so he says, and a count also, so he says, and I never heard anybody say to the contrary, and it may be so. But at any rate he is a gentleman, and handsome, and pretends to be very learned, and as polite as a pickpocket, as I heard somebody put it; and oh, so devoted, such compliments, such nonsense' I could listen to him forever, only it might kill me with laughing. Count Poloski. It's quite a distinguished name, isn't it? And he is a great favorite, I can tell you; and the attentions he paid me set more than one other girl on a pincushion; and of course that made the fun all the greater. Oh yes, what with the Count and lots more not so very much wiser, and a few who are really fascinating and irresistible, Newport is a delightful sort of Vanity Fair, and well worth showing to you.â Nestoria made no response. Either Alice's description of the charms of Newport did not present a temptation to her mind, or she thought it wrong to discourse of such temptations. âThis evening we will get up our own Newport,â continued Miss Dinneford. âWe will walk alone and in silence on the beach, and view the moonlight.â âI wish you would,â answered Nestoria, who honestly thought this simple treat delightful. âYou don't mean it!â echoed the worldling of twenty, in mockery. âWell, reckless as the dissipation may be, we will plunge into it. But what would your father say?â âI don't see why he should object,â wondered the innocent from the dovecote in Kurdistan. âNor I either, on second thoughts,â laughed Alice, âWe may meet a few oysters, but they are deaf and dumb, you know; they won't even make signs to us. And even if they do, I hope we shall be above flirting with mollusksâ âAre they mollusks?â queried Nestoria. âOh dear, how little I know about this wonderful world that I live in! I must recommence my studies.â âLet them go at mollusks,â advised Alice. âI am sure I don't know whether they are or not, and don't care. I am sorry I used the horrid word, since it has waked up your worrisome conscience. What do you have such a conscience for? It must be very inconvenient.â âAlice, I should be afraid of you if I thought you meant half you say,â gravely observed Nestoria. âOh, I don't; I don't mean a quarter of it.â affirmed Alice. âI mainly mean to talk. When I can't find any human being to listen to me, I talk to the cat; and didn't I get a lecture on the subject one day from Uncle Wetherel! `Alice,' said he, `conversation addressed to a dumb beast must be considered as idle conversation, and as such we shall be called to account for it.' Now do you believe that the recording angel takes down what I say to a pussy cat? If so, he must take down what Uncle Wetherel says to Old Sorrel. But I don't believe it. I don't believe that angels attend to any such small business.â âAlice, I wish you wouldn't speak of such subjects soâgayly,â murmured Nestoria. âYou fill me with astonishment and perplexity.â âPoor little dove!â said Alice. âHow could they send you out of the ark?â As the girls prepared to take their walk in the evening Mrs. Dinneford asked where they were going. âNantucket, Cape Cod, and all along shore,â answered her daughter. âIf we don't come back, inquire at Marblehead.â âDon't expose yourselves too long to the night air,â counselled the elder woman, who, like many elder women, was much given to medical precepts. âThe moonlight is not healthful.â âThe moonlight is healthful, begging your pardon, Mrs. Dinneford,â interposed the Judge. âThe moonlight is but the reflection of the life-giving sunlight. It is the dampness of the night air which is not healthful.â âI was always brought up to believe that it was the moonlight which did the harm,â persisted good Mrs. Dinneford, a kind soul not without obstinacy. âWhen our bringing up is contrary to the truth, we must abjure it, as we would abjure and renounce our original sinfulness,â lectured the old gentleman. âI have the greatest mind to walk out with you, children,â said Mrs. Dinneford. âIf you'll wait just a minute till I find my hat and shawlââ âOh, mamma, don't!â protested Alice. âYou know you never will find your hat and shawl. And besides we want to take a romantic walk and fill our tranquil souls with meditation, and if you go with us you will spoil all that by talking a steady stream and quoting Tupper.â âWell, go along,â laughed the mother. âBut do be careful, and if you meet any strangers turn back, for there are too many wild people about here of nights.â âWithout are dogs,â quoted the Judge. So the two girls went unattended down to the beach and strolled along its enchauted meanderings. The ripples of a brimming tide joyously patted the sands at their feet, and a varying moonlight descended upon them through the shifting mountains of cloudland. The harbor, a sheet of sombre azure chased with sparkling silver, swept out into the broad expanse, here obscure and there effulgent, of the Sound. Miles away a light-house beamed luridly âlike a star on eternity's ocean.â A single sail, undoubtedly that of a pleasure boat, now gleaming like polished marble and now darkening into a misty ghost, was the only moving object in the exquisite picture. For nearly half an hour the pair wandered; the lively Alice chattering gayly, or throwing pebbles into the water, or whirling on her heel to make marks in the sand; while the quieter Nestoria listened, smiled, and loitered, half lost in waking dreams. âI would like to stay here till morning,â murmured the waif from the arid Orient. âThis world of waters is something so new to me, and so inexhaustibly wonderful, that it bewitches me.â âSo would I like to make a night of it, if there were only dancing,â answered the representative of New York society. âOh, don't I hate quiet, and don't I love company! I was made to buzz and hum through life like a fly, always looking for a swarm of other flies. Uncle Wetherel compares me to a hornbug; you know what headlong, noisy things they are, and how they blunder about; buzz, bang, and down they come on their backs and kick dreadfully; and then up again, to knock their heads against some other corner and get another great fall, like Humpty Dumpty. It's an odious comparison, and I don't assent to it altogether; and yet I must admit that there is something a little like, for I do have a great many adventures, and bounce out of them safely.â âThat sail boat is coming to land,â observed Nestoria. âOught we not to go back?â âGo back? No. There are sail boats spinning up and down the harbor every evening, just for the sake of spinning up and down and enjoying the motion. You might as well be afraid of gulls. The one lands as often as the other.â âBut it is close under that rocky point,â declared Nestoria. âThey could disembark there without our seeing them.â âOh, boats frequently sail under the bluff and then sweep on into the cove beyond. And they come very near the shore, too; we might perhaps hail them. Would you mind hailing them and then running away? There is just a possible small chance that some of our New Haven friends might be in the boat. You won't? Oh, Nestoria, you are a regular drag and drawback to fun, and more prudent and shy than my mother. You stay here while I climb up the rocks and look over to see who they are. It is only a few rods. Will you?â âYes,â conceded Nestoria. âBut don't be gone long, and do be prudent.â âIf they are strangers, I will come directly back,â promised Alice. She hurried away on her frolicking reconnoissance, and clambered the little rocky bluff with a beating heart but with a soul prepared for audacious ventures. Reaching the seaside brow of the knoll, she looked down upon the boat, discovered that it had drawn close up to the shore as if the men in it proposed to land, and was about to slip back and return to Nestoria, when she heard herself called by name. âWho is it?â she asked in a voice of gleeful excitement. âEdward Wetherel; and Count Poloski is with me.â âOh, Cousin Edward!â exclaimed Alice. She hesitated an instant and then added, âCome up here, Edward. And the Count may come, too.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX A WRONG-HEADED HERO. Before we divulge what Edward Wetherel had to say to his cousin and her friend, we must go back a little in his history and see how he had brought about this interview, or rather how he had been led on to it. He had parted from Nestoria on the Elm City, as we remember, without bidding her good-by; and we will add that he had left her thus because when he went to say his last word he found her already in the arms of Alice Dinneford; and with the Dinnefords, his lucky rivals in the good-will of his uncle, it was not possible for him to be cordial on instant notice. Now Edward was a wilful, self-seeking, pleasure-loving youngster. He liked his own way, and he was greedy after agreeable emotions, and he took disappointments very unkindly. It annoyed him to lose the farewell scene which he had meant to have with Nestoria; to be cheated out of a final pressure of her soft hand and an investigating gaze into her blue eyes; to be gagged, as it were, just as he was about to utter some sweet word which should compel her not to forget him. Moreover, the mere sight of Alice was disheartening and vexations, reminding him as it did of that inconvenient quarrel with the Judge, which had been so hard on his feelings, and which threatened to be ruinous to his purse. In a bitter mood he took a hack with his friend Wolverton and drove to the New Haven House, very sadly disposed to call for wine or other mightier drinks and make what he called a night of it. They obtained adjoining rooms, and Wetherel presently threw the connecting door open, being much in need of uplifting converse. âAwfully depressing, this living alone in the world and doing nothing,â he observed as he âcurled and combed his comely head.â âI wonder if every fellow finds it as heavy work as I do.â âI have rounded that point,â said Wolverton. âI have broken myself fairly in to an idle, useless, unfruitful bachelor life. I am serious in these days, but never desperate.â âYou are confoundedly discouraging, Wolverton,â sulked the younger pleasure-seeker. âIs that all a fellow gets by giving himself up to having a good time?â âIf he gets any more, he is luckier than I am,â affirmed the elder man, composedly but with sincerity. âOn the whole I made a mistake in not marrying and going to work. That is, so I think. My notion is that a wife and children keep a man full of work and worry, and so cheer him up by relieving him of himself. It is like putting on a blister to mitigate the rheumatism. Both are bad enough, but the blister is the best.â Wetherel, a hopeful young egotist, never quite content in his selfishness, but always looking forward to a day when joy should be unconfined, was dismayed by this unlooked-for confession. âI have a great mind to turn a corner, and settle down to business, and perhaps marry,â he said. âWhy don't you?â answered Wolverton, who was a kindly-hearted creature enough, never doing mischief except when it was agreeable, and apt to wish well to young men. âAnd let me advise you to begin by making up that family quarrel. Go down to your uncle's villa and fall on his venerable bosom and get hold of the fatted calf. You are just a little bit of an idiot, youngster. A man who will quarrel with a million ought to have his organs examined. I have had softening of the brain myself occasionally; but I never yet was so far gone as to disagree with a million.â âIt isn't I who quarrel,â asserted Edward; and he was quite blindly serious in so declaring. âIt is the old one. He wants to govern me; wants to govern me physically, morally, and intellectually; wants to say what I shall eat, drink, think, and believe; wants to rule soul, body, inwards, and extremities. He is down on everything that a young man naturally prefers. Opposed to lager, opposed to dancing and whist, opposed to reading novels opposed to fashionable churches and episcopacy, opposed to everything but Plymouth Rock puritanism. How can a fellow submit to such prejudices and irrationality and domineering? Quarrel? I live my natural life and say my honest thought; and thereupon he exorcises me as if I were Apollyon. I only ask leave to be human, and he insists upon my being a ghost. His very way of talking makes his ideas forbidding. One word marches solemnly and grimly after another, like bearers at a funeral. At the end of every sentence you think he is dead and want to put up a gravestone. He makes religion disagreeable. I don't hate religion; I am capable of admiring it; in such a shape as Nestoria Bernard I can worship it.â It is more or less instructive to hear both sides in a controversy. From Edward's philippie, immoral and unreasonable as it was in the main, we can gather the regrettable fact that the exterior of Judge Wetherel's noble probity and sincere piety had some severe features which repelled instead of enticing, and that, had he been less exacting and inflexible in the minor matters of his moral law, he might more easily have led souls into his own circle of beliefs and sentiments. It is furthermore worth considering that this same Nestoria, whom the young man was so ready to accept as a model of attractive devoutness, found no difficulty in appreciating, respecting, and loving the Plymouth Rock puritan. One is tempted to query doubtfully whether two youthful people, who could look at the same standard character from such diverse standpoints, would be likely to join heart with heart for a journey through life, and whether, if they should so join, the result would be happy. Even that unenlightened worldling, Wolverton, a man little given to deep moral philosophizings and spiritual insights, could see through his friend's second-hand respect for religion in the form of a handsome girl, and smile at its preposterous magnanimity. âGracious youngster!â he grinned. âHow much you can put up with if it's only pleasant enough and pretty enough! Perhaps you could faney St. Cecilia, now, or the Sistine Madonna. However, I must put something to your credit; there are stupider sinners than you; there are men who wouldn't like the girl at all. Well, how much and how long are you going to worship the Final Good in her shape? I am interested in the child, and should like to know what is going to be done for her.â Wetherel made no reply; his face was agreeably pensive and his eyes softer than usual; he was pondering whether it would be well to fall in love with Nestoria. âWould you want to marry a staid little puritan, with a conscience and all that sort of thing?â asked Wolverton. âI don't object to piety in a wife,â responded the young man, with a liberality for which the Christian world surely ought to be grateful. âIndeed, I would rather have it. Do you suppose that I want one of the wild girls that I flirt with and everybody flirts with, and that have got all the down of innocent simplicity rubbed off them, and that know so much too much of pretty much everything?â âWell, it isn't nice; but plenty of fellows do marry just that sort; and somehow or other they make over as good as new. Our American girls are a queer lot; they seem to have an inexhaustible reserve of innocence laid up somewhere; when the first supply is out, they absorb more. However, I like this little seraph better than the other sort. She is such a replica of the one I knew! Why not keep her in mind? Such a match might bring you around with the Judge. I hate to see you lose that fortune.â âI don't know,â muttered Wetherel, with the vagueness of a man who is lost in troublous meditation. âIt is all a muddle. Life is a confounded muddle.â The wilful and impulsive youngster, who had taken his own way so stubbornly and got himself into difficulties thereby, was not quite certain that he had better do just what he wanted to do in the immediate future. He liked Nestoria much, and believed that he should easily learn to love her, and found it very pleasant to think of marrying her. But there was a great risk in the roseate adventure; there was a chance of dropping from the horns of the matrimonial altar into the trials of poverty; somewhat as the sacrificial infants of the Sidonians rolled out of the arms of the god into the blazing furnace beneath. He feared lest the Judge had already disinherited him; and he was quite sure that he had spent the last penny of his paternal fortune. Indeed, he was in debt; creditors had driven him from New York and other creditors from Saratoga; at this very moment he was subsisting on money borrowed from Wolverton. Fifty thousand dollars had danced through the gateways of pleasure, and only left him a craving for delights which he could no longer purchase. He had been one of those thoroughly headstrong and reckless youths who are so common in Europe and so rare in America. Strong emotions, thoughtless generosity, and an ostentatious love of expense had bankrupted him. In the last four years their malign magic had degraded him from the position of a youth of fair fortune, and made of him that wretched and ridiculous personage whom slang has christened a âdead beat.â Marry? Marry without a profession, without habits of labor, without a dollar to fee the parson? And suppose his uncle should be unrelenting, and give him nothing, and even decline to recommend him for a position in the custom-house? He knew that, from the staid and severe old man's point of view, he was untrustworthy and unendorsable and little less than abominable. He had disputed rules of conduct and articles of belief which the Judge held to be inexorably binding and tremendously important. There had been wild orgies in his life in Paris and painful scandals in his life in New York; and a sufficiently accurate report of these excesses had reached the horrified ears of his relative. Finally (and here was another terrible charge against him in the eyes of a prudent business man), he had been not only unwise in regard to the concerns of the other world, but reckless in the affairs of this, investing recklessly and utterly wasting his substance. For these things he had been sternly reproved, and warned that severe punishment would follow on continuance in evil, and all to no purpose. He had argued with lofty flippancy in defence of his ways, and had irritated his grave and conscientious adviser to the utmost. There had been a quarrel; the uncle had ceased to invite the nephew to his house; then he had sent for his more distant relatives, the Dinnefords; finally it was supposed that he had altered his will. This last story Edward did not credit, until, having spent or lost his ultimate dollar, he fell into that depression of spirit which poverty brings to those whom it visits for the first time. Now, living on borrowed money, he did fear seriously that he had sold his birthright for departed messes of pottage. As he mechanically continued his light labor of personal adornment he meditated on the pit into which he had stumbled, and on the chances of getting out of it. If he should reform, or pretend reformation; if he should humble himself before the Judge and lead a quiet life; if he should marry this daughter of a missionary, no doubt a pet with the devout master of Sea Lodge, would the riches which had taken wings fly back to him? The âdead beatâ was far from certain of it, and no wonder that his fine eyes were gloomy. âWell, Wolverton, we will see,â he said at last, trying to puff away his sorrows with a sigh. âI have a great mind to turn a corner, I don't like it. Be good, and you will be happy, but you won't have a good time. Now I want a good time. Still, it seems to be advisable to turn a corner and try the next street. Only we won't do it this evening. Let's get up some fellows and be jolly.â âThere are no fellows here, I suppose,â replied Wolverton. âNone of our fellows.â âI saw the Count in the reading-room as we came up stairs.â âWhat Count? There are so many counts!â âPoloski, as he calls himself,â said Edward, ringing the bell. âI'll have him up.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. A GENTLEMAN AND SCHOLAR. âPoloski!â grumbled Wolverton. âWhat the deuce is he here for? Run aground on the bottom of his purse and waiting for a chance to gamble, I suppose. What do you want him up for? I don't believe in him.â âThere is something in blood,â said Edward, remembering, with more than the pride of his uncle, that he was descended from many recorded Wetherels. âI suppose a count must be a gentleman in some one point of his character, if you can only discover what that point is.â âI never knew one in this country who could be trusted,â asserted Wolverton. âThey are all dead-beats, looking out for a rich marriage or some other chance to swindle somebody. And to the best of my travelling observation and study, four-fifths of those in Europe are no better. Poloski at any rate is a sucker. He is a sponge incarnate.â âYou needn't lend him anything. Tell him you have passed over all your flush to me. Come let's have him in. He is such a confounded blowhard and monkey that he is amusing.â âSend for him,â returned Wolverton, a lazily obliging man, as many idle people are. On the arrival of a waiter to answer the bell, Edward despatched him in search of the distinguished foreigner. âTall, light-complexioned fellow,â he explained. âLooks a little like me; perhaps a good deal.â âI wouldn't say that,â put in Wolverton when the servant had departed. âIt's a resemblance that isn't recommendatory.â âI don't brag of it,â laughed the young man. âBut I have been taken for him, and I know he can wear my clothes. Borrowed a tiptop suit once and never returned it. Fitted him like a glove. Whenever I met him in it, bowing and grimacing in his ridiculous style, I felt like saying, `How are you, you jackanapes of a Wetherel, and what are you cutting up those monkey-shines for?' â Presently the noble guest of American entered the room. He was certainly very like Wetherel; he had the same fair skin and hair, the same resolute blue eyes and prominent chin, the same height and slenderness; furthermore, he appeared to be of about the same age, although he was in reality several years older. The resemblance between the two men did not, however, extend to expression and manner. Poloski's expression was against him; it had unpleasant gleams of furtiveness and dexterity; it suggested a man who lives by his wits. In gesture and style of speaking he was more graceful and animated than the young American, or than Americans in general. Nor was it quite just to accuse him of âmonkey-shinesâ; his address, though lively, was human enough, and fairly agreeable. His accent in English was nearly perfect, which, I believe, is not a wonderful thing in a Pole. âHow do, Wolverton? How do, Wetherel?â he said in rapid, cheerful, pleasant tone, at the same time showing his teeth cordially. âSo glad to find you here! What a dull place this is, to be sure! But I am in luck. I was just thinking how I could pass the evening, and here you are; the riddle is solved. Thank you, Wolverton; I never refuse a cigar; at least, never yours. Have you taken tea? So have I. We have the evening before us, and it's all serene and the goose hangs high, as you Americans say. I like your slang, so fresh and picturesque, so full of metaphor. All slang is worthy of study; it is the source and life of language; speech would become dead without it. I read an essay on the slang of the Teutonic tongues before the Royal Society of Berlin. I will show it to you some day.â Wetherel gave Wolverton a glance which was as much as to say, âThere he goes again!â To boast of literary and scholarly attainments was one of the habits of the Count. He was continually telling you that he had written this or that elegant or recondite work, and promising to let you see it, only he never brought it. If he borrowed a book or bought one (which he frequently did on trust), he would usually remark, âI take this for the pleasure of studying the man's style; the subject is familiar to me.â âWhat brings you to the Athens of Connecticut, Count?â asked Wolverton, easily repressing what desire he had to examine the essay on the âSlang of the Teutonic Tongues.â âA young lady,â replied the noble stranger, showing his teeth with a glee which was close upon triumph. âWhat else could bring me anywhere? A lovely and dashing Miss Alice.â âFamily name?â inquired Wetherel. âI beg your pardon,â smiled the Count, leaning forward apologetically. âWhat is her family name?â repeated Wetherel. âAh, yes; Dinneford.â The two Americans exchanged glances, and Alice's second cousin looked slightly indignant. âI hoped for her at Newport, but she did not come,â continued Poloski. âSo I learned of her whereabouts and followed her to her retreat. Besides, I wanted a quiet seashore place. I propose to sail, fish, and pay court to Miss Dinneford.â âNice plan,â observed Wetherel, who had recovered his good humor, seeing perhaps a chance to make sport of his patrician. âI shouldn't wonder if you succeeded. You are a Pole, you know, and a long one, and they say the longest poles knock the persimmons.â âIs that a slang?â asked Poloski, with the joy of a discoverer. âBut I do not perceive the application. What is a persimmon, and what has a Pole to do with it?â âA persimmon is a fruit and a pole is a stick,â explained the young American, with an indifference which apologized for his poor joke. But the student of slang was delighted. âOh! I understand,â he exclaimed. âA Pole, yes! The longest poles knock the persimmons. Very good. I shall remember that.â âI know where you Dulcinea is staying,â continued Wetherel. âIf you want, I will take you to a quiet boarding-place in plain sight of the house where she is.â âWill you?â said the gratified Count. âI invite you to lodge there with me. We will make a summer together; that is, we will make an August together.â âHow are you off for stamps?â prudently inquired the American, not caring to furnish the funds for both. âThe locker is full of shot,â laughed Poloski, slapping a pocket. âI was in luck at Newport. Poker is for me a propitious pastime, a game of good fortunes. By the way, do you care to play to-nightâjust a little?â âNo, no,â said Wetherel, shaking his head with frank positiveness. âYou are too many for me.â âToo many for me,â repeated the Count. âAnother of your American slangs; and goodâvery expressive. Too many for me. Very good.â âYou had better go along with us, Wolverton,â added Wetherel. âThe place I mean is on Lighthouse Point. We can bathe and sail all we like, and there is fishing among the Thimble Islands. Come, old fellow; say you will.â âYes, say you will,â echoed Poloski, catching at the phrase as a new one. âWhere there's a will there's a way. Say you will, and then go it.â âWhile you're young,â suggested Edward. âYou are in the vein, Poloski. Tell him to go it while he's young.â âYes, go it while you're young,â laughed the Count, enjoying this sort of talk amazingly; for was it not linguistic exercise and getting a mastery over slang? âThat will do,â said Wolverton. âI don't mind trying it for a few days.â He did not care to leave his young friend with Poloski, lest there should be poker and the funds which he had loaned should evaporate. At the same time he approved of the selection of Lighthouse Point as a place of sojourn, for the reasons that it was within easy reach of Sea Lodge, and that it was quite natural that Edward should want to be near Nestoria, and that good might come of his being near his uncle. On the following day, therefore, this trio drove in a hack to the Point and secured lodgings in the house of one of those seaside farmers who combine fishing with agriculture and âsummer board.â Remembering that the Count came hither in order to be within flirting reach of the âlovely and dashingâ Miss Alice, and appreciating with due sympathy his fond dreams of walking daily under her window and gesticulating at it with a sentimental handkerchief, we can imagine the surprise and discontent with which he learned that she dwelt on the opposite side of the harbor, divided from his palpitations by three miles of salt water. âI thought you told me it was close by,â he remarked with a grin of annoyance. âIn plain sight, I said,â returned Wetherel. âDon't you see it?â âYes, I see it. But what is the use? I cannot pay court through a telescope; and she will not even know that I am here. One might as well be the man in the moon. How am I ever to reach there?â âLeander swam the Hellespont, and I will swim this here,â chanted Edward. âHow shockingly you sing,â sulked Poloski. âNo Americans have ear or voice. And the air is utterly common.â At the same time he resolved that if Wetherel ever should enter the lists of poker with him he would show him no merey. âIf you don't like swimming, you can sail,â continued the American. âTake a boat and go over there by moonlight. No young lady could resist it.â âDelightful!â cried the Count, cheering up at once. âExquisitely romantic! My dear Wetherel, you sing charmingly. When will you go?â Edward reflected for a moment. Should he take this adventurer, this possibly vulgar impostor, into the neighborhood of his relatives? Well, yes; there was little likelihood of serious harm resulting; his cousin was sufficiently experienced in flirtations to be able to take care of herself. Furthermore, why should he be tender of Alice? The Dinnefords had been injurious to his prospects in life, as he supposed; and perhaps if they should commit a folly, if Alice should accept the attentions of this absurd and dubious Count, it might diminish their noxious influence; the strict and practical old Judge might take a disgust to them and turn again to favor his nephew. In allowing these thoughts to rule him he did not see proof that he was a bad fellow; he merely understood in a careless way that he was justifiably vindictive and intelligently politic. How element we are apt to be in the matter of charging meanness or guilt upon ourselves! There is surely some need of an accusing angel. But in spite of his egoism and his imperfect perception of the beautiful and good in conduct, he did feel bound, if only out of respect to himself, to give the Count a warning that the proprieties must be strictly observed, even in paying suit to a young lady who could be fairly described as âdashing.â âYou must understand, Poloski,â he said, âthat this Miss Alice is my second cousin.â âYou astonish me,â bowed the Count. âI incline to your authority.â âI don't boast any,â continued Edward. âHer mother and her uncle claim all there is, I suppose. And besides, I believe that the girl is more than your match, and that you can't fascinate her.â âAt least permit me to pay her my humble respects,â begged Poloski. âWe will sail over there,â assented Edward. âI have my own reasons for going. And you may walk by the house once and wave your handkerchief.â So, one moonlit evening, Wetherel took Poloski in a âsharpyâ and piloted him to the other shore; and there, as we already know, they came upon Alice Dinneford, lighteartedly watching for adventures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE FLIRTATIONS OF A PHILOLOGIST. âCome up here,â Alice Dinneford had called, when Edward announced himself and his companion from the boat. âOh, Count Poloski!â she added, with a hearty laugh as the two men clambered the face of the little bluff and reached her side. âWho could have imagined meeting you here! Isn't this romantie! Isn't it bully!â she paraphrased, remembering the Count's appetite for slang. âDid you sail all the way from Newport? Where do you hail from and where are you bound?â Like a youthful veteran in flirtations, as she was, she was not a bit embarrassed, much less frightened. âI have hailed from clouds of despair and I am bound in chains of admiration,â replied Poloski, somewhat elaborately polite and complimentary, as continental Europeans are apt to be in our judgment. Alice laughed again very merrily, immensely amused with his turn of her inquiry, and amused too with the situation. âI know, I know,â she said. âYou are always in chains for every lady you see. I thought you were at Newport, worshipping a hundred of them.â âI was at Newport,â admitted the Count, with a look which seemed to cast scorn upon the place. âBut how could I stay at Newport when Miss Dinneford was not there?â âOh, of course you couldn't,â declared Alice with renewed laughter. âWho could? Of course the men are leaving Newport by hundreds because I am not there. Oh, Count, how you gentlemen from Europe do flatter! You tell us simple American girls all the fine things that you used to tell the grand ladies of all the courts. And some of us believe every word you say.â She laughed at his compliments, and yet she was gratified by them; she laughed at the man himself, and yet she liked to have him about her; was he not an admirer, and was he not a noble? While Poloski was fishing in the depths of his fancy for another scrap of adulation, she turned to her relative with a graver air than she had worn hitherto, and asked, âWhere are you staying, Cousin Edward?â âAt Brown's, on the other side of the bay,â he said. âThe Count and Mr Frank Wolverton are with me. We thought we could amuse ourselves there for a while. How is your mother?â âShe is very well, thank you,â the girl replied mechanically. âAlways well and in good spirits, you know.â âAnd my uncle?â he added after a pause. âAs usual,â she said. It was not easy for her to talk with Edward on that subject. In the first place, it suddenly occurred to her that if the strict and prudent old gentleman should hear of her being out alone with her present company, he would not take the adventure in an approving spirit. Furthermore, she knew of the family quarrel; and she guessed that there might be a last will and testament of a retributive character; a will, possibly, that would lead Edward some day to denounce her and her mother as unprincipled and grasping intriguers. âAre you coming to see him?â she faltered. âSome day I may venture,â he replied moodily. âWill you!â she exclaimed cheerfully; for she was not selfish, knowing indeed too little of the value of money to be greedy about it; and she would have been heartily glad of a reconciliation between the young man and the old one, even though it cost her much filthy lucre. âI wish you would,â she added. âMamma and I will do our best to make the visit pleasant to you.â âYou are a good cousin,â said Edward, taking her hand and pressing it. This unexpected praise, uttered in such a moving tone of honest thanks, brought a little flash of moisture into the girl's eyes. She was profoundly gratified that her generosity of feeling had been understood and appreciated. Light-headed trifler as she was, there was a solid foundation of goodness and kindness in her, discoverable to serious souls by dint of happy accident or severe delving. Perhaps we may venture to affirm that every woman has as many characters as a cat has lives. Her utterance of friendship brought her a reward which she had not desired and for which she was not thankful. Wetherel had intended to give her a little season of lovely flirtation with Poloski; he had been mean enough and hard enough to decide that she might fall a victim, if she chose, to the fellow's fortune hunting blandishments; but now his finer feelings and moralities recovered their power, and he decided to watch over her. Seating himself on a bowlder, with his face toward the shining of the sea, he said, âGo on with your talk about Newport, you two, and don't mind a dull fellow who wants to mope.â âMiss Alice, when you speak of courts, you speak of your own proper sphere,â put in the Count, who had at last discovered the compliment for which he had been searching. âI should be most glad to see you in regal circles. I should take high pleasure in introducing you. It would give me the greatest satisfaction to behold your triumphs over all those ladies that we have to pay our compliments to when we are at home.â âOh, don't!â said Alice, who was still thinking of the Wetherel imbroglio, and could not at once recover her frolicsomeness. âYou are piling up the agony a little too high, as the comic men in the newspapers express it.â âPiling up the agony!â echoed the rejoiced Count. âThat is another slang, isn't it? How expressive it is, and diverting! Yes, Miss Dinneford, I will pile up the agony; I will pile it up as high as the clouds. My heart shall be crushed under it.â Alice could be grave no longer; she shouted with laughter. âYou mustn't do it,â she said. âIt would be too painful to contemplate. There wouldn't be a dry eye on earth.â âBut I must,â persisted Poloski enthusiastically. âIt is in my nature to do it. And it is in yours toâtoâââ âTo grin and bear it,â suggested Alice. âAnother slang!â fairly yelled the delighted nobleman and linguist. âWhat a language! It is so rich, so flashing, that it makes me wink. This English tongue is one vast orientalism. It is one tangled forest of metaphor. I have written a work on the Migrations of Metaphor, which was published in German by order of the Imperial Society of Vienna. I will give you a beautiful copy of it, Miss Alice.â âDon't fail,â urged Alice, who did not understand a word of German, and never read anything more solid than a book of travels. After a short silence Poloski added, with a mazed and helpless expression of countenance, âI have forgot what I was wanting to say.â âYou were talking about your great work,â suggested the young lady. âNo, no; it was not that. Ah, I remember. Your nature. You did not let me conclude. I was going to say it was in your nature to make men pile up the agony. And then comes the question, What shall they do? How shall they be relieved?â âWhy, let them go up to the top of their respective agonies and jump off,â laughed the girlish trifler. âCapital!â roared the Count. âIt is true; there is no other escape; and now, see me, I shall jump off,â he concluded, swinging his arms as if he were about to leap into the harbor. âOh, do stop him,â laughed Alice, almost in convulsions. âI shall have hysterics in a minute. Count Poloski, you will certainly get a tumble if you are not more careful, and then all the fashionable watering-places will cry their eyes out.â At this moment Edward asked, âWho is that up the beach, Alice?â Miss Dinneford uttered a little cry. âDear me! And I have left her alone all this time. The darling little dove will fly back to Mount Ararat.â âIs it Miss Bernard?â continued Wetherel, rising and facing toward the dimly seen figure. âI wondered you should be out without her. But I supposed she was dutifully reading the `Puritan Recorder' to the elder people.â âAnd you didn't like to ask about her because you wanted so much to hear. I understand the timorous ways of young gentlemen. But how well you know her! She does read the `Puritan Recorder' to the elder people. Isn't she a good, dear little thing? I think her queer name just suits her. Nestoriaâ isn't it oddâand pretty?â âWhat is Nestoria?â put in the Count. âA visitor and friend of mine,â explained Alice. âAnd, oh, such a perfect little angelic beauty!â âIs she rich?â eagerly queried the noble foreigner. âNo,â petulantly responded Miss Dinneford, turning cool at once. âWhat a question to ask about a good, lovely girl!â âIt is a pity,â persisted Poloski, firm in his own opinion concerning the desirableness of lucre. âEvery beauty deserves to be rich. A philosopher desires to see completeness. It is a shame to fortune when a beauty cannot dress beautifully. What did you say is her queer name?â âNestoria.â âThere is a people called Nestorians,â commented the omniscient Count. âI wrote an Inquiry into the Origin of the Nestorians. I will give it to you some day.â âWhere are you going?â called Alice to Wetherel, who was strolling away. âHe is going to make an inquiry into the Nestorian future,â simpered the gallant Poloski, even more ready than a woman to suspect a courtship. Edward could not resist the temptation of an interview with Nestoria. Indeed, he never even thought of trying to resist it; fighting temptation was not his favorite spiritual warfare; if he could be said to fight at all it was on the side of desire. A creature of impulse, he rarely asked himself whether a thing were right or wrong, but simply whether it would be pleasant and easy to do; and if it so seemed, he did it. It was lucky for him that his impulses were in general not such as the world has agreed to consider inhuman, degraded, and dishonorable. It was not moral principle and not self-control, it was merely an innate kindliness and that species of moral culture which is called a sense of honor, that had saved him from being a violator of laws and a criminal. He had a sort of conscience, but its main strength lay in self-respect and in respect for the name of Wetherel, and its boundaries of action were neither large nor well defined. He had also profound possibilities of moral and sentimental energy; but those abysses had never yet been stirred into action by either events or teachings. We see what he was now doing, and how impulsively he set about it. Neither his speaking to Nest ria nor his leaving Alice with the Count was likely to conduce to good, and either might bring about trouble and evil. But he did not reflect upon that; he simply followed his inclination. âI am going to talk to Miss Bernard,â he said over his shoulder. âYou two can come on at your leisure.â The flighty Alice fluttered a moment, seemed to be upon the point of following him, and at last, entangled by her love of flirtation and frolic, loitered. âTell her I will be with her in a minute,â she called, and then turned a coquettish smile upon the joyful face of the fortune-hunting Poloski. Thus it happened that Edward Wetherel, striding hastily through the deep, noiseless sand, came unseen and unheard upon Nestoria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. A DAUGHTER OF ZION AND A SON OF BELIAL. When Edward reached Nestoria she was gazing upon the moonlit sea, lost in a dreamy admiration of its dimpling sparkling glory, and scarcely conscious of the protracted absence of her friend. Hearing footsteps close behind her, she took it for granted that Alice had returned, and said, without looking around, âAh, there you are. Isn't it beautiful!â Wetherel, halting close by her shoulder, gazed down with enthusiastic admiration upon her fair face and golden hair, to which the moonlight communicated such an unearthly radiance that she seemed more seraphic than human, and responded, meaning her more than the landscape, âYes, very beautiful!â âOh!â was the very natural exclamation of the startled girl, as she sprang to her feet. Then recognizing him, she added. âIs it you, Mr. Wetherel? You frightened me.â âI am sorry,â he said, and so he was in a cheerful sort of fashion, his slight regret being mingled with joy at seeing her and a tender yearning to put re assuring arms about her. âIt was excessively awkward in me,â he went on, keenly enjoying his apology. âI was so anxious to reach you that I forgot that I might alarm you.â âWhere is Alice?â she asked, doubting whether she ought to be alone with him, but doubting it, let us observe, through a purely instinctive shyness, and not because she suspected him of being unfit company. âShe is there, with a friend of mine. She will be here in a moment.â He barely touched the girl's hand, and then dropped it, so fearful was he of still further disquieting her. Strange what an influence she already had over him! she could transfigure him both in character and manner. In her presence he seemed a different young fellow from the one whom we have heard pouring out his recklessness and bitterness of spirit in the society of Wolverton; and, for the moment at least, he was a very much better fellow than he was capable of being amid unrestraining and evil surroundings. There was something good left in his nature; he could perceive the charm of innocence, if only it wore the guise of beauty; he could, for the sake of the beauty, adore the innocence. He was as gentle and reverent with Nestoria now as if he had never been ungentle and irreverent with other women. Not a sentiment that was unworthy, and not even a reminiscence. Not a thought of other girls whom he had made weep bitter tears; who had wept at parting with him when they ought to have wept only that they had ever met him; who had wasted on his hitherto ungrateful spirit both affection and pardon. He forgot all the evil of his life, and seemed to himself not merely to be good now, but to have been good always. The prime cause of this transformation, it will be easily guessed, was that he was somewhat in love. âDid you come in that boat?â asked Nestoria. âIt seems as if you must have sailed out of the moon. Where did you come from?â âI have been living opposite you for the last two days. Only two miles from you, and in plain sight. Didn't you guess it?â âHow could I?â returned the girl, and the answer really pained him. âDon't you find it very dull here?â he continued, driven to make conversation. âNot a bit, I am happy and amused every moment. I find your relatives delightfulâMrs. Dinneford and Alice and the JudgeâI like them all.â While he stumbled through some reply she fell into a meditation, not even hearing what he said, her mind was so occupied. The question which engaged her spirit was, Should she allude to the family quarrel and try to end it? It grieved her beyond expression that two such men as Edward Wetherel and his uncle, two men who, in her eyes, were altogether noble and charming, should disagree. She liked them both very much, and she wanted them to like each other, not merely because their reconciliation would enable her to see them both, but also because it would increase their happiness. Besides, they were relatives, and for relatives to live in enmity, how unnatural and dreadful! If any one has inferred from Nestoria's simple ways and innocent air that she was deficient in moral courage and energy, he has done her injustice. Duty was a mighty force in her soul, and at its call she could face much. Was it her duty to examine this agreeable young gentleman about his misunderstanding with his good uncle and to urge him to bring it to a close? That was the whole question, she said to herself; and her liking for him helped her to decide it in the affirmative. âWhy haven't you been to visit Judge Wetherel?â she asked with a firmness of voice and manner which surprised him. âDon't you remember?â he replied, almost submissively. âWe are not on terms.â âBut why are you not on terms?â she continued, still resolute, though with a propitiatory, pleading smile. âIs it your faultâor his?â âIt is not my fault,â he burst out. âLook here, Miss Bernard; I will talk with you frankly about this matter. But first, has he told you anything against me?â âNo,â said Nestoria. âNor any one.â âThen I mustn't talk harshly,â he went on more tranquilly. âBut still I will be as frank as I must. I want you to think charitably of me. The whole thing, then, is this: Am I to be governed? I don't quarrel with him, but he with me. Why? He wants to rule me, and I don't want to be ruled. He wants to humiliate me, and I won't be humiliated. We both have our ideas. I leave him to enjoy his; why can't he leave me in peace with mine? But he can't. I must do and think and talk precisely as he learned to do and think and talk three-quarters of a century ago. The older a man is, the more unfit he is to hold absolute rule over the young, because his notions are necessarily different from theirs, while not necessarily better. Suppose Adam were alive now and wanted all his progeny to obey him. Can't you see that his ideas might be unsuitable for the men of our day? What a time we should probably have with the old gentleman, to be sure, and how grimly he would glare at us through his spectacles, and how he would wave us off his premises! Well, my uncle is not so very unlike what Adam might be. He has fearfully old-fashioned whims, and he is tremendously stiff in them. I have been driven, out of mere honesty and self-respect, to rebel. I am carrying on my war of independence. You have heard of our revolutionary sires, and how they fought seven years for an abstraction, as the great Daniel phrased it. I don't mean the prophet, but the expounder.â So he went on for some minutes. He had thought so much of this quarrel and argued its merits over to himself so often that his mind was brimming full of it. He could talk about it as abundantly as an enthusiast can declaim about his pet whim wham: a woman's rights champion, for instance, about female suffrage, or a communist about a new division of property. He was in earnest, and indeed he was at heart very bitter, notwithstanding his jocosities about Adam and our revolutionary fathers. This tone of jesting was assumed partly to keep down his painful irritability, and partly to hide it from Nestoria. He wanted to convince the girl, not only that he was right in the quarrel, but also that he was a good-tempered, pleasant fellow. Being very much taken with her, and for the moment at least not a little in love with her (she looked so musually beautiful just then in the moonlight), he could not bear to have her think ill of him in any fashion whatever. Of course his defence of himself was mainly special pleading, and quite an unfair representation of his uncle's case against him. Did he know it? We must be so honestly severe with him, we must so far expose the inteilectual weakness which had grown out of his moral one-sidedness, as to declare that he was by no means fully aware of it. His dissipation did not seem to him wickedness; it was merely, as he tenderly put it to himself, âsowing his wild oatsâ; it was what one ought to expect of a young man, and rather admire in him than otherwise. Even the exalting and purifying presence of Nestoria's innocence could not so far lift him above his usual level as to enable him to see that his life had been notably blameworthy. In short, very unluckily for his soul and his fortunes, he could neither condemn himself harshly, nor forgive the Judge for condemning him. Nestoria was much perplexed and a little troubled. She did not feel pleased with some remarks that this admirable young man had dropped. With the reverent sensitiveness of a youthful soul which has received a purely religious education, she did not like to hear even the great Daniel Webster linked jocosely with that sacred Daniel who would not worship the gods of Babylon, while the story of Adam seemed to her the story of a great moral tragedy, altogether too solemn to be alluded to lightly. Furthermore, how could her judicious and venerable and pious friend, the Judge, be altogether wrong in this matter? It was extremely painful to her that Edward should speak of that good man as he had, charging him with holding ideas that were current before the flood, and hinting at his glaring at unconvinced people through his spectacles, and waving them irrationally off his premises. What if beliefs were antediluvian, so long as they were sensible and holy and fruitful of good works? Enoch no doubt held antediluvian notions, and yet he was judged worthy of translation. However, Nestoria did not feel able to take up an argument with this wonderful Edward Wetherel, as indeed it was not in her habits or disposition to argue, not even with herself. Her usual mental process in matters open to discussion was to choose the right with the lucid instinct of a pure, conscieutious nature, and to simply say with the utmost gentleness, Why not do it? It is a wonderfully effective mode of discussion, when one is gifted for it, and frequently dulls the edge of the keenest hair-splitting. âHe is much older than you,â she sighed, after remaining some time in thought. âCouldn't you put up with something on that account?â âPerhaps so,â mumbled Edward, feeling that his allocution had all been for naught. Then, his eyes still settled with steadfast admiration on her beaming face, he added, âI would much rather put up with something on your account.â âWill you come to the house soon and try to see him?â she pleaded, so eager in her work of reconciliation that she did not notice his flattery. âYes,â he assented. âYes, I will. Only, if you discover me coming, you must ask him to see me.â âI will be on the lookout for you,â she promised. âOh, I am not a bit afraid to ask him. He is so good, and it will be such a right thing to do! Be sure you come.â âYes, yes,â he repeated eagerly more delighted with the interest that she took in his affairs than with the prospect of reconciliation with his uncle, and so emboldened by that interest that he seized her hand and tried to kiss it. But the kiss went wild, for Nestoria snatched her fingers away, saying, âYou mustn't.â It was enough; that gentle âmustn'tâ quelled him; it was mightier than a box on the ear from some girls. âIt is an Oriental custom,â she added, fearful that she had seemed unfriendly. âBut I don't like it. It is the salute of an inferior to a superior, and it seems to me degrading to humanity.â He would have liked a kiss of a more equal and exalted order, but he knew the girl too well and respected her too tenderly to ask it. At this moment Alice reached them on a little rustling run, calling breathlessly, âCome, Nettie, we must go. We shall miss prayers. Good-night, Cousin Edward. Come again.â âGood-night, Mr. Wetherel,â added Nestoria, and the two girls hurried away. âI will try it,â muttered Edward to himself. âI'll see if the old gentleman has a soft spot in him, confound him!â It is sadly wonderful to observe how heartily relatives can dislike each other, if their characters and tastes are in distinct opposition, and especially if they are a drag on each other's pleasures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. WARNINGS WASTED. âHOW do you like Edward?â asked Alice Dinneford on the morning after the adventure by moonlight. âI like him very much,â replied Nestoria, with her characteristic frankness and simplicity, a childlike smile of pleasure rising to her lips at the sound of the name, and her eyes lighting up with eagerness to hear more of the subject. Alice looked at her friend in amazement; such straightforwardness in a young lady on such a topic surprised and puzzled her; she could not judge from it whether Nestoria liked Edward a great deal or only a little. âWhat is the matter?â asked the missionary's daughter, while a blush of gathering embarrassment mounted into her cheeks and burned away there like a conflagration, until her very ears tingled. âHave I said anything very singular?â âI never saw such another girl,â said Alice. âDo you really mean that you think very highly of Edward?â âHe has been so kind and polite to me!â apologized Nestoria, the blush meanwhile blazing in a manner to put one in mind of invaders ravaging some fair country with fire. âHow can I help being grateful to him?â Miss Dinneford became uneasy; it occurred to her that she had done wrong in leaving this artless child alone with her engaging but untoward relative; it was much as if she had abandoned Parley the Porter to the wiles of that courteous desperado, Mr. Flattery. In her own womanish, indirect way she set about neutralizing whatever mischief might have resulted from Edward's fascinations, by suggesting another admirer. âThis youngster is pleasant enough,â she observed quietly. âBut I have another cousin who would suit you a great deal better. It is Cousin Walter. He isn't wonderfully handsome, perhaps, but he is wonderfully good.â âAnd isn't Mr. Wetherel good?â asked Nestoria, startled by such a cruel suspicion that she could not conceal her concern, nor even think of concealing it. âOh, Edward is well enough,â hastily answered Alice, who had a natural and generous repugnance to speaking ill of her relative, and in fact did not think at all harshly of him because of his wild ways. âHe is as good, I dare say, as young men average. What I mean is that he isn't of your sort.â âAlice, tell me the truth!â exclaimed Nestoria, losing her self-possession in her anxiety. âIs Mr. Wetherel a bad man?â âI didn't say so,â cried Alice, thoroughly discomposed. âWhy, what nonsense! Didn't I tell you,â she added, driven by erring good-nature into a fib, âdidn't I just tell you that he is well enough? Only this other one is so awfully good,â she hurried on, seeking to slip away from the subject of that somewhat dubious Edward. âHe, I mean Cousin Walter, is fit to be a missionary. I never hear him talk without thinking of St. Paul, or some such good little man. We expect him here very soon, and you will be delighted with him, or I don't know your tastes. Another relative, a Cousin John, is coming with him; and that is all the cousins there are of us; big box, little box, band-box, and bundle; just four cousins. Cousin John is the big box, for he is large and lumbering and noisy. Walter is the little box; oh, he is too little for anything; he is about your size. Edward is the band-box; and I must pass for the bundle. All women are bundles, just good to be handed about and to be in the way. And don't we make a fuss over each other when we get together! You would suppose there were no other people in the world than Dinnefords and Wetherels and their relatives. It is just like Noah's family coming out of the ark, with everybody else drowned and got rid of and out of mind. I hope you will put up with us. You must like Walter in spite of his littleness, and John Bowlder, too, in spite of his bigness.â Alice could prattle like a running brook, and she did her talkative best on this occasion, struggling to get away from that ugly topic of Edward's charactor, and struggling with success. The bell rang for prayers; they rustled down stairs in obedience to it; then followed the quiet routine of a Sea Lodge day; the customary talk with the Judge about Nestorian missions, and other such godly matters; the drives after old Sorrel, the readings and the walkings. Meantime Nestoria had Edward's promise constantly in mind, and kept an anxious lookout for his expected call. Not, however, until the afternoon of the next day, as she was reading the âPuritan Recorderâ or some similar edifying publication to the Judge in his study, did she behold the young man entering the front gate of the grounds, a desired and yet alarming visitant. Her heart gave a great leap of unexpected terror; she looked at the Judge as a forlorn hope looks at the death-dealing rampart which it must storm; and then, repeating to herself her watchword of âduty,â she set on gallantly. Laying down her journal she walked firmly up to the old man, met his inquiring gaze with a pleading smile, and said. âYour nephew is coming.â âEdward!â murmured the Judge, getting on his feet in his slow way, much as a cautious man, fearful of falling, gets on a horse, and deliberately bringing his spectacles to bear upon the astonishing apparition. âWon't you see him?â begged Nestoria. âI think he wishes a reconciliation. I want you to see him.â The Judge stared at her; then his glassy eyes settled on vacancy, as was his manner when in earnest thought; at last he said solemnly, âWe are taught out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. Yes, I will see him.â Nestoria had one of those impulses which sometimes perform moral miracles. Putting up her hands with spasmodic eagerness, she drew Mr. Wetherel's hoary head down to her and kissed his wrinkled cheek. The old gentleman was helpless in her soft grasp; his caput was no more under his control than if it had been in a charger, borne before the daughter of Herodias; his venerable neck bent as easily as male necks generally do when lovely woman pulls at them. Perhaps it was the first kiss that he had received in many years, for his austere deportment did not tempt to such familiarities, just as his serious spirit did not crave them. But he was evidently gratified by this touch of affectionate emotion; he looked very kindly after the girl as she hurried out of the study. It is pretty certain, too, that he did not comprehend all the motives which had prompted the kiss; for after Nestoria had left him he murmured with grave simplicity, âThe intereession of the righteous availeth much.â With this promise of peace on his thin, and one might almost say trenchant lips, he hurried his heavy, squeaking boots to the front door of the house, and opened it to the prodigal nephew. âHow do you do, uncle?â said the surprised young man; to which the Judge answered with solemn though courteous brevity, âCome in.â When both were in the study, the senior closed the door, motioned his nephew to a chair, seated himself with his usual rheumatic deliberation, and observed, perhaps too much in the tone of a father confessor, or of a physician who is called to prescribe in a difficult case, âYou wished to converse with me?â âI am very much obliged to you for granting me an interview,â bowed Edward. Then he paused, much perplexed and already a little indignant; for, in the first place, he did not know how gracefully to begin his act of submission; in the second place, it seemed to him that his potent relative was cruelly formal. âIf our meeting should bear any acceptable fruit,â responded the Judge, âI will express myself as under obligations to you.â It was not a cordial speech, and it was stiffly uttered; but the old man felt that he had before him a great criminal. âWe parted on ill terms,â said the youngster, making a violent effort to descend into the valley of humiliation. âI am sorry for it.â âSo am I,â answered the Judge. âI am not willingly on ill terms with any human being, and much less with my own flesh and blood. You are the son of my dearest and brightest brotherâthe last brother that was spared to meââ He suddenly came to a pause. If the youngster could have believed his eyes, if he could have had faith in the tenderness and affection of an old man, he might have been aware of a pathetic moisture behind those spectacles. The aged, especially such as have been left nearly alone in the world, are sometimes piteously shaken by the remembrance of a bereavement. âYou are Henry's son,â continued the Judge, mastering his always tremulous voice. âI had accepted you in the place of all my own children whom God took to himself long ago. You are the last Wetherel of our stock. I do not think I am wrong in prizing the name of Wetherel. It represents to my mind so many pious men and women who have led worthy, devout lives on this favored New England soil, and have been translated from it to Paradise! I must and do venerate and love the name. I desire to see it continued in prosperity if it can also be continued in godliness. And you are the last Wetherel! How can I willingly be on ill terms with you?â The young man bowed silently and with a seriousness which showed emotion. He too, we know, was proud of the name, and his uncle's feeling on the subject moved him. âBut I cannot love sin nor abet sinners,â continued the old man. âIf I am guided by any one motive in life, it is, I humbly trust, a sense of duty. That motive I must obey, whatever my natural desires may be, whatever my earthly affections may urge. It will not let me hold fast to hands which are full of wickedness, nor rejoice in feet which run in the ways of the scorner.â âYou put it very strongly, sir,â said the nephew, his Wetherel temper and stubbornness rising. âI have lived the life of a young man. That is all.â âHow can you abuse language thus?â demanded the Judge. âHave you lived the life of that young man whom Jesus loved? Is the life of a young man necessarily a seandal to all pure men and pure women? I must be plain with you, Edward, as I have always been. You have lived the life which leads to eternal death. You have banded yourself with the impure and with mockers. Your chosen comrades have been the noisy sons of Belial. I will not speak, for very shame and pity, of your own deeds and words. You know well what they have been, and that they must fill me with horror.â Edward was by this time angry and disgusted; he could not see that he had been such a wretch as his uncle painted him; and the portrait, as held up to his eyes, seemed the work of irrational prejudice and hostility. He was tempted to speak out in bitter wrath, and with difficulty controlled the unwise impulse. âI came here to ask a reconciliation,â he said sullenly. âI see little prospeet of obtaining it.â âYou see it, then, in your own heart,â declared the persuaded Judge, conscious of rectitude. âIn mine, if you had that sight which looks into hearts, you would discover earnest yearning for kindliness. I ask for but one concessionârepentance of evil.â âYou want reformation, I suppose,â muttered Edward. âYes, repentance and its fruits. I would not believe in the soundness and durability of reformation unless I could also see wise and devout sorrow for the past. Where there is no root there can be no worthy fruit.â The young man hesitated, querying what he should say. He could not feel that he repented of his life of gayety, which had been to him while his money lasted a life of real pleasure, so strong were his physical powers of enjoyment and so keen his social instincts. But should he not, rather than lose all chance of succeeding to his uncle's estate endeavor to counterfeit a penitential spirit? For a little time the two men remained silent, the younger fluctuating between passion and the dictates of policy, and the elder praying in soul for that other soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. AN HEIR-AT-LAW DISINHERITED. After a minute of meditation, which was as terrible to bear as a nightmare, Edward rose, with a sense of great physical labor, to his feet, uplifting, indeed, a fearfully heavy load, the burden of his fate. Proud, frank, and in a certain sense noble-hearted, his inmost soul rejected the prostration of hypocrisy. Moreover, the hopefulness of youth, that joyous confidence of springtime blood which so incessantly prophesies smooth things, came like a proclamation of good auguries to his support, and heartened him to face his destiny. Finally, he was stubborn and pugnacious; like a true Wetherel, he could not bear to be beaten. âI will not be a humbug,â he declared, looking his uncle steadily in the face. âWhen I do repent of my life I will frankly tell you of it. But at present I do not see that it has been a disgraceful one. I will merely promise this: I will take up a profession and study it hard; I will also reform my expenses.â The mere sound of his own voice was convincing to him, and by the time he had finished his speech he thought that he had made a great concession But the Judge could not thus look upon the matter; he was aware of nothing but a burst of pride, perverseness, and wickedness. âIt is enough,â he answered, his voice even more tremulous with grief and indiguation than with age. âIt only remains for me to tell you what I must now do. I love my own name. I could wish to see the name of Wetherel written on the gates of prosperity. But when that name is blazoned in the haunts of sin I will not enrich it. The wealth of which God has made me steward shall not pave the broad way which leads to death. My estate will be parted among objects of benevolence and between my three worthy relatives, Mrs. Dinneford, Alice Dinneford, and Walter Lehming. You will owe me no thanks, and you need offer me no service.â Brave as Edward was, and enduring as he strove to be, he turned pale. He had partially expected this threat and had tried to brace himself against it; but no man can be fully prepared for the complete shock of ruin, and for an instant this perverse youngster tottered. How could he ever study his proposed profession without money? All at once, moreover, it struck him that he had lost Nestoria; that even if he were able to meet with her again, he could not marry her. He looked at the old man with a feeble hope that he might not be fully in earnest; but one moment's study of that confirmed countenance and those settled eyes dispelled the misty doubt. âThese hands,â he declared, throwing them out violently, âshall support me.â âIt will be well for you,â replied the Judge, learning for the first time, but without surprise, that the young man's property was gone. âIn honest labor you may find renovation.â âGood morning, sir,â added Edward, his voice almost choked with passion. But as he walked away he remembered Nestoria, and thought that he might like to see her again, even under these wretched circumstances, and perhaps all the more because of them. âAm I to understand that you turn me out of your house?â he asked, pausing at the door. âGod forbid,â replied the Judge. âThis house is open to every human creature. I would not assume to bar entrance to it to any one, not even though he were my enemy. You are welcome at all times, for every decorous purpose.â Edward already repented of his defiance, not because it had been wrong, but because it had brought calamity. For an instant he was half disposed to apologize for it and to try to bring about a parting on kindlier terms. But he did not give way to this impulse for the reason that, as he believed, the attempt would degrade him, and would also be fruitless. He cast an angry, sidelong glance at his uncle, muttered to himself, âThe stubborn, prejudiced old fool!â bowed in silence, and departed. At the gate he turned and looked the house all over in a state of mind to lay his malediction upon it; but suddenly the whole building became illuminated with amiability to him; he had caught a glimpse of Nestoria at her window. âThe blessed damozel leaned out,â he murmured. âDear little golden-haired innocent! Was she watching me? Had she interceded for me? Do I owe her what little mercy was shown me by that old tyrant? I wish I could have seen her while I was talkingâI should have been more prudent, wiser. Ah!â and he drew a deep sigh, âif religion were always like her! Ten thousand uncle Jabezes could not convert me. But she mightâand may.â Then he resolved anew that, as soon as the vacations ended, he would commence the study of medicine, and that he would study it furiously. For her sake, he declared in his exaltation, he would labor terribly; he would endure, he would vanquish, he would make for himself name and fortune; and then he would lay his heart and all that he had at her feet. In his present condition of penury and friendlessness she seemed almost too high a match for him, and he began to long for her with feat, as men do for the difficult of attainment. Indeed, before he reached his own side of the bay, he had nearly resolved to propose to her on the first opportunity, lest some other should step in and secure the precious prize. That he might be unworthy of her acceptance did not occur to him distinctly, if at all. He would make himself worthy; to please her he would do what he would not to please his uncle; he would rule his life for love as he would not rule it for fear. Meantime Nestoria was most anxious to know the result of the interview; but although she got back to the Judge as soon as possible, she learned nothing. She longed to catechise him, but could not muster courage to do it. Duty had helped her to speak a word in favor of peace, but duty would not back her up in inquiring whether peace had been made. Furthermore, compared with this old gentleman she was a child, and taken in connection with his nephew she was a young lady; and both as a child and a young lady she was under bonds to be fastidiously modest and to withhold herself from prying into their secrets. The Judge might have told her something of the matter had it gone well; but it had turned into such an ugly and seemingly permanent skeleton that he did not wish to discourse of it to any one; and he had already acquired such a high opinion of this devout daughter of the âgreat and good Doctor Bernardâ that he did not suspect her of being specially interested in his scapegrace nephew. Once, indeed, happening to note that she was gazing at him intently, he remembered how she had asked him to further a reconciliation; but with a blindness as to the inner character and motives of young ladies for which we can hardly forgive him, he only said to himself, âBenevolent nature! She must be her father over again. No, it is not nature; it is grace.â Meantime the thought of the perverse Edward troubled his soul, and weighed down his prominent, sharp chin into his high stock, and filled his glassy eyes with stagnant speculation. It was observed by the family that he was much occupied during the rest of the day with business papers, and that he seemed to be drawing up some important document Next morning two gentlemen, known to be a lawyer and a banker, arrived in a buggy from New Haven, and were closeted with him for some minutes in his study. After their departure he summoned Mrs. Dinneford into the same minute apartment and showed her a long paper of a legal mien terminating in seals and signatures. âCousin Dorothy,â he said, addressing her exceptionally by her christened name, for usually he called her Mrs. DinnefordââCousin Dorothy, this is my will.â Mrs. Dinneford flushed and trembled; could not help hoping that she or Alice might get something; tried to feel ashamed of herself, and was decorously silent. âI have parted my raiment of lucre into four portions,â he continued tranquilly. âOne will go to religious and charitable institutions; one will go to yourself, my good and judicious cousin; one will go to Alice on her marriage, or at her twenty-fifth year; one will go to Walter Lehming.â Mrs. Dinneford had quivered from head to foot with a sort of painful joy when fortune began to pour its showers of gold in her direction; but as the old gentleman continued his statement she gradually lost her expression of pardonable satisfaction, and by the time he had finished her eyes were full of trouble. âAnd Edward?â she asked with an unselfishness which was worshipful. âEdward,â returned the Judge slowly, his vitreous gaze fixed sadly on vacuityââEdward will have nothing.â âOh, Cousin Wetherel!â exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford, in honest, beautiful distress. âMy conscience will not let me do otherwise,â declared the old gentleman, still staring straight before him into emptiness, as if determined not to see her imploring face. âDon't you love your nephew at all?â pleaded the excellent lady, with tears in her voice. âMoney is the root of all evil,â answered the Judge, so far disturbed that he sought to evade the query. âYes, it is the root of all evil, but it may be a blessing in disguise,â argued Mrs. Dinneford, who sometimes had a quick-witted though half unconscious cleverness of speech. âWhat harm has it done you, Consin Wetherel, or done through you? Providence has intrusted you with a great deal of it, and I am sure you would be puzzled to say how you have been the worse for the gift, or how your fellow creatures have suffered because of it.â âI have been helped, I have been restrained, I have been guided,â said the old man, looking upward in solemn gratitude. âBut to those who cast off grace money is always a root of evil. Money, more perhaps than any other thing else, has ruined Edward. Because he came to his majority with fifty thousand dollars in his hands, he has never worked, he has been a spendthrift, and he has fallen into the pitfalls of vice.â âI hope that Edward has not spent all his fortune,â murmured Mrs. Dinneford, ready to cry. âI believe that he has, and I trust that he has,â returned the Judge. âNothing will save him from destruction but a life of enforced labor.â âOh, Cousin Wetherel!â groaned the good woman again. âAnd he expected to live so differently! Do give himâyou know Alice and I have something of our ownâdo give him my share.â âNo!â said the millionaire, almost angrily. Unworldly as he was, or sought to be, he did not like to have his estate despised; and for a moment he was inclined to take his kinswoman's generous proposition as a personal affront. In the next breath he admitted to himself that this feeling was wrong, and added in a gentle voice, âMy dear Cousin Dorothy, you honor our family. But you must not urge me to give your dues to one who dishonors it.â âThis will make such trouble!â Mrs. Dinneford sighed. âI can't help quoting what Tupper says, severe as you may think it: `There is no greater evil among men than a testament framed with injustice.' And I agreeââ âI deny the injustice,â interrupted the Judge with a quickness of speech which was quite unusual with him, and which showed extreme irritation. âIs there any justice in giving God's benefits to the perversely ungodly?â âIt will make such trouble!â repeated Mrs. Dinneford, falling back upon the personal argument. âEdward will certainly feel that weâAlice and Iâhave wronged him. He will suspect us of being selfish, mean, managing people.â âI have stated in the will,â explained the inexorable testator, âI have stated distinctly, that it was prepared without your knowledge or consent. I have also stated, with as much consideration as possible, my reasons for disinheriting my nephew. Now let me beg of you not to argue with me further. I am very tired and must lie down.â And, indeed, the old man looked not a little shaken, as if disinheriting his nearest relative and the only other extant Wetherel had been a great hardship to him, and had drawn largely upon the currents of life which still trickled in his timeworn organism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. A WOOING PROPHETIC OF TROUBLE. The disinheritance of Edward and all those sorry doings of his which had led to it were kept secret from Nestoria; even the communicative Alice being averse to talking of the black sheep of the family and of the tremendous punishment which had overtaken his swartness. But while discretion is a virtue, it is not invariably a blessing to all whom it concerns; and things would have gone more comfortably and prosperously with the missionary's daughter had her friends been less reticent. Left in ignorance of the young man's real character, she continued to judge him mainly by his courtesy and amiability to herself; to look upon his misunderstanding with his uncle as his misfortune, rather than the result of his faults; and to think of him all the more kindly because of that mysterious calamity. Yes, the quarrel gave him an additional attraction in her eyes; it enlisted for him the unworldly purity and unworn fervor of her sympathy; it drew on that passion of pity which in woman's heart is so near the fountains of affection. She prayed by herself that this great trial might be made to end well for him, leading him on to be better in this life and happy in the next. And, naturally enough, the more she prayed for him, the purer and nobler he seemed to her, and the worthier of her liking. It was just after one of these entangling orisons in behalf of the young man that she met him again. Edward could not long stay away from the house in which he had been arraigned, condemned, and sentenced. It seemed to have some such sad and angry attraction for him as the scene of a murder is said to have for the ghost of the murdered one. In his vindictive desperation he craved to revisit Sea Lodge, there to scowl defiance at his calamity and the man who had inflicted it. âI will face my uncle down,â he said to himself. âI will show him that I care not one straw for his money; that I can bear all he can lay upon me without flinching.â But another sentiment, even stronger perhaps than wrath, drew him to the spot. He longed greatly to see Nestoria; for since his outlawry by his own blood, he had thought of her more than ever; he had set her up in this alluring light, that she was the only friend he had left on earth; and he looked forward to an interview with her as a support and consolation. Not that he might make love to her, and much less ask for her in marriage. No, no; he was too poor now to offer himself even to a chambermaid; and he said to himself over and over again that this dear little beauty deserved all the tendernesses of fortune. Such at least was his general feeling, the judgment of his moments of highest wisdom. But there were other times when the hopefulness of youth and the stirring of the blood demanded, âWhy not?â This simple, unworldly, unselfish child would surely have the nobility to love him in spite of penury, and the faith to wait for him until he could acquire the means to support her. With a seraph to labor for, he would labor better than for himself alone, and scale the summit of success more quickly. âPerhaps,â he murmured to himself in these enchanted moments, âperhaps it would be well for us both.â Only three days after the quarrel, this wild-headed and hot-hearted youth stalked haughtily into the castle of that grim enchanter, one wave of whose wand had stripped him of his golden expectations and left him clothed in insolvency. He was ready to do instant battle, no doubt of some unwise and calamitous sort, the moment he should meet his enemy. But he had scarcely entered the plainly-furnished parlor ere the Luciferian wrath and defiance faded from his brow. He beheld the innocent sweet face and radiant golden hair of Nestoria. The girl smiled brightly; she had, by the way, a habit of welcoming her friends by merely smiling; it was one of her unconscious fascinations. âYou are a burst of sunshine,â he said. âYou light up the whole of this doleful house.â âI am glad you have come,â she replied, apparently accepting his compliment as a mere expression of friendship, and perhaps so accepting it because she was accustomed to the superlatives of the East. âI saw your boat in the harbor, dodging about like one of the sea-birds, and wondered if it would stop here. Take this great chair,â she added, dragging it toward him in a helpful way which was common with her. âYou will have nobody but me to talk with. Mrs. Dinneford has gone to town to do the marketing, and Alice is driving with the Judge.â âI am glad they are out,â smiled Edward, pleased to be alone with her, and forgetting his enemy. Nestoria glanced at him with a troubled air, innocently wondering why he was glad, and whether she might ask why. Affectionately anxious about him, and unable to suppose that a man would lightly express himself pleased to be rid of his relations, she suspected that the quarrel between uncle and nephew had fared from bad to worse. Her childlike face, as incapable of concealments as the physiognomy of perfect innocence always is, revealed the discomfort of her thoughts. âWhat makes you look so sad?â he asked. âBecause I don't care to have my relations always in my lap?â âIt isn't that,â she said. âThough that seems to me soâstrange! I don't know that I ought to tell you what I was worrying about. And yetâI willâ I must. You needn't answer my question if it is an improper one.â âWhat is it?â he inquired, as she again hesitated. âIs it about the difficulty with my uncle?â âYes,â whispered Nestoria, so terrible was the subject to her, and so breathless her interest in it. âWe are on speaking terms now, but I am to have none of his property,â he stated dryly and plainly, feeling that such a tale of calamity and injustice required no garnish of rhetoric or elocution. âOh!â exclaimed Nestoria, looking entirely relieved and even happy, it was so much better than she had feared. âYou seem pleased,â he commented with a sort of peevish surprise, closely bordering on vexation. âI am pleased because you are on speaking terms,â was her answer. âI could not bear to have two such kind friends of mine hold apart from each other.â âYou must not misunderstand me,â he went on with creditable frankness. âWe are not on genial speaking terms. Not much geniality in my uncle when people don't agree with him. I think he is hard, and he means to be hard.â âDoes he?â sighed Nestoria. âI don't see how it can be so, he seems so just. But you know far more of this matter than I do. I know almost nothing. At any rate, if you see each other often, perhaps the trouble will wear away.â âLittle chance of it,â he muttered. âAnd meanwhile I haven't a cent in the world.â He made this confession in such a drooping, desperate tone, that the girl could not but perceive that here was a great misfortune, at least in his opinion. âI am so sorry!â she said heartily, at the same time looking at him with profound pity, though wondering how he could be thus depressed by mere poverty. Then her face brightened, partly with her natural cheerfulness, and partly with a desire to console him, and she added smiling, âWell, we have the same destiny. We must both work for a living. I am going to teach school and paint fans.â âAnd so will I work!â exclaimed Edward, thoroughly ashamed of his cowardice and sense of helplessness. He sprang to his feet and walked the room with a resolute step, repeating, âYes, I will work. I'll work like a Trojan.â Nestoria gazed at him with admiration, fully believing in his manliness and feeling a humble awe of it. Of a sudden he became in her eyes something more than charming; he rose in one instant to be noble, heroic, and worshipful; and in that instant she loved him. Gentleness is fascinating to a woman, but strength is subduing. Nestoria had seen Edward courteous, and she had given him her earnest friendship; now she saw him, as she thought, virile and mighty, and with a single throb she gave him her heart. He did indeed look noble, for the loftiness of worthy resolve was in his air, and the beautiful confidence of young and healthy manhood in his face. It seemed to him at the moment that he would indeed labor terribly, that he would deserve a success which should command the respect of his fellow creatures, and that he would (most bewitching thought of all) rise superior to that enemy, his uncle. Presently he glanced at Nestoria, and the instant his eyes met hers he was fascinated, for in their sincere azure he beheld her heart. The undisguisable sympathy and affection of that innocent gaze threw down all the battlements of his prudence as easily as the sunlight eats up the minutest drop of dew. The dandy, the practised beau, the worldling who supposed himself to be superbly selfish, the man-about-town who trusted that he was hardened, became in one breath a reckless lover. âMy dear little friend, how good you are!â he said, walking straight up to her, and bending over her with brooding tenderness. âYou do really care for my welfare.â Nestoria could not reply; her heart was all at once full of terror; her voice was suffocated by pulsations. She rose to her feet with difficulty, feeling that she ought to run away, but unable to go. âMy dear, dear child, I must love you,â he went on, impelled by that headlong eagerness of his which made him always do what he wanted to do, regardless of consequences. âWill you let me? I am unworthy of it. But do let me. Do let me hope that some day you will love me in return.â By this time he had taken her hand, and we are compelled to confess that Nestoria was not wise enough to withdraw it, and indeed did not think of withdrawing it. She had lost all control of her destiny, and although she was crying a little, it was with happiness. âOh! what are you crying for?â be asked, prodigiously troubled by the sight of a tear on her cheek, for the tenderness of deep affection possessed him. âAm I vexing youâpaining you?â She looked up in his face with such an expression of content and joy that he could not possibly mistake her feelings. âYou surprise me so!â she whispered. âI didn't expect this. I didn't knowââ âThen you will promise to wait for me?â he urged, eager for a complete answer, an unmistakable word. âBut, Edward,â she said, hesitating, âI want to ask you one question.â âWhat is it, Nestoria?â She put her mouth close to his ear and whispered her query so low that he could scarcely hear it. The shy, yet anxious and solemn interrogatory was, whether he were a member of the church of Christ. He stared at her. A grave look come over his face. At last he said, âI am.â âOh!â she sighed, relieved from a great terror. âI will wait all my life for you.â We will describe this interview no further; indeed, it only lasted a minute longer. Glancing accidentally out of a window, Edward saw Judge Wetherel drive up to the gate, too late to prevent a scene which, as we can easily understand, might well be the first act in the drama of trouble. âThere is my uncle,â he said, releasing Nestoria's hand. âI must tell him this at once.â In his heart he added, with some anxiety as well as with some triumph, âHow will he take it?â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. JUDGE WETHEREL DISSENTS. Judge Wetherel entered the parlor in his usual deliberate fashion, walking with some such sluggishness as if his boots were weightier than himself, or as if he were one of those sufferers whom Dante saw toiling through the Infer no in garments of lead. So imperfect was his eyesight, that he did not at first recognize his nephew and Nestoria as they stood up before him side by side, the girl tenderly pale and swaying like a lily on its stalk, while the young man, though flushed even to dizziness, was resolute and almost defiant. But the moment he discerned who they were, he seemed to divine that something unusual had happened, and coming to a halt he gazed at them silently and fixedly. Behind him appeared Alice, equally speechless and curious, a little disturbed, too, at the sight of Edward, for she instantly remembered the will which enriched her to his impoverishment. In the midst of this crisis of suspense, Mrs. Dinneford also entered the room, cheerfully fresh and brisk from her errands in the city, but struck suddenly dumb by the tableau before her. âUncle, I have something to tell you,â spoke out Edward, surely a young man of some moral stamina, whether for good or evil. âI have offered myself to Miss Bernard, and she has accepted me.â Judge Wetherel seemed to be stunned; for many seconds he preserved a perfect silence, staring glassily into vacancy; at last he slowly enunciated, in a voice more than usually thin and ghostly, âWhatâdoesâthisâmean?â Presently he resumed, his sunken face blank with sorrowful amazement, âIs the eye of innocence really so blind?â After another pause he added, âI have neglected my duty. I must neglect it no longer.â A wave of his sallow, shrivelled hand dismissed Mrs. Dinneford and Alice from the parlor. They did not want to go; their womanly hearts were eager to stay and help fight the battle of the two lovers; but that hand was as authoritative as the flaming sword which guarded the gate of Eden. Considering the amiable though perhaps misjudging kindliness of the feelings by which they were moved, we must pardon them for lingering in the neighboring hall and tampering with the fidelity of the keyhole. The Judge turned his eyes upon the Adam and Eve whom he was about to expel from the paradise into which they had just stolen. Some men in his position would have faltered, out of mere unreasoning pity and sympathy; or would have decided feebly that it was too late now to interfere, and that things must take their course. But this man had abundance of iron in his clay; he was braced up on the one hand by his solemn sense of duty, and on the other oy his long experience in laying the penalties of the law upon his fellow creatures; and between such an Aaron and such a Hur he had no inclination and even no power to falter. He did not see before him two loving souls who would be wretched if they were divided; he only saw a bewildered victim who must be saved, and a godless tempter who must be exorcised. âEdward, you have abused my hospitality,â he began in the impressive tone of one who knows that he is pronouncing just sentence. âYou have violated the sanctuary of my house. Because I have permitted you to come hither in the hope that it might somehow result in your own good, you have come to work mischief for others. A mere worldling, a man who has no part nor lot with the righteous, you are not worthy to be the companion of this innocent infant. Instead of being a comfort and a guide to her, you would be a thorn and a stumbling-block.â We can imagine the amazement and horror with which Nestoria listened to this speech. Having learned to believe in Judge Wetherel, having accepted his character as perfect and his motives as pure and his opinions as wise, she was disposed to receive all his words as infallible revelations; so that her first impulse now, as she watched his persuaded face and listened to his solemn voice, was to credit every syllable of his accusation. She turned such a stare upon Edward as if she had heard him convicted of murder or of atheism. But then came a revulsion; this man, too, she had been brought to regard as altogether lovely and of good report; the illusions of a love which was all innocence had clothed him in her eyes with innocence. In an instant her confidence leaped toward him again, and she deemed that he was judged harshly if not wrongfully. These vacillations of belief and of feeling were too much for her strength; and with a dizzy consciousness that she had turned very white, she sat down. Edward, meanwhile, was in a state of simple fury, no doubt justifiable enough in his opinion, though he did not stop to analyze it. âI suppose it gives you pleasure to cause all this misery,â he said, looking straight in his uncle's face. âIt gives me unspeakable grief,â replied the Judge, his eyes fixed upon Nestoria. âThis is the very wretchedest moment that you have ever caused me.â His voice shook a good deal here, and he paused until he could reÃ«stablish it. âEdward,â he resumed, âI cannot talk to you, nor in your presence. I must beg you to leave.â The young man did not stir; he simply gazed at Nestoria. âI must insist upon your leaving me,â continued the old gentleman in a louder tone. âThis lady is my guest, and in a manner my ward. This is my house, sir. I know my legal rights. Will you recognize them or not?â âYes,â answered Edward, choking with rage. âI came here with your permission, but I will go at your order. Understand this, however, that I am betrothed to this lady, and that I have a right to meet her otherwheres. Nestoria, I must go now,â he added, turning to the girl. âBut I will see you again. I will write. Don't be my enemy. Can't you answer me?â If we have given the impression hitherto that Nestoria was deficient in moral and intellectual force, we have done her injustice. Little as she was, and childlike in appearance, and ignorant of what people call the world, she had, perhaps, more character than most girls of her age, and under the spur of necessity could summon up notable self-possession and bravery. Notwithstanding her present great fright and unprecedented trouble, she found now just the right word to impose upon these two exasperated men, and to bring this woful scene to a close. âAll this must go before my father, Edward,â she said with quiet firmness, though she seemed to herself to be speaking out of some horrible, hopeless abyss. âOf course, you knew all the while that he must decide.â âYes, he must decide,â conceded Judge Wetherel, always and instantly subordinate to authorities which the law recognizes. âI must ask you to wait, Edward,â she continued. âCan't you wait for me? I was willing and am willing to wait for you.â The young man took her hand and bowed over it with the humble worship of a lover who has no present chance to boast great things of himself, and who discovers in the object of his affection moral qualities which can make his happiness. For the first time this charming child appeared to him not merely beautiful, but also august. It was for her sake alone that he turned to his uncle before he left the room and uttered some civil words of farewell. âGood-morning, sir,â ceremoniously replied the old gentleman. He had meant to say that for the present there must be no writing between them; but in the worry and hurry of the ugly occasion he entirely forgot that bit of duty. His physical weakness asserted itself as soon as Edward had departed, and he sat down suddenly with an air of utter exhaustion, tremulous decadence, and pallid decay, so that a person of vivid fancy might almost have looked to see him collapse and crumble into dust. Nestoria brought him a glass of water, and he swallowed with shaking eagerness, as a drunkard would have gulped brandy. âOh, how I have troubled you!â whispered this unselfish child. âMy dear, what will your father say to this?â was his answer. âWhat will Doctor Bernard think of me?â âIs not Edward a member of the church?â asked Nestoria. The Judge stared at her without responding; the question seemed to perplex and silence him. âHe told me so,â she added, trembling with anxiety. âI believe he is,â at last answered the Judge, and fell back into speechlessness. Let us inquire for ourselves what the young man had meant and how much he had meant when he made this statement to the girl. He had told the simple truth; it was a fact that he had passed through the ceremony of confirmation at an early age; he could still remember with a smile his sensations of awe under the pressure of episcopal hands. But that was all, for the scene had exercised no influence over his life, and he had always considered it a mere form. At the same time he did not mean to deceive Nestoria. Much as he liked her, and much as he had sought to divine her nature, he did not really understand her. The urgency of her devotional sentiments was as far beyond his perceptions as if he had been a monkey; and indeed he could not have imagined, without assistance, that any girl would accept or decline marriage because of religious scruples. In short, church membership was to him a simple decorum, a matter of etiquette and deportment and breeding, which some people thought urgent and others not. Ruled by these ideas, he had stared in surprise at Nestoria's unexpected query, and had answered it with straightforward, simple directness, confining himself to the bare fact of the case. We must add in his favor that at the same time he felt an impulse, perhaps transitory enough in its character, to become more worthy of his decorous profession than he had been, and at all events more worthy of this angelic catechist. Let us return now to the interview between the Judge and Nestoria. The old man was singularly perplexed; as was natural, he did not like to blacken the name of one who was both a representative of his family, and even in some outward manner of his faith; and between his conscientious tenderness and his conscientious severity he vacillated long. âDid you question him concerning this matter?â he finally asked. âYesâ said Nestoria. âIt was well,â bowed the Judge. âDid he tell you any more than the simple fact? Did he claim to be worthy of his high title?â âNo,â said Nestoria. âAre we any of us worthy?â âNone of us,â answered the old man. âBut there are some who seek to be so, and others who seek not. I fearâyes, I will honestly say that I believe that Edward is of these last.â Nestoria's eyes filled with tears, and she laid her head suddenly on a table hiding her face with her hands. âAre you sure that he will not change?â she presently asked, without looking up. âThe mercy of God is especially for the chief of sinners,â responded the Judge, his self-command giving way at last, and his voice breaking into a sob. âMy child, we will both of us pray and labor for this man,â he resumed after a struggle. âPeradventure Heaven will hear us. These chastisements, and this new desire of his may work for his good. We will not despair of him. I have despaired, but a vision seems to tell me now that I was wrong, and that I must let patience and hope have their perfect work. As for what concerns you, we will leave all with your father. We must wait. It is every way a necessity. Edward has no property and no profession. He must find some means of existence before he can take one step forward.â âSo he told me,â said Nestoria, glad that she could show forth Edward's veracity and frankness. âPerhaps I have done him injustice,â muttered the old man. He said it to himself, but the gentle doubt was not lost upon the girl, and she left the room almost happy, so cheering and deluding is love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. A COUNT'S PHILOSOPHIZINGS. WHO among us, that remembers distinctly his or her salad days, dare affirm that youth is wise enough for its needs? The youthfulness of Edward Wetherel was certainly not ballasted with sufficing wisdom. A patient escaped from a lunatic asylum could hardly do worse than waste all his money, spurn an easy chance of obtaining a gratuitous million, and then offer himself to a girl without a penny. So much, we may monitorially add in passing, for indulging a headstrong will and a greedy taste for pleasures. Excellent characteristics are the impulses, when intelligently directedâcapable of making a man nobly virile in himself and a benefactor of his fellows; but, while praiseworthily useful as servants, ruinous as masters. Notwithstanding all his obvious blunders and the calamities which had so frankly issued out of them, Edward still could not learn to put a bridle upon his impetuous and obstinate disposition. He left his uncle's house as pugnacious, as determined to have his own will, and as eager to gratify his emotions, as if he had always been the luckiest of mortals. As he put back across the harbor to his lodging-place, he kept all sail up in defiance of a stiff breeze and heavy sea, taking a desperate satisfaction in running the risk of drowning. The plunge of his light boat into the curling heads of foam gratified him; it seemed to him as if he were striking opponents and enemies in the face. Landing in a half-soaked condition, he joined his two fellow-lodgers in a smoke, and refused to change his clothes. âByronic,â scoffed Wolverton, with kindly intentions. âYou will out-grow that sort of thing some of these days.â âI believe that I am a real man enough, as far as I go,â answered Edward. âThat is very true,â admitted Wolverton, who liked the youngster, and thought him on the whole a superior fellow. âI don't mean that you habitually exult in sorrow, and don't charge you at all with putting on a fancy-ball melancholy. But for all your sincerity, you had better dry yourself. Rheumatism doesn't help matters.â âOh, let me alone awhile,â sulked Edward. âWe must not laugh at the world-sorrow,â put in the Count, who had heard the above conversation with disapproval, both as a philosopher and as a literary critic. âYou practical Anglo-Saxons delight to laugh at it; you call great Byron humbug because he felt it and sang it. But you are wrong. The world-sorrow is a true and beautiful emotion. I cannot boast of it; but I respect it. The illimitable Shakespeare divined and described it. The melancholy of Hamlet comes not altogether from his troubles; it is partly world-sorrow. When we behold that great drama from this one of its many sides, we see that Hamlet was in part a prophecy of Rousseau and Byron. There is nothing great in the sentimental cosmos that the illimitable Shakespeare has not foretold or recounted. He knew the past and the future, the fact and the possibility of the man-soul; and he, the all-enfolding, the highest known intellect, speaks not contemptuously of the world-sorrow.â The Count was neither talking to show off his erudition, nor to hear the sound of his own voice. He had risen to his feet to make his remarks, and he uttered them in a manner of unmistakable earnestness, gesturing the while with his lighted cigar, and glancing from face to face of his auditors. Meantime the two Americans stared at him with what they considered a suitable mixture of candid contempt and wonder. âPoloski, you puzzle me,â said Wolverton fraukly. âYou are a flÃ¢neur like myself, and yet you are a philosopher and a linguist. I don't see how you mix such opposite fancies.â The Count's lip curled slightly, and, notwithstanding his habitual civility, he had an air for one moment of despising his companions. âWhy should not a flÃ¢neur be also a great man?â he asked. âCÃ¦sar was a dandy. You Americans are not many-sided enough. It is not that you have not brains individually. It is the defect of your intellectual atmosphere. There is in it no variety of culture. It is not so in Europe. Look at meâwhat you call a dandyâI know seven languages, and have written brochures on them all, and now I am preparing a great work on the Origins of Speech.â âHonest?â asked Wetherel, looking up from his brooding, and thinking in a practical way that if he knew as much as Poloski, he too would write a great work and make money (as learned men always do), and so have funds to marry on. âHonest!â repeated the Count in high dudgeon. âHave you thought me a humbug? I could show you all my brochures, only for my misfortunes. A robber of a hotel-keeper seized my baggage and sold it to pay his rascally little bill. All my writings were lost!â he sighed with indisputable grief. âMy Origins of Speech is only begun. But I will show you some dayâI will show you!â Can we believe the Count? Yes, we must in some measure credit his statements; he was really a linguist, and, to a certain extent, a scholar. A native of Posen (it is supposed), Polish and German were mother tongues to him, and he had acquired more or less knowledge of several other languages. As to the various queer essays of which he boasted, we have no report concerning them but his own; and as to his having read them before royal and imperial societies, respectful doubt is at least permissible. His work, however, on the Origins of Speech was not a myth; and fragments of it did eventually astonish and delude superficial pundits. âWell, you are too deep for us,â confessed Wolverton, with lazy modesty âI can't discuss philology with you. And here is Wetherel going uncomforted.â âLet him study the science of language, and he will be comforted,â de clared the Count. âWhat is the matter with Wetherel?â âI am the victim of rich relatives,â said Edward, with a bitter attempt at defiant gayety. âMy uncle has robbed me of his fortune.â âIs he rich, your uncle?â asked Poloski, deeply interested, as he always was at the mention of wealth. âWorth a million,â sulkily responded Edward, remembering that he would have none of it. âWhat!â exclaimed the Count. âAnd lives in that little house? He should have a castle. Of course he is not imprudent enough to keep much money in that coop.â âRolls in a bin of it every night,â asserted Edward. âDon't you wish he played poker?â âWhy have you not taken me there again?â asked Poloski. âI wanted once moreâwith your permissionâto see the charming Miss Alice.â âI have piloted you over twice, my Leander.â âTrue. I am under infinite obligations. But the second time we found not the young ladies, and you would not introduce me to the house.â âNever mind, Count. No disrespect intended. I have scarcely been allowed to introduce myself.â âAnd have you been really disinherited?â âYes,â laughed Edward, with what joy in the merriment we can imagine. âThe monster!â said the Count. âIt is a case far worse than world-sorrow.â After remaining for some time in meditation, he added, âThen you will not go there more?â âNo,â returned Edward. That very day the noble Poloski took his departure, explaining that he had urgent affairs in New York. âYou won't play with him,â suggested Edward to Wolverton; âand he takes it for granted that I haven't much more to lose.â âI don't think that is the whole of it,â returned Wolverton. âThe dead-beat was after your cousin Alice; but of course, if you are not going over there, he has lost his chance of getting a footing in the family; and he isn't the fellow to waste his time in sighing across a harbor. We shall hear of him courting some other girl's bank account. I'm glad he's gone. Hadn't we better go too?â âI will go on to New Haven with you,â said Wetherel. âWhy not to Newport?â âI can't afford it. I must save my moneyâor rather your money. Can't I make you understand that I am dished and must study a profession?â he added irritably. âI'll go to New Haven and pick out my boarding-house there and get used to it. I must be a sawbones. It is the only business that I take the least fancy to. And I may as well study in New Haven as anywhere else.â âBetter,â added Wolverton. âYou will be near your uncle, and luck may bring the old man around, if he sees you now and then. New Haven is just the place for you,â he declared, viewing Wetherel's gloomy prospects cheerfully, as the kindest of us are apt to view the burdens of our fellows. âWell, suppose we quit here on Saturday. I'll stop over with you a day or two in New Haven, and see you settled. Any money that you want, you know, just call on me. I can't help thinking that this affair will come around all right yet.â âPerhaps so,â grumbled Edward. âI can't feel so confident as you can. Perhaps because the troubles are mine, instead of yours. However, I'm greatly obliged to you. We will start when you say.â Thus it was that the young man came to be still in the neighborhood of Sea Lodge when the bloody footstep of the âWetherel Mysteryâ appeared on its threshold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. ANOTHER LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT. The Wetherel household, habitually in a state of twilight seriousness, had descended into a still lower and more darkling atmosphere, as if the shadow of the oncoming tragedy were already stealing over it. Every member of the family was occupied with sorrowful meditations and exercises concerning the luckless drama of Nestoria and Edward. The girl herself was of course in a state of worry about her lover; sometimes believing that he was good, and even very good, and at all events too good for her; sometimes fearing lest she should discover him to be one of those with whom conscientious spirits must not hold companionship. She made no public moan, indeed, being too modest to parade her griefs and too self-sustaining to lay them on the shoulders of others; but her cheek had faded a little, and her eyes had lost somewhat of their lucid brightness, so that her watchful friends knew that she wept in secret. Mrs. Dinneford and Alice sorrowed for her, though not without hope, for they were women of the good old womanly sort, who held in the main that a love affair must have a blessed ending. The Judge appeared outwardly more shaken than anybody else; his habitual solemnity had degenerated into an absent-minded anxiety, his face unusually wan and his step forbodingly feeble. âUncle is more than half sick,â observed Alice to her mother. âAnd I am glad of it. He is too hard to put up with.â âHush, my child,â returned Mrs. Dinneford. âCousin Wetherel looks at everything through his sense of duty. Edward has certainly been a wild boy; and I dare say he might make a very bad use of the property, if he should get it; and I sometimes must think of him in Tupper's wonderful words, `Behold, the simple did sow and hath reaped the right harvest of folly'; and as for his marrying Nestoria, he might make her dreadfully unhappy, you know, though I'm sure I hope not; and finally, how in the world could he possibly support her? Why, the poor child might have to go to teaching school and painting her fans to keep him out of the poorhouse. Dear me, when I think of it all I feel that we ought to be angry with Edward instead of with Cousin Wetherel, though nature inclines the other way. Young men are so attractive!â âIt is a horrid muddle,â fretted Alice. âWhy wasn't Nestoria warned?â she added, quite forgetting her own responsibility in the matter. âHere you knew, you venerable people, that Edward was a flibbertigibbet, and never told her.â âWho could have guessed how things were going?â groaned the elder woman. âThe ways of Providence are dreadfully mysterious; too much so for some of us poor mortals. I sometimes think they were laid out without the least regard to us. We are left to look out for ourselves just as much as if we were rats and puppies, with a lot of Chinamen going to and fro to make pies of us. If we can keep out of the way, very good; and if we can't, we are devoured, and that's the end of it.â âDon't bring Providence into the squabble,â protested Alice. âThe whole fault of the present muss lies with Uncle Wetherel. He could clear up matters if he wanted to. He ought to settle a hundred thousand dollars on them, and tie up the money so that Edward couldn't spend it, and let them be married. They would get along as well as half the people. Somebody says that reformed rakes make the best husbands.â âPerhaps soâif they ever do reform.â And Mrs. Dinneford shook her head seriously, for Alice was a little too much given to favoring rakes. During two days the only complaint which Nestoria uttered concerning her troubles was a confession that Sea Lodge had become a sad place to her. âI cannot stay here much longer,â she sighed. âI love you all, but I must go.â âOh, no!â implored Mrs. Dinneford. âNot yet awhile. Stay with us till the vacations are over. There is no sense in your going till you have got a place.â And Alice added, with the headlong fervor of youthful friendship. âThere is no sense in your going ever.â âDo help me then to find a place,â was Nestoria's piteous answer. Let us inquire a little more minutely than we have hitherto done into this extravagant mystery of the affection of a pure and conscientious soul for one whom Judge Wetherel numbered not unfairly among the sons of Belial. Serious people will be ready to affirm that a thoroughly good girl cannot trust and admire and love a bad man. In a general way this is true; the saintly do not incline toward the openly corrupt; they instinctively dislike and avoid them. But we must remember that when the wolves put on sheep's clothing, they often enter the fold without difficulty and are well received among the flock. Now, as far as Nestoria had seen or could perceive, Edward Wetherel was vestured in the very purest and whitest of lambs' wool, such as might have served for the covering of a prophet or high priest. As gentle and courteous as any missionary, and in her hearing as becoming in conversation, she classed him with the worthy souls among whom she had been educated, and could not possibly think of him as on a par with the heathen. The mere fact that he wore European clothing was a certificate of good character in the eyes of a child who had rarely seen a wicked man without a turban, loose robes, and a shawl full of firearms. It might seem that she had received warnings and hints enough concerning Edward to make her comprehend clearly that he was a scapegrace. But innocence is very dull in the matter of understanding insinuations as to evil. It has sometimes occurred to me that the angels who abide permanently in heaven must be exceedingly incredulous and hard to instruct concerning the wickedness of our planet. Difficult as the thing is to accept, we must be contented to receive it as a fact (and it seems to me a fact of great beauty and pathos) that Nestoria had not comprehended much of what the Judge had said to her against his nephew. The two men had disagreed, and that certainly was a very lamentable business; but which was darkly to blame she could not tell, and she charitably, sweetly hoped, neither. Well, what must she do? Of course she must eventually leave all with her father, that entirely wise and good being, that representative to her of Deity. But meantime was she to hear and see nothing of Edward? It was improbable that he would come again to his uncle's house; and after bearing his absence for a day or two, she could not help writing to him. âMy dear, dear friend,â she began, âwhat shall I say to you? We must wait, and you must have patience; can't you? I hope and believe that you trust me, notwithstanding that you cannot see me. You may confide in me thoroughly. I have thought this matter all over, and, my dear, dear friend, I have prayed over it, and it seems to me that I have received some light upon it. When I remember how we were allowed to meet, and to learn to believe in each other, until it was too late to disbelieve, it seems to me that we were led by a mighty hand, a hand reaching from the other world. I think so with frequent trembling, and yet with prevailing cheerfulness. And so I shall keep my promise to you, in spite of your good uncle's warning. My dear, dear friend, the friend that has come nearest to my heart of any on earth, if you have not been always a good man heretofore, you must be a good man henceforward for my sake, as well as for far greater motives. I will not write any more, for perhaps I ought not. But I could not help writing this. What I have to ask you, then, is to have patience until we can hear from my father. Is it too much? âYours always, âNestoria.â This letter she showed to Mrs. Dinneford, who read it with moist eyes âand sent it. âIf the Lord,â said the good lady to herself, âif the Lord doesn't take care of that child, I don't know whom he will take care of. And if Edward doesn't turn a sharp corner now and make a decent man of himself, he ought to beâ hung! I wish I could lock him up. We put dumb creatures into yokes and pokes when they are unruly. Edward is just as fit to run about alone as a truant goose or a hooking cow. And here I can't blow a warning trumpet against him in this poor child's ear, for fear of worrying her. I never had anybody take such a hold of my feelings. Well, there is one comfort in it, she may have got the same hold of Edward.â I suspect that most of us are like Mrs. Dinneford in finding it difficult to deal faithfully with pretty and agreeable persons. Indeed, it strikes one as a general reflection of much weight, that Providence has been kind to the human race in making many plain women. If all the representatives of that exacting sex were beautiful and captivating, men would hardly ever be masters of their own minds and actions; they would be constantly on the go to please some irresistible charmer, and they would have neither thought nor time for the virile labors of life, so that politics, business, and possibly civilization altogether, would march haltingly, if indeed we did not remain in a state of figleaves. Judge Wetherel himself, that incarnate case of conscience, who was accustomed to denounce beauty as a delusion and a share, was spiritually benumbed to an amazing extent by Nestoria's graces. It was mainly because her sweet smile and golden hair reminded him of seraphs that he could not warn her frankly that she had thrown her pearls of affection before the unclean, and command her strenously to withdraw the precious offering. At last it was borne in upon him that, if his nephew was to be this child's detriment, he ought to be her salvation, at least in a worldly sense; and thus he came to conceive the idea of leaving her fifty thousand dollars or so, the said legacy to be secured to her by a trusteeship, so that her husband might not waste it. This generous plan he in fact decided upon. During the evening he commenced drawing up a new will. He was so eager about it that, instead of going to bed at nine o'clock, according to his prudent custom, he sat in his study until long afterward, slowly tracing out his good deed in his large, formal, conscientious handwriting. At half past ten he was still busy, for both mind and hand were somewhat stiffened by age, and he could only work slowly. One by one the others retired, leaving him alone with his benevolence. âCousin Wetherel, take care of your eyes,â said Mrs. Dinneford, entering the study to bid him good-night. âYou can't labor as you could once.â âDo not interrupt me,â replied the old man. âI must do with my might what my hand findeth to do. The night cometh when no man can work.â âBut the morning cometh also,â observed Mrs. Dinneford, who was accustomed to talk with her relative in his own Biblical way. âWe know not the plans of Providence,â said the Judge. âI have always endeavored to labor as if each day were to be my last. Suffer me to go on.â âYou are altering your will!â exclaimed the good lady, her large blue eyes opening so wide with delight that her spectacles were a very close fit. âCousin Wetherel, I am rejoiced. I do hope poor Edward is to have something to keep him off the town.â âA pretty reason for giving a man wealth because he is of the almshouse sort!â grumbled the old gentleman, a shrewd economist and financier, be it observed, and necessarily somewhat scornful of those who were not. âCousin Dinneford,â he added, in a humorously pettish tone, âif you cannot sleep without learning what I am doing, be it known to you that I am bequeathing a support to this damsel who has found her sojourn under my roof such a pitfall to her feet.â âNestoria!â fairly laughed Mrs. Dinneford. âCousin Wetherel, the Lord speed you! I won't delay you another minute. Do finish it and sign it.â âThere must be witnesses,â answered the Judge. âAnd we have none here of a proper status. To-morrow, if Providence permit, all shall be done in order and with punctuality.â âWell, to-morrow,â smiled Mrs. Dinneford. âGood-night. Cousin Wetherel.â She hastened up stairs, looked in upon Alice to tell her the good news, found the girl asleep, and went to her own room. The house fell silent. Only in the Judge's study, situated, we must remember, upon the ground floor, was there a light burning. After a time this too disappeared; the mystery of a night without moon or stars settled upon the dwelling; there was a darkness such as they love whose deeds are evil.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. THE MURDER. No sound had disturbed any sleeper in Sea Lodge with the revelation or with so much as the suggestion of a tragedy. And yet a stroke of deadly violence, as cruel and conclusive as the crunch of a headsman's axe, had fallen; and in one of the rooms of this summer pleasure-house a corpse watched with wide-open, glassy eyes for the morning. During all the latter hours of the night it stared into the darkness, utterly unknown and unsuspected to the living who were so near it, so that it seemed to be lying in wait to surprise and shock and terrify them, and this too although it wore the guise of one who had loved them. From certain points of view there is something vampire-like, something uncomfortably hostile and ferocious, in a dead body. To the living, so far at least as concerns their continuance in physical life, it is a menace and a prophet of evil. The victim was not Mrs. Dinneford; she had slept that slumber from which we wake. But some oppressive thing in the air of the house, some subtle influence which was unfriendly to prolonged repose, aroused her at an unusually early hour; and unable to close her eyes again, she got up and dressed herself hastily, meaning to go out and breathe the refreshment of dawn. First, however, she peeped into her daughter's room, as was her motherly custom of mornings, to see if the girl slept well. Next, the doors of the sleeping apartments being all open on account of the summer heat, she went softly to take a like kindly glance at Nestoria. To her astonishment she found the room of the guest empty and the bed undisturbed. Alarmed at once (tender-hearted women are so easily anxious), she hurried to a window, peered out in all directions, and called, first gently and then louder, âNestoria!â No answer came from within or without; and Mrs. Dinneford, throbbing with agitation, ran down stairs to continue her search; fearful goblins of suspicion meanwhile following her fast with such queries as, Sickness? Insanity? Edward? Had the dear child been taken suddenly and dangerously ill? Had her perplexities unsettled her mind and sent her out wandering? Had the headlong and ill-starred Edward so far abused her inexperience and innocence as to draw her into an elopement? Mrs. Dinneford could think of no other explanations for this extraordinary disappearance. On reaching the lower floor of the still quiet and silent cottage, it occurred to her that she would do well to awaken the Judge and inform him of what had happened. But in passing through the parlor on the way to his bedroom she chanced to look into the study, and there, to her amazement, she beheld her venerable kinsman seated in his office chair. His back was toward her, his body leaning forward, his arms and head resting upon his writing-table, his silver hair hanging loosely about his face, and his whole attitude that of deep slumber. âWhy, Cousin Wetherel!â exclaimed, or rather screamed Mrs. Dinneford. âHave you been here all night?â The Judge did not stir; his sleep was awfully, alarmingly profound; and of a sudden the wondering woman became tremulous with fright. Was it a fainting fit, or was it apoplexy? Forgetting all about Nestoria, she advanced hastily to the old man and laid her hand upon his shoulder. In the next instant she snatched it away and shrieked with all her strength, âMurder!â The terrible cry awakened or startled all the members of the family, and brought them one by one into the room, flurried, amazed, and staring. The first living person of whom Mrs. Dinneford became aware was the gardener, a quiet, silent, and somewhat stolid man, of the lowly-born English type. âOh, James, he has been killed! see the blood!â hurriedly and mechanically gasped the horror-stricken woman. James advanced to the unmoving body, surveyed with profound solemnity a large crimson, clotted pool on the writing-table, passed an unflinching horny hand over a white, cold face, and touched with one finger a gash in the hoary crown. There was no question about the remorseless completeness of the sanguinary work. The severe and somewhat sunless, but conscientious, benevolent, and on the whole beautiful life had ended; and the sincere spirit of the old man, purified through worthy work and worthier aspirations, had risen by mortal violence to divine mercy. Having completed his rude diagnosis, James fell back with some brief and simple remark, the exact phraseology of which Mrs. Dinneford did not note at the time, merely gathering that the Judge was quite dead. Now came the cook, the chambermaid, and lastly Alice. There were four frightened, weeping, and more or less hysterical women together, supported by only one ignorant, lumpish, and every way inadequate man. Under the spur of necessity Mrs. Dinneford suppressed her own faintings of spirit, and gave such directions as were given. She sent the chambermaid to summon the nearest neighbors, and the gardener to search the earth around the house for strange foot-tracks. When the cook proposed to remove the Judge to his bedroom, âand lay him out decently before he stiffened,â she called to mind in a vague way that there must be legal examinations, and ordered with excited sharpness, âDon't touch him, and don't touch anything.â Meantime she was endeavoring to comfort and tranquillize her daughter. Alice was almost irrational with fright and horror; her jaws quivered so that she could not articulate with distinctness, yet she talked incessantly. She asked a hundred questions, and asked them over and over again. âOh, mother, did he breathe?â she chattered. âOh, didn't he breathe just once? Was he all gone when you came in? Don't you suppose he knew you were there when you touched him? Don't you suppose he was just a little conscious? Oh, so sudden! it's worse than the blood, isn't it, mother? Do you think he saw them when they struck him? Do you think he knew they were going to kill him? I hope he didn't know it and didn't see themâdon't you, mother? Oh, I would give worlds if he could have told you something about it. Wasn't it dreadful for him to be alone so! Do you think he was conscious of it? If he died after they left him, do you think he knew he was alone? Do tell me something about it. Don't you think anything?â Terrible mystery of sudden death! The girl was wild to lift its immovable curtain, and look upon every feature of the tremendous tragedy within. Death in all its forms, every fashion and incident of death, had an awful fascination for her. It was a characteristic of the Wetherel stock, derived perhaps from centuries of serious ancestors who had felt called to reflect much upon matters beyond the grave, or possibly springing from some still more remote spiritual source of feeling which had swept the breed into puritanism. No Wetherel, however light-minded in youth, had ever come to middle age without gravely pondering the trial of death, and preparing himself for it by one system of faith or another. And Alice, through her mother, belonged to this fundamentally earnest-minded race. âWhere is Nestoria?â she presently asked. âWhy doesn't she come here? I will go and tell her.â Mrs. Dinneford caught her daughter by the hand, and held her fast. For the first time since she had become aware of the murder she remembered Nestoria's disappearance; and she feared for Alice's reason, in case some second tragedy should add its horrors to the one before her. âWhat is the matter?â gibbered the shrinking girl, looking about her with eager eyes. âDid you think you saw them?â âI want you to stay with me,â said the mother. âWe will tell Nestoria by and by.â Neighbors soon arrived, men and women and children, all of course in a buzz of wonder, curiosity, and horror. They were strangers to the family, for the excellent old Judge had been somewhat patrician in his social ways, and had not sought to consort with the plain farmers and fishermen of the vicinity. But the presence of a mortal tragedy necessarily broke down reserve, and enabled human sympathy to speak its fitting word and do its helpful deed, so far as words or deeds could be fitting or helpful in such an hour of agitation. A florid, stoutly built man, in a cotton-velvet sack-coat and soiled treusers of brown linen, who proved to be the keeper of a small and noisy âhotelâ near by, presently made himself prominent in the babbling confusion, assumed a leadership over it, and reduced it to order. His first act of authority was to turn the crowd out of the study and post a sentinel at the door. Next, turning to Mrs. Dinneford, he asked, âIs there any property gone? I see the old gentleman's safe is open. You'd better look about and see if anything is missing, and make a note of it.â So there was a hasty, flurried examination. No money was found in the safe, although the Judge always kept a few hundred dollars on hand. âBurglars,â remarked the tavern-keeper, whose name, by the way, was Mr. John Sweet. âLooks decidedly burglarish. Anything else gone?â âI can't see his will,â murmured Mrs. Dinneford, her hands fluttering over the papers on the blood-stained table, without touching them. âHe had two wills here, an old one that was signed, and a new one that he was writing. They are gone, they are both gone.â It was a fresh shock, but it would be hard to say whether she were fairly conscious of it or not, her feelings were in such a turmoil. That a rich legacy might have been lost to her, and that the Wetherel estate might now fall entire into the hands of Edwardâso much she comprehended in a vague way, without a distinct sense of calamity. âBurglarsâyes,â repeated the taverner slowly and after sound reflection. âAnd old uns and bold uns, that's used to takin' risks and knows what risks to take. If I hadn't been a p'lece officer, I wouldn't 'a known what they did that for. The parties concerned 'll have to buy that paper. They'll git letters about it. Them fellers pocketed that paper so as to sell it to the heirs. It's a mighty highflown trick, and I shouldn't wonder if it boosted 'emâ though law is uncertain, that's a fact. And I've known fellers git offâI've knownâgracious!â Mrs. Dinneford dimly understood, but made no comments. âWho did the estate go to, by the way?â was the next question of Mr. Sweet, delivered in an easy, abstracted manner, as if it were of no consequence. In her confusion of mind the good lady promptly stated that the property was to be divided between herself, her daughter, Walter Lehming, and certain benevolent institutions. âAnd wasn't the nephew to have anything?â asked the taverner, so surprised that he showed eagerness. âI seen his nephew t'other day, out on the fishin' grounds,â he immediately added. âThat's all. He don't owe me anything.â âNo, he was not an heir,â sighed Mrs. Dinneford. She was about to add that there had been family troubles, but of a sudden it occurred to her that she was telling more than necessity required, and, still searching with her eyes for the vanished documents, she fell silent. The ancient hunter of criminals made no further remark for perhaps half a minute. He was unquestionably meditating, though he strove to conceal his thoughtfulness by looking intently at the body of the murdered man, his hands meanwhile clasped behind him in a reverent and funeral attitude. After a time there came into his dull and slightly bloodshot brown eye a sparkle which showed that his reflections had culminated in some definite and confident conclusion; and then he fell to studying Mrs. Dinneford, searching her face all over with unfaltering attention, and slightly working his mouth at her as if he were trying to mould her into the sort of person that he desired. At last, touching her on the arm in a way meant to be respectful, he observed in a whisper, âI say!â âWhat?â she started, turning suddenly upon him, with a confused expectation that he was about to point to the murderer. âDon't say anything about that, you understand,â he continued, almost inaudibly. âI mean about the nephew not having anything. Don't tell anybody but the authorities.â With the consciousness of receiving a terrible inward shock, Mrs. Dinneford divined that this man suspected Edward Wetherel of the murder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. A HEROINE VANISHED The supposition that Edward could have committed this horrible crime Mrs. Dinneford instantaneously rejected with all the strength of her kindly nature, not seeking to argue upon it in any manner, even to herself, and not replying a word to Mr. Sweet, but simply shaking her head in strenuous negation. âOh, I dare say it was burglars,â nodded the ex-policeman, preferring that she should so believe and so persuade others, inasmuch as that would leave the field clearer to his own researches, which, as he trusted, would be gainful in lucre. âI only wanted to warn you not to say anything that might make trouble for decent folks. Anybody can see what burglars might expect to get out of that paper. Ransom money; that's the idea.â At this moment Alice, who had gone up stairs to finish her dressing, came rushing down with a cry of, âMother, where is Nestoria? She didn't sleep in her room.â âGirl missing?â eagerly demanded Mr. Sweet. âServant girl? No! What, not the young lady? Well, here's a start.â âShe was a dear, sweet friend of ours,â answered Mrs. Dinneford, hardly able in her agitation to keep herself from screaming. âI can't imagine what has become of her. We must look for her at once.â âThat's so,â was the positive and energetic opinion of Mr. Sweet. âLittle golden-haired young lady, ain't it? I'll set a gang a-going right away.â He was fully in his element now; here was an opportunity to use his bygone experience and show his special ability; and he began upon his task with something like the gleeful eagerness of a hound starting out on a hunt; indeed, he might be described as frisking and gambolling, at least in spirit. It was not humanity which made him so alert, for the unsympathetic fact was that he did not care a sixpence about the safety of the missing girl, his sole motive of action being his acquired instinct for pointing and tracking. With harassing and almost abominable cheerfulness he organized a searching party of men and boys, formed it in an extended loose line after the fashion of skirmishers, and caused it to beat through every wood and thicket in the vicinity. Meantime he himself trotted rapidly along the shore, looking behind every rock and bush and tuft of reeds, examining the sand of the beach for footprints, and scanning the surface of the harbor for floating objects. A careful search of an hour or so only revealed the fact that Nestoria was not in the neighborhood. But Mr. Sweet was not yet at his wit's end. Bouncing into a âsharpy,â he skimmed across the bay to Lighthouse Point, landed near the house where Edward and his friends had lodged, lurked about it until he discovered Mr. Brown alone, and inquired whether young Wetherel wanted to go a-fishing. Mr. Brown, who was a small, knurly, grizzled man of fifty, with wrinkles of chronic discontent about his mouth and nose, replied in an aggrieved, disobliging tone, âHe don't live here.â âWhy, yes he does,â insisted Sweet. âYou've got three boarders, hain't you?â âNo, I hain't,â was the unsocial, surly answer of Brown, meanwhile surveying his visitor offensively. âWell, I'll be blowed if you hain't had three,â retorted Sweet, with some excitement. âWhat's the matter? Have they quit without settlin'?â Having aired his temper enough to sweeten it a little, Mr. Brown now gave what information he had to give, tossing it surlily at Sweet over his shoulder. âYes, they've quit. I expected 'em to stay a month, and they only stayed a week.â âOh, that's the row, is it?â observed the ex-policeman. âI don't call that handsome.â âThe foreigner went three days ago, and the others the next day,â continued Brown. âDid they owe you anything?â âYes,â said Sweet, which was a fib; but he was anxious to conceal the true motives of his early voyage; and he actually put back to his own side of the harbor without telling Brown the news. On reaching Sea Lodge he drew the chambermaid on one side and whispered to her in a confidential manner, âSo the young lady eloped with the rich nephew, did she?â âDeary me!â exclaimed the amazed woman. âDid she? Well, they was engaged, that's a fact. Well, if that isn't most awful! And his poor uncle dead in the house!â âYes, shocking coincidence, wasn't it?â mumbled Sweet, and withdrew himself from her to meditate. He saw it all now: the young man and young woman had run away together; but first one or other of them had stolen the will and killed the old gentleman. âBut what bloody nonsense!â said Mr. Sweet to himself. âThey've made the whole thing as plain as a pikestaff. I don't believe a million can git him off. There'll be a big reward, sure, and I shall have a good chance for it,â was his concluding reflection. Having formed his theory of the tragedy, the ex-policeman commenced looking for evidence to support it. The facts were scanty: there was the mangled body of the victim, and that was pretty much all; so that Mr. Sweet once remarked to himself, âIf it wasn't for the corpse, I'd be ready to swear there hadn't been any murder.â Not a strange footprint had been discovered around the house, and not an article indicative of the assassin had been left in it. The fatal blow had been dealt with a small hatchet, but this primitive weapon belonged on the premises, and had been seen the evening before in the Judge's study, he having made use of it, in his self-helpful way, to nail up a bookshelf. The manner in which the assault had been executed was necessarily a matter of loose and variable guesswork. Mr. Sweet's prevailing opinion was that the old man had fallen asleep in his chair; that the criminal had crept up behind him and attempted to seize money or papers from off the table; that the slumberer had awakened and instinctively seized the intruder, and that then the blow had been delivered. âAnd no regular hand would 'a hit such a lick as that,â reasoned Mr Sweet. âA regular hand don't draw blood when he can help it. A regular hand would 'a choked the old man a little, or stunned him with the hammer end of the hatchet, and taken the money and vamosed. It was a greenhorn that did this job, and it was a greenhorn that the old man knew, so that he had to kill or be shown up. Then there's the will gone; that's a note of the first importance; that p'ints, that does. I did think for a minute that professionals might 'a taken it to bleed the heirs; but, come to consider it, that game would be too almighty risky; professionals wouldn't try it on. The business was done by some man that wanted to destroy the will and keep the old gentleman from making another. And who's the man? The nephew! That's the way I see it.â It must be understood that we are following up Mr. Sweet's cogitations thus closely because he represents the current popular opinion of the moment. While he supposed that he was alone in suspecting Edward Wetherel of the crime, his opinion had already become public property. Nor was the supposition dispelled when the young man appeared at Sea Lodge during the day, and hurried at once to view the body. Grim eyes watched him with boding curiosity, and noted with a terrible sort of satisfaction that he was singularly pallid and tremulous, and that after one brief, speechless gaze at his mangled relative, he recoiled with a shudder and hastily left the room. The only result of his appearance on the spot was that Mr. Sweet was obliged to abandon one of his suppositions. âOf course he wouldn't quit,â argued that gentleman to himself. âI did think for a while that he and the girl might 'a cut off together. But that would 'a made things altogether too plain and easy. He hangs around and plays the innocent game. Of course he would. But it won't save him. He shows his guilt in his face, and he's a goner, sure.â One incomprehensible circumstance, however, kept Mr. Sweet on the secsaw of perplexity. âWhere's the girl?â he repeatedly queried. âThat's what gits me. Did she do it? She's from foreign parts, I understand, and probably didn't have much of a bringin' up. Sposin' now the feller got the girl into the job, how would that work? The old man is asleep, and the girl begins to fumble round for the will, and the old man wakes up and grabs her, and she gits scared and hits him. But then what was the use of startin' out to steal the will unless she meant to finish him and stop his makin' another? And would a girl like that be able to screw her courage up to such a bustin' old job? I guess not. It was the feller that did it, I'll bet my pile on it.â But Mr. Sweet was destined to go through many changes in his opinions concerning the tragedy. During the day he learned from indisputable witnesses that Edward Wetherel had passed the whole of the previous night in New Haven, keeping up till near morning a farewell âspreeâ of a boisterous nature with his friend Wolverton. âIt was the girl that did it,â declared the ex-policeman on learning these facts. âShe did it, but she did it in the nephew's interest, and very likely at his request. She did it, and she meant to do it, and then she cut and run. We never shall git to the bottom of this case till we find that girl.â Mr. Sweet, however, had scarcely installed himself comfortably in this conclusion, when he was ousted from it by a new discovery. He found a certain Tom Higgs, the keeper of a little oyster shop on the New Haven road, who was ready to swear that during the evening of the murder he had seen a man of young Wetherel's appearance pass his lair in the direction of Sea Lodge. Flatly contradicted as this story was by the New Haven alibi, the ex-policeman could not help hailing it with vague credence, and thus dropped back once more into a suspicion of Edward. In this undecided state we must for the present leave him, merely adding that the public mind was quite as much bewildered as his, and that the coroner's jury found a verdict of murder by the hand of some person unknown, so that the Wetherel tragedy might be said to have already taken on the shape of a mystery. Let us now return to Edward Wetherel. After that brief glance of his at the murdered Judge, he had hastened up stairs to visit Mrs. Dinneford and Alice. They were in a room by themselves; the mother, prostrated by that reaction which follows violent excitement, was in tears; the daughter, her face swollen with crying, was talking garrulously, still putting piteous questions about the death scene. At sight of the grief and agitation of the two women the young fellow's nerves gave way, and, throwing himself upon a sofa and hiding his face, he sobbed violently. âIsn't it horrible, Edward?â gasped Alice. âOh, wasn't it horrible for him to die so!â âOh, horrible, horrible, horrible!â he repeated in a shuddering tone. His emotion was so violent, and to Mrs. Dinneford its violence was so unexpected, that she looked at him with surprise and alarm. Could it be that the hotel-keeper was right, and that Edward was in some way guilty of his uncle's blood, and that this perturbation was remorse? For a few seconds the frightful suggestion was so mighty that she fought helplessly against it, as a sleeper struggles with a nightmare. But the next utterance of the young fellow turned her kindly and charitable soul from suspicion to hope. âI seemed to see it all at once,â said he. âAll at once I saw just what a brute and fool I had been.â Mrs. Dinneford lifted her eyes to heaven; here was a little comfort amid great trouble; perhaps Edward would be better than he had been. âAnd poor Nestoria!â Alice babbled on. âPoor little Nestoria! What has become of her? What do you think, Edward?â âWhy, what has become of her?â demanded the young man, springing to his feet. âNobody has told me anything. What has happened?â Then came the story of the strange disappearance of the girl, and the fruit less search for her. âI must go and look for her,â said Edward, and hurried out of the room with a face almost too pale to belong to a living man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. FRIENDS AND COMFORTERS. SCARCELY had Edward left the Dinnefords when there arrived two other visitors, the relatives who had been for some time expected as guestsâ Mr. John Bowlder and Mr. Walter Lehming. Mr. Bowlder was a man of headlong demeanor and plunging gait. He entered the room crown foremost, and with great vehemence, somewhat as if he were a ram or he-goat who had butted down the door, and was about to inflict the same violence upon the window sash, and go flying into the garden. He was big and heavily moulded, and a loose suit of ready-made clothing made him appear even larger than he was, so that he had the roly-poly look of a fat Newfoundland puppy. His head was monstrous, or at least it seemed to be monstrous, it was so magnified by a vast shock of hair and a bushy beard, both as white as if he were eighty years old, although he could not have been above fifty. His face was so pink and fresh that it put one in mind of a healthy infant; and his large blue eyes had a benevolent, dreamy tenderness which was very beautiful. He made a stamping, jolting rush at the ladies, shook them both at once by the hand with exhilarating energy, and gushed a stream of friendly incoherence. âI have just seen Edward,â he opened abruptly, without any prelude of salutations. âCheer up about your little friend who has vanished into the unknown. He has found a suggestion of her. Delicate omens traced in air. There is a boat gone, and she must have taken it. Edward is off in search of her. Thought will dissolve the universe and find her at the bottom of it. As for the Judge, dear me, dear me! What can I say to comfort you? The red slayer has been here. But then when he thinks he slays he errs. Our noble old friend lives on in the heaven of the good. Well, here is Lehming. Lehming, I got in your way, my good fellow. Come forward and speak your divine consolations. The voice of the heart is the voice of the gods.â Walter Lehming was at least as peculiar in appearance as John Bowlder. In age he might have been twenty-eight, but he looked nearer forty. He was very short, hardly more than five feet in height, and by many persons would have been called a dwarf. Nor was this insignificant figure well proportioned, for his brevity of stature lay mainly in his legs, his body being of nearly the natural size. His chest, indeed, was of unusual girth, and there was a more than ordinary fulness between the shoulders, so that at first glance he gave one an impression of rickets. As with most men of inferior height, his head was disproportionately large; and it seemed all the larger because of its luxuriant covering of straight, matted brown hair. His face was long, marked by prominent cheek-bones and a heavy chin, and of a reddened, sallow complexion, not unlike the tint of a Madeira nut. This plain countenance, at first view so unprepossessing and almost repulsive, was lighted up by a cheerful and amiable expression, which in the end rendered it agreeable. The large gray eyes were patient, meditative, intelligent, and kind; the coarsely modelled mouth had a smile of little less than divine sweetness. When he spoke, moreover, his low voice at once charmed the ear and touched the soul, so musical was it, so cultured, and so sympathetic. âMy dear aunt!â he said, gently taking Mrs. Dinneford's hand and looking her in the face with a composed pity which told of a heart that had learned to be tranquil under sorrows. âI wish that I could have been here to support you under the first burst of this calamity. How much you must have suffered!â Tears sprang into the impulsive, soft-hearted woman's eyes, and bending down toward Lehming, as one bends to a child, she kissed his withered cheek. It was affecting to see the humble gratitude which lighted up the young man's old face in response to this salutation. Since the death of his mother very few tokens of affection had come his way, and even the embrace of an elderly relative was to him a great and unexpected compliment. We must explain, in passing, that neither of these two men pertained in any manner to the Wetherel stock. John Bowlder was a cousin of the deceased Mr. Dinneford, and Walter Lehming was the son of that gentleman's sister, so that he was only a nephew to Mrs. Dinneford by marriage. âAnd here is Alice,â said the shaken woman, fighting with sobs for her voice, but smiling cordially at the same time, so irrepressible was her kindness and cheerfulness. âYou must kiss her too, Walter. We must cling together now, like brethren in one tent. Alice and I will want all the friendship you can give, for our oldest and best friend is gone from us, and has left us very solitary. It seems to me sometimes as if the angel of mercy stoppeth not to comfort, but passeth by on the other side. These bereavements and tragedies do shake one's faith. We have had an awful revelation of the wickedness that can exist in the world. To think that any human being should want to kill our dear, good, beneficent old friend, whose life was one long labor of love for his fellow ereatures! He thought so much of you, Walter! He was set upon leaving a portion of his property to you because, he said, you were his relative in the Lord if not in the flesh, and he knew you would be guided to dispense it for good. But, oh dear, what am I talking about! I ought not, perhaps, to have told you of that, for crime has spread its awful mystery and entanglements over this whole matter, and we don't yet rightly know what shall be. It almost seems as if Providence had taken counsel this time to bring the plans of the godly to naught. The will has disappeared, and of course if it isn't found you will have nothing, Walter.â âDon't speak of it,â replied Lehming with perfect composure and the smile of a seraph. âBut is the will really gone?â he quickly added, as if a new thought had occurred to him which made the subject important. âAnd you, then?â âOh, never mind that now,â sighed Mrs. Dinneford. âAlice and I have enough to make us comfortable. We will talk of that by and by, and I shall want your advice about investments at a proper time. I didn't mean to mention the will, but my mind does run on so when it gets started, and seeing you quite upset me for a minute. Cousin Wetherel thought so much of you. And now Edward will have the whole of it, and go no one knows whither. But perhaps he will mend, now or later. You know Tupper says, `Let a spendthrift grow to be old, he will set his heart on saving.' And if he had nothing he might be tempted to more and greater follies, for poverty shall make a man desperate and hurry him ruthless into crime. I don't mean to prophesy hard things of Edward, nor to bring him to the bar of my poor judgment. He came to see us just now, and behaved most beautifully.â âIt is a pleasure and a duty to hope for the best,â said Lehming. âThe weight of great responsibility often makes young men suddenly wise. He is intelligent, you know, and good-hearted.â âHe has just rushed off after that missing girl in the noblest manner,â put in John Bowlder, his great blue eyes twice as large as life with excitement. âHe went on his mission like a spiritual activity. I ought to have borne him company. That girl must be found.â âWhy! did you know her?â asked Alice. âNever saw her in my life,â declared John Bowlder. âNever heard of her till ten minutes ago. But what does that matter? The divine soul is promptly receptive to misfortune. Unhappiness always dazzles me. All men and women who are clothed in it take to me a nobler form. Don't understand me as getting on the housetops to boast. But, as Emerson says, why should we make it a point to disparage with our false modesty that man we are? If I am not helpful, I am heartful.â âCousin John, you run over with Emerson as I do with Tupper,â said Mrs. Dinneford, laughing out of the midst of her sorrows, for her humors were wonderfully variable, chasing each other to and fro like kittens. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to explain that ruddy, headlong John Bowlder sought to be a philosopher, and that his favorite tap in philosophy was the one commonly called transcendental. He worshipped Emerson, admired Thoreau, and read much in Walt Whitman. Years before this, carried away by the story of âWalden,â as many a boy has been by that of âRobinson Crusoe,â he rushed into the forests of Maine, built a hermitage there, and communed obstinately with unsympathizing nature, until a party of surveyors found him bedridden with rheumatism and starving, and sent him back to the degrading comforts of civilization. âWhat is the next thing to be done?â gently inquired the unassuming Lehming. âI am ready to take all your labors off your hands as far as possible.â âThe next thing!â groaned Mrs. Dinneford. âIt seems as if everything came next. The whole future is such a struggling medley, or at least my poor mind is! But here is a matter that needs counsel immediately. Here is a letter to Nestoria; it came this noon, and it must be from her father; just see the foreign postmarks. What shall be done with it? Shall I open it?â âUnder the circumstances we are justified in opening it,â decided Lehming after brief reflection. âThere may be something in it which will indicate whither she would be likely to go. My supposition of course is that she witnessed the tragedy, and was frightened away by it. This letter may mention friends of hers with whom she might be led to take refuge. Yes, it is our duty to open it.â Mrs. Dinneford broke the seal, skimmed hastily through the epistle, and uttered a cry of poignant distress. âHer father is dead,â she cried. âThis is from one of his brother missionaries. The poor thing hasn't a home in the whole world. Oh, why doesn't she come back to us?â âThis is terrible,â sighed Lehming, his sallow face beautiful with compassion; while John Bowlder suddenly thrust his hands into his white beard and did violence to it. âWe must labor now by day and night to find her,â sobbed Mrs. Dinneford. âAt once!â answered John Bowlder vehemently. âWe must rush into this calamity like firemen into a burning house. But cheer up, my human friends. Labor done with a will is sure to conquer. The will is in itself a guide. As Emerson says, `A breath of will blows eternally through the universe in the direction of the right and necessary.' I shall take a boat and go over this whole harbor.â âCousin John, you may go under it,â observed Mrs. Dinneford. âCan you row?â âI can learn,â declared John Bowlder. âBut the wind was strong last night, and if she got into a boat it must have blown her out into the Sound, and the Sound here is twenty miles wide.â âI shall remember that,â said John Bowlder. And take a boat he did; and upset himself three rods from high-water mark, wading ashore through the shallows with undiminished spirit, but finding himself obliged to go to bed until his clothes could be dried; for as usual he had lost his valise in his late journeyings, and neither the Judge's garments nor Lehming's were big enough for him. Getting tired presently of retirement, he wrapped a coverlet about him and sat by his window, discoursing to the curious idlers who wandered about the grounds, and exhorting them in mystical. proverbial sentences to be helpful. âYour goodness must have some edge to it, else it is none,â he lectured to a knot of boys who gathered to stare at him. âGo out and do your bidden work, if you do it alone. Shun father and brother, if your good genius calls you, and they hear it not. But be sure you know how to row before you leap into your shallop. Columbus himself needed a planet to shape his course upon. The brightest of all pole stars in our heaven is experience. At the same time we must not follow the old wife's rule of refusing to go into the water until we can swim. Indeed, courage is the especial duty of youth. The young are apostles. To them the superhuman voice incessantly commands, Go ye forth. I am not speaking now of stealing apples nor of robbing birds' nests, but of conferring benefits and straining the higher activities. The soul walks with bended neck in cellars, but loftily and usefully above ground.â âBenny, come here,â yelled one urchin to another, more distant, with whom he was in friendly relations. âHere's a bully old crazy man, an' he's a goin' it like everything. I guess he's the murderer. Come an' look at him.â Somewhat disconcerted by this misconception, Mr. Bowlder returned to his bed until his flannel suit should be dried, leaving the disentanglement of the Wetherel mystery to others, at least for the present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE ACCUSED MAN. Edward Wetherel, an excellent boatman and not liable to do his navigation keel uppermost, was no more successful than John Bowlder in discovering the missing âsharpy,â which, as some surmised, had carried Nestoria away. It was after nightfall when the young man returned to Sea Lodge. He was tired, gloomy, and dispirited, and, although he spent an hour or so with his relatives, he said very little to them and hardly seemed to hear their conversation. Any one who had studied him under the suspicion that he might be the murderer, would have been puzzled to find proofs of either innocence or guilt in his brooding, sorrowful face and absent-minded demeanor. One thing, however, seemed obvious and positive enough; and that was, that he knew nothing of the whereabouts or fate of Nestoria. He spoke of her in a tone of perplexity, anxiety, and distress, which could not be simulated. âI must go back to the city,â he said at last. âI propose to engage a tugboat to take me out on another search at daybreak. When I pass here, will you join me, Lehming? I want some one to keep me company.â âI will go with you,â promised Lehming, looking gently into the woful eyes which were asking this favor of him. âBlow your steam-whistle opposite the house, and I will put out to you in a small boat.â So, early the next morning, amid the tender redness of a summer dawn, the two young men set off on their expedition, steaming out into the calm, gleaming expanse of the Sound. âI hope you slept last night,â said Lehming, studying with surprise and pity his companion's pallid face. âI went through a few nightmares,â replied Wetherel. âThis is a horrible, crushing affair. I wonder if I shall come out of it sane.â âI see that you are greatly oppressed by it,â murmured Lehming, turning away his eyes from a desperation which pained him, it seemed so impossible to comfort it. âOne thing is certain. You must give yourself some rest as quickly as possible, and you must obtain sleep at any cost.â âThe tragedy of my uncle's death would alone have shocked me enough,â continued Edward. âWe did not agree, and he had cut me off; but death rubs out so many things! When I heard of him as murdered, I forgot that we had ever been hostile; no, I remembered it!â he added with a piteous accent of remorse. âI would have given years of life for one moment in which to make my peace with him. That other world into which men slip so suddenly! It takes the color out of this one.â âYou are like your family,â said Lehming meditatively. âAll the Wetherels whom I have known have been impressionable to the spectacle of death. It is a desirable sensibility; it is fruitful of good.â âDo you think so?â asked Edward, in the tone of a man who judges evilly of himself, and has little hope of becoming worthier. âI don't know. I admit the sensibility in my own case. But it only fills me with gloom.â âBut I was about to tell you something horrible,â he resumed presently, with a great effort. âDo you know that I am accused of this murder? I believe that I never shall smile again, and I don't know why I should live.â The cheering smile which Lehming had struggled to wear hitherto disappeared; it fell under this tremendous announcement, as a man falls under the blow of an assassin. The compassion which beamed in his large gray eyes was still angelic, but it seemed the pity of a seraph for a totally lost spirit, rather than for one whose sorrow is not without hope. He must, however, make some answer; and what should it be? A weaker man, overcome by the sight of distress, might have counterfeited ignorance of the frightful suspicion which Edward had mentioned, and denied that it could be harbored by any one. But this dwarfish and misshapen creature was an incarnation of conscience and intelligence; he had neither the hypocrisy nor the folly to treat such a situation as this otherwise than with sincerity. âYours is a terrible position,â he said firmly. âYou must call up all the manhood, all the power to bear calamity, that has been granted you. Crime is not always discovered, but innocence always is. In the end the world is charitable and disposed to believe the best. Little by little this accusation, or rather this suspicion, will die.â âDo you believe me guilty?â gasped Edward, his face turning ashy, notwithstanding the cheering words to which he had listened. âI do not,â answered Lehming solemnly. âThis charge had already been made in my hearing. I had considered it, and rejected it.â The tall, vigorous young man grasped the hand of the deformed one and clung to it for minutes in silence. âIt is time to turn over a new leaf in my book,â he said when he had suf ficiently recovered his self-possession to speak. âI have had a commentary on my life which I did not expect. I am face to face with the fact that men consider my character bad enough to justify them in suspecting me of the greatest of crimes. It is time to turn a new leaf, if I know how to turn it.â âThe knowledge of such things springs from the desire to do them,â observed Lehming. âYou see, I have gained so much by this tragedy!â continued Edward, his mind reverting to the accusation against him. âI was to have nothing; and now, if that will is not recovered, I have everything.â âI know,â gently murmured Lehming, without a tremor of disappointment in his voice. âYou are the heir at law. Events have determined that the inheritance shall take its natural course.â âYou shall see what course the inheritance will take,â exclaimed Wetherel excitedly. âWait!â interposed Lehming promptly, and almost in a tone of command. âYou are feverish now. Make no resolutions until you have recovered your usual health and mental vigor. Months hence, after the estate has been settled, it will be time to discuss this question. Meantime your first and most pressing duty is to discover this missing young lady. May I venture to tell you what I think of her case?â âDo you suspect her?â demanded Edward, with sudden anger. âOh, I beg your pardon,â he added, in response to Lehming's gesture of energetic negation. âBut that is another of the scoundrelly tales that these gossips are spreading. They say that, because she was betrothed to me, she took the will and struck the blow. It is the wickedest and maddest and most idiotic slander that ever malice and stupidity invented. A crime! She couldn't conceive the thought of a crime. There never was such innocence. Oh, I must clear her, as well as myself. It must be my life's labor to open up this mystery and discover the real criminal. I shall have to keep a little of the money for that purpose, Lehming.â âYou must not talk any more now about the money,â said Walter. âPut that matter resolutely by until you have had time for cool reflection. Let us now speak of Miss Bernard. I must tell you frankly that I have my fears for her. I fear that she saw the tragedy; that the horror of the spectacle drove her half frantic; that she fled from the house and leaped into the missing boat; and that then she was driven out to sea. The sad question is whether accident enabled her to survive the stormy night.â Edward made no reply further than to lean upon the bulwark and hide his face in his hands. Except the above conversation, important as showing Wetherel's condition of spirit, nothing worthy of record occurred during this voyage. After zigzagging the Sound in all directions, and making fruitless inquiries at various points of the Long Island shore, the young men returned at evening to report their failure to the mourners at Sea Lodge. âWhat do you think of Edward?â anxiously inquired Mrs. Dinneford of Lehming, when she found herself alone with him. âI think well of him,â he replied. âThere has been a wonderful change in his modes of judging and feeling. He seems as conscientious and unselfish as an angel could demand of a mortal. The only question is whether the impression will hold after the stamp is withdrawn; I mean the pressure of this tragedy and this sorrow. Wealth and beauty are great tempations. I can imagine their power, although I have never been exposed to it.â âMy poor, good Walter, you haven't had half a chance,â replied Mrs. Dinneford, coloring with compassionate admiration. âI never had but one compliment,â he smiled. âWhen I was a little boy I went to visit my grandmother. The scene is before me now. I sat in one corner of the fireplace, reading `Robinson Crusoe.' My grandmother, who was talking with another venerable lady, surveyed me now and then over her spectacles. At last the good old creature remarked, in her tremulous, sympathetic voice, `I don't think Walter is quite so humpbacked as he used to be.' That,â concluded Lehming, with a cheerful and yet most pathetic humor, âthat is the only compliment that I ever had concerning my personal appearance.â âIt was too bad!â laughed Mrs. Dinneford while the tears rushed into her eyes. Then leaning suddenly toward the young man, she laid a motherly, loving hand on his misshapen shoulder, and added, âWalter, you are as handsome as an angel. You have a beauty that all the rolling years of eternity won't fade. There is your second compliment.â âIt is enough to ruin a St. Paul,â smiled Walter, shaking his big head. âWell, let us talk of graver matters, if anything can be graver than I am. It is understood, is it not, that we acquit Edward of all suspicion of complicity in this crime?â âWe doâall of us,â declared Mrs. Dinneford. âThe world does not,â said Lehming. âAnd we must support him against the world. No man, oppressed by widespread suspicion and without friends to uphold and cheer him, can easily come to good.â âThe world is an ill-natured idiot,â pronounced Mrs. Dinneford indignantly. âAs Tupper says, `Rashly nor ofttimes truly doth man pass sentence on his brother.' And, in another place, `Then man's verdict cometh, murderer with forethought malice; and his name is an execration, his guilt is too black for devils; but to the righteous judge seemeth he the suffering victim. Tupper is really wonderful; he is pat to every subject.â âTupper is better than the critics have been willing to admit,â conceded the charitable Lehming. âBut do you think Edward should have all this money?â queried the ady, who, it must be remembered, had a daughter to care for. âThe law must take its course.â âBut do you think he ought to keep it, under the circumstances, knowing his uncle's wishes?â âWe can say nothing.â âNo,â sighed Mrs. Dinneford. âWell, Alice and I are not poor; we can do as we have done. But youâI do wish that you could have something.â âAs long as there are schools to keep, I trust that I shall not suffer,â said Lehming with his heavenly smile. âLet me revert to my subject. For Edward's sake, and for the sake of our own dignity and our purity of soul, we must be his firm friends. Is is agreed?â âYes,â affirmed the good lady. âWe are all agreed on that pointâyou and I and John Bowlder and Aliceâthe whole family. Of this thing Edward is as innocent as a lamb, and we will bear him our testimony and give him our countenance.â But in the world outside of this unselfish and charitable circle opinion was generally less favorable to the young man. The large rewards which he offered for the discovery of the assassin, the uncertain verdict of the coroner's jury, and the complete bewilderment of the officers of justice, were all insufficient to relieve him of suspicion. Many persons believed that he personally stole the will and struck the blow; others held that he had incited this missing and mysterious young woman from over sea to commit the double crime; others suspended their decision, as they phrased it, and allowed him, not the benefit, but the injury of the doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. THE TRAGEDY A MYSTERY. Lehming had a sweet tenacity of kindliness which would not let him forget his resolution to stand by Edward Wetherel, nor neglect any opportunity of putting his friendly purposes into practice. âWe must have that young man with us,â he said to Mrs. Dinneford. âHis excitement is too great to permit him to bear continuous fatigue and watching. All labor is wearing to a man who is unaccustomed to it, and when the motive of labor is anxiety or grief, the candle is lighted at both ends. I know that he does not sleep. After a day spent in searches and inquiries and hopes deferred, he passes the night in struggling with nightmares of murders and kidnappings, or in feverish waiting for the dawn. He will drive himself mad, unless he is stopped on the road by a fever, or unless we take charge of him. The work that he is doing can all be done by othersâby the authorities and the police. There is no need of his attending to it with such wasting and wearing vehemence. I wish you would insist with him upon his joining us.â âCertainly!â answered Mrs. Dinneford with energy. âDear me, why didn't I think of it? We can make room for him here easily enough; and it's his own house, too, for that matter. What did I let him go back to the city for, as if he were not one of us? Well, I suppose I know why; and I may as well make my confession. The wretched truth is, Walter, that I did harbor a small wicked doubt about him, though the very idea is monstrous and a temptation of Moloch. How fearfully we are given to uncharity and backbiting, even in the secret depths of our souls! And I couldn't help saying to myself, too, that, if he was in the least responsible for the dreadful things that have come to pass among us, he would be so uncomfortable here, with poor Cousin Wetherel lying dead and poor little Nestoria gone, and the shadow of their calamity sitting in every room of the house. It is odd and foolish enough to tell, but it was partly pity that moved me to let him go. I should hate to make Satan himself uncomfortable, if I was acquainted with him and had to watch his countenance. But Edward is not guilty, and I must get all these temptations of uncharitable doubt out of my heart; and, as you say, we must have him with us, and watch over him body and soul. And so, Walter, I do wish you would drive up to New Haven and bring him down to us bag and baggage, as fast as old Sorrel can hobble.â Lehming went on his mission of mercy, and performed it with success. Edward joined his relatives, and remained with them during their brief further stay at Sea Lodge, and accompanied them in their mortuary journey to the Judge's final home. The funeral took place in Brooklyn, where the old man had resided during rather more than the last half century, and where he had quietly grown, with the rise of landed estate, from modest beginnings to great opulence. We will not describe it further than to say that it was one of those events which interest a city, and that as a spectacle it was notable for solemnity and multitudes. The family union did not break up immediately. Mrs. Dinneford lived on in the Brooklyn house, and the three men remained for a little time with her, giving what blitheness they could to the bereaved abode. This was not much; they were all more or less haunted and sobered by the tragedy; and it had followed them from Sea Lodge like a ghost, or like the lingerings of a fever. If they could have ruled their souls, if they had been persons of hardened sensibilities and lumpish or seared imaginations, they might have laid the matter aside in confidence that it would give them no imminent trouble, or none of practical import. The Wetherel Mystery had really fallen into blind lethargy, and for some time to come was to have no life but that of spreading in stagnant, inscrutable pools, or rather of creeping in torpid concealment like a river lost under âtrembling prairies.â But it was very natural that this fact should not seem possible to the people who were intimately connected with the tragedy, and that they should still look from hour to hour to see it emerge in startling fashion from its obscurities. Edward Wetherel especially seemed to be in constant expectation of finding some trace either of the murderer or of Nestoria. He was apparently busy from morning till night in devising or setting in action some new method of search. He haunted the police offices of Brooklyn and New York, and made several journeys in search of intelligence to New Haven. In view of the peculiar responsibility under which he lay, it was probably well for him that his character drove him into these labors. The horrors of any exceptional and frightful situation, as, for instance, a battle, a shipwreck, or a conflagration, are alleviated by a demand for activity. The troops who may and must charge, or otherwise exert themselves, suffer less in mind than those who are obliged to lie still under fire. This young man was too hard worked to drift into a melancholy, or to hearken to those vices which allure sorrow with a promise of cheer. In the physical fatigues of every day he found an opiate which, to his own amazement and almost indignation, brought him healthful sleep. âHe is able to bear his great load,â said the rejoiced Lehming to Mrs Dinneford. âNot only is he bearing it, but he is drawing strength from it; he is already a greater and better man than he was a month since. In order to do him full justice, we must consider what temptations he is resisting. A thoroughly hardened and worldly spirit would find his situation quite endurable, and would settle down under it into an egoistic tranquillity. Suspected men, if they are able and prosperous, easily live down suspicion. All that Edward has to do, in order to win the world's respect and even its admiration, is to keep his uncle's estate, heap it up into millions, and become a powerful capitalist, able to help or hinder others. Hospitality and generosity would give him popularity and surround him with syeophants. There, too, is pleasure; he might enjoy it to the full, as of old; he might divert himself with incessant gayeties. But we see nothing in him of either Midas or Sardanapalus. A new nature has appeared; a new soul has been born. Not a new one, either; it is the grave, earnest soul of the Wetherels; it is the resurrection of his Puritan ancestors. While he had nothing in his life to give him pause, he rushed on in the natural ways of untrammelled youth, too exuberant and fortunate for self-control. But a great spiritual paroxysm has brought the foundation granite to the surface. The moment he was driven to feel and reflect, he became the traditionary Wetherel. My hope is, yes, and my confident trust also, that his future life will be one of duty.â âI do fervently join with you in that hope and trust,â replied Mrs. Dinneford. âAnd I must quote Tupper. Don't you remember that passage about the generous heart, lit by unhallowed fire? And then he goes on: `Yet I walted a little year, and the mercy thou hadst forgotten hath purged that aoble spirit, washing it in waters of repentance.' I can't help looking for speech to Tupper. He says just what plain people think, better than they can say it for themselves.â âWe must reckon conscience a constitutional trait,â put in oracular John Bowlder, struck by Lehming's ethnological explanation of the change in Edward's character, and continuing the subject with a pleasing sense of originality. âThe Germanic races, who discovered truth-telling, practise it as no other breed does. I would not be sure that a Wetherel of ancient days, as long ago perhaps as the reign of Odin, did not discover the sense of duty. Edward retains that kind of pulse. He will be a good man.â âCousin Bowlder, you are little better than one of the heathen,â smiled Mrs. Dinneford. âYou might as well trace up godliness to the giants before the flood, and not stop for it in the times of Balder bold, whom Gray tells us about; and a very pretty poem it is, too, though not equal to his `Elegy' by a great deal.â âNature and grace combine to evolve character,â observed Lehming. âThey are both forces under the command of the same great Creator of character.â âThere is another thing which I reverence in Edward,â continued the mystical Bowlder, too indifferent to orthodox criticism to defend himself against it. âIt is his health. He is not one of those who have cold feet and torpid digestions. He can run and think all day. I consider myself burly, but he canters me blind. Such a man, a man with sense of duty for a boiler and with driving wheels that never burst, will achieve results. We shall yet brag of Edward!â In partial correction of these kindly judgments and vaticinations, we must observe that Edward's spiritual spread of wing was not as yet a notably broad one, nor such as promised to indifferent beholders any wondrous loftiness of flight. To the common eye he was simply a decent, serious, fairly able and hard-working young man. He evidently had a purpose in life; but it was directly and narrowly connected with the event which had roused him out of his epicurean egotism; it was a simple determination to clear himself of the suspicion which had fallen upon him, and to find the missing Nestoria. At the same time he exhibited ordinary foresight with regard to the possibilities of his own future. Remembering that the lost will might be recovered, and that in such case he might be obliged, or feel obliged, to support himself, he commenced the study of medicine and prosecuted it with energy. Furthermore, he labored daily at the complicated task of settling the estate, and thus familiarized himself with the mystery of investments and the details of business. This job, by the way, supported him; he paid all his expenses, personal and extraordinary, out of his administrator's fees; not a dollar of the principal would he as yet apply to his own purposes. This estate, this million which had not been meant for him, weighed upon his mind. As things stood, the whole of it was his; but under the circumstances he could not allow himself to claim his entire legal right; and there was the perplexing question how the property should be divided. As time went on, the matter became urgent, and at last he was driven to a decision. One evening he called the family togetherâMrs. Dinneford, and Alice, and Lehming, and John Bowlderâand with some embarrassment opened his burden. âI want to consult you about an affair which concerns four of us very seriously,â he said. âI wish it concerned you too, Mr. Bowlder. It is this estate. You know of course that I have taken out letters of administration, and that I have been acting under them. I thought it the best way. I wanted the matter entirely in my own hands, so that I could settle it as might seem to me right.â âHas the Judge come to life again!â thought John Bowlder, while Edward paused to consider his next words. âHow the boy shoulders his responsibility, and stays himself on his conscience! Business and duty are matters of inheritance, as much in the blood as certain diseases.â âIt has not been an easy question to handle,â resumed the young man. âBut I have reached a conclusion. You shall hear. I am not the intended heir. My conscience will not let me lay hands on this wealth which the law offers me. You threeâMrs. Dinneford, Alice, and Lehmingâyou must take it and keep it, at the sole charge of fulfilling the bequests.â âNot while I live, Edward!â shouted John Bowlder, springing to his feet and plunging about the room like a happy rhinoceros. âI'll murder them all three, if they do. We will have no such greediness and griping in this house, so long as I can procure instruments of death. The gods have righted injustice. Let it stay righted in the name of the gods. Keep your pelf or give it out of your own hand to the needy or worthy, but don't whimper that it isn't yours and drop it like a scared child. Mrs. Dinneford, what do you say to this ascetic, sitting upon his pillar? He is a man, isn't he, with a heart too big for his head? What word have you for such a soul as that?â âBut it's out of the question, Edward,â cried Mrs. Dinneford, so moved by the young fellow's proffer that she did not hear Bowlder's sentimental uproar, or notice the whimsical generosity with which he refused money that had been offered to other people. âWe can't accept your gift. None of us consented to that will of Cousin Wetherel's. Weââand she faltered at the foot of a great and difficult steep of heroismââwe claim nothing. It is all yours. Do with it as seemeth to you good.â âCertainly,â added Walter Lehming, with a composure which was more decisive than any clamor could be. âI expected as much,â said Edward, drawing a sigh of relief. âAnd yet I would have surrendered all, if you had accepted. Well, now I must act. John Bowlder is quite right in saying that I must give this pelf out of my own hand, and not wait for others to take it. I shall divide the estate according to the will, with one exception. Mrs. Dinneford and Alice and Lehming will each receive what my uncle allotted to them. If I do not owe this to you three, I owe it to him. The remainderâthat portion which was devised to charitiesâI shall keep. I have my own purposes of justice and benevolence.â âThis is a distressing subject,â observed Lehming. âI answer for myself alone. I refuse.â âYou will be powerless,â said the inexorable Edward. âYour portion will be trusteed to you. Why do you wish to embarrass me?â âAnother time,â persisted Lehming, rising and walking to the door. âWe will discuss this again, when we are calmer. I am too much agitated now, and so are you. But let me tell you that, while I cannot submit to you, I reverence you.â âEdward,â said Alice, taking her cousin's arm, âI would fall in love with you if you wanted it. What else can a girl do?â Meantime Mrs. Dinneford and John Bowlder had each seized a hand of the young fellow. Tears of gratitude and happiness stood in his eyes; these people, at least, did not believe him a criminal. But we must turn aside from Edward Wetherel for a little while to see what had been the fate of Nestoria Bernard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. THE FLIGHT OF NESTORIA. On the night in which Judge Wetherel, with murder stealthily watching him from outer darkness, sat up to rewrite his will for the benefit of Nestoria Bernard, the girl herself sat up in her own room, unable to sleep. She was thinking of Edward; of the warnings which she had received that he was unworthy of her; of the vague, incomplete, and yet gladdening retractions which had followed on those warnings; of his beauty and graciousness and irresistible tendernesses and lovable lovingness; of the decision which must come to her concerning him from her father; of the undecipherable obscurity of life beyond that; then again of Edward, always of Edward. Amid so many meditations, of a character so sweetly or sorrowfully potent for disturbance, how could she sleep, or even prepare herself for sleep? Furthermore, there was something in the air of the night, a breath of miasma perhaps from the marshes that stretched away along the westering coast, which filled her nerves with tremors of unrest. Still dressed, she kept vigil for an hour or two (how long she could not afterward remember) in a state of mind which she tried to order into thought, but which persisted in remaining revery. All manner of spiritual wanderings, a nomadic host of recollections, plans, hopes, and fancies, came to her in confused succession, pushing one another aside with eager impatience, like the hasty, transitory phantasms of dreams. Things that belonged to the past and things that urgently claimed the future plucked at her for a moment's consideration and vanished. It was one of those hours in which the soul resembles a sea of little waves, devoid of drift or power, tossing with wearisome monotony and breaking without result. Of a sudden she perceived that her purse, containing all her little wealth a hundred dollars or thereabouts, was not in her pocket. Poor as she was and far away from the father who was her only source of supply, this disappearance was a matter of rousing importance. Wondering at her own carelessness, she started up with a beating heart and commenced a search for the lost valuable. It was nowhere in the room; but presently it occurred to her that during the early evening she had bought a cheap little painted basket from a wandering Indian, who had made her think of Sassacus and King Philip; and then she remembered that she had last seen her treasure in the parlor. She trusted tremblingly that it was there yet, and, lighting a candle, she went down stairs to look for it, treading softly so as not to disturb the slumbering household. Under a cushion of the sofa, just where she had mechanically placed it for temporary safety, she found the purse. With a childlike sense of having escaped a great peril, and with a piteous unconsciousness of the real and horrible jeopardy of life which lurked within a few yards of her, she joyfully thrust the treasure into the waist of her dress, and turned to leave the room. But the quick movement extinguished her candle; she was obliged to halt where she was until her eyes could become accustomed to the sudden imposition of darkness; and now she made a discovery which only this obscurity could have enabled her to make. A single frail beam of light came to her tenderly, like some delicate angel warning her of danger. In her surprise she nearly uttered an exclamation; and had she done so, she might have arrested the step of imminent homicide, as also she might have brought its alarmed violence upon herself. Being a brave girl, with the steady nerves of health, she remained silent, and calmly studied the apparition, discovering almost immediately that it came from the keyhole of the study door. So unfamiliar was she with the thought of crime, that, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, not a suspicion of murder or burglary crossed her. She took it for granted that Judge Wetherel had been kept up by pressure of urgent business; and, saying to herself that she would surprise him with a second âgood-night,â she glided toward the study. On reaching the door, however, the idea came to her that her venerable friend might not like to be disturbed in his work, and she paused. Her hand was still upon the knob, when she heard within an indistinct utterance in a tone which she did not fully recognize; her first instantaneous idea being that it could not be the voice of the Judge, and her next that he was suffering with illness. We may suppose that the sound was the old man's instinctive and inarticulate exclamation of surprise and alarm on awakening from his nap in his chair to find an intruder at his elbow. Next, and almost in the same breath, came the noise of a scuffle. Frightened at once, and yet eager to know what was passing, Nestoria gently turned the knob, pushed the door ajar, and looked into the room. What she saw was a blow, a gray head sinking under it, and a murderer bending over his victim. In the next instant all was darkness, at least to this horrified spectator. Either the study lamp was at that moment extinguished, or Nestoria temporarily lost the use even of her physical senses. She believed that she had screamed with all her strength, but the probability is that she did not give forth a sound, for it is certain that no one in the house heard a cry, and that the assassin quietly finished his purloinings. Although the girl could not afterward remember that she had fainted, there must have been a brief period of unconsciousness, or of stupor approaching to it. We know that under overwhelming oppression of fright or horror, conditions of spirit occur which may fairly be called waking nightmares. Men suddenly attacked by wild beasts or by Indians have been seen to stand paralyzed, staring at the approaching death without striving to repel it or even uttering an exclamation, as if in a state of catalepsy or bereft of reason. But it was not merely the sight of a shocking crime and the proximity of a mortal peril which had thus stunned Nestoria. Dreadful as these things were to innocence and defencelessness, they were surpassed in outrage by a grisly revelation. She had recognized, beyond the possibility of questioning, the face of the assassin; she had seen it as the countenance of the man who but a moment before had possessed her heart; she had not a doubt that the deathblow had been dealt by the hand of Edward Wetherel. No wonder that she stood, or it may be lay, beside this tragedy, palsied, speechless, and taking no more part in the scene than if she had been a ghost; no wonder that for a few seconds, or perhaps for several minutes, she was as powerless as the very spirit of the murdered man, as inaudible and unprotesting. But presently an instinct came to life in her. It was a sentiment of shuddering, of aversion, of recoil. She became aware that she was in darkness, and that through that darkness the murderer was approaching. It was not fear of death which led her to retreat before him, but a sense that she could not bear to be near him, and that it would kill her to have him speak to her. In her stupefied horror, or, as we might fairly call it, her insanity, she was only conscious of a desire to avoid recognition. This man, whom she had lately loved, and whom she had just seen performing the work of a demon, how could she possibly address a word to him, or hear him call her by name? Dazed, almost senseless, and conscious mainly of loathing, she retreated mechanically before the steps which stealthily picked their way through the obscurity, as Christiana, if left alone in the Dark Valley, might have shrunk back before the audible oncoming of Apollyon. Presently she reached a door, and felt that it was open. She opened it wider, passed noiselessly through it, and found herself in the outer air. A few stars glimmered faintly between driving clouds, and a wild, sultry wind shook all the ghostly branches of the trees. Of a sudden her physical strength returned to her, and she fled at full speed, without reflecting whither, her only thought being to avoid the fallen angel who haunted her steps, and to escape the task of saying to him, I know you for a devil! With just the intelligence of a scared animal, she followed a path which she had often traversed both by daylight and moonlight, descended a steep slope of the little bluff on which the house stood, and reached the shore. The sombre, indistinct, limitless sea was at her feet; its enormous mystery attracted her as it has attracted many other wretched hearts; it seemed to her as if it offered a refuge. On the land she had met shipwreck, and she looked for mercy to the waters. A boat was at hand; she must wade knee-deep in order to reach it; but in another minute she had climbed or fallen into it; then the moorings were unlashed, and she was adrift. Nestoria had now evaded the awful interview, the fear of which had driven her abroad; and, no longer upheld and impelled by the strength of terror, she lost her consciousness; this time, there can be no doubt, she really fainted. No pursuer came; no one was at hand either to destroy or save; and in a few minutes the senseless girl was far from shore. The gale, it must be said, did not threaten her safety immediately, for it blew off the land, and where she now was raised no sea. The boat in which she lay was one of those large skiffs which are known in the neighborhood of New Haven as âsharpies,â and which are navigated by means of one or two slender triangular sails, and guided either by an oar in the stern or by a rudder. As the âsharpyâ is flatbottomed, and only draws a few inches of water, it is a fast craft in a light breeze, but risky in a heavy one. Nestoria's boat carried her out into the harbor and toward the meaning expanse of Long Island Sound. It kept head on, for the single mast was set well forward, and the imperfectly lashed sail, blowing out in a bellying pocket, afforded a sufficient hold to the wind. There was a false, transitory prosperity in the opening of this strange voyage, as there often is in the outset of flights which seek destruction. With just such fatal smoothness are captives in old poesy borne away by malignant magicians to imprisonment on undiscoverable islands or in the caves of ocean. The home which murder had polluted, the darkened room where a dear friend's reverend hair drooped into his own blood, the clandestine face of that flying Cain from whom this unconscious wanderer was escaping, the loved ones who would have sought to succor had they known how succor was needed, were easily and speedily left behind. The boat and its burden fluttered out afar from rescue upon a stormy sea. At last there was an awakening. Life, which sometimes seems a monster far more pitiless than death, dragged the girl back to suffering. At first she did not know where she was, nor remember what had happened to her. She was aware only of darkness, of solitude and abandonment, of an uneasy and alarming movement, of a sense of utter helplessness. Of a sudden the past struck her like a blow, and for a few moments she covered her face from it with her hands, unobservant or careless of the frightful present. Then the increasing and rapidly recurring roar of the surges, and the jerking, plunging action of the boat as it entered the wilder waters beyond the bar, called her to a sense of her strange situation. The storm of shocking recollections in her soul subsided a little as the storm of relentless nature around her became more audible, agitating, and menacing. Still amazed, even in the midst of her affright, she sat up and looked about her. She could see little. The rare and feeble stars, which seemed to swim like wrecked sailors amid billowy clouds, had scant power of revelation. Around her was tempestuous blackness, stretching away on every hand into infinity. Even the snowy crests of the waves were only visible in a dim, spectral way, and for a brief distance. The boat she could perceive, and the white ghost of the struggling sail flying before her like a lost spirit, a guide ominous of a grave. Holding by the handle of the leaping rudder, which had struck her arm with a sort of spasmodic monition, as if urging her to seize it and exert its spell, she turned and gazed, half-blinded, into the face of the gale. On her left, but far behind her, she distinguished the red gleam of the lighthouse, now darkening and now brightening as if signalling her to return. She knew at last where she was, and comprehended what had befallen. In this uttermost strait of sorrow and peril, flying from a paradise because she had seen it changed into a hell, shrinking from sudden death and yet scarcely desiring rescue, Nestoria bowed her head to pray. It was the prayer of the shipwrecked, a petition which the remorseless sea has so often mocked, changing it into a shriek of despair. A tumult of fighting waves reeled into the boat, and in another moment the girl was struggling for life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. A SALVATION FROM THE SEA. THE love of life, that instinct which seems to strengthen just in proportion as invading death cuts intelligence down to the bare root of sensation, enabled and forced Nestoria to hold fast to the wreck of her shallop, and to struggle to keep her head above the waters. Whether dissolution were not more tolerable than existence, whether it would not be well to drop out of a world which had suddenly been changed for her into a place of torment, she did not for an instant consider. Amid tossings, buffetings, whirlings, and suffocations, she labored with her whole surviving strength to climb out of the abyss which howled and sucked beneath her, slowly fighting her way to the uncertain asylum of the inverted hulk, and clinging there with a sort of unintelligent tenacity, like a thing of inanimate nature. The slit in the keel for the centre-board offered a hold to her fingers, and by means of this she stayed herself against the pushings of the billows. A long time she remained thus; far longer than she had thought possible. After nature has done all it seemingly can, necessity endows it with force to do more. The power of the dying to resist death exceeds every energy known to ordinary life, and borders closely upon miracle. Presently a light came over the sea; her first wild impression was that help must be at hand; but it was only the distant, alien rising of the moon. We can picture her now to our eyesight, as well as to our sensibilities. We have a vision of one who, though beaten and worn and sorrowful and desperate, was rarely and one might say shiningly beautiful. Her long golden hair, flung loose by the wind and the waves, blew out in tremulous glistening streamers, like quivering strands torn from the northern lights. Her face was as white as marble, but its delicate finish of feature was all the more obvious because of this Pentelican coloring, and its mute resignation was more touching than the agitated despair of the daughters of Niobe. The moon took pity on her, and lighted her up with exceeding tenderness, and showed her forth as an unequalled sacrifice. In all the earth there was not perhaps at that moment another victim of disaster so fair to look upon and so fashioned to command compassion. Both in beauty and in pathos she may have been for a time without a rival. Her thoughts meanwhile were on far other things than her own merits and admirableness. Half confounded as she was by the outrages of the sea and by her weakness, she was striving to prepare herself for entrance into that other world which seemed so near; she was groping in the dark gateway of illimitable mysteries for unearthly hands which should guide her out of all tempests into the great peace of eternal mercy. The past had fallen away from her; even the calamity which had driven her out vagrant appeared unsubstantial and long since bygone; she had almost forgotten that she had lived and loved to her disappointment and her hurt. The future only was real and urgent to her. Her lips moved, not in reminiscence nor in complaint, but in petition. âO God of our salvation, who art the confidence of them that are upon the sea, receive me!â she pleaded, as only the shipwrecked who are at their last breath are gifted to plead. Other such words thronged mercifully to her; they seemed to lift her like angels, in glorious, shining arms; they bore her lovingly through the waters which run between two worlds. The faith of her whole innocent life, the faith which had been taught her from infancy by the lips of her father, was now a mighty reality to her, and the only reality. All the rest of existence had become as a vision from which one awakens. But mortality had not yet lost its hold upon this waif of disaster. We have not ventured an absurdity in describing her as eye-witnesses, for human vision did find her out and human help reached her. In her extremity, just as her numbed fingers were losing their hold, and while the fantastic lights and music and tintinnabulations of the strange city of the drowning were already bewildering her senses, Nestoria became aware of the approach of some dark rolling bulk, out of which presently issued voices and a plashing of oars, all ending in rescue. She was lifted up the side of a vessel, and carried into a dimly-lighted cabin, and wrapped closely in blankets, and laid away. Next some stinging and heating liquid, the taste of which struck her as strange and disagreeable, was given her to drink. After that she lay quiet, though with a troublous sense of oscillation among billows, while her mind sank through shoals of reveries which grew more and more like dreams, until presently she was conscious of nothing. It was not the insensibility of a swoon, but of hard, immovable, vice-like sleep. She lay thus for hours, and when she awoke the sun was shining through the stern windows of the cabin, showing that the horrible night, a night which seemed years in duration, had at last ended. She was still wet, but she had no feeling of chillness, for the blankets and the summer heat made a warmth all about her, and slumber had revived the currents of youth in her veins. Raising herself with difficulty on one elbow, she looked about her with a dreamy, torpid gaze, like that of an awakening infant. A short and squarely built negro, slouchingly clad in garments much too big for him, and exhibiting that lowly and undeveloped physiognomy which almost surely indicates a southern black, rolled out of some unperceived lair and shambled toward her. âHow is you, miss?â he asked with a grin and chuckle which might have been supposed to express unrestrainable hilarity, but which he simply meant to be reassuring. âI am well,â replied Nestoria, with that languor and vacancy which we sometimes see in persons who have been very ill. âSorry we could'n keer fur you no better,â he continued, rolling his eyes around the rudely furnished cabin in an apologetical way. âAin't fixed up for ladies. Did'n have no dry clos' fur you, 'cause the' ain't no women folks aboard. Jes' done you up in them blankets, an' give you a horn o' whiskey, an' sont you to sleep. Done the bes' we could fur you, miss.â All this was said with such spasmodic wriggling and luminous grinning as if the peril and escape had been the broadest joke possible. âI am very much obliged to you,â murmured Nestoria. âYou's welkim, miss. Got blown off sho', did'n you? Was the res' of 'em drowned?â The girl shook her head. She could not enter upon the story of the hideous night. âWhere are you taking me to?â she presently inquired, not without a hope that it might be to distant eastern lands. âTo New Yawk,â said the negro. âWe's done got thar now, I guess. Don' ye hear 'em roundin' to? Capm is gwine ter drop you in New Yawk. 'cause this schooner is boun' souf, toâto some other placeâdon' know 'zactly whar she's boun.â âCan Iâpay you for saving me?â Nestoria timidly queried. The man hesitated; he quaked and wriggled from head to foot; in his physical way he was resisting temptation. âNo, I reckon not,â he at last responded, chuckling with unusual vehemence. âWe may want savin' ourselves some stormy night. You keep your money to git back whar you b'longs.â âGod reward you!â she whispered; and he reverently answered, âAmen!â By this time the schooner had lain to; and in a few minutes more Nestoria was placed in a small boat and landed on a gray, dingy, deserted dock; having actually seen but the steward and three sailors of the somewhat mysterious craft to which she owned her life. One is tempted to suppose a smuggler; and indeed there was a story current about that time of casks of merchandise being discovered in the Sound by traders who were singularly prepared for such a speculation in salvage; but, remembering what a moderate and rational tariff we are blessed with, the smuggling hypothesis is obviously untenable. Let us abandon useless suppositions and return to Nestoria. She remained for some minutes upon the dock, not knowing where in the wide world to go. To her the great city which lay beside her was as much a trackless wilderness as her native mountains of Kurdistan would have been to a New Yorker. Upon only one thing had she come to a resolution, and that was that she would never return to Sea Lodge. Sitting down where the sun could shine upon her still damp clothing, she buried her face in her hands, and pondered long upon her horrible past and perplexing future. It was still very early; business had not awakened, and the wharves and streets were silent; there was no one at hand to watch or disturb her. Would her situation overwhelm her, or would her character master the situation? The result proved that she had individuality enough to order events, instead of weakly submitting to them. She meditated with that seemingly unnatural calmness and that lucidity which fundamentally strong spirits discover in themselves under the pressure of disaster and despair. With an ease which at any other time would have surprised and alarmed her, she disposed of some mighty moral questions and decided upon her future course. When she at last rose to her feet and set forward alone into the unfamiliar mazes of New York, her steps might be uncertain, but not her mind. She had resolved to find a hiding-place, and to remain concealed in it until she could return to her father. She had said to herself that she would not bear witness against Edward Wetherel; that it might be the duty of others so to do, but that it could not be her duty; that she would never tell what she had seen, never, never! She wondered at herself for coming to such a determination, and once or twice the thought struck her that she must be insane, but for all that she did not waver. We will not pause to offer an apology for her which she did not offer for herself, nor enter upon the difficult query as to whether her decision were right or wrong. We propose simply to tell her story as it happened. She could not bear witness against the man whom she had loved; she could not aid in bringing him to death; she could not, and there was an end of it. The resolution was little more than instinctive, or at the highest it sprang from a root of pure emotion, but it was none the less inexorable. For once all her education of conscience, all her innate and acquired sense of duty, fell prostrate before a sentiment. Her life henceforward was to be a woful and perhaps a criminal problem. She did not think of that, but, drawing her thick green veil over her face, walked on in a quiet, business-like way, looking on every side for her desired hiding-place. It is stupefying to ponder upon such single-mindedness and simplicity. It is much as if one were asked in good earnest to watch the adventures of Jack the Giant Killer, or some other minute defier of monstrous potencies. Here was a child of nineteen, ignorant of the world in almost every manner of ignorance, and so topographically uninformed as to be at this very moment losing her way in Fulton Market, who yet proposed to baffle the New York police, the vast inquisition of public sentiment, and the Nemesis of ideal justice. It would not be easy to imagine a greater disproportion in contending forces. One is reminded of a water insect setting out to tread the rushings of Niagara. And yet it may be that water insects do skip over the thunderous cataract in safety. Long before the girl found the asylum of which she was in search she became languid with fatigue and hunger. She had no desire to eat, but she felt that she must take some food or drop in the streets, and it seemed to her that she could sip a cup of coffee. She looked timidly into the doors of various eating shops, but the masculine stares which saluted her drove her onward. Nowhere could she find a refectory frequented by her own sex; it was as if the world had decided that women must not eat in public; as if even in America the idea of the harem were dominant. The terrible isolation of the woman who has no home attended her feet and oppressed her soul. Lonely, sad, and weary, she wandered for two hours, slipping on the damp and foul pavements, winding through masses of merchandise which lumbered the sidewalks, and jostled by an ever-increasing crowd of hurrying men. All this time she was endeavoring to get into some other quarter of the city. Wherever she was, it appeared to her as if any place would be more friendly and more suitable for her purposes than the one in which she happened to be. At last she came to a great, rambling, sombre, sloppy market, encumbered with a monstrous traffic in edibles, and overrunning with purchasers and wayfarers. To her utter dismay she presently discovered that this was the same market which had perplexed her footsteps in the very beginning of her pilgrimage. For two hours she had feebly toiled away from it, and here she was once more in its undesired medley and uproar. But at least it offered her food; various stalls and shops sent forth an aroma of oysters and coffee; and in some of them there were women satisfying their morning hunger. She stole into one of these homely lairs, seated herself on a wooden stool without a back, and leaned her aching head against the grimy wall. âStew?â asked a sweaty attendant in a foul apron and rumpled paper cap. Nestoria nodded, and added in a whisper, âCoffee.â The food came, and she was making an attempt to eat, when a showy, well-dressed young woman, bearing in her hand a copy of the âNew York Spasmodic,â entered with a peculiarly brisk and assured air, and seated herself at the same table with the salutation, âI am so glad to see you here!â Fancying that she was recognized, Nestoria stared in terror at the intruder, ready to spring up and run away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. ROMANCE IN FACE OF REALITY. One glance at the young woman who had so abruptly and cheerfully addressed her convinced Nestoria that she was an entire stranger. The new arrival was stylish, and even rather boldly showy; and yet she was not unpleasing in either person or demeanor. She was slightly above the middle height of her sex, and seemed all the taller because she was slender almost to leanness; but she was noticeably easy and willowy in her movements, and, one might concede, graceful. Her dark-red hair was abundant and tastefully arranged; her tawny-hazel eyes were bright, and her complexion dazzlingly fair; her features were regular enough, and her teeth were of sparkling whiteness. Notwithstanding her brusque, confident address, and a certain twinkle of affectation and sentimentality which perked about the corners of her flexible mouth, her appearance was on the whole so much in her favor that it would have been difficult to decide at first glance whether she were or were not a person of good society and of culture. In age she might have been anywhere from twenty to twenty-three. âI never was here before,â said Nestoria, after one startled glance at this sociable apparition. âYou needn't be ashamed of being here,â replied the other with a prompt tartness, which, slight as it was, militated against her claims to high breeding. She had noticed the girl's involuntary recoil as if to fly, and had attributed it to mortified vanity at being caught in a Fulton Market oyster-shop, and had felt offended thereby. âI often take my morning refreshment in this place,â she continued, in a curiously stilted tone which was intended to be dignified and impressive. âThe people who eat here are just as nobly-natured as the minions of wealth who tread the high-piled velvety carpets of Delmonico's. Patrick, bring me a stew and coffee.â âI am not ashamed to eat here,â replied Nestoria, coloring under a reproof which seemed to her harshly hostile. Then, feeling keenly that she was hopelessly wretched and doubting whether she were not darkly criminal, she added in a mournful whisper, speaking to herself rather than to this stranger. âAny place on earth is good enough for me.â The other had already opened her copy of the âSpasmodicâ and settled herself to read the harrowing tale of âAngela's Revenge;â but on hearing this utterance of an undisguisable despair, she looked up in wonder and with an expression of honest though sentimental interest. âAnd have you seen better days?â she asked in her affected, melodramatic monotone, whimsical enough surely, but not devoid of sincerity. Nestoria made no answer, but she thought of a lost home and a lost love, and the tears brimmed her eyes. âPoo-o-or cheild!â murmured the subscriber to the âSpasmodic.â âHas the da-a-ark hand of misfortune been so insupportably heavy on thee?â She mouthed her words like an actress in a fourth-rate theatre. She was little less than ludicrous, and yet she meant to be truly sympathetic, and was doing her best to console. The homeless one still made no reply; her whole soul was busied in striving to quell her emotion; she was obliged to fight hard to repress sobs and convulsive twitchings. âPoo-o-or, poo-o-or distressed spirit!â continued the stranger, stretching a hand across the table and laying it on a quivering shoulder. âCanst thou not tell me thy sorrow?' âI have nothing to tell,â replied Nestoria, crushing more emotions in one breath than the other had known in her whole life. âLet us swear to respect each other's secrets,â exclaimed the sympathizer, with an enthusiasm which was strongly tinctured with romantic joy. âYou have a secret of deep and dark misfortune, and you shall not divulge it even to me, nor will I ask it. I also have my burden of woe. But let silence enfold it. Why don't you eat your stew?â âI will,â said Nestoria, and made a resolute attempt so to do, not from hunger, but to beat off faintness. The stranger meanwhile devoured crackers, oysters, and chopped cabbage with appetite, having no doubt found them by experience to be very supporting under burdens of woe. âShall I meet you here again?â she presently inquired. âI don't know,â replied Nestoria. âI don't know where I shall live.â âNo home, no labor, no object in life, no anchor of duty, no star of hope in the future?â sighingly queried the other. âI want a home,â said the friendless girl, looking up with a glimmer of hope in her piteous eyes. âCan you show me a place where I can live and work by myself? A cheap place?â âLet us be frank with each other,â exclaimed the tawny-eyed one, throwing out her hand in a manner which she conceived to be gracefully expressive or noble and generous emotion. âMy name is Imogen Eleonore Jones. What is yours?â âI wish you would be satisfied with calling me Nettie,â answered Nestoria, after hunting through her mind for a false name, and deciding that she could not assume one. âI will,â promised Miss Jones with delight. âThen you really, really have a secret! How fascinating and how pathetic! You shall never lack a friend while I live, and never, never will I ask your family name, nor interrogate you of your sorrow. You want to abide and labor alone. What can you do? Can you teach school? Oh, no, never! Then you would be seen and known; you would be the cynosure of the insolent, prying public eye; you can't teach.â âI can paint fans,â suggested Nestoria despairingly, for just then that industry seemed a feeble resource. âPaint fans,â repeated Miss Jones. âBut can you sell them after you have painted them?â she added with a practical sense which did not seem to be foreign to her real character, notwithstanding her melodramatic tones and phrases. âWell, if you can't, I can, or at least I will. I will hawk them from mart to mart, and bring you the proceeds of your Ã¦sthetic travail. Come with me. There is a chamber vacant next to mine. You shall abide in it, and I will be your lone sentinel. Have you any money?â âI have eighty dollars,â replied the confiding Nestoria. âIt will last a while,â said Miss Jones after a moment of business-like reflection, during which she cast up some small computation in her head. âAnd meantime we will beat the airs of fortune with your exquisite painted fans. What are you doing?â âI am going to pay for my breakfast,â explained Nestoria, fumbling for her purse. âI thought perhaps you were drawing a poniard,â observed Imogen Eleonore Jones, with a slight air of disappointment. âI was about to hold your hand, and exhort you to hope on, hope ever. But don't pay. Put up your little treasure. Let me defray the expenses of this fortunate interview. I have a salary of nine hundred dollars for teaching, and I have five hundred or so in bank, the savings of three long years. I insist upon paying for both.â Nestoria submitted; a salary of nine hundred dollars seemed immense to her; if she had possessed it, she would have undertaken to relieve the poor of an entire city. âNow let us buy some fruit,â continued Miss Jones, when she had wiped out the two modest accounts. âThis is my matutinal marketing, as well as my matutinal walk. I come hither to purchase peaches for my noon collation, because they are cheaper here than on the stalls up town. I take a light breakfast; then I take a light lunch of fruit and rolls; then I try every day to afford one good meal, my dinner. One has to economize, you know, on the salary of an instructor,â she explained with a courage for which we must honor her, so humiliating is that word âeconomyâ to many people of narrow incomes. âNow don't you buy anything for yourself,â she insisted. âI will market for two to-day. All I want is that you should carry your own paper of peaches, like a true, high-minded woman, who is conscious of her own dignity.â âI will carry both the parcels,â offered Nestoria, putting out her little hands. âNo, you shan't carry mine,â declared Miss Jones. âAnd you shan't carry yours either,â she added, while the tears of sympathy sprang into her eyes. âYou look so pale and weak I won't let you. Have you any baggage?â âI have lost everything,â replied Nestoria. âLost everything! And your dress is damp too!â exclaimed Imogen Eleonore. âWhy, you are wet clean through!â Then in a really awe-stricken whisper, âDid you try to drown yourself?â Nestoria pressed her veil over her mouth with a shaking hand, and made no reply. âI wish I could kiss you,â whispered Miss Jones, imperfectly suppressing a sob. âI wish all these people were not here staring. I want to kiss you.â After wavering to and fro a moment in her willowy way, she suddenly bent forward and placed a kiss on the green barege which covered Nestoria's forehead. In response a low, suffocated murmur came through the veil, âThank you.â âNow let us go,â said Imogen Eleonore, taking her protÃ©gÃ©e gently by the arm. âWe will take the street-cars. I generally walk up, for the exercise; but we will ride to-day.â By the time they were seated in a car this odd young woman had recovered her composure, and with it some of her stilted fashions of thought and utterance. âDo you know why I thought you were drawing a poniard from your bosom?â she asked in a sepulchral murmur. âSee here. I was perusing it as I came down to the market.â Unfolding her copy of the âSpasmodic,â she took out of it another fearfully and wonderfully illustrated production, a specimen half-sheet of the âWeekly Turtle Dove,â and read in her melodramatic fashion the following elegant extract: â `Allyne Castleton left the room, but returned again to look upon the sleeping object of his dreams, who had been that night so strangely restored to him, when he mourned her as sleeping beneath the fragrant roses of a hillside burial-place in sunny Naples. The soft, rich, velvet-piled carpets gave back no sound of his footsteps as he returned to his chamber-door, and he saw with horror his beautiful cousin Isabel, bending over his loved Angela, draw a gleaming dagger of exquisite workmanship from her bosom and lift her hand as if she would bury it to the hilt in the slumber-soothed bosom. The rest of this story will be found in'âwell, that's all,â said Imogen Eleonore. âBut that was the passage which filled my mind when I started so at beholding you put your hand into your neck. I expected as much as could be to see you produce a two-edged dagger with a handle of wrought and jewelled ivory.â Nestoria's only response to this talk was a slight recoil from the âWeekly Turtle Dove.â The story of an attempt to âmurder sleepâ brought back to her the horrible tragedy of the previous night. In spite of her efforts at self-control, she trembled as if she were in the chill fit of a fever. Imogen Jones drew a sigh of mingled compassion and satisfaction. She had not a doubt that her companion carried hid in her bosom a âgleaming dagger of exquisite workmanship,â wherewith to cut short surcease of sorrow, should it prove too burdensome. Such wretchedness enchanted her melodramatic imagination, and she actually envied Nestoria the distinction of possessing it. âPoo-o-or thing!â she whispered. âThou art indeed heavy laden. But fear not and fail not. I will guard thy secret and companion thee. None shall find thee out, nor harm thee. We will walk the ways of life unseen together. But, oh, what a light the works of genius cast upon this mystery of existence! Had it not been for my familiarity with the chefdoeevers of fiction, I should not have been able to at once divine your woes and put forth toward them the tendrils of my sympathy. I read every story I can find. I have piles and piles of the `Spasmodic' and the `Turtle Dove.' They will help you while away the long, long hours of your mysterious seclusion.â After what seemed to Nestoria a prodigious journey through a labyrinth of streets and turnings, Miss Jones imperiously shook her parasol at the conductor, and stopped the car. âWe are now near my abode,â she whispered mysteriously. âLet us alight.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. ANY PORT IN A STORM. The two young women alighted below Canal street, in one of those quiet quarters of the east side of the city which have been forsaken by whatever grandeur they once possessed, where dingy and dirty and unlovely tenement houses mingle with sombre and unpleasantly odorous storehouses, where fashionable ladies never go, and suppose that no one else lives. Turning into a narrow street, bordered by sloppy gutters and piles of garbage, and walking for some distance under the mildewing shadow of tall, unshapely, hard-visaged, discolored edifices, they halted before a plain, dolefully plain doorway, a mere rectangular opening in an ungarnished front of cold gray stone. âI have lodgings here,â said Miss Imogen, with an air which seemed to explain that it was only a temporary arrangement, and she should soon move into a castle. âI am sorry, on your account, that they are in the fourth story. But the air and light are so much better up there! Hold on to my arm as hard as you want to.â Up they went, clinging to dirty banisters, avoiding the flaky whitewash of neglected walls, and creaking along the bare floors of musty, not to say rancid passages. At last, breathless and tottering, Nestoria was ushered into a small furnished room, the combined parlor and bedehamber of Imogen Eleonore. It was not sumptuous, but it was less comfortless and forbidding than the approach to it had promised, for there was a carpet, a fresh and clean bed, and a small array of other decent chattels. âNow, the first chore is to dry you,â said Miss Jones, who was as simple and practical in some moments as she was stilted and sentimental in others. âYou'll have to go to bed till your clothes are dried, for in mine you'd look like a baby in a long gown. You fix yourself the best you can for repose while I light my gas-stove and make a dish of tea for you. I feel as though I was ministering to some survivor of a shipwreck. There is a beautiful passage in a story that I want you to read: something about how he lifted in his arms a white, white form, with a beautiful dead face and sweeping yellow hair, dripping, dripping ever, with the green seaweed tangled in its golden depthsâ Well, I won't tell any more,â she added, seeing that Nestoria was stopping her ears. âI mustn't spoil it for you.â There was a busy silence of a few minutes, during which the one girl prepared her âdish of tea,â while the other nestled into her resting-place. âSo you have retired, have you?â resumed Imogen Eleonore, turning to survey her guest. âWhat lovely hair you haveâsweeping yellow hairâgolden depths!â she went on, staring with admiration at Nestoria's abundant sunny tresses. âTruly the stranger within my gates is worthy of the hospitality of a castle. I wish I could treat you in a castle-like fashion, and wave my hand toward some vast hall full of servitors, and say, What ho, without there! more wine, page! But it must be tea or nothing to-day. Here it is on this little table, and here's your lunch, and there are the periodicalsâthe `Weekly Turtle Dove' and `Spasmodic'âall the back numbers for six months. I'll be back at three, and then we'll consider about dinner, and lay our plans for the future. You'll have to lock the door after me, and you must only open when I tap three times, twice quickly, and then once. Fear naught; your secret is safe. Adeu and o revore.â And with a wave of her hand, which she had caught from a sensational woodcut, the kindly, eccentric Imogen Eleonore departed. She went forth into a world of temptation, and she overcame it. She met people who would have been charmed to hear the story of her problematic guest, and she told them nothing. The mystery was to her a fountain of exquisite happiness and glory, too precious to be shared with such commonplace souls as all her friends now seemed to her. During the humdrum hours of her school-teaching, she had this nectar served in the most gorgeous halls of her imagination, and held incessant revelry over it. It was refreshment for the immortals, ennobling and aggrandizing her entire nature, and enabling her to look down upon her fellow âinstructors,â and even upon the principal. At last she had a finger in a romance, a real and thrilling and abysmal romance, an adventure which was not one bit like common life, an enigma as sombre and ghostly as any of the gooseflesh marvels of the âSpasmodicâ The matter gave her much thought as well as much gladness. What could be the spring, the awful motive force, the dark and deep first cause of this mystery? A false lover? A flinty-hearted father? An unintended crime? Aspirations too great for humanity? This strange, plaintive girl, who had made her apparition in Fulton Market as damp and as long-haired as a mermaid, had she escaped from the pirates who, as is well known to readers of weekly literature, haunt the waters of New York bay, or had she simply come forth from an unavailing attempt at suicide? Well, whatever the precise realistic bottom of the business might be, it was on the surface a solemn, tremendous, fascinating, luxurious mystery. As Imogen Eleonore went about her arithmetical and geographical tuitions that morning, she constantly murmured in the recesses of her soul, âOh, enigma! enigma!â Keep the secret? Yes, by all that was romantic and sentimental; by all those tender heroines who had pined away in the pages of the âTurtle Dove,â and those queenly ones who had died at the feet of the ensanguined columns of the âSpasmodic;â by all the tears and pantings and long-drawn screams that she had read of as âto be continued in our next.â The very extravagances of this fantastic schoolma'am made her one of the securest confidantes and most zealous protectors which all our motley humanity could have furnished for Nestoria. Her educational duties performed, Miss Jones hurried homeward with breathless speed, and found her protÃ©gÃ©e dressed. âI am so relieved!â she gasped. âI had a fearful presentiment that you had flown. Are your garments dry? Well, now, let us discourse the thrilling future. An idea struck me as I wended my way homeward, by which we can save filthy lucre. Instead of taking a room for yourself, why not share mine?â âOh, thank you,â answered Nestoria. âI could not bear, not yet a while, to live alone.â âPooâr, poor cheild!â murmured Imogen Eleonore. âSolitude and darkness would add to the horror of thy obscure, unshared sorrow.â âDo not speak of it, I beg of you,â implored Nestoria, her face quite pale. âNever, nevermore!â promised Miss Jones in her most exalted manner. âNever again shall that drear topic pass the sealed portal of my lips. The past no more! Henceforward we will live for the future. Well, now about dinner?â she continued, relapsing into her earthly tone. Dinner they obtained in a cheap little restaurant, one of many in New York which are unknown to fame, and which deserve to remain so. It was a shop or âsaloonâ of moderate dimensions, the front crowded with tables and chairs which in diminutiveness and fragility resembled insects, and the rear cut up into narrow alcoves, where the very atmosphere seemed oleaginous and nourishing. On their arrival they found most of the tables already occupied by people who were evidently of the class which must glance at the cost of a dish before ordering it. There were gentlemen, for instance, who were clerks or mechanics, and ladies who were school-teachers, or milliners, or otherwise industrial. They talked little, as is the time-saving fashion of Americans in feeding, and appeared to find their chief social enjoyment in looking at each other in a dumb, unobtrusive way, like so many sheep or other ruminating animals at pasture. Through these tranquil revellers, as silent as the old fellows whom Rip Van Winkle encountered among the Catskills, Miss Jones made her way with an air of secrecy which was equivalent to wearing an iron mask, pursing her thin lips with lofty firmness, and glancing neither to right nor left. Nestoria, her face hidden by a green veil, and every nerve trembling with fear of discovery, followed close. They dined in one of the nutritive alcoves, keeping the ragged curtains drawn upon the world. The waiter suspected nothing illegal; at least he brought no policeman. The prandial problem was solved for that day, and for many days succeeding. On the way homeward they bought a few fans, colors, and brushes, such as Nestoria needed to commence her small industry; and all the evening she painted, while Imogen Eleonore watched her in admiration, or read tremendous serials to her out of the âSpasmodic.â âWhy, it's beyuâti-ful!â exclaimed this easily-moved young woman, when a partially finished fan was spread before her, splendid with a bordering of roses and lilies. âWhat a lovely pattern of gorgeous hues and labyrinthine verdure! It reminds me of enchanted gardens of delights, too fairâfar too fair âfor earth. You must teach me how to do this sort of work.â âI will show you all I know,â said Nestoria. âNot so!â resolutely answered Miss Jones, after a moment of severe reflection. âI have my own sphere, and I will not intrude upon yours.â It had occurred to her that if she once began to paint fans, her genius would impel her to paint them as no other woman ever did or could, and so she should drive her little guest out of the market. That, of course, she might never, never do; and she must resist the very beginnings of temptation. âFarewell, art!â she continued, waving her maguanimous right hand. âFarewell the bright sunlights and rich clouds of the Ã¦sthetic! Hail, geography and arithmetic! To your anstere mysteries I dedicate my powers.â What did Nestoria, what could the entirely artless, sincere Nestoria think of this whimsical companion? She marvelled at her; she was as much perplexed by Miss Imogen Eleonore as a lamb might be by a monkey or a chicken by a parrot; but, while she found her passing strange, she did not find her ridiculous. It was not in the child's serious and kind nature to discover absurdity in that mysterious medley which she had been taught to call âpoor humanity,â nor to make of any fellow in the solemn pilgrimage of life an object of lightminded mirth. Furthermore, she was profoundly grateful to this good Samaritan in calico who had given her shelter and sympathy; and had she been capable of detecting aught ludicrous in her ways, she would not have laughed at it; she would as soon have made sport of the bald head of Elijah. No such thoughtless or disrespectful young person was she as were those two and forty who were torn by the bears. The two girls were now fairly launched on a hermit-like existence, such as Nestoria's position demanded. Amid the busy and incurious million of New York they led the life of the proverbial needle in the haymow. Early every morning they took a long walk in the unfrequented down-town streets, breakfasting in Fulton Market or some similar resort of slender purses, and bringing home their modest lunches. Then Imogen went off to âinstruct,â and Nestoria sat down to her painting. Afterward came a dinner in some romantic alcove; then another promenade in the friendly gloom of twilight; then what Miss Jones styled âa soirÃ©e of art and literature.â It was a monotonous life, but it was mysterious, and, in the schoolma'am's opinion, delightful. There was no danger of disturbance and discovery because of visitors. Imogen Eleonore, like many assiduous readers of fiction, was disposed to seclusion; she had not been in the habit, as she frequently said, of mingling with the common herd of mankind; she had found the elevating society of heroes and heroines abundantly sufficient for her; she had loved to walk alone in the halls of fancy and the enchanted gardens of revery. Fans, a flowery half-dozen of them, were painted in a week or so, and Miss Jones put them under her waterproof and âhawked them from mart to mart,â as she had valiantly promised. It was new business to her, and she might have scorned it as very low business, only that it was ennobled to her mind by a mystery. Was she not befriending the heroine of some dark and doubtless thrilling tragedy? Uplifted by this thought, she entered a âfancy storeâ with the air of a duchess in disguise, and fairly cowed the dealer into giving her merchandise a respectful consideration. Still, he did not want to buy; it was a âline of goods,â he said, that he had never seen before; nor did he believe such an article would be called for. But just then two customers, a dark-eyed and showy young lady of twenty, and a tall, handsome, blonde dandy of nearer thirty, entered the shop. They were talking earnestly, and otherwise had an air of being interested in each other, so that Imogen Eleonore immediately speculated in her mind as to whether they were lovers. I believe it may be stated, by the way, that a woman scarcely ever sees two young people together without trying to form some idea as to their heart affairs. âWhat beautiful fans!â exclaimed the lady. âOh, Count Poloski, just look at them. Are those for sale?â âI was just taking the lot, Miss Dinneford,â bowed and smiled the dealer. âFinish your bargain and then let me have one,â said Alice, little guessing whose handiwork it was that she coveted. So, the Count and Alice withdrawing a little, the fans were bought at a dollar and a half apiece, to be resold at three dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. IN THE DEPTHS. Miss Imogen Eleonore Jones hurried back joyfully and vaingloriously to Nestoria with the proceeds of her traffic. âBehold the dawn of fortune!â she exclaimed, holding the bank-bills exultingly aloft, and otherwise making an impressive tableau of herself, such as one heroine should present in addressing another, especially when the first heroine is the protector of the second. Nestoria counted the money in amazement, and was thankful and for a moment happy over it, seeing in her earnings a promise of other prosperities, and, above all, of escape. âOh, I will work night and day, night and day,â she murmured, meanwhile trying to compute in her excited brain how long it would be before she would have enough to take her to her distant home. âHow well you have done my errand!â was her next thought. âI am so deeply obliged to you!â âNot so,â protested Miss Jones, striving, though in vain, to bear her mercantile honors meekly. âIt was the beauty of your fans which gave me success. A young lady who was in the shop pronounced them exquisite, and purchased one immediately. I think the name of your first patron is worthy of being entered upon the tablets of your memory. It was a Miss Dinneford, and her first name is Alice, for I heard a gentleman call her so who was with her, and I think he was an admirer.â A haunting ghost, the terror of discovery, suddenly slid close up to Nestoria, followed oy all those other menacing phantoms which belonged in its train. She heard the feet of pursners, and saw herself haled into halls of justice, and there either denounced as a bloodstained criminal, or forced to bear deadly evidence against Edward Wetherel. âDid you tell her anything about me?â she asked in a faint, eager voice. âYou do not yet know me,â replied Miss Jones, almost offended. âNever for one instant have I forgotten my vow to hide your solemn secret. Some day you will do me justice.â âI hope I have not pained you,â pleaded Nestoria fearful of losing her only friend. âI am too much occupied with myself. And yet, if you knewââ She stopped. Her calamity was of such a nature that she could not ask for sympathy under it. She must hide her face from all human beings but one, and from that one she must hide her soul. Oppressed with a sense of utter isolation and abandonment, it seemed to her as if she were an ordained and sealed outcast, a second Cain. An actual assassin could hardly have felt keener terror and remorse than did this innocent girl who had never even wished harm to one of her fellow creatures. Of all the ugly features of sin, perhaps the ugliest is this, that it often causes the guiltless to suffer with the guilty, and sometimes in place of the guilty. Every evil act has its possible rebounds which may strike down those who least deserve punishment. For a few moments it seemed to Nestoria that she could not endure this unshared torment; and she was nearly driven to making a confidante of her chance intimate, and telling the whole story of the Wetherel tragedy. But the thought of exposing Edward, the thought of bringing the man whom she had loved to a shameful death, the thought of being obliged to look upon him while she should utter her damning testimonyâthese frightful possibilities struck her dumb. In no manner, neither through confession nor complaint, must she relieve herself ever so little of the burden which had been laid upon her by one who owed her all the happiness in his gift. Under this burden she had tottered a little; but in a minute or so she was steady again; she turned quietly and silently to her painting. It was a prodigious exhibition of tenacity, of magnanimity, and, perhaps we may venture to add, of heroism. A few days earlier in her life she would not have believed herself possessed of such endurance. Her character was one of those which are capable of almost indefinite development under adversity, suffering, and combat. It is a proof of her practical ability, as well perhaps as of her ignorance of the great, perplexing world in which she had lost herself, that she had one simple plan of action and never swerved from it. To keep concealed until she could earn money enough to take her back to her father, had been her first purpose, and she conceived no other. She had the singleness of intent which marks a child, or a dog, or a cat, who, having got into trouble abroad, thinks only of making homeward. There were no wild hopes that some wandering fairy of a chance would favor her; there were no dreamings that she would some day find an unexpected friend able and willing to rescue. She had her single, fixed scheme of escape, to be carried out by herself; and she clung to it as firmly as in her shipwreck she had clung to the tossing boat. As soon as she had sold a second batch of fans she took a room by herself. Money was indescribably precious, but the chance of thickening her concealment was more so, and she had recovered from her first terror of solitude. Indeed, one cogent reason why she wished to live alone was her need of se clusion for meditation and devotion. She had a conflict to maintain, not only with fears of discovery and with a sense of outlawry, but also with her sleep less, scrupulous, and hostile conscience. An unappeasable and menacing voice continually charged her with guiltiness for hiding the guilty from justice. She had not obeyed her sense of duty, but had hearkened to the pleadings of her natural heart, a counsellor which she knew to be deceitful and desperately wicked. In this matter she had done evilly from the beginning; and, what was far more dreadful, she persisted in her unrighteousness. That imperious inward voice, a monitor which was the more dreadful because hitherto she had always striven to obey it, called upon her to repent of her iniquity of silence, and to turn from it or perish. But such a turning, to be honest and thorough and salvatory, signified nothing less than the denouncing of Edward Wetherel. This was a cross of such exceptional weight, and sharp with such a promise of lifelong wretchedness, that she could not take it up. Scourged by her conscience, she approached it again and again, only to reject it passionately or to seek some way of evading it. Then a new proclamation of guilt resounded, and she heard herself judged as one of the hardened impenitent. All the sources in which she had hitherto found comfortable guidance and hope were now turned into springs of condemnation and threatening. One of her first purchases after reaching her asylum had been a Bible; and hour by hour she turned over its leaves in search of some word which would justify her in her resolution of secrecy; but she found no text to which she could cling for more than a minute at a time. Shining promises came toward her in garments of peace, but once close at hand changed into accusing angels. She was like a person who attempts to cross a river on an ice-float, and who must continually leap from one sinking, shivering fragment to another. At one time she sought to uphold herself by persistently repeating that broadest of forgiving utterancesâthat pardon which demands not even repentance for the past, but only reformation for the future: âNeither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.â But this refuge, like all the others, grew thin, crackled under her feet, and vanished, leaving her in deep waters. The pastâthat brief, happy past of lovingâbecame as dreadful as the present, and only less dreadful than the future. It seemed to be shown to her that her calamity was a retribution for giving her heart to a man who had not given his heart to righteousness. She had been taught to believe in a special providence; to believe that the Creator watches over every act of every one of his creatures; to believe that he incessantly chastens the good and punishes the wicked. It was clear enough to her that her ways had been followed up by Omniscience, and that she was suffering a castigation either of mercy or of judgment. Which? How could it be mercy while she continued in her sin? She must altogether give up that unholy affection, and she must repent of having ever indulged in it. Here, as it seemed to her, she found duty somewhat easier, at least for a time. She affirmed that she did not love Edward Wetherel now; that she could not possibly love a man who was a murderer; that the mere thought of such a love filled her with horror. As to the past, too, she professed repentance, prostrating herself in humiliation because of it, and confessing that her chastisement had been merited. For a day or two she had a comforting sense that on this point she had cleared her conscience. But then, like a spectre rising out of a grave, appeared this horrible accusation: âBecause you hide this man's guilt and shield him from justice, therefore it must be that you still love him; in some secret and evil recess of your heart there is still an unholy remnant of affection.â âNo, no, no!â she protested in agony; and thereupon a pitiless voice answered: âExpose him; surrender him to the gallows.â Nothing would answer except that she should come out before the world and denounce Edward Wetherel as a murderer. Her conscience demanded it; her innate sense of the claims of human justice demanded it; every near or distant sound of the great city around her seemed to require it; the ghost of Judge Wetherel arose before her mind and added its grisly urgency. There were times when every passer-by who glanced at the house had in her eyes the air of saying to himself âHere is a place where blood is hidden.â There were other times when she saw before her the awful bar of the Final Judgment, and heard an unearthly voice inquire: âWhen thou art come hither, wilt thou still be silent?â There was no end to this beating of remorseless behests; it was a fiery tempest which never ceased and seldom lulled. She was almost continually blown up and down gloomy abysses, like the unresting spirits whom Dante saw in the second circle of the Inferno, among whom was that Francesca who gave all for love. If any passage of those Scriptures, to which she vainly looked for comfort, came to her oftener than any other, it was the declaration. âThere is no peace for the wicked.â At times it appeared to her that she could not possibly bear her burden longer unassisted; that, since it would not come off at the foot of the cross, she must absolutely appeal to human help. She wrote to her father, not knowing that he was dead, not knowing that this last refuge had been closed to her. She wrote out the whole story of that tragedy which had murdered her venerable friend and her own girlish peace. She filled pages on pages with the hideous narrative, and then read them to herself as well as she could for weeping. No other eye ever beheld the letter; she could not bring herself to mail it. Nor did she dare keep it long, for the thought came to her that justice might discover it, and she burnt it to the last shred. Then she wrote another letter saying nothing of her gloomy situation, nothing of her whereabouts. What a struggle it was to chat of commonplaces when her whole mind was full of calamity and horror! She merely intimated that she did not find America agreeable, and that she might yet be led to ask leave to return home. She added that she was with a friend; and with that vague statement she closed. This wretched epistle she sent, praying to be forgiven for its prevarications, or rather its suppressions of the truth, but finding no justification for them even in necessity, so scrupulous was her sore conscience. Meantime she labored without ceasing, for her trouble of mind made her all the more eager to earn money enough to fly with, and furthermore her work was enough of a distraction to be somewhat of a consolation. In the artistic anxiety of touching a rose with its healthfullest flush or a lily with its saintliest purity, she could forget by moments that her soul was sick with sorrow and stained with sin. Oh, the comfort that innumerable hosts of fearing and mourning ones have found in enforced industry! If the fallen inhabitant of Eden had not been condemned to live by the sweat of his brow, his chastisement would not have been diminished, but exaggerated. It was also a blessing to Nestoria, a blessing in the guise of a cruelty, that she was forced to hide her griefs. There is less good in confession, and more good in silent self-control, than is generally supposed. The first is often a weakening habit, and the second an invigorating effort. The girl's heart almost burst in her struggle to appear tranquil under the eyes of her fellow lodger; but through this solitary and painful wrestle she was slowly forming the solid moral fibre which constitutes character. She had been rather more than a fortnight in her seclusion, her hands busy with their graceful industry and her soul with its terrible combats, when an incident occurred which was of far more moment than she could then suspect. Closely veiled, she was returning from a walk in search of painting materials, when she met in the passage which led to her room a stranger of peculiar appearance, a man of little more than dwarfish stature, with a remarkably large head and plain features. Fearful of every one, her first impulse was to avoid him and take refuge in her own apartment. But in this homely face and even in the carriage of this insignificant figure there was an influence which would not let her turn her back curtly. The stranger's expression was one of touching humility and resignation, and also of that benevolence which noble natures evolve out of suffering. The smile which lighted up the coarse mouth had such a sweetness as one might attribute to the smile of a pitying seraph. With the quick insight of a sensibility which has pondered over calamities, Nestoria divined the man of sorrows who has learned to pity the griefs of others. Eager for sympathy and help, she felt an instantaneous impulse to trust this man, and to wish that she knew him. Thus when he took off his hat and approached her, she did not seek to avoid him. âI beg your pardon, miss,â he said in a voice as tender and appealing as his smile. âBut may I presume to inquire of you as to an old acquaintance of mine? Does Miss Imogen Jones still live here?â âShe does,â replied Nestoria. âBut she will not be in for some hours. Can I deliver a message to her for you?â âI thank you,â bowed the visitor. âBe pleased to say that Mr. Walter Lehming called on her, and that he proposes to take his old rooms in the building. I regret that I have no card, and must trouble you to remember the name. If you should forget it, you can describe my appearance to her, and she will know who came.â This allusion to the oddity, and in plain terms the deformity of his figure was so simple and humble and uncomplaining that it completely captivated Nestoria's sympathy. âI shall not forget the name,â she said in a tone of respect; and here we must call distinctly to mind the fact that she had never heard it before: for Alice Dinneford had only mentioned Lehming as âCousin Walter.â He bowed his thanks and departed, moving away in an unobtrusive and and noiseless fashion, such as one may remark in the deformed who are meekly conscious of their deformity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. PERILOUS ACQUAINTANCES. WHEN Imogen Eleonore returned home and was informed of the visit which had been paid her, her vanity was so much gratified thereby that she made an upright grand piano of herself and executed one of her most thrilling solos. âMy soul is rejoiced to hear that he purposes to come here,â she discoursed standing up loftily and elocutionizing in a way that was really dreadful. âWalter Lehming is a dwarf in stature, but he is a towering giant in genius, and a sweet cherub in heart. Only he of all the millions of earth have I found gifted and empowered to soothe the keen blackness of my soul in its hours of solitary sorrow, and to teach me the sublime lesson of improving my mind and elevating my morale by practice in English composition. To him I owe it that days which would otherwise have been dour and drear were transformed into glowings of beatific sunshine. To him, much more than to my own diffident merits, do I owe my station as an instructor. I rejoice that he is to be of us.â âCan I see him sometimes?â asked Nestoria with a timorous and piteous wistfulness. âI thought he seemed very good, and I thought I should like to hear him talk.â âIntercourse with him would cheer, entrance, and elevate you,â affirmed Imogen Eleonore, conscious that she herself had acquired eminence of feeling and intellect. âMy poor, lonely little Nettie, thou shalt know this noble man, and he shall be thy friend.â âWill it be safe?â queried Nestoria, pondering over her terrible secret. âWalter Lehming may be trusted,â replied the schoolmistress. âIf he knew all, he would tell naught. The mysteries of angels and demons might be confided to his great heart, and there they would eternally remain, wrapt in pity and silence.â From all this grandiose babble, the oddity and absurdity of which she did not very plainly note, Nestoria gathered that it would be safe for her to meet her friend's friend, and that she might find in him a comfortable companion. It was very depressing to be so much alone as she was, and to have no more uplifting converse than that of a âconstant readerâ of the âSpasmodie.â While she did not scorn her fellow-lodger, and had begun to regard her with the affection which in meek spirits springs from a sense of obligation, she did find her somewhat limited in mind and vapid in discourse. They two stood to each other in the relation of a superior and an inferior, the former unconscious of her superiority, and the latter of her inferiority. Thus there was content, but not the highest content; and Nestoria craved betterment, provided it could be had without peril. In a few days Lehming moved into the tenement-house, bringing with him the transcendental John Bowlder. It must be understood that the Wetherel estate was still far from being settled, and that Lehming had as yet positively refused to receive any advances from it. The Dinneford ladies, oppressed by the sombreness of the Judge's old house in Brooklyn, and incessantly haunted there by its associations with their murdered kinsman, had abandoned it and rented a modest dwelling in New York. Bowlder and Lehming had not accompanied them: it did not seem best to them that two men should abide with two women, though invited; and thus they had been led to establish themselves in lodgings. They took three rooms on the same floor with Imogen and Nestoria, thus completing the occupation of the passage. These plain and even mean apartments they fitted up in plain fashion, as became men of small incomes. One was Lehming's bedroom, another was devoted to the transcendental dreamings of John Bowlder, and the third was a parlor and study. âThis door must be always open,â said Lehming after he had put the study in order, lined its dingy walls with his coarse book-shelves and strewn the green baize of its centre-table with periodicals. âThis must be the reading-room of all our fellow-lodgers.â âYou are right, Walter,â agreed John Bowlder in his hearty, sonorous way. âThere must be no monopoly of culture. What store of knowledge we have is not ours only, but our friends' also. I think little of books. Man is a god; he is greater than his works; he is worthier of my study. But the written volume ballasts and impels the mind which has not yet learned to steer its own course. Your thought is an inspiration of beneficence.â âThe room is admirably fitted for the purpose,â continued Lehming, rising on the toes of his pygmy shoes and looking about him with satisfaction. âIt could not have been better planned for it. If it opened into my bedroom, it would have an air of privacy, and could hardly be made hospitable. But its only entrance is from the public passage, by which all the world may come. We will make all the world welcome.â âI could wish you would accept of opulence, Walter,â said John Bowlder, honestly admiring his deformed friend. âThe world would profit by it. Each man has his vocation, and the talent is the call to it. Yours is philanthropy, as mine is insight.â Lehming took no notice of the allusion to the fortune which awaited his beck. âI want the aid of your insight,â he smiled. âThere are two young ladies on this floor who must be tamed to enter this room and use whatever they find in it. I want you to help me bait them with hospitality.â âWe will call on them and entreat them,â declared Bowlder. âWe will bring them in hither by the hand, as you lead homeless children into your Sunday-school. Let us go to them at once. The man is no man who waits to do anything, though it be no more than the boiling of an egg, a single minute after it can be done. The punctual, prompt soul is the able soulâwhat foolish people call the man of talent. But the wise know him merely as one who dawdles not.â Then he began to improvise, in a queer singing way that he had, not specially wonderful for melody, chanting the following wondrous rune: âDawdler, dawdler, dawdle not; Hear the bubbling of the pot; Stir it while the fire is good; So your mess shall turn to food.â John Bowlder had made bales and bales of such verses, which in his moments of presumption he tried to hope were equal to those of Emerson, or at least conceived in their spirit. Like many men who long to be original, he was instinctively and even to a certain extent consciously an imitator, and was generally doing his whimsical best to reflect the peculiarities of some admired model, with such fantastic and farcical results as you may behold in a âcrazyâ looking-glass. As his unbroken bass voice gambolled through his ârune,â so his clumsy bulk rolled and rumbled along the passage. Ahead of it glided the little figure of Lehming, like a stunted pony drawing a large wagon. It was very much thus that they went through life: the dwarf guided, while the giant did the bellowing. It must be understood that Miss Jones had so arranged her own room as to be able on a pinch to receive visitors in it. She had divided it into two compartments by means of a lofty though fragile rampart of paper screen, which completely environed her bed and washstand with its gaudy representation of scarlet ships on a blue-vitriol ocean, so that nothing could well be more seemly and genteel at the price. Thus she was in a state of decorous preparation for the two gentlemen, and could admit them without going through any preliminary housewifery. Indeed, she was waiting for them, and opened at the first tap of Lehming's knuckles, so that John Bowlder, who was just about applying his battering-ram of a fist to the door, missed his mark and nearly gave the schoolma'am a facer, immediately stumbling into the room in his usual headlong fashion. However, he lurched to before he had run down the ships on the paper screen, and was tugged without accident into a proper state of introduction to his hostess. âMiss Jones, this is Mr. John Bowlder,â said Lehming in his simple, well-bred way. âHe is an old friend of mine, and wishes to be a friend of yours.â âI welcome you, Mr. Bowlder, to my humble cot,â responded Imogen Eleonore in her most unhuman, grand-piano manner. âIn the inane wilderness of brick and mortar which billows and throbs around us there are many, many abodes far more palatial than this, but none, surely none, in which you would be received with a simpler, more earnest, more heartfelt cordiality.â The effect of this speech was somewhat like that of the opening of the seventh seal; there was a silence of perplexity and amazement, though not for the space of half an hour. Imogen Eleonore had keyed herself up to such a lofty pitch, and had uttered her greeting in such an unnatural and absolutely untenable tone, that for a moment she could not say a word further, and merely stood panting. John Bowlder, reduced to stark plainness and lucidity by an affectation which overtopped his own, simply mumbled, âMiss Jones, I thank you.â He was much in the condition of a rooster who should find himself outcrowed by a hen. He could not transcendentalize in the presence of such a transcendent young woman. Meekly accepting a hard-bottomed chair, he stared with the utmost circumference of his great blue eyes at Imogen, postponing discourse until he could make up his mind how to take her. Never before, since he became a philosopher, had he found so little good in âinsight.â For a short period it seemed to him as if neither he nor any one else would ever speak again. The sensible and kindly little Lehming came to the rescue of these two great spirits. He saw the need of pouring the oil of mediocrity upon the billows of sublimity, and reducing the conversation to a navigable level for human possibilities. In his silvery, placid way he remarked, âWhat a cosy old rocking-chair this is! It reminds me of my grandmother's.â But Imogen Eleonore's surging nature was not to be calmed at once. She was laboring under a sense of duty to herself, and to the sacred rites of hospitality. It was necessary to present her young lady friend to the two gentlemen in a manner suitable to the heroine of a mystery. Walking to the door of Nestoria's room with a gait like that of a stage duchess retiring through an âupper entrance,â she tapped, opened, and said in what she supposed to be a thrilling murmur, âNettie, my dear, come forth.â The answer to this ridiculous summons was a piteous apparition. After something like a burial, of weeks in duration, Nestoria came forth, unveiled and pallid, to meet her fellow mortals. At sight of her Lehming and Bowlder rose to their feet and bowed, with some such feeling as if they were saluting an infant who did not belong to this worldâan infant who had already become a seraph. She was quite small, it will be remembered, and the stress of grinding trouble and auxiety had worn her thin, so that she looked even more tiny and childlike than her wont. Her bright natural color had faded under the shadows of sorrow and confinement; and the terror of discovery which crisped her heart at this moment gave her a whiteness like marble. In contrast to this pallor her lucid blue eyes were startling, and her luxuriant golden hair seemed twisted of living sunlight. As for her expression, it was simply wonderful and indescribable. There could not easily be a more touching sadness, a more plaintive demand for sympathy, on the human countenance. In spite of struggles for resignation, in spite of a present effort to put on a mask of unconcern, and perhaps all the more because of the pinching constraint of that effort, she had a look which rivalled the calm despair of the Cenci. To Lehming and Bowlder, both sensitive and sincerely compassionate spirits, she appeared to advance under a cross and wearing a crown of thorns. Even Miss Jones was impressed by this spectacle of timidity and suffering. For a few seconds she gazed at it in silence, forgetful of her mouthing elocution and fustian rhetoric, and honestly fearful lest the girl should faint away. But she had a difficult duty to perform: it was nothing less than to present in fitting terms a young lady whose full name she did not know; and, making one of those efforts under which both feelings and circumstances must bend, she addressed herself to the unparalleled ceremony. With a prompt ingenuity for which she ever after admired herself, she called to mind the spot where she had first met her mysterious fellow-lodger, and evolved therefrom a patronymic for her. âMiss Nettie Fulton,â she bowed in her greatest manner. âNettie, my dear, let me introduce you to my old friend, Mr. Lehming, and my new friend, Mr. Bowlder.â For an instant she could say no more. The highest triumphs of genius are not gained without an exhaustive struggle. Once more we behold Miss Jones beaten by herself, and reduced to an agreeable silence. There was such a din of shy, timorous blood in Nestoria's ears that she did not notice the new name which had been given her, and so was not discomposed by it. She heard only a jumble of words which she knew to be a form of introduction, and in obedience to it she bowed mechanically, but without speaking. She was in a strange confusion of spirit. So powerfully had her late seclusion impressed her, that it seemed to her as if she were now for the first time entering human society. Moreover, there was the terrible possibility that these men might guess her identity and surrender her to justice. Nevertheless, she could not help seeking their companionship, as a shipwrecked pirate might draw toward navigators who should land upon his islet, though fearful that they had come for his capture and punishment. Lehming and Bowlder were also unusually bewildered. They were dazzled by the girl's beauty, and touched by her plaintive expression of sorrow, and attracted by her air of infantile helplessness. They had a longing to gather her into protecting and comforting arms, as one picks up and pets an unknown child who has fallen into trouble. Thus for a few seconds there was silence, all three gazing at Nestoria. This dumb inspection frightened the girl: of a sudden it seemed to her that these men had seen her before; and she quivered with a mad impulse to rush back into her room and lock the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXX. FINE TALK AND UGLY NEWS. Nestoria was saved from a flight which might have led Lehming, and even the transcendentally unpractical Bowlder, to suspect something strange in her history. Miss Jones saved her; not that she meant salvation; not that she perceived the advent of a crisis which required interference; on the contrary, she was thinking solely of herself, what she must do and how she must appear; her soul, as was too often the case with it, was intent upon her own aggrandizement in the eyes of her fellow creatures. âHave the kindness to be seated, Nettie, and you also, gentlemen,â she said, waving her hand majestically toward chairs, and talking with her front teeth, as we must do when we wish to inspire respect. âI regret, for your sakes, that my accommodations are not more palatial. But such as I have that I give, and most freely.â âMonarchs could demand no more,â answered John Bowlder, who had by this time recovered from his trance, and saw an opening for philosophy. âA true monarch, a natural kingly soul, would desire no more. The angels who visited Abraham found no fault with his tent. Damask curtains and velvet sofas are merely adventitious circumstances, which may or may not attend hospitality. We think too lowly of our impulses and too highly of our material surroundings. Man is the oak and wealth the vine; and it is well if the vine do not strangle the oak; it is well if we cultivate the tree rather than the parasite. And when I say man, Miss Jones, I mean woman as well.â This sort of talk was rather deep water for Imogen Eleonore. She was at home in the spasmodic tempests of romance, but her first glimpse of the obscure ocean of transcendentalism daunted her. Her vanity and pluck, however, rebelled against the idea of being silenced. As the reader may already have suspected, she prided herself on being what she called a âconversationist,â and held it a shame to let dumbness prevail in her society. She was always looking for opportunities to shine, and, although her shining was as the shining of a monkey who has daubed himself with molasses, being rather ludierous and inconvenient than illuminating, nevertheless she was not in the least aware of this discouraging fact, and so did her best to scintillate on all occasions. âAlas, how little we understand the opacities of life!â she said with a tragic stare, which ought to have let daylight through an opaque world. âHow much we are captivated by the palatial brown-stone fronts, nor divine the meanness of the ignoble souls which they shelter, and which perchance are more miserable on Turkish carpets than they would be on sanded floors!â Like many people of small means, who would dearly love to wallow in luxury, Miss Jones was much given to imputing unrighteousness to the rich, and trusting that they have at bottom a hard time of it. âThe finest linen, the soft frills of lace embroidery, and the costliest Majolica needlework, are often naught but veils for vice and misery,â she went on cheerfully and magnanimously. âAs you observe, Mr. Bowlder, we must not prize surroundings nor judge people by them. Often and often, as I have passed unnoticed and unknown, garmented only in my proud poverty and isolation, before the abodes of uptown magnificence, I have said to myself, Is joy here? No, surely not, was the drear response; at least not necessarily. What do you think, Mr. Lehming?â âDon't let us be too hard on the rich,â smiled the kindly pygmy. âThey are unfortunate in their circumstances, it is true. But, as you were saying just now, ought we to blame people for their surroundings? Let us judge the men themselves. Considering how little harm the wealthy really do, when they have the power to do so much, I am disposed to pardon them their shortcomings, and even to grant them some admiration.â âCertainly,â bowed Imogen Eleonore, disposed to assent to these opinions because they had been imputed to her. âAnd now let us make a little journey,â continued Lehming, rising. âI want to show you something which I think will give you a pleasure. Miss Nettie,â he added, turning to Nestoria, and addressing her as he would have addressed a child, so youthful was her appearanceââMiss Nettie, will you walk with me? You and I are so nearly of a size that we shall not overshadow each other. We will let those two loftier people follow us. The brownies and fairies preceded the human beings in the procession of existence. Poor little extinct fairies and brownies! You and I are almost the last of those races.â They marched two and two through the passage to the door of Lehming's study. âEnter my palace,â he said. âThis is my hall of glamour and enchantment. Here are treasures of gladness, my dear Miss Jones, which brown-stone palaces cannot surpass. This is our common reading-room, and the reading-room of all in this house. You two ladies must come here whenever you wish, and carry away whatever you like. A daily paper and two literary weeklies and half a dozen magazines and four hundred books will keep us all in luxury.â âOh, I am so grateful to you, sir!â exclaimed Nestoria. Her pale cheeks flushed with pleasure, and the flushing caused a sudden, surprising increase in her beauty, not unlike what we see in the light of certain stars, which one moment are dim and the next luminous. âYou are fond of reading,â said Lehming, delighted with her satisfaction. âVery,â replied the girl, her eyes wandering greedily along the book-shelves. âYou surprise me, Nettie,â observed Miss Jones. âYou hardly ever look at the stacks and stacks of literature in my room.â âThe `Spasmodic' and the `Turtle Dove!' â smiled Lehming. âI decline to blame her. My dear Miss Jones, there are better things than the `Spasmodie' and the `Turtle Dove,' and it is time that we give our attention to them.â âI thought you approved of fiction,â stammered Imogen Eleonore, a sensitive plant by reason of much vanity, and disposed to accept exhortation as reproof. âHere are Dickens and Hawthorne and Trollope and Charles Reade,â continued Lehming. âThey tell better stories than you will find in our New York weeklies.â âI have read `Foul Play,' â said Miss Jones, glancing at the title of that work. âIt was in a ten-cent pamphlet, the same as a `Dime Novel.' That is by Charles Reade, I see. Did he ever write anything else?â Even Lehming, accustomed as he was to the humbler society of New York, marvelled at such amazing ignorance in a veteran devourer of romance. Here was a young woman who read almost nothing but novels, and who yet scarcely knew the name of Charles Reade, while Hawthorne and Trollope were evidently as strange to her as Berosus and Sanchoniathon. To a person of refined taste the lack of literary culture among the great mass, the overwhelming majority, of the so-called reading public is all but incredible. The million, or perhaps one might truthfully say the millions, who find their sentimental recreation in such papers as the sanguinary âSpasmodicâ or the amatory âTurtle Dove,â are as unaware of the real masters of dramatic and literary art as they are of the celebrities of metaphysics or philology. They do not know their works at all, and if they knew them they would not like them. A sensational weekly which should attempt to entertain its subscribers with the novels of Hawthorne or George Eliot, would probably come to an early decease. The true secret of gaining the favor of this immensely numerous class of readers is to furnish them with matter just a little better than they could write themselves. âYou may trust Reade,â said Lehming, who was anxious to raise Miss Jones's standard of taste. âHe will always give you a well-ordered plot and an interesting sequence of incidents. Some of his characters, too, are sketched vigorously, and have the broad traits of human nature recognizable everywhere. I should think a Chinaman might be interested in Reade. Try him by all means; then we will go higher.â Imogen Eleonore, meanwhile, was reconnoitring the pages of âGriffith Gauntâ with a questioning and skittish eye, ready to start back if she should discover anything grave or tedious. âHere is what seems to speak to my soul,â she at last said, though with some hesitation, as though the speech were indistinct or the soul hard of hearing. âThere is a tremulous strain of woe in this tale which I think will suit me,â she added, putting the book under her arm, and turning to the more alluring matter of a pictorial weekly. Meantime Nestoria had taken a small, plain volume from the shelves, and had plunged her face into it with the eager air of one violently athirst, who satiates himself from a fountain. âMay I ask what you have there, Miss Nettie?â inquired Lehming, approaching her in his gentle, gliding, nurselike way. She held up that eloquent confession of a devout soul, written in the simplest, purest, most idiomatic Englishâa book which great literary ability could not imitate either in feeling or styleâJohn Bunyan's âGrace Abounding.â âIt is a masterpiece,â he said reverently, after glancing at her with surprise. âIt equals Herodotus in childlike grace, and it surpasses him in sublimity and pathos. There are passages in it which have made me turn to the epistles of Paul, to see which is the greater saint and the greater writer. Will you allow me to give it to you?â âI thank you,â replied the girl, while a flush of gratitude colored her entire face, there was such abundance and fervor in it. âShe feels the need of abounding grace and mercy,â thought Lehming to himself. âI am in the solemn and awful presence of a profoundly troubled soul.â They looked at each other in serious silence, regardless of John Bowlder and Imogen Eleonore, who were holding some nondescript babble at the other end of the room. âYou are more kind than I know how to tell you,â continued Nestoria. âIf I could tell you how much your kindness touches me, you would be astonished.â âMy dear child, you alarm me,â sighed Lehming. âI fear that I am not so worthy and wise a friend as you need.â Nestoria was on the point of answering, âYou are no doubt far better than I deserve;â but she did not dare come so near to a confession of her haunting horror; she remained silent. âHave you no relatives, no intimates?â Lehming presently inquired. âI am quite alone,â she responded, after a moment of natural hesitation. âCould you trust me to find you some acquaintances, such as I should judge suitable?â She shook her head. âNo, no. I have no time for society. I must work all the while. It will be all I need if I see you and your cheerful, pleasant friend. I like him, he has such kind eyes.â âIt shall be as you wish,â bowed Lehming. âYou shall see us every day, and no one else. I trust that you will come to this room freely and make use of everything in it precisely as if it were your own.â âI thank you,â said Nestoria. âI will come now and thenâperhaps every day.â And with this understanding the interview ended, the two young women returning to their own rooms. âThose men seem very, very good,â observed Nestoria to Imogen, when they were alone. âI don't believe that either of them could commit a crime.â âWhat straânge speeches you do make!â stared Miss Jones, absolutely envious of an eccentricity of thought or sentiment which she felt herself incapable of rivalling. âWho that one really knows, who of all the feeble beings that one is daily obliged to herd with, is capable of the sublimity of crime? If I knew a man who dared be a wretch,â she continued, rolling mock-heroic eyes, âI could worâship him. Grandeur of soul, whether for good or evil, is what I seek through the feebleâoh how feeble!âinanities of commonplace life.â One is tempted to make a long pause over the contrast presented by these two young women; the one forever strutting in simulated gloom and real satisfaction through some sham tragedy of the fancy; the other speechless and almost crushed under that pantherish thing which a real romance almost always is. But there is no need of philosophizing; the situation is visible at the first glance. âYou must not speak in that way,â replied Nestoria quietly, though with an inward shudder. âGod may some day take you at your word and grant your desire. You would be very wretched.â Secretly awed by the solemnity of this warning, Imogen Eleonore gave one stare at her unfathomable companion, and then turned for cheering diversion to the evening newspaper. As usual she read first the marriages and then the obituaries. âNobody is dead that I know,â she sighed. âAnd only one person who seems to be of any note. The paper calls him the celebrated missionary, Doctor Bernard. Died at Erzeroum, August 5th. What a dolefully dull sheet! Do you want to look at it?â Nestoria mechanically took the journal, rose from her chair with a great effort, walked unsteadily into her own room, and closed the door behind her. âWhat a queer piece!â thought Miss Jones. âShe has such starts and ways that sometimes she puts me out of all patience. Let her go and freak it out alone.â But half an hour later she thought she heard sobbing in Nestoria's room, and, forgetting her petulance, she went to see about it. The orphaned girl lay on her bed, tossing and twitching spasmodically, her eyes dry and feverish and her face flushed. âYou are ill, Nettie,â said Imogen. âWhy didn't you call me? I must go and get a doctor.â âNo, no!â gasped Nestoria, starting up on her elbow and putting out one hand in earnest protest. âBut you need one,â urged Miss Jones. âI am afraid you are going to be real sick.â âOh, let me be sick!â pleaded Nestoria, tired of life and longing to die. âI beg of you not to call any one.â Daunted by such despair, and overcome by its imperious tone of urgency, Imogen Eleonore sat down. But an hour later she slyly slipped out, hurried to the reading-room, found Lehming there writing, and whispered, âMy little friend is dreadfully ill.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXI. WHITHER, O WHITHER? âAnd she won't have a doctor!â continued Imogen Eleonore with mingled pity and horror, as if here were a piece of either madness or blasphemy. The sympathetic Lehming sprang to his feet, ready to scour the entire city for help. But he was not one of those headlong good souls who trample blindly into a case of distress and save looking-glasses by pitching them out of a window. Even while he threw down his pen and rose from his table he had a gleam of that meditative, considerate wisdom which was one of his finest intellectual traits, and which frequently enabled him to make his deeds as gracious as his purposes. Little as he had consorted with women in society, he had noted the impulsive promptness with which they turn in trouble to a healer or consoler, whether in the guise of physician, or clergyman, or confidant. The fact that this girl should in her illness refuse to see a doctor struck him as very singular and very significant. Either she was a person of rare courage, or she was in strange circumstances. âWe will not call any one, unless it proves necessary,â he said. âPerhaps this is only a sickness of the mind,â he added, remembering the plaintive mystery which he had detected in Nestoria's face and demeanor. âWill you please ask if I may come in with you and see her for just one moment?â Imogen Eleonore hurried away much comforted; she had laid her burden of responsibility and alarm on the shoulders of another; and, like most of her sex, or, perhaps I should say, like most of both sexes, she found the act cheering. But she did not return for many minutes, and Lehming said to himself, âI shall not be received.â So it proved. Nestoria would see no one, neither physician nor confessor. She bore this new and terrible affliction as she had borne all those other terrible ones which preceded itâalone. And she did really bear it; that is, she did not sink under it. Already she was like an otter, or other hunted beast, torn at by many hounds; one more snarling and mangling enemy made no difference, or seemed to make none. Indeed, the multitude of tormentors rather helped her to endure the suffering which each one inflicted; they crowded each other away from their victim, and the poison of one bite neutralized that of another. It is marvellous, but it is nevertheless a fact, that brave souls can withstand a host of afflictions almost as easily as one. It is brooding over a single calamity which brings on prostration and stupor, and which kills. Many blows at once, falling from all sides, keep the mind in activity. We are roused by a sense of injustice; we are exhilarated as by a physical conflict; and from the passion of battle we gather life. It is true that most persons might have been crushed by what Nestoria endured at this time. But she had a vigor of constitution, both physical and moral, which kept her out of sickness and out of despair. There could hardly be a more healthy creature than this small and seemingly delicate young woman. And health, the mere well-being of the body, is the spring of almost all human strength. With few exceptions the men who have done great things in this world have been distinguished by enormous vitality, while many of them have been remarkable for muscular power. Plato was a boxer; Byron was an athlete and could swim eight miles; Washington, Scott, and Wordsworth had muscles of iron; Lincoln could lift a thousand pounds. We do not mean to insinuate that Nestoria was intellectually great like these men, but only that she had somewhat of their moral vigor, and that it sprang from the same cause, health. We must pass over a day or two in the girl's history. It is impossible to describe adequately the sufferings of a bereaved soul while its loss is fresh upon it; you might as well try to paint in mere words the agonies of victims in Dominican chambers of torture. Show the rack and the thumbscrews and the lacerating knives of the deadly âvirgin,â and leave the conception of what these things can inflict to the imagination of the spectator. A day passed like a car of Juggernant over Nestoria; a day which to her fellow lodgers seemed sickness, but which was merely anguish; a drama in which the mightiest and cruellest feelings that can find room in the human heart were the actors; a battle worthy of having angels and demons for combatants, if indeed such were not actually present. At the end of that twenty-four hours she still retained life, reason, and even physical strength. She came out upon her little world of three persons, much the same that they had previously known her. Imogen Eleonore, returning from a hasty twilight shopping excursion, peeped into the sick-room to see how her patient fared, and found her painting. âI am so glad you have got well!â she exclaimed, moved by such honest feeling that she spoke simply. âI have not been sick,â replied Nestoria, looking up with the patient smile of one who has truly learned to endure. âNot been sick!â stared Miss Jones. âWhy, you've been looking dreadfullyâjust like a ghost.â âYes, I have had a bad day, it is true. What I meant was that I have had no serious illness. I am not accustomed to call myself sick so long as I can get up when I wish to.â âWell, you are a strange piece!â continued Imogen, still marvelling at this sudden recovery, which struck her as something like a resuscitation. âI wonder if you are made like other people. Do let me feel of you. Why, your check is as hard as marble. I never felt such solid flesh. How strong you must be! Are you as hard as that all over?â âMy father has often remarked how firm my flesh was,â replied Nestoria. She stopped; she had inadvertently mentioned her father; at times his death semed unreal to her. But the moment she recalled the fact, speech on any subject became an impossibility, at least for a time. âHave you a father?â asked Imogen Eleonore, in that melodramatic voice which she put on as a garment whenever she made her entry upon what seemed to her a great subject. Nestoria shook her head and tried to go on painting; but the blundering shock of this inquiry was too much for her; she dropped her brush, covered her face with her hands, and burst into tears. They were the first tears which she had shed upon her bereavement, and they came rather as a rain of mercy than as a storm of castigation. âLong dead?â queried Miss Jones, trusting that curiosity might seem to be sympathy, and indeed conscious of a cordial sympathy beneath an equally fervid curiosity. But Nestoria, deafened by the tempest of her own sobbing, was spared from hearing the loutish question. Imogen Eleonore, who, in spite of her relish for ghoulish literature, was really a human being, presently became ashamed of herself and then pitiful. She was not accustomed to witness strong emotions, except through the dingy veil of letter-press and woodcuts; and she recoiled from this violent paroxysm of grief as she would have flinched from the actual presence of wounds and blood. âI am awfully sorry!â she apologized. âI was not aware of the plaintive abyss of the unknown from which my careless foot extorted this cry of soul agony. It was not that my heart was lacking in the tendrils of tenderness, but only that I have had no such sad, sorrowful, solemn experience. I never lost a payrent.â To this simple and egotistic girl it seemed as if no grief could resist such soothing, or fail to be charmed by such excuses. But the soul before her was in truly deep waters; and, dim as Imogen's spiritual eyesight was, she presently became troublously aware of the fact; she seemed to discern a spirit tottering and sinking amid raging, obscure billows. Nestoria's spasm of sobbing was so fierce and persistent that it fairly terrified the inadequate comforter. âFor pity's sake don't cry that way,â she implored. âYou'll strain yourself and burst a blood-vessel. Why, your face is all crimson. Oh, don't be so unhappy! You make me cry, and scare me.â Slender as was this stream of consolation, and turbid too with the common clay of the nature which yielded it, nevertheless it had force and subtlety enough to reach the bereaved heart. It was received there with gratitude: extreme anguish is not exacting nor fastidious: Dives in his torments asked for but a single drop of water. Nestoria withdrew one hand from her face, let it glide slowly down Imogen's extended arm, and took an infantile hold on the skirt of her dress. The gesture, as we remember, was characteristic of her; it was her favorite manner of claiming sympathy and support. Imogen thought very strange of it, and said to herself that this was surely the oddest girl that she had ever met; but within the last minute or so she had caught a grace of delicacy which enabled her to resist all blundering temptations to speech; the one wise, gentle thing which she did was to lay her hand upon the tremulous hand which clung to her. The two girls sat thus, fingers intertwined with fingers, while the tempest of sobs slowly died away, like waves lapsing to rest. âIt is over,â said Nestoria at last, forcing such a plaintive smile as a resigned ghost might wear on returning to its grave. âHow patient and kind you are! I shall always love you.â It was the last violent throe of grief which Imogen ever witnessed in her friend. Henceforward Nestoria was able to draw a veil of obscuring tranquallity over her filial sorrow, as well as over her perplexities and terrors. Secrecy at every point was an absolute necessity; she must not even mourn visibly and audibly for her father. If ever the tears came into her eyes at the thought of his burial afar off in a spot unknown to her, she drove the piteous, pleading drops back to their lair, as enemies who might betray and ruin her. If a sob burst up from her deserted heart, she made cruel haste to smother it before some accusing voice should respond, âAre you not she whom justice seeks?â Hardly dared she go deeply veiled to purchase such religious periodicals as she supposed might contain notices of her father's life and the manner of his death; and when she had obtained them, she read them in watchful solitude and then hid them under her mattress, as if they were proofs of crime. The four or five obituaries and eulogies which came to her hand were of course infinitely precious to her; and she longed to cut them out and keep them always near her heart and ready for her eye. But that would not do, for, if they were discovered in her possession, they might suggest her identity. Her grief was held in check by her constant dread of discovery and of the results which discovery would surely bring in its train. She was like a child shut up in a dark room, who dares not sob for fear of being overheard by some monster. Meantime what should she do? The angel of death had changed the face of the world to her; he had swept clean out of life her only imaginable refuge. Her situation was that of a wanderer in deserts who hears that the oasis towards which he was faintly struggling has been overwhelmed by sandstorms, its sheltering palms uprooted and its wells choked. During weeks, which flowed with the scorching slowness of melted lead. Nestoria had been supported by the hope of reaching her father, and casting at his feet that horrible secret, so like to a mangled and blood-dripping corpse which a demoniacal destiny had fastened upon her. Now there was no one in all the earth to relieve her of her grisly load; she must bear it alone until she should be able to lay it beside her in her grave. There were times when the whole of this wearying pilgrimage seemed to open before her, the vastness of the inhospitable outlook drinking up all her strength and courage, as the Sahara absorbs a rivulet at the beginning of its course. But she must not faint; she must struggle to shape her future so that it should be bearable; especially must she discover and attain to some place of hiding. With a travail of spirit which was so immense and various that we may speak of it as her labors of Hercules, she ransacked the whole world for an asylum. Where was the spot which could give security to a friendless girl, whose terrible treasure, eagerly sought for by whole communities, was the secret of a murder? Little by little she settled upon the resolution that as soon as she had money enough for the voyage, she would fly to some barbarous island of the Pacific ocean, there to end in obscurity her outcast life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXII. A SAD FAIRY AND A COMFORTING BROWNIE. This thought of a flight to the unknown and almost unimaginable coral solitudes of the Pacific took a strong hold on Nestoria's imagination. It helped her bear onward her heavy days, and at night it sometimes lulled her to sleep. As she bent over her painting she had reveries of floating over long, smooth billows, under the white, tranquil wings of sailing seabirds, toward inlets alive with canoes and shores waving with palms. The same pictures came to her in dreams; she was among wild peoples, but free from perplexities and terrors; she lived the life of a savage, but she was at peace. So happy was she in these visions that more than once she shed a few tears on awaking. As is often the case with the quietly wretched, the sorrowful who see no immediate escape in effort, she slept much. In sleep she forgot her alarms, griefs, remorse; in sleep there was a temporary truce to her warfare; she could lay down her arms when she lost her senses. We see a spirit which, though able to bear much, felt great weariness. Her reveries, and the eagerness with which she hailed them, proved how enfeebled was her mind, or rather how tired. The soul which is faint with hard and long rowing, lands willingly on this Lotos island of revery. Much, however, as the girl's thoughts partook of the nature of day-dreams, she was serious in her purpose of seeking refuge in the Pacific. She really meant to get to the Marquesas, or some other more unfrequented archipelago, and bury all her future years in its rank savagery. Perhaps she would be a missionary; perhaps spend her life in proclaiming the true God to heathens; it would be a fitting work for one who had been such a criminal; it would be a Pauline repentance. For she still believed that she acted very wickedly in refusing to expose the guilt of Edward Wetherel, and longed to do some worthy work and bear some self-inflicted penalty, which might make partial amends for her sin, even though justification and forgiveness were unattainable. Yes, a missionary life in the Pacific, suffering enormous hardships, incurring daily peril of death, and perhaps putting on the crown of martyrdom, was the career toward which she must strive. But before she could take flight she must have wings; and she labored incessantly to fabricate them, adding dollar to dollar. Meantime she could not dispense entirely with human fellowship. A troubled woman instinctively looks for help to a man; and now that Nettie no longer saw her father walking the stormy sea of life, she felt a need of some other virile saviour; before she was well aware of it she was stretching out the arms of her soul toward Lehming. It was very natural. There was as it were an aureole of sweetness and lightâthe sweetness of rich sympathy and the light of a clear intelligenceâaround the misshapen head of this good pygmy, easily visible to eyes seeking a deliverer. She had sagacity enough to feel (rather than to formally argue out) his superiority in real moral muscle over John Bowlder, burly as this last might seem to a superficial glance. Every day she sought more and more the society of Lehming, and found more support and pleasure in it. As for him, he was eager to give her all the aid and counsel and pity that she would ask for, or could be brought to accept. No other human being, not even Edward Wetherel, under the blight of an imputed crime, had ever interested him so deeply as did this lonely, patient-eyed girl. When a man's heart is naturally sweet, every intellectual force that he possesses tends to increase its sweetness. Lehming was all the more benevolent because he had a strong imagination and unusual powers of reflection. It seemed to him that he had found a soul shipwrecked on the reefs of some unknown sorrow, and he longed incessantly to nurse it to health and give it deliverance. He was too delicate to intrude into Nettie's mystery by questions; but he accorded to her such watching and attentions as affection grants to an invalid. There was an inexhaustible willingness to listen to her in the rare hours when she chose to talk; there was a copious outpouring of instruction and amusement from his stores of knowledge; there were daily offerings of flowers and fruit. He knew the preciousness of little marks of regard, because he had rarely received them and had suffered from the lack of them. His demeanor toward her had somewhat of the subtle perfume of courtship. He was far indeed from meaning it as such, for he had not the slightest hope of winning the girl's heart, and desired only to give forth his own wealth of emotion. Never forgetting his deformity of body and feature, and altogether unconscious of his attractive beauty of soul, he was humility itself. The idea of wooing and winning a handsome young woman would have seemed to him nothing better than frenzy. Nevertheless, as time went on, he swung insensibly nearer to this frenzy, approaching it by unconscious circlings, as a boat nears the Maelstrom. There was to come a period in his life when he would like a woman precisely as other men like women. He was destined to fall in love with Nestoria, and toward that fate he was even now drifting. Not a day passed without a meeting between them. As we have said, the door of Lehming's library was always open to all the inhabitants of the tenement-house. But the lodgers in the lower floors did not care to enter it; they were of that hurried class who write upon the doors of their offices, âGone to dinnerâback in ten minutesâ; they were so dragged about by the almighty dollar that they had no time or no taste for reading. Nestoria soon discovered that she was not liable to meet any one in the library besides its owner and John Bowlder and Imogen Eleonore; and thus she fell into a habit of visiting it every evening, when darkness forbade her to walk and her hand was cramped with painting. Lehming was almost always there, sometimes absorbed in a book, but more often writing. There was an exchange of smiles âtwo of the sweetest and most pathetic smiles ever seen; then Nestoria selected her volume or magazine, and seated herself by the long centre-table; after that there might be half an hour without a sound except the turning of leaves or the scratching of a pen. The very silence of Lehming was an aroma from his exquisite delicacy. He feared that if he talked much to his guest he would have an air of demanding amusement from her, and so render his hospitality less free. Moreover, he found it necessary to resist the first encroachments of a compassionate curiosity which perpetually tempted him to put such questions to her concerning her history as she might perhaps not desire to answer. Consequently he laid down for himself the rule that he must never put aside his pen until she had first put aside her book. Is it not touching and indeed downright piteous to find such considerateness and self-control in one at whose feet life had laid so few favors and pleasures? But it is in just such humble vessels that we might expect to discover these rare graces. We must stoop to figures weighed down by crosses, and look under the acute shadows of crowns of thorns, if we would behold the brows which wear the brightest halos. Sometimes, however, there were long communings between these two children of sorrow. Their talk frequently concerned literature, for Lehming was a contributor to various periodicals, and furthermore he had the project of a book on his mind, and he loved to discuss the art in which he was a student. One of these dialogues we may find it worth while to listen to, because, although it began upon the most commonplace circumstances of a life of authorship, it eventually wound and crept on until it touched the borders of Nestoria's woful secret. âIs making stories very profitable?â inquired the girl, wondering whether she could write and thus earn money wherewith to fly to undiscoverable islands. âIt brings in something,â replied Lehming, entering eagerly upon a subject which profoundly interested him. âIn the monthlies, weeklies, and dailies there is a fair market for tales and articles. A magazinist with talent, who works hard and gives all his time to his work, can average twelve or perhaps fifteen hundred dollars a year. In other words, he can earn something more than a common carpenter, and a good deal less than an expert machinist. But when you have made that modest statement, you have summed up nearly the whole of a writer's chance for income. The profit on a book, speaking in a general way, would not support an infant. People say that the periodical has killed the volume; but while this is true in a measure, it is not all the trouble; it is mainly the foreign reprint which kills the American work. Are you aware that any one of our publishers can seize upon any European book without paying the author a penny? Such is the dishonest fact; now look at the discouraging result. The American volume (let us suppose it is Lehming's) is necessarily loaded with a royalty payable to the writer; this royalty is only the pittance of ten per cent. in most cases, but it raises the price of the work by that amount; if without it the price would be ninety cents, for instance, it must now be sold at a dollar. Well, what sort of competition is this dollar book exposed to? The competition of Dickens, Reade, Thackeray, and all the athletes of foreign literatureâall selling ten per cent. cheaper. Ten per cent.? I should come nearer the mark in saying twenty-five per cent., fifty per cent. Our publisher only selects for reprints the best of European works, such as have already succeeded in their own countryâsuch as are sure to succeed here. He is so certain of purchasers that he can afford to be cheap, and also to advertise liberally. He is so certain of competition if he demands a high price, that he must be cheap. You will find Dickens and Reade and many others on our book counters at fifty and thirty cents a volume. Now, what does the purchaser do? Do you imagine that he will buy Lehming at a dollar when he can get Lehming's master at half a dollar? He makes the bargain that will give him the most for his money, and in so doing he helps to kill American literature. It is the only business in our country in which the producer is completely sacrificed to the consumer. The result is that we have no literature; we have only a dozen or so of professed authors; and that dozen write mainly for the monthlies and weeklies. The American book is growing rarer year by year, and will soon be as extinct as the dodo. Men will not continue a labor which brings them only neglect and starvation.â âBut a few write,â said Nestoria. âYou write.â âA few will always write,â answered Lehming. âEvery year five or six tyros step forward and awkwardly renew a useless struggle. But the circumstances of the case are inexorable; they wear out the most hopeful and the ablest spirits. We shall never have practised and skilful authors until we establish such an international copyright as will enable the native work to enter the market on equal terms with the foreign reprint. This competition of theft, moreover, is not the only trouble. Literature in our country is shackled with imposts and with customs duties. Paper, types, type metal, the materials for binding, everything which goes to the making of a book, bears a load of taxation for the benefit of some manufacturer. Our publishers themselves are so burdened that they are unable to hold our own market, and are steadily becoming mere distributors for English publications. It seems as if our legislators had sworn that, whatever else they left undone, they would root out American literature.â âI don't fully understand, but it seems very discouraging,â sighed Nestoria. âI was wondering whether I could write; but I will make you a present of my subject.â Then, after a moment of pondering, she went on hastily, as if impelled to speak, âI had a strange idea in my mind. It was that a girl should like some one, and like him very, very much, only to find that he was utterly wicked. Then what? Should she merely abandon him? Or should she denounce him to punishment? I don't know. I can't see how it should end.â âShe should both abandon and denounce him,â answered Lehming with the facile promptness of poetical justice. Nestoria recoiled from him a little, pressed her hands together, and turned slightly pale. âStop,â added the young man meditatively. âYou have proposed a difficult problem. We must not judge even fictitious personages with haste and indifference. If we do not owe a duty to their shadowy existences, we owe one to our own mental and moral nature. I must have time to consider your riddle.â Nothing more was said on the subject; indeed, Nestoria was frightened at having said so much; but Lehming brooded over her suggestion frequently. Of course he asked himself whether the girl had alluded to the sorrow which looked out of her plaintive eyes; and of course the query, although unanswerable, made her all the more attractive to his sensitive and compassionate spirit. Other conversations, and other vague, timid hints of suffering, quickened his sympathy. Even if there were no mystery of great trouble in this child's life, he felt certain that she was lonely and almost friendless, and he longed to surround her with consolation. Not yet, not even in the rare vagaries which he permitted to his imagination, did he purpose to offer her a heart in place of the one which, as he sometimes suspected, she had found corrupt and cast away with noble loathing. He was too meek to believe that his affection could be worthy of complete acceptance, even at hands which pleaded for affection as a charity; and to ask any woman whatever to receive him as a husband would, it seemed to him, be altogether unnatural and monstrous, and shamefully absurd. But he was slipping toward Nestoria; he was becoming every day less and less the ruler of his thoughts and feelings; there was no telling how his moth-like circlings might end. Eyes which in this matter were keener than his, though duller by far in almost all things else, watched him with a petulant disapproval, judging him to be very near the flame of love. âIt will be real shabby if Mr. Lehming tries to marry that poor little chit,â said Imogen Eleonore to herself more than once. âMr. Lehming ought to know that he isn't a proper person to have a pretty girl. He may be very good and have a first-rate education, but he's a little jolter-headed hunchback, and not a fit match at all for my Nettie. If he wasn't a prominent instructor, I'd give him a piece of my mind about it.â Miss Jones, we perceive, put the matter in order before her mind in plain, straightforward terms, not encumbering it with the retinue of bombastic phrases which she favored when in society. We may infer that she really and honestly feared lest the incongruous wooing of which she discoursed might come about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIII. REMINISCENCES AND SUSPICIONS. BIG, burly, and boisterous John Bowlder was scarcely less bewitched about Nestoria than the little and gentle Lehming. This transcendent soul, this comet of the subjective universe, actually became somewhat realistic and business-like in his desire to befriend the lonely child. Divining by a prodigious effort of âinsightâ that she needed money as well as sympathy, he used up what he picturesquely called âthe slack of his incomeâ in buying her fans as presents for his other pets; the said other pets, by the way, being not young ladies, but little ragged girls who went to Lehming's Sunday-school, and who had no spare funds to expend on gewgaws: âhumble butterflies,â as the philosopher phrased it, âwho need some glorifying to fit them for life's sunshine.â When Bowlder could no longer purchase, he appointed himself the artist's drummer or commercial traveller, and hawked her delicate merchandise from shop to shop with a pride which ennobled peddling. Such an outlandish pilgrim has seldom been seen in the marts of our American Vanity Fair. The shopmen of Broadway and Canal street were dumbfounded by his other-world countenance, manners, and dialect. âFans, my worthy friend, fans!â he would say, patting a dealer condescendingly on the shoulder. âLook at them! Not merely instruments to stir the lazy wind and cool the languid brow, but visions to steal through the windows of the eye and transport the longing soul. In judging the market value of such a thing, you must look beneath the use and penetrate to the grace. Beauty has an aureole which decorates related objects. See here,â spreading a fan, and fluttering it about his great rosy face and bushy, grizzly beard, âI am a finer creature than I was a moment ago. This little painting of birds and flowers lends me somewhat of its own Ã¦sthetic nature. I am a handsomer man because I have a handsome fan. There is loveliness, purchasable at twenty dimes! What woman who should come to your counter could resist such a bargain? With glory like that to sell, people will not only buy of you, but go away feeling enriched, and so return to buy again. Take them, my human friend take the lot and prosper. You can have the six infinite wonders for nine poor, finite dollars.â The bargain consummated, he would eagerly butt his way homeward through the crowded streets, rush into Nestoria's presence with such vehemence as to make little breezes all around him, toss the results of his peddling into her lap, and wave his big red hand in deprecation of thanks. Thus these three persons met and communed daily with tranquil countenances, when recognition would have made them stare at each other like startled ghosts. Bowlder and Lehming, both anxious to discover Nestoria Bernard and to unveil the Wetherel mystery, helped her in earning means to fly with it to the ends of the earth. It may seem incredible that they should be her companions for weeks without causing her to suspect their intimate acquaintance with the tragedy which had driven her into hiding. But they were strange men, living mainly in a condition of isolation, and little addicted to the gossip which forms so large a part of ordinary human converse. âRelatives are less to me than my own shadow,â John Bowlder was accustomed to boast, with some exaggeration. âMy shadow is in a measure the image of myself; but my cousin or brother may be discordant or antagonistic. My true blood-connections are the people who share my thoughts and heart-beats, though they abide at the antipodes and catch rats and puppies for pies. Buddha is perhaps my father, and Confucius my uncle, and Ah Sin my brother.â Acting in accordance with these whimwhams, as far as his really strong natural affections would let him, the ideological Bowlder prided himself on treating the every-day, essential affairs of his life with sovereign contempt, eschewing discourse concerning the people whom he knew and the things which he did, and talking mainly of matters that he was not acquainted with. Up to a certain point Lehming was very like him in this peculiarity of impersonal conversation. Their speech with each other was usually subjective, rather than objective. The one brimmed over with literature, and the other spurted hogsheads of philosophy, but neither gave out much chitchat. Thus it happened that they never mentioned in Nestoria's presence the names of Dinneford and Wetherel. The murder they were the less likely to speak of, because it had already taken on the character of a mystery, fatiguingly incomprehensible even to policemen. Edward Wetherel, too, we may as well state here, was the less present to their minds for the reason that he was absent in body. In search of some reported trace of bloodstained feet, flying from the scene of his uncle's assassination, the young man had undertaken a detective journey to New Orleans, much to the disgust of such persons as held him to be the homicide. But the complications of this plot presently thickened into peril of revelations. Long before Nestoria had saved money enough to set out for the Cannibal Islands, Edward Wetherel returned to New York. Lehming heard of it, and, mindful of his promise to stand by the suspected youth, resolved to go at once and see him. Not finding him at his lodgings, he pushed on to the Dinneford dwelling, and made a call there. Mrs. Dinneford, sitting spectacled over Headley's âWomen of the Bible,â beamed forth delight at sight of his trivial figure, and bustled forward to greet him with capstrings a-flying. âWhy, Walter, how long you have been from us!â she cried in her hearty and little less than boisterous way. âI began to believe that you had fled to the desert and turned anchorite, like poor St. Simeon Stylites on his pillar, or like the old person in the `Book of Nonsense,' who ran up a palm when the weather was calm, and surveyed all the ruins of PhilÅ. It is more than a fortnight since you have visited our tabernacle. And we expected that you would give us the light of your countenance every evening!â âI ought to be ashamed of myself, and am,â said Lehming. âBut I have been amused, and been at work. Ah, what a blessing work is! It is the real sugarcoating of the pill of life. I have just finished a story which would not let me go until I had done my best by it. Moreover, I have some interesting fellow-lodgers, two young people who are developing under my eye, like buds turning to flowers. It is fascinating business to watch the growth of souls. It is, you know, my business. I am a school-teacher by nature and habit. It is my daily occupation, and I love it. I am really more delighted with the toddling of a youthful spirit from weakness toward strength than with the sublime march of a mind which has reached its full power. I humbly venture to believe that I can understand a little the pleasure which Deity takes in surveying the evolution and glorious unfolding of his creation.â âAh, Walter, you should have been a preacher instead of a schoolmaster,â replied Mrs. Dinneford. âI don't know how you kept out of the ministry. If ever a man that I know was called to wear the ephod and attend on the tabernacle, you are the man.â âI did think of it and desire it,â said Walter gravely. âYou remember that I went so far as to take orders.â Then he added with a smile, âBut how awkward it would have been to be obliged to carry about a cricket to stand on! Do you recollect a story about a little minister who made his audience giggle by just lifting his nose over the pulpit cushion and saying in a piping voice, `It is I, be not afraid'? That story, more than anything else perhaps, rooted up my vain ambition to be a clergyman.â Mrs. Dinneford laughed heartily. The anecdote bore hard upon her pygmy favorite, but she knew that he would not be hurt by her merriment. Moreover, she was one of those excitably jovial persons who do not find it easy to rule their sense of humor. She was a zealous church-goer; when she heard the bells ring, she rushed out like a fireman at the sound of the fire-alarm; and on reaching the scene of combustion, she did her duty as a hearer with heartfelt fervor; yet she had more than once âlaughed in meeting.â âBut I must tell you of my fellow-lodgers,â continued Lehming. âThere are two of them who honor me daily with their society, both young ladies, if I may apply the term to poor peopleâand to one of them I must apply it. She is interesting; she is fascinating. The other is a schoolmistress, an old acquaintance of mine, an untaught, uncultured soul, and rather a barren one. But the little lady is very different. I don't yet know what to make of her. She is a mystery and a waif. I wish you could see her.â âI wish I could,â said Mrs. Dinneford sympathetically. Then her mind was caught by that word âmystery,â and she flew away on the weird wings of it. She was a butterfly in discourse, driven about by the chance breezes of association, and capable of fluttering over a dozen topics in a minute. âAnd what a mystery that tragedy of poor dear Cousin Wetherel has become!â she continued. âWas there ever anything so huge and hideous of mien which so swiftly and completely descended into the shadows! It seems as if the Adversary himself, the great dragon of the Apocalypse, had come out before us in all his most monstrous ugliness, so big and vast as to straddle quite across the way of our lives, only to disappear in the twinkling of an eye. One is tempted to imagine that he was permitted to show us his miraculous power in revealings and vanishings. There we were in our little nest at Sea Lodge, as unsuspecting of harm as children at play, when suddenly the awful talons were in the midst of us, and one of our circle was stricken and lacerated unto death, and we neither heard the flutter of the wings nor saw the blow. Moloch, the bloody king, was gone as quickly as he had come. One would say that he had authority over nature, and could march with a cloud behind him, and cause earth to open under his feet. I never had anything so tax and terrify my imagination. I am ready to believe in the physical influences of the Lords of Hell, as Tennyson calls them, and a noble sounding name it is, to be sure, and shows him to be a great poet. Do you remember how the magicians of Egypt wrought with their enchantments, and how Elymas the sorcerer was full of all malice and subtlety of the devil, and how Satan contended with Michael for the body of Moses? It seems to me sometimes that we had cause for thankfulness in that the remains of our dear old friend and relative were spared us for sepulture. But Sin and Death left their victim; they only took away their instrument. The iniquity of the righteous cannot be hid; but the iniquity of the wicked is covered. I cannot get over it. My soul is in a perpetual astonishment. I have had to fly of late to the Bible for utterances big enough to relieve my spirit. My favorite Tupper has lost his power of charming. I find him as finite as myself.â Lehming looked at Mrs. Dinneford with surprise and almost with reverence. The under-abyss of sentiment and imagination in this variable, this sometimes commonplace woman, had flamed up as it were through her inconsequences of thought and oddities of diction, rendering her for the moment little less than sublime. âHappy is the soul which knows the Scriptures!â he said. âIt can always find fitting words for its mightiest impressions. There are occasional events in life which make even Shakespeare seem as limited as Tupper. But the School of the Prophets had an inspiration lofty enough to mate the highest spiritual needs of man.â âAh, yes,â murmured Mrs. Dinneford, with an intonation of gratitude. Then a sudden gleam of humor danced out upon her puritanic face, much as if a Greek faun should appear capering upon Plymouth Rock. âA poor, bewildered policeman came to me yesterday,â she resumed, âto ask some further questions about the Wetherel affair, as he called it. The helpless man looked utterly disconsolate over his lack of success in discovering even a trail of the serpent. He said he had been working at this millstone for a month without finding a hole in it. I did want to take up my Bible and read him a chapter to comfort him. But a false shame caught hold of my garments of worldliness and held me back. All I could muster the spirit to do was to quote a text or so.â âI dare say you confounded him,â smiled Lehming. âI doubt whether many New York policemen understand the speech of Zion.â âAh, the speech of Zion!â repeated Mrs. Dinneford with a sort of spiritual smacking of the lips. âWhat a power and two-edged sharpness there is in that language, meaning thereby the plain words of the Scriptures without note or comment. Did you ever hear how poor Cousin Wetherel hewed a Perfectionist in pieces before the Lord with a single text? It was at a prayer-meeting in West Haven last summer. This Perfectionist got the floor, and exhorted with wonderful glibness and zeal, and fairly seemed to have the universe his own way for a while, so that one almost looked for the host of heaven to bow down and reverence him. The poor deluded creature had not committed sin for a week, he said, and he was hot with us all to go and do likewise. When he sat down Cousin Wetherel aroseâand a grand, kingly, saintly spectacle he was, to be sure, with his white hair and persuaded countenance, and his settled eyes piercing through all the nonsense of earth unto the heavenly realities. It was an apparition. The West Haven brethren stared as if they expected a revelation. I thought of that regicide judge who used to appear to our New England fathers now and then, when they were in great straits, and work out some deliverance, or impart some counsel. He uttered just this one sentence: `If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us;' then he sat down. It was awful. It seemed as if the longest-lived of the apostles had himself revisited earth to remind us of his own text. There was an end of perfectionism for that evening.â Mrs. Dinneford had related this anecdote with as much gusto and cheerfulness as if Cousin Wetherel were still in the land of the living. Although he was murdered, and although she sincerely reverenced and lamented him, his eccentricities had not lost their power of amusing her, and she could laugh as well as weep over his tombstone. âBut didn't I interrupt you a while ago, Walter?â she inquired, after catching her breath. âIt seems to me that you were saying something which I broke into like a wolf into a fold. I am always blowing out other people's luminaries. Alice says I am as troublesome in a general conversation as a hornbug among lighted candles, flying now into this one and now into that, and extinguishing the whole batch.â âI think I was speaking of my fellow-lodgers,â replied Walter. âBut I had pretty much finished with them.â âOne of them was a young lady, wasn't she?â pursued Mrs. Dinneford. âAnd she interested you? I don't wonder. Young ladies are such pretty things! Woman as I am, I can feel their charm. Every now and then I meet a girl in the street whom I want to take home and adopt. And when they are alone in life, as I think you said this poor thing is, they pull at one's very heartstrings. They are so utterly helpless amidst the great rushings and strivings of this tumultuous, selfish world! A pretty girl without home or parents is scarcely better off than a baby left on a doorstep. If she doesn't meet with charity, she meets with death. Oh dear! the subject is a sad one; it cuts me like a knife. There is our poor little friend who vanished from among us as if Satan had put up his hand through the solid crust of the earth and drawn her into his abysmal darknesses. If she is alive, she is alone, and where? She hadn't a relative, nor scarcely an acquaintance, on this broad continent. I do wish, Walter, that you could have seen her. Such a beautiful, sweet, touching little thing! She fairly bewitched me. As Tupper says, `There is none enchantment against beauty, magician for all time.' And her loveliness had such an innocence, such an other-world purity! She was like a beam of heavenly starlight visiting and cheering a lost planet. I never saw such sunny hair and such sky-like eyes and such a lily of a face. She was a vision, and vanished like one. What is the matter with you, Walter? You seem to be absent-minded this evening.â Lehming's eyes were bent upon the floor with an expression of profound musing. Mrs. Dinneford's enthusiastic description of Nestoria had struck him with the force of a revelation. For the first time, and with a vividness which made him wonder at his blindness hitherto, the suspicion reached him that the fugitive from Sea Lodge and Nettie Fulton might be the same person.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIV. REAPPEARANCE OF THE FLIRTING PHILOLOGIST. For a moment Lehming was on the verge of saying to Mrs. Dinneford that he thought he had found Nestoria Bernard. But just then Alice Dinneford entered, fluttering and rustling and babbling in her usual lively way, like all the breezes and brooks of springtime. This young lady, as we perhaps remember, was sufficiently clever, and more than sufficiently talkative, to be quite diverting, or at least occupying; no matter how fallen and withered conversation might be, she could arouse it and send it flying and fill the air with it, like a gamesome urchin kicking up a bed of autumn leaves. âIs it you, Cousin Walter?â she prattled, while her willowy figure so swayed and her feathery head so tossed that she reminded him of a cypress in a high wind. âWhere have you been these three weeks? I thought you must be dead. I have expected every day to find you decapitated, with your body flopping about like a chicken's, and your head under some policeman's arm, smiling benignantly, as much as to say it was all right and you bore nobody any grudge. Now, mamma, don't go to making a gravestone of your face, and setting it up over me. I won't be buried alive while I can catch my breath. You talked a great deal more at my age, and you say everything you can think of yet. Cousin Walter, I know why you are always so cheerful and never have the doldrums. You are not a young lady. Young ladies must be proper, and propriety always gives the doldrums, just as measles bring weak eyes. Such hencoops of old patched-up decorums as we women live in! And if you stick your head out for a grain of corn, somebody is ready to grab you and pull off your feathers and eat you up and pick your bones. Here is mother in a clucking state because I sit up, as they say in the country, with a count. I told her I should leave it to you, the very first time you came in. Now do you think counts and foreigners are necessarily horrid? Are we Yankees commissioned and chosen to abhor them as the Jews abhorred the Canaanites? Do speak, Walter. Don't stop to meditate. I hate a sober second thought. It's a doleful, preachy phrase, as wizened and mean as a string of dried apples. Now tell me whether there is any sense to this prejudice against foreigners.â âI share the prejudice,â said Lehming gently. âWalter, I am ashamed of you,â answered Alice, beginning to color with a real excitement. âOh, Walter, to have a prejudice! How unphilosophical and uncharitable!â âNot because a stranger is not an American do I mistrust him,â continued Lehming; âbut because he is not at home; because he is surrounded by no public opinion to which he feels responsible; because he is too free from restraint for the good of human nature. We mortals are just so weak that we need all the social bonds to keep us from being wicked. Let us suppose a Turk in New York. He is far away from the judgment of his brother Ottomans, and he has not yet learned to care for the judgment of Yankees. Don't you see that he has fewer guards against temptation than I have, or than he himself would have at home? It seems to me that he runs great risk of becoming a naughty Turk.â âBut are we so very good?â broke in Alice eagerly. âWhat do you think of our city government? What do you think of the Ring?â âTake away the foreign vote of New York, and no ring could live long,â replied Lehming. âSo you think,â said Alice, beginning to pout, for the argument seemed to be against her. âBut I hate polities, and don't want to talk about it. What I can't bear is that mother has a special dislike to this man because he is a count. As if he would be any better if he were a butcher and the son of a baker and the nephew of a candlestick-maker!â âI don't want to be bewildered with words that I am not used to,â declared Mrs. Dinneford. âWhen a man tells me that he is a count, I don't know what to expect of him. It's as perplexing as if he should tell me that he was a jabberwok. And especially when he has no county! A count in a republic, getting his living nobody knows how, seems to me what our marketman calls a dubersome character, and I am always wondering what he was disinherited and banished for, and feel like addressing him in the words of Tupper, `O degenerate scion of a stock so excellent and noble,' which I dare say would bother the head of our poor man tremendously, for his brains are no thicker than batter, in my opinion.â âWait and see, wait and see,â retorted Alice. âI dare say he may be here this evening,â she added, coloring with the consciousness that she knew very well that he would be there. âHe is odd, but he is no fool. I used to think him one, and used to delight in making fun of him; but I have learned to know him better, and so will mamma some day; you see if she doesn't. I want you to talk to him, Walter; you will find that he has plenty of sense; that is, after you have got used to his ways. Why, I suppose the cats and dogs don't think that we know anything till they learn how to take us. And now don't go to imagining that I am smitten. No such thing; I am not. I just defend the poor man because mother is unjust to him.â âI hope that justice wouldn't be worse for him than injustice,â replied Mrs. Dinneford, with an earnestness which had a taint of irritation. Apparently this matter of the Count had been discussed between mother and daughter until it had become a sore subject to both of them. Just then the street bell rang, causing Alice to say, âThere he is!â with a slightly hysterical giggle, and to sway and flutter in a way that was characteristic of her in moments of excitement. Presently the door opened, and a tall, blond gentleman, glorious with jewels and with glossy expanses of fine linen and with elaborate tailoring, entered the parlor, bowing and smirking in a style to strike most Anglo-Saxons dumb with astonishment. It was the first time that Lehming had beheld our old acquaintance, Count Poloski. The intelligent, natural, and quiet pygmyâhimself, as we believe, one of nature's grandeesâlooked on the pretentious apparition with amazement and instantaneous distrust. It did not seem possible to him that a man who wore such millinery and went through such posturings could be a born patrician. However, he had seen the âGrande Duchesseâ; he remembered that grotesque specimen of nobility, Prince Paul; and, conceding the resemblance between the two men, he suspended his judgment. Bowing and âteteringâ across the room, the Count advanced to Mrs. Dinneford, took her hand, bent himself double over it, and said, âMadam, I once more do myself the honor of calling upon you.â âI hope you have been well, sir?â replied the good lady, with a brevity which we know was not natural to her, and which sprang from embarrassment. âMadam, it is impossible for me to thank you sufficiently for your good wishes,â the Count bowed again. âNever better. All the better for seeing you, as the song says. I need not inquire after your health. Your glowing countenanceâ (Mrs. Dinneford was fairly blushing for him) âreassures me. Miss Alice,â and here he doubled up over the hand of the daughter, âyour mother is a favorable augury for you. I trust that you will beâto use your vigorous American idiomâa chip of the old hickory.â We have never heretofore seen in Poloski so much âmannerâ as he had on this occasion. An avowed suitor now of the âdashing Miss Alice,â and anxious to make an impression upon the parent as well as upon the young lady, he had put on the airs of a continental Turveydrop. No turkeycock, gobbling and strutting and ruffling his feathers among female turkeys, was ever a more wonderful âmodel of deportment.â Lehming was unable to understand how Alice could accord any respect or interest to such a grinning, polking, hyperbolical harlequin. He did not know how far the excitement of a debated conquest may carry a young lady. The noble foreigner had made great inroads into Miss Dinneford's esteem, because she had found him a favored guest among the fashionables of Fifth Avenue, and because plenty of other girls were setting their caps at him. âCount Poloski, this is my cousin,â she said, fluttering through an incomplete introduction. âMy cousin, Mr. Lehming,â she added hastily. Poloski bowed and smiled as if he were being presented to a peer of the British realm or a luminary of the French Academy. âMy cousin is an author,â continued Alice, anxious to impress the patrician favorably in regard to her family. âAnd a schoolmaster,â added Lehming, which was the most malicious speech that he ever made in his life. âProfessor, I am honored in making your acquaintance,â salaamed the imperturbable Poloski. Alice triumphed over her cousin, and nearly laughed at him outright. âI am in the condition of a boy who gets a man's hat slipped over his little head,â smiled Lehming. âThe title of professor is too big for me.â âBut you teach,â cajoled the Count, determined to make things pleasant. âWhat branch, may I inquire? Latin? Your common schools, as you wrongly call them, are wonderful. They deserve a higher name. I am sincerely delighted to meet one who holds such a post in such a distinguished arena. I have some inquiries to make of you, if you permit them, and if these ladies permit.â And here he commenced a catechism concerning the origins of the Latin speech; inquiring particularly whether it were purely Oscan, or whether the long domination of the Tarquins had introduced Etruscan elements; and showing a knowledge of the subject which argued at least some intimacy with encyclopÃ¦dias. âYou are too much for me,â confessed Lehming. âI have no such learning as will solve those problems.â He looked at the fluent Poloski in surprise, wondering whether he were indeed a scholar and a gentleman. âI have beaten him,â triumphed the Count to himself. âHe was doubting me, but now he holds me in respect.â âI wrote an essay on this topic,â he said aloud. âI will show it to you some day.â âBut not to me,â put in Alice, with the excusable petulance of a young lady who has been kept over-long out of the conversation. âMiss Dinneford, I humbly beg your pardon!â exclaimed Poloski, spreading out deprecating hands. âI am the most degraded of imbeciles. How can a man pass his time in talking of dead tongues when he might learn from the loveliest of teachers the noblest of living tongues!â âWith all its beautiful slangs, Count,â added Alice, laughing. But she did not banter him as freely as of old. He was no longer in her eyes the purely comical personage which he had been in the days of their earlier acquaintance. In spite of her frolicsomeness and her affectation of flippant domination, it was obvious that she was very anxious to please him, and even considerably in awe of him. Lehming perceived all this, and was sorry to perceive it. He feared nothing worse for Alice than a marriage with a man who might be a mere adventurer, without a penny and without a character; but that was a sufficiently ugly outlook to make the smallest glimpse of it a worry to this sympathetic and kindly spirit; and before he left the house he had resolved to keep an eye on the noble foreigner. As he walked homeward he thought the little drama over, and became more interested in it with every heart-beat. Here was a piece of home philanthropy to be attended to, and it might be that it needed instant and earnest vigilance. âWe are always saving the heathen,â he said to himself. âI must save my relative.â To whom could he go to inquire about the antecedents and actualities and probabilities of this Poloski? Of fashionable people Lehming only knew Wolverton, whom he had met but twice, and Edward Wetherel. As it was still far from late, he decided to make one more attempt to find Edward, and he set off at the longest stretch of his brief legs toward the young man's lodgings. Unsuccessful again, he turned toward his own sombre quarter of the city, and walked on with a still quicker step than before, anxious not to miss his customary âgood-nightâ from Nettie Fulton. He had fallen to thinking of her, and was querying whether she could possibly be Nestoria Bernard, when a voice behind him called him by name. He turned and waited; it was Edward Wetherel. âHow lucky I am to meet you!â said Lehming. âI have been twice to your lodgings.â âAnd I was just searching for yours,â replied Edward. âIs it too late to make you a call?â âCome along,â urged Lehming. âI want very much to see you about something which concerns us nearly.â Presently it occurred to him that Wetherel might stumble upon Nettie Fulton in the reading-room, and that there might be a recognition. If so, then what? Would the scene be joyful or horrible? He could not tell; but it seemed to him that it would be best to risk it; that the sooner this mystery was cleared up the better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXV. DOLOROUS EAVESDROPPING. As Lehming was mounting the first stair of the tenement-house he came to a sudden halt and clung to the banister, panting. âWhat is the matter?â asked Wetherel seizing his little friend's arm, and marvelling to find it tremulous and palpitating. âI have walked too fast for you. You should have remonstrated.â âI am driven to confession,â gasped Lehming, who could not, however, tell all the causes of his agitation. âI haveâso my doctor tells meâa heart disease. Don't mind itâand don't apologize. I am fairly punished for not being willing to avow my infirmities. I have so many of them!â âA heart disease!â repeated Wetherel, surveying the sufferer with that superficial pity which a strong man may accord to an invalid, but at the same time able to admire him for not complaining. âYou are an example to me. Do you smile at all your troubles?â âI have learned to do it,â replied Lehming. âDo you remember that comic martyr, that model of patient endurance, in the `Book of Nonsense'? `There was an old man who said, How Shall I flee from this horrible cow? I will sit on this stile And continue to smile. Which may soften the heart of the cow.' That whimsical verse has been a prodigious support to me in my various little worries. The cow has bellowed and pushed a good deal, but I have generally been able to smile, and it has helped. Well, let us get on. I can storm a few more stairs now. How I should like to make one of a scaling-party!â Reaching the foot of the last stairway, he looked up with some anxiety. He remembered that, whenever any one mounted to that floor, Nettie Fulton was apt to step out of the study and glance over the banister, as if to spy into the nature of the visitor. Would she now make this little sally of inspection? Yes; there was her shadow against the wall; then it disappeared with a hurried rustle of female vesture. At once it seemed certain to Lehming that Nettie Fulton was Nestoria Bernard, and his heart fell to beating again with such violence that he had to pause for another rest. âWe seem to have disturbed some one,â tranquilly observed Wetherel, whose unconsciousness of the real nature of this scene is surely a striking feature of it. âOne of my fellow-lodgers, probably,â panted Lehming, as he slowly resumed his ascent. When he entered the reading-room his usually dark and sallow face was so ashy that his companion was alarmed by it. âLie down on your sofa,â said Wetherel with a sort of dictatorial kindness, quite natural to him. âThese piles of stairways are too much for you. You must positively give up this nonsense of refusing advances out of the estate, and take enough to put you in comfortable lodgings. A man with a heart disease mustn't have his bedroom on the top of St. Simeon's pillar.â Lehming thought to himself that, if Edward knew who was near, he also might turn pale. Then his mind glanced to Nestoria, hidden away in her own room, doubtless in extreme terror, perhaps fainting. But he kept his lips sealed upon the mystery; the time had not come for revelations. âDon't disturb yourself about me,â he muttered. âTake a seat and tell me the news.â Wetherel related the story of his southern expedition: how he had searched New Orleans for the murderer of his uncle; how he had searched, and found not. Lehming listened to him as one listens to a hum of conversation in another apartment, the sound of which is audible, but the words indistinguishable. His mind was filled, to the almost complete exclusion of other ideas, by a constant reiteration of two tremendous queries. Was this girl, who had just fled from Edward's presence, Nestoria Bernard? And, if so, what unendurable emotion, what terrible secret, had driven her to evade her betrothed lover? She might be the murderer; but no, that was impossible. She might know that Wetherel was the murderer; but no, that also could not be accepted. Tossed and whirled by these scaring suspicions and desperate denials, no wonder that Lehming listened without hearing. But there was another auditor, who was even far more agitated than he, and who could scarcely be said to draw the breath of the living. It must be explained that, when Nestoria looked over the stairway rail and saw her former lover, she lost her self-possession and fled, as thoroughly frightened and bewildered people do, without considering whither. Instead of rushing to her own room, she had leaped back through the open door of the study, and then, driven on by the noise of advancing feet, had taken refuge in a closet. The closet was large and nearly empty; it contained nothing but a timeworn chair which had been set aside by some bygone lodger; but this chair saved the girl from falling, and so from discovery. Dropping into it, she at first leaned back against the wall; but presently it seemed to her that the wild beating of her heart would surely be audible through the partition; and bending forward, she rested her arms upon her knees, with her head drooping. In this posture, and absolutely without stirring a muscle, she sat through the whole interview. Is it not easy to imagine the whirling tumult of struggling thoughts and emotions which filled the girl's brain and heart while she listened to Edward's voice and heard his story? Was it true that he had been seeking for the murderer? What could it mean? Was he innocent? Or was this search only a piece of monstrous and desperate hypocrisy? How could she disbelieve in his guilt? With her own eyes she had seen him strike the blow. And yet he had the assured tone of one whose soul is laden by no crime. There were moments when she was upon the point of rushing into the room and throwing her arms around his neck, or rather falling at his feet. Then the bloody scene in Judge Wetherel's study rose before her, and she shrank within herself at the thought of touching such a criminal. Still, she could not denounce him; somehow he was yet too sweet and beautiful to be brought to public scorn and to punishment; she felt that, even if she should face him with that intent, her tongue would be palsied. So she sat quiet, and listened; she answered and disputed him without being heard; she took such part in the dialogue as a ghost might. Indeed, it seemed to her at times as if she were really dead, and only present there as a helpless, speechless, and utterly wretched spirit. Then there was an impression of another ghost, the spectre of the murdered Judge Wetherel, crouching in the darkness beside her and hearkening to the discourse without. She almost felt this terrible visitant, and yet she did not stir a finger's breadth. She was tempted to scream aloud, and she withstood the scared urgency. Only an imagination made potent by lifelong familiarity with spiritualized beliefs could have inflicted such suffering. Only a character of singular firmness and self-command could have endured such an ordeal. But we must return to the audible and visible participants in this extraordinary scene. By the time that Wetherel had finished the narrative of his adventures in New Orleans Lehming had recovered his power of attention. âAnd so you learned nothing,â he said. âThe supposed trace was a delusion of the police.â âI merely wasted my time,â replied Edward. âOf course that is no matter. It is my duty to give my life to this mystery so long as there is a gleam of hope that it can be cleared up. To sit down quietly would be to confess myself a villain and to be one. How can I draw an easy breath until I have taken this noose of guilt and peril from around my own neck and put it where it belongs? You don't know how horrible I find it to be pointed at in the streets. The other day a boy called out, `There he is.' He meant some one else, but I thought he referred to me, and I stopped as if a policeman had collared me. I am sometimes weak enough and babyish enough to declare that there never was any torture like mine.â âHow many innocent ones, since the foundation of the world, have suffered likewise!â sighed Lehming. âIt perplexes and pains one's spirit to think of the mass of calumniation and undeserved sorrow that has been borne in all the ages. We suffer for each other's misdeeds as often as for our own.â âThere was one Innocent who suffered for all the guilty,â said Wetherel. âBut for the remembrance of that, I think that I might have been driven to suicide.â At hearing these words Nestoria scarcely restrained herself from coming out of her hiding-place and laying her hand on his shoulder. âI deserve it all,â continued Edward. âMy life has been such that men might well suspect me of crime.â' To Nestoria this sounded like a confession of blood-guiltiness, and of course like a very incomplete and inadequate confession, showing no profound and salvatory repentance. To Lehming, on the contrary, it seemed the exaggeration of a scrupulous soul, looking upon the ordinary excesses of youth as enormous misdeeds. Thus variously do we judge our fellow creatures, according to our differing lights and points of view. âWe must not deal over-harshly with ourselves,â said Lehming. âDo you remember how John Bunyan looked back upon his Christmas bell-ringings as deadly sins, and marvelled that Heaven had not visited him with instant judgment in the midst of them? It was undoubtedly an extravagance of self-condemnation. You should be careful to avoid such excesses of austerity. The Divine Reason is perfectly reasonable.â âI shall keep watch of myself,â observed Wetherel, after a pause. âThanks to my good health, my mind is mainly even in its pulse. I believe that I do not habitually overestimate my responsibilities and culpabilities. Repentance is just, but remorse is folly. I trust that I perceive the distinction between the two.â Notwithstanding the gravity of Leming's own spirit, he could not help marvelling at the gravity of his comrade. Here was a young man, who two months before had seemed destined to be a worldling for life, but whose character had now become solemnized, and, if we may use the timeworn phrase, spiritualized. He was still the same in person and face, tall and strong and upright, with fresh blonde cheeks and brave blue eyes and an air of hardy virility. But in soul he was another; he was the historical Wetherel; he was the Puritan. âYou had to break off your medical studies,â resumed Lehming, anxious to render the conversation more lightsome and to brighten his young friend's mood. âI shall go on with the course,â replied Edward. âI am resolved to be a physician. It seems to me the profession in which I can make myself most useful to my kind. A doctor can be a philanthropist without impertinence and as a natural part of his vocation. If he can do nothing better, he can gripe and nauseate poor people gratis,â he added, with a faint flash of that humor which belonged to him as a Wetherel, though in him it had of late been much in abeyance. Once more Nestoria was almost uplifted and borne into his presence by a throb of sympathy, of forgiveness, and of love. The mere word doctor was a claim upon her affection because it had been the title of her father. At this moment there were steps in the passage, and Miss Jones appeared at the door of the study. âI quite beg your pardon, Mr. Lehming,â she said in that stilted tone which she was apt to use before strangers. âBut I intrude upon you to ask if you have seen anything of my little friend.â âIs she out?â asked Lehming with a start of alarm. âHow could she go out alone at this hour?â âIt is even so,â mouthed Imogen Eleonore. âI have searched for her in vain. She must have fled into the dark, dark night.â All at once it occurred to Lehming that Nettie Fulton might have taken refuge in his closet; and with equal rapidity it flashed across him that in such case she must be Nestoria Bernard. No other supposition could account for the confusion and fright which must have been necessary to precipitate her into such a hiding-place. What should he do? Should he open the door, drag the girl into the presence of Wetherel, and force a solution of this fearful riddle?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVI. WILL SHE FLY? âI cannot repress the anxiety which fills me soul,â murmured Imogen Eleonore, who was obviously elocutioneering at the soul of Edward Wetherel. Lehming felt that this young lady was oppressive; it certainly would not do to open the closet door in her presence; he was nervously anxious to get rid of her. âIs it not possible that your friend has taken a walk with Mr. Bowlder?â he suggested. Imogen had advanced into the room with the deep and dark intent of getting herself introduced to the handsome and handsomely attired young visitor; but as Lehming did not present her, she was obliged in decency to come to a halt and to devise some âthrillingâ speech, under cover of which she might beat a retreat. âYour weird supposition is worthy of hopeful consideration,â she said with the even utterance of an automaton, and thereupon sweptâas she would have described itâout of the room, considerably irritated against Mr. Lehming. âYou have annoyed your friend, I am afraid, on my account,â gently remarked Wetherelâa changed and bettered young man certainly, for time was when he would have been hardheartedly amused at the discomfiture of this intrusive young lady, and would have made satirical remarks on her obvious craving after male company. âShe is a good-hearted, well-meaning girl,â replied Lehming. âI must say in excuse for her that I have made her welcome to this room and what there is in it. But she ought to have seen that we wished to be in private.â He was a little less considerate than usual, because the mystery of the closet perplexed and agitated him almost unendurably. What would be the result if he should fling open that door and bring these two people face to face? Was one of them the murderer, and did the other know it? If he should reveal Nestoria to Wetherel, it might give her an unsupportable shock; it seemed to him in his excitement that it might drive her mad, or kill her on the spot. In vain did he argue with himself that the mystery ought to be solved, and try to feel that it was his duty as a man and a Christian to hurry it to a solution. He made such progress as travellers toward the polar sea have made when the ice-fields under their feet slipped southward faster than they could toil northward. At the end of a minute of tumultuous reflection his sentiments had drifted him far back from the deed to which his conscience summoned him. It seemed to him as if untraversable spaces had intruded between him and that closet door; as if he could not reach it though he should journey toward it all night; as if it were in another planet. At last this sensitive and compassionate soul gave up the struggle to take hold upon a duty which a puissant imagination filled as full of perils and cruelties as the embrace of the deadly âVirginâ of the Inquisition was full of knives. He resolved that he would not precipitate a revelation; that he would suffer the girl to escape from her doubtless agonizing concealment; that he would see her alone the next day, and plead with her for an explanation; that he must even run the risk of her flying during the night. âIf you don't mind a little chilliness, we will go into my bedroom,â he said to Wetherel. âIt will give my disappointed fellow-lodger a chance to come back here and get a book, if she wants one.â âCertainly,â replied Edward. âWe can wear our overcoats. Besides, I shall not stay long. I must take a look at my text-books before I go to bed.â The two young men quitted the study, and were soon closeted in the bedroom. âI wanted to speak to you about our cousin,â continued Lehming, reverting to the subject which he had had in mind half an hour before. Then he told of the foreigner whom he had met at Mrs. Dinneford's, and hinted his fears that the man was wooing Alice with some chance of success. Wetherel had little to communicate concerning Poloski except that he was a gambler and was supposed to be a fortune-hunter, and that he might or might not be a count. âI am astonished that Alice should seem to care for him,â he frowned in a rather imperial way, very natural to male Wetherels. âShe has always known that I had no opinion of the fellow.â âOur girls are so easily carried away by a title!â said Lehming. âIt is natural; a title is a general letter of introduction; it opens the way to good society everywhere. And yet such a marriage as this would probably be a sad affair. American women are hardly ever happy with foreign husbands; they get too little consideration and have to concede too much obedience. Moreover, this man may not be a noble; may be a vulgar and rascally impostor.â âI must see to this!â observed Edward with the air of one who could not help feeling himself to be the head of the family, however much he might strive after the grace of meekness. âI am somewhat responsible for the acquaintance.â âIf we do nothing else all our lives, we shall have work enough in undoing our mistakes and mischiefs,â said Lehming, a man whose almost stainless purity of conduct did not save him from the inquisitions of conscience. Next there was some talk about Wetherel's plans for the future. It appeared that he intended to devote himself to the betterment of the industrial classes. âI shall practise gratuitously in the main,â he said. âI shall look up such patients as other physicians cannot afford to have. But that is not all. Do you know that our artisans and workingmen generally are running to their ruin, through ignorance of the elements of political economy? Look at these strikes. The strikers don't know that the raising of wages involves the raising of expenses. What they need is not higher pay, but cheaper living. Our present system of taxation is a plundering of the poor. Our tariff seems to be specially designed to enhance the cost of the materials of labor and of the necessaries of life. It works almost exclusively for the benefit of a few hundred capitalists and monopolists, who are rich enough to overawe and perhaps to bribe our politicians. But you know all this; I won't tire you with it. What I propose is a course of lectures to workingmen on political economy and on household economy also. The laboring classes need all sorts of practical instruction. They are absurdly and ruinously extravagant; their wives have silk dresses, and their babies velvet jackets. I find young fellows who earn twenty-five dollars a week and spend half of it in cigars, drinks, frolicking, militia displays, and other follies. They growl at capital without seeing that they are themselves to blame for the fact that they are not capitalists. But the subject is too attractive; it is irritatingly inexhaustible. I become tiresome when I commence on it.â âWill democracy destroy us?â sighed Lehming. âIn a democracy every citizen is tempted to want to be as fine and as much at leisure as any other citizen. And the women are madder than the men; their one demand is for idle elegance.â âOur cultivated classes must put their shoulders to this load,â declared Wetherel, with the enthusiasm of youth. âCan't you give a lift? You know that abundant pecuniary means are at your command. By the way, when will you take your share of that estate?â âHow long can the settlement be put off?â inquired Lehming. âA year from the decease.â âGive me that time,â smiled Walter, a pygmy who was fit to have the power of a giant, so little was he likely to abuse it. âI know perfectly well that I am not an heir, and I don't want to be hustled into heirship. Of course you give the Dinnefords whatever you like, and they will probably submit, and ought to. They are women, and are used to being supported by others, and to have others decide for them. But a man is responsible for his own moral code in matters of property. I must have time to consider this business of taking your money. Let us talk of it toward the end of the year.â âVery well,â nodded Edward with a fine tranquillity, and took his departure. Lehming now returned to his study, looked with a beating heart into the closet, and found it empty. On the floor of it, however, he discovered a little silk neckerchief which he recognized as belonging to Nettie Fulton. There was of course no longer much doubt in his mind that the girl had been hiding there, and almost as little doubt that she was the refugee from the horror and mystery of Sea Lodge. After gazing at the neckerchief for a moment, he wrapped it carefully and one might say reverentially in a piece of white paper, and put it in the breast pocket of his coat, very near his beating heart. Then he went softly to the door of Miss Jones's room, tapped gently, and, when the schoolma'am made her appearance, asked if Miss Fulton had returned. âYes,â answered Imogen Eleonore. âI went to inquire for her in the apartment below, and came back as quick as ever I could, and here she was. I should like you to tell me, sir, what I am to think of it,â she added, with an air of laying all the responsibility on Lehming. But the young man had no desire to talk over the matter, and so he said he was glad that Miss Fulton had been found, and began to smile himself away. âI can't stand this much longer,â continued Miss Jones in a hissing whisper, much like the voice of a blown football suffering from a puncture. âI think you ought to speak with her about her mysterious ways,â urged this young woman who was bursting with a long-endured colic of curiosity. âShe's as pale as a spectre of the gloomsome night, and she won't tell me where she has been.â Lehming halted. âCall me, if she seems to be ill,â he said energetically. Then, without further hearkening, he glided hastily away, whereupon Imogen slammed her door in a pet. The burdened Lehming returned to his study, and seated himself before his smouldering fire. He was sorry that Miss Jones should be offended; but in a minute or so he had entirely forgotten her. He could think only of Nestoriaâ how to prevent her from taking flight, perhaps before morning, and how to draw her out of her doubtless wretched and possibly wrongful seclusion. He felt sure that never during her whole life could she have any real happiness, unless she revealed all that she knew (and she must know something) of the murder of Judge Wetherel. He was persuaded that it was her duty to make such a revelation, even though it should fill her heart and other hearts with incurable sorrow. The supposition that she might herself he the assassin he rejected absolutely, notwithstanding that it was held by many people, and a reward had been offered for her apprehension. Then he had to grapple with the terrible hypothesis that, if she accused any person of blood-guiltiness, that person would probably be Edward Wetherel. âWell, so be it,â he whispered, drooping his head to his knees and burying his face in his hand. âIt is her duty to bring the wrong-doer to punishment, though she and all of us suffer grief and shame beyond estimate. If blood be upon his soul, she must give him up, and we must all give him up. O, Heaven! with this thought upon my mind, how could I face him as calmly as I did! O, almighty and pitying Father, let it not be as we think! Let that cup pass from us! But if it must come to our lips, give us strength to drink it! No, there must be no putting away of justice; there must be no evasion of righteousness. She must speak, and I must make her.â So he went on, fighting with suspicions and horrors, for hour after hour. We often hear of passing a night without sleep; it is an almost superhuman feat and seldom accomplished; but Lehming did it. His mental trouble alone might not have kept him waking, but he felt it his duty to watch against the flight of Nestoria. Wrapping himself in his overcoat, he moved his chair close to his partially open door, and listened for the sound of stealthy feet in the passage. If he found himself inclined to doze, he paced the room for a minute or two in his stockings, and then resumed his ward. The dull hum and murmur of the great city around him sank little by little into a perfect, solemn, and awful silence. From time to time a bell, which he remembered that he had never heard before, gave him notice of the death of the hours. This solitary sound, recurring after such weary intervals, and striking into the midst of tragic reflections and anxieties, seemed to him funereal. His powerful and sombre imagination awoke at the summons, spread its raven wings, and flew abroad through the night, seeking out spectacles of sorrow. He heard in fancy all the bells that ring for the burial of men, extorting the fierce or despairing grief of mourners all over the world. He saw the black, slow corteges of those who cannot be comforted. The vast ocean of universal human misery rolled in upon and swelled his own wretchedness. It was such a night of sadness and boding as only a most sensitive imagination can know. A little after two in the morning he started up from his seat with an impression that footsteps were gliding through the hall toward the stairway Stepping out of his room as noiselessly as possible, he put forth one hand at a venture in the darkness, and caught a figure wrapped in a shawl or some other womanly vestment. There was a low cry, and an attempt at retreat; but Lehming held firm with one trembling hand, while with the other he drew a match against the wall. As he expected he beheld the slight form and childlike face, now pale and terrified enough, of Nettie. âWhat do you stop me for?â she burst out in a harsh, eager, passionate whisper. âCome into my study and let me speak to you before you go,â he replied. âMy poor child, only one moment!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVII. PERSUASION AND EXPLANATION. THE flickering aureole of the waxen match which Lehming held between himself and Nestoria lighted up two pale, quivering, anxious, imploring faces. One of these countenances pleaded with all the eloquence of affection, of benevolence, and of conscious duty for one minute of speech and remonstrance. The other pleaded with the still more intense fervor of keen misery and terror for liberty to depart without a word into the unknown, into friendless flight, into lifelong hiding. They were much more than mere faces; they were souls encountering each other. Neither saw the other's physical features; eyes looked far deeper than the color and sparkle of eyes; they penetrated to the sufferings and longings within. It was a meeting of vast import; one of those meetings which must have more than earthly consequences; one of those meetings which are worthy of the interest of seraphs and demons. Here were two beings gifted with immense power of desire and of suffering; two imaginations which were mighty enough to create heavens and hells; two consciences of almost superhuman range and sensibility. Here was a cherubic spirit on the verge of erring, and an archangelic spirit striving to save. âThe light has burned out,â whispered Lehming, as he let the remains of the consumed match fall from his hand. âIt seems to me as if we had met in the darkness which stretches beyond the grave. Can you not look upon your present purpose as you will look back upon it in your future existence? I have an idea that you are about taking a step which will be decisive of your character through all the hereafter. Can you not think it over again before you finally decide upon it? Meditate it once more in my presence. I will not utter a word of advice or query unless you wish it. I will neither help nor hinder by any act. All I want is that, before you depart, you shall be sure that departure is right.â Nestoria, trembling from head to foot, did not answer; she appeared to have no more life than sufficed to keep her from falling. Notwithstanding the complete darkness, she could still see Lehming as plainly as ever; and she could not withdraw the gaze of her soul from that sympathetic and benevolent countenance. Sallow, irregular, and homely as it was, she had learned to look upon it with liking and veneration, because it was so obviously the index of a pure and compassionate spirit. And in this interview, under the brief light of a moment since, it had so shone with heavenly yearning and counsel, that it could neither be forgotten nor repelled. It seemed to her, wandering as she was in a tempest of trouble, that she had met some holy one walking upon the waters, able to stretch forth a victorious hand and save. Her conscience, her strong and spiritualized imagination, all the righteous influences of her earlier life, pressed her to lean toward this deliverer and accept his help. She only needed a gentle and almost unfelt touch upon the arm to turn her back from the stairway by which she had meant to fly from all who had ever seen her. In a moment more they were in the study, and the door was closed against chance listeners. Lehming lighted his lamp, and saw that the girl was shivering as with an ague; he stirred the embers which he had left purposely in his fireplace, and roused a cheering blaze. For a little while they crouched over the flame, merely warming themselves in silence, for both were chilled with watching. At last the young man raised his large head, and looked auxiously into the face of his guest. He was touched almost to tears by her expression of unutterable perplexity, anxiety, and grief. Never before had he seen such an agonizing revolt of mighty emotions against a mighty conscience. âMay I speak freely?â he asked in a whisper. âYes,â gasped Nestoria, without lifting her eyes from the faces and phantoms of another world which leered and grimaced at her from amid the charring coals. âWhat I have to say will be hard to bear,â he continued, dreading to inflict further suffering. âI can bear everything,â replied the girl, remembering with a shudder how much she had already borne. âI must say then that I know you,â he went on with difficulty. âYou are Nestoria Bernard.â Nestoria made no reply; she shuddered at hearing her own name, as if she dreaded and hated it; but she still clung as firmly as she could to her secret. âHere is your neckerchief, which I found in that closet,â he said, producing it. âI understand how you came there. You ran in to escape from Edward Wetherel.â Still Nestoria did not confess, or confessed only by silence. âI wish you could see it to be your duty to reveal the cause of your flight from Sea Lodge,â he murmured with a sense of choking, as if the hangman's noose were around his own neck. A minute passed without a word from either. Several times Nestoria's lips moved, but they gave forth no sound. Meantime the two continued to look at each other with indescribable fixity and eagerness. âIs there not a soul at stake in this matter?â he said at last. âYesâmine!â she answered, shaking her head desperately. âBut I cannot save it. It must go.â âOh, no!â he protested, fearful of driving her quite to despair. âWe must make allowance for differences of judgment. You may be right in your reticence. Time will show.â Then he sank into a wretched silence; he feared that Edward was the murderer. âAh, yes, I may be right!â Nestoria burst out, after a few moments of meditation. âThere may be some mystery, some incomprehensible delusion, in this horrible thing. Oh, there may be, there may be! Perhaps I ought to wait; perhaps it is my duty. O God of mercy, grant that it may be so, and that I may not die before I see it to be so!â âCan you tell me nothing?â asked Lehming. âCan you not give me a chance to judge your doubts?â She looked at him with a dazed expression which might have meant that she wanted to evade his question, or might have meant that she did not understand it. He decided that it was proper and necessary to speak with unmistakable plainness. âLet me lay the whole thing before you,â he resumed. âYou were in the house of Judge Wetherel on the night of his death. Before morning you had disappeared, and you have remained in hiding ever since. It is believed by some misled people that you struck the blow which ended the old man's life!â He paused; but Nestoria did not answer, nor look up; she had evidently considered the probability of this suspicion against herself; it was already an idea so familiar that it did not surprise, nor even shock her. âIt is believed by others that you witnessed the tragedy, and that you were driven from the house by terror for yourself,â continued Lehming. The girl remained impassible; she did not dissent by either word or look; but he guessed that this was not the true statement of the case. âOthers believe,â he persisted, âthat you recognized the murderer, and that you fled in order to avoid bearing witness against him.â He stopped breathless. All his manhood, strength of mind, and sense of duty had scarcely sufficed to enable him to make this terrible declaration. He had feared, and at the same time had fully expected, that she would be overcome by it. He was disappointed. Nestoria did not utter a sound, and did not so much as move. The volume of moral force which lay in this small, youthful, and seemingly fragile creature was prodigious. She had long been prepared to meet such a trial as this in some form or other, and now that it had come she endured it with a composure which was almost more than human. Not a vast intellect, not capable perhaps of a many-sided development, not gifted to express even what was in her in any remarkable fashion, she had a depth of feeling and a singleness of purpose and a tenacity of will which fitted her to endure heroically. Face to face with a man who unveiled the horrible secret of her life, and charged her with what she wretchedly felt to be her great crime, she made no avowal either by word or glance. As she had resolved to be silent and impassible if ever she should be brought before a court of justice, so she was silent and impassible now. And the wonder of this moralâor immoralâachievement was that she accomplished it in despite of a sense of guilt from which her very soul revolted. The greatest and saddest feature of her victory was that it was a victory of sentiment over conscience. âHave you nothing to tell me?â inquired Lehming, after long waiting. Still Nestoria did not respond; she was meditating, and she would not speak until she had thought her thoughts clean out; not until she had surveyed all the consequences which might follow on utterance. âI had hoped to be able to counsel you,â Lehming presently added. âI find that I can only counsel myself.â âTo surrender me?â she asked sharply. âYou as good as promised not to do that. I understood you so when I came in here.â âI will not surrender you,â he said. âBut ought you not to surrender yourself?â âWait!â replied Nestoria. This single word was the result of her long and laborious and miserable deliberation. It was uttered most impressively, with a tone of finality, and with a look of unalterable decision. âPlease to tell me more fully what you mean,â he begged, meanwhile gazing at her with wonder. âOh, how hard it is to explain!â she groaned. âI want time. I am not yet satisfied. I still doubt what my eyes told me. I cannot doubt, and yet I must. Some day I may tell, but not now. I must have more time, more time, I can't say how much. But I will stay here; that isâwill you keep my secret? If you will keep my secret, I will stay. Otherwise I will go at once. I know that you can't keep meâthat you won't try to hold me. But if you will promise me your silence, I will stay. I want to stay. I can trust you; I can trust your word, and your wisdom, and your heart; you are the only person in the world whom I can trust fully. Now if you will give me your word not to expose me, I will give you my word to remain here untilâ until â. Ah, no! I dare not pledge myself,â she added, shaking her head. âSome other discovery, some other meeting, might drive me away in a moment. I cannot pledge myself.â Interested and agitated as Lehming was, he noted her forethoughtedness and her respect for truth with amazement, and said to himself that a girl who in such circumstances could retain so clear a mind and scrupulous a conscience deserved confidence. âDo you know who I am?â he asked. âYou are Alice's cousin,â she answered. âI remember hearing her speak of you. She only called you Cousin Walter. I did not recognize you until ââ âUntil you heard me talking just now with him,â he added, completing her sentence. Nestoria nodded slightly. She could not be induced to mention the name of Edward Wetherel, nor to allude to him in any distinct fashion, for fear, doubtless, that if she once began to speak of him, she might say too much. âMrs. Dinneford and Alice love you dearly,â Lehming went on. âThey are full of anxiety about you. Will you let me tell them where you are? Can't you trust them?â Nestoria's heart yearned for these two friends; but she said to herself that, if she became known to them, she might meet Edward; and she felt that that was an interview which she could not endure. In response to Lehming's question she covered her face with her hands and shook her head violently. âThen we two must keep this secret alone,â he said sorrowfully. âI will promiseâit is a tremendous thing to do, and I fear a wicked oneâbut I will promise not to reveal who you are until you give me leave to do so, unless indeed I am suddenly driven to call in others to save you from urgent danger. I do this not because I approve of your decision, but to save you from flying into lifelong hiding, remorse, misery, and perhaps into eternal ruin. I do it in the hope that you will yet be led to see your duty, and to perform it, however terrible it may be. I also hope that, if we wait a while, we may discover something better than you believe. If I am wrong, God forgive me!â In silence and with an air of profound abstraction Nestoria rose, threw her shawl over her arm, picked up her little travelling-bag, and moved toward the door. âWhere are you going?â he inquired anxiously, but without stirring to check her. âI am going to my own room,â she said, looking him in the face with a trustfulness which demanded trust. âMay the Heavenly Mercy grant you sleep!â he responded. âMy poor, heavy-laden child, good-night!â She passed out; she was as noiseless as a shadow; he listened in vain for a sound which should indicate whither she had gone; after a while he extinguished his lamp, stepped into the dark hall, and went to his bedroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVIII. A SORE CONSCIENCE AND TENDER HEART. Lehming went to his room not alone, for a train of perplexities and anxieties followed him, and, as we have already said, he did not sleep. He had such a sense of guilt that it seemed to him as if he had never done wickedness before, although during his pure life a scrupulous conscience had wounded him with many arrows. âParticeps criminis!â he repeated to himself a hundred times. âI am aiding and abetting in the concealment of a murderer. I am helping to hide one who has shed the blood of his father's brother; the assassin of an old man as venerable for goodness as for years.â âIs it possible?â he queried as often. âHave I not misunderstood this poor, confused child? Has she not misunderstood events? What are the grounds of her conviction? Eyesight? She can hardly mean less; nothing less would have driven her from her betrothed lover; she is too true in heart to be moved by less.â âI cannot believe such a monstrous thing,â he declared over and over again. âEdward never was evil enough to commit a crime. He had in those days no conscience toward God, but he had a conscience toward man. He would break divine laws but not human laws. There are thousands and thousands of such cases. There are infidels and atheists whose lives are stainless, honorable, beautiful. We who believe cannot comprehend it, but we are compelled to admit it. Edward was honorable; he was a gentleman; he could not murder.â There were moments during which he tried to persuade himself that Nestoria was insane. âBut no,â he decided; âI cannot believe it any more than I can hope it; a clearer, steadier intellect never came face to face with mine. Madness could get no hold on such physical and mental health as hers. In all the sorrow and terror which must have tormented her she has not even had a brain fever. Looking at such a constitution as that, I must concede her entire sanity.â âAh! there is some error,â he frequently insisted, or rather pleaded. âSome day events will force the real murderer to light, and compel him to say to Edward, You are innocent! Some day the mists of this mystery will blow away, and we shall behold the actual fact of crime, hideous enough, but endurable. Denunciation now might be calamitous and horrible falsehood. Nestoria is right; we must wait. There is no peril to justice in waiting. Edward will not fly; not even though he be guilty; least of all if he be guilty.â âWait!â was his final conclusion. He started from it and returned to it many times; he was like a bird tied by the leg who flutters uselessly; it was in vain that his conscience and his reason strove to tear him away; his promise and his wishes both bound him to that word, Wait. In these struggles the darkness of latter night and the grayness of early morning flitted by. He was accustomed to rise at sunrise, breakfast on a roll and a cup of coffee which he made for himself, and go over the lessons which he would have to hear during the day, coaching up in them as carefully as if he were pupil instead of teacher. This morning he was tempted to lie a while later; his head reeled and his whole feeble body ached with the fever of sleeplessness; but, with that martyr-like spirit which formed a large part of his character, he resisted the temptation. It was a trial to him to approach his mirror and face its pitiless candor. He knew that he should be uglier than usual; that he should find himself little less than repulsive. He was not one of those plain people who can create an illusion about their own plainness, discovering in it some redeeming feature, which makes amends for surrounding imperfections, and drawing therefrom a comfortable sense of self-admiration. From the earliest days of childhood that he could remember, he had been keenly conscious of his utter lack of comeliness; and the response of looking-glasses, that benediction of simple joy to so many, had always been to him a message of wretched humilitation. With beautiful meekness and self-control he had fought with this aversion to a keen spiritual pain, and forced himself into long contemplation of his ugliness. Every day he made it a point to stand for a minute or so before his mirror, surveying his misshapen head, his irregular features, and his yellow complexion, and saying to himself with self-loathing, but with submission, âThus it has pleased God to make me.â This morning the trial was doubly hard to bear. Never before had he been so desirous of appearing so far agreeable to himself as to give him a hope of becoming agreeable to some fellow creature. Nestoria, with her childlike and touching beauty, her immense sorrows, and her sweet endurance, had dazzled his intellect and won his heart. He believed that she would never return to the man whom she had loved, and that some day, in pure loneliness and grief, she would intrust herself to some other protector. To be that other Lehming was willing to sacrifice whatever other good there might be for him in life, and to complete the gift, if need be, with his death. Yet he knew that the moment he came face to face with his mirror, he should see himself to be totally unworthy of the affectionate regard of any woman. He approached the cruel truth-teller with as much repugnance as if it were a mortal foe, ready to plunge a dagger into his breast. He looked into it; he beheld his long, coarse face, squalid with trouble and want of rest; he suffered under the spectacle, but he did not flinch from it. To this remorseless Moloch he dragged all his delicate, throbbing hopes, and sacrificed them as the Tyrians sacrificed their little ones. He did not turn away until it seemed to him that the inhuman offering had been completed. âI must live for others,â he said as he left the mirror. âNo one but a dog would ever live for me. If I had a little less reason and faith than I have, I should say that the Redeemer could not have died for me, so insignificant and despicable do I seem to myself.â An hour later, after he had prepared his lessons, he heard the step of Imogen Eleonore in the passage, joined her, and inquired after Nettie. To his great relief (for up to this moment he did not know that the girl had not fled) he learned that she was in her room asleep. In his place another man might have been annoyed because she could slumber while he had waked through both night and dawn on her account. Lehming felt only pleasure and wonder, as if over a beneficent miracle. âWhat health!â he marvelled to himself. âWhat health of mind and body! Lesser troubles and perils than hers have sent men into sleepless nervousness, ending in insanity. What is not such an organization capable of?â That day he gave out to his scholars as the subject for English composition, âHealth.â âHealth of body and of mind,â he lectured with enthusiasm. âWithout it we can do little or nothing. From health we get that calmness and that endurance in labor which make labor effective. At twenty-two the young CondÃ© slept until the opening guns of his first battle. From the tranquil and restorative slumber of health he was awakened with difficulty to win the decisive victory of Rocroi. Nature, or rather the Allfather who is nature, had planned him for vast toil and great deeds. If you wish to accomplish much, you must establish health as a starting-post. It is to the man of genius what the earth was to AntÃ¦us; if he cannot touch it in his falls, he falls never to rise again. Without it there can hardly be any splendid productiveness or large usefulness.â All that day he saw nothing of Nestoria, and knew of her only that she had not fled. In the evening he went to his study, laid out the unfinished manuscript of a story (for boys), and tried to write. But the chariots of fancy drave heavily, and he could not get through a single sentence. He opened a book; of course it was a masterpiece of one of his favorite great authors; he wanted a strong and noble stimulus for his flagging spirit. But the pages of Hawthorne were as dull and cold to him as were the pages which lay before him in his own handwriting. A night without rest, followed by a day of anxiety and wearing inward debates, had utterly jaded both body and mind. Gradually his long, unshapely chin drooped to his prominent breast-bones, and he sank into the hard, horny gripe of the sleep of utter exhaustion. Roused after a time by the consciousness of some presence, he became aware that Nestoria was sitting by his fire and gazing upon his face, meanwhile warming her little hands with a kitten-like grace and tranquillity. She greeted his awakening with one of her peculiar smiles, a smile which was full of sweetness as well as of plaintiveness, reminding him of sunshine beaming through the curtains of rain. âI am glad you have slept,â she said in a soothing tone, as if she were a nurse and he her patient. âI am afraid that my troubles kept you awake last night.â âYour voice is like an Ã¦olian harp,â he answered dreamily. âIt sings because of storms, or in spite of them.â There was no reply, except that her smile became a thought more sad, while retaining all its sweetness. âI am greatly obliged to you for not going away,â he presently continued, recovering his waking senses. âYou promised to remain, but it was a promise hard to keep. I hope and believe that you will not be suffered to repent of it.â âI stayed to confide in you,â she said. âYou are so good and sympathetic that I cannot help trusting you, and leaning upon you. Now that my father and Judge Wetherel are gone, it seems to me that you must be the best man in the world. I cannot make up my mind to leave you I must have at least one comforter in all this wretched earthly wilderness. It is dangerous to stay; but I cannot, cannot goâat least not yet.â âYou force me to do what you wish,â he responded, after surveying her for some time in great perplexity of soul. âI still believe that I ought to urge you to go before the authorities at once, and tell all you know. I still feel that it is my duty to demand that step of you. But I am unable to demand it. I must let you judge this tremendous matter for yourself. You must have the time for deliberation that you require. We will wait.â âWe must!â she decreed with quiet firmness, and seemingly without considering difficulties or adverse arguments, just as a child says, âI must have the moon.â On this basis they continued their life. Lehming had hoped to gain, little by little, such an influence over the girl as would enable him to persuade her into discharging her conscience of the load which oppressed it, and into clearing up the mystery which had thus far balked the inquisitions of justice. But instead of his mind encroaching upon hers, it was hers which day by day gained empire over his. The moral force which springs from feeling was in this case too mighty for the moral force which springs from conscience. The woman's instinctive resoluteness defeated the man's superior reason. He was almost carried away by her. He began to think of accepting his portion, or at least some portion of the Wetherel estate, and devoting it to her service. Would he be justified, he occasionally asked himself, in transporting her to a foreign land, where she might be safe from the houndings of law, and pass her days without terror? As yet he had not the presumption to query whether it might not be right for him to unite her blighted life to his own blighted life. He bowed down to her in secret; he silently gave her all that exuberance of affection in his nature which no one had cared to reap; in one plain word, he loved her. But he was too humble, too keenly aware of what he considered his repulsive imperfections, to approach the idea of marrying her otherwise than slowly and unconsciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIX. A RATIONAL AND A WHIMSICAL COMFORTER. Nestoria had now more peace of mind than had been hers since her flight from the scene of the murder. She had, as it seemed to her, made a confidant of Lehming; and every infant knows the comfort that there is in telling one's trouble. In actual fact she had barely hinted to him the solution of this horrible Wetherel problem, so that a soul less sympathetic and clever than his might have altogether misapprehended her. But so clear and obvious to her mind was the whole labyrinth of crime, that it appeared to her as if her few vague words had pointed out every bloody footstep which tracked its obscure intersections. At times, indeed, she said to herself that she had divulged far too much, and was angry at her weakness and terrified at her imprudence. But, on the whole, her overflow of confidence, and the sense of sympathy obtained, soothed her. Her eyes began to beam their natural sunshine, and there was less plaintiveness and beseeching for pity in her smile, while her conversation sparkled now and then with the intrinsic lightsomeness of youth. âHow strangely we get used to things!â she one evening said to Lehming âOnce I would not have thought it possible that I should see the weeks which I have seen, and yet preserve sanity and life. But here I am; I still have my reason and draw my breath; indeed, it sometimes appears to me that I am not even changed. I have just been reading a description of the siege of Port Hudson, telling how accustomed the artillerymen became to the bombardment, and how they slept alongside of the roaring guns. The noise and the danger were ordinary circumstances to them. It is just so with me. I am usually as calm as I was in the days of innocence and safety. It seems like a stupor; and yet I am not stupefied; I am merely tranquil. It is a terrible mystery. One feels like saying that the human soul is capable of too much. It is capable of living quietly in sin and sorrow, as well as in holiness and prosperity. Are we right in pitying the poor and ignorant on the ground that they are wretched? Perhaps they are as contented as the rich and wise. We should pity them mainly for being thus contented with curses instead of longing and striving after blessings. I understand now the lives of criminals. I used to suppose that they were constantly tormented by remorse and terror. The sad knowledge has come to me that it is not so. They are generally easy in their minds. They are like me. Perhaps I have suffered more with remorse than any brutal murderer now living. And yet I bear it; my hand does not tremble when I paint; I hit the right colors without effort; I paint better every dayâbetter and more easily. One might suppose that there was no curse upon me for duty unfulfilled.â âFew can endure like you,â sighed Lehming, who was often impatient of the physical feebleness which he found in himself. âYou are a marvel of health. Under your load I should be crushed. Even the trifle of it which you have given me to carry, seems at times nearly too much for me.â âI am sorry for it,â she said humbly. âI ought to have gone away without a word. I have been weak and selfish.â Lehming looked at her with wonder and almost with reverence. He said to himself that he had never known in one so young such elevation of sentiment and keenness of reflection. Had he seen her while she was at Sea Lodge, and so been able to estimate the great advance which she had made since that time in both moral and intellectual force, he would have been still more astonished. The bearing of constant peril and vast sorrow had developed this lately girlish spirit surprisingly and with surprising rapidity. âDon't mind about having laden me,â said the deformed young man. âIf I cannot live a little for others, I count myself nothing worth. I only regret that you cannot see your way clear to do your instant duty, however painful it may be.â âAh! don't talk of that!â implored Nestoria, drooping her sunny head. âNot yet! Wait!â âDo you know that Edward Wetherel proved an alibi?â he continued, venturing boldly upon the subject which he believed to be her torment. âHe proved that he was in New Haven on the night of the murder.â âDid he?â exclaimed Nestoria, her face turning crimson. âOh, did he?â âI heard the testimony,â replied Lehming, trembling with the eagerness of hope. âThe witnesses were wild fellows, but at the time I did not doubt them.â For a minute or so the girl remained silent. She was studying over and over the picture which her memory presented of the assassination, and striving to eliminate from it the form and features of Edward Wetherel. The task was impossible; the figure reappeared as fast as she rubbed it out; it had a cruel, a ghoulish tenacity of existence. The flush of joy in her cheeks faded under its battenings to a plaintive pallor. Lehming's sensitive spirit divined from this change in her countenance that she knew of something which would not let her give lasting credit to his cheering tale. The subject became hateful to him, and he wrenched himself away from it. âI wish we had some enlivening amusement for you,â he said. âI should likeâif it were not too mad a wishâto take you to see a comedy.â She glanced at him with surprise, and replied, âI thought the theatre was very wicked.â âIt is a matter of regret that so many good people have thought so,â observed Lehming. âThe Church lost a strong grip on humanity when it denounced the drama and gave it over into the hands of the irreligious. Men need relaxation, and will have it. Devout minds should have recognized the fact, and should have provided pure public amusements, theatrical and others. A Christianized theatre would be a means of teaching, capable of reaching ears that will not hearken to the pulpit.â âI can understand that it might be so,â nodded Nestoria, after due reflection, such as she habitually gave to a new idea before accepting it. âI should like to see something amusing. I should like,â she added, the corners of her mouth trembling piteously, âto laugh once more.â At this moment they heard a singular sound in the hall. It was a shuffling and thumping, as of some one dancing, and dancing, too, with all his might, like King David in his linen ephod. Then the door opened, and the bushy, grizzled hair and beard, and the rosy face of John Bowlder appeared, accompanied of course by that philosopher's bulky and cumbrous figure. He looked bigger than ever, for he was clad in a flowered calico dressing-gown, which was voluminous enough to wrap up a middle-sized steeple comfortably, and which bagged and swung in all directions to get away from its wearer. He was dancing; there could be no doubt of the capering fact; he was performing some kind of an untaught, unteachable, unexampled jig; such a jig as was never produced to human eyes before, and without supernatural assistance never will be again. A colt let loose in a meadow, or a calf welcoming its mother home from pasture, never accomplished such unbroken plungings and kickings and buttings. Meantimeâa philosopher through it allâhe had the rapt air of a whirling Dervish. His haystack of a head was thrown back in a kind of ecstasy, and a childlike, simple smile played about the corners of his wide mouth. Take his expression and his action together, and he was the maddest human spectacle imaginable. If Lehming and Nestoria had not been familiar with his oddities, they would have judged him stark crazy, and set about tying him. âI am frisky to-night,â he gasped breathlessly, as he curveted around the room. âWe must obey our whims, as well as our solemn intuitions, if we would be real men. Great and beautiful, and partakers of the divine essence, are the untrammelled children of nature. It is our rational duty to do what we want to do, like Robert Burns and George Gordon Byronâlike kittens and infants. If you desire to hop on one leg, let your desire have instant and unpremeditated outcome, defying the promenaders and the police. Skip, hop, and jump in Broadway, if Broadway seems your arena. Only do not hop through taking thought thereto, out of bravado or vain pomp. Let your hopping be the fruit of simplicity and honesty, or it is no acceptable hopping, but rather dishonoring.â Here he came in conflict with a chair, upsetting it and falling across it. Nestoria burst into a hearty, natural laugh, the first laugh that Lehming had ever heard from her, her only laugh since the night of the murder. Unabashed by his calamity, John Bowlder picked himself up, briskly set the chair on its clattering, noisy legs, placed himself astraddle of it, and commenced singing some of his own verses: âAll nature hath its clamorous joys; The hiding crickets make sharp noise, The fireman yawps, the rooster crows, The ploughman loudly blows his nose. âSing out, bawl out, the godlike glee Wherewith great Pan hath dowered thee, Which rings through Neptune's stormy reel And in the porker's festive squeal. âLet Brahm and Buddha swell the song, Let Dagon thunder it along, Let Woden shout his savage rune, And Bowlder answer with his tune.' âDo you call it a tune, Mr. Bowlder?â asked Nestoria, as soon as she could speak. âIt seems as though it must be something else.â Her face had a gleam of that shrewd, infantile humor which those who knew her months before had sometimes seen upon it. Lehming, to whom the expression was a revelation, gazed upon it with wonder and pleasure. He beheld in it the renewed hope and exhilaration of a soul which, after long wandering in utterly blinding darkness, finds its way into a more supportable gloom, and walks on with reviving confidence and cheerfulness. âYes, I venture to call that yawp a tune, Miss Nettie,â gayly replied the philosopher. âIt is the tune the old cow died of. It is Bowlder's tune, the only one he knows, and known to no other cosmos. The man who feels that he is called to sing cannot wait to learn music. If he is a true man, he will sing what he can, though the jackass keep him company. Suppose Robert Burns had refused to write poetry until he could write it in pure English or in Latin. We should not have had his great, boyish, demigod glee. There would have been no `Tam o' Shanter' for us, now nor forevermore. No Burns am I; no Tam o' Shanter have I to cheer the world with; so much I know of myself. But what I have that give I freely, like a bird, or a running spring, or a pumpkin pie.â This last figure struck him as a particularly good one. It was natural, it was drawn from common life, like the similes of Socrates and Emerson. It inspired him to improvise some more of his extraordinary poetry, singing it to his invariable melody, which went equally well with all meters: âLike a pumpkin pie Is this essor named I, Free to every eater, Would it were sweeter! But such as it is, the gods mixed it, And what there is of it, the universal forces fixed it; And although it is thin and plain, You may cut and come again. âThe old cow that died of the tune may now die again of the verses,â he commented with exterior modesty, while yet he could not help glancing about him in some faint hope of a compliment. Nestoria smiled. The first burst of resuscitated gayety was spent, and had not strength enough left to uplift her to a laugh. It seemed to her, nevertheless, that she was wildly merry. âI shall grow fat again if I go on laughing at this rate,â she said. âLet me urge you to laugh whenever you can,â counselled Lehming. âSome of us have too few chances for light-heartedness. We must let none slip.' âHe means himself as well as me,â thought Nestoria, glancing compassionately at his deformed figure and plaintive face. âI must give him what sympathy and comfort I can.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XL. INQUISITIONS AND ADMONITIONS. Now and then it seems as if the shallow materialists, who call themselves Spiritualists because they have revived fetishism and the superstition of savages, might yet be right in this one affirmation of theirs, that soul may communicate with soul through some medium other than the ordinary senses. What man so stolid and so isolated from his kind in heart, but that he has at times felt that some woman, who merely sat or stood near him, uttering no word and making no sign and sending him no glance, was yet kindly and warmly interested in him? An inaudible and invisible messenger has brought the tale, thrilling the delicate aspens of the affections with glad thankfulness, and perhaps even arousing the potent echoes of the blood. Nestoria granted to Lehming a silent throb of sympathy, and he knew it. It was a delicious moment: for a brief, happy while he forgot his ugliness; it appeared to him that he was worthy of loving, perhaps of being loved. A few tickings of the cheap wooden clock on his grimy mantelpiece measured out to him more of ecstasy than he had known in his whole life before. Then, little by little, the splendid glamour of extravagant hope faded, and his reason looked abroad once more upon its accustomed spectacle of a loveless life. He said to himself that it was folly to sit there gazing at Nestoria's fresh young beauty, and building for her and himself cloud-castles which could never be come realities. He would quit her at once, and seek sanity in the streets. It would be a wholesome self-sacrifice, honorable to his soul and of good augury for his future. âI shall leave you two to amuse each other,â he said, rising and putting on his Lilliputian overcoat. âI have an errand or two to attend to before bedtime.â âWhat a man does, that he has,â replied John Bowlder, quoting from his demigod Emerson. âNevertheless, as I care not for having, I give myself little to doing. I want no ownership in errands. I can subsist without such property. We do not spend half time enough in looking lazily into our own hearts, as a boy stares at the crumblings and askings of the coals. Let me tell you, Walter, that your life is too busy. You would be a greater soul if you did less worldly work. You are over-useful to your fellow creatures. And Edward Wetherel is taking the same thorny road and travelling in the same barren circle. I met him to-day. The Briareus had all his spiritual arms full of projects. It would take an Argus to see all the trouble he is going to make for himself and others. He wants to cure the sickly, who ought to die; wants to feed the lazy and stupid, who ought to starve; wants to turn good day laborers into poor philosophers; wants to do an infinite deal of mischief.â Lehming could not help glancing at Nestoria. At the name of Edward she had suddenly leaned forward, and she was now looking steadily into the blaze of the fire, her face hidden between her hands. He trusted that she believed somewhat to the young man's advantage, but he could not be sure. âI think our cousin does well,â he observed aloud. âSo far as is visible to man, he is leading a noble life. I hope that you will not be permitted to turn him from the way he has taken.â âNothing will turn him,â said John Bowlder. âHe is a chip of the old gnarled Puritan oak. He is a Wetherel.â As Lehming moved toward the door he met Imogen Eleonore entering. âAh! is it pos-si-ble?â drawled the schoolma'am, glancing significantly from Walter to Nestoria, and putting into her tone more of the mustard of satire than was absolutely necessary to give a taste to her words, as people of light brains and incomplete cultivation are apt to do when spiteful. âCan Mr. Lehming persuade himself to leave such delightful company?â Within the last week or two Imogen Eleonore had undergone a change of heart, or at least of behavior, for the worse. When she first extended her gracious beams to the so-called Nettie Fulton, she had expected that that mysterious young person would revolve around herself, and add to the glory of the Jonesian system. In such a case she would have continued to shine upon the girl with all the heat and splendor of her melodramatic affection. But things had gone otherwise; the little protÃ©gÃ©e had become the planet; the sublime patron had dwindled into the satellite. Not only Mr. John Bowlder, who was a very queer stick anyhow, but also Mr. Walter Lehming, who had formerly been Miss Jones's particular friend (as she supposed), had fallen down bewitched before this small stranger, both being ready to wear their legs to stumps with running on her errands, and to talk to her by the hour for the wages of her rare and brief answers. It was certainly most irrational conduct, and a just mind did well to be angry at it. What was there in Nettie to admire but a pretty face, golden hair, a mystery of some perhaps undesirable sort, and a certain odd, unexpected cleverness, which after all was only occasional? Imogen Eleonore could see nothing more; and in herself she could see a great deal more. She was âintellected,â as she phrased it, and a remarkable âconversationist,â as she persisted in spelling it. Her mind was richly stored with matters both useful and sentimental; she could discourse of grammar and geography and arithmetic and history and astronomy; and as for the prose and poetry of the âNew York Spasmodic,â who could outquote her? Yet here were these two men âa-going onâ about this little Nettie! And Mr. Lehming especially! a man whom she had supposed to be âtalented!â a man who held the lofty position of âinstructor!â He was bowing down to that chit; yes, he was actually âsitting upâ with her. How ridiculous, particularly in a dwarf! Miss Jones was, in her own vigorous phrase, âreal mad about it;â she could not put up with such silly âcarrying-on;â she was real mad, and she didn't care who knew it. Even the dignity and puissance of a male Instructor could not prevent her from showing her grittiness in look, tone, and speech. But if she expected to sneer a retort out of Lehming, or to daunt him into uttering some sidelong apology for his absurd preferences, she was disappointed. He divined the poor schoolma'am's bitterness of heart and pitied her for it. âWalk in, Miss Jones,â he said with his gentlest smile. âWalk in, and join our friends, and pardon me for leaving you.â With these words he went his way; and we shall do best to follow him. He had not met Edward Wetherel since the evening when Nestoria's hints, or rather her silence, had seemed to clothe him in the garb of murder. He had not been able to muster the courage and the hardness to look him in the face. Now he was going to see him; to cross-examine his countenance and demeanor; to judge, if it were possible, whether he were guilty or not. He found the youthful millionaire, lately one of the most ostentatious of prodigals, living in a single plainly-furnished room, which served both as parlor and bedroom. The meeting between the pair was in one respect very remarkable. The inquisitor's eye wandered and his voice faltered, while the supposed culprit was as calm and brave as innocence ever is. âYou are economical,â said Lehming, seating himself in a hard, well-worn chair, and glancing about the somewhat dingy chamber. âI have wasted money enough in my time,â replied Edward. His manner in making this confession was admirable; it had none of that conceit with which reformed spendthrifts are apt to speak of their bygone extravagances; it expressed honest regret and self-reproach. âA man in your situation is exposed to two great temptations,â continued Lehming. âWealth is beckoned to by lavish pleasure on one side, and by avarice on the other.â âI am shielded from both for the present,â said Wetherel. âI consider myself the trustee of this estate, and not the owner. But even if I were really rich. I hope that I should not be a fool. My ideas of what is fine in life have changed. Of course the pendulum may swing back; I may become what I have been; but I trust not.â It seemed so clear that he meant even more than he saidâthere was such testimony of a profound renovation of character in his very calmness of utterance and demeanorâthat Lehming turned upon his devils of suspicions, and cast them out. âI do not wish you to be an ascetic,â he observed with the frank kindness of friendship. âAll extremes of conduct verge on irrationality. The extremist does evil as well as good. Calvin purified the church, but his preachings were too violent, and there has been a harmful reaction against them. Your well-meaning and pure-hearted uncle was in his way a Calvin. He did you little good while he lived.â âIt was hard to do good to such a jackanapes as I was,â said Wetherel. âDo you know that a few months ago I was a prodigious ass? It is enough to make one both laugh and cry to think of it. When I was actually in a state of insolvency, I bought myself a two-hundred-dollar dressing-gown. I was such an amazing jackanapes that I thought it a fine thing to wear a velvet and brocade dressing-gown. I received my friends in it when they came to lend me money to pay my board bills.â Lehming smiled, for he believed in his relative's innocence of crime, and the credence made him light-hearted. âI used to attribute your profuseness to the influence of Wolverton,â he remarked. âWolverton was not a model,â assented Wetherel. âBut I never knew him to be quite so bereft of common sense as myself. There was some judgment in the man, and it helped him to some morality.â Here, by one of those coincidences which seem so frequent and so striking to the imagination, the person who was the subject of conversation made his appearance. There was a rap, and before Wetherel could fairly say, âCome in,â Wolverton entered. âUnceremonious,â he observed in his easy, assured, pleasant way. âBut I have something which I consider devilish important to lay before you two gentlemen,â he went on with an earnestness unusual in him, he being commonly a talker of the elegantly languid type. âCame to see Wetherel about it, but glad to find you both here. Don't you care anything about your relative, Miss Dinneford? I do; not that I have the honor to know her much, but I hate to see a nice girl in danger of coming to griefâthat is, when she's connected with a friend of mine,â he added, quite unconscious of the horrible cynicism of his qualification. âAnd come to grief she certainly will, if she marries that dâd Poloski. I've found out something about the man more than we knew, Wetherel. I fell in with a detective, a low sort of blockhead named Sweet, who wanted to pump me about theâthe Wetherel affair, you know. Well, Sweet casually mentioned Poloski, and as I hate Poloski I asked what he knew of him, and he told me a doose of a story. He says the noble foreigner is certainly an adventurerâwell, we supposed as much, I take itâ that's not new. But he went on to say that he gets his living in all sorts of queer waysânot only by poker, as we are experimentally aware, but by other means lessâgenteel. That is, so Sweet thinks, and thinks he can prove. He has his eye on him; has traced him after midnight to Riley's saloon; horrid bad place, if you know it. Of course Poloski might claim that he was there to study character and idioms. But Sweet followed him in, and found that he had gone up stairs alone with Riley, and also that he had the name of courting Riley's daughterâpretty little wild girl, Sweet said. The fellows there chaffed her about the Count, and she bridled and giggled and all that sort of thing. That was about all the man had to tell me. But don't you see that the thing looks dark? Of course I hate Poloski; he is something of a rival of mine in two or three places; I hate him a little, and despise him more, and so forth. But prejudice aside, I claim that his case looks dark. And in my opinionâ begging your pardon for interfering in a family matterâyou two fellows ought to look after him. Just imagine this girlâexcuse me, I mean Miss Dinnefordâjust imagine her married to Poloski. The next thing you would hear would be that she was abandoned, perhaps in Europe or the Lord knows where, and coming to grief all by herself. Don't you think so yourself now, Wetherel?â Edward's only reply was to rise from his chair with a mien of indignant excitement, such as the defunct Judge Wetherel might have worn in the sterner agitations of his youth, and such as we might perhaps fairly impute to many previous Wetherels. Wolverton rose also, and walked to the door. âDon't let me detain you,â he added as he went out. âThe quicker you put your oar in, the better. He might pop any day, and put things beyond curing.â In a minute more Wetherel and Lehming were on their way toward the Dinneford house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLI. PEDANTIC LOVE-MAKING. How came it about that such a grotesque and dubious adventurer as Poloski should win, to a certain extent at least, the confidence of such a sensible mother in Israel as Mrs. Dinneford, and the liking of such a flirtish daughter of Zion as Alice? It was probably the title of Count which mainly did the business for these two ladies, as well as for a number of other ladies then breathing the air of freedom in this glorious republic, the land of democratic simplicity and equality. After our best society had decided to concede and eventually to affirm that Poloski was an entirely authentic noble, his success as a man of fashion and as a beau was assured. Even to the minds of free men and free women there is something powerfully and we will not say irrationally dazzling in the fact of descent from âa hundred earls,â or even from a much shorter string of titled forefathers. As we look upon a âscion of a noble stock,â we get an impression of the virtues and potencies and great deeds of successive eminent generations, all accumulated and concentrated in the perhaps personally unattractive individual before us, and shining out of him like the vitality of bygone forests out of a lump of anthracite. It seems natural and right to how down to a Lama whose lamaic predecessors have mayhap looked upon the crouchings of our predecessors. We are good republicans in our heads; we can argue against caste in the abstract, and do not want its hands in our pockets; but our imaginations are enchanted by it. So Count Poloski was a favorite in stylish New York society; a dozen, or perhaps twenty, or perhaps forty of our young ladies were more or less bewitched about him; and Alice Dinneford had not been able to resist the widespread infection. Satirical, clever, and in some respects sensible, she was in many things the abject slave of public opinion, and she wanted to carry off this prize which so many others strove for. And, what is much more wonderful, her mother had come to grant the Pole a certain degree of regard. The fact that âFreedom shrieked when Kosciusko fellâ pleaded eloquently for him to Mrs. Dinneford's excellent heart. Likewise it advantaged him much with her that he was such a âscholarly man,â and knew so much, or so little, of so many languages, and could talk fluently of so many diverse, abstruse subjects. An intellectual charlatan, whose hasty cleverness had washed through numerous channels and brought away some golden or at least shining sands, was naturally impressive to a semi-educated spirit which had the New England reverence for learning and looked upon every college tutor as a precious well-spring of knowledge. And when Mrs. Dinneford found that Poloski could discourse copiously concerning the Scriptures, she became disposed to consider him an elect soul, who might properly be received into any of the households of our American Zion. His views of Jewish history, indeed, rather amazed her; he discussed that revered subject with an absence of prejudice which at times seemed to her to border on free-thinking; but the fact that a foreigner, and especially a noble foreigner, should know anything at all about the Bible was delightful; and on the whole she listened to the Count's doubts and queries with a patience not devoid of respect and admiration. This very evening, while Edward Wetherel and Lehming were coming to dislodge Poloski from her confidence, she held with him earnest speech concerning the influence of the captivity in purifying and elevating the Hebrew religion. The family scene was a pleasant one to look at. The tall, blonde, handsome, dandified Poloski talked from the sofa, or rose in moments of inspiration to pace once or twice across the room, gesturing meanwhile with taking vivacity. Mrs. Dinneford hearkened from her rocking-chair, her plain but kindly and bright face beaming with interest, and her large, strongly-veined hands busy upon some charitable needlework. Alice, curled up prettily on a cushion, embroidered with a sort of tremulous vehemence quite characteristic of her when debarred from talking. âIn short, Mrs. Dinneford, the captivity founded Hebraism,â summed up the encyclopedical Count. âThe captivity was the starting-point of the Jewish national faith, as we know it. Up to the captivity the Hebrews had no national faith. The school of the prophets, which was a patriotic sect, worshipped the Baal or Lord of Israel, who, as German scholars have discovered was a sun-god. The other Jews worshipped Moloch, who was the sun-god of the Tyrians, and the bacchic Baal, who was a sun-god of the northern Canaanites, and Ashtaroth, who was the moon-goddess of the Sidonians, and other pantheonic deities. Their great king Solomon built temples to all the divinities of the surrounding peoples. The nation was polytheistic through all its early history. It knew nothing of the great truth of monotheism. Superficial scholars, such as you have in England and America, have stigmatized the son of Nebat as an idolater. He was not; he was a reformer; he was a foe of polytheism. He set up the golden calf, or bull, as the symbol of the sun-god of Israel. He did away with other deities. He was the founder of a national faith, purer far than the faith of Solomon. But his struggle to establish monotheism was unsuccessful. Not until the captivity, not until the advent of the Persic idea of a divine unity, did the Jews become monotheists. We owe Hebraic monotheism to the Persians, a race of the noble Aryan stock. That, Mrs. Dinneford, is the true history of monotheism, at least so far as it concerns the Hebrews.â âThese things are too hard for me, Mr. Poloski,â replied the good lady, shaking her orthodox head resolutely, but with less acrimony than might have been expected. âI know that in the times of Elijah there were only seven thousand that had not bowed the knee to Baal and kissed him. But that was because Ahab and Jezebel had led the nation into apostasy. We have it in the Scriptures that the Jews were God's chosen people.â âMy dear Mrs. Dinneford, all peoples are God's chosen peoples,â urged the Count. âHe made them all; he chose to make them all; they are all his chosen peoples.â âI must think of these matters,â said Mrs. Dinneford, still shaking her head. âAnother time, when I have meditated more fully on these weighty questions, I shall be glad to discuss them with you. I don't suppose that we shall settle them,â she laughed good-humoredly. âAs Tupper says, Shall time teach the lesson which eternity cannot master? I know that there are difficulties in Hebrew history. But my faith stands firm. With Tupper, again, I can declare. It is written, and so we believe, waiting not for outward proof. To be sure, he speaks there of the Trinity; but the same good rule applies to other mysteries; whatever is written I accept.â The Count bowed, lifted his shoulders slightly, and fell silent. Perhaps he saw that it was useless to argue with this believing lady; perhaps he feared that he had already argued too boldly for his own good. Conceited as he was, and fond beyond measure of the sound of his own voice, he had nevertheless some worldly wisdom of self-control, and he did not want to win the ill opinion of Alice's mother. By the way, how is it possible, in view of the theories which Poloski had advanced, that Mrs. Dinneford had not set him down as an outright infidel, and resolved to eschew his company? Well, in the first place, he was a Count; and that was a fact which still confounded her greatly; she did not quite know what a Count ought to believe. In the second place, she was largely broad-church in her sentiments; orthodox as she was for herself, she was very charitable to the views of others; and if a man admitted the existence of a Creator, she strove to be content with him. In the third placeâand this was the most bewildering fact of allâPoloski admired Alice. In a person who beheld good in her child, this affectionate mother could find little evil. âI doubt not you will convict me when we talk again, Mrs. Dinneford,â bowed and smiled the Count, âIn fact, we differ little in our opinions at bottom. All my ancestors have been Christians, and have derived their faith from the Hebrews. I could not turn my back upon the belief of my ancestors.â âIt is a great blessing to come of a devout family,â observed Mrs. Dinneford, who trusted that she had derived some good from her Wetherel descent. âVirtue and credence are hereditary,â pursued the Count. âThat is one argument in favor of the belief in a special chosen people.â âYou are a philosopher, Mr. Poloski,â said the lady, quite cheered and gratified by this suggestion. âI do so reverence a philosophical mind, even when led away by too much trusting to its own strength, as is the case, I fear, with our great Emerson. You remind me of my cousin, John Bowlder, who is an Emersonian, or tries his best to be.â âBowlder!â grimaced Poloski, not much pleased with the comparison. âYou must pardon me for saying what I think of Bowlder. He is an idealogue without a system. I have no confidence in idealogues who have no system, but say everything they can think of, burly hurly.â Mrs. Dinneford burst into a hearty laugh; her sense of humor was easily tickled. âCousin John is tangled,â she admitted. âHis talk is much like throwing things out of a window in a fire, grappling first whatever comes handiest, and tumbling everything in one pile. To listen to him is just about the same as reading a dictionary: Deuteronomy, and deviltry, and duty, and dishwater come in the same column. But Cousin John, notwithstanding his queer mixtures, and his poor, futile free-thinking, has such goodness of heartâ â âOh, I love goodness of heart,â hastily interjected Poloski, fearing lest he had been too hard upon Cousin Bowlder. âGoodness of heart makes amends for everything,â he added, kissing his fingers and waving them heavenward. Alice cringed under this absurdly flat speech, and said to herself that now and then the Count was too silly, and for a moment marvelled over the fact that she had ceased to laugh at him. Then she reflected that he had improved of late; that, for one thing, he had dropped his ridiculous investigations into âslangsâ; and finally that other girls as well as herself had learned to admire him. Nevertheless, she was anxious to give such a turn to the conversation as might prevent him from throwing any more kisses to goodness of heart. So she asked him (and a most insidious question it was) whether he intended to pass his life in America. âI must go to Poland this very winter,â returned Poloski, with the start of a man who suddenly remembers urgent affairs. âWhy so?â asked Alice, conscious of a sharp pang of interest. âYou are not going to fire the Polish heart and make a revolution, I hope?â she added, trying to varnish over her anxiety with a joke. âI would if I could,â declared the Count tragically. âBut no; impossible. The Russian and German colossuses are too big and strong. The emancipation of the serfs in Russia has thrown all into confusion in all Slavic countries. My steward knows not how to manage free tenants, and my revenues have diminished twenty thousand dollars, which,â he added after a moment of computationââwhich is almost half. I must go there and restore order. I must be my own Suwarrow. A steward cannot do it.â Mrs. Dinneford was delighted to see him take his loss of income so calmly, thinking that he had indeed inherited a heroic and worthy spirit from his noble ancestors. âI trust you will be gentle with your poor tenants, who of course don't know how to use their freedom aright the moment they get it, and must learn by degrees how to perform their duties toward their employer, as well as toward themselves,â she said with a simple good faith which might have drawn tears from an honestly tender philanthropist, but which only tempted Poloski to smile. âI shall be considerate to them, I assure you, my excellent Mrs. Dinneford,â he promised with the gracious grandeur of an Ahasuerus extending his sceptre. âHere in America I have made advances in the sublime science of humanity.â This speech was a hit, for Mrs. Dinneford had been an abolitionist from her youth up, and had rejoiced exceedingly in emancipation and negro suffrage, and sympathized with Mr. Sumner's desire to give every colored brother a farm and mule. Poloski saw that he had produced a good impression, and it occurred to him that he ought to improve it at once. There was Miss Dinneford, a prize worth having. She was genteel, and she was handsome, and, what was more, she was rich, or would be. He must marry her; but to bring that about he must propose to her; and how should he propose? Would it be best to declare his love to the daughter after the American fashion, or preliminarily to the mother, after the fashion of Europe? Should he ask a private interview with Mrs. Dinneford or with Alice? For a few seconds he was silent, gravely debating these breathless questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLII. THE PLAIN DEALING OF TRUE FRIENDS. COUNT POLOSKI had just decided that he would put his covetousness of Miss Dinneford's money into such affectionate and love-making English as he could command, and fire it off at both mother and daughter together, in the reasonable hope of bringing down at least one of them, when the door bell checked him with its intrusive, unsympathetic tinkle, and in walked Edward Wetherel and Lehming. It will be remembered that they believed him to be a perilous adventurer, if not a vulgar ruffian, and that they came to exorcise him out of this household. But there was no violence, and even no outright, candid explanation, so forbearing are the manners of American society, at least in the North, and so little pugnacious is its very hostility. Wetherel and Lehming were young men of the modern Puritan type, resolute and tenacious enough at heart, but outwardly composed and mild. During the walk hitherward they had talked over their errand in a tranquil, business-like, considerate fashion, and had said that while the Count must if possible be got rid of, the feelings of the Dinnefords must be handled delicately. So they bowed to Poloski, and took his hand when he put it forth in his vivacious, genial way, and otherwise treated him decorously. Of course he was exceedingly conciliatory to the relatives of Alice; he addressed Edward as âMy dear Wetherel,â and called Lehming âMon savant.â âI did not see you the other evening at the Van Leers,â he remarked to Edward. âThey gave a splendid soirÃ©e, the Van Leers. Mrs. Van Leer was very gracious to me; she always is gracious. I admire Mrs. Van Leer, she is so gracious and spiritual. She is no longer quite young, but she is excessively delicious, she is so gracious. I was very sorry not to see you there, my dear Wetherel. I always miss you. And I missed you, too, Mrs. Dinneford and Miss Dinneford. I had very little pleasure there, because I did not see any of you.â âWe were not invited,â answered Mrs. Dinneford with self-respectful frankness, while Alice colored deeply, and barely refrained from biting her lips with vexation; for the Van Leers were what she called âawfully fashionable,â and the fact that they had overlooked her was mortifying. Let us remember, by the way, that it was mainly because the Count âwent everywhereâ that he seemed so desirable in her eyes. If she should become the Countess Poloski, she too would be able to âgo everywhere,â certainly in New York and probably in Europe. âOh, I am sure there was an invitation, but it did not arrive,â replied the ready Poloski. âThe Van Leers have often spoken to me of Mrs. and Miss Dinneford with distinguished consideration,â he continued, romancing with admirable volubility. âThey must have invited you, they are so gracious. Did you not receive your invitation, my dear Wetherel?â âYes,â admitted Edward unwillingly, for he detected Alice's mortification, and was sorry to increase it by publishing his own superior fashionableness. âBut I seldom go out of late. These crushes are uninteresting to me.â âYou forget that Mr. Wetherel has suffered a bereavement lately,â whispered Mrs. Dinneford to Poloski. âAhâyes,â murmured the Count with an air of extreme confusion, quite remarkable in such a veteran of society. He seemed to be painfully overwhelmed by his blunder, and sank into silence. Alice discerned his embarrassment, and was affectionately minded to come to his relief, and did so with all a woman's vivacity and fluency, giving forth corruscations of her thin, sparkling prattle. But somehow the noble foreigner's extinguished taper could not be relighted, and after grinning and bowing and saying âOh yesâ a few times, he took a flourishing departure. As soon as he had vanished, Alice became taciturn and moody. She had an impression that somehow her two relatives had driven the Count away, and she almost hated them for it. What young lady had he gone to see now, and what would he say to her, and what would she reply, and what would he say then, and what would be the result? were the important questions which perturbed her soul and darkened her brow. She did not seem the same girl that she had been during Poloski's visit. She was not merely speechless and sober; she had suddenly turned a little haggard and pale. âYou appear to be unwell, Alice,â observed Lehming, always promptly sympathetic. âI am not well,â she said, rising in a state of uncontrollable nervousness, so that the tears almost came into her eyes. âI wish you two would excuse me for going to bed. I have a horrid headache. You can talk to mother, or rather you can listen to her,â she added, forcing a gleam of her natural gayety. âShe will be so glad to get me off and have all the say to herself! Good-night.â âGood-night,â answered the young men, gazing after her pitifully, for they were going to do a hard duty by her, and they were sensitive enough to know it. Alice gone, Edward took a seat by Mrs. Dinneford, and began: âMy dear aunt, we have come to speak of this very man whom we found here, Mr. Poloski.â Then he told her, without alluding to Alice's supposed heart affairs, what Wolverton had reported to him of the Count's evil repute and suspicious ways. Before he had finished his story the good woman's eyes were full of anxiety. âOh dear!â she groaned. âWhat a world of snares and of pitfalls for the feet we live in! It is the Valley of the Shadow of Death. The slough is on the right hand and the black, miry ditch on the left, and devils roaming up and down the footway.â âUntil this man clears himself of these charges, and shows that he is a person of reputable life, he is not fit to enter your house,â continued Wetherel. âNo,â sighed Mrs. Dinneford, and came to a full stop there. She did not much doubt the tale; she was accustomed to rely upon the judgment of both Edward and Walter; they were not men to bring railing accusations against any one unadvisedly. But what was she to do, or rather what would she be able to do, in this matter? Alice was a true woman; in an affair which concerned her sentiments, she was almost ungovernable; what she wanted with her heart, she wanted with all her mind and strength. Moreover, there had been little government in the family since the death of its male head. Mrs. Dinneford had been like most American mothers, and like most mothers of only children everywhere; she was a good woman, conscientious and intelligent, but utterly incapable of holding strict rule over her offspring. If there had been any domestic lawgiving, any wielding of a family sceptre, it had been mainly on the part of Alice. The affectionate mother actually cringed before the idea of a conflict with the petted daughter. âMr. Wolverton himself isâisââ she presently stammered. âAre you sure that we can trust what he says?â âI know that Poloski is a gambler,â replied Edward firmly. âIn other times he has won hundreds of dollars from me.â âThe wages of sin!â shuddered Mrs. Dinneford. âGambling alone is not enough to ostracize him from society,â continued the fair-minded young man. âIn Europe gentlemen and respectable people gamble; fathers and children win each other's francs or shillings. But Poloski has lived by cards. He makes gambling a profession. He has no other visible means of existence. Moreover, I suspect him of being an impostor, and perhaps worse. I give credit to all that Wolverton reports and hints, excepting the mere point of actual crime, violation of the laws. I do not know that the man belongs to the criminal classes. That I must admit.â âOh, mysteries of wickedness!â sighed Mrs. Dinneford, her troubled eyes fixed upon the carpet without seeing it. âWhat will you do?â asked Wetherel after a pause. âIt is Alice!â confessed the wretched mother in a sort of choked cry. âI must tell you the whole of this wretched business. Alice is bewitched about this man. Ever so many other girls are. I have never quite liked him, but I have put up with him for her sake. I have feared some evil, and have fought, in my poor, unfaithful way, against it, and have prayed for help. But my child has been stubborn, and God has not aided. What can a mother do against her only daughter, and against her own foolish heart? I fear that we shall both be terribly chastised. A just God will not spare such unfaithfulness.â âI trust that there is as yet no understandingâno engagement,â put in Lehming. âOh no!â gasped the mother, not quite sure of it. âAnd you will see that none takes place?â begged Wetherel. âI willâstrive,â stammered Mrs. Dinneford, nearly weeping with the fear that her strivings might be futile against the will of her child. âOh, we ought to have spoken before,â groaned Edward, perceiving the mother's weakness, and anticipating the worst from it. âMy only excuse is that I have been so terribly occupied with my own wretched affairs I have forgotten my relatives. But do be urgent with Alice! And if your remonstrances are of no avail, call us in to plead with her. She does not and cannot realize how miserable she might be if she should marry a reckless, characterless adventurer, a man without standing or morals. The dissipation of all her property would be the least of her troubles. He might lead her such a life of domestic wretchedness as she cannot imagine. He might abandon her penniless in some distant country. Such things have been. American girls have caught sham nobles, and even real ones, to their own sorrow.â He spoke with an earnestness and faithfulness which seemed little less than cruel. Mrs. Dinneford, as she looked at him through her tears, thought of his resolute and stern uncle, and of all the grim Wetherels of elder days. âBe of good cheer,â smiled Lehming pitifully, as he and Edward took their departure. âI cannot believe that the Almighty Father in whom you have trusted will refuse you guidance and strength. If you want human help, send for us immediately. I shall be here again to-morrow, and every day.â âGod bless you. Walterâand you too, Edward!â called Mrs. Dinneford from the doorstep. A hulking, gorilla-browed man, in a shaggy white overcoat, looked up with a yellow grin, and a tawdry, painted, consumptive girl burst into a hoarse giggle. Regardless of these two denizens of a world which was not hers, or rather so wrapt and blindly encumbered with her trouble of mind that she could not really see them, Mrs. Dinneford closed the door and went slowly up stairs to enter into conflict with the being whom she loved best in all the world. âIt would seem,â she piteously thought, âas if it were always true that our foes shall be they of our own household.â Alice, notwithstanding her alleged headache, had not gone to bed. She sat in a little rocking-chair, tossing one foot and biting her lips, half moping and half petulant. She was the picture of a girl who wants her will, who fears that she may not get it, who fears that it may hurt her, and who still wants it. If ever a woman is stubborn and indifferent to consequences, and careless of right and wrong, it is in a love affair. It may be fairly doubted of many, or even of most women, whether in such matters they exercise either judgment or conscience. They will lie, they will deceive their parents, they will commit petty meannesses, and all this without any pungent shame or sense of guilt. The very next Sunday they are at church with demure faces, and remain to communion. We are furious at their hypocrisy until we turn to study the lives of their brothers. Then, without a further doubt or growl, we concede the purity of womanhood. âWhat did they talk about?â asked Alice peevishly, as if suspicious that the conversation below had not been such as to please her. âThey spoke of Mr. Poloski,â answered the mother, in a tone which confessed that the speaking had not been to that person's advantage. Alice uttered an indistinct, sulky, anxious sound, which was not loud enough to be called an exclamation, and which decorum forbids us from describing as a grunt. She knew that something evil was to be said of her Count, and she did not want to hear it, and she was crazy to dispute it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLIII. A SPARED ROD AND A SPOILED CHILD. Before Alice could recover her power of speech Mrs. Dinneford was able to tell her all the vague evil which Edward had charged against Poloski, and to add, in a voice of touching appeal, âOh, my dear child, do send him away!â Then was exhibited all the unregenerate and little less than unholy passion of which a nominally good girl, âa member of the church in full and regular standing,â can be capable when she is determined on a lover, and is forbidden to have him. Alice cried, but not meekly and sweetly; she cried in a rage, striking her feet on the floor and complaining loudly, and even scolding; it was a grief as unlovely as that of a child who wails and screams and snatches for cake. A man who had only seen this young lady in society, gracious and graceful and entertaining and smiling, would not have known her now for the same person. Her eyes were red and flashing; the tears flowed copiously down her cheeks and spotted her dress; her face was swollen and flushed, and her expression unpleasantly eager and wilful; she had gestures which were eloquent certainly, but not agreeable to look upon. The truth is that Alice, good-hearted as she was by nature, had been nearly spoiled by indulgence. Like many another âsweet girlâ of our times, she had grown up in the belief that life ought to be one everlasting picnic, at least for young ladies. She felt herself wronged, and believed that she had a right to be angry, when she was not amused from morning to night. Self-denial she had none, nor any ennobling longing after labor and duty, but only a desire to âhave a good time.â At last this sybarite of American democracy, this luxurious child of a society which requires all play and no work of woman, was faced by a denial and threatened by a disappointment, all for her own good. She could not endure such unaccustomed hardness; she was in an agony of grief and in a spasm of rage. âWhat stuff for Edward to talk!â she argued, as women and other people in close quarters will do, evading the real point at issue. âWhat was Edward himself a little while ago? He was just as wild and dissipated as anybody. He is a pretty man to bring up stories against other people! Why didn't he say this to Count Poloski's face? He didn't dare to. He was afraid there would be an easy explanation to all this nonsense. He was afraid he might get his charges back in his own face, hot and heavy. What if Count Poloski was seen in a low drinking-saloon? In the first place, I don't believe it. I don't believe that low man, Sweetâa mean, crawling spy and detective! And then what if he was there? Didn't Charles Dickens go to all the vile places in this city to study character, and in London too? Count Poloski is a foreigner. He wants of course to see our criminal classes. It's as likely as not he is writing a book about America. And then he is a stranger here, and I dare say he doesn't know every horrid hole in New York, like that wretched Sweet, and sometimes goes where he wouldn't if he did know. I am perfectly astonished at Edward. I didn't think he was so uncharitable and ungenerous and meanâoh, mean, meanâmean as dirt! Before I would do such a thing as this!âblacken my friend's character behind his back!âfor he has been his friend. Oh, I hate men! I hate 'em and despise 'em! They are all mean, and I don't believe a word they say! and oh, I wish I was dead and in my grave!â Here came a fresh burst of tears, with sobbings and twitchings of the mouth, and angry stampings and gestures. Mrs. Dinneford listened and stared in severe silence. For a brief space this fond and over-indulgent mother was revolted by her daughter. She gazed at the girl with an eye which told of illusions lost, at least for the moment, and which sparkled forth contempt and indignation as well as sorrow. It would have been a relief to her sense of justice and to her feelings to take this silly young person by the arm and give her a sound shaking. But Mrs. Dinneford was very clever; it is probable that early and thorough culture might have developed her into a woman of decided brilliancy; and even with her limited educational and social advantages, she had at times flashes of intelligence which were near akin to genius. On the present occasion, remembering some follies of her own immature years, and perhaps also the headlong pranks of school-girl companions, she turned from the individual to the sex. The judgment which she uttered was large enough to be sublime and severe enough to be terrible. âI do believe,â she said slowly and sadly, âthat no woman ever let her God stand between herself and the man she wanted.â âOh! what do you say that for?â Alice almost screamed, for she had a conscience under her wilfulness, and it stung her wofully at this instant. âThere have been exceptions,â continued the mother. âBut you, my child, are not one of them.â Alice slipped out of her ehair upon the floor, and grovelled there in a paroxysm of humiliation. âOh! you have turned against me,â she whimpered. âYou are all against me, you and Edward and Walter. I haven't a friend in my family. If ever I want to do anything, you all want to stop me, just for the sake of stopping me, and go to calling me sinful, and silly, and everything else that's horrid. I am the most snubbed and governed and bullied girl that ever lived. Nobody wants me to be happy, and everybody wants me to be wretched.â âAlice, stop! And get up!â commanded the mother, still keeping her senses, in spite of this piteous wail. But the girl would not rise until she had conquered. She had one last resource, a reserve which had given her more than one victory, and she now brought it into action. She went off in a sobbing, shrieking, jerking fit of hysterics. Mrs. Dinneford ought either to have left her, or to have emptied a pitcher of water over her. Nobody ever indulges in hysterics alone, and no young lady will lie still and let a favorite silk dress be spoiled. But Mrs. Dinneford was at bottom soft-hearted, and moreover she was economical. She pitied her convulsed child, she spared the lilac silk and lace-edgings, and she lost the battle. In a minute they were both weeping together, and the daughter cried to better purpose than the parent. In a contest for mastery between two people who love each other, the victory generally rests with the one who loves least. By the time that Alice had been lifted from the carpet and laid gently on her bed and soothed with hartshorn and caresses, she had recovered her supremacy over the doting creature who nursed her. âMamma, don't break my heart!â she sobbed, with her arms around her mother's neck. âOh, no! I must let you break it yourself, and break mine,â wept Mrs. Dinneford, feeling that she was beaten and giving up the struggle in despair. âNo, no! He is better than you believe,â insisted Alice. âAt all events my fate is fixed,â she continued in a high-flying, sentimental tone which expressed romantic egotism and self-worship at least as much as affection. âThis man must have me if he wants me. My heart must not be balked except by him.â âOh, my child! does he really love you?â asked the unhappy mother, catching at straws for comfort. âIf he does; that may save all, even if he is not good.â âHe has pressed my hand,â whispered the silly girl, for whom we must surely feel a profound commiseration, as well as a wholesome, wrathful desire to slap her. âAnd, O mamma, I was so happy! I am sure he will be good when he sees how happy it makes me to have him good.â âGod's will be done!â assented Mrs. Dinneford, sinking back from the bed upon her knees. Then, feeling that it was not God's will which was to be done, but something very different from that, she added, âGod have mercy upon us!â âOh, mamma, thank you!â whispered Alice, selfishly alert and prompt to seize upon this hardly-wrung concession. She put out her hands, drew her mother's throbbing head to her, and kissed it repeatedly. It was a touching scene, and to one who did not know the folly which had ruled it and the wretched outlook which it had into the future, it would have seemed a beautiful one. It ended when Mrs. Dinneford started abruptly from her knees and went to her room to fall upon them anew and alone. Alice had now brought her mother to accept this betrothal; and more than that, she had brought herself to accept it. It is a curious fact, and indicative of the dark ways of the feminine soul (not to enter upon the oddities of the masculine ditto), that up to this time she had not been able to decide whether she wanted Poloski or not. She was fascinated by him, and yet she was a good deal afraid that he might make a bad husband, and between these conflicting sentiments she had seesawed. Opposition had determined her; the moment the man was forbidden fruit she longed for him; in the struggle to have her will she had worked herself into a belief that she ardently loved him; and perhaps there was as much affection in the flurry as there is in most of those spasms of the inwards which lead to nuptials. When Poloski made his next call, which happened on the morning following, it was delicately borne in upon him that a hand would be his for the asking. Women have numerous indescribable ways of imparting such information, while preserving an air of heavenly guilelessness and freedom from earthly motives, as if they no more thought of marrying than the angels. The man who picks up what is laid fairly and squarely under his nose, is nevertheless left under the impression that he discovered it all by himself and with great difficulty. It is like giving a mouse to a kitten; tommy invariably supposes that he caught it. There are indeed male souls so timid or stupid that they cannot see their good luck with sufficient clearness to lay a paw upon it. We have read of a lover who shot himself, in despair of winning his Dulcinea, on the very day that she drowned herself because he could not be coaxed to propose. But Count Poloski was not a suitor of this humble and unhopeful stripe. When the mouse was pitched under his whiskers he alighted upon it with beautiful promptness and dexterity. We cannot say what Alice did; perhaps she incidentally gave him a flower; perhaps she accidentally touched his hand; perhaps she only gazed meekly into his eyes. But in the next second the Count had her by the trembling fingers, and was pouring his tale of exotic love into her simple Yankee ears. In the next minute she had cried, and had laid her hot, wet face on his noble shoulder, and had whispered a frightened, happy âYes,â and in short was a âgone goose.â Poor little feminine republican! She did not really admire the man; she more or less thought him a jackanapes, and perhaps a bad fellow; but her democratic soul was entangled and laid helpless in the meshes of a title. How many daughters of freedom, not to dilate upon a âsmart sprinklingâ of fathers and mothers to the same, have gone and done likewise! One wonders whether the time will ever come when our countrymen will be able to say with unshakable pride, feeling that there is no loftier boast on earth, âI am an American citizen!â Probably not while our politics remain in their present demagogical chaos. If bosses continue to rule our cities, and old war-horses to neigh brutish stupidities in our Congress, it will be well if the entire nation does not follow the example of Alice Dinneford, prostrating itself before some Poloski and saying, âRule thou over us.â When poor Mrs. Dinneford was informed of the betrothal, she could say nothing cheerful to her daughter or her prospective son-in-law. She kissed Alice with convulsive affection, and endured Poloski's kiss without returning it. During the greater part of the day she remained in her room weeping, reading the Bible, and praying. Tupper was no comfort; even Bunyan failed to lift her the least bit out of her Slough of Despond; she could cling to nothing but the âPromises.â But grieved as she was, she made no further fight; once more her child had altogether triumphed over her; the sorrowful woman, to use her own forcible phrase, âhad given up.â When Edward called in the afternoon she wrote on a card, âAlice is engagedâI cannot talk of it,â and so sent him away unseen. A similar missive met Lehming, and got rid of him likewise. Nor would Alice see her cousins; she was furious at them still for maligning her Poloski; she did not mean to forgive them unless they came to her wedding. Perhaps, too, she kept her room out of a vague fear lest these cruel men had found some new accusation against her Count which would come hard upon forcing her to dimiss him. We must leave her to her selected destiny, premising that it will not be a wellspring of pleasure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLIV. A PROSPECTIVE COUNTESS. Mrs. Dinneford was at first greatly amazed, as well as terrified and grieved, by the result of Alice's flirtations. She was as much astonished to find herself the prospective mother-in-law of a dandified, grimacing, philological foreign Count as a sober hen might be at discovering that she had hatched a hook-nosed, flame-colored, jabbering macaw. It was really pitiful to see the eager, ruffled, clucking way in which she watched his struttings and gasconadings, as if she were wondering what noise this outlandish bird would make next, and fearing lest he should peck the coop to pieces. Little by little, however, she became somewhat numb to the situation, and even learned to treat her daughter's betrothed with a certain exterior cordiality, smiling much at him in a mechanical, placating way, and, so to speak, dumbly interceding with him not to be as bad as he could be. He on his part saw that virtue was desired of him, and did his best to inspire hope that it would be forthcoming. To hear him talk about himself was like listening to a fairy-tale about the âgood prince.â According to his telling, he was one of the finest fellows morally that you could set your mind's eye upon. He had never done a dishonorable thing; that was a point on which he frequently and copiously insisted; nothing unworthy of a gentleman! nothing unworthy of his ancestors! nothing ignoble! And then he was so rich; he had such enormous and little less than immeasurable territories! such hosts, and ever increasing hosts, too, of tenants! The most remarkable thing about his estate, indeed, was the facility with which it committed annexation and doubled its population. The expansion of the United States and the increase of the children of Israel in Egypt were as nothing by the side of these phenomena. In truth it seemed alarmingly probable that if Poloski continued to talk about his county, it would shortly absorb all Europe. As a matter of course he was beloved to distraction by his multitudinous retainers; when he should return to them they would pour forth to receive him with shouts, and redden the domed night with bonfires of welcome. Of course also these grandeurs involved a footing in the highest walks of society, and an easy entrÃ©e to all the courts of Europe. His Alice, his adored and dashing Alice, would be a âsure-enough countess and no mistake,â he declared, falling back upon one of his favorite âslangsâ for a vividness of description suited to the brilliant fact. In a word, the copious and imaginative man confessed and affirmed himself to be a most desirable match, both in spirituals and temporals. Mrs. Dinneford could not help swallowing somewhat of a tale which was put to her lips so often and so earnestly. She was hopefully anxious to believe; she shut her eyes and opened her mouth, as children say; doubt was such a torment that she almost prayed for faith. Moreover, it is the nature of women, shielded as they usually are from the business-like realities of life, to grant easy credence to the new, the unheard of, the marvellous. The excellent lady actually feared at times lest her own and her daughter's head should be turned by the social altitudes which they were about to ascend. She thought of Satan leading people up into high mountains, and promising them kingdoms and the glory thereof, if they would fall down and worship him. She meditated upon the warnings and reproofs which her favorite Massillon (she read him in a translation) levelled against the âgreat ones of the earthâ who forget that they are human. As for Alice, that credulous and ambitious young lady had fairly departed out of her Yankee senses, and resided altogether in cloud-castles of Polish construction. We must not linger long on the delectable mountains of this Poloski engagement. Of course there was a deal of love-dalliance between Miss Dinneford and her noble adorer, which we should find savory to the minutest sugared crumb, if we could stop to feed upon it. But delicacy with regard to the young lady, and the summoning voices of more important adventures, oblige us to omit tasting of these deleterious sweets. We must, however, state the satisfactory fact that the Count's presents were all that a future countess could reasonably expect. A superb engagement ring was the forerunner of pearl brooches, coral earrings, choice mosaics, and other similar proofs of highborn, opulent affection. Even Mrs. Dinneford was presently driven to admit that Poloski's revenues must be ample, and that his heart seemed to be in the right place. Indeed, gifts came in so abundantly and of such an obviously costly nature, that this mother in Israel, educated to regard economy as a weighty duty and a bright virtue, felt herself called upon to remonstrate. âYou are giving Alice too much,â she whispered to the extravagant grandee. âIt really seems to me like wasting wealth, and I fear that some day it may be regretted. Such generosity may spoil any girl, and lead her to expect too much hereafter. You must forgive me for quoting to you a line of my favorite poet, Tupper: Rashly give they, and afterward are sad, a gift that doubly erred.â âBah! a few inexpensive trifles,â laughed the Count, showing all his fine teeth. âExcuse me, my very dear Mrs. Dinneford, for treating your most kind and valued warning with gayety. I am profoundly impressed by the softness of your heart and the hardness of your head. But money is a drug. There is more where this comes from. I haven't got to the bottom of my pile by a long shot.â He quoted so many of our American âslangs,â and he laughed so victoriously after each one of them, that Mrs. Dinneford was silenced for a moment. âBesides, there is more coming,â continued Poloski. âWe shall have plenty to live on. Miss Dinneford is to get a fortune from the Wetherel estate. Aha! you see that I know all. There is money on both sides. Why should there not be a few jimcracks and knicknacks?â âI ought to speak to you about that,â answered the good woman promptly and firmly. âYou have heard, I suppose, that my poor cousin, Judge Wetherel, left us a large property. It is my duty as a Christian woman to tell you the exact truth of the matter. The will was lost and all the estate goes to Edward Wetherel.â âI knowâI have understood,â hastily muttered the Count. He was not looking at her; his eyes were wandering unsteadily about the room; he seemed to her to be awaiting further information. âEdward may give us something,â hesitated Mrs. Dinneford, who did not feel quite certain of the gift, now that Alice was about to make this dubious match in spite of Edward. âHe has declared his purpose of so doing. I query and worry daily as to whether we ought to accept.â âIs he mad, and are you all mad?â exclaimed the Count, turning upon her with a stare of irritated amazement. âWhy should you not accept? But he will not give. No man gives away a fortune who is not forced. The thing is to force. You wait! I will attend to this business. You wait and see. All that is yours shall come to you. The moment I shall have power to act for Miss Alice I will make things to happen. I will make some one restore that estate. You shall have all your money. You wait and trust in me. Say nothing. Keep dark. Wait.â âDo you mean to charge Edwardâ?â stammered Mrs. Dinneford, opening her eyes wide in an obscurity full of horrors, and feeling as if she were turning dizzy on the verge of an abyss. âI charge nothing,â answered the Count, still looking away from her. âBut I will cause some one to disgorge. Wait till I am married. I will see to all. I ask nothing of you but to trust in me and keep dark.â He would explain no further. Mrs. Dinneford went out from this interview quite confounded and terrified by it. What frightful thing had the man uttered, or rather what frightful thing had he concealed? But after much meditation she decided that his discourse had been mere high-flying babble, such as she supposed foreigners could not help indulging in, especially if they were counts. Alice, when informed of Poloski's tall talk, expressed the same opinion of it. âIt is just some of his blank verse,â she said in a tone of half petulance, half apology. âI must admit that he does sometimes go on like a fairy-tale, or like Mother Goose's Melodies,â she added, unable to control her Wetherel wit. âBut I believe all those European continental folks do the same. They have so much more vivacity and imagination than we Yankees! He has said something of this sort to me once or twice. I don't know what he believes or what he means to do. I didn't ask him. I didn't want to talk about it. It is such a horrid, hateful subject.â After a little she resumed hesitatingly: âMotherâdo you suppose Edward can haveâdone anything wrong?â âOh, Alice!â implored Mrs. Dinneford, putting up her hands. âDon't say any such words to me. They are like the whisperings of Satan. We must resist such thoughts as uncharitable and wicked temptations.â âI don't believe in him as I did,â murmured Alice, who had not forgiven Edward for opposing her match and maligning her lover. âWalter believes in him,â replied Mrs. Dinneford, with a profound confidence in the intelligence of Lehming, and little knowing the doubts by which he was tormented. âYou shan't misjudge my Count,â broke out Alice, after watching her mother's worried face for an instant. âHe is not to blame for having his suspicions. A great many people have had suspicions. Just think what a muddle it has all been. Uncle Wetherel dead, and Nestoria spirited away, and the whole thing as black as midnight!â âI know,â sighed Mrs. Dinneford. âWe have cause to be thankful for that we have been allowed to keep our reason amid it all.â âAnd you won't think hardly of him because he talks a little fancifully now and then?â begged the girl. âYou will think kindly of him?â âI will,â promised the mother, unable to resist an only child, a child, too, whom she was not used to resisting. But Mrs. Dinneford and even Alice herself did come to feel a little hardly toward the noble Poloski, when a few days later he broached the idea of an immediate marriage, to be followed by instant departure for Europe. âI have letters which call for me to arrive,â he alleged. âI must arrive as soon as I can go. There are family affairs, very urgent. My sister is about to contract a marriage which is undemeaning of her and of our family. I must hasten to prevent it.â What should be done? What girl wants to be hustled through that triumphal march, that review which celebrates love's greatest victory, an engagement? The wedding trousseau was not selected; the robes of silk and the garments of fine linen were not made up; the hymeneal glories of all sorts were in an entirely embryonic condition. Mrs. Dinneford mildly argued against the confounding proposition, while Alice protested, implored, pouted, and finally wept. The Count did not take opposition sweetly, and there was a scene of the kind known as a love quarrel. For a time the two women stood firm, upheld by the importance and grandeur of the situation, and by that habit of commanding the inferior sex which American females have. It was proposed that the patrician lover should go to Poland alone, and return as soon as he had finished his lofty business. But he looked so sulky over this suggestion that it seemed quite probable that he might not return at all. What if one of those titled ladies whom he would be sure to encounter in the courts of Europe should throw herself at his head and cause him to forget the simple New York girl who had nothing to give him but a heart and some democratic dollars? Moreover, he was heard to mutter something about the insulted honor of his family and the possibility of a duel. These bugbeara were too much for Alice. In general a woman does not want to break off an engagement unless she is comfortably certain of entering promptly upon another, seizing the hand of Number Two simultaneously with dropping that of Number One. Furthermore, Alice, like most newly betrothed girls, had just set seriously to the work of loving. The Count had been dazzling to her before he proposed; but now that he had been accepted, he was precious. It is one of the noble characteristics of the feminine heart that in general it worships all the more earnestly for winning. Alice was beginning to be honestly and almost passionately and we must say admirably infatuated with her man, for the reason that she had got him and could call him her own. When it seemed likely that she might have to part with him, and when she was assaulted by the still more dreadful idea that he might rush into mortal combat if she did not watch over him, she gave up her rapturous dream of a long engagement and a splendid wedding, and consented to become a wife without trousseau or cards. The surrendry of Alice was punctually followed by that of Mrs. Dinneford. âI consent,â she said, dropping a tear over the thought of so early a parting. âHeaven's will be done!âif it is heaven's will,â she added with some temper. âBut I shall follow you, if you are gone two months. I shall break up and rent the house and follow you.â âI shall be delighted, I am sure,â bowed the Count with a grin which expressed a very skeleton-like sort of joy. And so the wedding day was fixed for a week later: it was the 25th of November which was to be thus honored; and on the 26th the happy couple were to set sail for Hamburg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLV. A PHILANTHROPIC CONSPIRACY. One naturally marvels what the able and energetic Edward Wetherel is doing all this while, and why he does not interfere in some Olympian manner to save his cousin from her risky entanglement. In apology for the young man we must observe that it is not so easy to deliver a young woman who positively objects to deliverance. Besides, he was breathlessly busy in these days, as indeed he had been ever since the tragedy of Sea Lodge, although we have not deemed it worth while to follow him up in his labors, which resulted in nothing more than mere futile rushing and raising of dust, like the speed of a blinded Jehu who drives furiously to arrive nowhere. It is only fair to him that we should listen to a bemoaning apology for himself which he uttered about this time to Lehming. âI am bringing nothing to pass,â he exclaimed fretfully. âBut it does seem to me that it is less my fault than the fault of ungovernable circumstances. I have been driven to grapple with two awful mysteriesâthat of my uncle's assassination, and that of Nestoria's disappearanceâand they have wasted all my time, and beaten me.â Lehming was smitten by a twinge of conscience and of compassion. He had by this time recovered a certain degree of trust in Edward's innocence of murder; and for a moment he was impetuously tempted to say, âI will show you Nestoria.â âHorrible problems!â resumed Wetherel, shaking his head with a pathetic air of lassitude. âThey are too much for human ingenuity. They are like ghosts to whom daybreak has not yet come, and who will persist in walking the earth. Not one happy accident has favored my search; not one disentangling clew has fallen within reach of my hands; and Heaven knows how eagerly they have groped. But I am not the only one who is bailled; I am only one of a perplexed multitude. The mousing of justice is equally at fault, and the scent of public suspicion. The police of New York is as completely bewildered as the police of Connecticut. Is it not monstrous and demoralizing that one vile assassin should be an overmatch for all the human race? It is not true that murder will out. It is a popular delusion, helpful to the general conscience undoubtedly, but as false almost as a superstition of fairies or witches. Since I have been engaged in seeking out this homicide I have heard of dozens and scores of others, all equally fallen into the dust of mystery and become impalpable. Unconvicted and unsuspected murderers elbow us in the streets. It is a hideous, haunted world. I have some such feeling about it as men must have had in other days when they believed in spectres, brownies, wizards, troubling goblins, and physical manifestations of Satan. I am constantly discovering, or rather seeming to discover, things which are invisible to others' eyes, and which probably do not exist. Every day, and I might almost say every hour, I see possible assassins. I am followed and whispered to by credulities and suspicions which vanish as soon as I question them. The earth has changed to me; it is no longer an ordinary, natural, sunlit planet; it is a valley of the shadow of death, full of demoniacal apparitions. Bunyan saw a part of existence as I see the whole of it.â There was a passion, an exaltation, and a lyrical extravagance in his language which showed that his imagination had been heated and set on fire by the crime which had impinged upon and deflected his life. There had been a collision of a mighty event with a soul, like the fabled shock of a comet against a planet, and the result had been a conflagration. In his other days of commonplace being he could not have talked with this lurid fervor of fancy. Lehming listened to him and looked up at him with that surprise which we accord to those who have ascended some mount of transfiguration. âHad you not better suspend for a time this search after the assassin?â he asked with hesitation. âIt may end in becoming a fixed idea, and interfere with your usefulness throughout life.â âYes,â conceded Wetherel with a sigh. âIt may. It has already wasted much time for me. For months now I have done next to nothing but grope for traces of crime without finding them. I have not shown myself to much advantage. I have been a mole, working incessantly, but working under earth, and finding no exit. All the plans for doing some little good, which I blabbed and bragged about to you a while since, have come to nothing. You remember that I proposed to instruct and help the working classes. I haven't done it; of course I haven't. How can a man carry out philanthropies when he is startled every day by some false view-halloo after an atrocity which concerns his good name and happiness? Now I am in chase of the murderer of my uncle, and now of the kidnapper of Nestoria. I am not a sufficiently great man to be a mighty worker and a benefactor of my kind amid such a distracting hurly-burly. I can only say for myself that I have nearly settled that estate, and that I have made some progress in my medical studies.â Lehming still pondered whether he should reveal the hiding-place of Nesstoria to this man who seemed so honestly and passionately eager to find her. But he remembered the girl's word, wait; he remembered his promise that he would keep her secret; and, with a profoundly troubled spirit, he turned to another urgent subject. âWhat will you do with the Dinnefords?â he asked. âHere is this wretched marriage. If you pay those two women some large sum of money, what will become of it? Poloski, whatever else he may be, is a gambler and a spendthrift.â âI am master in this matter, of course,â replied Wetherel. âI shall pay them, but under a trusteeship, and I shall be the trustee. I decided upon that step as soon as I heard of the engagement.â âHave you ever considered one thing?â continued Lehming. âI have thought of it repeatedly, but never when in your company. This willâthis will that you accept and talk of executingâyou have no knowledge of it except through Mrs. Dinneford.â âMrs. Dinneford is such an entirely unselfish and honorable woman that I should hardly doubt her unsupported word, even in a transaction so much to her benefit,â replied Wetherel tranquilly. âBut I have other evidence. In the first place, my uncle told me that he should cut me off, and he was a man who never said more than he meant. In the second place, I found in his journal a record of the making of the will, and a summary of its leading provisions.â âAh!â said Lehming. âAll that is new to me. I have occasionally wondered whether you were not acting on insufficient testimony.â âNo,â responded Wetherel. For a moment the two superbly unselfish men looked at each other in admiration. âI thought you knew all this,â resumed Wetherel with a smile. âYou are very incurious about your own affairs, and indifferent about money. I dare say it is well for civilization that some men set greater store by it.â âUndoubtedly,â admitted Lehming. âThe greedy and even the miserly are immensely useful, in spite of their egotistic and sordid motives. Capitalists are essential to the advancement of the material and also the intellectual and moral interests of mankind. I have no doubt that Sallust's gardens and even Lucullus's suppers helped to elevate the human race.â At this moment up came Wolverton, radiant as usual with the careful dandyism of thirty odd, but with a perturbed air of having something on his mind and of finding it a worrying novelty. âHave you heard anything?â asked Wetherel eagerly, as if he expected important information. âA good deal,â answered Wolverton in a hurried, confidential tone. âHe's a tough curse, that fellow is. I got Sweet to track him again, and Sweet has a doose of a story to tell, and I believe it. He doesn't go to Riley's any more; but why doesn't he? Because he has set Riley's daughter wrong; at least that is what Sweet tells me, you know; and so the girl's father and brothers are after him. Of course he could make it all right by marrying the little fool; but that he won't do because she's common trash, and he's a gentleman. Isn't the whole thing devilish ridiculous? Poloski too much of a gentleman to marry Riley's daughter! Besides, there's this other bewitched young lady (I beg your pardon) and a chance of getting a fortune by her, or at least a moderate pot of money. Of course he isn't going to marry poor little Riley. Well, the result is (so Sweet tells me) that his life is in danger. If the male Rileys meet him, they'll break his skull or something of that sort, and he knows it. That's why he wants to hurry up the wedding and get off for Europe.â âIt must be stopped,â scowled Edward. âWe must take this story at once to Mrs. Dinneford.â âYesâif it will be of any use,â drawled Wolverton. âI'll hunt up Sweet, and we'll all go together, if it will be of any use. But will it? Women are so devilish unbelieving of warnings in such matters! The man who says, You are a dear creature, is always believed; the man who says, You are not a dear creature, he is a liar; that's the way women judge. Can't you thrash the chap within an inch of his life, or get some one to do it? Sweet would hammer him to a jelly, for money enough. That's my idea.â âIt would not convince them,â judged Wetherel. âBesides, it is an unmannerly, disorderly way of doing things, begging your pardon, Wolverton.â âOh, we mustn't stand on decorum with such a low beast,â said the dandy. âManners are for gentlemen.â âBut my relations would always think ill of it,â persisted Wetherel. âI should lose their esteem and confidence. I want to convince them that the fellow is a knave, before I treat him as such.â âYou are different from what you used to be,â said Wolverton. âYes,â asserted Wetherel gravely. âI should have thrashed him once, I suppose, without stopping to think. I have been sobered, you know.â âOh, I dare say,â mumbled Wolverton, shrugging his shoulders a little as he thought of that ugly business, the Wetherel Affair. âWell, let's see. You want to expose him. I can bring about a sort of exposure, if there is time for it. Here we are at the 23d, and the wedding comes off on the 25th, and they sail on the 26th. There isn't much leeway. However, what I can show is this: I can show it to be pretty certain that Poloski hasn't any property; I can show, too, that he is charging all his bills, or some of them, to Mrs. Dinneford.â âThat will help,â said Edward. âOh, yes, I can make a pretty fair showing there,â laughed Wolverton. âIt's a good joke. He's run up lots of bills for Mrs. Dinneford to settle. His wedding clothes, his presents to the young lady, the engagement ring, and so onâthey are all down against the mother. You see he has been around among the foreign dealers, the Jews and so forth, and told them who he is going to marry, and got his two or three thousand dollars on credit. The bills are to go in to the old lady on the 27th, the day after the happy pair have started for Europe. Now that can be shown. Sweet knows of three or four heavy accounts, and says there are others. You see he has had his eye on Riley's gang for some time back, and on Poloski as a supposed member of it. He found out that the noble foreigner had been buying largely of late, and he looked into it; and, as I told you, he came across three or four bouncing bills charged to Mrs. Dinneford, and heard of others. By the way, Wetherel, Sweet wants some money.â âI'll give him something,â returned Edward. âSuppose we look him up and set him about this exposure. I am greatly obliged to you, Wolverton, for attending to my business for me, and doing it so well.â âOh, it's nothing,â drawled the dandy. âIn fact, it rather amuses me, and slaughters the time. Besides, I want to smash Poloski.â A walk to the Tombs and a brief search through that sombre and grimy edifice (within human memory the pride of New York) brought the three men face to face with detective Sweet. He was dressed in a velveteen shooting-jacket, double-breasted vest of the same material, and corduroy trousers, all showing signs of wear and tear, especially the latter. He looked a little worn and torn himself, too, his face being as red and scratched as if somebody had been filing it, his eyes unusually bloodshot and one of them surrounded by a bluish halo, and his knuckles âbarkedâ in various degrees of rawness. âExcuse my breath, gentlemen,â he hoarsely apologized as he drew confidentially close to Wolverton and Wetherel. âI've been taking a restorer or two. Up all night last night.â âI want to see you about that Pole, Count Poloski,â said Wetherel. âYou tell Mr. Wolverton here that the man has been getting his accounts charged to a Mrs. Dinneford. Can you prove that?â âI can get the bills,â declared Sweet with cheerful promptness. âI can getâlet me seeâsix. I can bring you six of them debits any day you want.â âDo you know where Mrs. Dinneford lives?â âI can get full name, number, and street, off one of the dealers' books. It was all down.â âVery well. Now have those bills sent in to-morrow, the 24th of November, at twelve o'clock, without fail. Here is something for your expense and trouble thus far. Can I depend on you? To-morrow at noon.â âTwelve sharp,â replied Mr. Sweet. âThank you, sir; you're a gentleman. Twelve to-morrow, November 24th. You can bet on me. Do you want 'em presented for collection? All right. I'll bring the chalks myself, with a C. O. D. No; that won't do, either. I don't want this man to know that I am on his trail in any way. I'll send the dealers.â âIf you fail, it is the last job you get through me,â said Wetherel grimly. âIf I fail, may I be busted!â imprecated Mr. Sweet. âOh, you just lay your pile on me. Good morning, Mr. Wetherel. Very much obliged to you. You're a gentlemanâand a cutthroat prehaps,â he muttered to himself as the three visitors went out of hearing. âBut I don't know 's I much blame him,â he continued to soliloquize in a fair-minded spirit. âA million is a pile of money. It's enough to make any man kill his uncle. And if Wetherel done that job, he's a regular smart one, and I respect him. He hain't left a trail, and he's as sassy as a saint in Paradise.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVI. SEVERE MERCY. A LITTLE before noon of the day preceding the one fixed for Alice's patrician nuptials, Edward Wetherel and Walter Lehming arrived at Mrs. Dinneford's house to await the advent of Count Poloski's creditors. The two women were tired, but hard at work, and anxious enough in the secret places of their hearts, but gay in countenance. There were many important things yet to be done; there was a hasty bridal robe which must have some final embellishments; there was a dressmaker to be supplied from moment to moment with ribbons and other necessaries of life; there was a collation, just decided upon, which must be ordered instantaneously from Delmonico's; there was the inevitable hurly-burly of a wedding that is to be. Lehming's compassionate heart turned sick as he looked upon these preparations for woman's highest ceremony of happiness and honor, and thought how soon they would tumble into disappointment, grief, and shame. âHad you not better try to rest, you two?â he said. âYou will want strength by and by.â âDid you ever know a girl who hadn't strength enough to get married?â replied Mrs. Dinneford, and not by any means gloomily, for the excitement of the occasion had given her a vivaciousness which verged upon gayety. âIt is the one thing that a daughter of Eve can always find the might to do, even if she is at death's door. âWhat is the matter with you, Walter?â burst in Alice gleefully. âYou look as white as if you were going to be married yourself. Now, if you are turning pale on my account, you may save yourself the trouble. My Count will be a good husband. You wait and see.â Lehming glanced imploringly at Edward. He pitied this infatuated girl and this overborne mother with all the fervor of his sensitive spirit. Foolish as he knew the desire to be, he half wished that the exposure which was to turn their blithesomeness into weeping, might be averted, and half hoped that if they should have their bewildered will, it might not be to their hurt. But there was no relenting in that other young man; he was as calmly resolute and unflinching as his uncle might have been in his place; he was a Wetherel of the ancient, remorseless, Cromwellian type. âDo sit down and take a minute's repose,â begged Lehming, seizing Mrs. Dinneford's tired, trembling hands, and drawing her to a sofa. âEdward, I am out of all patience with you,â said Alice. âYou look as grim as a justice. I know what you are thinking, and I don't like it. Besides, it's of no use. You can't make me give up this step at the eleventh hour. I shall get married. So don't say a word about it and don't scowl. What do you want to spoil my wedding for? It is too bad. My own cousins groaning and glowering at me! It is too bad.â She was about to cry, but just then the door bell rang, and in an instant she was all cheerful excitement, her cheeks glowing and her eyes sparkling splendidly âThere are the ribbons,â she laughed. âWhy don't they answer that bell? I wonder if there is a servant in the house.â The domestics were slow in coming. Meanwhile there was another ring, and another, and another. âThey must be out, those creatures,â exclaimed Alice petulantly. âI will go,â volunteered Edward, guessing what visitors waited admittance. He stepped into the hall, opened the street door, and ushered in six men, all wearing more or less of the shopkeeping air and all of foreign aspect. âWhat is your business?â he asked. âMy bishnish ish money,â answered a somewhat greasy and rancid youngster of brief stature and aquiline profile, at the same time exhibiting a slip of paper. Wetherel looked with an imperturbable countenance from one to another of the half dozen. Each and every one held forth a bill, with more or fewer words of stammering explanation, meanwhile glancing suspiciously at his comrades. âIsh this a do?â asked the one who had first spoken. âLet me have your bills,â responded Wetherel. âAnd wait here.â Stepping back into the parlor, he said in a clear, strong, merciless tone,â âMrs. Dinneford, here are six tradesmen with their accounts. What shall I say to them?â âI don't owe a cent in the world,â exclaimed the astonished lady. âI pay everything by the week.â âJust look at these and see what they mean,â persisted Edward, handing her the slips of paper. Mrs. Dinneford put on her spectacles and read aloud, âOne diamond ring âthree hundred dollars! I never bought a diamond ring in my life,â she broke out. âDid you, Alice?â The young lady's face was scarlet, and she merely responded by shaking her head. âOne coat, one pair pants, one vest,â continued the mother, glancing at a second bill. âWhy, this is some ridiculous mistake. These men have got the wrong house.â But she looked agitated; she had her pang of wretched divination; it seemed to her that something ugly was at hand. âCome in here, all of you,â summoned Edward, opening the door into the hall. âCome in and explain.â They entered, the entire half dozen; they told their six stories in six dialects of imported English; and all the six swindling, humiliating tales were one. Mr. Boloski, or Boloshki, or Ploskee, or Plosk, as they variously styled him, had bought this, that, and the other at âour shop,â and ordered the bill for the âlotâ to be sent to Mrs. Dinneford, or Tinnevoort, or whatever it might be. The miserable mother, still not quite comprehending this confounding and disreputable muddle, turned and stared at her still more miserable daughter. Alice had not spoken since the men entered the room, and she could not speak now. She had dropped into the chair which stood nearest, her face entirely destitute of color and her head swimming. One of the duns, an unwholesomely sallow little creature, with wavy, glossy, carefully-brushed jet hair, had his beadlike, glittering eyes fixed on her hands. She noticed his glance, and it startled her like the crawling of a serpent, and she found power for action and utterance. With a shudder of disgust she commenced stripping her fingers of emeralds and diamonds. âThere they are,â she said, handing Poloski's betrothal offerings to Lehming, who had stepped toward her with a fear that she might swoon. âGive them to their owners. Mother, you must get the corals and the other things, and send them too.â Then came a sobâan outburst of insupportable humiliationâand with a rush and flutter she was gone. âGo with her,â urged Lehming, addressing the stupefied mother. âWe will attend to these men.â âYes,â added Wetherel. âCome into the hall, you people,â he continued to the six clerks. âI will tell you what this means.â He led them out, and after a few words of explanation, sent them away, some of them happy at recovering their merchandise, and others gloomy over the prospect of collecting from Poloski. When he returned to the parlor he was astonished by finding Alice there. She was crying, without even trying to wipe away her tears, or seeming to know that they were falling. She was weeping, sobbing, talking, and pacing the room all at once; it was a storm of grief, of shame, and of anger overmastering both; it was weakness, and yet it was strength. âI came backâI wouldn't stay up stairs,â she gasped out between her sobs. âI have just one thing to sayâjust one thing and no more. He is all you told me. I believe everything now. He is a contemptible liar and swindler and impostor. I have done with him. Oh, no doubt about that. I came back to tell you so. I never will see him again. Never! If he has the face to come here, I want you to drive him away. He is a mean impostor. He is a liar. I don't believe a word he ever told me. You have carried your point, Edward. I suppose you did this. You have almost killed me. But I thank you. Is that enough? Are you satisfied? You ought to be.â Edward took her hand, kissed it respectfully, and tried gently to make her sit down. But she resisted him; elastic and strong with hysteria, she broke away and kept on walking the parlor; the storm of sobbing, tears, and sharp, jerky talking did not cease for some minutes. What she said was mainly reiteration; but it was necessary that she should reiterate; nothing else would soothe her agitation. Like her mother, she was a born talker, and must babble out all her emotions or choke with them. âDo be quiet, child!â begged and commanded Mrs. Dinneford repeatedly, alarmed by the girl's excitement. âI must talk or die; let me alone!â returned Alice, and whirled on in her gust of feverish speech. It was like a tempest in autumn woods, only that in place of withered boughs and frostbitten leaves, blighted hopes and joys were blowing about, noisily rustling forth their shame and spite. âI knew itâI knew it all the whileâI knew I was a fool,â she chattered. âI knew at the bottom that I was wrong. I knew it would end badly. And it has. It has served me just right for being such a fool. I would have my own way, and I've got it hot and heavy. I've got it right in my face and eyes. This puts an end to Alice Dinneford. I shan't go out again in society. It's the last beau I shall have, unless I pick up some old gentleman with a shiny top and gold spectacles. You'll see me marry Methusaleh, or the old original Jacob Townsend, if you see me marry at all. But I want this Count to catch trouble, too. Oh, I want him to have the hot end of the poker. I had no business to believe his lies, but he had no business to lie. How glibly he did talk about his estates and his revenues and his money in bank! And he hadn't a cent; charged his wedding coat to my mother; and my engagement presents went down on those Jews' books! Oh, how I do despise him and hate him, and what a time we should have had in a month! I wish he was in jail and grinning through the bars.â âAlice, do hush!â implored the mother. âYou are turning yourself inside out, like a fig-fish on the seashore. You are making a perfect spectacle of yourself.â âAnd why not?â gasped Alice, throwing herself breathless into a chair and patting the floor with her feet. âEdward and Walter know all about it already. I can talk before my cousins, can't I? I can trust them, can't I? And I must talk. I must foam over, or explode. Corking this thing up would kill me. Don't you know it would, mother? You are just like me. If I were not gabbling all the time, you would be.â And, in fact, Mrs. Dinneford was talking all the time, or striving so to do. As was their wont in moments of unusual excitement, the two women ran parallel streams of conversation, each gushing along without much regard to the other, like the Rhone and the Arve at their confluence. Only on this occasion the superior volubility of the daughter constantly put the mother out, and rendered her pretty much inaudible. The burden of the elder lady's fragmentary discourse seemed to be this, that her child had been graciously favored with a wonderful preservation, and that Providence had interfered just in the right season to teach a precious lesson of prudence and humility. Meantime the two men had withdrawn, as it were, to mountains of silence, according to the custom of male creatures when the fountains of feminine eloquence are broken up and the waters thereof overspread all creation. Of a sudden Lehming, who had taken refuge in a window-seat, called sharply, âHere is the man.â âLet him come in,â replied Wetherel calmly. âBut had not you two ladies better leave the room?â âYes; go, Alice,â urged Mrs. Dinneford. âYou must not meet him. Now, child, do go!â âI shan't stir a step,â responded Alice spunkily. âI want to look at him when he catches it.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVII. EXORCISING A SON OF BELIAL. When Poloski entered the parlor Alice neither answered his bow nor evaded his glance, but sat with burning cheeks and sparkling eyes, biting her lips and tossing her foot and staring at him, an incarnation of frank, hearty, quivering, feverish scorn and indignation. For an instant the visitor of course supposed himself at home, and advanced with proffered hand and his usual cordial show of glistening teeth, uttering salutations and compliments to right and left. But when no hand was put forth to take his, and when he saw that all present eyed him with unfriendliness, he was perforce driven to guess that some event adverse to him had befallen. The discovery seemed to startle him quite wonderfully; he became as pale an âaristoâ as a communist could wish to look upon. âI do not understand this deportment,â he stammered, glancing hurriedly from face to face. âI demand to know the meaning of this deportment.â Edward Wetherel, with an imperious gesture which commanded the others to be silent, advanced close to the noble foreigner and looked him instantaneously out of countenance. âMr. Poloski, if that is your real name ââ he began deliberately. âCount Poloski, sir!â interrupted the Pole, making a spring to recover the upper hand in the dialogue. âIn view of this deportment I claim to be addressed by my title.â âIt is my duty to charge you with an imposture,â continued Wetherel, taking no notice of Poloski's reclamation. âYou have betrothed yourself to a young lady, my relative, under pretence of being a man of fortune, while you were so utterly penniless and even without credit, that you were obliged to charge your engagement presents, and even your own wedding outfit, to this young lady's mother.â âIt is not so!â screamed the Count, turning from pale to crimson. âThere is some ridiculous error. I said to charge them to myself. Mrs. Dinneford, I appeal to you, I protest to you, there is some error.â âSix men would not make the same mistake,â Wetherel observed. There have been six tradesmen here, all with bills against Mrs. Dinneford, and all declaring that they presented them by your order.â The Count swore in a whisper under his moustache, like a panther spitting softly through his whiskers. âYour engagement ring,â continued Wetherel, âall your betrothal presents, the clothes you have on your back, the clothes you meant to be married in, the trunks for the wedding journey, your new revolver, dirk, and sword-caneâwe got the bills for all of them a few minutes since, all charged to Mrs. Dinneford.â âIt was a mistake, it was a mistake,â repeated Poloski. âI do assure you solemnly, and upon my sacred honor, it was a stupid, cruel mistake.â âOh, I know it,â smiled his pitiless antagonist. âYou ordered that these accounts should be presented on the 27th, two days after the wedding, and they arrived on the 24th, the day before it. That was the mistake.â âI will not talk with you; I have nothing to do with you!â declared the Count, turning his back on Edward and trying to subdue the women with a glare; for though he was wretchedly cowed and even frightened, he still had some spirit left. âI claim my rights. I demand my betrothed wife.â âGo away, sir!â cried Mrs. Dinneford, rushing in front of her daughter. She was really alarmedâhad, as we remember, an old, native suspicion and fear of foreigners; half expected to see the Pole grab up Alice and run out of doors with her. Poloski fell back and began to wheedle, bowing and extending his arms deprecatingly, and beaming out with such smiles as he could get together in his trouble. âOh, my dear Mrs. Dinneford!â he implored. âHow can you behold in me an object of terror? I offer no violence; I menace no harm. I but ask an interview with Miss Dinneford.â By dint of dodging about he caught several glimpses of Alice's face, and meanwhile he made her a series of short speeches, backing them up with smiles and gestures. âMiss Dinneford!â in a tone of reproach. âMy dear Miss Dinneford!â in a tone of entreaty, âAlice!â in a tone of romantic sweetness. âWill you not grant me one word? One single moment alone? A chance to explain? A chance to reassure you? Oh, for the sake of the vows we have interchanged, give me one instant of interview!â Alice continued to gnaw her lips without opening them. In this talkative young lady silence was an unmistakable sign of extreme, ungovernable irritation in the way of wrath. Mrs. Dinneford, who of course knew all her daughter's moods, absolutely trembled at seeing her speechless, fearing lest the next thing might be hysterics or some act of violence. âEdward! Edward!â she called eagerly, at the same time signing Poloski away. Wetherel advanced, and before him the Count retreated, halting, however, near the door. There he surveyed his foes with a perplexed expression, obviously very anxious to make his peace with them and reÃ«stablish the engagement, but quite as obviously doubtful whether he had best utter all that was upon his mind. His eyes wandered; his lips parted and closed again several times; he had something to say, and did not know how to put it. âYou must excuse me,â he began at last with an apologetical smile, âI have to tell you one thing which it seems you know not. You are all laboring under a social misapprehension. What I have done is not strange in Europe. When a nobleman goes to espouse aâhow shall I say it?âI mean no offence âa bourgeoiseâshe always pays the bills. That is understood; that is the bargain; everybody understands it soâthat is, everybody in Europe. The nobleman has rank and the bourgeoise has money; and they swap, as you Americans say; they swap. She gives him her money and he gives her his rank. I have known of many young nobles who have had all their wedding expenses paid by their betrotheds when the latter were bourgeoises. It is nothing new in Europe. It is understood.â It may easily be guessed that Mrs. Dinneford and Alice were thunderstruck by what seemed to them the outrageous insolence of this business-like explanation. I do not know what they would have said if they could have spoken; probably there would have been a scornful and angry outburst to the effect that an American lady is the equal of any noble; but the lucky fact is that they were stricken dumb, and so preserved their dignity by not uttering a word. Edward answered for them, and not without a certain moderation and considerateness of tone, for he was half inclined now to believe that he had a real aristocrat before him, so patrician-like was the Count's cool assumption of social superiority. âYou are quite right, Poloski,â he said. âYou have stated the European idea correctly. But it makes no difference. My relatives do not want an alliance with you on such an understanding, or on any understanding. You should not have acted in this matter covertly. As things are, you are a confessed liar, and, I think I may add, swindler. Now go, and let us hear no more of you.â âA liar! a swindler!â grinned Poloski furiously, jumping forward three inches or thereabouts. âBut no!â he added, checking his mad career âYou know nothing of honor. You would call the police. You are a coward.â âGo away and don't be noisy, or I shall call the police,â continued Wetherel in a quiet, resolute voice. âHa!â hissed the Count, slowly retreating. âCall the police! You? A murderer call the police! What a joke is that!â Both men were ghastly white now, but Wetherel advanced and Poloski recoiled. When the latter found himself in the hall he grappled up his hat, clapped it upon his head with such force as if he were loading and ramming himself into it, and, emboldened by this action of defiance, turned to blaze out a last word. âRevenge!â he shouted, in a style which italics, capitals, and exclamation points can but faintly symbolize. âRevenge!! Revenge!!!â It was such a salvo of menacing elocution as perhaps was never paralleled before in real life, not even among the Count's own rhetorical countrymen. We can only account in full for his preposterous emphasis by supposing that he was familiar with our drama, and imagined that certain popular American actors do really and truly hold the mirror up to American nature, and inferred that, if he did not roar, his anger would not be believed in. It is a pity that Miss Imogen Eleonore Jones could not have heard him; she would have found in him a hero of the sort which she had learned to admire in the âSpasmodicâ; she would have joyed in such a rich and rare manifestation of the ideal. Well, he had scarcely exploded ere he was gone, tearing open the street door, skipping briskly out of it, slamming it behind him, and flying down the steps as if he were exemplifying the chorus, âRig a jig, jig, and away we go.â When Wetherel reÃ«ntered the parlor, with an irrepressible smile of Anglo-Saxon scorn on his lips, he found that Alice had leaped from her seat on the sofa, and was gazing out of a window. She turned a flushed face toward him, and asked in an eager, panting, way, âDid you kick him out, Edward?â âNo,â replied the young man, wondering if he had come short of the girl's expectations. âHe seemed to kick himself out. He went off like a shilling cannon, loaded to the muzzle. He gave a great bang in one direction and vanished like lightning in the other.â âOh, how I hate him!â burst out Alice, thoroughly disgusted with her discharged lover and with herself. A moment later she began to cry violentlyâ an altogether bewildered and hysterical and nearly demented young lady, beset at once by grief, humiliation, anger, and no one can tell what other emotions. âDear me, if the brazen nature of sin hasn't been uncovered and revealed to-day most wonderfully!â exclaimed and moralized Mrs. Dinneford, as she led Alice away to her bedroom to administer soothing and repose. âI really thought, in my simplicity, that fraud and lying and all wickedness were mistrustful and timorous and shamefaced, fearing the eye of the upright and the injured. And here I have seen a son of Belial as bold as if he were the lion of the tribe of Judah. I do believe that that impostor would have the front to walk into the New Jerusalem and claim the highest saintly throne there, and put a crown on his head and go to singing.â After the two women had retired, Wetherel turned to Lehming and observed, âApparently this battle is won.â âYou have won it,â replied the meek and gentle manikin. âI have done nothing. I have no nerve for combats. Do you know that I actually pitied that exposed swindler, and could hardly look in his degraded, wretched face?â âI have not done with him,â said Wetherel. âHe must be followed up and driven out of New York society, before he victimizes another innocent.â âOf course,â nodded Lehming. âAnd, by the way, perhaps a word more may be needed here to keep our friends from readmitting him. You know that, after Diabolus was chased out of the city of Mansoul, he got in again. You must be monitor to the Dinnefords, and make them promise not to let Poloski into the house; for if he once gets a chance to lick them with his slimy tongue, he is anaconda enough to swallow them. Do you stay and warn. must go.â He was anxious to get back to his lodgings and see to the safety of Nestoria. Of late he was always troubled about her when she was out of his sight, imagining that she had been discovered by the police, or had been suddenly frightened into running away, or in some other way had stumbled down the steeps of calamity. We must understand that she had by this time grown terribly precious to him, and had become the centre and cause of nearly all his thoughts and emotions. Quitting the Dinneford house, he made for Fourth avenue at the best pace permissible to his shortness of limb and of breath, and jumped into a street car which was humming and droning, like a huge, slow bumblebee, in the direction of his lodgings. From time to time the heavy vehicle halted, or perhaps only slackened its lumbering jog, to take on or put off other passengers. He was moralizing over the matter; he was saying to himself that this was like the great chariot of human life, every second souls born into it and souls dying out of it, yet the chariot always full and seemingly of much the same people; he was thinking of these things in his imaginative, tender, serious way, when two persons in the car suddenly aroused his earnest attention. One of them was his fellow lodger, Imogen Eleonore Jones, and the other was that no doubt useful but not altogether agreeable official, Mr. Sweet. What startled Lehming was the fact that these two individuals appeared to have some understanding; either they knew each other already, or they were in a state of mind to strike up an acquaintance; at all events they exchanged frequent and interested glances. If they were intimates, or if they should become such, would Nestoria's secret remain hidden? Would it not tumble out of Miss Jones's shallow âbread-basketâ into the dangerous hands of detective Sweet?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLVIII. A STREET-CAR FLIRTATION. Lehming was so alarmed by the ocular telegraphing which he observed between Sweet and Imogen Eleonore that he lost his self-possession and decided upon the wrong course of action. He sat on the same side of the car with the girl, but partitioned from her and thrown into shadow by the vast bulk of a portly old gentleman in a caped overcoat, who furthermore canopied his little figure with an open newspaper. He might have revealed himself to Miss Jones, interrupted her mysterious communications with the detective, and escorted her home. But there was a little guilt upon his soul; he knew that he was hiding from justice a witness whom justice needed and demanded; and the result was that he himself had a fear of policemen and desired to evade their notice. So he left the car furtively, took a hack at the nearest stand, and drove with all purchasable speed homeward, discovering indeed that Nestoria was still unmolested, but leaving the simple schoolma'am to the machinations of Mr. Sweet. Now these two we must follow and watchânot because they are already acquaintances, but because they are to become such. Mr. Sweet was on duty, but, as in the case of Satan, his duty permitted him to wander much up and down and earth, and even to have âhis little funâ in it. It was his cue to-day to go to and fro in good clothes and otherwise to play the part of a gentleman, so far at least as his kind of nature and grace enabled him to play it. He was on the lookout for female pickpockets, and this was why he had taken a seat opposite Imogen Eleonore. There was in fact something flashy and dashy about that young person's outward attire, as there was, we remember, about her intellectual outfit, the frippery and trappings of various spasmodical heroines. Mr. Sweet, with his usual insight, judged at first glance that she was one of the light-fingered sisterhood, or otherwise of illegal habits, and therefore took a seat where he could watch her. Miss Jones, who soon observed his detective oglings, judged with her usual insight that Mr. Sweet was a gentleman and was smitten with her. So she ogled back; not that she at first meant to do it; in fact she had very proper ideas concerning street-car flirtations; but there was, she felt, such an attraction in this man's gaze as amounted to fascination; and the result was that for every glance she returned a glance. âOho!â said Sweet to himself, suddenly getting a new insight. âThat's what's the matter. She ain't a huntin' for wallets an' wipes. She's out on a flirt.â He had no objection. He was very fond of love-making in public conveyances, and frequently indulged in it when not too much absorbed by his âbiz.â There was to be sure a Mrs. Sweet, who kept an eye on him and sometimes âworked up his caseâ for him, judging him with extreme severity for his politeness to other ladies, or, as he phrased it, âsending him up for seven year.â But his wife was at home minding her business, and so he felt free to gaze tenderly at Miss Jones, and finally to launch a semi-wink at her. Imogen Eleonore was thrilled to the very core of what soul she had by this demonstration of interest. She did not consider it a wink; could not call it by such a vulgar name. To her mind it was a gentle half-closing of the eyes, such as the most romantic and aristocratic of lovers at first sight might indulge in, and very similar to ocular gestures which she had read of in her favorite weekly literature. Such a blush came over the whole of her face that her very hair seemed to be the redder for it, as if the blood had gushed along the capillary tubes. It must be remembered that she was on the whole a plain girl, and that consequently strange gentlemen rarely winked at her. Well, she was not only much moved, but, in spite of her sense of the proprieties, she was gratified. How is a poor young woman, who knows few men and is not courted by any of the fewâhow is she to feel when a fellow traveller in a street-car shows symptoms of admiration? Is a spasm of flattered vanity and of human sympathy to be strictly forbidden under such circumstances? But we cannot stop to apologize for Imogen Eleonore; we have enough to do to tell what she did and what resulted. She looked again at Mr. Sweet; and then he looked at her; and then she looked at him; and then he at her; and so on. Sweet was used to this sort of thing, and worked at it patiently, as if it were a âcase.â He knew by this time what he was about; he was flirting with a milliner, or a shop girl, or some other âpiece of calico;â he had no high and mighty expectations. Miss Jones, much less keen in detecting the caste of people, and deceived by the detective's fashionable raiment (a secondhand suit bought of an actor), supposed that she had touched the heart of some social magnate, and began to wonder whether it would all end in her keeping a carriage. That was the difference between them; the one, though an officer of justice, was a tolerably sharp knave; the other, though an instructor of youth, was a little of a fool. As may be supposed, Imogen Eleonore's fancied carriage did not appear immediately to convey her to a brown-stone front in Fifth avenue. On the contrary, she got out at her usual corner, with a small, depraved-looking grocery stuck on the nib of it, like a brandy blossom on a drunkard's nose, and made her customary pilgrimage down a pungent by-street to her sordid lodgeings. Sweet was eager to follow her, but he had a job on hand which called him further down town, and his noble motto was, business before pleasure. So he simply took a mental note of her costume, speculated for a moment as to whether she lived in this tenement-house, or that, or the other, and then, bending his soul to his duties, forgot her for some hours, as men do forget. Two days later Miss Jones found among the âHeraldâ âpersonalsâ an advertisement which set all her veins throbbing. It read as follows: âWill the lady who rode in the Fourth avenue car, with blue bonnet, stripped silk, and auburn hair, grant a meeting to the gentleman who sat opposite her in Madison Square, with a view to further acquaintance? Address `Herald' Office.â The dazzling signature to this confused piece of English composition was, âDiamond Pin.â âHim!â exclaimed Imogen Eleonore, throwing down the paper with an agitation which revealed how much she had thought of her chance admirer. âHim!!â she repeated with an emphasis rarely equalled in real life, and for some moments could utter no more, or at least did not. She rose and walked the room; she wished people could see her striving with the unknown; she looked at herself in the glass, and made that do. âBe it so!â she broke out at last. âThis life is no longer bearable by woman. I am too much alone with my own heart and with mysteries. I must thrust out a desperate hand for sympathy, and ohâshall I say it?âfor loveâyes, love! Be it in Madison Square or otherwheres, I will meet him, and see at least what he truly is, and judge whether he be worthy. Be still, poor fluttering heart!â and here she laid hands on that organ. âBe not afraid of one venture. Perhaps thy consoler is at the end of my impassioned and desperate resolve. Give me pen and paper,â she added, as if addressing the âpageâ who waits on the heroines of the âSpasmodie.â âLet me answer while I have the strength.â And so she wrote a letter to âDiamond Pinâ (such a letter as he never saw before out of print), informing him that she would dare to meet him in Madison Square, and fixing day and hour for the thrilling rencontre. By dint of much impatient and tremulous waiting the appointed time was reached; and Miss Jones, walking the twilight shades in her best dress, encountered Mr. Sweet in his finest suit. âVery glad indeed to have the honor,â said the detective, taking off his hat with a flourish common to people who âput onâ their manners, instead of wearing them habitually. âI am really so much obleeged that I don't know what to say first,â he added, a little abashed by discovering a gleam of real modesty in Imogen Eleonore's alarmed eyes. âYou see I didn't hope it, and it's really quite a surprise and takes my breath away,â he resumed, summoning back his characteristic impudence and doing his best to look gallant. âWould you mind having my arm, Miss, and walking along as if we was going somewhere? It will seem more like folks, you know.â So Imogen Eleonore, who did not expect to go so far at the first jump, found herself arm in arm with her nameless admirer, and considerably frightened thereat. âOh!â she gasped. âIs not this the very poetry of life! It is terrible.â In reality it was the very doggerel of life; and Mr. Sweet, a prosaic-minded man with some coarse humor in him, rather saw it in that light; while, being used to much severer adventures, and naturally of an undaunted spirit, he could not discover the terribleness at all. âOh, shaw, now!â he said cheeringly, at the same time squeezing Miss Jones's bony wrist with his mighty biceps. âThere ain't nothin awful about it. All we're goin' to do is to just promenade a bit, and talk things over a few minutes and see how we like each other.â âOnly, I should feel more like saying to my fears, begone! if I might be allowed to inquire your name,â observed Imogen Eleonore. âCertainly,â responded this brazen detective. âI don't try to come the incog. over ladies. My name is LivingstoneâC. J. Livingstone.â Miss Jones believed this story, and her features absolutely twitched with excitementâa spasm of mingled fright and delight. She knew who the Livingstones of the manor were well enoughânot merely because as a schoolmistress she was thoroughly âpostedâ in the early history of New York, but also because she was aware of their social fame as one of the chief of the âKnickerbocker families.â Nor would her romantic imagination permit her to doubt that this man, upon whose arm she leaned, was a scion of that aristocratic stock. âIt is a grand name,â she said with humble flattery, and yet not without a painful throb of envy and littleness, remembering her own undistinguished descent and nomenclature. âAnd may I ask your name?â inquired Mr. Sweet in a thrilling murmur, the same hoarse murmur in which he said to barkeepers, âWhiskey straight.â âYou may call meâI would prefer you should call meâthat is until we know each other more thoroughlyâI ask it as a favor that you should call me âDiana Vernon,â stammered Imogen Eleonore, revolting from the thought of saying Jones. âOf course it is not the title of myâmy ancestors,â she apologized; âbut I trust that under the circumstances you will pardon a lady's timidity about exposing herself.â âJust so,â nodded the detective good-naturedly. âDiana Vernon,â he repeated to fix the words in his memory, for he was not a reader of Scott. âI'm satisfied with it if you are.â âAnd now haven't we gone far enough?â said the schoolmistress, seeing that they had reached an end of the square. âI dare not proceed further in this direction.â âOh, well, we'll wheel about and go back again,â assented Mr. Sweet. âOne place is just as good as another, so long as we're together.â By this time Miss Jones had got a little impatient, or at least began to suffer somewhat with suspense. She had come here to be courted, and the courting did not seem to begin. We do not feel at liberty to justify her; we merely claim that her feeling was natural. Furthermore, it was shared by Mr. Sweet, who also thought that it was about time, as he expressed it in his own mind, to âquit fooling round, and proceed to business.â Accordingly he squeezed her arm under his, and remarked, âYou are a mighty nice girl!â âOh, don't say that!â murmured Imogen Eleonore, scared out of her breath now that the wooing had commenced. âBut you are, though, and I'm a-goin' to say it, and stick to it like a pitch plaster,â insisted Sweet with another pressure. âOh, no!âflatter me notâbewilder me not!â pleaded Imogen, throbbing with happiness perhaps as much as alarm. âNow don't put a damâdamper on a feller!â protested Sweet, slipping that ponderous arm of his around her whalebony waist, for he believed that her shyness was in her own way, and that she would be grateful to him for breaking it down. âCome, it's dark enough for us to walk a little closer. Nobody'll see it, or care if they do.â For a moment Miss Jones was paralyzed; for a moment she was squeezed right heartily and without resistance; for, though she seemed to herself to pull away, she did not pull an ounce. But she was really terrified; the magazine of honest modesty which lay at the bottom of her silly soul was all aflame; and she did sincerely want to get out of the hands of her athletic admirer. Unable to use her muscles, she remembered that she once had a voice, and she made a spasmodic effort to get it out. In the next instant the dusk of Madison Square resounded to a squeal of, âUnhand me, wretch!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XLIX. A DETECTIVE IN FULL SCENT. Immediately that Imogen Elconore raised her voice against the aggressions of Mr. Sweet, he, to use his own phrase in describing the scene to a brother detective, âset her loose quicker'n powder.â He was smartly startled and even gravely scared. If one of the regulars should came along, and should turn out not to be a friend of his, he might get reported for disorderliness if he staid, and might catch a âlocustâ across his head if he ran. There was even a chanceâshadowy, it is true, but still disagreeable to considerâof being dismissed from the âforce.â Furthermore the epithet which this girl had applied to him was alarming because so entirely novel. He had been called a great many grievous names in the course of his adventurous life. He had been called a scamp, a scoundrel, a rascal, and a blackguard, with every conceivable accompaniment of supporting blasphemy. But never before, so far as he could remember then or thereafter, had he been addressed as âwretch.â It sounded like print; it was genteel and nobby and highfalutin; it struck him as little less than solemn. With a sudden suspicion that his Diana Vernon might be âa piece of muslin,â instead of âcalico,â he let go of her as promptly as if she were a red-hot poker, and commenced apologizing. âNow, good gracious, don't!â he begged eagerly. âDon't cut up that way. Why I don't care a curse about it, if you don't want it. No idea at all of hurtin' your feelin's or frightenin' you. Why, just look at it. I'm not holdin' you. You can run away if you want to.â But Miss Jones did not want to run away. Like most women who are apologized to, she perceived that she was mistress of the situation; and what she desired was, not to escape from her lover, but to keep him and rule him. She dropped upon a bench, breathed forth a sob or two, and forgivingly asked Mr. Sweet to sit. That gentleman's secret opinion was that he was wasting his time and had better go; but he could not break the enchantment which falls upon male creatures when they are both repelled and invited; so he first took a furtive chew of tobacco to clear his mind and then accepted the invitation. âYou think me very, very strange, no doubt,â sighed Imogen Eleonore by way of rekindling the conversation. âRuther offish,â grimly assented the confounded officer of justice. âYou're what I call a case. You're a case as sure as my name is Sweet.â âI thought your name was Livingstone,â exclaimed Miss Jones, drawing away from him. âSo it isâSweet Livingstone,â rejoined the able detective, promptly remedying his mistake. âBut you said C. J. Livingstone, I thought.â âNo; beg pardon; S. J. Livingstone; that's what I said,â undauntedly affirmed Sweet. âOhâexcuse me,â murmured Imogen Eleonore. âPardon my suspicious nature. I cannot help it. My life has been a mysteryâevery day a tragedy. Always, always, some boding cloud above me, sending down from its murky bosom chilling snows of gloom, and blighting every verdant hour just when life looked all tinted with hope. I have lost my trust; I know it. It is very sad, and I struggle against it, but still I remain suspicious.â âWhat is it all about?â inquired Sweet, somewhat bewildered by her sensational rhetoric, and thinking that perhaps she could âlet him into a case.â âJust confide the whole business to me,â he exhorted in a confidential tone. âMake a clean breast of it; do you good. I may be able to see a way to get you out of it.â Imogen Eleonore hesitated. On reflection it did not seem to her that what tragedies there had been in her life were sufficiently incarnadined with calamity nor sufficiently aglow with romance to arouse the sympathy of a Livingstone. But she wanted to tell something which should make her appear great and interesting to her listener. She began to talk of Nettie Fultonâa few words only, she resolvedânothing that should unveil the secret. âI will not weary you with my own sorrows,â she answered in a certain deep tone of hers which she considered âthrillingâah, thrilling!â âI have nearly forgotten them of late in pitying the griefs of another. Such a mystery! Imagine a lovely young girl, a girl scarcely yet of woman's years, seeking shelter of me from the storms of this cruel world.â Mr. Sweet pricked up his ears. Ignoramus and dunce as he was, he was an eager, unforgetting detective, and he thought instantly of the youthful refugee from Sea Lodge. He awaited the remainder of the story curiously but in sagacious silence. âShe is passing fairâtoo fair for the sun to shine upon rudelyâmuch less the wind and the rain,â pursued Miss Jones. âAh, such pearly tints and azure eyes and golden hair, and a mouth sweet with the roses of eighteen, yet tremulous and imploring, ever imploring with sorrow!â âThe very gal!â guessed the detective, hearkening like a spy of the Council of Ten. âHer tale?â sighed Imogen Eleonore, who, as we remember, knew next to nothing of Nestoria's history. âAh, no! That I may not breathe. Let the wings of obscurity that brood over it brood there forever.â âWhat a pity!â groaned Mr. Sweet. âVery handsome young girl, you say, and ruther little, and fair complexioned. How I do admire golden hair, to be sure!â âYou have described her,â said Miss Jones, flattered by this preference of his for golden hair, her own being of the âred, red gold,â as the ballads say. âBeen with you long?â ventured Sweet. âOnly about three monthsâthree months of grief and of pityâthree months of sorrow and sympathy.â The detective wanted to jump up on the stone seat and crow. It was three months since Nestoria Bernard had vanished; the description of her which he carried in his pocket-book tallied exactly with this Diana Vernon's description of her mysterious protÃ©gÃ©e; and he trusted that he had within his reach the key to the Wetherel case, with all the âmoney that was in it.â In his heart he cursed himself and blessed himself for the luckiest of men; and he renewed his attentions to Miss Jones as respectfully as if she were Astor or Vanderbilt. It was not eager wooing; his soul was intent now upon other things than love; he did not so much as try to obtain a kiss. But he brought about an agreement that they two should write to each other under their assumed names, and that before long they should meet againââah, yes, once again.â âCome, won't you let me go along with you?â he begged as she rose to leave him. âI just want to see where you put up. Won't try to crowd in, 'pon honor. All I want is to walk by the house now and then, and look at it and think you're there.â âAh, never!â shuddered Imogen Eleonore. âI have those who watch me and whom I stand in awe of,â she added, remembering Lehming and John Bowlder, and converting them into overbearing caitiffs by an effort of her fancy. âBut your handsome little friend that's in troubleâI do want to give her a lift,â suggested Sweet. It was an unlucky remark; he had spoken several times already of that handsome friend; had been disagreeably desirous to know whether she âwasn't mighty pretty.â Miss Jones, smitten with jealousy, as also with a creditable fear of exposing Nettie Fulton's mysterious secret, became all the more determined not to exhibit to her admirer the dingy poverty of her lodgings. âNo!â she insisted with unmistakable spunk. âNever will I quit this spot until you promise as a gentleman not to follow me.â âOh, well, I give it up, I promise,â said Sweet. âWord of a gentleman,â he added, grinning under his slouched hat. The moment she left him he summoned a newspaper urchin, clapped a half dollar into his dirty fist, and whispered, âFollow that bit of muslin home, and come back here and tell me the street and number, and I'll give you another fifty.â The boy departed, and the detective walked up and down awaiting his return, shivering in the increasing frostiness of the November blast, but bearing it patiently by the aid of an occasional curse. The very next morning, as Walter Lehming sat before the fire in his study, swallowed up and almost hidden by a high-backed chair, he heard a masculine step in the hall which he at first supposed was John Bowlder's, and then a voice inquiring through his partially open door, âWas any coals ordered here?â âNo, my good man,â he replied, without looking around. âNone in this room.â âIt war a young lady what ordered 'em,â continued the voice. âLight complected young lady, with blue eyes an' golden hair.â Lehming got out of his chair, walked to the door and confronted a preternaturally grimy coalheaver, who recoiled a little on seeing him, touched his ragged hat and mumbled, âBeg pardon, sir.â âI know that no fuel is wanted on this floor,â said the young man staring hard at the blackened features of the intruder, for this description of Nestoria disquieted him. âThere is certainly some mistake.â The next moment his heart was in his mouth; he had recognized Mr. Sweet's bloodshot eye. It was not merely bloodshot, it was peculiar in another respect; there was a strange roundness and openness about it; the lids exposed the whole pupil. It was the man's weak point as a detective, and, knowing it, he generally kept his eyelids drooped when in disguise; but on this occasion he was so surprised by the appearance of a relative of the Wetherels that for a moment he forgot the precaution. Lehming, a sensitive creature, and gifted with that acute observation of physical characteristics which a writer of fiction is apt to have or to acquire, had noticed this singularity of Sweet's optics the very first time that he saw him, and had never forgotten it. What should he do? Dwarfish, fragile, and gentle, he had no aptitude for physical emergencies, though brave and ready enough in the conflicts of the soul. He simply stood still and stared silently at the detective, calm enough in outward appearance, but speechless with alarm. âBeg pardon, sirâsome mistake,â mumbled the spy, turning and walking slowly down stairs. He was glad to get away; wondered if he had been recognized by Lehming; hoped not. He had, he thought, discovered something, as for instance that the girl was probably in the house, and that one of the Wetherel set was there also, very likely watching over her. Well, he disappeared, to the great joy of Lehming for one instant and to his great terror in the next. Had the fellow gone to the police-office for a search warrant, and would he return immediately to take Nestoria to prison? Or had he only guessed at her hiding-place, so that for the next day or two they would see him lurking about the house in various unclean disguisesâthe ugly, stealthy, pitiless forerunner of the fate which he would be sure at last to bring? Dismayed and perplexed, Lehming stood for some time motionless, now hearkening to see if the boding step of the detective were not reascending the stairways, now cudgelling his meditative gentle soul in vain for some prompt stratagem whereby to deliver Nestoria, and meanwhile half wishing that he were a veteran criminal, so that he might know how to deal with this guilty and risky situation. He could not resolve to let the girl be seized, although that would have been the easiest step to take, and, as he keenly felt, the right step. She had quite mastered him. Her patience, her endurance, her heroic will, and, more than all else perhaps, her beauty and other graciousness, had made him her slave. Good and intelligent as he was, he had come to submit both his conscience and his judgment to her. He must help to hide her until she should be willing to hide no longer. But how should he save her from this new peril? If he told her that she was watched by a policeman, she would probably run away as soon as night fell; she would once more become a friendless waif on the great, pitiless ocean of life; she might sink under its billows into some undiscoverable cavern of ruin. He decided at last that he must act without consulting her, and force a rescue upon her before she could suspect and evade it. And hereupon his weakness in practical affairs showed itself; he found that he could not devise and execute unassisted. He could think of nothing better than to seek Mrs. Dinneford, reveal to her the whereabouts and the danger of Nestoria, and ask her help. On this errand he set forth, with the conscience and mien of a criminal, the most wretched good man in New York, if a good man he can be called. He quitted the tenement house by a back way, crossing a narrow yard full of rubbish and heaps of coal, forcing open with much difficulty the neglected gate of a partition fence, stealing with the air of a thief through a low grocery store, and tottering out upon a narrow and filthy alley. The Dinnefords he found packing up and preparing to leave New York for a season, in order to escape from Count Poloski's expected persecutions, and from the evil fame of that humiliating betrothal. His heart sank within him, for he inferred that they would not, and indeed could not, stay to aid him. Nevertheless, he thought it best to tell his tale. The two impulsive, warm-hearted women at once forgot themselves; they were so unselfish and noble that they brought the tears into the young man's eyes. âThank God!â exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford, half laughing and half sobbing. âThe lost sheep is found. Let us rejoice and make merry.â Then, turning anxiously to her daughter, âWhat will you do, Alice?â âI will stay here and cuddle Nestoria,â returned the girl, forgetful of her own troubles, excited, elated, and gay. âWalter, do hurry and bring her.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER L. HARK FROM THE TOMBS A DOLEFUL SOUND. IT was decided that Mrs. Dinneford should go with Lehming to find Nestoria, and furthermore that she should if possible bring the girl back to her own house, there to hide her until some wiser thing might be done. The difference between the expressions of these two as they set off on their errand was something very curious. Lehming, oppressed and cowed by the illegality of the adventure, had that stealthy, cast-down air which a good man cannot help wearing when his conscience troubles him. Mrs. Dinneford, on the contrary, although a thoroughly worthy and fervently well-meaning soul, felt no inward reprovings whatever. As is the case with most women, she had little respect for statutes and enactments in themselves, but only so far as they seemed in every special case to work sweetness and light, and wanted to evade them whenever they, in her opinion, wrought the contrary. If she realized at all that her errand was a law-breaking one, she cared little for it. The idea that she was flying to the rescue of a âlost lamb,â who had fallen into a pit of sorrows, occupied nearly the whole of her affectionate and impulsive spirit. So, while her honest face was excited and anxious, it was also eager and elated and cheerful. They left the house on foot, with the intention of taking a hack at a stand some distance away. But they had scarcely shut the door behind them when a breathless, ragged boy fluttered up the steps, holding forth a letter, which proved to be for Mrs. Dinneford. âIt is Cousin John's hand,â she said, as she broke open the dirty envelope, âand it is the very first note he ever wrote me in his life, and something outlandish must have happened. I do believe Emerson is dead or the sky has fallen.â She read, colored, laughed outright, and handed the billet to Lehming. âDear Coz,â it ran, âI am in durance vile. I regret to darken your mind with my calamity; but school keeps not to-day, and Walter is in no set place; a thousand boys would not find him. Some one who knows me must come to the Tombs and swear that I am a harmless philosopher and no midnight villain. Such is the charge against me, that I am a midnight villain. âYours in durance vile, âJohn Bowlder.â âWhat stupid blunder can this be?â exclaimed Lehming in great anxiety âHe says nothing about Nestoria; but she may be there nevertheless. We must go first to the Tombs,â he added, though mortally afraid of entering that reputed abode of justice. They walked on hurriedly, found a hack, and set off for the Tombs. Lehming was in a state of anxiety which amounted to anguish; his diseased heart throbbed so painfully that he could not talk. âTake courage, Walter,â said Mrs. Dinneford cheerfully. âThis looks to me like a providence. It comes at such a critical time that I cannot believe it to be anything less than an interposition of the Almighty finger. I trust that it happens for good, and to give us prosperity in our adventure. It is my nature to believe that an interference is always meant in mercy, until I find otherwise. We have few chastisements even which are not covert blessings. That wretched engagement, for instance; the presence of it was alarming and the departure humiliating; but I do entertain a hope that it has sobered Alice for good. She was always a child before, blowing soap-bubbles as it were out of the windows of life, and wondering that the passing realities should break them. But now she seems a woman. Didn't you observe something noble in her face and manner and thoughts this morning? I am so glad you saw it! She was willing in a moment to sacrifice her own plans and feelings for the sake of little, lovely Nestoria. Dear me! that poor childâthat wandering, hiding childâwhat do you suppose ails her? Is she crazy? Have terror and grief discomposed her intellect on one subject? I can't account for her conduct otherwise. Oh, what a mystery and labyrinth of darknesses this Wetherel affair, as they call it, has been. Well, we shall come to the issue of it some day, and find that every step of the tangled path was plain enough, only for the blindness of our finite sight. Both she and all of us have been guided from on high, and the Lord's guidance is always marvellous, though it end in a blessing.â âI do sincerely pray that it may end well,â sighed Lehming, whose mind and conscience were more instructed than Mrs. Dinneford's, and saw more sides to every moral question, and had thornier doubts. With a great tumping of heartsâbeating sullenly and bodefully, like the drums of an executionâthey presently pulled up before the Tombs. The famous headquarters of the New York correctional system, sombre enough by reason of its Egyptian architecture, and still more sombre because of its associations with crime and punishment, looked unusually lowering through a drizzling rain. âWait for me in the hack, and keep your face veiled,â whispered Lehming as he quitted Mrs. Dinneford. Then he went trembling up the granite steps and through a heavy, slamming door, which seemed to close upon him with a gripe. We have not time to describe the grimy, gloomy great rooms amid which he wandered, nor the lounging and pert or sullen officials who treated him with elaborate disrespect, really putting themselves to some trouble about it. At last he came to John Bowlder; and positively he did not know him. An officer had to clap the imprisoned philosopher on the shoulder and say, âHere is your man, sir,â before Lehming could recognize his old friend. It seemed as if an enchanter's wand must have been waved over Bowlder, or as if his soul had migrated into some new body. Where was the familiar rosy face, and where the confident eye and cheery smile? The poor man was as pale as a sheet, and was ready to sink on the dirty floor with fright, and had no more joy in his glance than a whipped dog. He was a transfigured creature in every way; there was nothing left of his usual bigness and bluffness and blowsiness; there was, so to speak, only a skeleton of the original Bowlder. He was under examination, it must be understood, and had been stripped of his outer clothing. To look at him now one would say that he must have been all outer clothing. The policemen had taken off two coats, two vests, two pairs of trousers, and more woollen undergarments than I dare tell of. At last they had peeled him down to his proper outlines in shirt and drawers; and such ontlines, so altered, so incredibly less, so diminished as if by vast distance! They hardly knew him themselves, and half thought they had begun with one man and finished with another, so marvellous had been the change. A clothes-stand, on which his removed raiment hung, looked much more like the real Bowlder than did this white taper of a figure. âAhâWalter!â exclaimed John, putting out a tremulous hand and seizing Lehming with the eagerness of a man who seeks to save himself from drowning. âHere you are at last. Here you are. I want you to bear witness that I am a good citizen. Tell these good people so. Tell them that I am not a midnight miscreant. They accuse me, as near as I can make out, of murdering our good old friend, Judge Wetherel. You know my innocence, Walter. Get a Bible and swear to it.â Even his conversation, stripped and divested as it was of transcendentalisms, was lean and shrunken. A man might have been pardoned for glancing at the clothes-stand to see if his accustomed phraseology had not been hung up along with his garments. Lehming was anxious to know if Nestoria had also been arrested, but he did not dare even to whisper this question in the presence of justice. So he simply turned to a policeman and inquired, âWhat is the meaning of this arrest?â âFound him in disguise, sir,â replied the policeman, who was a tall, powerful man of exceedingly combative aspect. âI'll tell you just how it was,â he added with an air of nonchalant condescension, as though he needn't tell if he didn't want to, and wouldn't have told if he hadn't felt good-natured. âI was passing along my beat in Fulton street, an' I saw this old feller wheelin' bricks with a lot of Irishmen, an' I knew the minute I laid eyes on him he wan't used to the business. He was a-totterin' around, you see, an' a-tippin' over his load and a-buckin into the other men, an' makin' a tinker's mess of it generally. Well, says I, that's comical, an' so I stopped a bit to watch him. I thought, of course, it was some dead beat who was tryin' to earn a dollar, and wan't in the habit of doin' it. But after a while he fell down over his barrow, an' a gold ticker flew out of his vest pocket, an' that on a gold chain, too. Well, says I, that's queerer than ever; that's a dân queer start, that is. You know you don't often see a man who wheels bricks sportin' a gold watch. I begun to think here was a case. How did a dead beat come by so much jewelry an' bullion? That's the question. So I staid by an' kept my eye on him. Well, next thing, a gentleman come along who is in our line, an' I pinted out this man to him, an' he inspected him a while, an' finally remembered him. Says he to me, That feller, says he, was up at New Haven time of the Wetherel murder; he was a hangin' about the house, says he, at the very time; I'll bet on him, says he. Well, that was a big thing, you know, that Wetherel murder, an' one of our men has been a-workin' it up ever since, an' wants all the items he can pick up. So I steps up to our friend here, an' says to him in substance, Come along with me. Then he sassed me, an' I took him in charge. Well, here he isâlook at him yourselfâdisguised up to his earsâ a little man dressed to look like a big one. We've took off more things from him than would clothe an almshouse. Just roll your eye around that haystack of coats an' trousers over there. Don't it look queer? I leave it to yourself. Well, that's the story of the arrest; an' now, if there's anythin' to say on the other side, I shall be glad to hear it; for we don't want to bother no innocent man; of course we don't.â During this tale John Bowlder had repeatedly attempted to introduce corrections, saying in a humble, placating voice, âMy friend,â but falling extinct under the strong utterance of the âstar.â âMy friend,â he now began againââmy official and much respected friend, you are very right in the main. But allow me, my friend, a word of explanation to my friend Lehming. I will tell you, Walter, how I came into this scrape. I had a desire to know by experience the pains and joys of the sons of toil. That is the reason why I sought a job at wheeling bricks. The agreement was a dollar for a day. The remuneration was low because I honestly avowed that I was a green hand at the bellows of labor. I did not wheel well; I admit it, my official friend; but I wheeled the best I could. Even my official friend here must concede that I wheeled zealously.â âOh, of course,â nodded the policeman impatiently. âBut that's all poppycock, an' has nothin' to do with the case. I didn't arrest you for bad wheelin'. You was a suspicious feller, an' you sassed me.â âYes, my official friend. I will confess somewhat of guilt in the matter of sauce,â replied Bowlder. âI did call you a minion. The term is not savory; at least it is often used in an uncomplimentary sense; and I withdraw it.â âWell, now about the gold watch, an' the extry coats an' britches?â continued the star, anxious to come to the main point. âWho are you, anyway? Does this man,â turning to Lehming, âknow you?â Of course Lehming declared that he was acquainted with Mr. Bowlder, and could bear witness to his entire respectability. âBut who are you?â persisted the officer, too clever to believe all he heard. âLook here, I can't let this man go so easy as that, you know. He'll have to wait here till we can send for the gentleman that's working up this Wetherel case. I say, Bill,â he called to a brother minister of justice, âtell some of them messengers that Sweet is wanted.â âYou'll have to loaf round a spell,â answered the brother minister of justice with haughty indifference. âJim is out on a circuit, an' it won't be easy to find him.â âOh, I know his hole,â said the first minister. And in a hoarse whisper he named a grocery which stood directly opposite Lehming's lodgings. So Jim was sent for. But presently Wolverton strolled in, also in search of Sweet, whom he wanted to see about Poloski. And now deliverance came to John Bowlder, for Wolverton was known to several of the officials, and his declaration as to the philosopher's respectability was accepted. âDress as quickly as possible,â urged Lehming. âI have a hack here and will take you home.â âWalter, I will dress quickly,â snuffled Bowlder, who already had a cold in the head. âBut I must go back to my wheeling. I want to clear my character with those sons of toil who saw that minion take me into custody. Furthermore, I want to earn that dollar. It is my shamefaced impression that I never earned a dollar in my life. It is a sensation that I eagerly long for, as Galahad longed for a sight of the Holy Grail; and I cannot be balked in my search for it now that I am so near the goal. Go you, and ride in your luxurious hack; and if you took it on my account, charge it to me. I will devote my dollar to paying for it.â He had begun to recover his spirits, and also a tag or two of his transcendent phraseology. Indeed, by the time that he had got on his first layer of outer clothing, he broke out reciting, or perhaps improvising, some of his wonderful verses, chanting them as usual to the tune that the cow died of. Lehming hurried to his hack, directed his Jehu whither to drive next, and told Mrs. Dinneford the tale of Bowlder's arrest. Worried and eager as she was concerning the affair of Nestoria, the cheerful woman burst into one of her hearty fits of laughter. âPoor, good, foolish John!â she said. âI wonder what he was meant to do in this world. It does seem as if half the people we know ought to have been born in the moon.â âBut I told you, Walter, that this was a providence,â she presently added with gravity. âYou say that man Sweet was sent for. We shall be free to make our exits and entrances without a spy over us.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âDear Coz,â it ran, âI am in durance vile. I regret to darken your mind with my calamity; but school keeps not to-day, and Walter is in no set place; a thousand boys would not find him. Some one who knows me must come to the Tombs and swear that I am a harmless philosopher and no midnight villain. Such is the charge against me, that I am a midnight villain. âYours in durance vile, âJohn Bowlder.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LI. WILL SHE ESCAPE? Mrs. Dinneford's lively trust in Providence was not misplaced, nor her interpretation of its immediate purposes erroneous. Detective Sweet had really been summoned away from his ambuscade in front of the tenement house, and in fact Lehming caught a rear view of him, trudging in disguise, and through indirect streets, toward the Tombs. Of course this was an emboldening spectacle; nothing heartens even a brave soldier like seeing the enemy in full retreat; and this excellent young man with a guilty conscience greatly needed cheering. He did not, however, neglect any precaution against discovery. He halted his hack in the back alley, and manÅuvred Mrs. Dinneford through the grocery and the courtyard, precisely as if Sweet were still at his post. âDear me, Walter! one might think we were doing something wrong,â whispered that lady, with the adorable simplicity of a worthy soul which is accustomed to judge its actions by its motives. Lehming envied her uninstructed conscience, and marvelled over it. He had told her repeatedly that this thing which they were doing was illegal and perilous, without apparently gaining a spark of credence or rousing a throb of fear. She knew that she was right because her heart blazed up with love, pity, and other praiseworthy emotions, diffusing such a thick smoke of sweet incense that she could not see the solemn, inquisitorial figures of law and justice. Without pausing to reason further with so convinced a spirit, Lehming led the way into the grim old tenement and panted up the long stairways. The door of his study was open, but the room was empty. âI will place you in this ambush,â he said to Mrs. Dinneford, pointing out the closet which had once sheltered Nestoria from Edward Wetherel. âThen I will bring her in here and you shall step out upon her. It is dreadful and most degrading,â he added with a groan, âto be obliged to resort to such deceptions.â âDreadful?â stared the worthy woman. âWhy, Walter, it is all for the best, I am sure.â And then, without further unnecessary justification of righteousness, she rustled into the closet and seated herself cosily in the time-worn chair which still stood there. Falstaff, taking refuge behind the arras from his creditors, and snoring the snore of the upright, carried with him no quieter conscience. Lehming now went out softly, as wicked men are fallaciously supposed to walk, and as good men do walk when they are doubtful of their courses. He came to Nestoria's door; there for a moment he paused, pressing his hand upon that complaining, threatening heart of his; at last he mustered resolution to tap upon the fateful panel. He heard a chair scrape on the bare floor within, and knew that the little artist was rising from her work-table, and thought with compunction how trustfully she would open to him. Next there was the sound of a bolt slipping back, and then Nestoria stepped briskly out with a smile. She was a beautiful object in his eyes, and she would have been beautiful, I doubt not, in the eyes of any man, or even of any woman. We must remember her childlike figure, not merely as small but also as plump as childhood, a figure like a cherub only half grown to be a seraph. This solidly graceful young woman, notwithstanding months of anxiety, was now in the richest health. She seemed able yet to endure anything that the youth of âteensâ can endure. Her carnelian face was roseate; her locks of living sunlight were exuberant; her blue eyes were as clear as gems. There was something fascinating in her candid manner and in her singularly fearless pose. She stood square on both feet, her form perfectly erect and her head thrown a little back. This position was habitual with her, and very naturally so. She was so much shorter than most people, so much below the stature even of most women, that she usually had to look up in order to see faces; and furthermore, it was a characteristic of her confiding and brave nature that she hardly ever spoke to any one without looking him or her full in the eyes; so that this little head had learned to take and keep an upright carriage. Such a bearing would have made a tall woman appear haughty and domineering; but in this petite creature it only added to her air of innocence, of trustfulness, of appealing for protection. âWhat is it, Mr. Lehming?â she asked in her frank, brief, practical way, at the same time giving him the confiding smile of an infant. His heart suddenly faced about and stepped into the paths of sincerity. He had meant to inveigle the girl unawares into a meeting with Mrs. Dinneford. But, loving her as he did, he could not look into those trustful eyes and keep his Jesuitical purpose. âMy dear child, it is a great deal,â he said gently. âI have discovered that this house is watchedâat least so I believeâby a detective. I decided that you must go otherwheres. The best friend that you have in this whole land is Mrs. Dinneford. I went to her. She is here, hiding in the closet in my room, for I am sorry to say that I did mean to deceive you, meaning your good. She is here to take you away. Will you see her?â Nestoria turned pale, but her eyes retained their thoughtful composure, and she seemed entirely self-possessed. âHave you told her about me?â she whispered. âHave you told her all that you know?â âYes.â he bowed meekly, not even asking forgiveness, he thought himself so unworthy of it. She bent her head a moment, just a moment, in meditation; then she looked up at him with a smile of assent, satisfaction, and pardon. In the next breath she left him, walked with her usual firm, brisk step toward the study, entered it, face toward the closet, and said, âMrs. Dinneford, you may come out.â The good lady opened the door of her hiding-place, saw Nestoria smiling at her, flew to her like a tempest, clasped her in her arms, and cried with joy. When the two women drew back to look at each other, both their faces were quivering with emotion and wet with tears, although the younger one had not uttered a sob. âOh, my dear little lost lamb!â exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford. âHow you have borne and how you can bear! You are not changed a particle. You have been in the furnace, and the smell of fire is not upon you.â âI have learned to bear,â sighed Nestoria, her voice shaking a little. âBut do not let us talk of itâat least not now.â âNo; there is no time for it,â struck in Lehming. âMiss Bernard, how soon can you get away?â âIn five minutes,â she replied. âLeave the key of your room with me,â he said. âI will see that your baggage is packed and sent after you.â âIt is all packed but my brushes and colors,â she smiled. âI have lived packed. In a minute I will bring out my carpet-bag.â âI am so glad we brought your trunk to New York!â almost whimpered Mrs. Dinneford, glancing pitifully at the girl's one well-worn dress. âYou will find all your nice things at our house.â âCome with me while I put on my bonnet and shawl,â nodded Nestoria, as tranquilly as if she were about to prepare for a quiet promenade in open day. Mrs. Dinneford followed this strange young heroine into her box of a room, and looked about it with moist eyes. There was the ugly, hired iron bedstead, the coarse, hired bedding, a single cherry chair, a small whitewood table, a washstand almost bald of varnish, no carpet, not a curtain, not a decoration of any sort, not a knicknack, none of those delicate comforts or small, gracious objects with which women love to surround themselves. For three months or so the girl had not expended one penny which had not been absolutely necessary to her mere existence. A few minute crumbs of sea biscuit on the mantelpiece showed what had been her nourishment that morning. Mrs. Dinneford surveyed this confession of poverty, thought of the anxieties and sorrows under which it had doubtless been endured, and then looked with wonder at Nestoria's fresh cheeks and vigorous movements. âWhat a marvel of health and strength you are!â she murmured with something like awe. âYes,â was the quiet reply. âI have been favored more than I deserve.â âMay the Lord sunder this sea of mystery,â prayed Mrs. Dinneford, âand lead us all through it in peace, and restore you to your uses in life!â Instantancously startled and deeply moved by this impulsive petition, Nestoria for a moment covered her face with her hands and sobbed aloud. Immediately recovering herself, however, she put on her well-worn hat and coarse shawl, picked up her carpet-bag, and walked into the entry. Lehming was waiting there, meanwhile looking over the banisters. âI owe for the rest of the month on the room and furniture,â she said to him, producing her purse. âWill you take the money?â âTime presses,â he replied. âI will pay the bills and settle with you later.â With that singular frankness which lay at the root of her character, and which still lived there in spite of months of concealment, she was about to descend the front stairway. âNot that way,â called Lehming, at the same time seizing her carpet-bag. âWe must use caution to-day.â In two minutes more they had reached the back alley, and were driving rapidly away in their hack, the windows up and curtains drawn. Once Lehming peeped out and beheld something which showed the value of minutes; he discovered detective Sweet hurrying back to his post, accompanied by a policeman. âI fear that a search warrant has been issued,â he said. âWell, we have the start, and New York is a wilderness, and our police is incapable. No one has seen us but the coachman. The keeper of the grocery must have been out.â âI heard him in his cellar,â remarked Nestoria. âHe was just going down stairs as we entered.â âWe are surely in the right way,â commented Mrs. Dinneford, with honest though perhaps erroneous thankfulness. âThe finger of Providence aids us at every step. It is a pillar of cloud behind us. But, Walter, what will you do when they come to you?â âI shall say to them: There is the room; search it.â âOh, how much trouble and perplexity I bring to you!â groaned Nestoria. âWell, some dayâyes, some dayâI will speak.â There was not much said during the drive; they were too anxious to talk even of their anxieties. Once only Nestoria spoke, saying with a sigh, âPoor Imogen! She will be lonely, I am afraid. I wish I could have bidden her good by. What a life!â âIt will end one happy day, one unexpected day,â replied Lehming. âDeliverance, like calamity, often comes by surprise.â âWhere are we going?â Mrs. Dinneford asked, seeing that they had passed the street leading to her house. âTo the New Haven railroad station,â explained Lehming. âWe must throw this coachman off the trail.â On reaching the station (the old one on Twenty-seventh street) they discharged the hack and entered the station. Lehming bought three tickets to Boston, showed the ladies into a train which was about starting, helped them out on the opposite side of the enclosure, led them through the long shed which opened on Madison avenue, and there took another carriage. Descending from this at a corner near the Dinneford house, they waited until it had disappeared, and then walked to their refuge. Entering quietly by means of a pass key, Nestoria was hurried up stairs to her bedroom, there to find a memento of Sea Lodge, her trunk. âNow dress yourself, dear, and don't cry!â exhorted Mrs. Dinneford, throwing herself into a chair and wiping her eyes. âI know the sight of the old things will give you a turn. But you must put on some different clothes. It will be impossible to hide you from the servants, you know; and you must not look strange to them. They are curious enough when there's nothing to call for it. By the way, what a providence it was that we changed our help when we left Brooklyn. If we had kept the old set that Cousin Wetherel thought so much of, and used to discourse and expound to as though it was a congregation, we couldn't have brought you here on the spur of the moment. They would have known you at the first glimpse, they thought so much of you and mourned so about you. You remember old Sarah, with the loose eyes that looked as though they had been dropped out and put back again. Well, Sarah is keeping an intelligence office; she thought she could do better that way, and it would be easier for her; and I knew it would be easier for me, for she had got very slatternly. But what am I talking to you about Sarah for? What's Hecuba to you? as Hamlet says, or something like it. I wonder where Alice is? I thought surely she would be here, ready to eat you alive. But perhaps she has run out to buy something that she thinks you will want. Or perhaps she got frightened about us, we were gone so much longer than we expected, and went to look for us. You know we women can't sit still when the waves roll over us; it is so at the bathing places, and so everywhere; we must jump and scream. But you are different. What a wonder you are, to be sure, unlocking your trunk with that steady hand! I wish there were more women like you. The sex might be fit to vote then. Not that I want to vote any more than I want to whistle. Dear me, what talk this is! How my mind does canter about, like a colt in a pasture! Do let me help you on with that prettyââ At this moment there was a tap at the door, rousing visions of detectives and policemen. âWho is it?â demanded Mrs. Dinneford, seizing the key with one hand and the bolt with the other, as if she really meant to shut out the law.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LII. HIDING, WATCHING, AND HALF DISCERNING. âIt is Iâlet me in,â called the voice of Alice Dinneford through the keyhole. âI have been shopping for her. Let me in.â âOh, you child, how you scared me!â exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford. Opening the door, she admitted a bounding, laughing young lady, who showed in her countenance not a trace of her late disappointment in love matters, who had forgotten completely the adventure of losing Count Poloski in the new adventure of recovering Nestoria, and who bore in her hand, of all winter presents in the world, a gorgeous fan! âOh, you darling!â she cried, embracing the restored pet. âOh, you precious little speck of a thing! I had forgotten how little you were. And your hair is lovelier than ever,â she went on fingering it. âThere, there is your present of welcome,â she laughed, brandishing the fan. âIsn't it sweet?â âI painted it myself,â quietly responded Nestoria, after one glance at the gewgaw. âI am glad you picked it out for me. It seems as if you were led to remember me in a strange way. But how good of you to think of buying anything for me! Dear Alice, I thank you.â âLife is just as full of special providences as it can stick,â observed the wondering Mrs. Dinneford. âIt is splendid with them, like a bird with featlers. How beautiful and charitable it was of our Heavenly Father to guide Alice, all unwitting of what she did, to buy a piece of your own handiwork as the fittest and loveliest gift she could find for you! As Tupper says, Is it not also His doing when an aphis creepeth on a rosebud?â Meantime the process of attiring continued. When it was finished, and Nestoria stood up fresh and trim in an unworn dress, with its suitable adornments, she had gained in beauty. No wonder that women are dandies and love fine raiment; the dreariest economist must admit that it is becoming. Even Nestoria, almost an inhabitant of other worlds by reason of sorrows and concealments, remained so far human as that she could discern how much finer she was because of finer apparel. As she turned from the glass to her two friends there was an arch smile on her lips, which was partly a confession of satisfaction with her own appearance, and partly a grateful response to their looks of admiration. In truth they were inexpressibly exultant over their renovated seraph. Mrs. Dinneford wanted to pick the girl up, and kiss her in her arms like an infant. Alice fluttered around her as a butterfly flutters around a flower. Loving hands pulled and straightened the serious little alpaca skirt, and decked its puritanism with sash, ribbons, and other dashes of relieving finery. At last they all sat down, wearied with their excitements, and loved each other in quiet. But silence could not long prevail in a heaven upon earth populated mainly by Dinnefords. Alice, a most curious young woman, and violently interested in mysteries, was wild to hear Nestoria's story. After looking at her with eager eyes for a few seconds, she broke out with, âAnd now tell us all about it. Do! You would feel so much better for telling us all about it!â âNo,â interposed Mrs. Dinneford, as inquisitive as her daughter, but able through riper years to summon up some forbearance. âWhen Nestoria's conscience tells her to speak, she will do so. Until then we will wait.â âYou are very noble, Mrs. Dinneford,â replied the girl, her eyes filling with sparkles of gratitude. âIt seems to me of late that everybody is sublimely good or sublimely wicked. I never imagined human nature in such strong lights as I have seen it in during the last three months. Once I thought there were few passions and no mysteries. Now everybody is terrible in my eyes; everybody is capable of something fearful. It is a very different world, and a much more awful world than I believed it.â âNestoria, how you have grown!â stared Alice. âWell, I have had to grow myself,â she added with a sigh, remembering the Poloski folly. âI will tell you about it some day. But it's horrid, this growing.â âWe will call you Nettie,â said Mrs. Dinneford. âYou shall be Miss Nettie, and nothing more. If you will keep within doors, or wear a deep veil when you do go out, you will not be noticed, I hope. Walter thinks that the police will hardly take it into their wooden heads to look for you here.â âThese concealments!â sighed Nestoria. âOh, these concealments! Well, I have almost done with them. If light does not come of itself soon, I will let it. I think I can promise you that I shall soon be able to force myself to speak. In a month, at the longest. Yes, in a month.â A woful tremor crisped the faces of all three women. Both Mrs. Dinneford and Alice said in their hearts that, when their guest should break silence concerning the Wetherel affair, it would be to denounce Edward Wetherel as the assassin of his uncle, or at least as privy to the assassination. No, it is not quite true that they said it; the thing seemed to be whispered to them, as by some goblin; and they, on their parts, strove hard to close their ears against the horrible suggestion. Thus commenced Nestoria's life in the Dinneford house. It was a life of seclusion; she passed most of her time in her own room, painting, or reading, or chatting with her hosts; she hardly ever sat, even for a moment, in the parlor, and never went out except by evening. The servants knew no more of her than that here was a guest. It is reasonable to suppose that Lehming was the only person outside of the family who was aware of the girl's retreat. By the way, this gentle creature, unfitted through fragile health to cope with assailant fellow men of a rude and hearty morale, was graciously spared all difficulties with Mr. Sweet. The detective did indeed search Nestoria's abandoned room, and was exceedingly miffed, even to blasphemy, at not finding her. But he was a dullish man, as has perhaps already been made apparent; he was no bloodhound, but rather a bulldog, with a poor nose for a scent. He went at Imogen Eleonore about her missing friend with such petulant vim that she became more jealous than ever, and would not tell him what little she did know concerning Nettie Fulton. Then he quarrelled with her, threatened her vaguely with the law, lost her confidence, scared her, set her a-crying, and in short dampened his own train of powder, and lost all present chance of blasting open the Wetherel mystery. Strong and coarse, he undertook to drive a woman, and almost of necessity failed. You can't drive a woman any more than you can drive a hen. She is too suspicious, timorous, hysterical, and when desperate, too wild. This way she dodges and that way she flutters, now making a rush between your legs, and then cut-cut-ca-da-cut over your shoulder, and away cackling into some untraversable puddle, where she is badly off, to be sure, but you don't want to chase her. Well, Mr. Sweet was so bewildered by Imogen Eleonore's spasmodic ignorance and paroxysmal denials that he lost his faith in this Nettie Fulton as a key to his âcase,â and decided that he had wasted his valuable time in watching the tenement-house. So, feeling that he had been somewhat ridiculous, and not wishing to âmake a cussed ass of himselfâ any further, he forbore from catechising Lehming, and in fact kept out of his way. Imogen Eleonore, we may as well add, he wrathfully abandoned and left in uncourted desolation. One word of explanation here concerning detectives. It may be imagined by some persons that I do injustice to this noble caste by presenting Mr. Sweet as an example of their abilities. I modestly but firmly, and sorrowfully also, believe the contrary. I believe that American detectives, and especially those of New York city, are usually models either of eminent dishonesty or of eminent incapacity. Just consider the vast morasses and Pontine marshes of undrained, uncleared crime, which send up their horrible malaria on the island of Manhattan. Look at the Nathan murder and the long series of other murders which are set down as so much âdead stockâ on the police books of that single municipality. Our assassins and burglars are seemingly under as little restraint as if they were a legalized class, the representatives of a âvested interest,â or an exceptional judicature like the Holy Inquisition. Men whose every footstep leaves a trace of blood, and from whose pockets drop stolen bonds and greenbacks, walk under the noses of the men whose business it is to see them and catch them, with an insolent impunity which is enough to drive industry to other shores and make us rue our freedom. Of course the fault in the matter rests on loftier heads than those of Mr. Sweet and his comrades. A people which suffers itself to be ruled politically by its non-taxpayers, and which degrades its judiciary by making it look for power and honor to ward meetings and other similar sources of popular favorâsuch a people must necessarily have inferior magistrates and officers of justice, from the highest to the lowest. From this festering subject (which lends, by the way, a groundwork of probability and even of naturalness to our story) we must return to Nestoria. She had not been a day in her new refuge before she had heard the tale of Alice's broken engagement. That frank and sociable sufferer could not dam up her woes and mortifications. On the first opportunity she talked them out as freely as a swollen brook babbles forth its unaccustomed foam and âriliness.â So Nestoria knew all about Count Poloski, and held him in fear and abomination. She had disagreeable impressions even of his personal appearance. In spite of Alice's declaration that the man was slender, and blond, handsome, she pictured him as a stalwart creature of dark, saturnine, and forbidding aspect. It must be remembered that she had seen him but once, and then only at a considerable distance and by moonlight. On the night when she had met Edward Wethere upon the beach near Sea Lodge, the Count had been merely a black line rising from a dim profile of hillock against a background of moonlit cloud. She learned that he was in the habit of passing the house frequently, on the lookout, as it was supposed, for Alice. One lonesome day, while the Dinnefords were out on one of those shopping ebullitions which serve to our ladies in place of the Eleusinian mysteries, or the weeping for Tammuz, Nestoria placed herself at a window in the parlor and watched the passers by, wondering whether she would recognize the discarded lover if she should see him. Unknown to her the chambermaid was polishing the door-plate and the door was open. The Count, who happened to be close at hand, bounded up the steps behind the woman, and, in spite of her hasty remonstrance, forced an entrance. Nestoria, gazing just then in another direction, did not witness this adroit and sudden escalade. The opening of a door and the sound of a footstep in the parlor were her first intimations that a stranger was near her. She turned with a start of terror, and probably with an intent to fly; but the moment she looked in the visitor's face she seemed to be fascinated; she stood stock still, pale, silent, and staring. Poloski did not know who she was, and at first took little note of her; he just glanced at her, and then glared about the room eagerly, undoubtedly seeking for Alice. His lost betrothed being nowhere visible, he turned once more toward Nestoria, and then he seemed to observe the strange way in which she gazed at him, for his eyes opened with an expression of wonder and mistrust. âI beg your pardon, miss,â he said, bowing civilly. âI regret that I have alarmed you by my intrusion. May I ask if Miss Dinneford is at home?â Nestoria did not answer, and continued to stare at him. She was evidently agitated by violent and conflicting emotions, and her appearance was very singular, startling, and even imposing. Her eyes were dilated and flashing; her face changed rapidly from white to crimson, and back again; her very neck was blotched with crimson spots and streakings; all the blood in her veins was in wild tumult. âI demand to see Miss Dinneford,â resumed Poloski, evidently somewhat confounded by this odd reception, but nevertheless resolved to carry his point if possible. âWho are you?â asked Nestoria. Her utterance was as strange and abnormal as her silence. The voice was not like hers; it was unnaturally harsh, strident, and abrupt; it seemed to burst violently through choking obstacles. âI am Count Poloski, at your service,â replied the visitor, not forgetting his habitual civilities, though he was broadly amazed. âOh!â gasped Nestoria in such a tone as rarely quivers through human speech, however often it may be heard in worlds of vaster emotions than ours. She was conscious of dizziness, of a humming and whirling of the whole room, of some one departing in a rapid, ghostly, inaudible way, and then of nothing more. The shock of a great hope, following on the shock of a great terror, had been more than she could bear without swooning. When she recovered her senses, she found herself laid upon a sofa, with the chambermaid putting water to her lips, and no one else present. âWas that Count Poloski?â were her first words, uttered in a faint voice, but very eagerly. âWhy didn't you call the police?â The girl, who knew nothing against the Count except that he had been denied the house, stared in confusion and mumbled some vague excuses. âNever mind,â continued Nestoria. âI think I am well now. Help me to my room.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LIII. THE WETHEREL WILL FOR SALE. TWO or three days previous to Nestoria's adventure with Count Poloski, Walter Lehming had received a startling visit from Edward Wetherel. The usually collected and serious, if not downright sombre young man was in a state of eager and cheerful exhilaration; he came running up Lehming's stairway, rushed into his study without knocking, and tossed a billet to him with the words, âRead that.â Walter glanced over the bit of manuscript, and saw that it was an anonymous letter addressed to Mr. Edward Wetherel, the writing in the fashion of print, and the signature âDarkness.â âThe will exists,â he read. âIt cuts you off with a shilling. You can have it, if you will pay one hundred thousand dollars; otherwise it will be offered to the other heirs, who will be sure to take it. If you accept, put an advertisement in the `Herald,' saying, Terms agreeable, and signing your name. Then I will instruct you how to open further communication with me.â As Lehming read, his long, sallow, homely, but sweet face flushed deeply, and when he had finished he looked up at Edward with an expression of deep joy, a joy which he might not fully explain. If the letter were honest, if Edward had not fabricated it himself (and Lehming did not think of that immediately), then it appeared certain that the murderer of Judge Wetherel was some commonplace, mercenary ruffian, and that this young man here present, this connection and friend, was innocent. âHere we have the assassin!â exclaimed Wetherel, pacing the room excitedly and with countenance uplifted. âHere we have the bloody hand showing itself. The question is how to seize it.â âWonderful!â replied Lehming, with an intonation of profound gratitude. âBut what is to be done?â âI cannot pay this money,â continued Wetherel, halting with the bended head and folded arms of reflection. âI am not the heir, if this document is found; no, nor in any case. But I think myself justified in promising it. Are we bound to keep the truth with murderers? Just think how easily this wretch has baffled justice thus far. The authorities of Connecticut gave up the search for him long ago, and I suppose wisely; the criminal was no doubt beyond their jurisdiction before his crime was a day old. He came to New York at once; he came instantly and instinctively to this sink of undisturbed lawlessness; this letter proves almost positively that he is here to-day, and he has probably been here all the while. Yet for three months our forceâas the police weakness sarcastically calls itselfâhas been pursuing him, or making a show of pursuit. For three months I have been urging and bribing our detectives and patrols to keep up the chase. Not a word have the drones, or idiots, or scoundrels brought me that has been worthy of attention.â âYou speak very strongly,â said Lehming. âHowever, considering what you have suffered, I don't wonder. Any man in your situation would suspect a thousand thingsââ âYes, I do speak strongly,â interrupted Wetherel. âI am embittered and enraged. I sometimes think that half our organization of justice, from the highest officials to the lowest, is in league with crime, or afraid of it. Just look at the way things go in this single matter of homicide. No murderer is ever found out who shows forethought in his sin, or common prudence in hiding himself. And when a man is caught red-handed, he is not promptly and honestly tried, or he is not punished. There are nearly thirty assassins in our jails now, whom the law apparently dares not lay hands on, or covertly desires to save. It is uncivilized, horrible to all upright souls, terrifying to all good citizens. There is a paralysis of justice and of public morality. The individual is left unprotected; he must defend himself from crime by his own strength and cunning; he must do as he would in Calabria or the Isle of Murderers. He cannot afford scruples in dealing with the criminal classes. Much as I hate and despise deception, I must personally tell this villain a lie, and perhaps many lies, in the hope of entrapping him. I dare not intrust the work to any one else, for fear that it will not be done faithfully and rightly, or not done at all. All my confidence in the ability or the purity of our correctional system is gone. Besides, whatever else may happen, I must clear my own name. I must!â he added, with a passion of utterance which revealed long and acute suffering under the imputation of guilt. âDo as you must,â said Lehming, after a pause of painful deliberation, for any and every fashion of falsehood was hateful to him. âWhen you have learned more, let me know if I can help you.â So, under the pressure of what seemed relentless necessity, an advertisement of âwords deceivingâ was inserted in the âHerald,â informing âDarknessâ that his terms were agreeable. Then came another letter; it offered a meeting, but not with Wetherel; some less formidable messenger must be sent, bearing the money; the place indicated was a wharf near the Battery, and the hour three in the morning. âI will go,â volunteered Lehming, after Edward had read the note to him. âBut what about the filthy lucre? What sort of ghost or simulacrum of it can I carry? I must have something to hold in my hands while I talk with this wretch and try to divine who he is.â âCounterfeit bills would answer best,â muttered Edward. âThey could be got from the police for this purpose. But it is horrible pitch to touch for any purpose.â âLet me have a simple package of waste paper,â said Lehming. âI can do something with it. I can at least make sure that there is a man at the end of this mysterious correspondence. Besides, there are possibilities. Chance may favor me. I may recognize him, may follow him, may bring about an arrest. Of course I can do nothing in the way of seizing him myself. You know I can neither fight nor run. But Providence may help. At the very least something will be gained. I shall be able to testify to a fact which will go to showâyour innocence.â âTo think that it should need showing!â groaned Wetherel. âBut I thank you. Only, do you consider that you risk violence? This may be a mere trick to delude a man with money about him into a place where he can be waylaid. This fellow, too, when he finds that the package is a fraud, may assault you.â âI will leave my watch and wallet at home,â replied Lehming. âAs for my poor little carcass, it is not of much account, and I will risk it. Some one must go.â So Lehming went, enveloped in an old loose cloak, and carrying under it a large sealed package, which had such a preposterously overt air of shamming great value that he was more than once tempted to throw it away. He started at two in the morning, for he had of course decided that he must go on foot to the rendezvous, and the preliminary throbbing of his anxious heart told him that he would not be able to walk fast. The streets were deserted, even brawlers and drunkards having sought refuge within doors from the keen December air; and as he looked up and down the long avenues of silence, bordered by monstrous walls which threw out not a gleam of light, he had an impression as if he were traversing a necropolis. The only persons whom he met were two or three isolated and nomadic policemen, who seemed to be engaged in trying doors to see if they were locked. âI am doing their work for them,â he thought somewhat bitterly, and passed them by without asking for their assistance. By times his mind leaped forward to the interview which awaited him, and sought to fashion it into some shape which would be manageable to his powers. His vivid imagination enabled him to struggle painfully with incidents which had not yet happened, and to take anxious part in a dialogue which might never be spoken. He was in the condition of a man who plays a game of chess in his thoughts, striving to arrange an interminable series of moves in such a fashion as to make them sure of success against every imaginable counterplay, and fighting with an adversary who has even the unknown to aid him, but who yet must be beaten. His game worked badly; he was not fitted for the fencing of intrigue and for encounters with ruffians; and, knowing his own weakness in such matters, he could not fancy himself as getting the better of his antagonist. His supposititious controversies with the mysterious villain of the Battery all ended, no matter how often he recommenced them and how eagerly he bent his mind to them, in discomfiture. The incognito wormed out secrets and divulged none; he secured the sealed package and discovered it to be a sham; he failed to exhibit the will, and successfully hid his guilty visage. Wearied at last with these confusing and disheartening forereachings, Lehming struggled to clear his brain of them and to trust that the trial would bring him inspiration. âI will do the best I can,â he murmured. âAnd may Heaven help me, as it sometimes does help the foolish.â Then another troublous subject gradually invaded his mind, like a tide stealing over a low and dikeless land, driving out of it all present life and confirming the future as a waste. He was engaged in an enterprise which, if completely successful, would prove the innocence of Edward Wetherel; and one result, one morally certain result, of such a rehabilitation would be to give Nestoria back to her betrothed lover. He himself felt sure of it, and that surety was a dagger to him. He knew now, if he had never known it before, that he loved the girl with all his heart and mind and strength. She had never yet seemed to him, and indeed we might also say that she had never really been, so beautiful, so sweet in her ways, so noble and pure and altogether charming, as she appeared to his imagination in this momentous hour when he was doing his feeble best to hand her over to another. He remembered her smileâthat tender starlight sparkle which had so often transmitted to him messages of gratitude and friendship, and which had sometimes lighted up the dusky abysses of his humility with glimmers of trembling hope. He recalled her various expressions, her thoughtful face, her sorrowful face, her face of cheer, her rare face of gayety, all her faces, all familiar to his soul, all capable of appearing before his mind's eye at an instant's summons, or without a summons. His meditations concerning her were not philosophical, nor hardly intelligent. They were vision and emotion; he saw and felt, rather than thought. It was a farewell. He gave her up; he sacrificed himself, as he was accustomed to do; he walked onward the quicker in order to hasten the sacrifice. It was a most sorrowful struggle, and every moment or two his eyes took desperate flights toward heaven in search of strength to bear it, dropping back wearily to earth with no other help than a suffering sense of resignation. An angel passing by might have seen a human dwarf striving to rejoice in the hope that he was working out good and happiness for others, and meanwhile wiping the tears from his cheeks. In this dolorous and sublime hour of renunciation he would not forbid himself tears. He must have that feeble consolation, and he felt that he was worthy of it. It was surely not much to obtain, but he thanked God for it, so humble was he. âOh, merciful Father,â he whispered, âthanks, thanks, for tears!â Perhaps a man is never so worthy of a woman as when, for her betterment and in spite of the pleadings of his heart, he resigns her to another. The very grief and meekness with which he lets go all claim to her brings him near to that divine ideal of love which renders all and requires nothing. Lehming, always purer of egoism than most human beings, was just now nearly fit, one may dare to say, for translation. Meanwhile his thoughts devoured the long way, as if they had been a chariot of fire; and of a sudden he was surprised by discovering that he had reached the Battery. The dark open space, snowless as yet and lighted by few lamps, its apparent size increased by the breadth of the invisible river behind it, seemed to him at first a daunting desert to approach. He paused a moment, wondered whether he should be waylaid, and then once more set forward steadfastly. Reaching the iron fence which then surrounded the Battery, and which by night was closed to prevent scenes of disorder and dramas of crime, he turned to the right and soon found the place of rendezvous. It was a small open wharf, bare at the time of all lumbering of merchandise, and of course jutting out into the sombre expanse of the North river. As he glanced along its dim edge, feebly illuminated by a single lamp, he could at first see nothing but ghostly outlines of shipping in the stream and a few distant lurid gleams which indicated the position of Jersey City. âThis man means to sail to-morrow for Europe,â he said to himself as he halted. âBut will he come?â Yes, he had come; there was a figure lying on the extreme verge of the wharf; and, as Lehming approached, it rose to an erect position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LIV. THE MASK TORN OFF. The man who rose from the edge of the wharf to meet Lehming was wrapped in a long, loose overcoat, furnished with a hood or capote which covered his head and shadowed his visage. Lehming did not recognize him; he could simply see that he was a tall manâabout as tall as Wetherel; all other peculiarities of figure were shrouded and disguised by that voluminous garment. Presently, too, as the unknown turned his face a little toward the wharf lamp, he perceived that that face was masked. The mask was a commonplace, grotesque affair, such as may be seen grimacing unchangeably through any toyshop window, and such as children buy to scare smaller comrades with. The nose was prodigious, the color of the lumpish cheeks was gross and glaring, and the huge mouth was moulded to counterfeit a clownish laugh. There was something preternaturally horrible in the contrast between this leering, smirking simulacrum and the supposed homicidal character of its wearer. When within six or eight feet of the figure Lehming halted, and asked in a voice which he could not quite steady, âIs this Darkness?â âYes,â replied the other. The utterance, like the shape, was unrecognizable. There was now a moment of silence during which Lehming rallied his thoughts and his strength for fresh speech, meanwhile listening to the lapping of the waters at the base of the wharf, and noting also a dull, faint thumping as of a boat beating against the timbers. âI come to you,â he resumed, âfrom Mr. Edward Wetherel.â âVery well,â responded the mask. There was no doubting or questioning; the speaker had the air of being quite sure of the authenticity and good faith of Lehming; it seemed probable that he might have recognized him. âHave you the paper?â asked the dwarf, after another pause. âWhat paper?â was the cautious answer. Lehming, after pondering a moment over this reticence, inferred from it that he must fully state his business, or the other would make no disclosures. âI was sent here,â he said, âto receive from you the will of Judge Jabez Wetherel, which you agreed to surrender to his nephew for one hundred thousand dollars.â âIt is here,â replied the stranger, slightly touching his breast with one hand, while the mask nodded and leered its immutable grimace, as if it were some Mephistophelean spectator of the drama who scoffed and sneered at the two human actors. âWill you let me see the willâmerely to make sure that you have it?â asked Lehming. The goblin visor shook a slight negative, and the hollow voice beneath it muttered: âI must first see the money.â There was a long and troubling silence, broken only by the swashing of the ripples and the thumping of the unseen boatâtwo sounds which were very strange as being audible on the verge of a great city, and very disquieting as suggesting easy homicide and the secure escape of the criminal. The disguised man did not turn; the boat behind and below him was evidently his and no other's; at least, so he believed. Had he turned, he would have seen something to give him alarm; he would have seen a face peering over the edge-beam, with its eyes fixed on him. Lehming, while fumbling with his sealed package and debating whether he should hold it forth, chanced to discover this head. At first he thought that the mask had a comrade there, and in his nervousness he involuntarily recoiled a pace. But in the next breath he saw a hand rise before the mysterious head, with one finger laid across the lips, as if enjoining silence. Then it occurred to him that perhaps the police were at hand; that Wetherel might have thought it best to advise them of the interview; that somehow or other justice had stumbled upon the trail of this misdoer. At all events a crisis had come, and he must do his best to help it forward; he must engage the attention of the mask to keep him from turning to see his peril. So he handed out his fraudful bundle, at the same time saying in a louder voice than he had yet used, âWhere is the will?â âI must look at this first,â returned the unknown, beginning to tear off the sealed envelope. It was natural enough that he should doubt whether a hundred thousand dollars had been brought him in the night by an unattended dwarf; only a very idiot of a rogue would believe in such an Arabian Nights adventure without ocular evidence of its actuality. He moved a little nearer to the wharf lamp, and continued to unroll the package with hands that shook quite visibly, his visor meanwhile grinning its hideous paper gratulation. Meantime the head behind him changed to a full figure, which stealthily grew up on the extreme verge of the wharf, whatever noise it made being drowned by the lapping of the water. Lehming tried not to look at it, for fear of warning the mask. He felt sure now that a policeman, or perhaps a party of the police, had watched the outgoings of this criminal and followed him to the rendezvous. In great trepidation, and dreading by moments lest his throbbing heart should beat him to the earth senseless, he dropped his eyes and awaited the result. Slowly, with a deliberation indeed which seemed to risk all chance of success, but steadily and without a sound that could reach the ear, the stranger moved toward the mask until he was within less than ten feet of him. Then he sprang, and instantly there was a furious struggle between the two, the one striving to escape and the other to hold fast, and both gasping out short, hard breaths loaded with curses. Lehming saw a sparkle between them as of drawn steel, but could not distinguish which grasped it, nor whether a blow was struck. Fearful, however, that the policeman would be hurt or overcome, he advanced to give him aid. But at this moment a new figure appeared on the scene, climbing up the dock and running toward the combatants. Lehming had just time to notice that this man, like the first, was not in police garb, but wore a short shaggy box-coat and slouched hat, when he heard some one mutter, as if through clenched teeth, âUpset that little fellow!â Almost instantaneously, and before he could think what the phrase meant, the last arrival gave him a fisticuff which laid him prostrate. It was a terrible blow; it bereft him of consciousness. When he came to himself some time must have elapsed, for all was quiet He lay still upon the wharf, just where he had fallen, with the lamp dimly shining in his eyes. He was chilled through; his cloak had been thrown open, as if to examine his clothing, and, as he afterwards discovered, his pockets were turned inside out. Raising himself on one elbow, and lifting his bruised, aching, dizzy head, he looked about him. At a little distance lay what seemed a corpse. It was the man with the capote. He rose, tottered toward this man, knelt by his side, and surveyed him attentively. The leering, grinning mask was still on the face, giving a horrible air of farce to this homicidal tragedy. It was not, however, fastened there, but had evidently fallen off or been torn off, and then carelessly replaced, perhaps in mockery. Lehming gently removed this painted ghost of hilarity, and stared at the uncovered visage with an amazement which nearly drowned his horror. âEdward!â he exclaimed. âNo, it is Poloski.â Yes, the dead man who lay there, the man who had volunteered to surrender the will of the murdered Judge Wetherel, was certainly Poloski. âIt is the finger of God,â continued Lehming, impressed by that wonder and awe, and that instinctive, impulsive belief in the supernatural, which are apt to descend upon us when we do happen to see a great crime followed by remarkable punishment. âNow all is explained,â he resumed after a moment. âNestoria mistook this man for Edward. Ah, well, she will be happy. He is innocent.â Meantime, he was gently opening the large coarse overcoat which enveloped the fallen figure. A moisture on his hands arrested his attention, and lifting them to the light, he saw stains of blood. Then, looking closely, he discovered in the clothing the clean-cut rents of stabsâseveral stabs, one of them close to the heart, if not penetrating it. âWhat does this mean?â he exclaimed, looking fearfully around him. âWhy should the detectives leave us here?â He had already searched in vain for Poloski's pulse with his chilled and glassy fingers. He warmed and softened them between his lips, and renewed his groping for signs of vitality. There was no movementâyes, there was a feeble, uncertain fluttering; or was it the beating of his own blood? Lehming feared this man, abhorred him, and almost revolted from touching him; yet he bent over him with an intense eagerness to see him live, dragging at him in spirit, one might say, to get him up the slopes of death. And Poloski still had breath in him; after some minutes he opened his eyes. It was the first time that Lehming had ever had the gaze of a vitally injured man fixed on his face; and he trembled all over, every fibre of his flesh seemed to quiver and crawl, with an agonizing thrill of pity. âShall I go and bring help?â he whispered, stooping close to the sufferer. Poloski did not at once reply, but it was probably not because he did not understand; for even a mortally wounded man does not become delirious until fever arrives; at first, if he has his consciousness, he has his reason. This man's silence sprang mainly no doubt from weakness, though partly also, it may be, from fear. Who that Lehming would seek would be likely to bring Poloski help, or fail to bring him further harm? âYesâgo,â he said at last, in a faint gurgle, at the same time turning his eyes toward the city. Lehming rose and set off in the direction of the Battery, trusting that there he might find a policeman, should accident favor. He ought of course to have secured the will first, but in his tenderness for this suffering and seemingly dying fellow creature he had not attempted to rummage for it, if indeed he had not temporarily forgotten it. Poloski, faint as he doubtless was, remembered it only too well; he had the presence of mind, resolution, and hardness of the practised criminal. The moment he was left alone he thrust his hand slowly inside his blood-stained vest, broke open a loosely stitched seam with his numbed fingers, and drew forth the document. His strength was as yet far from gone. A man may be terribly lacerated and still retain much muscular force. I have known a soldier, who had fallen unconscious with a miniÃ© ball through his lungs, to recover his senses and run a hundred yards or more for covert, there to fall again in a swoon. So Poloski, with five stabs in his body, two of them sure to be fatal, was able not only to secure this paper, but to mangle it with his teeth. But the work of destruction was not completed when Lehming reappeared; he had recollected the will and he came running to save it. Terrible as such a struggle must have been to him, he seized the wounded man's quivering hands and wrenched from them the bloody fragments. âI haveâruined you,â whispered Poloski, with a ghastly grimace which strove to be a smile. âYouâand those cursedâDinnefords. Youâshall have ânothing.â âThank Heaven!â replied Lehming with honest gladness. âIt is as it should be. Justice has been done by hands most strangely called to it.â Poloski stared at him; but the stare was that of a fading consciousness; he was once more swooning. His eyes had scarcely closed when new actors appeared upon the scene. As Lehming was gathering up and putting into his pockets the smaller tatters of the will he heard footsteps advancing rapidly down the wharf, and presently saw two men enter the circle of light about him. One of them was Edward Wetherel and the other detective James Sweet. âYou are alive then!â exclaimed Edward, joyfully. âI have suffered horrors about you. It was a foolish plan and a foolish risk. I could not help coming to see what had happened. But,â and here he glanced at the prostrate Poloski, âwhat is that?â âJiminy! it's the Poloski chap!â exclaimed Sweet, who had already discovered the body and coolly squatted himself to inspect it. âAnd hain't he been skewered, though? I say, Mr. Lehming, but you've had a busting old time with him,â he added, glancing with wonder and admiration at the little man, whom he regarded as the conqueror of Poloski in single combat. âI was talking with him whenââ Lehming began to explain. Then he turned to Wetherel and whispered rapidly, âHe tore up the will, but I have the pieces. I was talking with him,â he resumed aloud, âwhen some men climbed up over the wharf and assaulted him, knocking me down and going off before I recovered. I had an idea that they were police or detectives.â âDetectives?â interrupted Sweet. âThe devil!â he at once argued adversely. âDetectives wouldn't cut him up that way and then leave him; they'd want the rewards. Some of his own private friends done thisâsome of Riley's gang most probablyâbet you what you like it was Riley's gangâgo you my whole pile on it. What's he got in his mouth?â he continued, turning once more to the pallid face under his elbow. âIt's a piece of paper, by Jove! He's been tryin' to swallow it.â Inserting his horny fingers into Poloski's mouth, he unlocked the teeth with some difficulty, extricated a tattered scrap of paper, and held it up to the light. âLook here!â he went on; âthis concerns you gents. There's Wetherel on this.â âJabez Wetherel?â asked both Edward and Lehming, as they eagerly bent over him. âNo,â added the former. âOnly Wetherel, and not the whole of that. The signature is destroyed.â âThe signature!â exclaimed Sweet, aghast with sudden comprehension. âWhat! was this the will? The Wetherel will? And Poloski had it? Then he was the murderer. So that was what this night's business was about. Oh, Mr. Wetherel! you've played it rough on me. You've cut me out of the rewards. You brought me here, an' kep' me a-waitin', an' never told me a thing when I could a caught the man.â âI only brought you because I accidentally met you,â replied Wetherel, a little moved by this naÃ¯ve groan of distress, wrenched from the detective's in most pocket. âYou had failed completely so far. Never mind. You shall be well paid.â Somewhat comforted, Mr. Sweet touched Poloski with his boot and fell to moralizing. âSo this is the way the world goes, is it? Accident is the Boss. Here is the Wetherel Case, what I've been workin' at for three months and more, bust open all by itself. Police ain't nowhere. Detectives don't count. Justice takes the back seat. Well,â he sighed, facing about upon Lehming, âyou are a lucky customer. You git the swag, I s'pose. A round twenty thousan'! By jiminy, some fellows hit it, aim where they will!â he sighed again, surveying the misshapen, heavy-laden Lehming with really pathetic envy. The dwarf might have said, âI have lost a quarter of a million, and lost it gladly,â but he did not say it, nor think of it. He turned to Edward and asked anxiously, âCan you tell whether this man is still living?â âI think not,â hesitated Wetherel, seeking in vain with his chilled fingers for Poloski's pulse. âI cannot be sure yet, but he seems to me dead.â Lehming shuddered. âWithout one call to preparation!â he thought; âwhy did I not utter it?â An instant later, worn out with the labor, hardship, and anxiety of this tragedy which was now over, he sat down on the rimy planks of the wharf, very faint. âHurry off and get a hack,â said Wetherel to Sweet. âHe must be taken home.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LV. FACE TO FACE. It was a long time before Lehming awoke from his swoon, and when he did recover his senses he found himself exceedingly weak, as if he had barely escaped from the strangling coil of death. But he was in good hands, for he had been carried to the house of Mrs. Dinneford, and that tender mother in Israel had had him put to bed, and was now watching over him. âThere, go to sleep again,â were the first words that he heard on opening his eyes. âYou can't do better than sleep.â âYesâI can do better,â he whispered after a minute of vacant gazing, during which his memory of the past and his full intelligence of the present returned to him. âWhere is Nestoria?â âMust you see her now?â objected Mrs. Dinneford, not in the least guessing how much the girl was to him, but merely judging him unfit for conversation with any one. âAre you sure that you can bear it?â âI can bear it best now,â murmured Lehming, his mind fixed on the fact that he must surrender Nestoria to Edward, and feeling that he could do it easiest in this hour of weakness, which was so near to unconsciousness. Mrs. Dinneford went out, but almost immediately returned, leading the girl by the arm and prattling cheerfully: âShe was just dressed, and bent on seeing you.â Nestoria came up to the bedside in her quiet, quick way, took Lehming's hand, and whispered, âMy poor, dear friend!â âI have found the will,â he said at once, while something like a tear glistened in his eyes. âPoloski had it.â âHe was the murderer,â added Nestoria. Lehming looked up at her with surprise, she had spoken so promptly and assuredly. âI saw him yesterday,â she continued. âI thought he was EdwardâMr. Wetherel. When I found that he was not Mr. Wetherel I felt sure that he must be the murderer.â âAnd you had believed Edward guilty?â asked Mrs. Dinneford. Nestoria fell upon her knees, buried her face in the bedclothes, and sobbed violently, exclaiming from time to time, âOh, what injustice!â âI saw him by night,â she went on after a while. âAnd they do surely resemble each other. I thought he was Edward. I was sure of it. But, oh, what injustice! I can never forgive myself. He never can forgive me. No man could forgive such an imputation. And from me especially, who was bound to believe in him, and had promised to trust him! Oh, it is unpardonable! And I was all wrongâwrong all the way through. I have been wrong in concealing this thing. I should have spoken; I should have told what I knewâor thought I knew. Then there might have been an explanation. The truth might have come to light long ago. What misery I have made for myself and others by disobeying my conscience! I shall never be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven.â âWe have all been wrong,â whispered Lehming, venturing to put his sallow hand on her sunny head. âMy hiding of you was wrong. My not insisting with you for an immediate divulgence of the truth was wrong. It was of a piece with the general lack of proper feeling in America toward crime. I have done what soft-hearted people do who sign petitions for mercy to assassins. I have done what unfaithful policemen and jurymen and judges and governors do. I have sought, with a false and unwise and sinful pity, to shield sin from punishment. Even when I fully believed Edward to be guilty, I wanted to save him from the gallows, or at least to put off justice. We have been wrong, and I more than all, for I knew it. It has turned out well, but not through our meritsâonly through the compassion of God. But as He has benignly directed, so I trust that He will patiently pardon.â âHow can we doubt the infinite mercy?â broke in cheerful, confident Mrs. Dinneford, always ready to be a medium for heavenly revelations, especially those of a comfortable character. âHaven't we been already guided and delivered in the most wonderful, long-suffering, salvatory, reassuring, convincing manner? What might have happened to us but for these gracious dealings? What if that murderer had been permitted to carry away Alice to some of his dens of blood? But Apollyon was beaten there, and at every point; and those who combated him have been brought through victorious, in spite of their errors; and they will have undeserved forgiveness as surely as they have had undeserved succor. And as for you two little creatures falling into agonies of remorse about what has befallen, why it is certainly the most extraordinary sight that I ever beheld in my life. I should as soon expect to hear two pet lambs go to groaning over their sins because the wolf had killed the watchdog. In my humble opinion, if our Heavenly Father had no worse children than you, it would be a very respectable family. Of course, I don't want to encourage you to boast yourselves in the face of the divine perfection. As Tupper says, Humility mainly becometh a man in converse with his Maker. But there is such a thing as a child of Adam dealing over-strictly with himself, and holding himself to account as if he were a god instead of a feeble, soft-hearted, muddle-headed mortal, and, in short, exalting himself under pretence of a superhuman responsibility and contrition. It's as though a butterfly should claim that he was the chief of sinners, because he failed to fly as high as an eagle, or as though the automaton trumpet-player should put on dust and ashes because he blew a poorer tune than the man who invented him. I do believe that you two have done the best that God gave you the sense and heart to do. Let us forget our little selves and our infinitesimal shortcomings, in surveying the wisdom and power and goodness of Deity. It does seem to me that all has ended well enough to make all worthy souls turn their various murmurs into a song of content. Here is this poor murderer dead, as Edward just now sends word to me; gone off after a short revival of consciousness, in which he talked about his Origins of Speech, and wanted some charitable body to finish them for him; but not suffered to depart until he had confessed his crime in the hearing of the police, and so cleared the innocent. And here are all the rest of us spared to see the unravelling of this bloody web of mystery, and knowing each other to be guiltless. There is our crowning mercy. No more suspicions of ensanguined foot-tracks in our midst! No Cain among us with a mark on his forehead! What an awful scene, by the way, that is in `Macbeth' where Lady Macbeth washes and washes her hands in vain! Our hands are clean, and we know it. What we have done of evil is to suspect wrongfully. We must bow down to Edward and ask his pardon. I shall send a note to him at once.â She paused in her torrent of speech, glanced anxiously and yet with a humorous expression at the girl beside her, and then asked, âShall I say anything for you, Nestoria?â âI wrote to him last night,â replied Nestoria, looking Mrs. Dinneford full in the face with that frankness and bravery which her eyes always had. âI told him how I had suspected him, and how I had come to believe him innocent. I asked his pardon. He will get the letter to-day.â âAnd as soon as he gets it he will come here,â said Mrs. Dinneford with smiling excitement, as of a woman who sees a bridal at hand. âI should not think he would ever wish to see me again,â murmured Nestoria, shaking her golden head sorrowfully. Mrs. Dinneford merely patted the girl on the shoulder; she believed that an hour of purest happiness was coming to her; but sympathetic and garrulous as she was, she would not forestall it by babbling. Lehming, meanwhile, his pallid face propped up by a pillow, gazed at Nestoria with an indescribable tenderness, rejoicing in the joy which would soon be hers. He felt sure that she did not even guess of his love for her, and the fact that he had never revealed it gave him some small gladness. Had she known it, the knowledge might have troubled her now, when her other troubles were departing. Balm though her pity might have been to him, he would not have purchased it at the cost of any diminution of her happiness, so entirely had he given her his unselfish affection. Some hours later, while Mrs. Dinneford and Nestoria were together in the parlor, the door bell suddenly fell into a violent agitation, and the girl divined the arrival of Edward Wetherel. She turned pale at once, and caught her hostess by the skirt of the dress, whispering, âI cannot see him alone.â The warm-hearted lady took her by the shoulders, pushed her gently back upon a sofa, kissed her, and left the room. When Edward entered he saw his betrothed sitting moveless and seemingly unable to move, her childlike face as pale as it could be, and her blue eyes fixed on him in a kind of fascination of dreadful expectancy. He knew at once that the letter which she had written him, imputing great wrong to herself, and humbly begging his forgiveness, had been no mere verbal exaggeration, and no statement of momentary emotion, but an honest overflow of deep remorse and penitence. His very flesh shook with pity for such trouble, and with longing to put an instant end to it. Without a word he advanced softly to her, knelt on one knee at her feet, took both her hands in his and kissed them passionately. âOh, no, no, no! I am not worthy,â broke out Nestoria, the tears rolling down her cheeks. âYou must not show me any kindness. You must not like me. I am unworthy of your trust. I have wronged you dreadfully and unpardonably.â âBut you have righted me,â replied Edward, rising and taking a seat by her side, while still holding her hands. âYou believe in me now?â âYes, I know now that you are good,â said the girl, sobbing so violently that her words were hardly distinguishable. âI know that you are far better than I am, very far better than I have been. I cannot talk about it. Did you get my letter? Did you read where I asked your pardon?â âI did, and I pardoned,â he answered, comprehending her intense humiliation and remorse, and believing that the blunt assurance of forgiveness would not pain but comfort her. âDo you still blame yourself? I do not. Appearances were darkly against me. The life that I had led was my condemnation. What a life it must have been, and was! I ought to ask your pardon for being such a man as that you could reasonably believe great ill of me. I ought to ask your pardon, and not you mine. Well, I trust that I have changed. I am at your feet once more. I ask you again to judge whether I am worthy to be your husband. Will you take me?â âOh, I must not,â groaned Nestoria. âIt would be so wrong in me, after all I have done! Don't you think I need any punishment?â she burst out vehemently. âDon't you see that you and everybody ought to punish me? I have broken my word to you and my faith with society. I am a wicked, wicked woman.â âNo, no!â pleaded Edward. âDon't say that; at least not now. We will talk of your responsibility to society another time. What you did, you did for love of me, and I can only hold you the dearer for it. Do submit your mind and heart to mine. Do answer my question.â He put his arm around her, drew her gently close to him and forced her to lay her head upon his shoulder. âOh, I am so weak against you!â whispered Nestoria, a calmer expression stealing over her convulsed face. âI am so unable to resist you!â âThen you will be engaged to me once more?â he begged. âWill you?â With a sigh which had the echo of sobs in it, Nestoria murmured brokenly, âIf you wish itâif you will have it soâI mustâyes.â âBut I alone will be engaged,â she continued, as he drew her closer and kissed away her tears. âYou shall be free. You shall turn me off whenever you wish. Promise it, Edward! Do you?â âNo,â he replied, holding her face between his hands and looking down into her eyes with a smile. âI bind myself to you forever.â âOh, how can you!â she exclaimed, giving up the contest and letting her head fall on his breast. After she had lain there a little while she suddenly caught up one of his hands in both hers, and before he could prevent her, pressed it to her lips. It was an instinctive, unpremediated, passionate gesture of joyful humiliation, absolute confidence, and absorbing love. It apprised him, as perhaps nothing else could have done, that he had given his heart to a heart which was altogether his, and which by its power of affection was worthy of all that he could give. Herein, that is to say in her capacity of living for others, lay the greatness of this simple girl, such greatness as she could claim. Amid all her ignorance of the world, amid her incompleteness of education and her youthful limitations of thought, amid her resultant errors of judgment and of conduct, she was possessed by a heroic self-abnegation and an almost superhuman affection. Even when this man by her side had appeared to her quite dead in trespasses and sins, she had still so loved him that she could not denounce him to just punishment, and could not but continue to hope, against the evidence of her senses, in his innocence, and was willing to bear every extremity of suffering for his sake. Indeed, the central fact of her story is simply this, that in some natures love is lord of all, ennobling them in spite of misdoing. It must be conceded that there has appeared in this story no grand triumph of conscience or of wisdom, recommendable for wide imitation. Nestoria, a merely finite and fragile creature, has been guided by pungent emotion rather than by cool and large reflection. But at least her emotions have not concerned her alone; she has not lived, as a selfish woman in her place might have done, to âenjoy herselfâ and to âhave a good timeâ; she has been loving enough to bear through dolorous months the burden which seemed to belong to another. And with regard to her one evil deed, the persistent concealment of a supposed criminal, we may allege in her excuse that circumstances had placed her in a position of singular difficulty, and that those circumstances had been prolonged by the immoral inefficiency of our judicial system, so that American society must shoulder a part of her blameworthiness. Well, she had fought out her wretched battle, and now she was receiving her reward. She was lying on the heart of a man intelligent enough to divine what stings of terror and of conscience she had borne for his sake, and gratefully loving enough to cover both her bygone sorrows and her clinging remorse with a flood of consolation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LVI. WHAT BECAME OF THEM ALL. âAh! this cannot lastâthis ought not to last,â Nestoria exclaimed of a sudden, drawing herself back from Edward and looking him in the face with a strange mixture of fear and joy. âI am too happy,â she went on. âI do not deserve any such happiness. It will be surely taken away from me, unless I become more worthy of it. I must strive in some way to be more fit for it than I have been and am. Do you know what I have long thought that I must do as soon as this mystery should clear away and I could see to stir? I have felt that I must pass the rest of my life in suffering to do good, instead of suffering, as I have done, to do evil. I have wanted to go as aâmissionary,â she faltered out, with a piteous, pleading gaze into his eyes, as if doubting whether he would let her go. We know already that Wetherel was of the firm and even masterful caste of souls, such as his ancestors had mostly been before him, in spite of their prevailing devoutness; but the look of tenderness which he now bent upon Nestoria showed that over her he intended to hold no sceptre of unpersuasive rule. This one being was to be on equal terms with him, the associated monarch of their united life, at least so far as she should desire. âMy dear child, our existence is to be one,â he said gently, at the same time kissing her hands. âI do not wish to dissuade you from obeying your conscience, nor from going where you can do the most good to others. But must we not consider also where I can be useful? You are already possessed of a foreign language which will enable you to be at once of worth on a mission. I should have to study years to acquire that language. Moreover, I have not even a profession; there are more years of waiting and preparation; and meanwhile life is hurrying by. Then, on the other hand, among my own countrymen there is work all ready for me, and more than I can do. If I am forced to retain a portion of my uncle's estate, I shall have means to enter upon large philanthropies, such as I can myself oversee. I have thought this all over many times already, and decided that I can be usefullest in America. Oh, there are huge plans for doing good in my poor head,â he added, with an apologetical smile. âBut, grandiose as they are, they may come to something. Will you not let your decision wait until you can hear about them?â âAh, yes,â sighed Nestoria, conscious, and joyfully conscious, too, despite her scruples, of that weakness of love which trusts all to the love of a stronger soul. âYou must be considered. You can do far more in the world than I. You must not be planted in poor earth because I might grow there to my own satisfaction. I leave everything to you.â It was not a painful act of submission, although she did for an instant have a vague fear lest she were doing wrong, and lest her fretful conscience might some day assault her because of it. And now footsteps were heard, and Nestoria ran away to hide her happiness, rustling out of one door as Mrs. Dinneford, Alice, and Lehming entered by another. The elder lady's eye sought Wetherel's face with a cordial yet humorous glance of inquiry. âIt is all as it should be,â said the young man; whereupon Mrs. Dinneford smiled with pleasure, while Lehming, too shrewd at guessing, turned pale. Then there was much talk about the adventure of the past night, the wonderful discovery and punishment of the murderer, and, in short, about the whole Wetherel Affair. âOnly one thing remains to be settled,â said Edward. âThat is the ownership of this estate. I have pieced the will together as far as may be, and shown it to a lawyer. He says that it is worthless. The signature of the testator is torn off and partly destroyed. The signatures of the witnesses have entirely vanished. The provisions are more or less incomplete. In short, it is worthless. I am the heir.â âIt is well,â assented Lehming, in a firm voice, while Mrs. Dinneford and Alice uttered some murmur of assent, which was naturally less clear and emphatic. âI will tell you what I propose,â continued Edward. âI propose to pay in full the legacies to philanthropic and religious objects, so far as they can be made out or inferred. So much must be done out of respect to the lifelong character of the dead as a lover of his fellow men and of his Maker. You agree to that, I see. But after that, what? You must admit that it is a weighty, and at the same time a delicate question. I have tried to decide upon some plan of division, without being able to satisfy myself. I have offered you the whole, and you have refused. Nor will I take the whole. There we are at a deadlock. You three must help me out.â âIt reminds me,â put in Mrs. Dinneford, âof the favorite exhortation of a pious, speechless deacon whom I used to know. `Brethren,' he used to say, prayer-meeting after prayer-meeting, `brethren, we mustn't have too much delicacy.' What the good old slow creature meant by it I never could imagine, nor, I dare say, he either. But it applies to our situation surely. We are bothered by too much delicacy. Somebody ought to speak plainly and in business-like fashion; and when it comes to business, I say let the men begin.â âCertainly,â nodded Wetherel. âCome, Walter, you are a just man; tell us what shall be done.â âI have a whim,â replied Lehming with a smileââI have a whim which settles my portion. It seems to me that I may fairly claim the rewards, all of them; those offered by the authorities and by the estate, those offered for the discovery of Miss Bernard and of the criminal. They come to twenty thousand dollars. That sum will just serve me. I claim it, and no more. Don't interrupt me, Edward. You called on me to judge this case. Well, as for these excellent Dinneford ladies,â he continued, smiling from one to another, âthey ought surely to be as liberal, or magnanimous, or just, or whatever it may be, between them, as I am alone. I give up a quarter of a million which doesn't belong to me. Let them club together and do the same. That leaves them a quarter of a million, which is not pinching poverty, even in these times. As for the heir at law,â turning to Wetherel, âlet him take his half million and hold his peace. There, you have my arbitration, and I sincerely hope that no one will oppose it.â There was a general smile, which was clearly one of satisfaction, and which ended the discussion. In short, such were the terms according to which this fastidiously delicate matter of settling the Wetherel estate was finally decided. The Dinnefords were more than content with their allotment, and Lehming positively refused to accept aught but what he had assigned himself. And now John Bowlder rumbled into the house, as big and noisy and cheerful and unpractical as ever. âThere is your dollar, Walter,â were his first words, meanwhile thrusting a bill into Lehming's breast pocket. âTake it before I become vainglorious over it and assume it as a blazon, or turn greedy and put it at interest. Take it as a present, if not otherwise. It is a curiosity. It is Bowlder's only dollar, the only one that ever really belonged to him, because the only one that he ever earned. He wants never to see it again. He desires no more dollars from that source. He prefers money that has been left him. Toil is all very well for the predestined and habituated sons of toil; but the soul which basks in its own sunshine can be happiest without it. By the way, I hear that the Wetherel mystery has exploded, and that Nettie Fulton has reappeared out of it as Nestoria Bernard. Life is protean. It is also a Nemesis. Nemesis at times interferes with Proteus, and tears off his disguises. Meanwhile the tranquil soul looks on, and thinks it as good as a play, taking that much interest in it, and no more. The girl Nestoria, however, I should like to see. There is somewhat about her which is good for the spectator, making him both happy and benign.â So Nestoria was sent for, and Bowlder greeted her with affectionate uproar, very absurd in a philosopher. âI rejoice heartily,â he admitted, âthat your worries are over. I am driven to profess at least as much common humanity as that. You are one of the magicians, and bring me down to earth.â âHow does poor Imogen Eleonore get on?â asked Nestoria. âIs she lonely? Tell her I shall soon come to see her.â âPoor Imogen has taken to herself another likewise poor creature, and gone into the moonshine of betrothed bliss,â returned Bowlder. âA lover of ancient days came down from Vermont yesterday, and carried her off this morning with such ease that it seemed as if she were carrying him off. It is not often that two souls take on a duality more promptly. She promised wedding cake in time. Her last words to me were, Farewell, a long farewell! Let us hope that she spoke prophetically,â solemnly added Bowlder, who had at last discovered that Miss Jones's grandiose conversation had the emptiness as well as the gaudiness of a soap bubble. âThe Turks believe that idiots are inspired. But that credence is not a part of my religion. At all events, I desire to hear no more of Imogen Eleonore's inspirations, and warn you against her as being not heavenly but mundane, and poor at that.â âAh! she had not helped you,â said Nestoria thoughtfully. âI owe her much kindness. I must think how I can repay her.â We need add no more, unless the reader would like to know that Alice Dinneford, blessed with a sufficient fortune and some experimental wisdom, means to have an American husband of the usual sort, and will probably not find it hard to get one.
