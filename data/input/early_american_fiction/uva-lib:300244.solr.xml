      <field name="fulltext">1 † CHAPTER XXII. “I have nursed him at this withered breast,” said the old woman, folding her hands on her bosom as if pressing an infant to it; “and man can never ken what woman feels for the bairn that she has first held to her bosom.” Scott. Poor Arthur! B— had predicted too truly that his heart would have some hankerings at the thought of leaving the house where he had, of late, spent so many pleasant hours. It is so long that I have said nothing about him, that the reader may think him forgotten, or may, himself, have forgotten that there was such a person. He had, in truth, no part in the transactions of which we have been speaking. He was at that time of life when the mind, chameleon like, takes its hue from surrounding objects. He was too young to be advised with, or trusted with important secrets. I have already mentioned that, on the day of the election, he had been detained at home by indisposition. But he had heard of the occurrences of that day; and he was, moreover, unconsciously exposed to influences from every member of the family, all tending to the same point. Least apparent, but not least efficacious, was that of his cousin Lucia. They were of that age when hearts, soft and warm, grow together by mere contact. With thought of love, but without thinking of it, they had become deeply enamored of each other. The thing came about so simply and so naturally, that the result alone needs to be told. They were now to part, and the thought of parting first made them both feel that something was the matter. They talked of the separation, and Lucia shed some tears. Arthur kissed them off, and then she smiled; and then she wept again; and then they agreed never to forget each other; and so on, till the secret was out, and their innocent hearts were fondly plighted. Such things do not pass unmarked by older eyes. The maternal instinct of Mrs. Trevor, and the sagacity of her husband, had detected that of which the parties themselves were unconscious. And now, in the few hours that they were to remain together, occupied as the old people were with important engagements, neither the glowing cheek, the swimming eye, and the abstracted look of Lucia, nor the rapt enthusiasm of Arthur's countenance, escaped observation. But as no disclosure was made of what had passed, their fancied privacy was not invaded by question or insinuation. They were too young to marry, and secret love is so sweet! Why not let the innocent creatures enjoy the idea that their attachment was not suspected? Their friends smiled indeed, but tenderly, not significantly. To them, they did but seem kinder than ever; and that, at a moment when they were most sensible to kindness, and most ready to reciprocate it. In this heart-searching sympathy, Arthur found himself indissolubly united to the destiny, the opinions, and the feelings, whatever these might be, of those who so loved his dear Lucia. But I am not writing a love tale. I am but interested that the reader should understand by what process two principal actors in the scenes of which I am about to speak, were diverted from a zealous devotion to the authority of the United States, in which they had been educated, to a devotion yet more enthusiastic in the cause of Virginia. Enough of them has been seen to show that I must be anxious to vindicate them from any charge of inconsistency. I trust the reader enters into this feeling, and deems them worthy of it. If he requires any farther account of the causes which wrought so great a change, I have none to give. It was through their eyes and hearts that conviction entered. Outrage to the laws; outrage to the freedom of election; outrage to one respected and beloved; left nothing for reason to do. Doubtless much had been said to them by their uncle and Mr. B—, in explanation of the great principles of the American Union, which had been trampled on by the Federal Government. But I am not aware that any ideas were presented to their minds on this subject, with which the reading public had not been familiar for twenty years before, and I shall not repeat them here. Let us rather accompany Douglas to Mr. Trevor's magazine of arms. It was in a garret room, where he found Mr. B— busy in the examination of arms, and portioning out ammunition, with the aid of Jack. “You come in good time,” said B—. “Here is work that you understand. Come help me examine these arms, and see that they are all clean, dry, and well flinted.” “What do you propose to do with them?” asked Douglas, lending a hand to the work. “We propose,” said B—, “to arm the negroes in defence of their master, in case of need.” “But what need can there be, if we set out for Carolina in the morning?” “They may be wanted before morning,” said B—, coolly. “Lieutenant Johnson left the county on the night of the election, and travelled express to Washington. His intelligence was anticipated, and, no doubt, the warrants were all ready before he got there. I dare say they had a ready-made affidavit for him to swear to. This plot was got up so suddenly, that I was hardly advised of it in time. But I hope it is not too late. I have no mind to fire the train too soon. I would rather you should get off 1 † peaceably, but, if we do come to blows, I shall take care that the blue-coats have the worst of it.” “You move in this business,” said Douglas, “like a man not unused to danger. I presume you have taken the precaution to warn in the hardy and resolute neighbors, whom I saw stand by my uncle the other day.” “By no means,” answered B. “Were we so minded, we could command a force that would demolish any that will be sent against us. But it is not desirable to show the strength of our hand. I should be glad, if possible, that the temper of the people were unsuspected. At the same time, there is an exhibition to be made, which will have a good effect on friend and foe,—I mean an exhibition of the staunch loyalty and heart-felt devotion of the slave to his master. We must show that that which our enemies, and some even of ourselves, consider as our weakness, is, in truth, our strength.” “Is such your own clear opinion?” asked Douglas. “I have lived so long in the North, that I have imbibed too many of the ideas that prevail there. But, on this point, it appears to me that they must be right.” “You have not lived there long enough,” said B—, “to forget your earliest and strongest attachments. You had a black nurse, I presume. Do you love her?” “My mammy!” exclaimed Douglas; “to be sure I do. I should be the most ungrateful creature on earth, if I did not love one who loves me like a mother.” “And your foster-brother?” asked B—; “and his brothers and sisters? Do not they, too, love him their mother loves so fondly?” “I have no doubt they do, especially as I have always been kind to them.” “From these, then, I presume, you would fear nothing. Then your brothers and sisters. They, too, have their mammies and foster-brethren. Among you, you must have a strong hold on the hearts of many of your father's slaves. Would they, think you, taken as a body, rise against your family?” “I have not the least apprehension that they would,” replied Douglas. “Yet they, thus considered, are one integral part of the great black family, which, in all its branches, is united by similar ligaments to the great white family. You have the benefit of the parental feeling of the old who nursed your infancy, and watched your growth. You have the equal friendship of those with whom you ran races, and played at bandy, and wrestled in your boyhood. If sometimes a dry blow passed between you, they love you none the less for that; because, unless you were differently trained from what is common among our boys, you were taught not to claim any privilege, in a fight, over those whom you treated as equals in play. Then you have the grateful and admiring affection of the little urchin whose head you patted when you came home, making him proud by asking his name, and his mammy's name, and his daddy's name. These are the filaments which the heart puts out to lay hold on what it clings to. Great interests, like large branches, are too stiff to twine. These are the fibres from which the ties that bind man to man are spun. The finer the staple, the stronger the cord. You will probably see its strength exemplified before morning. There are twenty true hearts which will shed their last drop, before one hair of your uncle's head shall fall.” “You present the matter in a new light,” said Douglas. “I wish our northern brethren could be made to take the same view of it.” “Our northern brethren, as you call them,” said B—, “never can take this view of it. They have not the qualities which would enable them to comprehend the negro character. Their calculating selfishness can never understand his disinterested devotion. Their artificial benevolence is no interpreter of the affections of the unsophisticated heart. They think our friend Jack here to be even such as themselves, and cannot therefore conceive that he is not ready to cut his master's throat, if there is any thing to be got by it. They know no more of the feelings of our slaves, than their fathers could comprehend of the loyalty of the gallant cavaliers from whom we spring; and for the same reason. The generous and self-renouncing must ever be a riddle to the selfish. The only instance in which they have ever seemed to understand us, has been in the estimate they have made of our attachment to a Union, the benefits of which have all been theirs, the burthens ours. Reverse the case, and they would have dissolved the partnership thirty years ago. But they have presumed upon the difference between us, and heaped oppression on oppression, until we can bear no more. But, when we throw off the yoke, they will still not understand us. They will impute to us none but selfish motives, and take no note of the scorn and loathing which their base abuse of our better feelings has awakened. Would they but forbear so much as not to force us to hate and despise them, they might still use us as their hewers of wood and drawers of water. But he who gives all where he loves, will give nothing where he detests. But this, too, is a riddle to them.” “I must own,” said Douglas, “that these ideas are new to me, too.” “Not the ideas, but the application of them. Three months ago, you were the devoted soldier of Martin Van Buren. Had you then believed him capable of a conspiracy so base as that which has been plotted against your honor and life, could you still have served him?” “I should still have wished to serve my country,” replied Douglas; “but I should, probably, have doubted whether I could have served her in serving him.” “And do you think you would view the matter differently, had another been the intended victim, and not yourself?” “I trust not. My personal concern in the affair, I think, has done no more than to emancipate me from my thraldom. But the display of his character is what makes me detest him; and the scenes of the election day have opened my eyes to the wrongs, and the rights, and the interests of Virginia. The scales have now fallen from them, and I am impatient for the day when I may apply in her service the lessons learned in the school of her oppressors.” “You shall have your wish,” said B—. “The flint you are now fitting may yet be snapped against the myrmidons of the usurper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. Osric.... How is it, Laertes?Laertes.... Why as a woodcock to my own spring, Osric. Shakspeare. While this conversation was going on, the arms had been all examined, loaded, and ranged against the wall, and due portions of powder and ball allotted to each firelock. Their work being nearly completed, Douglas was dispatched with some message to his uncle. As he descended the stairs, he heard, not without a smile, the quick impatient step of Arthur, pacing to and fro, the length of a passage leading from the front door through the building. Arthur was just turning at the end next to the door, when a rap on the knocker arrested him. The door was instantly opened, and he was heard to ask some one to walk in. It was night, and the passage was dark. Arthur conducted the stranger to the door of his uncle's study, which was his common reception room, ushered him in, drew back, and having closed the door behind him, resumed his musing promenade. Douglas went on, suspecting nothing. He was not aware that the servants had been cautioned against admitting strangers; and poor Arthur was not au fait to what was passing. He entered the room. His uncle had risen from his chair in the corner farthest from the door, and was standing behind a large table, at which he usually wrote. He heard him say: “Please to be seated, sir,” in a voice between compliment and command, and with a countenance in which courtesy and fierceness were strangely blended. As the stranger, not regarding this stern invitation, continued to advance, the glare of the old man's eye became fearful, and he laid his hand on a pistol which lay on the table before him. “Stand back, sir,” said he, in a low and resolute tone. “Stand back, on your life.” The stranger wore a long surtout, in which Douglas, dazzled by coming into the light, did not at first discover the usual characteristics of an officer's undress. It was thrown open in front, and the badges of his rank were displayed to Mr. Trevor, who stood before him. He was arrested by Mr. Trevor's startling words and gesture, and was beginning to speak, when Douglas exclaimed: “What does this mean?” The stranger turned, extended both his arms, and Douglas rushed into them. “My dear Trevor!” “My dear Whiting!” were the mutual exclamations of two young men, who had long been to each other as brothers. “To what on earth,” asked Douglas, “do I owe this pleasure?” “I come,” said the other, with a melancholy smile, and in the kindest tone, while he still held the hand of Douglas, “to make you prisoner.” Douglas started violently, and tried to disengage his hand; but the other held him firmly and went on: “Be calm, my dear fellow. I am your friend as ever, but yet I do not jest. You are my prisoner, on the absurd charge of high treason against the United States. My warrant is against you and your uncle. As it was thought a military force might be wanted to support the arrest, I volunteered myself to receive a deputation from the marshal, that I might shield you both from any indignity. You, on your part, I am sure, will do nothing to make my task more painful than it is. Is not that gentleman—bless me! where is he? Was not that Mr. Bernard Trevor who just left the room?” “I am Mr. Bernard Trevor,” said a voice behind. Whiting turned again, and saw Mr. Trevor standing where he had been before. He now observed that there was a door beside him, at which he had stepped out and returned. “I am Mr. Bernard Trevor, sir, and am sorry that I cannot welcome, as I would, the friend of my nephew. You see that I have no mind to leave the room, and I therefore 2 † hope you will content yourself to accept my invitation to be seated. You say that you wish to shield me from indignity. Of course, you will not unnecessarily offer what I shall feel as such. The hand of authority must not be laid on me.” “I shall gladly dispense with an unpleasant form, sir,” said Whiting, “and I trust I shall have the satisfaction of convincing you that my errand, though painful to all of us, is an errand of friendship.” “I have no doubt of it, sir. I have heard of you from my nephew, and from under your own hand, in terms that give full assurance of that. I shall be happy, therefore, to do by you all the duties of hospitality. I merely ask of you to give your word of honor, that, while charged with your present functions, you will be careful not to touch my person.” “I should be most happy,” said the young man, “to take by the hand one whom I so highly respect, but I find I must forego that pleasure; and I give the required pledge most cheerfully.” The courteous old gentleman now summoned Tom, and ordered some refreshment for his guest; then throwing into his manner all the frank courtesy of a polished Virginian, he led the way in a desultory conversation on all sorts of indifferent subjects. Half an hour passed in this way, when Tom appeared and summoned the gentlemen to supper. “I fear,” said Whiting, “I am abusing my authority over my poor fellows without. I have a sergeant and half a dozen men waiting at the gate, on whose behalf I would fain invoke your hospitality. But it would be much more agreeable to me, if you and my friend Douglas will pass your words that their aid shall not be necessary, and permit me to order them back to the next public house.” “I am sorry to say,” replied Mr. Trevor, “that I cannot do either; but I pray you to postpone the discussion until after supper.” “How, sir?” exclaimed Whiting. “You surely do mean to try to escape me.” “Nothing is farther from my thoughts, sir,” said the old man, with a proud smile, “than to try to escape you, or permit you to escape me.” “To escape you, sir! What do you mean?” asked Whiting. “I mean not to wound your ear with a word I would not have endured to have applied to myself. I will not say that you are my prisoner; but I will say that we will leave this house as free as you entered it. Come, my dear sir, while I endeavor to requite your courtesy, permit me also to appropriate your words, and say, as you said to Douglas, that I trust you will not render it necessary to avail ourselves of our superior force.” “I am not sure you possess that superiority,” said Whiting; “I have a strong guard without.” “But they are without, and you are within. Besides, you will be readily excused from availing yourself of them, when it is known that they are prisoners, in close custody.” “Prisoners!” exclaimed Whiting. “To whom?” “To my negroes,” said Mr. Trevor. “Regular soldiers prisoners to negroes!” said Whiting, in amazement. “It is not credible; and you manifestly speak by conjecture, as you have had no means of communicating with your friends without.” “I am not in the habit, young gentleman,” said Mr. Trevor, in a tone of grave rebuke, “of speaking positively, when I speak by conjecture. My orders were, that I should not be called to supper until they were secured. As to the strangeness of the affair,” continued he, resuming his cheerful and good-humored smile, “think nothing of that. Remember that night is what the negroes call `their time of day.' The eagle is no match for the owl in the dark. The thing is as I tell you; so make yourself easy, and let me have the pleasure of doing the duties of hospitality by my nephew's friend. You shall not be unnecessarily detained. We must ask the pleasure of your company for a three hours' ride across the line in the morning. I will there give you a clear acquittance against all the responsibility you may have incurred, for what you have done, or left undone; and, as soon as you return, to restrain your men from acts of license, they shall be given up to you.” There was no remonstrating against this arrangement; and Lieutenant Whiting, putting the best face he could on the matter, permitted himself to be conducted to supper. At the head of the supper table stood, as usual, Mrs. Trevor. She seemed some six inches higher than common, her cheek flushed, her nostril spread, her eye beaming; yet with all her high feelings subdued to the duties of hospitality and courtesy. She met and returned the salutation of Whiting with the stately grace of a high-bred lady, and then her eye glanced to her husband with a look of irrepressible pride. His glance answered it, and, as they stood for a moment facing each other at the opposite ends of the table, Whiting felt a sense of admiring awe, such as the presence of majesty in full court had never inspired. But this feeling, in a moment, passed away, with its cause. The urbanity of the gentleman and the suavity of the lady soon removed all the painfulness of constraint, and the evening passed as it should pass between persons who in heart were friends. Neither Mr. B— nor Arthur made their appearance. The girls, indeed, were present. The air and manner of Delia reflected those of her mother. Virginia looked a little alarmed, and Lucia blushing, tender, and abstracted. The interest of the realities 2 † that surrounded her could not quite dispel the visions of excited fancy. With these exceptions, which a stranger would not observe, every thing passed as in the company of an invited and cherished guest, and Whiting could not be sorry, at heart, that he had been baffled in his attempt to disturb so sweet a domestic party. The evening wore away not unpleasantly, and he retired to rest in the same room with Douglas, to guard him, or be guarded by him, according as it suited his fancy to consider himself or his friend as the other's prisoner. A word of explanation is due on the subject of the captive guard, which will be given in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. Massa mighty cunning—watch he nigger like a hawk; But nigger like a owl—he watch massa in e dark. Jim Crow. The first words which passed between Mr. Trevor and Lieutenant Whiting, had been overheard by Tom, who was in the act of leaving the room at the moment. He gave the alarm to his mistress, who, hastening to her husband, met him at the door, and just received from him the instructions already mentioned. She immediately sent for Mr. B—, who, with Jack's aid, was in the act of distributing arms and ammunition to the negroes. To him the management of the whole affair was committed. No doubt was entertained that Lieutenant Whiting had not come unattended. The first thing to be done was to ascertain the force by which he was supported, and the place where he had posted his men. They, meantime, quietly awaited the return of their officer at the great gate, a quarter of a mile from the house. Rather as a point of military etiquette than from an idea that any precaution was necessary, they had stacked their arms in form before the gate, and stationed a sentinel, who, with head erect and military step, walked his post in front of them. They had not long been there, before they heard a negro's voice, who, as he approached from the house, sung merrily a song, of which only the following lines could be distinguished: “Peep froo de winder; see break o' day; “Run down to riber; canoe gone away. “Put foot in water; water mighty cold; “Hear O'sur call me; hear Missis scold. “O dear! my dear! what shall I do? “My Massa whip me, cause I love you.” The song ceased, and cuffee advanced in silence, but with a heavy swinging step, that rung audibly on the hard ground. As soon as his dusky figure began to be distinguishable, which was not until he was quite near, he was arrested by the sharp challenge of the sentry. “High!” exclaimed the negro, in a tone of amazement and alarm: “Law-Gorramighty! what dis?” “Advance!” said the sentinel, mechanically, “and give the countersign.” “What dat, Massa? I never see sich a ting in my life.” “Advance!” repeated the sentry, bringing his piece down with a rattling sound against his right side. The metal glimmered in the light from the windows. The negro caught the gleam, and, falling flat on his face, roared lustily for mercy. The Sergeant now went to him, raised him up, calmed his fears, and, as soon as he could be made to understand any thing, asked if Lieutenant Whiting was at the house. “I hear 'em say, sir, one mighty grand gentleman went there while ago. Old Tom say, he Mass Douglas' old crony, and Massa and Mass Douglas, and all, mighty glad to see him.” “The devil they are!” said the Sergeant. “Well, I hope they'll be mighty glad to see us, too. I do not care how soon, for this night air is something of the sharpest; and I have drawn better rations than we had at that damned tavern. I say, darkee; the old man keeps good liquor, and plenty of belly-timber, don't he?” “Ah, Lord! Yes, Massa, I reckon he does. But it an't much I knows about it. Old Massa mighty hard man, sir. Poor negur don't see much o' he good ting.” “But, I suppose, he gives his friends a plenty?” “Oh, to be sure, sir! Massa mighty proud. Great gentleman come see him, he an't got nothing too good for him. But poor white folks and poor negur! —pshaw!” “A bad look out for us, Rogers,” said the Sergeant to one of his men. “Damn the old hunks, I hope he don't mean to leave us to bivouack here all night. Well, we must wait our hour, as the Lieutenant told us, and then he'll come back to us, or we have to march to the house. Damn it! I shall be pretty sharp-set by that time, and, if it comes to that, the old gentleman's kitchen and wine-cellar may look out for a storm.” “You talk like you hungry, Massa,” said the negro, in a tone of sympathy. I mighty sorry I an't got nothing to give you.” “But could not you get something, cuffee? Is there no key to your master's cellar and smoke-house besides the one he keeps? Don't you think, now, you could get us some of his old apple-brandy? I hear he has it of all ages.” “Ah, Lord, Massa; dat you may be sure of. I hear old Tom say brandy dare older an he; and he most a hundred. 'Spose I bring you some o' dat, Massa, what you gwine give me?” “Will a quarter do for a bottle of it?” “Law, Massa! why he same like gold. Half a dolla, Massa!” “Well, bring us a bottle of the right old stuff, mind!—and you shall have half a dollar. And see, darkee; cannot you bring us a little cold bread and meat?” “I don't know, Massa, what de cook say. I try her.” “Well, go; and, while your hand is in, help yourself well. If the liquor is good, may be we'll take two or three bottles.” “Well, Massa, I try old Tom. He keep de key. Ah, Lord! Old Massa tink Tom mighty desperate honest; and he tink Tom love him so—better an he own self. He better mind; one o' dese days Tom show him how dat is.” “I don't think you love him much yourself, Sambo.” “Who?—I, Massa? My name Jack, sir. Lord, no sir! What I love him for? Hard work and little bread, and no meat? No, Massa, I love soldier; cause I hear 'em say soldier come after a while, set poor nigur free.” “That is true enough. I hope it will not be long before we set you all free from these damned man-stealers. How would you like to go with us?” “Lord, Massa, you joking. Go wid you? I reckon the old man find it right hard to get somebody to saddle his horse if all our folks was here.” “Well, cuffee, the old man's in hockley by this time; and when we march him off in the morning, you will have nobody to stop you. But bring us the brandy, and then we'll talk about it.” “Ees, Massa! tank ye, Massa! But, Massa, I got two boys big as me, and my brother, and my wife, and all; I don't want to leave them. And, Massa, my boys got some apples. You want some, sir?” “To be sure I do. Bring them along; but mind and bring the brandy, at all events.” The negro disappeared, and the soldiers occupied themselves in discussing the means of making a profitable speculation on their disposition to leave their master. They were still on this topic when they heard Jack returning, with several more. One brought a chunk of fire; another a basket of apples; another one of eggs; a fourth came provided with some cold provisions; Jack himself brandished a couple of bottles of brandy; and one of his boys brought a pint of water and a tin cup. The liquor was tasted, approved, paid for, and eagerly swallowed. A torch of light-wood being kindled, a chaffering commenced, interrupted by occasional allusions to the interesting subjects of slavery, hard masters, and emancipation. The brandy, however, chiefly engaged the attention of the soldiers. The sentry, whose duty was but formal, was permitted to join, as the guns were but a few feet off, just without the gate, which stood open. The light of the torch glittered strongly on the arms, and seemed to make all things distinct, while in fact its unsteady flickering did little more than dazzle their eyes. The negro held it aloft, and, as if to brighten the flame, occasionally waved it to and fro. Suddenly it dropped from his hand into the pail of water, and in an instant the blackness of impenetrable darkness shrouded every eye. At the same moment, a heavy trampling, as from a rush of many feet, was heard without the gate, and a shivering clash from the stack of arms, as if it had fallen down. The soldiers groped their way towards it, feeling where they supposed it to be. They felt in vain. They winked hard, as if to free their eyes from the blinding impression left by the flaring light, then opened them, and looked about. Judge their astonishment, when, as they begun to recover their sight, they found themselves surrounded by a dusky ring, from which issued a voice, not unlike that of their friend Jack, which informed them, in good English, that they were prisoners. The prick of a bayonet on one or two who endeavored to pass through the circle, convinced them that such was the fact; and, after a short parley, they permitted themselves to be marched off, and safely stowed away in a strong out-house. I would not have the reader give the negroes the credit of this stratagem. It had been devised by B—, who knew that he could depend on the address and quick wit of Jack for drawing the soldiers into the snare. All that part of the business had been left to his own discretion. As soon as he had secured the amicable reception of himself and a few others, the rest, dividing into two parties, left the house, and, crossing the fence at some distance from the gate, and on each side of it, advanced stealthily toward it. Here they met, and having arranged themselves for a sudden rush on the stack of arms, an agreed signal was given by a negro who possessed a faculty of mimicking the voices of all animals. 3 † As soon as the light was extinguished, the necessary number rushed forward to the object on which their eyes had been fixed; seized the arms, and, falling back, ranged themselves in a half circle outside of the gate. Those who had been with the soldiers, and who all wore concealed arms, closed in behind them, and completely hemmed them in. B—, in the mean time, who had his reasons for not wishing to be seen, kept aloof; and, as soon as he knew that the soldiers were secured, returned to the house. There, too, he took care not to show himself; and Arthur was advised that he should not, by making his appearance, at all involve himself in what had been done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And, with affection wondrous sensible, He wrung Bassanio's hand, and so they parted. Shakspeare. At day light, all was in motion. Arthur and Virginia, being affectionately dismissed by their friends, were first upon the road, before Lieutenant Whiting was awake. Much of the night had been spent in preparations, and long before sunrise Douglas handed his aunt and cousins into their carriage. His uncle mounted the barouche, with Jack for driver, by whose side old Tom was placed; while the lady's maid took her seat by her single-minded master, with a freedom from which an amalgamationist would have drawn the most pleasing inferences. No other white person was seen; but a body guard of twenty negroes, well armed, and mounted on plough horses, some saddled, some cushioned, and some bare-backed, surrounded the carriages and baggage-wagon. In the midst rode Douglas and his friend on horseback. “You see,” said Mr. Trevor to Whiting, as he took his place in the barouche, “that the part these faithful creatures took in last night's work, drives them into exile as well as me. I must not leave them behind to be the victims of baffled malice. What is to become of my plantation, is a question of less importance. I suppose I may say with Cincinnatus, when honor was forced on him as it is on me, my fields must go untilled this year! You see here, sir, my whole male force. Not one proved recreant.” “This affair is altogether unaccountable to me,” said Whiting to Douglas, as they moved off together; “and this the strangest feature of the whole. Do men, then, act without motives; and against all assignable motives?” “I asked the same question myself last night,” said Douglas, “and was referred to coming events for the answer. I was partly taught, at the same time, to account for what I was told to expect.” “And how can it be accounted for?” “I cannot say I have my lesson perfect; but something was said about the difference of character produced by peculiar training, and habitudes of mind formed by circumstances. For my part, it appears to me that there must be something, by nature, in the moral constitution of the negro, intrinsically different from the white man.” “It would, indeed, seem so,” said Whiting, “if we are to credit what we see. But, in that case, we must reject the authority which tells us that all are of one race.” “So are all dogs,” said Douglas; “and dogs can no more act without motive than man. It depends on temper and character what shall be motives of action. The wolf would be sadly puzzled to judge of the motives of the Newfoundland dog. May not circumstances, which have made the difference between them, have produced the much less difference between the white man and the negro? I have no measure for the effect of such causes. If I am put to choose between rejecting the evidence of my own senses, or the evidence of God's word, or the philosophy which teaches that man is to be considered as a unit, because all of one race, philosophy must go by the board. It may be, that what is best for me, is best for my friend Jack there, and vice versa; but as long as neither of us thinks so, why not leave each to his choice? Besides, there is more room in the world for both of us, than if both always wanted the same things.” A ride of a few hours carried the party across the line into North Carolina. Here they stopped at the first public house; and Mr. Trevor drew up a hasty statement of the events of the night, which should have the effect of acquitting Lieutenant Whiting of all blame, on account of his own escape from the fangs of his enemies. In this he set forth that, 3 † having been warned of the intended prosecution, he had made his preparations accordingly, and that the officer had but fallen into a snare from which no vigilance could have saved him. This he signed, and gave, moreover, a clear acquittance to Lieutenant Whiting for all he had done; and having thus placed him, as far as depended on himself, rectus in curia, he announced to him that he was now at liberty to go whither he would. “And now, sir,” said he, “as the spell which would have made your touch degrading is broken by the State line, let me have the pleasure of taking you by the hand, not only as my nephew's friend, but as one who, in the extremes of victory and defeat, as captor and as prisoner, has borne himself as became a gentleman.” Saying this, he extended his hand, which Whiting grasped with fervor, and they parted as friends cordial and sincere. Douglas accompanied his friend a short distance on his return, the latter walking, and leading his horse. They conversed of the past and the future. “I have been a volunteer in this business,” said Whiting. “I shall not disguise that my friendship for you led me to offer my services, and I fear that no excuse will be received for my failure. There is a spirit somewhere at work, to which I will give no name, that will be implacable at the thought that any advantage may have been lost by my respect for your feelings.” “I am afraid it may prove so,” replied Douglas. “The consequence may be fatal to your advancement in the army, and perhaps you may be driven from it, as I have been. Should it be so, my dear Whiting—but I will not profit so little by the example of delicacy set me while I wore the epaulette, as to say any thing to you now. I would content myself with telling you where I shall be found, if I myself knew. But shall I keep you advised of my movements?” “By all means,” said Whiting. “I shall always wish to know your fate, whether good or ill.” “I know that,” replied Douglas. “But that is not my meaning. Shall I let you know where to find me, in case circumstances should lead you to share my fate?” “Don't ask me that, Trevor. The question implies ideas which I must not entertain. But should such a time as you suppose ever arrive, I shall know where to find you, should my opinions make it right to seek you.” “Then, God bless you, Whiting! That we shall meet again is sure. That we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in the strife of battle, as, in our day dreams, we have so often thought of doing, I cannot doubt.” And thus parted these gallant and generous youths; the one into exile from the country that he loved, the other to return to the service of an unthankful master. A farther ride of a few miles brought our party to the village, in which Mr. Trevor wished to take up his temporary residence. Here they found Mr. B—, who had been engaged in investigating the comforts and capabilities of the different public houses, and having fixed on that he liked best, met Mr. Trevor in the street, and conducted the party to it. The two friends soon drew apart to discuss with the landlord the necessary arrangements for the comfort of the family during their proposed stay. While they were thus engaged, Douglas seated himself, after the manner of the country, in the bar-room; in which, besides some travellers, there was a motley assemblage of the inhabitants of the village, who had come in to stare at and talk about the new comers. By the time Douglas had taken care of the ladies and baggage, they were deep into the merits of the whole party; and, when he entered the room, they were too busy talking to pay any attention to him. The principal interlocutors were three. First, a well-dressed, middle-aged man, whose dapper air and delicate hands bespoke one accustomed to bowing across a counter over lace patterns and painted muslins; and whose style of eloquence was exactly adapted to the praise of such articles. Then there was a coarse, strong man, with a bacon-fed look, plainly, cheaply, and untastefully dressed, in clothes which, by their substantial goodness, indicated at once the wearer's prudence, and the length of his purse. His voice was loud, strong, and self-important, entirely devoid of melody, and incapable of inflection or modulation. His whole appearance showed him to be a substantial planter, ignorant of every thing but corn and tobacco. A huge whip in the hand of the third, together with his dusty and travel-soiled appearance, denoted the driver of a wagon which stood before the door. Their conversation I reserve for the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. If she be not kind to me, What care I how kind she be? Suckling. “I cannot say I like it altogether, Squire,” said the planter. “It may suit my neighbor Jones, here, well enough to have one of them high-headed Roanoke planters to come here with his family, and spend his money. I dare say he will make a pretty good spec out of them; but, for my part, I would rather they would stay at home, and live under their own laws. I ha'nt got no notion, after they saddled that damned rascal Van Buren upon us so long, that now, the minute we have shook him off and made a good government, and good treaties, and all, they should be wanting to have a sop in our pan. If that's what they are after, in rebelling against their government, I don't want to give them no countenance. What we have done, we have done for ourselves, and we have a right to all the good of it. They have fixed their market to their liking, and let it stand so. If we can get thirty dollars for our tobacco, and they cannot get ten, I reckon we ha'nt got nobody to thank for it but ourselves. I dare say, now they see how the thing works, they would be glad enough to share with us, but I see plain enough that all they would get by joining us, we would lose, and may be more too.” “You are right there, Mr. Hobson,” said the merchant; “and that is not all. There's an advantage in buying as well as selling. Now as to this Mr. Trevor, or whatever his name is, coming over here, and buying things cheaper than he could get them at home—why that he is welcome to. Though yu may be sure, neighbor, I don't let him have them as cheap as I sell to you. But as to letting in the Norfolk merchants to all the advantage of our treaty with England, that is another matter. For though, when we deepen the bar at Ocracock, I have no doubt our town down there will be another sort of a place to what Norfolk ever was, yet if Virginia was to join us now, right away, the most of the trade would go to Norfolk again, and they would get their goods there as cheap as we get them here, and may be a little cheaper. So you see it is against my interest as well as yours; and I don't like the thoughts of putting in a crop, and letting another man gather it, any more than you do.” “It would be harder upon me than any of you,” said the wagoner; “for if that was the case, that damned railroad would break up my business, stock and fluke. As it is, there never was such a time for wagoning before. Instead of just hauling the little tobacco that is made here to the end of the railroad, now I have the hauling of the Virginia tobacco, and all, down to Commerce.”[1] [1] The reader will look, in vain, on the map, for the name of this place. It was somewhere on the waters of the Sound, and, doubtless, would have become a place of some consequence, had not the union of Virginia to the Southern Confederacy laid the foundation for a degree of prosperity in Norfolk, which bids fair to make it the first city on the continent. The town of Commerce, of course, went down with the necessity which gave rise to it. It is hard to say whether surprise or disgust most prevailed in the mind of Douglas at hearing these remarks. The idea of the advantages lost to Virginia, by her connexion with the North, had never entered his mind; but still less had he conceived it possible that a sordid desire to monopolize these advantages, could stifle, in the minds of the North Carolineans, every feeling of sympathy with the oppressed and persecuted assertors of the rights of Virginia. The reply of Mr. Hobson to the remark of the wagoner gave him a yet deeper insight into that dark and foul corner of the human heart, where self predominates over all the better affections. “I don't think that's right fair in you wagoners,” said he. “You haul the Virginia tobacco down to Commerce, and when it gets there it is all the same as mine. Now, if it was not for that, I am not so mighty sure but I'd get forty dollars instead of thirty; and I don't like to lose ten dollars to give you a chance to get one.” “It is all one to me,” said the wagoner. “You may just pay me the same for not hauling that they pay me for hauling, or only half as much, and I will not haul another hogshead.” “But if you won't, another will,” said Hobson. “Like enough,” replied the wagoner; “for all trades must live; and if them poor devils get a chance to sell a hogshead or two, instead of leaving it all to rot, you ought not to grudge them that.” “Certainly not,” said the merchant, “for I guess that whatever they get, they take care to lay it all out in goods on this side of the line. So the money stays with us after all, and friend Stubbs's hauling does good to more besides him.” “I see,” said Hobson, “how it does good to you, but none to me.” “But that an't all, Mr. Hobson,” said the landlord, who had entered while this conversation was going on. “Them hot-headed fellows over the line there, like this old Squire Trevor, will be getting themselves into hot water every now and then; and when they run away and come to us, if they did not bring no money, we'd have to feed them free gratis for nothing. Now Stubbs hauls Squire Trevor's tobacco to Commerce, and he gets a good price; and then he gets into trouble, and comes over here to stay with me, and so he is able to pay me a good price; and here it is,” added he, showing a roll of notes. “Still,” said Hobson, “I don't see how that 4 † does me any good. If they were to come here begging, damn the mouthful I'd give them.” “Then you would leave the whole burden on the poor tavern-keepers,” said the landlord. “No—I would not. I would not let them come; or, if they did, just give them up to their own government. If they had not a chance to be running over here, as soon as they got into trouble, they would keep quiet, and never get a chance to separate, and so ruin our business, whether they joined us or no.” “Old Rip is wide awake at last,” said a voice from behind; “but it is to his interest only.” Douglas turned to the voice of the speaker, the tone of which expressed a scorn and derision most acceptable to his feelings. He was a tall and fine looking man, powerfully made, and inclined to be fat, but not at all unwieldy. The half laughing expression of his large, blue eye, and the protrusion of his under lip, spoke his careless contempt of those whose conversation had called forth his sarcasm. The attention of the whole company was drawn to him at the same moment; all looking as if they wished to say something, without knowing what. At length the wagoner spoke, on the well understood principle that, when men talk of what they understand imperfectly, he who knows least should be always first to show his ignorance. “I cannot say I understand rightly what you mean, stranger,” said he; “but I guess, by the cut of your jib, that you are one of them high dons from South Carolina, that always have money to throw away, and think a body ought never to care any more for himself than another. But this business don't consarn you, no how, because these people don't interfere with your cotton crop.” “Yes, but they do, though,” said Hobson; “for if they drive me from tobacco, I shall make cotton. But, if I can keep them out of the tobacco market, I shall be willing to give up the making of cotton to South Carolina.” “Why that is true,” said the stranger, with a sudden change of his countenance, from which he discharged, in a moment, every appearance of intelligence, but that which seemed to reflect the superior wisdom of Mr. Hobson. “That is true,” said he, looking as if making a stupid attempt to think; “I had not thought of that before.” As he said this, he sunk slowly and thoughtfully into a chair, his knees falling far asunder, his arms dropping across his thighs, his body bent forward, and his face turned up toward Mr. Hobson, with the look of one who desires and expects to receive important information. The whole action spoke so eloquently to Mr. Hobson's self-esteem, that he went on, with an air of the most gracious complacency. “You see, stranger, just shutting only a part of the Virginia tobacco out of the market, makes a difference of ten dollars, at the very least, in the price of mine. Now, we used to make a heap of cotton in this country, but we are all going to give it up quite entirely, and then, you see, it stands to reason it will make a difference of five cents a pound, or may be ten, in your cotton.” This interesting proposition was received by the stranger with a sluggish start of dull surprise; from which he sunk again into the same appearance of stolid musing. “To think what a fool I have been,” said he, after a long pause. Then, scratching his head, and twisting in his chair, he added: “You are right. You are right; and the only way to manage the matter is to get your Legislature to pass a law, as you say, to make those fellows stay at home.” “To be sure it would,” said the gratified Hobson; “but then there are so many conceited fellows in the Legislature, with a fool's notion in their heads about taking sides with them that cannot help themselves, that there is no getting any thing done.” “Well,” said the stranger, “this gentleman guessed right when he said I was from South Carolina. So I don't know any thing about your laws here. But I suppose you have no law to hurt a man for taking up one that runs away from the law in Virginia, and carrying him back. I expect old Van would pay well for them.” Hobson looked hard at the stranger, and only answered with that compound motion of the head, which, partaking at once of a shake and a nod, expresses both assent and caution. The landlord and merchant both exclaimed against this suggestion, the one illustrating his argument by the freedom with which his guest had ordered wine from the bar; the other, by his former experience of his liberality as a purchaser of goods, while he kept a store in Mr. Trevor's neighborhood, which he had withdrawn since the revolution. Among the bystanders there was no expression of opinion, but that sort of silence which betokens an idea that what has been said is well worth considering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 † CHAPTER XXVII. Sic vos non vobis. —Virgil. In the meantime, Mr. B— had entered the room, and, hearing the stranger's voice, placed himself at the back of his chair, looking on with a playful smile. He now spoke— “Have you played out the play?” said he. The stranger sprung to his feet in a moment, and, facing B—, caught him by the hand, which he shook with an energy which seemed to threaten dislocation. The two then turned off, and left the room together. “This is most fortunate, my dear sir,” said the stranger; “but, pray tell me, how happens it that I find you here?” “Do you not perceive,” said B—, “that I have a friend in trouble, and that I am here with him? Did you not hear the name of Trevor just now?” “Trevor! No—I did not distinguish the name. What Trevor? Bernard? Is he here? In trouble? About what? I came this far to see you both, and not choosing to go into Virginia, was listening to the conversation of those fellows, in hopes to find some one among them whom I could trust to send with a request that you would both meet me here.” “Here we both are,” said B—, “and here Trevor is like to remain for a while. He has been elected to the Legislature, and they have gotten up a prosecution against him before that iniquitous court of high commission at Washington, to hang him, if they can, or at least to drive him off.” “Can you think him safe here,” asked the stranger, “among such mercenary wretches as those we have just left?” “O yes! You must not judge of this people by those muck-worms. The best of the three is a Yankee tin-pedler, turned merchant. The other two are the worst specimens of their respective species. I dare say there are many more like them, but there are fifty gentlemen of property in this county who would stand by us; and are ready, in their individual capacity, to aid us with purse and sword, whenever we raise our banner.” “But where is Trevor?” said the stranger. “I am impatient to see him.” “We will go to him,” said B—; “but first let me introduce you to a young friend of ours, whom you must receive as a friend. He is the sort of man we should cherish, and, besides that, he has been in trouble on your account. You must understand that he was an officer in the army of the United States, and incurred the mortal displeasure of his master for not joining one of his minions in abuse of you, when the news of your successful negotiation with the British Government was received. Douglas was now called into the room, and introduced to the stranger; and the three gentlemen repaired together to the parlor of Mr. Trevor. A cordial greeting between the two friends, and a sprightly conversation on various topics, ensued; but at length the ladies left the room, and affairs of moment came under discussion. “I am come,” said the stranger, “to learn your plans, and to consult of the best means of affording such aid as we can. When, where, and how, do you mean to move?” “We have carried the elections,” said B—, “so as to be sure of a majority in the Legislature, if they can be freed from the presence of the federal army. But, unless that can be done, our friends here, and many others, will not be permitted to attend, and the weaker brethren will be overawed.” “Of course, then, you will attempt that. What measures do you propose to take?” “None that shall attract observation,” said B—. “It is impossible, at this time, to draw together any force which might not at once be overwhelmed by the army at Richmond. We are, therefore, obliged to lie quiet, and suffer our people to see for themselves the advantages they are losing. They are beginning to understand this. They perceive that your commercial arrangements are making their neighbors in this State rich, while they can sell nothing that they make, and are obliged to give double price for all they buy. The abatement of duty in the English ports on your tobacco, and the corresponding abatement of your impost on British manufactures, is driving trade, money, and even population, to the South; and nothing but separation from the northern States can prevent our whole tobacco country from being deserted. This, of course, will open the eyes of the people in time, and we hope, that when the Legislature meets, it may be practicable to draw together, on the sudden, such a force as may drive the enemy from Richmond, and give time at least to adjourn to a place where they may deliberate in safety. “Is there any such place in the State?” asked the stranger. “I am not aware that there is at this moment, but such a one must be provided for the emergency, should it arise.” “And what means do you propose to use for that purpose?” “There is a section of the State,” replied B—, “where circumstances enable me to exert a powerful influence, and where, from its localities, a partisan corps might maintain itself, in spite of the enemy, and might give so decided a disposition to the surrounding population, as to establish perfect security within a pretty extensive district.” “But is there no danger,” said the southron, “that such a corps would induce an increase of the force at Richmond and elsewhere, and so make the first step in your enterprise more difficult?” “It would have that effect,” said B—, “were not the scene of action remote from Richmond, and unless the operations of the corps were so conducted as to create no alarm for that place. Of course, there should be no appearance of concert with this lower country; and, so far from increasing apprehension of our ulterior designs, our failure to rally to the banner of a successful leader might disarm suspicion.” “Then it seems that all you want is a Marion, a Sumpter, or a Pickens?” “We have such a one,” said B—; “and it is well that you are here with us to aid in consecrating him to his task. Here he stands.” As he said this, he laid his hand, solemnly, gently and respectfully, on the head of the astonished Douglas. “What, I!” exclaimed he. “For God's sake, my dear sir, what qualification have I for such service?” “Courage, talent, address, and military education,” said B—, with a quiet smile. “And where should I find men willing to be commanded by me, in an enterprize which, of course, supposes the absence of all legal authority?” “Suppose them provided,” said B—. “Is there any other difficulty to be removed?” “I should still be bound to enquire,” said Douglas, “what good end is proposed, before I could agree to enter on a course of conduct which nothing but the most important considerations could justify.” “All that you have a right to ask, and are bound to understand clearly. You would have understood it long before this, but that as long as one shred remained of the tie that bound you to the army of the United States, a delicate respect to you imposed silence on your uncle and myself. You now require that we show you some prevailing reason why Virginia should detach herself from the Northern Confederacy, and either form a separate State, which we do not propose, or unite herself to the South, which we do. Is not that your difficulty?” “It is,” replied Douglas. “I have long been sensible that there were views of the subject which my situation had hidden from me, and have frequently lamented (while I was grateful for) the resolute reserve which my friends have maintained. “You must be sensible,” said B—, “that the southern States, including Virginia, are properly and almost exclusively agricultural. The quality of their soil and climate, and the peculiar character of their laboring population, concur to make agriculture the most profitable employment among them. Apart from the influence of artificial causes, it is not certain that any labor can be judiciously taken from the soil to be applied to any other object whatever. When Lord Chatham said that America ought not to manufacture a hob-nail for herself, he spoke as a true and judicious friend of the colonies. The labor necessary to make the hob-nail, if applied to the cultivation of the earth, might produce that for which the British manufacturer would gladly give two hob-nails. By coming between the manufacturer and the farmer, and interrupting this interchange by perverse legislation, the Government broke the tie which bound the colonies to the mother country. “When that tie was severed and peace established, it was the interest of both parties that this interchange should be restored, and put upon such a footing as to enable each, reciprocally, to obtain for the products of his own labor as much as possible of the products of the labor of the other. “Why was not this done? Because laws are not made for the benefit of the people, but for that of their rulers. The monopolizing spirit of the landed aristocracy in England led to the exclusion of our bread-stuffs, and the necessities of the British treasury tempted to the levying of enormous revenue from our other agricultural products. The interchange between the farmer and manufacturer was thus interrupted. In part it was absolutely prevented; the profit being swallowed up by the impost, the inducement was taken away. “What did the American Government under these circumstances? Did they say to Great Britain, `relax your corn-laws; reduce your duties on tobacco; make no discrimination between our cotton and that from the East Indies; and we will refrain from laying a high duty on your manufactures. You will thus enrich your own people, and it is by no means sure that their increased prosperity may not give you, through the excise and other channels of revenue, more than an equivalent for the taxes we propose to you to withdraw.' “Did we say this? No. And why? Because, in the northern States, there was a manufacturing interest to be advanced by the very course of legislation most fatal to the South. With a dense population, occupying a small extent of barren country, with mountain streams tumbling into deep tide-water, and bringing commerce to the aid of manufactures, they wanted nothing but a monopoly of the southern market to enable them to enrich themselves. The alternative was before us. To invite the great European manufacturer to reciprocate the benefits of free trade, whereby the South might enjoy all the advantages of its fertile soil and fine climate, or to transfer these advantages to the North, by meeting Great Britain on the ground of prohibition and exaction. The latter was preferred, because to the interest of that section, which, having the local majority, had the power. “Under this system, Great Britain has never wanted a pretext for her corn-laws, and her high duties on all our products. Thus we sell all we make, 5 † subject to these deductions, which, in many instances, leave much less to us than what goes into the British treasury. “Here, too, is the pretext to the Government of the United States for their exactions in return. The misfortune is, that the southern planter had to bear both burthens. One half the price of his products is seized by the British Government, and half the value of what he gets for the other half is seized by the Government of the United States. “This they called retaliation and indemnification. It was indemnifying an interest which had not been injured, by the farther injury of one which had been injured. It was impoverishing the South for the benefit of the North, to requite the South for having been already impoverished for the benefit of Great Britain. Still it was `indemnifying ourselves.' Much virtue in that word, `ourselves.' It is the language used by the giant to the dwarf in the fable; the language of the brazen pot to the earthen pot; the language of all dangerous or interested friendship. “I remember seeing an illustration of this sort of indemnity in the case of a woman who was whipt by her husband. She went complaining to her father, who whipped her again, and sent her back. `Tell your husband,' said he, `that as often as he whips my daughter, I will whip his wife.”' “But what remedy has been proposed for these things?” asked Douglas. “A remedy has been proposed and applied,” replied B—. “The remedy of legislation for the benefit, not of the rulers, but of the ruled.” “But in what sense will you say that our legislation has been for the benefit of the rulers alone? Are we not all our own rulers?” “Yes,” replied B—, “if you again have recourse to the use of that comprehensive word `WE,' which identifies things most dissimilar, and binds up, in the same bundle, things most discordant. If the South and North are one; if the Yankee and the Virginian are one; if light and darkness, heat and cold, life and death, can all be identified; then WE are our own rulers. Just so, if the State will consent to be identified with the Church, then WE pay tithes with one hand, and receive them with the other. While the Commons identify themselves with the Crown, `WE' do but pay taxes to ourselves. And if Virginians can be fooled into identifying themselves with the Yankees—a fixed tax-paying minority, with a fixed tax-receiving majority—it will still be the same thing; and they will continue to hold a distinguished place among the innumerable WES that have been gulled into their own ruin ever since the world began. It is owing to this sort of deception, played off on the unthinking multitude, that, in the two freest countries in the world, the most important interests are taxed for the benefit of lesser interests. In England, a country of manufacturers, they have been starved that agriculture may thrive. In this, a country of farmers and planters, they have been taxed that manufacturers may thrive. Now I will requite Lord Chatham's well-intentioned declaration, by saying that England ought not to make a barrel of flour for herself. I say, too, that if her rulers and the rulers of the people of America were true to their trust, both sayings would be fulfilled. She would be the work-house, and here would be the granary of the world. What would become of the Yankees? As I don't call them WE, I leave them to find the answer to that question.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. Such is the aspect of this shore; 'Tis Greece—but living Greece no more. Byron. The impression made on Douglas by these observations was so strong and so obvious, that his friend paused and left him to meditate upon them. Some minutes elapsed before he made any reply. When he did speak, he acknowledged the existence and magnitude of the grievance, and again enquired, with increased solicitude, what remedy had been found. “You heard what passed in the bar-room, just now,” said the stranger. “I did,” replied Douglas; “and I was as much surprised at the facts hinted at, as disgusted at the sentiments of the speakers.” “Then your surprise must have been extreme,” said the other; “for I hardly know which amused me most: their unblushing display of selfish meanness, or the glow of indignation in your countenance, which showed how little you know of this world of 5 † philanthropy and benevolence that we live in. But had you no suspicion of the cause of those enviable advantages which these sons of Mammon are so anxious to monopolize?” “Not at all, and hence my surprise; for I had supposed heretofore, that, between the two States, all the advantage lay on the side of Virginia.” “You judged rightly,” replied the other. “In the way of commerce, nature has done nothing for the one, and every thing for the other. But the conversation you have heard is a proof that the sand which chokes the waters of the Sound is a trivial obstacle, in comparison with the legislative barriers which have shut out prosperity from the noble Chesapeake. Look at your rivers and bay, and you will see that Virginia ought to be the most prosperous country in the world. Look at the ruins which strew the face of your lower country, the remains of churches and the fragments of tombstones, and you will see that she once was so. Ask for the descendants of the men whose names are sculptured on those monuments, and their present condition will tell you that her prosperity has passed away. Then ask all history. Go to the finest countries in the world—to Asia Minor, to Greece, to Italy; ask what has laid them desolate, and you will receive but one answer, `misgovernment.”' “But may not the fault be in the people themselves?” asked Douglas. “The fault of submitting to be misgoverned, certainly. But no more than that. Let the country enjoy its natural advantages, and they who are too ignorant or too slothful to use them will soon give place to others of a different character. What has there been to prevent the Yankee from selling his barren hills at high prices and coming South, where he might buy the fertile shores of the Chesapeake for a song? No local attachment, certainly; for his home is every where. What is there now to prevent the planter of this neighborhood from exchanging his thirsty fields for the rich and long coveted low grounds of James River or Roanoke, in Virginia? Are these people wiser, better, more energetic and industrious than they were twelve months ago, that their lands have multiplied in value five fold? Is it your uncle's fault, that, were he now at home the tame slave of power, he could hardly give away his fine estate? The difference is, that this country now enjoys its natural advantages, while Virginia remains under the crushing weight of a system devised for the benefit of her oppressors.” “I see the effect,” said Douglas. “But tell me, I beseech you, the cause of this change in your condition here.” “The cause is free trade.” “And how has that been obtained?” “I will answer that,” said B—; “because my friend's modesty might restrain him from giving the true answer. It has been obtained by intelligence, manly frankness, and fair dealing. It has been obtained by offering to other nations terms most favorable to their peculiar and distinctive interests, in consideration of receiving the like advantage. Instead of nursing artificial interests to rival the iron and cotton fabrics, and the shipping of England, the wine of France, the silk and oil of Italy, and enviously snatching at whatever benefit nature may have vouchsafed to other parts of the world, this people only ask to exchange for these things their own peculiar productions. A trade perfectly free, totally discharged from all duties, would certainly be best for all. But revenue must be had, and the impost is the best source of revenue. No State can be expected to give that up. But it has been found practicable so to regulate that matter as reduce the charges which have heretofore incumbered exchanges to a mere trifle.” “How has that been effected?” asked Douglas. “If that question were to be answered in detail,” said B—, “I should leave the answer to him by whom the details have been arranged. I will give you the outline in a few words. These States were first driven to think of separation by a tariff of protection. Their federal constitution guards against it by express prohibition, and by requiring that the impost, like the tax laws of Virginia, should be annual. “They have felt the danger to liberty from excessive revenue. Their constitution requires that the estimates of the expense of the current year shall be made the measure of revenue to be raised for that year. The imports of the preceding year are taken as a basis of calculation, and credit being given for any surplus in the treasury, a tariff is laid which, on that basis, would produce the sum required.” “Then there can never be any surplus for an emergency,” said Douglas. “Always,” replied B—; “in the right place, and the only safe place,—the pockets of a prosperous people. There is no place in the treasury to keep money. The till of the treasury has a hole in the bottom, and the money always finds its way into the pockets of sharpers, parasites, man-worshippers, and pseudo patriots. But let that pass. You see that a small revenue alone will probably be wanting, and being raised annually, the tariff can be annually adjusted. “Now, what says justice, as to the revenue to be raised by two nations on the trade between the two, seeing that it is equally levied on the citizens of both?” “On that hypothesis each should receive an equal share of it,” said Douglas. “Precisely so,” answered B—; “and let these terms be held out to all nations, and if one will not accept them another will. On this principle a system of commercial arrangements has been set on foot which, by restoring to these States the benefit of their natural advantages, is at once producing an effect which explains their former prosperity. It places in stronger relief the evils of the opposite system to Virginia, and really leaves her, while she retains her present connexion with the North, without any resource. Tobacco she cannot sell at all. Invita natura, she will have to raise cotton to supply the beggared manufactories of the North, from which she will not receive in return the third part as much of the manufactured article as the Carolina planter will get for his. This is her fate. She sees it, and would throw off the yoke. But her northern masters see it too. She is all that remains to them of their southern dependencies, which, though not their colonies, they have so long governed as colonies. Take her away, and they are in the condition of the wolf when there are no sheep left. Wolf eat wolf, and Yankee cheat Yankee. This they will guard against by all means lawful and unlawful, for Virginia alone mitigates the ruin that their insatiate rapacity has brought upon them. They will hold on to her with the gripe of death; and she must and will struggle to free herself, as from death. “And now, how say you? Are you prepared to do your part in furtherance of this object?” “I am,” replied Douglas promptly; “and I now eagerly ask you to show me the means by which I can advance it.” “You asked for men,” said B—, “and you shall have them. They are already provided, and want but a leader.” “But what authority can I have to be recognized as such?” “You have heard your uncle, aunt, or cousins, speak of Jacob Schwartz.” “I believe I have; but what can such a fellow have to do with such affairs as we now speak of. Is he not an ignorant clown?” “He is all that,” said B—. “But he writes as good a hand as Marshal Saxe, and has probably read as many books as Cincinnatus. But to speak seriously, he is no common clown. I picked him up, nearly forty years ago, a little, dirty, ragged boy, without money, without friends, without education, and without principles. All these wants I found means to supply, except that of education, which to him would be quite superfluous. But he now has money sufficient, and friends without number; and, what is better still, he has become an honest man, and discharges the duties of one none the worse for having had a pretty large experience in knavery. Such as he is, he is bound to me by gratitude, such as few men are capable of. More than a dozen years ago, he followed the bent of early habit, and retired to his native mountains, where he has married, and lives after the manner of the country, as if he were worth nothing in the world but his rifle. He has a good deal of money, which I manage for him; and as he has no taste for extravagance of any sort, and is generous as a king, he always has a dollar to spare a friend. “When I tell you that the people of that district see so little money that they always count it by four-pence-half-pennies, you will readily believe that a little help goes a great way. They don't see that Schwartz has any property; but their opinion of his sagacity and enterprize takes away all wonder at the fact, that he is always able, as well as ready, to give aid to a friend at time of need. You will of course infer, that his influence among them is very great. Now that, and all his faculties of body, mind, and purse, are at my command. He is aware of the state of public affairs; adopts all my views, as far as he can understand them, and beyond that point trusts me implicitly. It is through his instrumentality that the minds of the mountaineers of that district are prepared for action at this moment. No force is actually organized, but every thing is ready for the emergency. The dispositions of the people, and the strong fastnesses of the country, will make it a secure retreat to a partisan corps. The materials for such a corps may be found in part among the inhabitants. A nucleus is all that is wanting, and to that all the persecuted and distressed, from every quarter, will gather.” “You show me, then,” said Douglas, “that you already have all you want—men and a leader. Your friend Schwartz must be the very man to command those fellows, and might not like to submit to the authority of another.” “He is not the man to command,” said B—, “because he could not keep up intelligence with other parts of the country, though as a medium of intelligence there is none better. Indeed he cannot be spared from that branch of service. Besides, though he might command his neighbors, you will be joined by men who will not submit to be commanded by any but a gentleman. As to any reluctance on his part, go to him in my name, or in that of your uncle or aunt, and you command him, body and soul. You will find all his faculties devoted to your service, without envy, jealousy, or grudging; and you will do well to use his mind more than his body. In many particulars he is one of the most efficient men in the world; and as he perfectly understands himself, and knows what he is fit for, you may always leave him to choose his own function, and to execute it in his own way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 † CHAPTER XXIX. The heath this night must be my bed, The bracken curtain for my head, My lullaby the warder's tread, Far, far, from Love and thee, Mary! “I think,” said Douglas, “I now understand your general purpose, and the means to be placed at my disposal. Let me now know your plan of operations. What am I to do, and when?” “The task I propose to myself,” replied B—, “is one which requires that I keep myself out of harm's way, and free from all suspicion, until the time shall come; when I propose to act a part which shall make me a conspicuous mark for the malice or policy of our enemies. Hence I affect to live, and keep myself as much as possible on this side of the line. What you do there must be done in such a way as to indicate no connexion with me. I therefore propose that you accompany my friend here to South Carolina, where you may derive much benefit from seeing the first men in that State, with whom he will make you acquainted. From thence I would have you address letters to your friends (especially those in the army) so worded as to lead them to attribute your change of opinions (which should be made to seem progressive) to the influence of these new associations. A few weeks will be sufficient for this purpose, and you may return to Virginia early in the summer. Here,” continued B—, pointing to a map which hung in the room, “is the point at which you will enter the State, and here will be the principal scene of your operations. You will there find Schwartz, to whom you shall be properly accredited, and from whom you will learn the resources to be placed at your command, and the capabilities of the country. “Now observe. Our object is to organize a small force, under which the district may be protected in declaring for the Independence of Virginia, and prepared to afford a place of refuge to the Legislature, should they be driven from Richmond, before they have time to organize the operations of the Government. Of course, they must have an opportunity to assemble there, if but for a day. This it must be our care to secure, by a sudden movement from the midland counties on the southern boundary, and in this we may need your co-operation. On that point we shall take care to keep you advised. “Now our first object being to free Richmond from the presence of the federal army, at the moment the Legislature is to meet, we must be careful to cause no alarm for the safety of that place. Any movement in that direction would produce a concentration of force there, and increase our difficulties. You should, therefore, be careful so to shape your operations as rather to call the attention of the enemy to other points; and if you can make them of sufficient importance to draw detachments from Richmond, a double purpose will be answered. You will have no cause to fear any force that can be brought against you. Your field of operations affords situations which may defy assault, and, the line of North Carolina being at your back, you may, at any moment, cross it and disband for a time. “But I am not sure whether our end may not be answered best by giving to all your operations such a character as may exclude the idea of any political object. As none of those who are conspicuous as malcontents in the lower country will join you, this deception will not be difficult. In beating up the quarters of the troops near you, you may seem to act but in self-defence; and should you extend your blow so far as Lynchburg, your mountaineers will hardly fail to levy such contributions on the camp-followers, and Yankee pedlars there, (who call themselves merchants,) as to give the measure the appearance of a mere marauding expedition.” “I am not so very sure,” replied Douglas, “that I should like to mix my little reputation as a soldier and a gentleman with an affair of that sort.” “I am not suggesting any thing contrary to the laws of war,” said B—. “The violation of them would be but in appearance. Care would be taken to indemnify any who might be wronged, whenever it shall be expedient for you to throw off the mask. As to any temporary misconstruction, your name would connect you with your uncle, and, through him, with me and all our friends; and moreover, would whet the malice of your worthy friends, the Bakers, who would move heaven and earth to circumvent you. Better, therefore, to drop the last name. Archibald Douglas is name enough to satisfy the ambition of any reasonable man, at least until he can cap it with a yet more honorable addition, if that be possible.” While this conversation was going on, there was some appearance of embarrassment about Douglas, which did not escape the observation of his uncle. At length he said to him, in an under tone, that, before carrying the matter under discussion any farther, he would be glad to have a few words with him in private. “I understand your wish,” said the old gentleman, aloud; “it shall be indulged.” “I suspect you mistake me,” said Douglas, coloring very high. “Not at all,” replied the other. “You only suppose so because you do not know that one of my friends here received his wife in marriage at my hands, and that the other stood father to mine. Hence I 6 † have no such reserves with them as you may suppose. Now, do I understand you?” “I dare say you do,” replied Douglas, blushing yet more deeply. “Then I say, again, your wish shall be indulged. You shall not leave us until you are fully established in all the rights which it is mine to confer. But you must suppress your raptures until you hear the conditions. Our plan requires secrecy, and, above all, that there should be no appearance of concert between you and us, and no cause to suspect it. This thing, therefore, must be absolutely private; no witnesses but those here present, and your aunt, and Lucia; and in the next moment your foot must be in the stirup. Are you content?” “Content!” said Douglas. “Indeed I am not; but I see that you are acting upon a concerted plan, and that all expostulation must be vain. Let me at least see Delia now.” “I suspect she has gone to bed,” said Mr. T—. “Retired! I believe is the word introduced by our Yankee school-mistresses, whose prurient imaginations are shocked at the name of a bed. Poor girl, she was glad to retire, in the plain English sense of the word, as soon as we got here, and, I dare say, has been in bed half an hour. She and your aunt were on active service all last night, while you were keeping a snoring watch over our friend Whiting. Come, my boy! You shall not infect her with the fever of your brain to night. If you cannot sleep, it is no reason why she should not. And now let us turn again to other matters.” “The next question, then,” said the southron, “is how we can aid you? By sword, or tongue, or pen, or purse?” “By purse as much as you please,” said B—. “Our young friend here will need a small military chest, which we have no means of filling. As to the rest, keep out of the scrape. We wish to join you in peace, and then remain at peace, which will not be, if you strike a blow in our behalf now. As much individual aid as you please to our rendezvous just before the first Monday in December. A thousand independent volunteers, pour le coup, would be welcome. In the meantime, if you can send our young friend here a promising young officer from your military school, to be his second in command, it is all we would ask. Of course, he will come as of his own head, for you must not seem to have any thing to do with the matter.” Many other topics connected with our subject were discussed, but I deem it unadvisable to speak of more than is necessary to explain the subsequent situation of the parties. When they met again at breakfast, the swimming eye and changing cheek of Delia told that she had been made acquainted with all that had passed. The countenance of Douglas beamed with high excitement, at once pleasant and painful. A glance of triumphant encouragement to Delia, and her answering tearful smile, showed that they perfectly understood each other. Indeed it was time they should, for it had been settled that B—, who was a resident and justice of the peace of the county, should perform the marriage ceremony, according to the unceremonious law of North Carolina, immediately after breakfast. As soon as it was over, they adjourned to the parlor, where B—, drawing Delia to him, seated her on his knee. “I don't half like this business,” said he. “I have no mind to take an active part in giving up my own little girl to this young fellow. I am too old to think of loving and fighting all in a breath, as he does, and I thought to wait till the wars were over, and here he comes and cuts me out. But I am determined to do nothing in prejudice of my claim, until I find that I have no chance. Young man,” added he, in a tone gradually changing from playful to serious, “do you love this dear girl with that faithful, single-hearted love, which man owes to a woman who gives him all her heart, and entrusts to him all her happiness, and all her hopes?” As he said this he took the hand of Douglas, and went on: “Do you thus love her, and will you in good faith manifest this love, by being to her a true and devoted husband, in every change and vicissitude of life, so long as life shall last? Answer me, Douglas,” he continued, with a voice approaching to sternness, and a fixed and searching look, while he strongly grasped the young man's hand. “Assuredly I will,” said Douglas, somewhat hurt. “And you, dear,” said B—, resuming his kind and playful tone, “do you love this young fellow in like sort, and will you, on your part, be to him thus faithful as his wife?” While B— said this, the blushing Delia tried to disengage herself. But he detained her, and caught the hand with which she endeavored to loosen his from her waist, and held it fast. At length she hid her face on his neck, whispering: “You know I do. You know I will.” “Then God bless you, my children,” said B—, bringing their hands together and grasping both firmly in one of his; “for you are married as fast as the law can tie you.” In a moment the whole party were on their feet, each expressing a different variety of surprise. Douglas was the first to understand his situation fully, as appeared by his springing forward and catching his bride to his bosom, imprinting on her pure cheek the kiss that holy nature prompts, and that all the caprices of fashion (thank God!) can never shame. From him she escaped into the arms of her mother, who, caressing her with murmured tenderness, looked half reproachfully at B—. Then smiling through the tear that filled her large blue eye, she shook her finger at him, and said, “Just like you! Just like you!” “Fairly cheated you of your scene, Margaret. All the matronly airs, and maidenly airs, that you and Delia have been rehearsing this morning, gone for nothing. And there is dear little Lucia crying as if to break her heart, because sister Delia was married before she could fix her pretty little face for the occasion. Never mind, dear! When your turn comes there will be less hurry, and you shall have a ceremony as long as the whole liturgy. Well, Douglas, you will not quarrel with me, I am sure; and I think Delia will forgive me for the trick I played her. You have but an hour to stay together, and where was the sense of giving that up to the flutter and agitation of a deferred ceremony? I suspect if I were always to manage the matter in this way, I should have my hands as full of business as the dentist that used to conjure people's teeth out of their mouths without their knowing it, while he was pretending just to fix his instrument. But go, my children. Empty your full hearts into each other's bosoms, and thank me for the privilege.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXX. —Gathering tears and tremblings of distress; And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago, Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness: And there were sudden partings, such as press The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs, Which ne'er might be repeated: Who could guess If ever more should meet those mutual eyes? Byron. And so it was. I can add nothing to the language of the poet. I can supply nothing to the imagination of the reader. Thus Douglas and Delia parted. He accompanied his new acquaintance to the southern capital; he there met with men whose names live and will live in the history of their country, and whose memories will be honored while virtue is held in reverence among men. From these, and especially from the accomplished gentleman to whose friendship he had been introduced by his uncle and Mr. B—, he received such lights as dispelled every shadow of doubt from his mind. The wrongs of Virginia, her rights and her remedies, became the subject of all his thoughts, and he burned with impatience for the time when he might draw his sword on her behalf, and turn to her use, as he had expressed it, the lessons learned in the school of her oppressors. That time at length arrived. Returning by the upper road which skirts the foot of the mountains, he re-entered Virginia nearly at the spot to which his brother had gone in quest of him. There, as he had been taught to expect, he found Schwartz, whose reception of him fully justified the assurances of B—. To that gentleman he showed unbounded devotion, delighted to speak of favors received at his hands, and of “moving accidents by flood and field,” which they had encountered together. Next to B—, in his estimation, stood Mrs. Trevor; then Delia, for whom when a child he had formed a passionate attachment; and last, Mr. Trevor himself, whom, after the rest, he respected and admired above all human beings. A hint from B— that Douglas was the husband of Delia placed him at once in the same catalogue of worthies, and from the first moment he devoted himself not less to his personal service than to the advancement of the common cause. He had already organized a small corps, the command of which he unreservedly surrendered, making it his constant study to recommend the new commander to the confidence of the men. No man could deserve it better, or was better qualified to win it. Frank, affable, generous and kind, his deportment was marked by that self-respectful courtesy which has all the good effect of dignity, without ever passing by that name. With nothing repulsive, austere, or cold in his demeanor, he was a man whose orders no soldier would question, whose displeasure no gentleman would choose to incur, whose feelings no friend, however careless, would wound. Liberally supplied with money by his southern friends, and instructed by Schwartz in the judicious use of it, he took effectual measures to prevent distress in the families of his followers. A small sum amply satisfied their simple wants, and his men had the satisfaction of knowing that their families suffered nothing by their absence from their little farms. Beside the small embodied corps I have mentioned, the whole population of that warlike district were placed under a sort of organization, so that, while they pursued their occupations of hunting or farming, they were prepared, at any moment, to join an expedition or to resist an attack. Schwartz, who knew the country, inch by inch, made Douglas acquainted with all its strengths and all its passes, so that he soon became an expert woodsman, and an active mountaineer. His first care was to select a place for a stationary camp. For this purpose he chose a position strong by nature, which he made nearly impregnable. He next provided horses enough to mount a part of his corps. For these the rich herbage of the mountains afforded abundant subsistence during the summer months. 7 † Of ammunition there was no stint. The lead mines were just at his back, beyond the Alleghany. Powder is made of good quality in all that region, and the quantity necessary for the rifle is so small, that the rifleman may be said to carry a hundred lives in his powder-horn. Of provisions he had plenty, though wanting many things deemed necessary in a regular army. But the pure air of the mountains, and the exercise of hunting and scouting, preserved the health of the men, without tents, or salt, or vinegar, or vegetables of any kind. Venison and beef, dried in the sun, or over the fire by the process called jerking, was prepared in the season of abundance for winter use, and proved the best sort of food for a marauding corps. Light, compact, and nutritious, there is no diet on which a man can travel so far or fight so hard. Nothing now remained but to make his enemy feel him. Stooping from his mountain fastness, he soon broke up all the military posts in the adjacent counties; so that, in a few weeks, not a blue-coat was to be seen on the south side of Staunton river. Freed from the presence of their enemy, the people were found ready to rise en masse. He dissuaded them from doing more than to put themselves in readiness for action, to furnish him needed supplies, for which he paid fairly, and to give him notice of the approach of the enemy. For this purpose he established a sort of half military organization, and had it in his power to increase his little force to five times its number in a few days. His strength being thus adapted to any occasion which could be expected to offer, after sweeping away the enemy from the south side of the river, he proceeded to break up the posts in the counties on the northern bank. In the end, though the enemy were nominally in possession of all the country between James river and Roanoke, they held no post higher than Lynchburg, nor any farther south than Farmville. Above this last place, their scouts and foraging parties showed themselves occasionally, but never ventured to leave the banks of James river for more than a single night. At Lynchburg, not long before the time at which our story commences, two companies had been posted. As Douglas had never shown a force of more than a hundred men, no fear of an attack on that point was entertained. But suddenly collecting a number of auxiliaries, he struck at them, drove them from their post, enriched his men with every thing that the laws of war permitted him to seize, and retreated to his strong-hold in the mountains. The supplies of arms, ammunition, clothing, and blankets, thus procured, put him in condition to increase his corps, if necessary. Thus, at the time of which we speak, having little more than a hundred men embodied, he could have marched five times that number to Richmond; and, for any service near at hand, could have commanded a yet larger force. Though unprovided with many of the conveniences of military life, they were not deficient in essentials. There was “not a bit of feather in his host,” nor drum, nor trumpet, nor banner. But there were stout hearts, and strong hands, and fleet limbs, and good rifles, and knives and tomahawks; and that system and harmony which spring from a sense of danger, a high purpose, and confidence in a leader. To the listening ear, a whisper speaks louder than a trumpet to the heedless. To the trusting heart, the chieftain's voice supersedes the spirit-stirring drum. While Douglas thus maintained his position among the mountains, it became a sort of Cave of Adullam. His little corps was a nucleus to which the discontented and persecuted gathered continually. His embodied force was increased, while the organization of the neighboring population became more perfect, their confidence firmer, their zeal more ardent. So effectually had he broken the power of the Central Government in that quarter, that it had been deemed expedient to throw a much larger force into Lynchburg, to curb his progress in that direction, and to restrain the disaffected in the counties along the north bank of James river. Could he have co-operated with the friends of Virginia there, it was not clear that the flame might not spread on and on, in the direction of Washington, until the very seat of empire might be unsafe. Hence a regiment had been detached from the army at Richmond, and another from the North, originally destined for that place, was turned aside to Lynchburg. Aware of these movements, Douglas had no doubt that the purpose of such an assemblage of force was not merely preventive. He saw that attempts would be made to recover the ground which the enemy had lost on the south side of James river; and that, by remaining strictly on the defensive, he might be forced to withdraw his embodied force to their mountain strong-hold, and not only lose the aid of his irregulars, but give them up to the vengeance of the enemy. Under these circumstances, attack was the most effectual form of defence, and boldness was true prudence. The time, too, was at hand for the decisive movement, in the lower counties, for the relief of Richmond. The desired diversion had been effected, and Douglas found himself capable of bringing into the field a force, the presence of which would be no inconsiderable aid to that about to assemble below. To strike at his enemy therefore, to overwhelm him, if possible, and, if not, to elude him and fall down to the assistance of B—, seemed to him the surest plan for preserving the safety and independence even of the mountain region. If successful, every desirable end would be accomplished. Even should he fail, his duty to the faithful yeomanry and peasantry of that devoted section, was rather to draw the enemy away after him toward Richmond, than by 7 † falling directly back, or even by remaining where he was, to invite them to overrun the country which had afforded him such zealous and efficient co-operation. Influenced by these considerations, Douglas had despatched Schwartz to lay them before B—, and receive his instructions. He had long ago recognized him as the person of whom his aunt had said that “the destiny of Virginia depended on him.” He had received at his hands the sort of authority which he wielded, now indeed by his own personal influence and character, but originally as the trusted representative of B—. He had no mind to shake off that character. He had seen that, by means not exactly understood, that gentleman commanded resources, both at home and abroad, which enabled him to meditate plans, in which all the operations of Douglas's corps, however brilliant, were but circumstances of less importance in themselves than in their relations. Schwartz was the sole medium of communication between the two. With nothing in his appearance to attract attention—nothing in his manners or common style of conversation betokening powers superior to those of any other peasant—his intelligence and fidelity supplied the place of letters. He understood every thing, and forgot nothing that was said to him. He therefore carried no papers, and passed unsuspected through the country, amusing with the most harmless gossip, all he chanced to fall in with. He was a man who knew how to have business any where, and at any moment; and he passed along more like a sparrow hopping from twig to twig, pecking at a berry here and a leaf there, and never seeming to have an ulterior object, than with the strong-winged flight which indicates a distant and important destination. In one of Arthur's visits to Lucia, (his betrothal to whom was no longer a secret in her father's family,) he was made acquainted with the history of Douglas's marriage. He was also entrusted with the important information that the gallant leader, with whose exploits the country rung, and whom his imagination had endued with almost superhuman powers, was his own best beloved brother. He was instantly on fire to join him, and Schwartz was instructed to convey to him the necessary intelligence; and, if possible, to fall in with him on the way. But he had been turned aside by objects of higher moment on his return, and Arthur had got ahead of him. Having ascertained this fact in the county of Charlotte, where their roads came together, Schwartz travelled hard to overtake him; left his tired horse at the entrance of the defile, and, following on foot, came up with him as we have seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXI. It is, that she will cherish the renown Of noble deeds, achieved her name to grace And prize the heart that beat for her alone, In Glory's triumph, or in Death's embrace. Anonymous. Let us now return to the deep glen, at the bottom of which we left our friend Arthur, accompanied by his mountain guide. Schwartz was welcomed with cordial joy by his comrades, and, having asked for the Captain, was told he was in his tent. Arthur looked around in vain for a tent, but saw none. The beetling crags on both sides of the dell seemed to be the only shelter that the place afforded. But against the rock, a hundred yards below, and directly beneath the spot from which Schwartz had given notice of his presence, hung a piece of tent-cloth. One edge of this was tacked to a pole which lay horizontally against the rocky wall, the ends being supported by forks about ten feet long. This proved to be a sort of door to a wide-mouthed cavernous recess in the rock, deep enough to afford room for the few little conveniences which an officer can expect to keep about him in active service. Approaching this, Schwartz lifted the corner, and our travellers stood in the presence of Douglas. He was seated at a coarse table, poring over a rude manuscript map, and did not lift his head until he heard the word `brother' uttered by the well-known voice of Arthur. In a moment they were in each other's arms, and, in the next, the new-comer was overwhelmed with questions about his father, mother, and various friends. Some indeed were not named; for, though Schwartz was in the secret of the fact, he was incapable of being let into the deeper mystery of hearts like those of Douglas and Delia. To such the utterance of a beloved name in the presence of the uninitiated is an unpardonable profanation. But though that of Delia was not spoken, Arthur took care so to emphasize his account of the health of his uncle's family, as to convey to the mind of Douglas an assurance of all he wished to hear. But if Schwartz was not deep in the tender mysteries of refined and delicate love, no man better understood a hint, or better knew how to improve it. He accordingly interrupted the conversation, just to say that he brought important intelligence, which must be communicated that night; adding that he would leave them together for an hour. He now withdrew, and afforded the desired opportunity for unreserved conversation. “My Delia,” said Douglas; “I understand that she is well, and, I hope, happy.” “She is happy,” said Arthur. “She hears of you, from the impartial voice of public fame, in terms that fill her heart with pride, and leave no room there for alarm or melancholy. She feels as becomes a soldier's wife, anxious for her husband's fate, but confident in his fortunes. She has caught this notion from Mr. B—, who is her oracle, and who seems to have imparted to her, not only all his sentiments, but all the energy and buoyancy of his self-confident mind.” “Thank God!” said Douglas. “Just so would I have her to be. I knew it would be so. I saw her noble mother, when danger threatened my uncle; and I saw her too. But this is the first positive information, on that point, that has reached me since I have been here. Mr. B— and I can only correspond by messages through Schwartz, and though he is plain and accurate as a printed book in repeating what he understands, yet ideas of this sort are not in his line. And my good and venerable old father—are you here with his permission?” “I am not; nor does he know where I am. I have no doubt that I should have his approbation if he did. I am sure you have.” “I!” exclaimed Douglas, with a start of violent surprise. “What does he know of me.” “Nothing at all,” said Arthur, smiling. “But he knows of a certain partisan leader, whom the world calls Captain Douglas, and if I can read the old man's eyes, when he hears that name, he would rather call that man his son than any other on earth.” As Arthur spoke the eyes of Douglas filled, and, pressing his hand to his brow, he bowed his head a moment on the table. Then rising, he stood erect, and looking up with a rapt and abstracted air, his eye flashing through his tears, he folded his arms, and speaking in the measured tone of one who feels deeply, but in whose mind thought masters feeling, he parodied that noble speech which Shakspeare puts in the mouth of Prince Henry: “Then in the closing of some glorious day, “When I shall wear a garment all of blood, “And stain my favors with a bloody mask, “I will be bold to tell him, `I am your son.' ” “And my Delia!—my virgin bride! O! for that day, “When woman's pure kiss, sweet and long, “Welcomes her warrior home.” “I tell you, Arthur, that, in thoughts like these, there is a rapture which makes this hole in the rock a palace, and this flinty couch a bed of down. Are you prepared, my dear fellow, to partake with me in such feelings? That, I know, depends in part on Lucia. What of her?” “She is to me,” said Arthur, “all that Delia is to you; though she is too young to have the same strength of mind, and I have no right to expect the same confidence in my prowess and fortunes.” “Never fear. It will not be wanting at the pinch. A woman never fears for the safety of him she loves but when she doubts his truth. Let her feel that she is his second self, and self-confidence calms her fears. Let her feel that she lives in his heart, and, strong in love, she defies the dagger which assails it. Calphurnia trembled for Cæsar. Why? He was the husband of every woman in Rome. Had he been true to her, she would have felt only that prudent fear that he would not have derided. He would, perhaps, have yielded to her discreet remonstance, and her love would have justified the confidence which characterizes the love of woman, by saving his life. But, what a rhapsody I am uttering! You say my father does not know where you are? How is that?” “I was not at liberty to acquaint him with your secret. Your absence has drawn on him some displeasure from those in power, and their minions are all around him. It seems that you are supposed to be in the South for no good purpose, and not without an understanding with him. My disappearance will attract farther notice. For that he cares little; but he is so scrupulous in his notions of honor and truth, that, were he questioned about us, he could hardly conceal any thing he might know. Your letters, I see, still come from the South, though they say nothing of your whereabout. Of course, he thinks you are there; and I, without undeceiving him, simply asked leave to go to look for you. That his feelings are with us, I have no doubt. But he is so beset by spies, and so hampered by the position of our brothers in the army and navy, that he even tries to hide the secret of his thoughts from himself.” Thus the brothers conversed until Schwartz returned and claimed the Captain's ear; who began by asking what news he brought from B—. “The Colonel (so he always designated B—) likes your plan mightily, sir,” replied Schwartz, “if you can rub through with it. But he is afraid, from all he can learn, that them fellows at Lynchburg may be too many for you; so, he says, you must find out exactly how that is, and if you don't think it a pretty good chance, just slip down along the line, toward the middle of November, and join him.” “If I do so, where am I to find him precisely?” asked Douglas. “Just where the Petersburg railroad crosses the line,” said Schwartz. “You see the folks there are all friendly, because as long as things stay as they are, their railroad an't worth an old flint, and so they are patching up all the old cars, and fixing every thing for the Colonel, as soon as he can start a regiment or so, to make a dash at Petersburg, and so hold on there till the rest of his men join him. Now, if we were to be the first there, Captain, I have 8 † a notion that we'd be the very boys for them chaps at Petersburg.” “I should like that well,” said Douglas. “But I understand my old acquaintance, Col. Mason, at Lychburg, has a great desire to see me, and I should hate to disappoint him.” “I don't think he commands there now,” said Schwartz. “There is another regiment come from the North to join him, and they say the other is the oldest colonel.” “That is of course,” said Douglas, “for Mason is the youngest in the army. But I am not sorry for the exchange, for they have hardly sent as good a one. There is not a man among them I would not rather meet than Mason. Have you been able to learn the particulars of their force there?” “As well as I can understand,” replied Schwartz, “the whole number is not far from a thousand, and may be a few more.” “A thousand! Can we raise men enough to strike at them before they think of it?” “I have not a doubt of it, sir, if we could get at them on fair terms. The people along down between here and Staunton river don't like the thoughts of what them fellows may do to them, and they are keen to take them before they are ready. I talked to the head-men among them, as you told me, and they all see that the right way is to try to get the first blow. Because, you see, Captain, when we an't gaining we are losing. If we let the enemy hold Lynchburg, and they find two regiments will not do, they will bring four, and so on, till they get the upper hand, and then they will pay these poor fellows about here for old and new. But if we could make out to give them a real beating, and so drive them clean off, why all the country as far as the Rappahannock would rise that minute, and they'd have enough to do to hold their own at Fredericksburg.” “I suppose you said all this to Mr. B—?” “To be sure I did, sir; and he thinks just as we do about it, only he is dubious about attacking a fortified camp, as they call it, just with rifles.” “He is right about that,” replied Douglas. “Riflemen are the best troops in the world to defend a breast work, but they are the worst to attack one. I had hopes, however, that we might have drawn out the enemy by some device, even when Mason commanded. He is too brave to be ashamed to be prudent. I wish I knew whom they have sent to supersede him. But, whoever he is, it is a hundred to one, that being set over the head of an abler man, he will be impatient to show his superiority by reversing his predecessor's plans, and shaming the prudence of Mason by some hasty display of valor. If I did but know who was in command!” “I tried to find that out,” replied Schwartz; “because I knew you were pretty well acquainted with the most of them. You remember, sir, you told me from the first almost exactly how this Col. Mason was going to do. But I could not find any body that could tell me the new Colonel's name. But, whoever he is, Mr. B— thinks, and so do I, (but that is nothing,) and I have a notion you do too partly, sir, that if we mean to do any thing with them, we must try to catch them somewhere between here and Lynchburg.” “I am afraid that is all too true,” said Douglas, “and if no such chance offers, we shall have to give them the slip as B— proposes; and I should hate it.” “And so would I,” said Schwartz; “and so, you see, sir, I have been trying to fix a sort of a plan to draw them out, and that is what I want to tell you about.” What this plan was, the next chapter shall disclose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXII. And yet I knew him a notorious liar; Think him a great-way fool—solely a coward. Shakspeare “You must understand, Captain,” continued Schwartz, “that I had allotted to fall in with your brother about Little Roanoke bridge, where our roads come together. The people there are friendly, and mighty clever people, and if they don't know all about me, they don't want much of it; for they are our own sort of folks, and true as steel. So I thought I could depend on them to take notice for me when such a man might pass, and let me know. When I got there, by all I could learn, your brother had not gone by; and, as I was pretty tired, and that is one of the places where I commonly lie by to pick up news, I thought I would stop a while. “I had not been there long, before here comes the Captain that commands the company at Farmville; and, if ever I saw a conceited fool, you may be sure he is one. What he was after, the Lord knows. He said he was a reconnoitering, but I have 8 † a notion he was just looking for some body to talk to; and as the folks there an't got much chat for any body, he just claps to talking to me. And he run on about one thing and another, and there was nothing I wanted to know but what he told me, only just I knew it all before. But I thought, may be, I might get something out of him, so I let him talk, and I sot and listened. “After a while he gets to talking about you. And, Lord! how he wished you would come in his way; and how he would have served you, if you had tried to beat up his quarters, like you did them fellows at Lynchburg. But he was in hopes to have a clip at you yet, only just you were always hiding and skulking in the mountains, like a wolf, and then coming down in the night to kill sheep. And he reckoned you knew where the dogs was, and took care to keep out of their way. And then he laughed, and thought he was mighty smart. So, thinks I, `stranger, if you have a mind to get into hot water, may be you may have a chance.' So I speaks up; and, says I, `after all, that Captain Douglas an't half the man he's cracked up for, no how.' ” “Do you know him?” says he. “I guess I do,” says I; “he is cunning enough, and he has got tricks enough, and signs and countersigns to keep out of harm's way; but,” says I, “if a man could just get hold of his signs, and so get at him, he an't nothing for a right, real, hard fight.” “They tell me,” says he, “there an't no such thing as getting in twenty miles of him, or more, may be; and all the folks through the country there stands guard for him, and nobody else knows where he is.” “That's very true,” says I; “but then, you see, stranger, when too many folks has got a secret, then it an't a secret no more.” “It's a wonder,” says he, “some of them don't tell.” “May be they cannot get any thing by telling,” says I. “There's many a poor fellow there, to my knowing, that don't see a dollar once a year, and its mighty little the sight of a few yellow jackets would not make them tell, only just they never seed any, and don't know what they are. But they'd be right apt to find out.” “You talk like you know that part of the country,” says he. “May be you know something about it.” “May be I might,” says I. “But then,” says I, “it don't become a poor fellow, like me, to know any thing that a grand officer, with his fine apperlets, all of solid gold, don't know. Lord!” says I, “if I had but half the money you give for your apperlets, I reckon I'd know something then.” And with that, he looks right hard at me, and says he, “may be you'd like to list for a soldier.” “May be I would,” says I, “if they pays me well. 'Cause, you see,” says I, “sir, as to the country and the President, and all that, its what I don't know nothing about; only I takes their part as takes my part. And that's the reason,” says I, “I would not stay up yonder.” “Why,” says he, “do you live there, when you are at home?” “I cannot say,” says I, “that I have got a home rightly any where. But I did live there, after a fashion; and they wanted me to do like the rest of them, and quit my business and keep guard, and stop every man that could not give the signs. And what was I to get by it? Just nothing at all. If I had any bread of my own to eat, why, I might eat it; and if I killed a deer, they'd take their share, and thought they did great things if they let me keep the skin; but as to pay, they don't think of such a thing. But that would not do for me,” says I; “and, more than that, it won't do for more, besides me, whatever Captain Douglas may think of it, I can tell him.” “Well,” says he, “if you'll list with me you shall have pay, and bounty, and clothes, and rations, and all. 'Cause,” says he, “the President, he keeps the key of the treasury, and we are his soldiers, and we all live like fighting cocks, I can tell you.” “Well,” says I, “I'd like to list well enough, only just I guess if once you had me for a soldier, you'd make me tell all I know, and ax me no odds; and,” says I, “I have been a-thinking, if I could meet with any right clever gentleman, that would pay me for telling, I'd tell it all first, and then list afterwards. “Well,” says he, “do you know Douglas's signs, enough to carry a man to his camp as a friend?” “I guess I do,” says I, “and more than that, too.” “And what do you know,” says he. “That's telling,” says I. “But,” says he, “I want to know all about it,” says he, “because Col. Mason, there, at Lynchburg, is determined to break Douglas up, if he can get at him; and he is looking every day for more men from the North to help him.” “Well,” says I, “I can put him in a way to get at him, and not go up there into the mountains, neither. 'Cause,” says I, “that's an ugly place. It an't one regiment, nor two neither hardly, that could do much there. And then, again, if Douglas was to find too many coming against him, he'd be away t'other side of Salem before they'd get there.” “And how is a body to get at him?” says he. “Ah!” says I, “that's a long story.” “Well,” says he, “I see what you are after, and if you'll put me in a way to give Col. Mason a fair clip at him, it will make my fortune, and then I'll be bound to see you paid handsomely.” “That an't what I am after,” says I. “Why, don't you want money?” says he. “To be sure I do,” says I; “but that an't money.” “Well,” says he, “tell me what you can do, and I will tell you what I'll do.” “That's something like,” says I. “As to what I can do, I can put you in a way to catch Captain Douglas out of the mountains, with as many men as you please to bring agin him.” “Well,” says he, “if you'll do that, I'll pay you a hundred dollars.” “The dear Lord!” says I. “A hundred dollars! I never expected to have that much money in my life!” “May be it's too much,” says he. “May be fifty will do?” “No, no,” says I; “a hundred will do mighty well; so let me have the cash, and I'll tell you all.” “That won't do,” says he. “How do I know that what you are going to tell me will do me any good?” “Well,” says I, “I reckon if one won't another will.” So, with that, he studied a while, and says he: “Well, I'll give you my note for a hundred dollars, to be paid directly after Col. Mason gets a lick at Douglas in the low country, by my help.” “Cannot you give me an order on Mr. Morton, here, in the same way?” says I. “You are mighty tight,” says he; “but may be I can.” So, with that he speaks to Mr. Morton, and he agreed to accept the order. You see, sir, Mr. Morton, as I told you, is a true-hearted Virginian; and he knows me, and I just sorter winked at him, to let him know all was safe. For as to that fellow paying him again, after he paid me, Mr. Morton had'nt no thought of it, nor I neither. But he seed what I was after, and says he to the Captain: “To be sure, sir, its nothing I would not do to serve the country.” And with that they fixed the order all right, and gives it to me, and I slips it back again into Mr. Morton's hand. And then I takes the Captain out again, and tells him the way up here; and, says I, “Now, if you can get to see Captain Douglas, you must fix a good story to tell him.” “And what must that be?” says he. “Why, you have only just to tell him that you have raised a parcel of men in Bedford county, or somewhere thereaway, sorter toward Lynchburg, and you want to know where to join him. Then he'll be sure to tell you when he is coming down out of the mountains, and he'll name a place for you to meet him at, and then if you don't fix him about right, it an't my fault.” “But how am I to get to him?” says he. “That's it,” says I, “and that's what you never could do without help. You see,” says I, “sir, every man in that country lives by hunting, more or less; and every man has a rifle for himself, and one for every one of his boys, and may be more. And when a fellow is going any where, he never knows when he may see a deer; so you never can catch them without their rifles. But then you may travel all through the country, and you won't see a man that looks any ways like a soldier. And when they want to stop a man, they don't bawl at him and ask for the countersign. That sort of thing may do in an army, but it won't do with folks that have not got an army to back them. So you may fall in with ever so many of them, and they'll find you out; but if they choose to let you pass, you'll never find them out, nor know what they are after.” “But how are they to find me out,” says he, “if they an't got no countersign?” “They an't got no countersign, rightly,” says I; “but it is pretty much the same thing, if a man asks you a civil question, and you don't know what answer to give him. Now, suppose you was travelling along there, and you meets one of them fellows, and he was to ask you, mighty innocent like, what parts you were from. What would you say? “I don't know,” says he. “May be I'd tell him I was from down about Halifax court-house.” “And that minute,” says I, “he'd know all about you.” “How's that,” says he. “Why, that 's the way they ax for the countersign,” says I. “What is the countersign?” says he. “Currituck,” says I; “when they ax you that, you must say you come from Currituck.” “And is that all?” says he. “Why, that is a countersign, sure enough. But don't they never change it? “No,” says I; “the men are too much scattered all through the country, for that; but it answers mighty well, the way they fix it. They don't let you off with one question, just so, but they'll ask you a heap more; and they'll say a heap of simple things to you, just to hear what you'll say; and just about the time you think you have fooled them, they'll find you out. There's a parcel of sharp fellows up thereaway, mind, I tell you; and you'll have to get your lesson mighty well before you go there. You see, some will ask you one question and some another. You don't know what its going to be; so I must tell you all the straight of it, and you must practise before we part; and then,” says I, “you can write it all down, and all the way you go you can be saying it over.” So, with that, sir, I tells him the biggest part of our questions; but you may be sure I give him wrong answers to every one of 9 † them. But then I told our people at the different stations along about him, and told them to pass him, and never let him know but what his answers were all right. So then I tells him that when he got to you, you would want to know, may be, how he came by the signs; and, says I, “when he axes you that, you must tell him you got them from Job Dixon,” says I. “That's a fellow the Captain keeps busy recruiting away down the country, and when he hears that, he wont suspicion you the least in the world; 'cause you see,” says I, “the man they call Job Dixon has got another name besides that, and that name an't nothing but a sort of a countersign for the Captain to know the men by that he sends in.” You see, Captain, I fixed all this way, that I might let you know exactly, so that if the fellow should come when I was out of the way, you might know what to think of him, just as if I was here. And it won't do to let him see me, no how.” “Job Dixon!” said Douglas. “Well, let me make a memorandum of that name.” Saying this, he took a letter from his pocket, and endorsing the name of Job Dixon on the back of it, as that of the writer, threw it on the table. “That will do,” said Schwartz. “He will be here bright and early in the morning, and when he sees that, he will feel as safe as a rat in a mill.” “Here in the morning!” said Douglas. “How can you be sure of that?” “I seed him from the top of the mountain,” replied Schwartz, “when Witt stopped him. I told Witt to keep him all night, and send him on in the morning, with a couple of fellows to show him the way, and guard him.” “If that is the case,” said Douglas, “I can meet him at the piquet, and stop him there; for I would rather he should not see this place. But what arrangement would you advise me to make with him?” “Why, the Colonel says,” replied Schwartz, “that he wants you to join him at his rendezvous about the last of November, or may be a little earlier; so whatever you do ought to be done time enough to fall back, if we get worsted, and slip along down the line, according to your old plan. So I am a thinking it would be well to fix the time for meeting this fellow about the tenth of the month, and then, if we can catch them in their own trap, we shall have time to follow up the blow and break up their whole establishment there at Lynchburg, and then march boldly down the straight road.” “Do you know of any crossing place on Staunton river, in the direction of Lynchburg,” asked Douglas, “that would answer for an ambuscade?” “I have a notion,” said Schwartz, “that Jones's Ford would suit as well as any other; because there's a deep hollow comes down on both sides of it, and thick woods on the hills.” “That will do then,” said Douglas. “So now let us take our supper and go to rest; for I must be at the picket in time to meet your man. Before you go to sleep, suppose you send one of our boys to tell them to stop him if he gets there before me.” The supper was produced, and fully justified what Witt had told Arthur of the fare he might expect. As to lodging, bear-skins were plenty, and so were blankets, which had been collected during the expedition against Lynchburg. But a rock is a hard bed, put on it what you will. Yet youth, and health, and high excitement, gave Arthur a most luxurious supper, and a night of such sleep as the best lodged prince in Europe might envy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIII. The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep. When Arthur awoke, he found himself alone. The sun was high in the heavens, but a deep shadow hung over the dark glen, into which his rays never looked, except at noon-day. Arthur now walked out, and amused himself with gazing around on the singular spot which his brother had chosen as a place of refuge. It was, indeed, a place of strength, which seemed calculated to bid defiance to any thing but famine. The glen, at this point, might be some two hundred feet deep. Above and below, the little stream filled the whole chasm, pouring furiously along between overhanging cliffs. The tops of these, except in the immediate vicinity, were crowned with lofty trees, which, nodding to each other across the gulph, in some places nearly intermingled their branches. The valley, just where Douglas had pitched his camp, was somewhat wider. Just above, the stream seemed to gush from the very bowels of the mountain, dashing, as it tumbled over a fall of twenty or thirty feet, against the dark evergreens which clustered both sides of the gulph. From thence, flowing through 9 † a wider space, it still confined itself to a narrow and deep channel, scooped into an almost cavernous bed, under the western cliff. Thence, turning abruptly to the southeast, it swept across the dell to the opposite hill, from which it again recoiled in like manner. There was thus, on each side, between the hill and the receding stream, a spot of dry ground, or rather rock. It was indeed nothing but a rocky shelf, a little above inundation, jutting in a half moon from the base of the cliff. About the middle of its passage from hill to hill, the stream tumbled over a ledge, the highest points of which, rising above the water, served as stepping stones, and afforded a passage across, practicable indeed, but neither commodious, nor, to the eye of a stranger, even safe. The sort of stair which afforded the only approach to this savage den, hung directly over the stream, at the point where, having crossed from the western side of the glen, it again whirled back, leaving, as I have said, a dry spot on its eastern margin. At the upper corner of this shelf, where it touched the cliff, the path reached the bottom; and an hundred yards below, at the lower extremity of the same platform, hung the tent-cloth that indicated the quarters of the chief. The sort of cave, the mouth of which was concealed by this, was but a deepening of the recess under the cliff, which every where afforded a partial shelter from the weather, and a complete defence against rocks tumbled from above. Under this were the rude beds and camp-fires of the men, and in front of them a breast-work of logs, raised high enough to afford protection from any shot fired from the opposite hill. Between the upper log and that next below it, was a sort of loop-hole, made by cutting corresponding notches in each; and as the edges of the cliffs had been shorn of all their growth, a man could not show himself on either, without being exposed to the fatal fire of men directing their aim with a rest; and in all the coolness of perfect safety. The most curious part of the whole establishment was a sort of mill. At the point where the stream, breaking over the rocky ledge of which I have spoken, swept away around the shoulder of the platform, was placed a small log pen. The end of a shaft, projecting from it, overhung the water. Into this were driven stakes, fitted at one end into large auger-holes, and, at the other, spread out like a broad oar. These fan-like extremities dipped in the water, and, yielding to its force, kept the shaft revolving night and day. Machinery equally rude connected its movements with those of a pair of light mill-stones, which found no rest, and required no attention. Though grinding less than a bushel in the hour, it still ground on and on, affording coarse bread for the whole company, and showing how true the old adage, that “fair and softly go far in a day.” One man was seen to replenish the hopper. Others were passing and repassing, each with his share of meal. The whole was covered with rude boards. Exposed to the fire of each cliff, it was, of course, capable of being made to command both, and some of its features showed that it was intended to be occupied as a tower of strength in case of attack. In short, to the unpracticed eye of Arthur, the whole presented the appearance of impregnable security and well arranged preparation. There was indeed no present danger, but the place had been chosen and fitted with a view to the last extremity. The course of the stream, tending to the South, led in a few miles into the State of North Carolina, and in that direction there was an outlet practicable, though difficult. Between the camp and the State line there was no point at which the glen could be entered; and Douglas, if driven to retreat in that direction, had none but natural obstacles to overcome. Cold weather was now approaching, and there was no station where the troops of Douglas were so little exposed to the severity of the season as this. The soft air from the waterfall, though never warm, was never intensely cold, and no other wind but that from the south ever entered the glen. Hence as many men as were not engaged on active duty were assembled here. Still the number present was but small. Some were at the piquet, some on the scout. Besides, it was now the hunting season, and many were abroad in the woods, as the carcasses brought in during the course of the morning plainly showed. Arthur now looked around for Schwartz; and hearing his voice behind one of the breast-works, passed around the end of it, and silently joining the circle, listened to his discourse, which seemed to be a sort of military lecture. “You see, boys,” said he, “as to tictacs, or whatever they call it, that sort of thing an't made for the like of us. When a parcel of fellows lists for soldiers, just because they an't got nothing else to do, and may be one half of them is cowards, and the other half not much better, they are obliged to have rules to go by. Because, if once you can beat it into a fellow's head that after he has got into danger it is safer for him to stand still than to run away, why then the worse scared he is the surer he will be to stay there. But it an't so with us, because if any of us was any way scary, he would not be here no how. The only rule for us is the Indian rule. “In the first place, it is our business always to know where the inimy is before he knows where we are, and then, if we dont want to fight him, keep out of his way. Now the right way to do that, is just to squander, like a flock of partridges. “Then if you are going to fight, the only rule is to give the word, and let every man kill all he can, and take care of himself the best he can. Now that way the riglars fight; if one man in ten kills a man, they call it desperate bloody work. But I reckon if there was an inimy now coming up the valley to the foot of the Devil's Back-bone, and the word was to kill all we could before he got there, any of us here would feel mighty cheap if he did not kill somebody. “And mind, boys, whether we fight or run, whether we keep together, or squander, `two and two,' is the word. You must all mate yourselves two and two, to stand together and run together, to fight together and die together. One of you must call himself number one, and the other number two, and then, if there's a hundred together and the inimy comes, number two never fires till number one has fired and loaded again. You see, men, a fellow takes good aim, when he knows there's another one by, to hit if he misses; and fifty rifles in that way, will do more than a hundred when every one knows that's his last chance. Fifty rifles will stop a troop of horse, and a hundred cannot do no more. But if the guns are all empty, then here comes what's left of them slashing away with the broad-swords like devils. But let there be a few more guns to pepper away at them while the first are loading, and they will go to the right-about mighty quick. “Now mind what I tell you, boys, and the first time it comes to the pinch, you'll say old Schwartz did'nt fight Indians so long for nothing. And as to running, any man that's afraid to run when he sees cause, is half a coward, any how. Do you run just when you please. I God! I'd hate to depend on a man to fight that I could not trust to run. There is no harm in running, if you know where you are running to, and your friends know it too; and the right way is to fix a place, every morning, to meet at night, and let every man get there as he can, and do what mischief he can. But, mind, if it comes to that, always run two and two, and then one can help another; and if one comes up missing, the other can tell what's become of him. “I'm telling our boys,” continued Schwartz, who now observed Arthur, “some of the lessons I learned among the Shawnees. You see, Mr. Arthur, (you must not think strange of my calling you so, sir, for all your family seem like my own flesh and blood to me—for all you don't know how that is;) you see, sir, the Captain is a regular officer, built plum from the ground up; but for all that, he knows that all this is true; and, before now, when he and I have been setting over the fire, at night, he has told me about one Gineral Braddock, I think they called him, that got his men shot all to pieces, and himself too, just because he would not believe that there was any other way to fight but just his way. Now, you see, sir, the reason why he was taken at an onplush was, that he was fighting agin Indians. Well, suppose we fight Indian-fashion; will not that be pretty much the same thing? May be we an't exactly up to that, but we must do the best we can; for as to fighting the riglars just in their own way, why they'll beat us as long as the sun shines. “Do you mind that night,” continued Schwartz, laughing, “when the Lieutenant and his men came there to your uncle's to take him and the Captain? That was Indian play for you. I God! if I had not heard that the Colonel was there, I should have knowed he was at the fixing of that business. You see, sir, that is what a man learns by living in places where a body is never safe; and the upshot of it is, that after a while he gets so that he never can be in any danger. It's like learning to sleep with one eye always open.” Schwartz now rose from the ground, where he had been sitting, and brushing the ashes from his leathers, joined Arthur, and they repaired to the tent where their simple meal awaited them. From him the youth learned that his brother had repaired to the piquet at an early hour; and to the piquet, gentle reader, we will now follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIV. —He has merit; Sufficient for itself its own reward. Why think of him! An honorable fool, He seeks no other guerdon. Anonymous. Douglas was at the piquet long enough before the arrival of his guest, to make such arrangements as should prevent the stranger from suspecting that this was not the camp he was desirous to see. He had no mind that his enemy should know the real nature and precise position of his main strong-hold. Hence he had determined to give him the meeting at the piquet, and took pains to provide, as if for his own ordinary accommodation, such a breakfast as he would have been content to furnish at his own quarters for the most honored visiter. The spy, who had learned little of his profession but that self-indulgent art which is technically called “playing old soldier,” had been in no haste to leave his rest, and Witt, who understood Schwartz's game, did not hurry him. The breakfast hour, therefore, had fully arrived before he made his appearance. He came accompanied by Witt and 10 † another of his party; and, in appearance and manners, fully answered the description of him given by Schwartz. He was a tall, red-haired man, vain, pert, and full of self-complacency. Indeed, so much did he display of a satisfaction, at once chuckling and childish, that Douglas, even though unwarned, must have suspected treachery. Besides, he never could have believed a being, manifestly so frivolous and foolish, capable of the high purpose of devoting himself to a life of toil, hardship, and danger. The vain and self-indulgent may receive momentary impulses, under the influence of which brilliant achievements may be suddenly accomplished; but from such the tasks of study, virtue, and enduring courage, must never be expected. He seemed, at first, more intent upon his breakfast than any thing else, and when it appeared, made faces at his coarse fare which ill accorded with his professed indifference to all personal inconvenience. But, bad as it was, he contrived to swallow enough to show that he was not prepared to play the ascetic any more in regard to the quantity than the quality of his food. “You see,” said Douglas, “the life we lead. If you are not prepared to submit cheerfully to privations, compared to which what you see here is luxury, you should not join us.” “Damn luxury,” said the other. “What do I care about luxury? To be sure, I have been used to it all my life; coffee or tea, one, every morning for breakfast, and good light bread, and potatoes, and pies; and then, for dinner, pork or fresh meat, or codfish, at least every day in the week, and all sorts of sass, and then pies again, and cheese, and all that. But I am ready to give it all up to serve my country, and live as hard as any body.” “I am glad to hear it,” said Douglas, drawing some papers from his pocket. Among these he affected to search in vain for a particular paper, and in doing so, carelessly threw on the table the letter endorsed with the name Job Dixon. He saw that it caught the other's eyes, and, expressing some dissatisfaction at his own carelessness, said: “You have a right to know, before you join us, all about our force, and I ought to show you my last return; but I have it not at hand, though I believe I know pretty well the number of my men. But stay,” continued he, interrupting himself with a start, and looking at the gallant Captain with a keenness that made his very back ache, “How came you by my pass-words, sir?” “I got them from a man they call Job Dixon,” replied the trembling Captain. “Job Dixon!” replied Douglas, immediately resuming his complacency; “then all is right.” “O yes! all is right,” said the other, recovering from his alarm, but more fluttered and confused than ever. “He told me that wa'nt his name, sure enough, and he said that name was only a sort of a countersign to you.” It cost Douglas some effort to suppress a smile at seeing the delicate and dangerous office of a spy undertaken by one so destitute of all the qualities necessary to it; but he commanded himself, and asked whether the other was now content to join him. “To be sure I am,” said he; “and not only I, but fifty more as good fellows as ever stepped shoe-leather. You see, that was what I doubted about. I thought may be as I had such a company, I had a right to set up for myself; but after I heard all about you from that man, Job Dixon, or whatever else his name is, I made up my mind to join you.” “Where are your men?” asked Douglas. “They are all about home yet,” said the Captain, “but I can bring them together any day, and any place you please to name. I suppose you don't mean to stay up here in the mountains all the time, and may be it might suit as well for me to fall in with you somewhere.” “That is true,” said Douglas. “We are not so well off here for rations, as to want any body before we have use for them. As long as we stay here we are strong enough. A regiment of men could not climb the Devil's Back-bone before our faces. But I propose to move shortly, and should be glad of a reinforcement on the way. What county are your men in?” “In Bedford county,” replied the other, repeating his lesson exactly. “That will do, then,” said Douglas. “I propose to march against Mason, at Lynchburg, early in November, and on the fifth day of the month I will meet you at Jones's Ford, on Staunton river.” “I cannot say that I know exactly where that is,” said the spy. “It is little out of your way into any part of Bedford county,” said Douglas; “and as I want to see some of our friends down in that quarter, I will ride there with you. I am told Mason is pretty strong, and I want to get all the force I can, and that is not so much but what I shall be glad of your help.” “How many men have you?” asked the Yankee Captain. “I have but a handful here, just now; but I am sending out orders for more to join on the route, and I am in hopes to reach the river with four hundred at least. I shall stay there, at all events, till more come in; because it would be foolish to attack Mason's regiment with less than five or six hundred.” “That will do,” said the other; “for Mason is not more than four hundred strong.” “Indeed!” replied Douglas, affecting surprise and pleasure. “Then I am pretty sure of him. I had heard as much before, but I don't trust every 10 † body. I was afraid there was a trap set for me; but now I am satisfied, and if I can leave Staunton river with six hundred men, I shall gather force enough before I get to Lynchburg to drive Mason and his regiment before me like chaff.” Having said this, Douglas set about the necessary arrangements for accompanying his new acquaintance to Jones's Ford. As the distance was too great for one day, he proposed to pass the night at the house of a trusty friend, from whence the Yankee officer would have it in his power to reach a tavern, two miles beyond the river, the next day. He now despatched a note to Arthur, saying that he wished to examine the ground at the river, in company with him and Schwartz. He therefore directed them to follow at a cautious distance, so as not to be seen by the spy; to pass them in the night, and take up their quarters at a house in advance, and the next day proceed to the dwelling of Mr. Gordon, (a staunch friend,) near the river, and wait for him there. Meantime a horse, that stood piqueted hard by, was saddled, and Douglas set out, accompanied by the treacherous Captain and the faithful Witt. The journey was made without any occurrence worth noting. In the conversation of the stranger there was nothing to beguile Douglas from his own thoughts. The vain babble of the prating coxcomb was all wasted on the impenetrable Witt; and, after a few fruitless attempts to overcome the taciturnity of his companions, he followed their example, and the greater part of the journey was made in silence. Late on the second evening they reached the river. The spy was directed to the public house on the other side, and Douglas and Witt returned to Mr. Gordon's, where they found Arthur and Schwartz. As they were now in a land of civilization and comfort, Douglas was not sorry to obtain, once more, a good night's lodging, which his hospitable friend was delighted to afford. But this rare enjoyment did not make him forgetful of the necessity of watching the motions of his enemy. He accordingly despatched a scout to the house to which the Yankee had been directed, to make sure that he had gone on. At a late hour the man returned, and roused Douglas to inform him that the spy had indeed gone as far as he had intended, and that he had there fallen in with a party of a dozen dragoons, commanded by a subaltern, who were on a scout through the country. With this officer he had been seen to be engaged in private and earnest conversation, and orders had been issued to the men to look well to the condition of their arms, and to be in readiness to move at day-light. It at once occurred to Douglas that a new scheme had entered the head of the vain and frivolous being who had thrust himself into an affair requiring qualities so different. It was probable that he wished to avail himself of the presence of this little party to endeavor to surprise his enemy, whom he had reason to believe to be still near the Ford. The folly of risking the defeat of his favorite enterprise by joining in the attempt, and thus throwing off his mask, was not likely to occur to him. The question with Douglas was, whether by abiding the attack he should afford the bungling fool, whom he had been leading into his own trap, a chance to escape from it by his own blunder. In this apprehension, however, he did not give that worthy due credit for his discretion. He had indeed considered Douglas as his proper prey; and though he had been unable to restrain his disposition to babble, he sorely repented his indiscretion, when he found the other officer disposed to anticipate him. He had accordingly earnestly dissuaded him from attempting any thing; and, not prevailing in this, had determined to go on alone, and leave the other to execute his project as he might. But though uncertain what might be the conduct of the spy, Douglas could not resist his inclination to throw himself in the way of the expected attack. It was necessary that he should examine the ground carefully, and he had not time to wait until the scouting party should have left the neighborhood. Besides, he was anxious to inform himself precisely of the force and position of the enemy, and the name of their new commander. For this purpose he was eager to make at least one prisoner. And, after all, perhaps not the least moving consideration, was his desire to taste once more the stormy joy of battle. Upon the whole, he determined to turn the tables on his enemy, if possible; and, instead of returning to bed, prepared immediately for action. All things were soon ready. The master of the house, his two sons, and three of the neighbors, who, hearing that he was there, had called to see him, added to his own party, made a force of ten men, with which he was not afraid to abide the attack of thirteen. At the head of these he took the road, and by daylight had occupied the ground where he wished to meet the enemy. At the point of which we speak, the road, after passing for some miles over a broad and level ridge, at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the river, dives suddenly into a steep defile between two hills. The descent is rapid, and, in less than a hundred yards, the hills come down abruptly on either hand, leaving between them barely space enough for the road, which is quite narrow. They are steep, rugged, with projecting rocks, and altogether impracticable to cavalry; and are moreover covered with a heavy growth of timber and brushwood. At the distance of about two hundred yards from the plain above, the road turns sharp to the right. It then pursues a course nearly direct, for a like distance; and then, turning short to the left, the river, ford, and the opposite landing, are at once in full view. A point a little below the first mentioned bend was selected by Douglas for his position. He posted Witt and three others on one side of the road, behind rocks and trees, while he, Arthur, and one more, disposed themselves, in like manner, on the other. Schwartz, with the rest, passed through the defile, with orders to hide themselves near the bank, and let the enemy pass without interruption. A pole had been thrown across the road, some twenty yards in front of Douglas and his party. The crossing of this, by the enemy, was to be the signal for firing. The officer was designated to be the mark of Witt. The right and left hand man of the leading file, had each his appropriate executioner appointed; then the two next, and then two more, were in like manner foredoomed, so that no shot should be thrown away. While these arrangements were making, Arthur bethought him of Schwartz's lecture on tactics, and was at once sensible of the vast superiority of untaught courage and sagacity, on occasions like this, over the sort of discipline on which the martinet is so apt to pride himself. About sunrise, the enemy appeared, consisting, as the scout had said, of a dozen men, under the command of a single officer. To the great relief of Douglas, the redoubtable Yankee Captain was not with them. As the hill was steep, they advanced in a walk, while the officer, who was in the rear, occasionally turned his horse's head to the hill, seeming to examine for some recess in which his party might draw aside, and form a sort of ambuscade. But there was no such spot. The ground was every where too steep for cavalry; and, disappointed, he put spurs to his horse, and pushed forward to resume his place at the head of the party. They were now near the fatal point; every rifle was in rest, and duly levelled at its mark, and in the moment that the leading file were crossing the pole, six saddles were emptied, and six horses ran masterless. The aim of Witt at the officer, who was much more distant, and moving rapidly, was less fatal. But his ball took effect, as was plainly shown by the sword arm, which, at the moment, fell powerless. The men went to the right about in a moment, and a shout, which the echoes of the steep gorge multiplied into a hundred voices, sent them down the hill at full speed. The officer, though wounded, was not quite so ready to take to his heels, and called to his men to halt. With all but one, he succeeded; but that one, wild with terror, dashed on. In the mean time, Schwartz and his little party had planted themselves in the road, near the river, and their array was the first object that met the eye of the affrighted soldier as he turned the angle of the road. But panic is as apt to hurry a man into danger as away from it, and the sight of this new enemy only urged the poor wretch to a more desperate effort to escape, by breaking by them. In vain did the men throw up their arms, and call to him to stop. He rushed on, right upon Schwartz, who stood in the middle of the road, and who, as a dernier resort, stopped his career with a bullet. The report of his rifle, and a glimpse of Douglas's men advancing along the side of the hill to get within shot, decided the officer that it was time to look to his safety. Turning the angle of the road, he saw the fate of his fallen soldier, and the cause of it. Immediately calling on his men to follow, he dashed on with an impetuosity which showed a determination to force a passage or perish. The result was inevitable. Schwartz was in the act of loading his rifle. The other three leveled theirs. They had not been trained in Schwartz's school of tactics, and all three, attracted by the epaulette and plume and sash of the officer, fired at him. He fell dead, and the rest, perceiving their advantage, rushed on the mountaneers, who, of necessity, sprang aside, and let them pass. One of them was not so nimble, but that, as he clambered up the rocky face of the hill, a sweeping back-handed stroke inflicted a deep gash in the back part of his thigh. This was the only injury received by the party of Douglas in the affair, and dearly did it cost the man who gave it. Schwartz marked him, and coolly went on loading his rifle. By the time he had effected this, the soldier was half way across the river, and, the next moment, tumbled from his horse, and went floating down the stream. The other five gained the shore before another rifle could be loaded, and, doubling a rocky point around which the road turned, disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11 † CHAPTER XXXV. This victory, though on a small scale, was complete in itself. It was a favorable omen, too, and might serve as a sort of rehearsal of the more important battle to be fought on the same ground. In one thing only Douglas had been disappointed, by the eagerness of Schwartz's men. He had made no prisoners, and the fallen enemy were all either dead, or not in condition to be harassed by such questions as he wished to ask. They were necessarily committed to the care of such of the party as lived in the neighborhood; and their horses and arms being secured, were placed in the same hands for safe keeping. The feelings of Arthur, as he looked on this fearful scene of slaughter, were such as might be expected to possess the mind of a youth, who, as yet, had never seen the blood of man shed in strife. But these are nothing to the purpose of my tale. It is enough to say, that the contemplation of it wrought the usual change in his character. He now felt that to kill or be killed was the order of the day; and, though his next sleep was haunted by visions of the ghastly objects that lay before him, he awoke from it with a mind prepared for the stern duties of war. Requesting the company and advice of his host, Douglas now proceeded to examine the ground. He found the river hills every where intersected, on both sides of the river, by ravines such as that I have described. The ford was shallow, but just above was deep water, which, on the north side, came down quite near to the gravel bar, which served as a dam. Here a steep and high rock bounded the river, and along the base of it, the water eddied in a deep pool, and then swept away in a stong, but shallow current. At a short distance below was the mouth of a ravine, overgrown with lofty trees, and clustering with brushwood, at a distance of fifty yards from the landing-place. The road, issuing from the river at the foot of the rock, holds a straight course for twenty yards, or thereabouts, and then turning short to the left, is no more in sight of the river. From thence a short, but steep ascent through a deep cleft in the hills, brings the traveller to the top, where he turns again to the right, and resumes the direction towards Lynchburg. After a thorough examination of the whole, the party returned to breakfast at the house of Mr. Gordon. Douglas rode slowly and thoughtfully. At length he said apart to Schwartz: “Your plot is admirable; but I am afraid it will fail.” “What chance of that?” asked Schwartz. “They will be ashamed to bring more than a thousand men against you, even if they had them. We can raise as many as they can, and we shall be on the ground, and have the same advantage we had just now.” “But suppose they come and take possession first;” said Douglas. “Oh! no danger of that. They'll be in no hurry to leave their snug quarters any sooner than they can help; and we can be here a day or two before the time.” “It may be so,” said Douglas; “but I don't think Col. Mason takes me for an absolute fool; and if he does, he has reason to know that I have sharp-witted men about me. But any man's wits may fail him sometimes. For example, it has never occurred to either of us, that Mason will certainly not believe that we have been fooled by such a fellow as this Yankee of yours. Will he not, therefore, at once suspect the truth, and conclude that we are trying to catch him in his own trap?” “I God!” said Schwartz, “that is true. I had not thought of that. The fellow is too silly to be made bait of, sure enough. But then, you see, Captain, we can fix them any how. Mr. Gordon here can raise men enough, in three days, to keep them from crossing the river, until we are ready for them; and then, you know, we can push across a part of our men, and toll them over. If once we get them into a right sharp fight, they 'll follow us across the river fast enough.” “I have no doubt of their coming to look for us,” said Douglas; “and no doubt of a fight; but we must be prepared to meet more men than we have bargained for. Depend upon it, they will bring every man they can raise. Why, would you believe it, the fellow talked to me about living at home on codfish, and potatoes, and cider, and pies, and all sorts of sass? Such a simpleton could not impose on a child. Col. Mason has talents worthy of a better cause, and he will see through the whole affair. I suppose he is superseded; but he is an honorable man, and will frankly give the benefit of his suspicions to his superior, who can hardly be such a fool as to disregard his suggestions. We must bestir ourselves, therefore, or give up the game and escape from our own plot. “Gentlemen,” continued Douglas, speaking aloud, and in a sustained and decisive tone, “this is our place of rendezvous; the time mid-day on the third of November. Every man must come prepared for action, and such as mean to accompany me to the lower country, must bring with them all their necessaries. Mr. Gordon, I must depend on you to hold this pass, and keep the enemy from crossing the river. I shall send a force to support you, if necessary. You, Schwartz, know what to do better than I can tell you. You, Witt, will return with me, and 11 † we will talk, as we ride, of what is to be done. Mr. Gordon, we could travel without food, but our horses cannot. We must trouble you for something for all, and then we part until the day of rendezvous. Until that time, `Vigilance and Activity' is the word; but then, `Freedom, Independence, and Glory.”' As Douglas said this they arrived at Mr. Gordon's door. The ready meal was hastily swallowed, the horses fed, and they departed for the camp. On the way Schwartz, turning to the left, kept a southward course through the district, along the foot of the mountains, to rouse the inhabitants in that quarter, and to collect a party to support Mr. Gordon. The rest returned to the camp, from whence runners were despatched throughout all the adjacent country, and even beyond the mountain to the head-waters of the Holston. Leaving them thus employed, let us repair to the head-quarters of the enemy. In the handsome parlor of a handsome house, in the suburbs of Lynchburg, we find two officers seated at a game of piquet. The hour is nine at night. The room is richly furnished. A bright fire burns on the hearth, and the blaze of sconce and astral lamps sheds its soft, luxurious, moonlight beams into every corner. Wine, cordials, fruits, and cigars are placed on a table, and every-thing betokens comfort and luxury, ease and indolence. The dress of these officers corresponds with the scene. Both glitter with gold and flutter in lace, and their richly mounted swords and highly finished pistols, which lie on the table, show that the owners abound in the means of display and self-indulgence. Such was indeed the fact. The pay of the army, gradually increased by law during thirty years, had grown to a noble revenue. The emoluments, as they are called, under a system of fraud and connivance, had advanced (without law) yet more rapidly; so that to be a Colonel in the army of the United States was to be a rich man. Such was the rank of both these officers. It was true that the treasury had already begun to feel the drain of the vast sums accumulated under an iniquitous tariff, and now employed to fortify the tyranny that had enforced that pernicious system. The loss of the southern trade gave reason to fear that the supply now on hand, if once exhausted, would not be speedily renewed. But the rulers felt but the more sensibly that the energetic employment both of force and corruption was necessary to retain the little that remained, by holding Virginia in subjection. With this view, the same system of wasteful expenditure, commenced twenty years before, was kept up; and all who served the crown with becoming zeal were encouraged to hold open their mouths that they might be filled. In another part of the room a company of subalterns fluttered around a bevy of fair damsels. To these young ladies the mistress of this mansion had of late become an object of much increased regard. No friend was so dear, no society so desirable, no house so pleasant to visit at as hers. Many an extra visit did she receive, since the abounding loyalty of her husband had invited the commandant of the post to make it his head-quarters. Many a wistful glance had been cast during the evening, from the assiduous subalterns, toward the handsome and unheeding wearer of two epaulettes, to whose authority all who approached him were bound to bow. But it was all in vain. Sufficient to himself, he valued not the admiring eyes which were bent upon him; or if they occupied any thing of his attention, it was to be made the subject of invidious comparison with the ladies of the highest fashion in the northern cities, whose lavish attentions had rendered him totally heedless of the vulgar admiration of a parcel of half-bred Virginia girls. These remarks, however, apply to only one of the officers in question. The other manifested no such insensibility, though his attentions to the fair were only marked by a staid courtesy, hardly more flattering than the perfect indifference of his companion. Still he paid such attention as it becomes a gentleman to pay to every thing that wears the exterior of a lady. But the day when he was himself an object of court to them was past. Indeed, the ladies had already begun to despair of thawing the coldness of his temperament, when, being superseded by a younger and handsomer commander, he was laid on the shelf and condemned as quite passé. But it is high time to make the reader acquainted with the two military gentlemen, to whose presence he has been introduced. The reader, without doubt, already understands that, of the two officers before us, the elder in years, though the younger in commission, is Col. Mason, late commandant of the post. His companion is Col. Owen Trevor, whose impatience for distinction has been indulged by sending him to Lynchburg with his regiment. Here, taking rank of Mason, he has been in fact placed in command of a brigade, with an understanding that time and opportunity will be afforded him to show himself qualified for the rank, by discharging the functions of a brigadier. This post has been assigned him because in this direction is the only enemy actually in arms. Although the force under the command of Douglas had been originally but a handful, Mason had seen that it possessed, in a marvellous degree, the faculty of occasional expansion. His intelligence had taught him to expect that it would ere long be greatly increased, if not crushed by a vigorous movement on his part. Hence he was desirous of acting on the offensive, especially as he had no doubt, from the past, that Lynchburg was the object of Douglas. But he had seen enough of the character and resources of his enemy to know that a small force would be unavailing, and had therefore earnestly desired to be reinforced. In answer to this request he had received, not the moderate aid that he had desired, but an order to surrender his command to Col. Trevor, whose well-appointed regiment was ordered to the post. Col. Mason was a man of honor and talent. He was one of the many subjects of that strong delusion which had so extensively prevailed; and, under the influence of which, Virginia, for thirty years, had been sacrificing the substance of liberty and prosperity to the forms of a constitution devised to secure, but perverted to destroy them. He belonged, moreover, to that unfortunate class of partisans whom it is safe to neglect. Acting on principles, however erroneous, it was clearly seen that these alone were sufficient to bind him to the service to which he had devoted himself. It was at the same time little doubted that a change of opinions would be followed by a renunciation of all the advantages of his situation, whatever they might be. To waste on such a man the means of corrupting the corruptible, and securing the faithless, would indeed have been “ridiculous excess.” He had won his way to his present rank by the strict performance of every duty of the subordinate offices, through which he had risen by regular gradation. In the shuffling and cutting of the military pack, he had seen junior officers placed above him by that sort of legerdemain which had so long before procured his master the name of the magician. He had not indeed acquiesced tamely in this, but means had been always found to soothe him, and he had been retained in the service by dextrous appeals to that magnanimity which they who knew not how to appreciate, yet knew well how to play upon. But he had not yet forgotten how, ten years before, some pretext had been found for reversing the relative rank of himself and Col. Trevor, when both were very young and both subalterns. But on that occasion, as usual, some complimentary though temporary arrangement had been devised to reconcile him to that which gave the rank of Captain to one, whom he, still a Lieutenant, had once commanded. Having repressed his dissatisfaction at that time, he now felt bound to acquiesce in the circumstances which placed his former subordinate immediately in authority over him. If this occurrence made him repent his former tameness, now when it was too late to remonstrate, he did not say so, but addressed himself with grave precision to the fulfilment of all his commander's orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVI. Fortuna nimium quem fovet, stultum facit. Colonel Trevor was the spoiled child of fortune and patronage. He was old enough to remember his father's rise in life. Hence, in estimating his consequence in society, he had formed a habit of comparing him with the class from which he sprung, and not with that more intellectual order of men, in which he had at last found his proper place, and where he had long remained stationary in well ascertained equality. This circumstance alone made an important difference between him and his younger brothers. The sort of retrospect with which he was most familiar teaches any thing but humility, however it may impress that lesson on the mind that has already learned it. In the commencement of Col. Trevor's military career, the approbation of his father had been of more consequence to the usurper than now, when his throne stood strong on its own foundations. The character of that worthy gentleman, too, had been less understood. The President had not been aware how absolutely the convictions of his own mind and his high sense of duty supplied the place of those douceurs, the frequent repetition and continued expectation of which is necessary to bind the faith of the unprincipled. Before this discovery was made, Col. Trevor had been already advanced to a rank, and invested with an adventitious consequence, which made it important to cultivate him on his own account. His early training had taught him the grand maxim of the court: “Nothing ask, nothing have.” He had discovered that any display of fixed principle, however favorable to the usurper's plans, was no passport to advancement; that rewards were only for the mercenary, and that they were always dispensed with a freedom duly proportioned to the eagerness with which they were sought. The caustic wit of John Randolph had unintentionally and almost with his last breath supplied the faction with a countersign not to be mistaken. If any man talked about his principles, (as all men do and must at times,) there was always at hand some dextrous pimp, whose business it was to ascertain their number. If they were found to be either more or less than seven, the discovery was fatal to his hopes of advancement. The character of Douglas Trevor had been formed under circumstances directly the reverse of those which had operated on his elder brother. He only remembered his father in the same circles and the same place in society in which his latter days had been spent. No change of condition had led the youth to turn his back on the companions of his boyhood; no 12 † rapid promotion had filled him with a fond conceit of his own consequence, or an overweening eagerness for rank and emolument; and his unbought fidelity had shown that he was of the number of those on whom rewards would be wasted. Thus it happened, (as it so often does,) that two young men, sons of the same parents, educated in the same school, and trained to the same profession, were just the reverse of each other, in particulars wherein nature had probably made little difference between them. So it was, that while the one was indifferent to duty, frivolous, self-indulgent, and mercenary, the other was assiduous, discreet, temperate, and disinterested. It may be inferred from what I have said, that the rank of Col. Trevor was already above his merit. The consequence was, that having reached his present elevation by the force of causes not within himself, his own consciousness afforded no standard for his farther pretensions. He could see no reason why he should not be a field-marshal as well as a colonel. And so it was; for he had no just claims to either rank on the score of service or qualification. A stone thrown up, were it endued with consciousness and thought, could see no reason, as long as it was ascending, why it might not fly to the moon. If my experience in life has taught me any thing, it is, that a man who sets no bounds to his aspirations, unless his daily intercourse with the world affords daily proofs of an intrinsic superiority over all he meets, is already raised above his merit. The gentlemen, of whom I have been speaking, were busily engaged in their game, when the Orderly in waiting entered and announced an officer who wished to report himself to the commandant of the post. “Let him call in the morning, and be damned to him,” said Col. Trevor. “Is this an hour to disturb a gentleman?” The Orderly saluted and withdrew, but presently returned to say that the officer had particular business with Colonel Mason, and wished to see him immediately. Mason accordingly left the room, and was gone but a few minutes, when he too came back. “This officer, sir,” said he, “asked to see me, supposing me still in command here. His intelligence is for you; and, from what I heard before I discovered his mistake, it may be important that you should receive it to-night.” “Well,” said Trevor, in a tone at once lazy and peevish, “I suppose I must see him. But it is damned hard that I cannot have a moment's leisure. Let him come in.” He was summoned accordingly, and proved to be no other than our acquaintance, the Yankee spy, whom I now introduce to the reader, as he announced himself. He is Captain Amos Cottle, of the 20th regiment of infantry, in the army of the United States. His name, I presume, (like that of the fourteen James Thomsons, in Don Juan,) had been bestowed in honor of the illustrious bard immortalized by Lord Byron. He was invited to take a glass of wine, and, having seated himself, requested a private conference with the commanding officer. This was a signal for the dispersion of the ladies, and their assiduous attendants, who adjourned to another room. Mason was about to follow, but the Colonel carelessly requested him to remain. Captain Cottle was then invited to open his budget, which he did by telling what the reader already knows. Not a sentence did he utter, in which some indication of folly, vanity, or indiscretion did not escape him. All this, however, passed unmarked of Col. Trevor, whose eyes sparkled at the welcome intelligence. Nothing could be more apropos to his wishes, or to the plan of the President. “Veni, vidi, vici.” The exploit of Cæsar was the only parallel to that which he proposed to achieve. Occasionally he looked to Mason for sympathy and concurrence with his unexpressed thoughts. As often he withdrew his eye, chilled and perplexed by the cold, steady, thoughtful look of his companion. What could this mean? Could Mason be insensible to the advantage of the plot, or indifferent to its issue? Could envy so far prevail with a man heretofore distinguished by his disinterested zeal for the service, as to damp his ardor in an enterprise of so much promise? He was at first indignant at this idea, but a little reflection made him judge his brother-officer with more candor. “Poor Mason,” said he to himself. “I don't wonder that he is a little mortified at my good fortune. It is something hard that he should have held this post so long, without a chance to do any thing, and that I should have come just in time to rob him of this. But then, damn it! it is his own fault. What did he want with a reinforcement against a parcel of ragged militia? It was right to supersede an officer who would ask more than one regiment to meet any number of such ragamuffins that could come against him. Besides, he ought to have broken up their den long ago. If Douglas escapes me this time, it shall not be long before I smoke him out of his hole, or there is no virtue in gun-powder.” Having thus reasoned himself into a state of exquisite self-complacency, he heard the story of Captain Cottle to the end, and then asked the opinion of Mason. “I cannot say,” replied that gentleman, “that I am prepared to give an opinion.” “I hope,” said Trevor, “that you don't mean to deny me the benefit of your thoughts.” “So far from it, that I make it a point of conscience not to speak without having first thought. When I have done so, I will tell you what I think. To speak now would be but to give you the crude 12 † suggestions of unreflecting and impertinent presumption.” “I cannot understand,” said Trevor, “how you can require time to think in so plain a case.” “I might say, in reply,” answered Mason, “that as the case is so clear to you, you can hardly need my advice. Indeed, I understand your request of it but as a compliment to which I am not insensible, and which I shall not decline. When I am prepared to speak, therefore, I shall speak as plainly as if the case were as full of difficulty to you as it is to me.” Having said this, Mason drew Cottle into conversation; enquired the particulars of his visit to the mountain; encouraged him to recite his conversations with Douglas; and, filling him full of vanity and conceit by his deferential deportment, made the light shine through him, so as to expose his folly to the most careless observer. At length he was dismissed for the night, and Mason, addressing Trevor, said: “I am now ready to give you my thoughts. I could not do so in Captain Cottle's presence; and, indeed, my mind was not clear until I had some more conversation with him. I am now satisfied.” “Let's hear, then, the result of your cogitations,” asked Trevor, with something of a sneer. Mason colored slightly, but said, in a calm tone: “I have had some experience of this Captain Douglas, and am morally sure he has not been deceived by this man, as he supposes.” “What!” exclaimed Trevor. “Do you forget that Captain Cottle is an officer whose rank is a pledge for his honor, and who would forfeit his commission and his life by bringing false intelligence to his commander?” “I don't doubt his truth,” said Mason, “but his sagacity I do doubt. The man is palpably a Yankee—” “And the cunning of the Yankee is proverbial,” interrupted Trevor. “It is, indeed,” replied Mason; “but as he is not only a Yankee, but obviously so, he could not have made Douglas believe that he was an influential inhabitant of Bedford, a native of the county, and a zealous stickler for the sovereignty of Virginia.” “You give your Captain Douglas credit for a great deal of sagacity.” “And not without reason,” said Mason. “His plans, and his manner of conducting them, all show it. His intelligence appears to be always correct and ready, and his devices for the concealment of his own schemes are commonly impenetrable. It is clear, from many circumstances, that he has agents who pass through the country unsuspected; and I should not be surprised if Cottle had fallen in with one of them. I have no doubt that Douglas will be found at Jones's Ford on the day appointed; but my life upon it, instead of coming there to be surprised, he proposes to come there to surprise you.” “Surprise ME!” said Trevor, scornfully. “I have no apprehension that he will surprise you,” said Mason, “because I am sure you will take all proper precaution. I merely mean to say that he will attempt it.” “And be punished for his presumption,” said Trevor. “As to precaution, I must use it, to be sure, superfluous as it may be against a set of inexperienced militia.” “Of one sort of experience,” said Mason, “and that not the least important, they have had more than we. They have tasted danger more than once; and their skill in the use of the rifle is such as men who live with the weapon in their hands, and they alone, can be expected to acquire.” “I hope to bring in some of them as prisoners,” said Trevor, “and then we shall see how that is. I will pit a dozen of our sharp-shooters against a dozen of them, my horse to yours.” “I am not in the habit of betting,” replied Mason, smiling quietly; “but, in this case, I dare say I may do it innocently, as the offence will hardly reach beyond intention; so I take your bet.” “How do you mean?” asked Trevor, sharply. “I mean,” said Mason, “that I am not very sure that you will take a dozen of them.” “Not sure!” exclaimed Trevor; “how can they escape me?” “I don't profess to understand their craft,” said Mason; “but they are hard to catch. In short, Colonel Trevor, my instructions require me to afford you all the information I have acquired here. It is therefore my duty, even without question from you, to assure you that you are in the midst of a disaffected country, and that you are going against an enemy not to be despised, and among a people universally hostile. Knowing these things, and invited by you to advise what is to be done in this affair, my advice is to march your whole disposable force to the appointed place, using every precaution to guard against surprise. It might be as well to anticipate Douglas, so far at least as to understand the ground, and to occupy it before the day.” “And so he takes warning, and escapes me.” “By no means. Cottle's scheme will have been made available so far as to draw him down from the mountains. You neither need nor desire any other advantage. But I see that I cannot easily make myself understood, because our minds are occupied with different things. You are thinking about the trap set for Douglas, and I am thinking about the snare he has laid for you. Depend upon it, Colonel Trevor, that the old story of catching a Tartar, may be illustrated by catching Douglas among the river hills. He may be caught; and yet, neither come away nor let you come. Observe,” continued Mason, “when I inquired of this Captain Cottle about the nature of the ground at the Ford, behold, he had not taken notice of it! but, on cross-examination, by finding what he did not see, I am satisfied that there is no low ground, nor cleared land at the place; that the hills come sheer down to the river, and, by almost necessary consequence, that the road leads through a deep defile. The choice of such a place confirms my suspicion of Douglas's plan, and affords the means to counterwork it. If we occupy the strong points of the ground, and he comes with only such a body of men as Cottle expects, we take him without effusion of blood. If he comes in force, our position will give us all the advantage he seeks; and, trust me, in that case we shall have need of them.” “Need of advantages against irregulars!” drawled Trevor, sneeringly, and emphasizing every word. “Our discipline and experience are of little consequence,” said Mason, “if we do not use them. One use of them is to know how to take advantages.” “Be it so,” said Trevor; “I shall seek none. A fair field and a clear sky are all I ask; and I shall be careful to take no measures which may alarm this mountain wolf, and drive him back to his den before I can come up with him.” These words were hardly spoken when the Orderly announced that a sergeant of dragoons had just returned from a scouting party with important intelligence, and had come to make his report to the Colonel. What this was the reader will infer, when told that he was the non-commissioned officer on whom had devolved the command of the four men who had escaped with him from Jones's Ford. His information confirmed Mason's suspicions, and might have served as a damper to the flattering anticipations of a man less sanguine than Colonel Trevor. Its only effect on him was to sharpen his eagerness for the expected rencontre. Yet the Sergeant, when questioned, frankly admitted that his party had not been out-numbered. But it was clear that their design had been, by some means, disclosed to Douglas; and his advantage had been the result of judicious dispositions, and the skill of his men in the use of that most terrible of all weapons. But all this abated nothing of Colonel Trevor's contempt for a foe unskilled in the manual exercise, ignorant of the grand manoelig;uvres, and dressed in buckskin. Every attempt on the part of Col. Mason to bring him to listen to reason proved fruitless. Indeed the conversation occasionally took such a turn as to create a doubt in the mind of that gentleman, whether to press his advice any farther might not make it difficult to reconcile with his own self-respect the deference which he knew to be due to his commander. He therefore determined to receive and execute in silence all orders which might be given, and leave the event to Providence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVII. More dreadful far their ire Than theirs, who, scorning danger's name, In eager mood to battle came; Their valor, like light straw on flame, A fierce, but fading fire! Freed at length from his troublesome adviser, Col. Trevor was left to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his anticipated triumph. He seemed to tread on air, and, with a flashing eye, and spread nostrils, to look forward to the glories, and snuff up the carnage of the expected fight. Such was his impatience for the adventure, that, in the eagerness of anticipation, he gave no thought to the necessary preparations. It was enough to issue the customary order for the troops to be in readiness for the march, with a supply of cartridges and rations suitable to the expedition. The third day of November at length arrived, and the troops took up the line of march. As they issued in glittering rank from the barracks above the town, the Colonel, proudly mounted on his stately charger, posted himself in the gateway of the house, where he had taken up his quarters, and received their passing salute. The portico of the house was crowded with female figures; the windows were clustered with fair faces; the noble oak-trees in the yard were hung with garlands, in token of the loyalty of the household, and of anticipated triumph in his assured victory. But the Colonel saw nothing of this. His eye saw not the waving of handkerchiefs, his ear heard not the cheering farewells issuing in tones of music from rosy lips. He heard only the spirit-stirring drum and clanging bugle; he saw nothing but the stately steppings of his well-trained troops as they marched by; and then, his eye, following them, dwelt with delight upon their picturesque appearance as they wound along the slope of the hill, and crossed Blackwater-bridge. Beyond this, imagination presented objects of yet greater interest,—the battle-field, the tumult of the strife, the rout, the pursuit, the carnage, the vanquished leader led in chains to the foot of the throne, the gracious smile of approving majesty, and the rich rewards of successful valor. These things he saw; but saw not the gaunt figure of his host, who stood near, his strong features and manly person illy sorting with the abject part he condemned himself to act. He sought in vain to catch the eye of the excited commander, desirous, in his parting words, to convey some expression of loyalty and zeal. Colonel Trevor marked him not; and, as the rear 13 † of the column was about to pass, put spurs to his horse, and galloped to the front. At this point of my story, I must crave the indulgence of the reader, while I introduce my humble self to his notice. A native of South Carolina, and the heir of a goodly inheritance, which, during a long minority, had been at nurse in the hands of an honest and prudent guardian, I was just of age, the master of a handsome income, and of a large sum of money in hand. Having a taste for military life, my guardian had procured me a situation in the military academy, which had been established by the State, as a counterpoise to that institution at which the Federal Government had taught so many of our southern youths to whet their swords against the only sovereignty to which they owed allegiance. My proficiency had been seen, and gave entire satisfaction to my teachers. I had imbibed political opinions which made me a zealous advocate for the rights of the States, and a strenuous assertor of the unalienable independence of South Carolina. When, in compliance with the request of Mr. B—, enquiry had been made for a young man qualified and disposed to aid young Trevor in his enterprise, I had been selected for that purpose. I was invited to Columbia; made acquainted with the plans of the insurgents in Virginia, and provided with letters to my future commander. Journeying to Virginia by the route that he had pursued, on the evening of the first day of November I entered the valley described in the first chapter. I soon encountered a crowd of men, who filled the road and the yard of a house contiguous to it. There were wagons, horses, and arms; and the men, moving quietly but busily, seemed all earnestly engaged in some important preparation. I was presently stopped, courteously though peremptorily; and having expressed a wish to see Captain Douglas, was conducted to the house. There, pen in hand, and busily engaged in writing, sat a young man of small stature and slight figure. Though quite handsome, there was nothing remarkable in his features, but a bright gray eye, of calm, thoughtful, and searching expression, strongly contrasted with the dark brown curling hair that clustered over his brow. Being accosted by my conductor, he raised his head; when I stepped forward, and handed him my letters. He glanced hastily to the signature of the first he opened, then read it leisurely, and looking at me with a beaming countenance, extended his hand. “You are welcome, sir,” said he; “welcome to danger's hour. In the morning we march on an expedition which may decide the fate of the campaign. My engagements must excuse my seeming neglect of you this evening. But let me make you known to your future comrades.” Then turning to a fair haired youth, already known to the reader as Arthur Trevor, he introduced him as his mother's son. I was then made acquainted with Schwartz and Witt, and several others. Among the number were a few young men from the lower counties, of good families and education, who, in this crisis, had left their homes to engage in this expedition. These, like their leader, had all learned to accommodate themselves to the fashions of that wild country, and its wilder climate, and especially to their own wild life. Each individual was dressed, from top to toe, in leather, no otherwise differing from the dress of the rudest mountaineer, than in neatness, and a certain easy grace, and air of fashion, which no dress can entirely conceal. In any dress, in any company, under any circumstances, Douglas Trevor would have been recognized as a gentleman. I hardly remember how I fared, or how I passed the night. As a stranger, I presume somewhat better than most others; but I took pains to show that I was content to eat what I could get, and to lodge as I might. At daylight we were on the road. But little attention was paid to order. No enemy was near, and nobody was inclined to desert. There was therefore no necessity for harassing men and horses, by forcing them to keep in ranks. Each man rode where, and with whom he pleased, except that a few were directed to keep near the wagons, not so much to guard as to assist in case of need. It is impossible to conceive a military array, with less of the “pomp and circumstance of war.” The horses were, for the most part, substantial, and in substantial order. Their equipments were of the rudest sort. Plough-bridles and pack-saddles were most common. The only arms were the rifle, knife, and tomahawk, with their appropriate accompaniments of powder-horn, charger, and pouch. Douglas, indeed, had a sword, and the few sabres taken from the dragoons had been distributed among the principal men. But they were all too wise to encumber their persons with these weapons, which might have been troublesome in their mode of warfare. A strong loop of thick leather, stitched to the skirt of the saddle, in front of the left knee, received the sword, the hilt of which stood up above the pummel. Two or three of the saddles were of the Spanish fashion, the horn of which served to support any trifle the rider might wish to hang on it. Douglas, in particular, carried, in this way, a leather case, containing his writing materials, and serving as a tablet for writing on horseback. But rude as these equipments were, yet to one acquainted with the object of the expedition, there was an appearance of efficiency in the whole which gave the corps a truly formidable aspect. The perfect order of the arms, the strong though rude dress of the men, their sinewy frames, their sunburnt faces; and, above all, the serious and resolved expression of countenace which generally 13 † prevailed, were tokens which none but a martinet would overlook. As yet no duty had been assigned to me, so that I was perfectly disengaged. It was not until we had rode several miles, that Douglas found leisure to converse with me. He then joined me, accompanied by Schwartz, to whom, in my presence, he explained my situation. Schwartz heard him with thoughtful attention, and then said: “It is all mighty well, sir, if Mr. Sidney will only just take it right. You see, sir,” continued he, addressing me, “there an't no officers among us, and we only just call the Captain so for short. If he was a Captain or a Gineral it would not make much odds, because these fellows just go for what is right and hard fighting; and him they believe in, him they mind. But as to who is first and who is second, that's neither here nor there. I have not a doubt that you are the sort of a man we want; but all that we can do, is to give you a fair chance to let the men see it. The Captain can be asking your advice, now and then, and I and Witt will do the same, and when they see that, they will begin to find out what you are. And then, you see, sir, when once we get to fighting, a man is never in such a flurry himself, but what he can see who knows what he is about, and who does not. So, by the time we have had a skrimmage or two, the men will know all about you; and whenever the Captain is out of the way, they will all be looking to you to know what to do; just in the way of giving your opinion, mind; but, after a while, it will get to be orders. And then, if any thing happens to the Captain, and Witt and I don't see cause to change our mind, why, we only just have to follow you, and the men they follow us, and all will go straight. So you must just make yourself easy and keep quiet. We'll tell you when to speak, and after a while you'll find yourself second in command before you know it.” I had no difficulty in acknowledging the reasonableness of these ideas, though it seemed a new thing to find a man possessing the influence and authority of Schwartz, devising means to transfer them to another. But he knew, and the event showed that he was right, that there were some duties of a commander for which he was not fit; and that there were other things to which a chief could not devote himself, for which he was better qualified than any other. On the third of November we reached the rendezvous, at the house of Mr. Gordon. On the way we had received frequent accessions of strength, and here we were joined by a yet larger reinforcement. Our whole number could not have been much, if at all, short of a thousand men. Meantime scouts came in, from whom we learned that the same day had been fixed for the march of the troops from Lynchburg. It followed that we had abundance of time for our preparations. It so happened, that they had not learned the name of the new commander; but it was understood that a reinforcement had arrived, and that nearly the whole disposable force was on the march. This included a troop of dragoons and a company of artillery, with two pieces of cannon, in addition to a full regiment of infantry, and one battalion of another. Having ascertained his force, and fixed on those on whom he could rely to understand and execute his plans, Douglas proceeded to make a temporary organization, suited to the occasion. The men were divided into corps, to each of which a post was provisionally assigned, to be occupied as soon as the approach of the enemy should be announced. Across the road, near the head of the defile, and just above the first angle next the top of the ascent, was constructed a barricade of logs, similar to those already described. This reached, on each side, to the foot of the hills, at steep, rocky, and impracticable points. It was long enough for twenty men to man its twenty loop-holes, and as it reached above their heads, they were quite concealed. An hundred men were allotted to this post, who were ranged five deep behind the barricade, and instructed to fire in turn, each man falling back to the rear to reload as soon as he had discharged his piece. Others were distributed along the opposite faces of the hills overlooking the road, and directed to seek out hiding-places behind rocks, trees, and bushes. These men were under the immediate orders of individuals selected for the occasion, but attached to the command of Witt, who was stationed at the barrier. About a hundred were placed in ambush in the mouth of the ravine, just below the road, on the north side of the river, under Schwartz. These were all picked men—our steadiest and coolest sharp-shooters—who were placed there for the purpose of attacking and carrying the guns of the enemy at the water's edge. Douglas himself, at the head of the rest of his corps, prepared to occupy the road on the north side of the river, to bring on the action. These were divided into two equal bodies, and the whole ranged in platoons, at open order, across the road. Of the two battalions, as they may be called, the foremost was placed under my command. The other Douglas commanded in person. My orders were to post my headmost platoon just at the bend of the road, on the top of the hill where it turns to the right. They were instructed to fire ad libitum, each man choosing and making sure of his mark, and then to file away by the right, and, taking to their heels, to run down to the river, cross it, and dispose themselves on the other bank, so as most effectually to gall the enemy, should he attempt to cross. Each platoon, in succession, was to march up to the same ground, and, having fired, to execute the same manœuvre. The remaining column, under Douglas, were to stand their ground until the enemy should come in view on the top of the hill, and then to fall back fighting, and cross under cover of those who should have passed before. But the best account of what was ordered will be gathered from what was done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXVIII. The triumph and the vanity, The rapture of the strife; The earthquake voice of victory, To thee the breath of life; All quelled:—Dark spirit, what must be The madness of thy memory? While these arrangements were in progress, scouts were hourly arriving. The country being altogether friendly, they were readily provided with fresh horses; and, before the enemy were half way from Lynchburg, we were fully apprised of their number, equipments, and order of march. First came a squadron of dragoons; then a light company; then Trevor's regiment, about five hundred strong; then a company of artillery; then one battalion of Mason's regiment, consisting of something more than two hundred men; the whole followed by a few light troops, by way of rear-guard. The whole might amount to a thousand men, well appointed and prepared at all points for efficient action. On the morning of the fifth of November, the men were ordered to betake themselves to their allotted posts; and Douglas, having visited each, and seen that all was right, and rightly understood, addressed himself to his particular command. Where every man is an officer, each must be told individually beforehand what is expected from him. Panic apart, they will be apt to fulfil such instructions, and will fight with the terrible efficiency of individual animosity. Hence the formidable character of partisan warfare. At length the enemy made their appearance. Clinging to the idea of surprising Douglas, Col. Trevor sent forward no advance, but determined to bring the whole strength of his corps to bear upon him at once. If he employed any scouts, they were either unfaithful, or were not permitted to approach near enough to learn any thing of the position or movements of Douglas. The consequence was, that Col. Trevor received the first intimation of his presence from a sharp firing in front, which sent his horse to the right-about and back to the rear. Pressing forward, he immediately ordered his sharp-shooters to disperse and take positions to gall us, while he pushed on his solid column of heavy infantry. The reception prepared for them was such as he had not dreamed of. His men fell like leaves in autumn; and, as fast as one platoon of the mountaineers discharged their pieces, another was on the same ground to pour in again that terrible fire, of which the martinets of the regular service have so inadequate an idea. Instead of the deep-mouthed peal of muskets, discharged simultaneously, there is the sharp, short crack of rifle after rifle, fired by men no one of whom touches the trigger until he sees precisely where his ball is to go. The effect was suitable to the cause; but yet the steady infantry pressed on, “Each stepping where his comrade stood,” to form an unbroken front, in order to charge with the bayonet. Suddenly the firing ceased, and, behold, their enemy seemed to have fled from the expected charge. The fact was, that my last platoon, having fired, had withdrawn like their predecessors, and were running at full speed after their companions, down the hill and across the river. At the water's edge, I stopped and joined Schwartz in his ambush. It had been arranged that I should do this; because, in case we should be so fortunate as to seize the cannon, my skill as an artillerist might be of great use. Meantime, my men having crossed over, dispersed themselves along the bank, the face of the hills, and across the road, to cover the retreat of those who remained. The regulars had necessarily spent a few moments in repairing the wreck of their shattered column before they advanced. They then moved forward; but, before they turned the angle of the road, most of my men were across the river. At the same time, the column under the immediate command of Douglas 14 † was seen drawn up in the road, near the foot of the hill, with the rear resting on the water's edge. As the enemy advanced the front platoon fired, faced to the right, and filing along the flank of the column, entered the river and crossed just below the ford. They next filed to the left in the same way, and crossed above the ford. In this manner the whole column disappeared, one platoon after another, while their fire was answered by a roar of musketry, which, being discharged from the higher ground, did more harm to those on the farther bank of the river than to the nearer enemy. At length the last platoon was withdrawn, and the regulars rushed down toward the river for the purpose of annoying them in crossing. In this attempt they were again checked and driven back by the terrible fire of my men, who, having already crossed, were drawn up, as I have said, on the other bank. Col. Trevor now saw the necessity of advancing his artillery, which was accordingly hurried down to the water's edge to clear a passage for the infantry. By the time the cannon were untimbered, not a man of the mountaineers was to be seen. As soon as their companions had crossed, they dispersed with every appearance of confusion and alarm; some scampering along the road, and some clambering up the hills on both sides of it. The way was now open, and the infantry advanced to cross the river. At this moment Colonel Mason, riding up to Colonel Trevor, pointed out the advantageous position of the artillery as a cover to his rear, if he should be forced to retreat. “Give me leave to suggest,” said he, “that it may be well to leave the cannon where they are. The cavalry, too, cannot act with effect among those hills, and the two together, should the fortune of the day be unpropitious, may be of more use here than on the other side.” “You say true,” said Trevor. “It shall be as you advise, and you, Colonel, will remain in command of this reserve.” “I earnestly beg, sir,” said Mason, “that you will not deny me a share in the work of the day. The Captains of artillery and dragoons are all-sufficient to the command of their respective corps.” “Pardon me, sir,” said Trevor. “None can be so proper to execute your prudent and cautious device as you, its author. You will be pleased, therefore, to repair to the rear, rally the dragoons, and bring them down to the water's edge. Let them be ready to cross at a moment's warning, to assist in the pursuit as soon as I have driven the enemy into the plain.” Saying this, Colonel Trevor turned off, and giving the word to march, dashed into the river. Poor Mason, insulted and mortified, nevertheless patiently addressed himself to the duty assigned him. Thus was this able and brave man denied all participation in an affair which his arrogant and sanguine commander believed to be an abounding source of honor to all who might be engaged it. I have omitted to mention that, as soon as the plan of endeavoring to surprise the artillery had been adopted, Schwartz had requested me to draw the outline of a piece of mounted ordnance in the sand, and to mark the proper positions of the artillerists employed about it. While I did this, some ten or fifteen of our best marksmen stood by, looking on attentively. When my sketch was done, he turned to one of them, and pointing to one of the marks made to stand for an artillerist, said coolly: “Now, this is your man;” and to another, “this is yours.” Thus he went on till he had doomed every victim. While we are supplying this omission in our narrative, the reader will please to suppose that Col. Trevor's regiment have forded the river, and have passed up the road and out of sight. It will be remembered that the hills on both sides of the defile had been lined with concealed marksmen, and that the greater part of the advance had, on recrossing the river, thrown themselves into the same places of concealment. But the idea that they had done so for any purpose but that of safety, entered not into Col. Trevor's mind. Indeed, if he had had any doubt, it must have been removed when he found, that as his column wound through the deep defile, not a shot molested their march. At the first angle of the road he halted and let the column march past him. He could see, from this point, both the head of it, as it advanced, and the rear as it came up. As the latter passed the spot where he stood, the leading platoon was in the act of turning the next angle of the road. At that moment he heard the startling report of a volley of rifles. He set spurs to his horse to gallop to the front, when every rock and every tree of the surrounding hills burst into flame, and the deep ravine echoed to the report of a hundred rifles. A shot struck his horse, and another piercing his hat, grazed the top of his head deep enough to lay bare the skull, and stun him, as he fell under his slaughtered horse. He was thus placed hors du combat, owing the preservation of his life to the insignia of his rank which had endangered it. The sound of this firing was the signal for us. Each of the selected marksmen fixed his aim on his appropriate victim; and, at a word from Schwartz, the artillerymen at the guns fell as if swept away by the breath of a tempest. Rushing from our hiding-place, the cannon were instantly in our possession. The company of artillery were not slow to disappear behind the angle of the rock, and one or two who peeped out, being instantly picked off, we saw no more of them. Presently we heard the heavy tramp of the squadron slowly descending the hill, accompanied with the peculiar sound of dragoons, dressing the front in 14 † preparation for a sudden and overwhelming charge. While this was passing, our guns were all reloaded. “Mind, boys,” said Schwartz; “all of number one.” The word was understood, and every alternate man stood ready, with rifle cocked and trigger set, to receive the enemy. The charge was sounded, and the leading horsemen, wheeling around the rock, were rushing on at full speed, when horses and riders were seen to go down in one promiscuous heap. The greater number of the squadron were still out of sight; and, had the way been open, might have followed to share the fate of their companions, and finally to ride us down when our guns should have been all discharged. But the work had been done too effectually. The dead and wounded (both horse and rider) nearly filled the road; and for dragoons to pick their way among such appalling obstacles, in the face of fifty loaded rifles, at a distance of twenty paces, was out of the question. A few who made the attempt found this to their cost. The charge was not renewed, and some of our men advancing to the angle of the rock, and occupying inaccessible but commanding points on the hills, soon made them draw off to a safe distance. While this was doing, I, with the few men selected for the service of the artillery, gave my attention to that. Glancing my eye along both pieces, I saw that both had been accurately pointed into the road on the other side. I had nothing, therefore, to do but to apply the port-fire, which was still burning in the clenched hand of a dead artillerist. By this time the column had fallen back, and the road below the first angle was fast filling with the retreating mass. I had never before witnessed the effusion of blood; and, heated as mine now was, it ran cold as I applied the match. As the smoke cleared off, I saw the enemy throwing away their arms, and stretching out their hands, some toward me, and some aloft to the unseen foe that galled them from the hills. The fire instantly slackened, and cravats and handkerchiefs being raised on the points of swords and bayonets, it ceased altogether. The mountaineers now poured down from the hills into the ravine, securing the arms of the enemy, mixing among them and hemming them in on every side. Douglas, whose place, since he had recrossed the river, had been among these concealed marksmen, was one of the first to approach the enemy. Advancing to those whose rank was most conspicuous, he made known his authority, and received their swords. Meantime Col. Trevor had recovered his senses, and found himself fastened to the ground by the weight of his horse, which lay upon his leg. He was presently discovered, relieved, and helped to rise. At this moment he caught the eye of Douglas, who hastened to him, less from impatience to demand his sword, than to offer assistance to one who seemed to be an officer of high rank, and badly wounded. In the figure before him, all smeared with blood and dirt, he saw nothing by which he could recognize his brother. To the Colonel, the disguise of Douglas was hardly less complete. He had seen him receiving the surrender of others, and stood prepared to go through the same humiliating ceremony. He felt that his own disgrace was complete, and the form of surrender was thought of with indifference. He had already reached the lowest depth of abasement. “But in that lowest depth a lower deep” seemed to open, when, as he extended his hand to deliver his sword to the victor, he discovered that the hand put forth to receive it was that of Douglas. He flung down his sword, stamping with rage, and immediately after called to his men to resume their arms. The voice struck the ear of Douglas, though dissonant with passion. The figure, too, confirmed his suspicion of the truth; and he immediately rushed to screen his brother with his own body from the rifles pointed against him. Calling for aid to those around, he presently succeeded in securing the Colonel, and after one or two fruitless attempts to soothe him, ordered him away to the house of Mr. Gordon. To that gentleman he spoke aside, and explaining in confidence the strange scene that he had just witnessed, besought him to take command of the escort, and to pay all imaginable attention to the health, comfort, and feelings of the Colonel. He was accordingly led away, raging and foaming at the mouth like a spoiled child who has been deprived of his toy, or baulked in his amusement. The mortification of Douglas was extreme; but he had the satisfaction to find that Arthur was not present; and to no other person but Schwartz and myself did the name of Colonel Trevor afford a hint of the connexion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIX. —If thou didst but consent To this most cruel act, do but despair; And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread That ever spider twisted from her womb Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be A beam to hang thee on! Or, wouldst thou drown thyself, Put but a little water in a spoon, And it shall be, as all the ocean, Enough to stifle such a villain! I shall not detain the reader with a detail of the farther particulars of this skirmish. Indeed we hardly staid to acquaint ourselves with its exact results. As at least half the men who had fought under Douglas on that day had no intention to follow him any farther, we left to them the care of the killed, wounded, and prisoners. The body of Col. Mason alone was selected for a more honorable burial than the rude hands of the mountaineers could bestow. It was dragged from beneath the incumbent mass of men and horses, placed on a suitable carriage, covered with the colors of his regiment, and taken to Lynchburg, to be there restored to his companions in arms. The band of his regiment were also marched to that place to assist in rendering the last honors to their late commander. Having given the necessary orders, Douglas snatched a moment to ride to Mr. Gordon's, where he hoped to find his brother in a more reasonable mood. The Colonel had been confined in a private room; and, being treated with great courtesy and respect, had lost nothing of his arrogance. Such is always the effect of delicate attention to the undeserving. A man of merit would have been softened and melted by the deference with which Colonel Trevor was treated. To him it seemed but that sort of spontaneous homage to greatness which the heart pays unconsciously. The effect of it was, that being told by Mr. Gordon that his brother had come to visit him in his room, he sent him the following magnanimous note, pencilled on the back of a letter: “I am your prisoner. Do with me as you please. Inflict on me any death, however cruel; but spare me the sight of one whose treasons have dishonored our common name, and who has deprived me of my only chance to restore its former splendor.” Douglas was inexpressibly shocked at this manifestation of a temper at once savage and coldly selfish. But he had no time to waste in parleying with the ungoverned passions of his brother, and wrote an answer in these words: “You are my prisoner, and mine only, and shall be treated with all tenderness and respect. I am responsible to no one for your custody, and you shall soon be at liberty. Go home. Go to our venerable father, and comfort his declining years. If the instincts of your heart do not restrain you from fighting against your brothers, (for Arthur is with me,) let a sense of honor make you regard yourself as a prisoner on parole, not at liberty to fight again against Virginia. Meantime your sword shall be restored, and you shall be treated in all things as the brother of D. T.” While Douglas was engaged in this painful duty, Arthur was employed in preparing a formal report of the events of the day. This was signed by the Chief on his return, and with it the young man was despatched to B—, with instructions to ask his orders, and return with them, unless another messenger should be preferred. In the meantime all things had been made ready for the march to Lynchburg. I shall not give the history of this. It was triumphal, as far as complete success and the applauding gratulations of the people could make it so. We had no difficulty in adding to our numbers as many men as the fruits of our victory enabled us to supply with arms. Some joined us instantly, and others engaged to rendezvous at Lynchburg in a few days. There was nothing to damp the pleasure of Douglas, but the conduct of his perverse brother, and the presence of the dead body of his old friend, Colonel Mason. On our arrival before the camp at Lynchburg, I received orders to present myself with a flag before the gate, at the head of a detachment which escorted the body, accompanied by the music of his band, and all the sad and imposing insignia of a military funeral. An officer came out to meet us, and thus received the first authentic history of the fate of the expedition. I was instructed to deliver over the body of Colonel Mason with every circumstance of respect and courtesy. I was also charged to demand the surrender of the entrenched camp, and of the garrison as prisoners of war. A negotiation ensued, which ended in a suspension of arms for five days, and an agreement to surrender if, in that time, no reinforcement arrived. This arrangement was by no means unwelcome to Douglas. It gave him time to receive and organize the new recruits that were pouring in, and to await the return of Arthur. In the meantime, much of that sort of intercourse which is common on such occasions took place. There are few things in life more pleasant than it is. There must be less of malignity in human nature than is generally supposed, or men would not seize, with so much eagerness, on opportunities to lose the idea of public hostility in the kindly interchange of courtesy and good offices. Friendships are never formed more suddenly and cordially than under such circumstances. So we found it on this occasion. Major Wood, the officer in command, was a gentleman 15 † and soldier, honorable, frank, generous, and accomplished. I was brought much into contact with him, and found him enthusiastic in his acknowledgments of the merits of Douglas, and eager to become acquainted with him. But the time had not come when he was willing to be known by his true name; and besides that he was acquainted with the Major, there were many others in the camp who would have recognized him. He therefore confined himself to his quarters, on various pleas of business; and, to make his seclusion effectual, took lodgings in a house in the suburbs of the town. By his advice, I mixed much with the men; and, as I had acquitted myself to their entire satisfaction in the late affair, I found that I was in a fair way to be recognized as second in command. Schwartz and Witt made a point of consulting me publicly on all occasions; and this circumstance, together with my daily attention to the organization of the troops, obtained me full credit for all my military skill, and a great deal more. The five days passed away quite pleasantly. The regulars, finding that they were not like to fall into the hands of savages, were becoming reconciled to the fate which now seemed inevitable; and we parted on the last night of the truce, with no unpleasant anticipations of the surrender which was to take place the next day at noon. The morning came, and our men paraded in high spirits, and with considerable show of order and discipline. This was particularly the case with a small company which had been detailed for the service of the artillery, who took their stand at the guns with the air of men proud of their new acquirements. I had indeed taken great pains to train and exercise them, and, by universal consent, was recognized as the immediate commander of this corps, which was drawn up with the cannon planted directly against the gate of the camp. All this time Douglas did not make his appearance. At length the hour approached for the garrison to march out, and lay down their arms, when Schwartz went to his quarters to receive his orders. He soon returned, and taking me aside, told me that Douglas was not at his quarters, and was nowhere to be seen. We had already observed appearances in the camp not at all answerable to the expected surrender, and I was now startled at this intelligence. The character of Major Wood forbade indeed any suspicion of foul play. But the time was near at hand when the enemy should march out, and we heard nothing of their drums, calling the men to parade. We determined, therefore, to send a flag to the camp on some pretext. The officer who carried it was immediately warned off, and having said that he had a communication for Major Wood, was told that that officer was no longer in command, and that Col. Trevor would receive no communication from rebels and traitors. This was decisive. The quarters of Douglas were not very distant from the enemy, and such had been the appearance of perfect good faith in all their proceedings, that our camp had been guarded even more negligently than is common with militia. It seemed, indeed, almost incredible that Col. Trevor could have been guilty of an act of base treachery against the life or liberty of his generous brother; but to Schwartz and myself, who knew the connexion, even this seemed hardly less extravagant than his former conduct. That he had escaped, joined the troops, and disclaimed the capitulation entered into by Major Wood, was certain. To have surprised and carried off Douglas could not be much worse. We now consulted with Witt, to whom we communicated our suspicions, at the same time disclosing the true name of our young commander, and his relation to Col. Trevor. What was suspicion with us, was at once absolute certainty with him. I do not think I ever witnessed such a change as our communication made in the whole appearance and demeanor of the man. Heretofore, I had always seen him cool, cautious, deliberate, and thoughtful. There was, besides, a prevailing tone of benevolence in all he said, which, added to his sobriety and strong sense, gave him some claim to the title of philosopher. But now the expression of his countenance was terrible and awful. He had made no show of regard for Douglas; but his attachment was deep and abiding, and his alarm for his safety was in the same degree. He was impatient of a moment's delay, sternly protested against wasting time in discussion, and insisted on immediately storming the camp. Schwartz was nothing behind him in zeal, though less disturbed by passion; and we presently determined to bring matters to extremities. As soon, therefore, as the hour appointed for surrender arrived, our captive drummer was ordered to beat a parley. To this the only answer was a general fire of musketry from the whole line of the camp on that side, by which a few men were hurt. But the distance was too great for any serious mischief. Enough, however, was done to excite the men to fury; and without waiting for the word, they rushed to the assault. Their movement determined me. To rush up to the piqueted entrenchment, behind which the enemy were in comparative safety, was to expose themselves to destruction. It was indispensable to open a way for them. This I effected by a discharge of both pieces of artillery, which tore the gate away, and pointed their attack to this accessible point. The moment after, Colonel Trevor, with his untractable rashness, appeared in the gateway, shouting, and calling to his men to sally forth against us. He was instantly recognized by the incensed Witt, whose fatal aim brought him 15 † to the ground. His men fell back; and in a moment after, a white flag was raised. It was no easy matter to prevail on our men to pay any regard to this signal; but we succeeded in restraining them before it was too late. Of course we demanded the instant surrender of the place, which was unhesitatingly given up. Major Wood now came forward to apologize and explain. Col. Trevor, having made his escape, had returned to the camp soon after tattoo. His whole behavior was that of a man beside himself, and actuated by some inscrutable motive to some inscrutable purpose. Of these he said nothing to his officers, but peremptorily disclaiming the capitulation, gave orders that all things should be prepared for a renewal of hostilities the next morning. Nothing more was known but that he had summoned to his quarters a favorite sergeant of his own regiment, who had been left sick in camp when he marched against Douglas. This sergeant and four soldiers, as it seemed from the morning report, had disappeared in the night. Major Wood assured us, that all that had been since done had taken place under the immediate orders and superintendence of Colonel Trevor, and in spite of his own most earnest remonstrances. In proof of his sincerity, he appealed to the fact of his unconditional surrender the moment he was apprised of the fall of the Colonel. With all this I was perfectly satisfied, and gladly returned him his sword, with a proper acknowledgment of his gentlemanly conduct. “And now, Major,” said Schwartz, “there is another matter we want to talk to you about. Do you know any thing of our Captain?” “Of Captain Douglas?” said the Major. “Certainly not. But I hope I may now have the pleasure of seeing him.” “Look here, Major,” said Witt, whose eye still glared with ferocity not at all abated by the fall of Trevor; “that a'nt the thing; and we want a straight answer. Captain Douglas is missing, and we want to know what's become of him.” “Missing!” said the Major, with unfeigned amazement. “I assure you, upon my honor, I know nothing of him.” “Is there any body here that knows, or is like to know?” said Schwartz. “None that I can imagine,” was the reply. “Is there not a Captain here,” asked Schwartz; “a red-headed fellow, that commands the company at Farmville?” “Captain Cottle? Yes.” “Well, I want to see him.” He was immediately summoned, and presently made his reluctant appearance. His alarm increased on seeing Schwartz and Witt. “See here, Mister,” said the former; “here is a piece of villany that we want to know about; and there is nobody, I reckon, so apt to tell us as you.” “Indeed, sir,” said Cottle, “I declare, sir, I don't know a word about it.” “You don't, eh!” said Schwartz. “Well, any how, you are mighty quick to find out that you don't know; that I must say for you.” “Did you ever see me before?” said Witt, fixing his terrible eye on the alarmed Captain. “Did you ever see me before?” repeated he. “Do you remember where it was? Do you remember your business there; and did you ever hear of such a thing as a man being hung for a spy?” The collapse of deadly terror came over Cottle at these dreadful words. His face, already pale, became livid; his eye no longer blenched under the fearful glance of Witt; but the lids opened as if by mutual repulsion, while his lip and under jaw fell powerless. He was roused from this state by Schwartz, who asked him what had become of Captain Douglas. He was now effectually scared out of all thought of concealment, and answered without prevarication that Captain Douglas had been surprised, during the night, by the order of Col. Trevor, and sent away immediately under the guard of a sergeant and four men, across the river. He could not say, certainly, where he was gone; but he suspected to Wasington, as Col. Trevor appeared to have been writing busily all the time the party were engaged in the capture of Douglas. It was vain to attempt concealing that he had a hand in this, though the disclosure was made with great reluctance. It appeared, moreover, that he had been anxious to accompany the prisoner, supposing him to be ordered for Washington; but Col. Trevor had refused to send him. Indeed, he sent none but those who had not been engaged in the action at the ford, and was certainly right not to trust the vain babbler, whose idle garrulity could hardly have failed to rub off any gloss he might have thought fit to spread over the affair. “How did they get across the river?” asked Schwartz. “We have a strong guard on the other side, and they had orders to keep a strict watch.” “Col. Trevor told the sergeant,” replied Cottle, “just to float quietly down the river and land away below; and a handkerchief was tied over the Captain's mouth to keep him from making a noise, and if he did, they were ordered to shoot him.” I have no words to express the horror with which I heard this last circumstance. I trusted, and indeed Major Wood seemed to be of that opinion, that Col. Trevor had really been beside himself; but regarding his conduct even as the effect of frenzy, it was hardly less shocking. From Schwartz the communication only called forth some pithy expressions of detestation, without seeming to interrupt the working of his thoughts, which were at once busy to devise some remedy for the evil. Witt was differently affected. His whole frame and countenance assumed an appearance of stony rigidity, betokening fixed and fearful purpose. He turned his glaring eye to the spot where Col. Trevor had fallen, with an expression that showed his vengeance quite unsatisfied. A glance of fierce scorn fell for a moment on Cottle; and then, with a searching look, he addressed himself to Major Wood. “Major Wood,” said he, with a voice whose deep, stern tones, demanded the truth and the whole truth, “did you know any thing of this business?” “Upon my honor, I did not; and Captain Cottle, who did know, will tell you so.” “I would hardly take his word against himself,” said Witt, with cold contempt, and not even turning his eye on Cottle. Then pausing a moment, he added, with the same look of severe scrutiny, “Major Wood, do you know who Captain Douglas is? Do you know that he is Col. Trevor's own brother?” “Great God!” exclaimed the Major. “Douglas Trevor! That fine, intelligent, accomplished, noble young man!—” “Did you know him?” asked the other. “I did,” said Wood, “and loved him well. Poor fellow! Poor fellow! His doom is sealed.” “That's enough,” said Witt. “I see now that you had no hand in it. But is it not your duty, Major Wood, to bring back Captain Douglas and set him at liberty?” “Would to God that I could,” said the Major; “but he is quite beyond my reach before this.” “See here, Major,” said Schwartz; “write an order to that sergeant to bring him back, and give me a pass to follow him without being stopped, and I will have him back in no time. Them fellows lost ground here crossing the river, and I can catch them.” “That might do,” said the Major, hesitatingly; “and I am bound in honor to do it, because his capture was a breach of my truce. But I shall never be forgiven. No matter; it shall be done if they break me for it.” “You may thank the Major,” said Witt, turning his implacable eye on Cottle, “for that word; for it has given you a chance for your life. But for that, you would have been hanging like a dog in half an hour. Now, Major, I don't want you to come to any harm; and so you shall have a fair excuse. Bring Captain Douglas back to us, and we will let this fellow go. But if the Captain is not here before the week is out, then, as sure as there is a God in Heaven, he shall be hanged for a spy, as he is.” There is a difference between the certainty of being hanged in half an hour, and a chance of escape, however unpromising. To Captain Cottle, who had not ventured nearer to Jones's Ford than the rear of the dragoons, and who was now in greater peril than he had ever willingly encountered, the difference was of great importance. Yet his hopes were faint, for he had heard the orders of Trevor, which enjoined despatch; and he was equally earnest in hurrying the Major and Schwartz. His impertinence was cut short by ordering him to close custody in jail; and the credentials of Schwartz being soon prepared, he set out on his journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">16 † CHAPTER XL. That lies like truth, and yet most truly lies. Let us again intrude into the sanctuary of majesty. The President is alone, as before. He has the same air of somewhat impatient expectation. A shade of anxious thought is on his brow, and his cheek is flushed with some little excitement. Yet these elements are all so mixed as to be scarcely perceptible; and were he conscious that we are looking at him, they would be completely concealed. On the table lie a number of letters recently received. Two of them are separated from the rest. He takes up one and reads it a second time. Let us look over him. It runs thus: “The wisest may be deceived; the most vigilant may be betrayed: for the MOST trusted are often the most treacherous. Caution.” “What means this?” said the President, musingly. “Who is it that I am warned against? The word `MOST' is underscored. Who does that point at? Whom do I trust most? I trust nobody. But I seem to trust; and whom most? Surely, it cannot be he. I should, indeed, be wrong to trust to his fidelity. But he is too wise to be false to his own interest. But may he not have an interest that I am not aware of? It must be considered.” He then took up the other letter, which I beg leave to lay before the reader, as a specimen of the art with which the truth may be so told as to make others believe what is false. I recommend it particularly to military gentlemen, reporting the results of a battle. Head Quarters, Camp near Lynchburg, November, 12, 1849. Sir: I have the honor to lay before your Excellency an account of the operations of the troops under my command, since the date of my last despatch. In pursuance of the information I had received, of which your Excellency has been already advised, I marched on the third inst., at the head of my own regiment, one battalion of the 15th, a company of artillery, and one of dragoons, to meet Douglas on his descent from the mountains. At Jones's Ford, on Staunton river, I encountered him, when about half his force had crossed over. I attacked him immediately; and, after a sharp conflict, drove him across the river. By the advice of Col. Mason, I left the artillery and draggons on the north bank, to protect our rear, placing them under the command of that distinguished officer. Pressing hard upon the rear of the enemy, we came up with him just as he had fallen back on the reserve. Here he rallied, and the fight was renewed. I regret to say that, at the first fire, my horse fell under me, imprisoning my leg by his fall. At the same moment a ball struck my head, and I came to the ground insensible. You will judge my astonishment, when, on recovering my senses, I found that all my men near me had thrown down their arms, and that I was in the hands of the enemy, who assisted me to rise. I immediately called to my men to resume their arms; but am sorry to inform you that I was not obeyed. As I had not surrendered, I was seized and hurried away to the house of a ring-leader of these rebels, where I was confined. From that time I had no means of receiving any information on which I could rely concerning the events of the day, as I had no intercourse with any but the rebels. Two days ago I was so fortunate as to make my escape. Returning to this place, I find my camp, which had been left under the command of Major Wood, beleaguered by the rebels, and a treaty for surrender in full progress. I rejoice that I have returned in time to prevent a consummation so disgraceful. It is now midnight, and a small party has been sent out to endeavor to surprise the leader of this banditti. In the meantime all things are put in readiness for a sortie in the morning. I shall not close my letter until I can give some farther account of the success of these operations. Two o'clock, A. M.—My scouts have come in, and brought in the hostile chief, who proves to be the last man in the world whom I could have wished to find in arms against the generous master who so well deserved his grateful devotion. I speak of that unfortunate youth, whose fault, (I must not use a harsher term,) nearly twelve months ago, dishonored our common name and parentage. Your Excellency will appreciate the struggle in my bosom, between a sense of duty and the foolish but inextinguishable relentings of nature. I have determined to put an end to this painful strife, and to take security against my own weakness, by sending him on immediately to you, without awaiting the result of the meditated sortie in the morning. He therefore travels in custody of the bearer of this letter, under guard of a sergeant and four men. Having returned to the camp this night, after tattoo, I am unprepared to give any account of our loss, or that of the enemy. I have nothing authentic but the lamented death of Col. Mason, who fell fighting bravely. I beg leave to express an humble hope, that your Excellency will be pleased to attribute the partial failure of my enterprise to the unfortunate wound which put me hors du combat, at a moment, up to which we had successfully driven the enemy before us for nearly half a mile and across the river. I remain, sir, with the most profound respect, your Excellency's most humble and faithful servant, Owen Trevor, Col. 18th Inf. “A worthy gentleman,” said the President, folding up the letter. “A most worthy gentleman! Let any man doubt henceforth, if he can, that the only way to judge in advance of what a man will do, is to ascertain his interest. See how readily it settled this nice point of casuistry—this delicate question of conflicting duties. Trust! Yes, I will trust; but not as fools do. I will trust no man's honor, but every man's interest. The experience of my whole life has taught the lesson, and every day confirms it. Here comes a new example,” added he, as the doorbell sounded, and was echoed by the single stroke in the room. The door opened, and the honorable Mr. Baker appeared. His figure had lost nothing of its deferential bend; his step nothing of its creeping, cautious tread; his countenance nothing of its abject servility. But there was more of anxiety and less of hope, with a slight appearance of peevish dissatisfaction. “You are very good, my dear sir,” said the President. “You are always almost present to my 16 † wish. Government would be an easy task, were all officers like you.” “I humbly thank your Excellency,” replied the Judge. “Were not your approbation precious to me, I might be tempted perhaps to look more than I ought to public opinion. Perhaps I do so, as it is; for though my duties are clearly necessary to the good of the State, I find it hard to bear the loud reproaches of a misjudging multitude, that reach me through a factious press.” “Let it not reach you, my dear sir. The storm does but rage without. Why need you hear it when it touches you not. Shut your ears and sleep soundly; or open them only to the more pleasant tones that issue from loyal lips. I take care not to know what is said of me by malcontent scribblers; but I hardly flatter myself that I should preserve my equanimity, if I read all that is written.” “It is sometimes impossible not to hear,” said the Judge; “and there are words which convey reproach, which, though uttered in a single breath, reach the heart. I can never, I fear, make myself proof against such a phrase as `judicial murder.' ” “But you must find consolation in your own enlightened conscience, my dear sir. Some feeling must be expected when the edge of the law falls on victims whose offences demand punishment, and yet are such as those the world calls honorable and upright are most likely to commit.” “The misfortune is,” replied the other, “that it is only for such offences, and on such victims, that my office seems to be made to act; and when the curse rises up against me, loud as well as deep, and uttered and echoed on every side, I pray your Excellency to pardon me, when I say, that I find its honors and emoluments a poor compensation.” “It will be some relief to you, then,” replied the President, “that you are like to have a subject of a different sort to act upon. One whose crimes offend against the laws of God as well as man; and who is not more obnoxious to State policy, than to the detestation of all good men, and of none more than yourself.” “Of whom is your Excellency pleased to speak?” asked Mr. Baker. “Of no other than that young fellow, Trevor, whose ill luck snatched him away from our hands, when perhaps he was not quite ripe for punishment. But he has since made himself perfect in crime, by becoming the leader of a desperate benditti. In short, he is no other than the famous Captain Douglas, and is now in my power. I think you will find in his case a fair set-off against some of the mortifications of which you complain; and think no more of denying your services to the public, at least until he has fulfilled his destiny.” The effect of this communication on the mind of the honorable gentleman, was such as the President had anticipated. To every being of the name of Trevor he bore a mortal antipathy. In the case of Douglas, this was rendered more intense by the sympathy of a father with a favorite son. An envious malignity was a striking feature in the characters both of father and son; and this had been provoked to the utmost by that unfortunate young man. Both were sensible that the younger Baker had been in bad odor with the public, ever since the affair at the falls; and hence, it was not only grateful to their malice, but to their pride, to fasten on Douglas a stigma so dishonorable as to have relation back, and to excuse his adversary with those who did not know all the circumstances, for not seeking such redress as gentlemen demand of gentlemen only. The good humor of the Judge was now manifestly restored, and the President went on to give him some particulars of the late military occurrences. Douglas, he said, was on the road, and would reach Washington the next day. The letter, it seems, had been brought by a soldier who had orders to outgo the rest of the party, and ride express to Washington. “It is well,” said the President, “that I have this timely intimation of his approach. The custody of State prisoners cannot be safely entrusted to any but the military; and that of this young man must be committed to no corps in which he had any acquaintance. It seems that he was a universal favorite among men and officers. I am about to take measures to guard against any such blunder.” In such conversation half an hour was past, when the Minister made his appearance. He had been sent for, and to him the President communicated the history of the capture of Douglas. Had he turned an eye of close scrutiny on the favorite, at the moment when he uttered the name, and announced the fate of his victim, he might have seen a slight expression of countenance, which it would not have been easy to interpret. But this escaped him; and he went on to direct that the true name of the prisoner should be kept secret; that his arrival should be watched for; and that he should be at once conducted to a place provided for the separate confinement of State prisoners. It was, moreover, ordered, that a detail of officers and men for that prison should be carefully made, so as to exclude any persons whose loyalty was at all doubtful; and especially all who, from former associations, could be supposed to feel any kindness for Douglas. Finally, it was agreed that, should he arrive in the course of that night, or the next day, he should be brought, on the following night, before the triumvirate, in the room where they then were. “You were right,” continued the President, addressing his Minister, “when you said that this young man had talent. The discovery of his identity explains the marvellous organization and efficiency of that wild banditti that he commanded. His capture must be fatal to their future success. They must be powerless now that they have lost their leader, and must soon disband. That is well. The two regiments may now be marched from Lynchburg to Richmond, and save us the necessity of sending a reinforcement from this quarter. The troops there, with this aid, will certainly be sufficient to cheek the insurrectionary movements that we hear of in the southern counties, and to cover the meeting of the Legislature. Col. Trevor has certainly deserved well. I am afraid his unfortunate wound may have occasioned the loss of more men than we could well spare, who seem to have surrendered while he was insensible. But the disbanding of Douglas's corps will, of course, set them at liberty to return to their duty. But this takes nothing from Col. Trevor's merit. He must be brevetted. As to Major Wood, in the regular course he should succeed Mason; but I must hear more of this negotiation for a surrender of his post, before he is promoted. That affair must be satisfactorily explained, or he will hardly escape a court-martial.” The President now went on to give some farther orders, and then dismissed his guests.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER LXI. Treason can never take a form so hideous, But it will find a glass, that shall reflect A comely semblance, on which self may look With a complacent smile. On his departure from Lynchburg, Schwartz had been provided with a suit of clothes half military, to prevent the notice which his rude mountain attire would have attracted. The day was half spent before he was on the road, and the sergeant and his party were already far in advance of him. Colonel Trevor had been desirous, for obvious reasons, that his letter and prisoner should reach Washington as soon as possible, and had ordered the party to proceed with all practicable despatch. But, as they might be somewhat retarded by the necessary care of their prisoner, he had directed that the letter should be sent on, as we have seen, by a single soldier, who had reached Washington on the second night. But the sergeant was not far behind, and had used such diligence that he crossed the bridge the next morning at an early hour, just as poor Schwartz came in sight. He recognized the party by the peculiar dress of Douglas, with which he was so familiar; but it was too late. He followed, however, disconcerted by his failure, but not desponding. At the farther end of the bridge he was struck with the countenance and manner of a fine looking young man, of genteel but plain appearance, who stood gazing earnestly after the prisoner and his guard. Observing Schwartz, he asked eagerly who the prisoner was, and was told it was Captain Douglas. “Good God!” exclaimed he, in a tone of deep concern; “is it possible? But thank God! it is no worse.” “Did you think it was any body you knew?” asked the quick-witted Schwartz. “Yes,” replied the other. “I was almost sure it was a friend of my own.” “And what was your friend's name, stranger? if I may be so bold.” “You are bold enough,” said the youth. “I am not in the habit of answering questions, unless I know who asks them, and why.” “I don't mean no harm, young man,” replied Schwartz; “and if you tell me your friend's name and your own too, may be you won't be sorry for it.” The stranger looked hard at Schwartz, and in his serious, earnest, and sagacious countenance saw enough to make him curious to know what this meant. He therefore replied, that his friend was Lieutenant Trevor, late of the United States Dragoons. “Then I have a notion,” replied Schwartz, “that your name is Whiting.” “My name is Whiting,” replied the other, in great surprise; “but how should you know it?” “I have heard the Captain talk about you many a time.” “The Captain! What Captain?” “Him,” replied Schwartz, pointing toward the distant party. “Him! And how was he to know any thing about me?” “Just because he is the very man you thought he was.” “Douglas!” exclaimed Whiting. “Trevor! Douglas Trevor! Good God, what an ass I have been! O Trevor, my friend! how earnestly have I wished to know where to find you! Had I been with you, this might have been prevented.” “May be it is best as it is,” said Schwartz. “The Captain did not want for friends where he was. May be one friend here will do him more good than a hundred any where else. That is what I am here for now.” “You are a friend to Trevor, then,” replied Whiting; “perhaps one of his followers.” “You may say that,” said Schwartz. “Any how, I'm his friend.” “Then come with me to my lodgings. You can tell me every thing, and we will see what is to be 17 † done. Trevor has friends enough here. Thank God! I saw him. But for that we might not have found out who he was till it was too late.” Whiting now showed Schwartz where to bestow his horse, and afterwards conducted him to his lodgings. These were in an obscure suburb, humble, plain, and poorly fitted up. Appearances showed that the occupant spent most of his time with the pen, although many of the relics of his former military equipments were to be seen about the room. But the dust on his cap, which hung against the wall, and the mould on the belt and scabbard of his sword, showed that these had been long unused. In truth, the escape of Douglas and his uncle had been fatal to him as a soldier. He had been dismissed the army; and now, as it seemed, earned a poor livelihood by doing for small wages the manual labor of those offices, the salaries of which are received by men who do nothing at all. During their long walk through the streets of that city “so magnificent in distances,” as Monsieur Serrurier said of it, and while a hasty breakfast was preparing for Schwartz, he gave Whiting the particulars of the late battle at Jones's Ford; of Douglas's capture, and of his brother's death, and the surrender of the camp. As soon as he had seen his guest provided for, the young man left him alone. Going out, he proceeded to the first stand of coaches, and stepping into one was driven to the Minister's. Here he alighted, showed a ticket to the porter, entered, threaded several passages, descended a dark stair, and, going into a small room in the basement, touched the spring of a bell. No answering sound was heard; but, in half an hour the Minister appeared. “I am glad to see you,” said he. “Have you heard that your friend Trevor is in the power of his enemies, and is expected here to-day?” “I had not heard it,” said Whiting; “but I have seen him. He is here.” “Indeed! That is well. We have the more time.” “Where will he be lodged, and under what custody?” “In the state prison. I am instructed to select his guards from among those who are strangers to his person, and well-affected to the Government.” “That will be no easy task, as it seems that all the troops of that description have been marched into Virginia, and that, except raw recruits, there are none here that it was thought safe to trust on that service.” “That is true,” said the Minister; “and therefore I must select those same raw recruits. Think you there are many here who could be relied on to peril every thing on behalf of your friend?” “No doubt of it. I was long enough in the army after his disgrace to know that his whole regiment were indignant at it. A hundred can be found ready to wipe it out with the blood of the President, or their own.” “It is well. He will be taken to the palace this night, under the cloud of darkness. Have all things in readiness, and watch for his return. You will know what to do. Did you know those who had him in custody?” “I knew the sergeant, and he knew me.” “All right. You then must be charged with the disappearance of Douglas; you must therefore make your escape with him. I shall, of course, see you no more. We have no time for compliment; but you will have my best wishes; and the time may come when you may have it in your power to do me justice. My country is to me, Mr. Whiting, what yours is to you. When New England was permitted to join in what you will call the plunder of the South, I was not very scrupulous about the means of securing her share. But nearly all that was worth having is irretrievably lost. What remains can only be retained by means which will but make it an instrument of power in the hands of this man, and so enable him to perpetuate his reign according to the forms of the constitution. Take that away, and leave the matter altogether to the votes of the northern States, and I shall not long have to play second to him. In order to preserve his power, he would be compelled to break up the system of monopoly contrived for the exclusive benefit of his favorite Empire State; or perhaps to concur with me in severing a Union, the benefits of which are now lost, by the escape of our common prey, and of which we bear all the inconveniences. Of course, I do not pretend that the place to which the favor of my countrymen may advance me in either event, has no charms for me. But you will see that I am actuated by no low and sordid ambition. I am desirous you should see it in this light. It is not my fortune to command the services of many whose esteem is eminently desirable. I am, therefore, the more ambitious of yours. Should I succeed, my acts will vindicate my motives. Should I fail, (and if Virginia disenthrals herself I shall not fail,) you will do me this justice. What news have you of the movements of B—?” “He is about to take up arms, with the probability of assembling a force which, with the concurrence of the corps of Douglas, will secure his object.” “But is not the band of Douglas dispersed?” “By no means; but much increased. They have still their mountain leaders, and a young man from the South Carolina military school, who seems well qualified to act, for the time, as the locum tenens of the Chief.” “Then farewell, sir,” said the Minister. “You carry with you my good wishes for yourself and your cause, and I pray you to commend them to Mr. B—.” 17 † About the time that these gentlemen thus separated, the President was informed that a gentleman and lady craved the favor of a private audience. He directed that they should be shown into the room, the privacy of which we have so often violated, and soon after he entered it. A lady, whose figure and dress denoted youth, was seated on the sofa. She was in deep mourning, and a black veil completely hid her face. By her side sat a gentleman far advanced in life, and of a most venerable aspect. His fair complexion had blanched by time into the cold dead whiteness of age. The color had, in like manner, faded from his pale blue eye; and the quivering of his livid lip, and the trembling of his eyelids, betokened deep and anxious distress. His dress also was of black, mournfully contrasting with the almost unearthly whiteness of his face. At the entrance of the President both rose; and the trembling and agitated old gentleman might be seen to give way for a moment, as if about to throw himself on his knees before “the dreaded prince whose will was fate.” But he recovered himself, and with an air of suppliant dignity, stood as erect as the weakness and infirmity of age permitted. The President approached him with a look of perplexity and doubt; and, gazing earnestly at him, said: “I beg to know, sir, who it is. Bless me! Mr. Trevor, is it possible that I see you here, at this moment?” “I am here, sir,” replied the old gentleman, “a broken-hearted, bereaved father, lamenting the loss of one son, and suppliant for the life of another; and this is my niece, who is come to join her prayers to mine, on behalf of her betrothed husband.” There was enough in these words to add to the maiden confusion of poor Delia, but not enough to prevent her from lifting a timid glance, in which there was as much of entreaty as her proud spirit could descend to. She met the eye of the President, as with an air of quick and eager surprise he turned towards her; and in his eye she read a meaning, which, in the moment, blasted her hopes and confirmed her in all her detestation of the cold, selfish, and crafty politician, whom she now beheld for the first time. She saw, instantly, that she was the object of some subtle purpose; and felt, that by putting herself in his power, she had but prepared for her husband a deeper distress than all the severities of the law could inflict. But she quailed not at the thought. Her proud and bold spirit came in aid of her weakness; her pale cheek burnt with an indignant glow, and the tears were dissipated from her eyes in the bright and almost fierce glance that flashed from them. Even through her veil too much of this appeared to escape the notice of the President. He instantly turned away; and, with an air and tone of the most candied courtesy, addressed Mr. Trevor: “You speak in riddles, my dear sir,” said he; “I beg you to explain.” “My task is more painful than I had anticipated,” said the poor old man. “Have I, then, to be the herald of my poor Owen's death, and of the yet more disastrous fate of my other noble boy?” “Col. Trevor dead, sir!” exclaimed the President. “Impossible! I have just received a letter from him, written on the 12th.” “That day was the last of his life,” said the afflicted father. “He fell next morning. I received the news yesterday by the railroad; and by travelling all night by the same conveyance, I am here to entreat that the axe may not glean what the sword has left me. My poor boy Douglas, I am told, is in your power, and perhaps here.” “I had heard of this; but I assure you your son is not here. I will not deny that I expect him; and regret that it is under circumstances which will not allow me the pleasure of extending to him the same courtesy I shall be happy to render to you. Compose yourself, my dear sir; let me beg you and your niece to retire to rooms which are always ready to receive you where I am master; and let me send for your baggage.” Delia, who thought there was something of hesitancy in her uncle's mind, instantly exclaimed: “No, my uncle! No, my father! The palace of a tyrant is a prison. There is no mercy here. No hope for my noble husband. Save yourself. Return home while you may, and leave me here to share his fate. Our friends may rescue us. They WILL avenge us. But in that cold eye there is no relenting.” “You are harsh, lady,” said the President; “I will not add, unjust. I will prove that, by permitting your instant departure, without even enquiring where you lodge.” He now bowed them out, and immediately summoning a servant, said: “Take the number of that coach, and let the driver attend me this evening.” Then, as the servant left the room, he went on: “Why, this is better and better. I think I have holds enough now on Baker to bind him to his task, however his heart may yearn after his beggarly estate in Virginia. It seems, forsooth, that after all that has passed, his son yet has a hankering after this girl; the only woman, as he says, that he ever truly loved. It may be but spite against his favored rival; or it may be, in truth, that every thing that bears the shape of man is susceptible of love, or what passes for it. Be it so. He may be gratified; but his father shall fulfil conditions.” In the evening of the same day the following letter was put into the hands of the President: “Your captive has arrived. Beware how you remand him to his prison, when you dismiss him to-night. Order him to be confined within the palace; and when you give the order, mark well its effect on him you most trust. Caution.” “Why, here is proof as well as accusation,” said the President. “Here is treason. How else is it known that Trevor was to be brought here to-night? I will improve this hint. A rescue is to be attempted! Is that it? Then the guard will be attacked on their return without the prisoner. Wo to the traitor if it prove so!” I have been interrupted in my narrative. I have hesitated whether to give this fragment to the public, until I have leisure to complete my history. On farther reflection, I have determined to do so. Let it go forth as the first Bulletin of that gallant contest, in which Virginia achieved her independence; lifted the soiled banner of her sovereignty from the dust, and once more vindicated her proud motto, which graces my title page,—SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! Amen. So mote it be. THE END.</field>
