      <field name="fulltext">O'HALLORAN; OR, The Insurgent Chief. CHAP. I. The moment came, the hour when Otho thought, Secure at last the vengeance which he sought. That morning he had freed the soil bound slaves, Who dig no lands for tyrants but their graves. Such is their cry; some watch-word for the fight, Must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right. Religion—freedom—vengeance—what you will— A word's enough to raise mankind to kill. Byron. It was on the evening of the fourth of June, that a messenger arrived from Belfast, at O'Halloran Castle. He delivered to its owner the following note, and passed on to circulate others of a similar import throughout the country. “Belfast, June 4th, 1798. “The signal is given. The mail coach has not arrived. Our informant says it was stopped yesterday at Swords. The south is in arms—Wexford is taken. Let the rising be on the 7th inst. The general rendezvous for this county is Donegore hill. The small parties of the military quartered in the country towns must be captured, if possible, by surprise. The bearer will proceed with intelligence along the coast. You will despatch messengers through the interior, by Ballynure, Ballyclare, Ballyeaston, Ballymena, &amp;c. Expedition is requisite. “HENRY M`CRACKEN. “To Henry O'Halloran, Esq. &amp;c.” O'Halloran immediately assembled his coadjutors, and couriers were soon despatched agreeably to the foregoing instructions. All was now preparation, bustle, and eagerness, among the populace of Larne; but every one was unusually sober, and good humoured. Not a drunken man was to be seen, nor even a woman heard to scold, during this awful period of secrecy, suspense, and anxious activity. Even the military were treated with more than usual complaisance, and all men were not only quiet, but apparently contented and happy. Thus in a profound calm were the populace of this district employed in collecting all the elements of irritation, hatred, and ferocity, which were soon to burst into the most dreadful storm of destruction that ever swept that unhappy country. The sixth of June, the eve of the insurrection, came. Mirth seemed to engage the young; friendship, good humour, and hilarity, the middle aged; while the old looked on in portentous silence and meditation. All business, every species of labour, spontaneously ceased after mid-day. The merchant, indeed, still kept his shop open, but it was only to lean over his counter; for he neither desired, nor obtained customers. The mechanic also kept his work-shop open, but in it there was no sound of hammer, nor saw, nor axe, nor shuttle to be heard. Spades, mattocks, and hoes were thrown aside, or disappeared as if they had in reality been converted into swords and spears. Towards the evening, an increased degree of mirth and jollity pervaded the younger part of the community; while even the more sedate and advanced in life, relaxed, or, growing weary of A 2 their thoughtfulness or their idleness, joined in athletic sports, such as wrestling, running, leaping, hurling, and various other kinds of rural pastimes. Such an unsual degree of mirth and idleness among the people, excited the attention of the friends of government, and a vague whisper of some disturbance being intended during the night, reached the ears of the commander of the small party of military then quartered in Larne. This party consisted of about fifty of the Tay fencibles. Their captain's name was Small. In consequence of the rumour which had reached him, he thought proper strictly to enforce the general orders which had been several months before issued to the military dispersed over the country, to cause all persons in the disaffected towns and villages to keep within doors after 9 o'clock at night; but the execution of which, from the continued appearance of tranquillity in his neighbourhood, had been lately induced to relax. He therefore as soon as tattoo was beat, which for many months had been regularly done at 9 o'clock at night, paraded the streets with a patrole of twenty men, and compelled the people to relinquish their sports, and retire to their respective homes, under pain of being taken to the guard house. Men, women and children, all complied, and the streets, which a few minutes before displayed such a full scene of life, resounding with all the noise of rural mirth and manners, were now totally deserted, and as silent as the habitations of the dead. The soldiers had retired to their barrack, and a deep portentous calm continued for several hours. During this interval, a number of the most intrepid and zealous of the United Irishmen, stole cautiously to their appointed rendezvous, at a place called the Green Holme, about a half a mile from the town. It was a solitary spot, at the foot of a high hill, a short distance from the public road, from which it was screened by two intervening thick hedges, and was selected for their meeting, not more on account of its privacy and contiguity to the town, than on account of a cold, clear and beautiful spring of water it contained. Here O'Halloran and M`Cauley arranged the plan of an attack upon the barrack, the other leaders having gone off to head the insurrection in different parts of the country. It was about one o'clock in the morning, and every thing was quiet in the town, when O'Halloran, after having distributed among his little band, whiskey, and other refreshments, gave orders for proceeding to the attack. They were about eighty in number; about thirty of whom were armed with muskets, and the remainder with pikes. Their plan was two-fold.— If the soldiers were retired to sleep, which they presumed would be the case, but which they could easily ascertain by the show of resistance that would be made on their first appearance in the street that contained the barrack, they should proceed at once to the assault. But if their adversaries should be on the alert, they were to retreat so as to attract them in pursuit, while M`Cauley should hasten with a body of twenty men, twelve of whom had muskets, to form an ambuscade behind the wall of a rope factory, which joined one of the streets, and to which O'Halloran at the head of the main body, should direct his retreat, in order to bring his pursuers between two fires. The barrack was situated near the centre of a long street, on arriving at the upper end of which, the insurgents perceived that they must relinquish their first plan, as the garrison were evidently on the watch. Captain Small, who was a vigilant and active officer, had kept above a third of his troops under arms, for fear of a surprise, and had ordered the rest to sleep in their clothes, that they might be ready for action at a moment's warning. M`Cauley was now despatched to lay his ambush, and Darragh was ordered to pass through a by street, at the head of twenty men, to possess himself of the barrack, in case Small should leave it with his whole force in pursuit of O'Halloran. Having made these arrangements, and given the detachments time to execute them, which as it was considerably dark, and as they kept very silent, they accomplished without alarming their enemies, O'Halloran ordered his men to advance a few paces into the street containing the barrack, and, after discharging several muskets at the garrison, to retire immediately to the shelter of that adjoining. They fired. In a moment the royal drums beat “to arms,” and the troops to the number of forty—the remainder, in conjunction with some loyalists who had joined them on the preceding evening, being left to guard the barrack—formed in two lines, and, each taking one side of the street, marched at a quick pace towards the insurgents. But before their approach, O'Halloran had eluded their attack by removing to another street, at the end of which he stopped for a moment, to fire on the advancing troops, by which several of them were wounded. He then continued his retreat into the Rope-walk street, where M`Cauley lay concealed, and halting at the upper end of it, awaited the approach of his pursuers, who steadily advanced until they were within three hundred yards of him. Not a shot having been as yet fired in this street by either party, Small stopped, and exclaimed, “front division, ready! Now my lads, fire sure, and cut down the rebels!”—immediately a volley of musketry from behind, brought six of his own men to the ground. He turned round, but no enemy was visible. His van had fired at O'Halloran's party, two of whom were killed and several wounded. They immediately returned the fire, and two more of the soldiers pressed the ground. Small now gave orders for a retreat, when O'Halloran's pikemen rushed down upon him. But he checked them by his front presenting bayonets, and his rear division advancing and firing amongst them, and they were obliged, in their turn, to withdraw and seek shelter at their former stand. He had just ordered his opponents to be pursued, when another volley from his invisible assailants, brought down four more of his men. A retreat, at all hazards, was now necessary to save the remainder of his troops. It was, therefore, again attempted; but on coming opposite the rope-walk gate, M`Cauley, with the view of capturing Small, rushed with his little band of pikemen upon him; but they were too weak to make any impression, and a front of bayonets being instantly presented to them, they were compelled again to seek refuge behind their wall, though not until M`Cauley, with his own hands, had given Small a dreadful wound in the groin with a pike. As O'Halloran's men appeared coming to the aid of their companions, the troops did not think proper to pursue M`Cauley, but hastily passed on in their retreat to the end of the street, where they only halted to reload. They then continued their retreat, practising for their safety the same expedient that the insurgents had practised in drawing them into the ambush. On coming opposite a lane through which Darragh's small party were retiring, after having made an unsuccessful attempt on the barrack, they were fired on by this party, and two of their number killed. They returned the fire, but it did no execution; for Darragh's men, immediately on discharging their pieces, had taken refuge behind a low garden wall which formed one side of the lane. After this their progress to the barrack was unmolested. On arriving there, Captain Small found that he had left seventeen of his men in the hands of the Insurgents, and of those he had brought back, five, besides himself, were severely, and four slightly wounded. Thus one half of the soldiers who had gone out on this skirmish, were now unfit for duty. During the affair, only two of the insurgents were killed, and about seven or eight wounded.—So that, although they had failed in their object of reducing the barrack, they had obtained a considerable advantage; they had weakened and disheartened their enemies. Darragh's attempt on the barrack, had failed from the weakness of his party. He had, indeed, been directed to make no attempt, unless the whole strength of the troops should be drawn out in pursuit of O'Halloran. But, as from the number which appeared to be drawn out, he concluded that very few, indeed, could be left, he was induced to hazard an effort. Accordingly, he advanced boldly with his followers into the middle of the street, when he was assailed with such a firing as, although his men escaped uninjured, convinced him of his inability to succeed. He, therefore, withdrew, and was on his way by a circuitous route to join O'Halloran, when he encountered the retreating troops as before-mentioned, and added to their misfortunes. The inhabitants of the town, by this time, were flying in every direction, as their wishes or their fears prompted them, either to join that party to which they adhered, or to seek refuge in the country from that fate, to which many of them believed, that all who remained in the town would be doomed. During the skirmish they had, in terrible suspense, awaited the issue; those, especially of the popular party, who had relatives engaged in the affair, endured a dreadful agony of mind, not knowing but that every shot they heard was the death-knell of a husband, a brother, a son, or some other dear relative or friend. The shouts of the combatants, as either side gained the advantage—the groans of the wounded and the dying—the shrieks of the alarmed women and children, who, even from within their houses, louldly proclaimed their fears, formed a scene terribly painful to the imaginations of all, but such, if there be such monsters, as delight in human misery. Notwithstanding his success, O'Halloran did not think it prudent, immediately, to renew the attack on the garrison. His strength was every minute increasing, and he expected in a few hours, to be able to overwhelm all opposition. The distance to Donegore hill, the appointed rendezvous for the county, where the great stand was to be made, and where it was his duty to be with his followers, at four o'clock that afternoon, was only about fourteen miles. He had, consequently, sufficient time to wait for such an accession of strength, before he renewed his attack on the troops, as would render resistance hopeless, and, perhaps, lead to a surrender of the place without bloodshed. To these suggestions he yielded as much from humanity as policy. In the meantime, he was not inactive. Small parties were despatched in every direction to arouse their friends, and intimidate even their enemies, to come to their assistance. Multitudes came voluntarily; but it must be confessed, that numbers whose fears or principles rendered them reluctant, were compelled to take the field with the pike at their breasts. These recruiting and impressing parties, were ordered to be again on the ground by eight o'clock, A. M. at which time it was intended to make a grand assault on the barrack. In the meantime, every avenue to and from the place was strictly guarded, so that none of the loyalists in the country could join the garrison, nor any of those in the town carry intelligence from it. The garrison, however, notwithstanding their disaster, had been joined by nearly a hundred of the town's people who were attached to the government, and many more would have flocked to their aid, had they not been forced either to conceal themselves, or to fall into the ranks of the Insurgents.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. II. Sir, you may counsel though you are our foe, Because you are an honourable man; We'll hearken to you, and those friends of yours, Whom we have vanquished, may have terms of truce, If they will take them of our framing, for 'Tis not our wish that human blood should flow For useless purpose. So haste on the treaty. The Irish Soothsayer. O'Halloran was afraid that before he should have numbers sufficient to overcome the garrison, after it became strengthened by the loyalists of the town, as has been just mentioned, a detachment of the army which lay in considerable force at Carrickfergus, only nine miles distant, might come to its relief. He, therefore, took the precaution to station scouts on horseback on the roads leading to and from that place, so that he might have the speediest intelligence of any such detachment, and be enabled to meet it on suitable ground. When the time fixed for assaulting the garrison arrived, he found his party about twelve hundred strong. Not more than three hundred of them, however, had fire arms, the rest being armed in the most miscellaneous, and some of them in the most unserviceable, manner. About four hundred had tolerably good pikes, the handles of which varied from ten to fifteen feet long, and consequently in close combat, possessed a great advantage over the guns and bayonets of the king's troops; and were expected by the projectors of the insurrection, to be capable of doing so much execution, as almost to atone for their deficiency B in fire arms and ammunition. The remainder were armed, some with common hay forks, some with scythes fixed on the ends of poles, and many with dung-forks, spades, or other implements of rural industry. O'Halloran having made the necessary dispositions for the attack, in order to animate the courage of his men, addressed them in the following words: “Irishmen! you have this day, with a glorious effort, thrown off a yoke which for centuries bound your ancestors to the feet of tyrants. A great task is yet to be performed, a mighty struggle is yet to be maintained, before you can convince your oppressors that they cannot replace you in your former degradation. You are now freemen. I congratulate you! But remember that it is only while you have arms in your hands, and your enemies are unable to wrest them from you, that you are so. Be united in sentiment, and firm in combat, and the latter will never be the case. Oppression will be driven out of the country, and your freedom will be established forever. You will then have your prosperity as a nation in your own hands. No foreign power, actuated by jealousy or fear of your growing greatness, will presume to set bounds to your external commerce, or to lay restrictions on your internal industry. “But why need I allude to the attempts of your late masters to keep you in poverty. Had they done you no other injury, you might have forgiven them. But have they not shackled the consciences of two-thirds of your countrymen? and do they not compel them, together with nine-tenths of the other third, to support an expensive and extravagant prelatic church establishment, which their consciences disapprove, and their feelings detest? Have they not driven thousands of your ancestors into exile; and have they not plundered and disinherited thousands more? As to yourselves, have they not of late years, heaped on you insult upon insult, injury upon injury, until your hearts have bled with agony? Have not your unoffending neighbours been dragged in hundreds from their fire sides, and treated as malefactors? They have been lodged in loathsome cells and dungeons; they have been scourged, and hanged, and shot, and gibbetted, without the common formality of law; without even the appearance of justice. But this was, perhaps, a more merciful mode of destruction; at least it was a more honest and courageous species of tyranny, than indictments before pensioned judges, and bribed and drunken juries. “But I need not recount your wrongs. Your hearts feel them, and rankle with them, and burn this day for vengeance. Ah! I see rage against your oppressors sparkle in your eyes, and fury is now the expression of your countenances. But let justice rather than rage direct your conduct; and be brave for freedom rather than vengeance. In aid of the multitudes of your compatriots, who are this day in arms for the same holy purpose, you will be strong, not so much, I trust, with a view to revenge, as to terminate your sufferings. Like men, we shall conquer our enemies; and, like christians, we shall forgive them: for it will be glorious to show them, that we can feel and practice towards them a virtue which they never felt, which they never practised towards us—the virtue of mercy. “This evening we must join our countrymen at the county encampment on Donegore, there to assist them in the glorious struggle. But we cannot leave our homes at the mercy of our enemies. We must capture those troops we have already defeated, if, in our absence, we wish our wives, our children, and our properties to be safe. Should we depart without taking this garrison with us, the look that we should give our habitations from yonder hill would be the last. We might return victors over our oppressors; but we should return to desolated streets and ruined walls. Be strong, my countrymen; consider the object for which you are to fight, your families and your homes. Remember the cause in which you are engaged is the sacred cause of your country. Fear nothing. Your quarrel is righteous; and God is on your side. Resolve, each man who hears me, resolve now to conquer or die. Let our war word be “Erin and Freedom!” He was answered by loud acclamations, and the sounds of “Erin and Freedom,” for several minutes continued to reverberate through the air. By dividing his men into two parties, one of which he entrusted to the command of M`Cauley, he made dispositions to attack the barracks in both front and rear at the same time. The standard of the United Irishmen was now hoisted. It displayed a gilded harp formed on a banner of green silk, surrounded with the mottoes of “Erin-go-bragh,” and “Liberty and Equality.” In martial music the insurgents at Larne were deficient; for they had only one drum and one fife; but these animated their spirits with the sounds of national airs, and they had just begun their march to the tune of “The Volunteer's Quick Step,” when an accession to their strength of nearly two hundred men arrived from one of the adjoining parishes, bringing with them as a prisoner, George M`Claverty, Esq. the magistrate, who, as the reader will recollect, examined Edward Barrymore so closely at the Antrim arms, when in pursuit of the murderers of M`Bride. O'Halloran halted his men, and they hailed the arrival of their confederates and their prisoner, with loud huzzas. On being informed of their design to attack the garrison, M`Claverty, who, although disliked among them on account of his political principles, was much respected for his other amiable qualities, attempted to dissuade them from it. “The capture of such a handful of men,” said he, “will tend nothing to the ultimate success of your cause, and forbearance may induce the government to forbearance with you on some similar occasion.” “Sir,” replied O'Halloran, “you are now our prisoner; as such we shall treat you as well as circumstances will permit; but we do not wish you to be our counsellor. We know your feelings towards us too well for that. In the meantime, I may inform you that we do not attack this garrison from any thirst of revenge or fondness for blood-shed, but, as we cannot remain here to protect our families and properties from their violence, we are resolved that where we go, they shall go also.” He then gave his men orders to proceed. But an incident at that moment occurred, which, by delaying their march for a space, gave M`Claverty another opportunity to interfere. A man of the name of Shaw, an inhabitant of the town, who had borne a captain's commission under George II. in his German wars, and had fought at the battle of Dettingen, and was an enthusiastic loyalist, excited to a temporary madness by the scenes he beheld, rushed out of his house, armed with a drawn sword, in spite of the entreaties and tears of his three daughters, into the midst of the insurgents; and with the most terrible imprecations on them as rebels, called on them to lay down their arms and disperse. A man whom he attacked was about thrusting a pike into his body, when M`Cauley rushed forward, and saved him. He was instantly disarmed, and delivered to his daughters, with strict injunctions to B 2 confine him, under a threat, that if he again molested them, his life should be taken. Struck with the humanity and magnanimity of this action, M`Claverty determined to make another effort to prevent the effusion of blood. “Summon the garrison,” cried he, “before you attack it. You are all my neighbours and friends, and this action makes me proud that you are so. I, therefore, earnestly entreat you to consult your own safety and welfare on this occasion, and avoid the useless destruction of human lives, even if they should be those of your enemies. Send a flag of truce to the garrison. Its commander will, perhaps, treat for its surrender, and human lives will be spared, while your interests will not be injured.” O'Halloran now consulted with the other officers of his small army, and gave it as his opinion, that M`Claverty's advice pointed out nothing more than their duty; and that policy as well as humanity required them to adopt it. They were all of the same opinion, except Darragh, who observed that, if they should now fight, they would be certain of victory; but if they negociated, they might be out-witted, and lose, by the deceit and cunning of their enemies, all the advantages they had gained by their own valour. “However,” said he, “if you are all agreed to this measure, I wont resist it: but in managing it, I beg you to keep your wits about you.” O'Halloran approached M`Claverty. “Sir,” said he, “We esteem you for the sentiments you have expressed; and shall take your advice. But first it is necessary, that we should apprize our enemies of our strength, in order to convince them that resistance is useless. They will believe your statement. Write to them an account of our number, our unanimity, and our enthusiasm; and exhort them to deliver themselves, and those loyalists who have taken refuge with them, together with all their warlike stores, into our hands; and we promise them, that not only the troops, but the refugees, shall be well treated, and their families and properties protected from injury.” “I shall make this statement,” said M`Claverty, “but I would not encourage you to expect that they will agree to such an unconditional surrender. However, I shall open the negociation, and ulterior arrangements may be afterwards discussed.” He accordingly wrote as follows: “I am now a prisoner in the hands of the insurgents; and you may be sure I am well treated, when I inform you that I have had influence enough to persuade them to postpone an attack, which, just as I was brought here, they were on the point of making upon you. “I know your gallantry would induce you to make a brave and persevering resistance; but their numbers, (they are now about sixteen hundred strong) and their enthusiasm, make them formidable, and would ensure them ultimate success, although, doubtless, at the expense of many lives. However, I will not assume the responsibility of advising you to an absolute surrender. Your duty forbids such an alternative, until resistance is proved beyond doubt, to be useless. But I entreat you to open a door for negociation. Something short of unconditional submission may probably be obtained. The cause of humanity will be consulted, and, perhaps, his majesty's interests also, by means of a treaty the terms of which it may be in your power honourably to accept. “I have just witnessed an instance of magnanimity which speaks much for the humane dispositions of those people; and renders them entitled to more indulgence, than, as rebels, they would otherwise deserve. “I have the honour to be, &amp;c. “GEORGE M`CLAVERTY. “To Captain James Small, “— company of Tay Fencibles.” This letter was accompanied by the following from the insurgent leaders. “To Captain Small. “Sir, we are to the number of sixteen hundred men in arms, prepared to attack the garrison under your command. But to give you an opportunity of saving your soldiers from destruction, we have thought proper, first, to apprize you of our intention, and to summon you in the name of our country, to surrender your party, both military and others, with all your warlike stores, into our hands. As our prisoners your lives will be safe, and as much attention as possible paid to your comforts. The lives, families and properties of such of our town's-men as have joined you, shall also remain unmolested. Our attack shall be suspended, in expectation of your compliance, for three quarters of an hour, but no longer. “We have the honour to be, “Your obedient humble servants. “HENRY O'HALLORAN, “JOHN M`CAULEY, “WILLIAM JOHNSTON, “Commanding the army of the United Irishmen in Larne.” In less than twenty minutes the following answer was received. “To George M`Claverty, Esq. “Sir, enclosed is my reply to the rebel chieftains. By it you will see that you anticipated truly, when you supposed that I would not agree to an unconditional surrender. I am sorry that you are in their power; but it is pleasing to find that they are not disposed to abuse their good fortune, by acts of wantonness or cruelty. It may yet be in my power to show that I can esteem humanity, even in such an enemy. “I have the honour to be, &amp;c. “JAMES SMALL, Capt. &amp;c.” The following was the reply received by the insurgents. “Gentlemen, “In answer to your message, I have to inform you that rather than comply with your demands, my party and myself are resolved to meet destruction amidst the ruins of the place, which it is our duty to defend. Do not, however, suppose that we shall fall an easy prey. It is true, your number exceed ours by ten to one; but were they a hundred to one, as we are fully supplied with the means of defence, we know too well how to use them, not to make our enemies deplore the dearness of any victory they may gain over us. In your case, it is apparent that victory is at least doubtful. Some traits of humanity displayed by you have been communicated to me, in consideration of which I give you my promise, and all the gentlemen of the town, who have so gallantly come to my assistance, will guarantee its performance, that if you lay down your arms, and return peaceably to your allegiance, all that you have yet done shall be overlooked, and pardoned, and the full and free protection of the laws of your country shall once more be extended towards you. Should you reject this offer, I can only deplore your infatuation; I must resist you unto destruction, and the blood of those who may fall on both sides, be upon your heads. “JAMES SMALL, Capt. &amp;c.” The insurgent officers now held another consultation, in which it was agreed to send a second message to the garrison, proposing to withdraw peaceably from the town, if Captain Small, and the loyalist gentlemen who were with him, would guarantee the safety of their families and properties after their departure. To these proposals Small replied that he would agree, provided, the insurgents would liberate George M`Claverty, Esq. Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, and a Mr. John Hill, together with the wounded soldiers they had captured. O'Halloran replied that he would, without reluctance, deliver up the wounded soldiers; but on no account would he part with the three gentlemen, except in exchange for an equal number of the United Irishmen then imprisoned in Carrickfergus, and for whose safety he would keep these prisoners as hostages. “Tell Captain Small,” said he to the messenger, “that this is our last proposal. If it is not acceded to in twenty minutes, the barrack shall be attacked in front and rear; and for whatever blood shall be shed, let him be accountable.” Small held a short consultation with the gentlemen of the town who had joined him, who, willing to prevent matters from coming to an extremity, advised the acceptance of these terms. Within the prescribed time, he therefore, returned an answer to that effect. The articles of the treaty were soon exchanged in proper form, and the wounded soldiers given into the hands of Dr. Ferral, who had them safely conveyed to the barrack. As nothing now remained to prevent the insurgents from proceeding to the Donegore encampment, O'Halloran ordered them to take some refreshment, and prepare for the march. But being anxious to know what success his coadjutors had met with in raising the people in other parts of the country, he committed the command of the party to M`Cauley, and accompanied with ten men, well mounted and armed, departed without delay to Donegore. Before setting off, however, he gave M`Cauley directions to bury the soldiers who had been slain in the skirmish, with due respect, in the adjoining church-yard; and to follow immediately after, at a steady pace, so as to arrive at the encampment about four o'clock in the afternoon. M`Cauley obeyed in every particular. The bodies of the soldiers were interred with military honours. Funeral music accompanied the procession to the burial ground; and when the grave closed on the dead, three rounds of musketry were fired over them, by twelve men selected for the purpose. It is said that M`Claverty was so much affected on seeing this generous proceeding, on the part of an enemy, from whom he had expected nothing but outrage and ferocity, that he shed tears; and turning to his fellow prisoner, Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, he exclaimed. “What a pity it is, that men of such generous hearts should possess such erring judgments!” Sir Geoffrey made no reply. He and Berwick had been brought from their confinement in the Point cave, in order to be conveyed to Donegore with the other prisoners. Those who conducted him from the cave, had diverted themselves with his fears, by informing him that he was going to be tried for his crimes by the victorious United Irishmen; and that he should undoubtedly be hanged before the evening. He was in consequence much depressed in spirits, and in no humour to interchange ideas of a pleasant nature with the more courageous and liberal minded M`Claverty.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. III. Ere the ruddy sun be set, Pikes must shiver, javelins sing; Blade with clattering buckler meet, Halbert crash, and helmet ring. (Weave the crimsoned web of war,) Let us go, and let us fly; Where our friends the conflict share, Where they triumph, where they die! Gray. M`Cauley now assembled his men on a height to the north-west of the town, where he occupied about the space of an hour in arranging them into into companies, and putting them through different military evolutions, after which they proceeded to Donegore hill. They had scarcely departed, when a detachment of cavalry, about eighty in number, who had been for some time concealed behind the heights to the southward of the valley in which Larne is situated, now entered the town, in great fury, under the command of a captain Claverill, and was preparing, in the wantonness of revenge, to set fire to the houses, when Small informed them of his treaty with the insurgents, and declared that he would, with all the force under his command, cause it to be respected. The loyalists of the town joined him in the declaration, protesting that they would oppose with their whole power any infringement of the treaty. “If you violate this contract,” said they, “the first news you may expect to hear from the rebel c camp, will be that M`Claverty and his fellow prisoners have fallen victims to your perfidy.” By this firmness the town was saved from the destroying hands of barbarians, who had not the courage to show themselves while it was occupied by that enemy, whom they now affected to despise and detest. When the first intelligence of the insurrection at Larne reached Carrickfergus, this troop of cavalry had been detached there to assist the garrison in suppressing it. On arriving at the vicinity of Larne, they were informed that the soldiers had been defeated, and nearly all slain; and that the survivors, who with their wounded captain had taken refuge in the barrack, were expected soon to surrender to the insurgents, whose numbers, courage and warlike equipment were described in the most exaggerated terms. Intimidated by this account, they did not venture to enter the town, until the enemy had departed. At about eleven o'clock, O'Halloran arrived at the place of encampment. He had expected to find thousands assembled: but he only found about a hundred and fifty men busily employed entrenching the ground. These, however, soon satisfied him that there was no want of zeal in the country. They informed him that, less than half an hour before, upwards of five thousand men had marched thence, under the command of Porter and M`Cracken for Antrim, in order to dislodge the military stationed in that town, and to capture a number of magistrates, who, they were informed, had appointed to meet there that day on some county business. At this intelligence, O'Halloran's heart leapt light within him. He put spurs to his horse, and followed by those who had attended him from Larne, in less than forty minutes overtook the insurgent army. It had just halted at the entrance of the town to form its plan of attack. His arrival was hailed by loud cheers from the assembled multitude; and on relating the occurrences that had taken place in Larne, the air again rang with acclamations; and Porter, M`Cracken, and all the other chiefs, as well as the whole body of the insurgents, with one voice, requested him to assume the command. He consented, on condition that Porter and M`Cracken, should be considered as having equal authority, as well as equal responsibility, in all the measures that should be adopted; “for,” said he, “I am determined to adopt none of which they shall disapprove.” He then inquired into the strength of the opposition they were to encounter, and was informed that there were two hundred and fifty infantry, and one hundred and fifty cavalry, stationed in the town, under the command of a major Siddons, which force would perhaps be augmented by the junction of from fifty to a hundred loyalists. It was stated, also, that they had three or four pieces of cannon; but it was supposed that their ammunition was not abundant. O'Halloran now reviewed the strength and appointments of his own party, and found that it consisted of between seven and eight thousand men, who were promiscuously armed with pikes, muskets, swords, hayforks, &amp;c. They had also two small pieces of cannon, with some experienced cannoniers, who had formerly been in the royal service, to manage them. By people from the town, he was informed that major Siddons, apprized of the intended attack, had drawn up his men in the main street, in the open area, between the market-house and the entrance of the street, his cavalry forming a compact body in front of the market-house, and his infantry lining the sides of the street. On hearing this, O'Halloran made a short encouraging address to his men, which he concluded by observing that they were to fight this battle almost in view of the residence of William Orr, the most lamented martyr in these latter times, for the cause of Irish liberty, that glorious, animating cause for which they had now taken up arms. He exhorted them to fight valiantly in order to avenge his death. “Reflect,” said he, “that his disconsolate widow, and bereaved children, will, this day, hear the dying, repentant cries of his destroyers, and that your shouts of victory will be to them the intelligence, that a portion at least, of their proud and relentless oppressors are humbled to the dust. Let, therefore, our word of battle be `Remember Orr!”' He now selected five hundred men whom he put under the direction of Samuel Orr, the brother of their favourite martyr, with injunctions to take a circuitous route towards the Shane's-castle road, and enter the town from the south-west, while the main body should, as soon as they ascertained the proximity of Orr's approach to the enemy, enter from the eastward by the road on which they were already stationed, by which means the enemy would be attacked on both sides. As O'Halloran expected that major Siddons would endeavour to disperse his men, as soon as they should enter the town, by a charge of cavalry; he placed in his van a phalanx, consisting of four hundred pikemen, forming a compact square of twenty men on each side. This phalanx was divided into five files, each containing four men in front, and the whole range of the twenty men in depth. The second and fourth of these files, were ordered, as soon as the expected charge should be made, to give way and permit the horsemen to follow into the spaces they should thus leave vacant, while the first, third and fifth files remaining firm, should fall upon them on all sides with their pikes. A considerable number of musketeers were ordered to station themselves in the houses of such of the inhabitants as were friendly to their cause, and, from thence, to direct their fire upon their troops. The four hundred pikemen, composing the phalanx, were selected both on account of their enthusiasm and their personal activity. They were supplied with the best manufactured pikes in their whole army, and each division or file was under the conduct of an officer who perfectly comprehended his duty. A promiscuous multitude of thousands on whom no regularity could be imposed, and over whom it was impossible to exert any controul, followed close to the phalanx, which insured its steadiness, while their officers took care to prevent the pressure from being so great as to derange its operations. In front of the whole, their two pieces of cannon were placed; but it was not intended that they should take them farther than the bend of the street, which opened on the military. At this place O'Halloran wished to await the attack of the cavalry, whom he hoped his cannon would throw into some confusion, as they advanced. For this purpose, he also placed a number of men with muskets on the sides, and somewhat in advance of his phalanx, who were directed to keep their station, and not fire on the enemy until the latter should approach to the charge. They were then to retreat by the sides of the streets, and leave the phalanx to its operations. c 2 Having made all his dispositions, and having no time to lose, as he understood the loyalists were in momentary expectation of a reinforcement from Belfast, O'Halloran on ascertaining that Samuel Orr's detachment had nearly reached its destination, rode up to the van exclaiming “Lead on, my boys! Remember Orr!” “Remember Orr!” was reiterated by the whole multitude, and they immediately moved forward. On arriving at the end of the street, whence they had a full view of the enemy, they fired both their cannon and their muskets with such effect that about twenty of the dragoons, ten or twelve of the infantry, and all the men who were stationed at one of the enemy's cannon, were killed. The fire of the troops did comparatively little execution, the insurgents having chiefly withdrawn themselves behind the corner of the street. Five or six, however, were killed, and one of their cannon was dismounted! As O'Halloran had expected, Siddons supposing their disappearance, at that moment, a mark of their intimidation, thought to decide the affair at once by a charge of his cavalry. He accordingly gave orders to that effect; on perceiving which, the insurgent musketeers speedily retreated, as they had been directed, which encouraged Siddons hastily to advance at full-gallop, calling on them as rebels to lay down their arms and disperse. On the approach of the cavalry, the front men of the three divisions of the phalanx that were to remain firm, presented their pikes, and prevented their progress; but the other two divisions retiring as they were directed, the cavalry followed into the vacancies; and, in a few minutes, every man and horse was prostrated to the earth. A torrent of pikes which they could neither escape nor resist, rushed upon them from every direction. It was in vain that they called for quarter. Their cries were either unheard or disregarded, in the terrible tumult. The fatal war-word “Remember Orr” alone resounded from every quarter, and deafened the voice of mercy. Siddons, on seeing this disaster, rode back to call his infantry into action; but they were panic struck, and on the appearance of Samuel Orr's party had fled behind the wall that surrounded Lord Massareene's castle, which fronted the end of the street; and even of this refuge they would have been deprived, had it not been for the cowardice of Orr. On perceiving them flying towards the castle, past the one side of which he was entering the town with his men, he supposed that they were advancing to attack him. He, therefore, took the alarm, and putting spurs to his horse, set off on an absolute flight. His men seeing their leader fly, without staying to inquire the cause, followed his example, and dispersed in all directions, in consequence of which Siddons's infantry were enabled to effect their escape into the castle yard. Siddons seeing it vain to attempt to rally cowards, and in despair for the fate of his cavalry, gallopped back to the scene of slaughter, to beg quarter for such as survived, or to die along with them. O'Halloran, who had been unable to restrain the fury of the insurgents, or to save a single horseman, perceiving his approach, and aware of his danger, burst furiously through the crowd, calling after some men who were rushing towards Siddons, to halt and not slay him; and he reached them just in time to arrest the arm of one man who had aimed at him a deadly blow. Although broken in its force, the weapon still descended and knocked off Siddons's hat, without, however, inflicting any wound. O'Halloran ordered the man to lift the hat, and present it to Siddons, and was obeyed. “I am your prisoner,” said Siddons, and he held out the handle of his sword to O'Halloran, which was accepted. O'Halloran hastily gave him in charge to three men, who stood convenient, and returned to where the work of destruction was still going on upon the cavalry. He had scarcely done so, when some of the troops firing from behind the wall where they had taken shelter, upon Siddons's guard, brought the whole three to the ground. Siddons immediately turned his horse, and in another moment was also in shelter of the castle wall. The carnage of the cavalry was now nearly over, and O'Halloran had succeeded in saving only five from destruction. He found afterwards, however, that Porter and M`Cracken had saved seven others, but four of them were supposed to be too severely wounded to survive. In a few minutes his attention was drawn to another fatal incident, which was taking place near the Court-house, which stood between Lord Massareene's castle, where the infantry had taken refuge, and the scene of battle. He perceived a gentleman on horseback hastily advancing, and four men rushing to attack him with pikes. He clapped spurs to his horse to save him, but he was too far distant, and before he could reach the scene, not only was the stranger wounded in several places, but three of his assailants were shot dead, by a volley fired from the troops from behind the castle wall. O'Halloran, however, approached, screened from the fire of the troops, by the Court-house; and ascertaining that the stranger was the Earl O'Neil, whose private character he much respected, he caused him to be carried into a house, and ordered him to be well treated; and immediately despatching a messenger for surgical assistance, again joined his companions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IV. But that vain victory has ruined all, They form no longer to their leader's call; In vain he doth whate'er a chief may do, To check the headlong fury of that crew; In vain their stubborn ardour he would tame, The hand that kindles cannot quench the flame; The weary foe alone hath turned their mood, And shown their rashness to that erring brood. Byron. Although the insurgents had gained a complete victory and were in absolute possession of the town, Massareene Castle excepted, their exultation was but short lived. Indeed they had scarcely time to be sensible of its existence before they were thrown into great perplexity by the hasty arrival of some of their friends, with very discouraging intelligence. They informed them that general Nugent was rapidly advancing, and was now only a few miles distant at the head of two thousand men, and a heavy train of artillery, in order to attack them. Various were the opinions now given concerning what measures should be adopted. Some were immediately for storming the walls behind which Siddons's infantry had taken shelter; others were for marching to meet Nugent, and attack him in the open country; while some, more timid or less zealous than the rest, hinted at the propriety of taking advantage of their recent success, by opening a negociation with the approaching army. Great clamour and confusion took place in expressing these different opinions. Scarcely any one was silent; and so many spoke at once that scarcely any one understood what another proposed. O'Halloran at length obtained a hearing among the principal officers, who, after several unavailing attempts to procure silence and attention amidst the irrepressible confusion of the multitude, separated themselves from it. After deploring the unmanageable dispositions of their followers, “my friends,” said he, “we must even with such materials, attempt by some means to stem the tide of misfortune, before we give up all for lost. We must not despair—brave men never despair in a good cause. The irregularities of these people may grieve you; the timidity of some, the fanaticism of others, and the ungovernable temper of all, may excite anxiety in your minds concerning our approaching enemy. But in the midst of anxiety, duty must be performed; by what method, reason must be consulted. The unthinking and giddy crowd, will not, cannot reason. You must, therefore, both reason and decide for them, otherwise they will become a feeble, and almost resistless prey, to their enemies. I shall give you my opinion. “It has been proposed to negociate, but unless you intend absolutely to abandon the cause, to assert which, by force of arms, we have been so many years preparing, and for which you have this day so gallantly fought, and obtained, by the blessing of Providence, so signal a victory, you will not listen to this proposal. By our enemies nothing under present circumstances will be expected but unconditional surrender, which would be followed by unmerciful slaughter. We have commenced, we must go on with the work—it would be ruin to go back. “As to the proposal of attacking Massareene castle, the advancing enemy is too near, according to our information, to permit that. It is evident that their coming on us while engaged in such an attack would be attended with the most disastrous consequences. “No rational counsel, in my opinion, has yet been offered for your consideration. The most salutary that has been offered seems to be that which advises you to march out and oppose Nugent on the field; as in so doing you might have a chance, though I think it would be but a very slight one, of overcoming so numerous and well appointed an army as his. “My opinion, taking all circumstances into view, is that we should immediately withdraw from the town, and return to the encampment at Donegore, where, during the evening, we may expect to be joined by large reinforcements from all parts of the country, and where from the entrenchments already thrown up, and the nature of the ground, no army can attack us but at a great disadvantage. There we may await the occurrences of favourable opportunities to harrass our enemies, or if they shall have the hardihood to attack us, the chance of victory will be much on our side.” The officers agreed to the wisdom of this opinion, and having by great exertions, at length procured an audience from the multitude, earnestly pressed its adoption. But that multitude was now greatly diminished—more than one-half of its number had disappeared. Some were panic-struck at the approach of so formidable an army; some were horror-struck at the scene of carnage they had just witnessed, and could not bear the idea of seeing it repeated; while others were disgusted at the dissonance of opinion, clamour and confusion which had taken place, and anticipating that numbers would imitate the treachery of Orr's party, and desert the cause, since there was no authority or regulation by which defection could be prevented, resolved not to be the last to get rid of so troublesome and perilous an enterprise. From these various motives, while the leaders were deliberating on what measure to adopt, several thousands had withdrawn from the insurrection standard; so that when they came to make known their decision, as before stated, they found that nearly one-half of their number had left them. The brave phalanx, however, to whose intrepidity the victory they had gained was altogether owing, still remained. It had lost about a third of its original number. But the gallant spirits who composed it, were elevated by the excitement of their successful fighting, and by the plaudits of their companions. They now received the thanks of O'Halloran, delivered publicly in the name of the other officers, and of their country, for their good conduct, and the services they had performed. “Had Orr's party only acted with half your heroism,” said he, in concluding his address of thanks, “we should now have been in possession of Massareene castle; and, protected by its walls, we might have bade defiance to the coming enemy. As it is, we must now withdraw to Donegore, and, fortified in that position, where we shall receive large reinforcements, we can await with advantage the assault of our opponents.” A headstrong enthusiast of the name of Campbell, who had during the battle performed prodigies of valour, now stepped from the ranks, all covered as he was with blood and dust, and addressed O'Halloran. “Why should we retreat?” he exclaimed. “We have gained a great victory. Let us wait for the enemy here. I'll warrant we shall give a good account of him. It is time enough to fly when we are beaten. Surely, Mr. O'Halloran wont turn coward, like Orr.” “Bravo! bravo!” shouted numbers of the most violent and determined. “Campbell is right! We shall fight them here!” It was in vain that O'Halloran expostulated with them, and represented the imprudence and even madness of their determination. They could not understand his reasoning. The majority had indeed, by this time, become too intoxicated to understand it, for they had plundered the ardent spirits contained in the houses of the royalists. O'Halloran deplored their infatuation and misconduct; but he determined not to desert them. “Perhaps,” said he to Porter, “some means may yet be found to save these people. It is our duty to stand by them, and to do our best to avert their ruin.” He then told them that although he disapproved of their wishes, he would comply with them; and make an immediate stand against the enemy. “But we must choose better ground,” said he. “Will you submit to my directions? Heaven may yet grant us success.” He was answered by loud cheers of approbation, and he immediately commenced making his arrangements for receiving the enemy. At the eastern entrance of the town there was a large meadow, surrounded by a thick hedge, at one corner of which two roads met. Along one of these roads it was known that the enemy was advancing, and here O'Halloran was determined to make his stand, with the view of having the other road, which led to Donegore, open and convenient for his men, in case they should be worsted, to retreat to that rendezvous, without being scattered in a confused flight, which he knew would be the case if they should be defeated in the streets. Vol. II. D He lined the whole range of the hedge, along the road on which he expected the attack, with musketeers, directing them to remain in shelter of the ditch, to be steady and not to expend their fire until they were sure of their object. His phalanx was not of much service, in its embodied form, in repelling an attack to be made, as he expected, with fire-arms; nay, that very compactness which, together with the nature of its weapons, rendered it so formidable to a charge of cavalry, or of the bayonet, would here have been a disadvantage. Instead, therefore, of arranging it as formerly, into the form of a solid square, he drew up the men who composed it, into that of a semi-circle, and stationed them a few paces behind the musketeers, with instructions, in the event of being attacked with artillery or musketry, to throw themselves flat on the grass; but, to fall immediately into their former compact square form, in case they should be attacked with the cavalry or charged with the bayonet. His few pieces of artillery, he planted at the eastern end of the field, on the left of his phalanx, and in such a situation as would permit them to be the most efficiently employed against the enemy. The rest of his followers not being under much discipline, nor, indeed, as he plainly perceived, likely to be of much service during the conflict, he placed in various groups about the field, desiring them, while the fire of their adversaries continued, to shelter themselves as much as possible among the long meadow grass, or in the ditch that surrounded the field; but if a close charge should be made, to be prompt in assisting the phalanx to repel it. He now, after exhorting them to firmness and bravery, reminded them that Donegore hill was the place of rendezvous, to which, in case of a defeat, every man should be careful to direct his course. He had scarcely finished this exhortation when the eastern hill, at the distance of about a mile, began to glitter in the sun, and a forest of bayonets appeared gradually approaching. The whole hill became covered with the scarlet uniforms of the royal troops, who kept steadily advancing to the military music of “Croppies lie down.” They halted when within a quarter of a mile from the field occupied by the insurgents. Immediately nine pieces of cannon were wheeled round, and drawn at full gallop somewhat nearer, to the top of a rising ground, and their muzzles turned to the field. Four companies of infantry were at the same time marched into an adjoining pasture field. As yet not a shot was fired, and every voice was silent for a few minutes; even all motion seemed suspended, while the insurgents gazed, during this dreadful pause, on the terrible army that was thus brought against them, with the most intense anxiety and awe. But this pause was indeed short; for on the other road, on which no enemy was expected, a large body of both horse and foot made their appearance. Nugent, who had reconnoitred the position of the insurgents before he appeared in view, had detached this body by a circuitous route, under the command of colonel Lumly, to attack them on that side, by which means they would be nearly surrounded. In a moment the cannons opened their mouths, and a destructive fire was at the same instant poured both by Lumly's troops and those which occupied the pasture field, on the unfortunate insurgents. The cannon of the latter, was also fired; but it was only once, for their cannoniers either fled or fell, while the terrified musketeers, who were concealed behind the hedge, discharged their pieces at random and fled also. The pikemen also started up to fly; for a fiery death was around them, and fast enclosing them on all sides. As Lumly's party occupied the road by which they endeavoured to escape, O'Halloran at the head of a considerable number of pikemen, the majority of whom belonged to his heroic phalanx, made on it a rapid and resolute charge, which succeeded in throwing it into confusion, and opened the way for escape. Immediately the whole insurgent force rushed in desperation to that quarter, for unabated destruction continued to assail them from every other; and by the weight and fierceness of their attack, and the length of their pikes, over-threw all opposition. O'Halloran individually fought with wonderful energy and success. Twice when Lumly had rallied a portion of his troops to arrest his progress, at the head of his chosen body did he break his way through. A third time Lumly attempted it, and it proved fatal to him. “That officer must be slain or we shall not escape,” exclaimed O'Halloran, who perceived the whole of Nugent's force fast approaching from behind; and as he made the exclamation, he dashed his horse forwards, and Lumly and he instantly met. Their swords were in a moment shivered to pieces, but a stump of O'Halloran's still remained, with which, at one blow, he brought his antagonist to the ground. “To Donegore, my men!” said he. “Stop for nothing;” and without minding the fallen Lumly, they rushed over him with the speed and ferocity of wild animals, presenting a terrible front of pikes, which cleared the way as they flew along. Lumly's party seeing their commander fall, did not, however, offer much more opposition, so that the way was easily kept open for their flight. Nugent now despatched his cavalry in pursuit of the fugitives, who soon scattering, fled in all directions; not, however, until numbers of them had fallen victims to the firing of the carbines of their pursuers. As they took into the fields or into the by-roads and private avenues, the cavalry separated into small parties, in order to follow them. One party pursued some of them as far as Templepatrick, to which town, after pillaging it, they set fire, and consumed upwards of a hundred dwelling houses, besides committing many acts of violence and cruelty on the inhabitants. Night alone put an end to the havoc, destruction and horror of this disastrous day; and, at a late hour, the pursuing cavalry rejoined their companions in Antrim. Such of the wounded of the insurgents as had fallen into the hands of the victors, were carried to the court-house, and in a summary manner tried by martial law, and sentenced to die the next morning. Between seven and eight hundred of them, had been killed during the day, and between eighty and ninety were now under sentence of death. Of the military, about one hundred and seventy had fallen in both actions. But the deaths which the royalists most lamented were those of lord O'Neil and colonel Lumly. The latter, on being unhorsed by O'Halloran, had received a mortal stroke with a pike from one of the insurgents, another of whom had rolled him into the ditch, by the road side, where, after the conflict was over, he was found by some of the soldiers just expiring. Lord O'Neil suffered extremely from his wounds until the next morning, when he also expired. He had begged Nugent, almost with his last breath, to spare the lives of the deluded people, and not to Vol. II. D 2 permit any feelings of revenge to excite him to unnecessary severity in the execution of his duty. For the prisoners now under the sentence of death he particularly pleaded, and had their lives granted to his intercession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. V. Lo! comes a flag to summon their surrender. To fight or yield is now the question with them: To fight for what?—a cause they scarce approve of, And which, even if they did, they see is hopeless. To yield unbargained, would betray too much Of cowardice, as if they feared a battle. It would be madness too without conditions, To throw themselves into the power of those Whose power they have insulted. But negotiate! Negotiate! is the cry—get terms or fight. Irish Soothsayer. O'Halloran, after the discomfiture of his forces, rode in company with M`Cracken, Porter, and a few others, at full speed to Donegore, on reaching which he found that his old associates from Larne, had just arrived. A vast concourse from other parts of the country had flocked to this rendezvous; and the number was every moment increasing; so that before night came, it was supposed that the encampment contained no fewer than ten thousand men. They were not all, however, equally zealous. The news of the defeat at Antrim, filled some of them with considerable dismay; and a great many took advantage of the night to withdraw from such a dangerous enterprise. When the morning came, the diminution of their numbers, from these desertions, was very perceptible; and seemed very generally to shake that mutual confidence in each other, which is so necessary to the success of warlike operations. Hence doubt and perplexity began to reign over the whole camp, a circumstance which did not escape the penetration of M`Claverty. He conceived it to afford a favourable opportunity of once more attempting to dissuade them from persevering in their designs. He accordingly addressed them, promising to negotiate for them, an absolute pardon for all they had done, if they would quietly lay down their arms and disperse. He was listened to with the more attention, even by those who were not intimidated by the preceding day's misfortunes, (and who still formed a sufficiently numerous body to enforce the adherence of the rest, if they should think proper to do so,) by intelligence which had been just received of the massacre of the Protestants at Wexford, and the other atrocities committed by the insurgents of the Catholic persuasion in the South. The nine-tenths of their number being Presbyterians, were easily excited on this subject, and without much difficulty made to believe that they had entered into a rebellion which was likely to be converted into a war of religious vengeance, like the former Irish rebellions, against the atrocities of which they had, from their infancy, been taught to feel the most inveterate abhorrence. M`Claverty was well aware of this circumstance, and did not neglect to avail himself of it. After enlarging on the extreme improbability of final success attending their exertions—“And for what is it, my friends,” said he, “that you are making these exertions, at the awful risk of your lives and of every thing else dear to you? Your views, no doubt, are confined to the acquirement of some civil or political right, of which you suppose yourselves deprived, whereas, you may rely on it, that by far the greater portion of your confederacy, at present in arms throughout the kingdom, have very different views. Their's is a religious warfare. They regard civil grievances as of comparatively little importance, to those religious restrictions which they conceive an heretical government has imposed upon them. Wishing for your aid, they have, until they got you, as they supposed, too far involved to retreat with safety, kept the real object of their sedition out of view. But they have now thrown off the cloak. They have put themselves under the absolute direction of their priests, who alone govern in their counsels, and command in their battles; and whose chief desire is the extirpation of that religion you profess, and the infliction of a malignant, but as they teach their fanatical followers, a holy revenge on its professors. In selecting their victims, you perceive that already they do not inquire, are they royalists, but are they Protestants? Lay your hands upon your hearts, and ask if your conscience will justify you in fighting with such confederates, in such a cause? Pause, I beseech you, and reflect that the moment the power and influence of Britain is expelled this country, Protestantism is also expelled. You would have neither equal numbers, nor equal ferocity with your Catholic confederates; you would, consequently, be utterly unable to prevent the establishment of Catholic supremacy and intolerance in the Island. Oh! my friends, withdraw from this unnatural confederacy ere it be too late. Perhaps there are some among you who think that it is already too late; who will tell you that you have even now gone too far to retrace your steps; that you have offended the constituted authorities past forgiveness; and that you have no alternative but to persevere. Do not listen to such deceitful language. You have not yet done any thing, as a body, but what I am persuaded, the government will freely pardon, on condition of your returning peaceably to your allegiance. Now is your time successfully to negotiate for pardon. You are still in force, with arms in your hands, but after your defeat, and that defeat is easily foreseen, from the force which is now coming against you, you may in vain implore from the clemency, what you can now in some measure demand from the policy of the government. General Nugent whose victorious army will be here in a few hours, is my friend. With him, if you permit me, I will negotiate for you, and I pledge my honour, that in doing so I shall consult your interests as faithfully as if I were of your party.” The majority of the insurgents listened to this reasoning with seeming approbation, but there were a few who acted very differently. They were either Catholics, or Protestants who had already so openly signalized themselves in the rebellion that they were hopeless of pardon. These began to raise the cry of cowardice and treachery, against all who appeard wavering, which soon produced much dissention throughout the camp; and the approaching army was considerably advanced, without any resolution being formed either for battle or negotiation. At length the royal standard was seen floating in the air, and all the glittering pomp of war perceived, at the distance of a few miles, to be approaching the hill. Contention ceased for some minutes, while every eye contemplated this imposing spectacle in profound and awe-struck silence. M`Claverty sprung again to his feet. All eyes were directed to him. “O, my neighbours, my friends!” he exclaimed, “Negotiate now or perish! Another hour may place pardon beyond your reach.” “We will, we will negotiate,” was the spontaneous cry which now burst from almost every mouth. O'Halloran, M`Cracken, Porter, M`Cauley and Darragh, (the two latter of whom were Catholics, and the whole five either already proscribed or without expectation of pardon,) at first endeavoured to check the expression of this resolution, and to inspire the multitude with more firm and courageous sentiments. But they soon found themselves obliged to yield to the torrent. O'Halloran, indeed, now began to perceive that the cause had become desperate. No French aid had arrived to afford its adherents a rallying point, while the bigotry and cruelty of its friends in the South, cooled and disgusted those in the North, and tended more to its abandonment and ruin than the whole power of the government. He, therefore, who was still recognized as their commander, made but a faint opposition to the cry for negotiation. M`Cracken and Porter soon also withdrew their opposition; perhaps as much from having fallen into a similar train of reflection, as from the apparent impossibility of resisting the general decision. They were employed in drawing up proposals to be presented to general Nugent as the conditions of their surrender, when an officer from the royal army appeared advancing on horseback towards the hill, bearing a white flag. O'Halloran, M`Claverty, and one Watt, an influential man among them, who had been very strenuous in recommending negotiation, were appointed a committee to receive the messenger, and report his business to the people. They advanced some distance down the hill to meet him, carrying with them the propositions they had prepared. M`Claverty soon recognised the flag-bearer to be an intimate friend, a captain Hutton, whom he knew to be a man of honour and humanity. “What!” said Hutton, as he approached M`Claverty, “I understood you were the prisoner of these people. I now perceive you to be one of their confidential agents.” “Fate has, indeed, made me their prisoner,” said M`Claverty. “But humanity has at present induced me to become their agent, and they have had sufficient confidence in my honour to entrust me with the office.” “I am glad of it,” returned the other, “for it augurs favourably for the termination of the business with which I am entrusted. I have been sent to summon these people to deliver up their arms, and throw themselves on his majesty's mercy.” “Surely,” said O'Halloran, “your commander does not expect an unconditional surrender from men with arms in their hands, strong in numbers, strong in position, and if urged to extremity, strong also in courage and determination. To prevent the effusion of human blood, we will disperse if the requisite terms are granted us. If they are refused, however, we can fight, and a few hours may give us the power of dictating instead of begging terms.” “I look on myself,” said M`Claverty, “as a mediator in this case. To the government I am attached from principle, and to those whose prisoner I am, and who, confiding in my pledged word, have deputed me to assist in the management of this affair, I am bound by honour. To them I am also bound by gratitude for the respectful treatment I have received since I fell into their hands. In giving my advice, therefore, both parties may be assured that I do it with a view to their mutual advantage. I can conceive of no detriment that the government would sustain by granting an absolute pardon to these people for the delusions and errors into which they have fallen, on condition of their returning quietly to their duty; and to accept of such a pardon, I believe, they are already convinced is to consult their true interest.” “Gentlemen,” said Hutton, “my powers do not extend to the granting of a pardon. I have been merely sent to demand an unconditional surrender; but whatever proposals you may please to make, I shall convey them to our commander, and return in one hour with his answer.” “Here are our proposals,” replied O'Halloran, producing the written documents to the messenger. “Submit them to your general; and tell him, that rather than submit to terms less favourable than these, we are resolved, in God's name, to try the issue of a battle.” The officer received the papers, and was about departing, when M`Claverty called on him to stay a moment. “Convey my earnest request to general Nugent,” said he, “that he will sooth the feelings of the people as much as possible. They now see their delusion, and are desirous of reconciliation with the established authorities, not so much from fear, as from conviction of their error. The accounts from Wexford have made great impressions on them; and, I believe, that they sincerely repent having joined such a confederacy. Tell him also, that I, and their other prisoners, have been treated well; and that, notwithstanding their irregularity and total want of discipline, they have hitherto committed no excess repugnant to humanity.” “I shall with pleasure deliver your message,” replied Hutton. “Good morning, gentlemen. I sincerely hope this affair will terminate without more bloodshed.” He then spurred his horse, and hastened towards the royal army. Nugent having perused the proposals, called his officers together to deliberate concerning them. They were to the following effect: “That general Nugent and the principal officers under Vol. II. E his command, shall guarantee to the army of the United Irishmen, now encamped on Donegore hill, a full and free indemnity for all past transactions, in which indemnity, all the United officers as well as private men, and all the prisoners for matters of state, now in the jails of Carrickfergus and Downpatrick, or at the camp of Blarrismoor, or in the towns of Belfast, Lisburn, Antrim and Ballymena, shall be included; on which conditions the said army of the United Irishmen, shall immediately, without committing any further act of hostility, disband, and the individuals composing it, return to their respective homes.” “Gentlemen,” said Nugent, “you will perceive that some of these demands are absolutely beyond our power to grant. We have no controul over any prisoners but those we have ourselves taken and have now in custody; neither can we fly in the face of the civil authority, by guaranteeing a pardon to several individuals now known to be in the rebel camp, who are already in a state of proscription for their crimes and treasons. It is my opinion, therefore, that we cannot, in duty, listen to these terms; but on account of the favourable report given by Mr. M`Claverty, of the present dispositions of these blind-led people, as well as from humane considerations, I will, should it meet with your approbation, make another effort to induce a submission without blood-shed.” It was then agreed that Hutton should return to the insurgent camp with the following note. “General Nugent, and the officers under his command, find some of the terms required by the insurgents on Donegore hill, beyond their power to grant. They cannot interfere with the intentions of government respecting any prisoners, but such as they have themselves taken, and have in their immediate custody. These they are willing to discharge. There are several individuals in the insurgent army, already pointed out by the government as persons whose offences render them unworthy of pardon. Over the fate of these persons they have no controul; neither do they think it their duty to include, in any promise of pardon, those mischievous men, whose delusive doctrines have seduced their fellow-subjects into the criminal and unfortunate measures they have adopted. From the general pardon, therefore, which they agree to guarantee to all others now assembled on Donegore hill, who shall, within one hour after they receive this notification, deliver up their arms and return peaceably to their homes and employments, they exclude the following persons, and description of persons, viz. Henry O'Halloran, the Rev. James Porter, Henry M`Cracken, Thomas Story, Thomas Archer, and all who may have been guilty of assassination, or of wantonly burning the houses, or otherwise destroying the properties of the loyal inhabitants of the country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VI. Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself! it cannot Be called our mother, but our grave; where nothing, But who knows nothing, is seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rend the air, Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstacy; the dead man's knell Is there scarce asked for whom, and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or e'er they sicken. Shakspeare. Previous to the return of Hutton with the foregoing note, containing Nugent's ultimate offer, a man on horseback, who said he had travelled all night, arrived at the insurgent camp, with the following letter for O'Halloran: June 7th, 1798. “Dear Sir—It has fallen to my lot to communicate to you the unfortunate news of the forces we assembled this morning, being completely defeated and dispersed, after a severe conflict with a large body of the king's troops, near Ballynahinch, in which it is supposed, that we lost upwards of one thousand men. “According to previous arrangement we began about midnight to assemble in the neighbourhood of Saintfield, where we had a slight skirmish with a small body of militia stationed there, over whom we obtained the advantage, having, with only the loss of one man, killed six of theirs, and compelled the rest to retreat. “We then proceeded to Ballynahinch, and encamped on lord Moira's demesne adjoining the town. Here our numbers increased so rapidly, that before noon, we were nearly twelve thousand strong. Colonel Munroe joined us about ten o'clock with a large body from the neighbourhood of Lisburn and Hilsborough. About one o'clock the king's troops arrived from the camp at Blarrismoor, and halted on a hill opposite, part of the town being between us. “They soon commenced a cannonade, which we attempted to return, having three small field-pieces, but we could not manage them to much advantage, whereas their fire annoyed us extremely. Being conscious of our superiority in point of numbers, it was, therefore, agreed that we should rush over the intermediate ground, and charge them with pikes. For this purpose, we had completed the necessary arrangements, and were proceeding forward, when we were attacked with a volley of musketry from behind, by a party, which, unnoticed by us, they had detached round the hill, and which thus took us in the rear by surprise. Many of our men immediately fled; but the greater number rushed on to the intended attack. “When within thirty yards of our opponents, we received a dreadful discharge of musketry, which checked us for an instant by levelling hundreds of us to the ground. My left arm was broken on this occasion; but I was impelled along by the press of the multitude, which had resumed its motion forwards. “We soon reached our adversaries, and made on them a very effective charge, for in a few minutes they were compelled to retreat some distance from the hill, but there, facing about, they poured upon us another fire so destructive that hundreds Vol. II. E 2 fell to the ground, while hundreds more threw down their arms and fled. “At this important crisis, the troops behind us also repeated their fire and increased our confusion. To prevent our rallying, for though much broken, some of us would still have made a stand, their cavalry now galloped furiously amongst us and completed our defeat. “The cavalry in continuing the pursuit, committed dreadful havoc throughout the country. The greater part of Ballynahinch, the whole of Saintfield, and country houses without number, have been consigned to flames, and are now only smoking ruins. “The destruction is not yet over. From the hill on which I am concealed, we can see every moment new volumes of conflagration arising. My heart sickens at the disasters of the day. I trust in God, you have been more fortunate in your county. If not, I much fear that the cause for which we have been so long and so anxiously preparing to make this struggle, is indeed lost, and that we shall now have, each of us to await with what fortitude we can, the fate which an oppressive, cruel and highly incensed government, may think fit to award us. “The unfortunate religious jealousy that exists among the people has been one great cause of our failure. Some accounts of the misconduct of the Catholics in the South arrived here the day before yesterday, which cooled the ardour of the Presbyterians, in whom consisted our main strength. Not one in ten of that persuasion, in whom we confided, have joined us; and although, as you well know, the Catholic population of the county is not one to twenty, yet more than the half of those who took arms were of that body. “If you be yet in force, endeavour all you can, I bessech you, to prevent the poison of the Wexford news from infecting the minds of your men, otherwise all hopes of liberty for poor Ireland will indeed soon be over. It is to put you on your guard in this matter, that I make such haste to dispatch this courier, who, as he is acquainted with the country, and has the advantage of the night to travel in, will, I hope, reach you in safety. “Munroe and several of our leaders have been captured. Death, no doubt, will be their portion. Their doom is perhaps already awarded, for our merciless pursuers will lose no time, when they seize any of us, in glutting their vengeance. “May heaven preserve you from such misfortunes as we have experienced! I am, with an aching heart, “Your friend, “M. R—Y.” When O'Halloran had communicated the contents of this letter to his fellow chiefs; “it is in vain,” said he, “to contend longer. A battle here, even if we could persuade our men to risk one, would only be additional slaughter. A victory itself could scarcely retrieve the prospects with which we set out. It is our duty, therefore, for the sake of these people, to accept whatever conditions may be offered. For myself, should I be demanded as a sacrifice, I am resigned to my fate, and shall submit, I hope, without murmuring. I did not engage in this enterprise without calculating on the chance and consequences of failure, and preparing my mind, if it should be necessary, to endure the severest forms of death.” Porter and M`Cracken deliberated a few moments. They then exclaimed, “It must be so; we must yield to fate! Since we can do no more for our country, we care little for ourselves; and to whatever lot Providence has ordered for us, we shall, as becomes us, submit. But Nugent's messenger returns; let us hear the terms, and then, all resistance out of view, we can decide as to the steps we must take.” The reply of Nugent to their proposals was given to O'Halloran. He read it aloud to the people. When he had done, all remained silent in expectation of receiving his opinion; he perceived it; and spoke as follows: “My friends, you have sufficiently proved your attachment for the cause of liberty and your country. Fate forbids that cause to prevail; and it is now become necessary for you to relinquish the pleasing hope, and yield once more to that government you have attempted to resist. These are the terms offered for your submission. You will obtain no better. From their benefits, I and some of my dearest friends are excluded. But we must give way to our destiny. I should abhor myself, if from any personal consideration, I could be withheld from giving you what I conceive to be the most salutary counsel, in your present situation. You ought to accept of these conditions, and surrender. I have just become acquainted with circumstances which leave you no other alternative. Our friends in the county of Down have met with a total and irretrievable overthrow. Farewell! I and my proscribed friends, will provide for our own safety, as prudence may dictate.” He immediately mounted his horse, and accompained by Porter, M`Cracken, and the other exempted persons, galloped from the hill. The multitude, struck with admiration, for several minutes gazed after them in profound silence. M`Claverty then addressed the people. “My friends and fellow subjects,” said he, “I admire the magnanimity of your late leader, and sincerely hope that he may ultimately escape the dangers that surround him. A free pardon is offered to you, will you accept it? The messenger awaits your reply.” “We will—we will accept it,” was answered by a thousand voices. A man of the name of Quin now stepped forward, and said aloud to M`Claverty “Sir, be our representative in this affair. Be it your care to prevent any infringement of these conditions.” “It shall be my care,” replied M`Claverty. The people then threw their arms on the ground, and returned every man to his own home. Thus terminated this insurrection in the North, the only part of the kingdom, of which, from the intelligent and persevering character of the people, the government was seriously apprehensive; and thus, in a few days, was blown into air, those magnificent but impracticable schemes of social equality, and national independence, over which the fond imaginations of thousands of Irishmen had for years been brooding. The impolicy of the Southern insurgents in betraying so early a zeal for the destruction of that religion which was by far the most prevalent among their Northern coadjutors, unquestionably contributed more to the speedy overthrow of this ill concerted conspiracy, than either the vigilance or force of the government. Indeed so much were the Northerns disgusted and alarmed at the conduct of their Southern confederates, that out of the nine counties of Ulster, which contained upwards of two hundred thousand United Irishmen, in only two had the insurrection been of any consequence; and in these two, a coolness in the cause was immediately manifested by the populace when intelligence was received of the Southern atrocities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">June 7th, 1798. “Dear Sir—It has fallen to my lot to communicate to you the unfortunate news of the forces we assembled this morning, being completely defeated and dispersed, after a severe conflict with a large body of the king's troops, near Ballynahinch, in which it is supposed, that we lost upwards of one thousand men. “According to previous arrangement we began about midnight to assemble in the neighbourhood of Saintfield, where we had a slight skirmish with a small body of militia stationed there, over whom we obtained the advantage, having, with only the loss of one man, killed six of theirs, and compelled the rest to retreat. “We then proceeded to Ballynahinch, and encamped on lord Moira's demesne adjoining the town. Here our numbers increased so rapidly, that before noon, we were nearly twelve thousand strong. Colonel Munroe joined us about ten o'clock with a large body from the neighbourhood of Lisburn and Hilsborough. About one o'clock the king's troops arrived from the camp at Blarrismoor, and halted on a hill opposite, part of the town being between us. “They soon commenced a cannonade, which we attempted to return, having three small field-pieces, but we could not manage them to much advantage, whereas their fire annoyed us extremely. Being conscious of our superiority in point of numbers, it was, therefore, agreed that we should rush over the intermediate ground, and charge them with pikes. For this purpose, we had completed the necessary arrangements, and were proceeding forward, when we were attacked with a volley of musketry from behind, by a party, which, unnoticed by us, they had detached round the hill, and which thus took us in the rear by surprise. Many of our men immediately fled; but the greater number rushed on to the intended attack. “When within thirty yards of our opponents, we received a dreadful discharge of musketry, which checked us for an instant by levelling hundreds of us to the ground. My left arm was broken on this occasion; but I was impelled along by the press of the multitude, which had resumed its motion forwards. “We soon reached our adversaries, and made on them a very effective charge, for in a few minutes they were compelled to retreat some distance from the hill, but there, facing about, they poured upon us another fire so destructive that hundreds Vol. II. E 2 fell to the ground, while hundreds more threw down their arms and fled. “At this important crisis, the troops behind us also repeated their fire and increased our confusion. To prevent our rallying, for though much broken, some of us would still have made a stand, their cavalry now galloped furiously amongst us and completed our defeat. “The cavalry in continuing the pursuit, committed dreadful havoc throughout the country. The greater part of Ballynahinch, the whole of Saintfield, and country houses without number, have been consigned to flames, and are now only smoking ruins. “The destruction is not yet over. From the hill on which I am concealed, we can see every moment new volumes of conflagration arising. My heart sickens at the disasters of the day. I trust in God, you have been more fortunate in your county. If not, I much fear that the cause for which we have been so long and so anxiously preparing to make this struggle, is indeed lost, and that we shall now have, each of us to await with what fortitude we can, the fate which an oppressive, cruel and highly incensed government, may think fit to award us. “The unfortunate religious jealousy that exists among the people has been one great cause of our failure. Some accounts of the misconduct of the Catholics in the South arrived here the day before yesterday, which cooled the ardour of the Presbyterians, in whom consisted our main strength. Not one in ten of that persuasion, in whom we confided, have joined us; and although, as you well know, the Catholic population of the county is not one to twenty, yet more than the half of those who took arms were of that body. “If you be yet in force, endeavour all you can, I bessech you, to prevent the poison of the Wexford news from infecting the minds of your men, otherwise all hopes of liberty for poor Ireland will indeed soon be over.

Still as I haste the Tartan shouts behind, And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind; In rage of heart, with ruin in his hand, He blasts our harvests, and deforms our land; Yon citron grove, where first in fear we came, Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame: Far fly the swains, like us, in deep despair, And leave to ruffian hands their fleecy care. Collins. After leaving Donegore hill, O'Halloran and his companions did not relax their speed until they reached Ballyclare, a town about five miles distant. Here they stopped for some refreshment, and with a view to consult on what measures they should adopt for their safety. But here they had not been many minutes, until the town was beset by a troop of horse, that had just arrived from Larne, on their way to join Nugent in his attack upon the insurgents at Donegore. These were the men who, as the reader will remember, entered Larne the preceding day under the command of Captain Claverill, and would have set fire to the town after the insurgents left it, had they not been prevented by Small and his party. They were now informed of the encampment at Donegore being broken up, for which the valiant Captain Caverill swore he was damned sorry, as he had expected to have some good fighting with the rebel rascals that evening. “But come, my lads,” said he to his dragoons, “this cursed town has been a nest for rebels. Apply your matches and burn the damned hole.” The dragoons obeyed him after having for some time galloped through the streets, uttering the most horrid imprecations against the inhabitants, who were mostly women and children, for the majority of the men had been at Donegore, and were not yet returned. In a few minutes the town was emptied of these miserable inhabitants, terror driving them in all directions, over the surrounding country. O'Halloran and his companions had also started off. But the troopers having received some intimation concerning them, they were pursued. The fleetness of their horses, however, saved them all, except Porter, whose horse stumbled and threw him, in consequence of which he was taken. When O'Halloran and M`Cracken had reached Ballybolly hill, about two miles distant, perceiving that the pursuit had ceased, they slackened their pace, and turning round, perceived the town in flames. “Ah!” said M`Cracken, “what have not these villains to answer for?” “Regret is now useless,” replied O'Halloran, “but I am afraid that we also have some of this to answer for. But our motives were good; our judgments only were in error.” “Surely,” said M`Cracken “you do not repent your efforts in the cause of your country's freedom.” “I meant well for my country,” replied O'Halloran, “but my efforts have only encreased her chains. I wished to make her happy, and more prosperous, and I have contributed to make her more miserable and degraded!” M`Cracken only replied with a sigh; and in this tone of mind, each absorbed in his own reflections, they rode slowly and silently until they came to a small cottage on the verge of Agnew's hill. They stopped at the door, and a neat, cleanly looking, middle aged woman, with a child in her arms, opened it. She appeared to have been weeping, for the tears still shone in her eyes. On first seeing the gentlemen, she startled as if she apprehended some danger; but soon recognising O'Halloran, her fears vanished, and being asked if they could obtain some refreshment, she replied “Yes, and welcome; such as I have.” They now alighted and entered. Upon a small table, near a blazing turf fire, over which a teakettle was suspended, they found a large bible, lying open, on looking into which, O'Halloran's attention was arrested by the following consolatory passage, at the beginning of the 46th Psalm. “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled; though the mountains shake with the swellings thereof.” He read the passage aloud; and turning to M`Cracken, “I am not superstitious,” said he, “but really there is consolation here. Dependence on God is, indeed, the firmest rock on which to build hope, and the unlooked-for occurrence of this passage, appears to me something like an assurance that heavenly power will protect us from our enemies.” “Mr. O'Halloran,” replied the other, “you are surely not serious in laying such emphasis on any accidental incident? We must expect no miracles now-a-days; and I believe that the best way to preserve ourselves from our enemies is to keep out of their reach.” “I believe, however,” observed O'Halloran, “that whether out of their reach or in it, we require the protecting arm of Providence to accomplish our safety. I confess that from the time that we left the camp, until this moment, I felt much dispirited. I felt as if I had no support in my distress, no refuge to fly to from the vengeance of our pursuers; but this passage has, in an instant, dispelled my fears, or rather it has restored my courage, for it has reminded me that, come what will, I have an unchangeable friend, who will not desert me in my need.” M`Cracken, astonished at the seriousness of his companion, replied, “I hope, however, that, in relying on preternatural protection, you will not neglect the usual earthly means of safety, a proper concealment from your enemies.” “I will not neglect earthly means,” said O'Halloran, “for it is my duty not to neglect them; but I shall not, henceforth, be so solicitous about the result; for should my enemies find me, here,” said he, placing his finger on the passage, “here is my support.” The woman now modestly observed to O'Halloran, “Ah! sir, that is, indeed, a comfortable passage. I also, just before you came, derived great consolation from it; for I have been, both yesterday and to day, in great trouble; but this precious book has enabled me to support it. I have passed the time in reading the various promises which God makes to his children in affliction, and I have had my sorrows sweetened. But, gentlemen, as I find you have been at Donegore, may I ask you if there has been any blood shed? My husband left me yesterday to join the United Irishmen there?” “At what time of the day did your husband go,” inquired O'Halloran. “In the afternoon, Sir.” “Then” said he,” be comforted, for he is safe. There was blood shed at Antrim, but none at Donegore; and your husband did not depart in time to Vol. II. F have reached Antrim before all was over. You may expect him home this very evening, for the people assembled at Donegore, have voluntarily dispersed, after having stipulated with the government for a pardon. “O God! I thank thee, that my children are not yet fatherless!” she cried, falling on her knees. “Thou hast heard my prayer, and hast protected him. Make me thankful all the days of my life, for thou hast delivered me out of this great calamity.” She then rose with a countenance brightened with joy; but still serious. “Gentlemen,” said she, “you must excuse me; for really I could not refrain for returning instant thanks to the Author of all good, for this unlooked for mercy to me and mine.—But you must want refreshments. Shall I prepare you any?” They assented. She called aloud—“Paddy!” and a little boy of about ten years old appeared, whom she directed to lead the gentlemen's horses into the stable, and give them oats. The gentlemen seeing the boy so small, went to assist him. When they returned they found a comfortable meal prepared for them. During the repast, Mrs. M`Kinley, with a countenance expressive of some anxiety, requested to know if the pardon they had mentioned, extended to all who had been in arms on Donegore hill, for, said she, “you were there; and yet you speak of being in danger.” “The pardon was not granted to all,” replied O'Halloran; “but very few were excepted, and it was our fate to be among the unfortunate number. You may be assured, however, that your husband is included in it.” “Gentlemen,” said she, “I am sorry for your situation. In this remote place, however, you are in the meantime safe; and my husband will gladly contribute all in his power to your concealment. Poor man! he left me yesterday with a sore heart; but, he said, he must go, as his oath compelled him.” Shortly after tea was finished, little Paddy came running into the house, with intelligence that he saw his father coming, and then ran off with the fleetness of an arrow to meet him. Mrs. M`Kinley hastily got up, and was speedily in her husband's arms. “Thank God! thank God!” was all she could utter for some minutes, while her husband kissed off the tears of joy that trickled down her cheeks. He now perceived O'Halloran and his companion; and advancing respectfully towards them, welcomed them to his house. “Gentlemen,” said he, “you must be carefully concealed, for Claverill's dragoons are scouring the whole country. They have caught Porter; and had it not been for M`Claverty, they would have put him to death in Ballyclare; but he prevailed on them to send him to general Nugent, to be disposed of as the government may order. It was well for us all that M`Claverty came with us to Ballyclare, as they would otherwise have discredited, or at least disregarded, our having obtained pardon; and many would have fallen victims to heir ferocity. They had more than three-fourths of the town in flames, when he arrived; but by his exertions the remainder has been saved.” O'Halloran signified his intention, if M`Cracken would accompany him, to proceed, as soon as it should be dark, by unfrequented roads, to his own castle, in the neighbourhood of which, they might find means of concealment till an opportunity should offer of escaping to Scotland, whence they would easily obtain a conveyance to America. M`Cracken at first preferred taking the road to Slimiss mountain, where M`Cauley, Archer, and the other unpardoned insurgents had proposed to take refuge, as they believed that they might there, for a long time, elude the pursuit of the government; but the advantage of being near a sea-port, from which means might be found to escape to another country, appeared so inviting that he yielded to his friend's proposal. They accordingly set off as soon as it became dark, expecting to arrive at O'Halloran castle long before day break. When within two miles of the castle they were surprised to find the road, at the house of a man named Howley, guarded by armed persons in military uniform, on whom they had advanced before they were aware. They turned suddenly back, and endeavoured to escape at full flight, which they would both have done, had not a shot, fired at them by one of the military, wounded M`Cracken's horse. The animal immediately fell with his rider under him, who was instantly seized by three men who had followed in pursuit of them. “Who is your companion?” demanded they. “A gentleman,” he replied, “whom I pray heaven you may never discover.” “Where were you journeying to at this unseasonable hour?” was the next question. “To Larne,” was the reply. “We'll send you there to-morrow,” said one of them; “but to-night, you must be so good as to lodge with us. Culbert and Craig,” continued he, addressing two of his party who had come forward on horse back, “pursue the other runaway! They must be a couple of the damned rebels who are now flying from justice.” They obeyed him with all their speed; but O'Halloran was considerably in advance of them, and knew the country so well, that although their horses were fresh and swift, he finally escaped. However, as he was now obliged, if he continued on horseback, to keep the main road to Larne, which he wished to avoid, judging rightly that it would be the whole of the ensuing day beset with parties of military and royalists, in pursuit of their prey, he thought it best to abandon his horse, and seek safety on foot. He, therefore, turned into an avenue leading to a farm house, with the principles of whose owner he was acquainted; but not wishing to disturb the family, for fear of attracting his pursuers, he threw his saddle and bridle into a ditch, and turning his horse loose betook himself for shelter to one of the out houses. He had scarcely secreted himself when he heard the sound of his pursuers galloping rapidly past the avenue to the house. He, therefore, conceived that he was for the present safe; and endeavoured to compose himself to rest on some straw that he found on the floor. For a considerable time, the agitation of his mind, on account of M`Cracken, kept him awake; but the fatigue of his body, together with his having slept none for the two preceding nights, at length overcame him, and he fell into a slumber, from which he did not awake until he was startled by the entrance of a man in the morning. He arose, and found that the threshing floor of a barn had been his couch. He also found that the man whose entrance had aroused him, was the owner of the place. His name was Blair; and although he had not been active among the conspirators, his sentiments and feelings were known to be on their side. He conducted O'Halloran to the dwelling house, and ordered breakfast to be prepared for him in a private room. O'Halloran recounted to him the incidents which had brought him there, and requested to know by what accident Vol. ii. f 2 the military were stationed on the road at Howley's house. “They are a party of the Glenarm yeomanry,” said Blair; “and, I believe, it is for the purpose of making a parade of his loyalty that Howley has brought them to his house. The United Irishmen had taken him prisoner, in Glenarm, on the morning of the rising, and carried him to their camp on Belair hill, adjoining that town. The catholics from the northern part of the county, who disliked him on account of the officious discoveries he had made of their smuggling, by which he impoverished many of them, would have put him to death but for the opposition of their leaders. “The yeomen of the place and a few Scotch fencibles, forming the whole military force stationed there, took refuge from the people, in Lord Antrim's Castle. No bloodshed, as far as I can learn, took place, and on hearing this morning of the defeat at Antrim, the United men thought proper, spontaneously to disperse. Howley pretending great fear of assassination, obtained from the commander of the yeomanry a guard of twelve men, who escorted him home; and these men, whom from either excess or affectation of fear, he has kept as sentinels about his house, are those you encountered.” “Then M`Cracken is, indeed, among his enemies!” said O'Halloran, with a sigh. Towards the evening he was informed that M`Cracken had been sent forward to Carrickfergus, to be imprisoned in the county jail. Blair had gone himself to O'Halloran castle to inform Mrs. Brown and Ellen of the place of his concealment. In the evening, therefore, his sister visited him, the distance being little more than two miles. She told him that Ellen was in a state of dreadful anxiety for his safety; and that it was with great persuasion she was prevented from accompanying her to see him, being prevailed on to stay behind only from the consideration that her visit might excite suspicion, and lead to a discovery of his retreat. “The Recluse has been our only comforter,” continued Mrs. Brown. “He is a worthy, and a wise man; and has visited us frequently since you left us. When we proposed the Point Rock as the place of your concealment, `No,' said he, `Sir Geoffrey is acquainted with it, and it will unquestionably be searched before many days.' He then mentioned that he had an apartment in his subterraneous dwelling, in which he thinks you might be comfortably and safely concealed until a vessel can be provided to convey you to Scotland.” “That meets my own views exactly,” said O'Halloran. “In this country I never can be safe, and breathe the air in freedom. To Scotland I shall go, and thence, if the government still pursues me, I can find a ready passage to America.” As the vicinity of Howley, who with his twelve yeomen had become very active in hunting after the proscribed rebels, was considered peculiarly dangerous, with Blair's assistance, O'Halloran was that very night conveyed in safety to the Recluse's dwelling. His astonishment at the accommodations it afforded, and the furniture it contained, were strongly expressed; but the Recluse soon explained the matter. “It is now no time,” said he, “to be mysterious or reserved with you. I am not the poor destitute Sanders you have hitherto supposed me to be. I am your son-in-law, Francis Hamilton. I make the explanation now that you may know how much I am interested in your safety, and to satisfy you that, should your affairs take the worst possible turn, she, for whom you have hitherto displayed the tenderness and solicitude of a father, will not want a protector. It is true, I cannot as yet publicly acknowledge her as my daughter. The vengeance of the disappointed Sir Geoffrey, armed with the power of those laws I was so unfortunate as to offend, would be let loose without mercy upon me. But I can reside near her. I can watch over her, and render her all the effectual advice and assistance, that I could, if I enjoyed the privileges of an unoffending subject.” At this moment Ellen entered. “Oh! my grandfather!” she exclaimed, as she rushed into his arms. “God be praised, you are safe!” “Yes, my child, I am yet safe,” he replied, “but how long I shall be so, God only knows. I have no doubt that I have much persecution to suffer; for my enemies are inveterate, and will not be at rest until they effect my destruction. But, my daughter, whatever may now be my lot, I can bear it with resignation, since I shall not leave you destitute of parental protection. Your father has revealed himself to me; and I feel now that death has lost its sharpest sting. The hand of fate cannot now be so grievous, fall upon me in what manner it may. Very different are now my feelings and views respecting death from what they were when I left Donegore hill. Then, I could have braved that king of terrors as a soldier; now I can submit to his summons as a christian, who considers it as an invitation to a better country.” He then strained her to his bosom, and kissing her with parental affection, “May the God of Heaven bless thee,” he added, “and never leave thee destitute of a friend as sincerely solicitous for thy welfare as thy grandfather!”</field>

Ellen left her grandfather with her mind much relieved of its anxiety, but still labouring under the oppression of foreboding fears. The Recluse accompanied her to the castle. As it was a fine moonlight night, and as O'Halloran had retired to rest, he indulged himself, on his return to the glen, in a walk along the beach, to contemplate the great scenery of nature, and lose in the sublime feeling of its immensity and magnificence, the sense of all his earthly cares and sorrows. There was a perfect stillness in the air; not a leaf moved in the groves, nor a wave swelled on the sleeping waters. He looked to heaven, and beheld the vast extent of that space through which the moon seemed scarcely to move; he looked on that boundless expanse of ocean which commenced at his feet, and the greatness of Creation's Architect rushed forcibly upon his mind; and he could not help exclaiming in the words of inspiration, “Ah! what is man, that thou shouldst think of him? or the son of man, that thou shouldst regard him?” and applying the thought to his own situation and feelings, he continued: “What am I, or my friends? what are their sufferings or mine, that we should repine at them? An insect is trodden to death; it is of no consequence. Man also dies; of what importance is it? Short, indeed, are the insect's joys and sorrows; and of what duration are those of men, in the eyes of immortal beings to whom a thousand years are but a day? But man is also immortal; and the time will come when he shall wonder that he considered the pains or pleasures of this transitory existence worth a sigh of sorrow or a throb of exultation.” He was here interrupted by the appearance of a tall figure, coming along the beach, towards him. He looked at it for a moment with some surprise; and then proceeded to meet it, although, with all his philosophy, he was somewhat disconcerted; for it was a late hour, and he could not conceive why any single human being should be traversing there, at such a time. He stopped; but the figure continued to approach, although slowly. He now placed his back against a rock, the better to defend himself against the attack of some nocturnal marauder, or, if the object were really preternatural, to support himself during the interview which it evidently sought with him. At last it approached near enough to speak; and he at once recognised the voice and person of Peg Dornan. “I hae been watching for you” said she, “in the glen for mair than half an hoor. I'm just come wi' a' the speed my legs could carry me frae Larne to tell you, gin you ken if Mr. O'Halloran be here, or near han' this place, ye maun gar him get aff before the mornin', for Claverill's dragoons, wi' Sir Geoffrey at their head, will be here, an' they will herry up every pit and cave, an' hole an' neuk, to come at him; an' mair than that, Ellen maun also be ta'en oot o' the way, for Sir Geoffrey swears that he'll hae her noo, in spite o' a' the crappies in the country.” “How did you obtain this intelligence?” inquired the Recluse. “Why, sir, I went yesterday to the toon for news o' the folk that had come hame frae Donegore. Ye ken my sin Jock was there. I was smoking a blast, an' talking wi' him, quite blithe to see him, an' a' the lave hame again safe an' pardoned. Weel, thinks I, they're no' sic ill bodies, thae government folk, after a', gin yin tak's the richt way o' them. When, `what's that? mither,' quoth Jock; an' we baith ran to the door, an' saw the dragoons galloping doon the street wi' their drawn swords in their hands, till the very fire flew oot o' the pavement. They went to the schoolmaster's hoose; but he had cannily gi'en then the slip. Howsomever they set to wark, hacking an' hewin', an in a crack wrecked his hoose, an' ruined a' his guid plenishin', an' books, an' 'mathical instruments. Then, in less time than you could say Jack Robinson, they galloped to baith the ministers, an' took them an' thirteen or fourteen ithers prisoners. They had na' gane to the hill; so you see the hill folk, wha had the maist spirit, hae come the best aff. Nae doobt the prisoners will be a' hanged, or shot, whilk is amaist as bad.” “But tell me, Peg,” said the Recluse, “what you heard concerning O'Halloran?” “Why, that's what I'm comin' to,” she replied. “The dragoons cam' to the barracks wi' their prisoners; an' I followed doon to see them, an' I sune observed Claverill, an' Howley, an' Sir Geoffrey, talking together in a corner o' the yard. Thinks I, they're hatching some mischief; but deel be in my lugs, gin a dinna find it oot, an' gie warnin' o't. I cannily slipt ahint a door near whare they were standin', an' heard every word they said, for I was na' three feet frae them. They were plotting to catch Mr. O'Halloran in his castle the morn; or gin he should na be found there, to rummage the hale neighbourhood till they gat him. Sir Geoffrey tauld them that gin he were within five miles of the place he could ferret him oot, for there's no' a creek or cranny about the castle, where a cat could hide, but he said he was acquainted wi'—nor is there a den or cave in the neighbourhood but either Berwick or he could lead to it. `There's yin,' said he, `where the scoundrel kept me a prisoner twa or three weeks, which we maun search thoroughly; and if he is no' found there, we maun ransack, to its foundation, the cell o' an auld hypocritical beggar, wha lives like a hermit. But the girl, captain, we maun hae her secured; and you know whenever you want a magistrate to help you oot o' a scrape, I am at your command.” “May Heaven disappoint their wickedness,” said the Recluse. “But, Peg, we have no time to lose. I must go immediately to acquaint O'Halloran with his danger. In the meantime, tell Jemmy Hunter to be at my cell in half an hour; but you need not mention for what purpose, for there are more ears in the world than we think of when we are telling secrets.” Peg proceeded to obey his directions, which she did very discreetly. “What want you? Peg,” demanded Jemmy, after she had bawled several times through the window to him to arise. “Auld Sanders wants you fast,” she replied; “he's in a pinch, an' ye maun help him.” Jemmy required no more solicitation, and in a short time, he was at the cavern. The Recluse soon informed him of O'Halloran's danger, and required that he should assist in getting him off without delay. With his usual alacrity, Jemmy consented; observing, “You maunna tak' him farther frae the coast, for there are parties o' yeomen parading aboot and searching the hale country.” “Hasten then to the gully,” said the Recluse, “where the pleasure boat lies, and have it ready. O'Halloran and I shall follow you in a few minutes.” While Peg had been gone for Hunter, O'Halloran and the Recluse aware of the danger of removing farther into the interior, on account of the numerous scouting parties of military with which it was overrun, concerted the plan of retiring to Island Magee, the inhabitants of which were well disposed to the insurgent cause. To reach this island, or more properly, peninsula, they had only about three miles to sail across the bay which forms the entrance of Larne harbour, a task which would require them no long time to accomplish. O'Halloran was landed without accident at Brown's Bay on the peninsula, and was kindly received by a warm friend of the name of Barry, who immediately assigned a private apartment for his use. In less than two hours from their setting out, the Recluse and Hunter returned, and having, with Peg's assistance, removed out of the cavern whatever could excite suspicion of its inhabitant being any thing else than he seemed, to the beach, the whole was there safely buried in the sand. How to dispose of Ellen was the next consideration. As the leader of the dragoons could have no legal, or in any respect, justifiable plea for seizing her, all that was thought necessary for her protection, was to convey her and her aunt to the house of a Mr. Wilson, a neighbouring gentleman Vol. ii. g of an honourable and humane character, attached to the government; but who had not interfered with the political transactions of the times. This gentleman received them with great kindness, and when informed of the threatened depredation on the castle, he was shocked at its wantonness and barbarity, and ordered his servants to assist those of O'Halloran in removing to his house all the furniture and other articles of value they should have time to bring away. “De'il a hait they'll get noo,” said Jemmy Hunter, who, in company with a number of his neighbours, had also assisted in the transportation of O'Halloran's goods to a place of safety, as he finished loading the last cart. “De'il a hait they'll get noo, but the stane wa's, gin they should rage their sauls oot; an' they may owreset them if they please, though it would be a pity too to see the douce auld biggin battered to the yearth.” The Recluse had also taken care to have the horses, cattle, and almost every valuable kind of stock removed from the demesne, rightly judging that between the affected zeal of Howley, the inveterate revenge of Sir Geoffrey, and the wanton brutality of Claverill, nothing belonging to O'Halloran, on which it would be worth while to exhibit resentment, would escape destruction or pillage. At length, about nine o'clock in the morning, the glittering armour of the cavalry was seen by many an anxious spectator, glancing in the sun, as the troops gained the summit of a rising ground about a mile and a half distant. The cavalry then with a quickened pace rode down the descending road, until they again disappeared. In a few minutes they ascended the last hill which obstructed their view of the castle; then continuing on at full speed, they halted not until they arrived at its gate. “Let two men guard every out-let,” said Claverill. This being done, the whole troop, to the number of forty, occupied the yard. Not a sound but such as was made by themselves had they yet heard. “Why, all is as quiet here as in a desart,” said Claverill. “I believe, in my soul, that the people within, care no more about our visit, than if we were a drove of sheep. Sergeant Duff! advance with twelve men, force your entrance, and seize the rebel if he is to be found in the inside of these walls.” A thick massive door was thrown open by Duff's men without resistance; and they proceeded with drawn sabres through a large square hall, from whence they ascended a long flight of stone stairs, which winded to the top of the castle, interrupted only by a landing place at each floor. At the first landing place, they divided, part entering a long passage communicating on each side with a range of apartments, while the remainder continued their ascent. But every where all was silence, emptiness, and desolation. At the suggestion of Sir Geoffrey, another party of six men was sent beneath to explore the cellars, while, with Berwick, and several others of his own servants, the knight followed the ascending party for the purpose of seizing and carrying off Ellen. In vain did he penetrate into every chamber and closet. No animated thing belonging to the castle was perceived by any of them, until the first ascending party had reached the garret, when two cats leaped from under an old bench, that had not been thought worth removing. One of them running across the steps of a dragoon, he stumbled, and fell with a great shock, and a greater oath; while the cat whose leg he had broken, gave at the same time a tremendous squall, which alarmed Howley, who was advancing behind, and who conceiving the noise to be occasioned by some persons making resistance, shouted: “Damn the rebels! kill every soul of them!” Immediately a dragoon with one stroke cut off the cat's head, roaring out at the same time: “By G—d! sir, the other has escaped!” Claverill at this moment coming to the top of the stairs, and labouring under the same mistake as Howley, who had kept back from fear, cried out, “You damn'd villain, you must find him then.” “By the Lord,” exclaimed one of the dragoons, “he has jumped out of the window, and is now, I suppose, fast sticking on the top of the roof.” “Run down, Andrews,” cried the Captain, who was convinced that none but O'Halloran himself could have taken such a desperate step, “run to the out side, and order him down, or blow his brains out. I'll give a guinea for his head.” “Yes, your honour,” said Andrews, “I'll fix him.” Down he ran, and seeing the poor cat perched on one corner of the roof, took so good an aim that he sent a bullet through its body. It instantly rolled down to the no small diversion of his barbarous companions. “That shot is worth a guinea,” said Andrews, and with his sabre severing the head from the body, he hastened in to claim his reward. By this time Claverill was apprized of his mistake; and he felt horribly chagrined, when, as the cat's head was presented to him, and the promised guinea demanded, the whole party burst into an incontrollable fit of laughter. “Damned villains!” cried he, “whom do you laugh at? But it was your confounded stupidity, Howley, in mistaking cats for rebels.” “My guinea, your honour!” said Andrews, putting his hand to his cap. “Begone, scoundrel!” cried Claverill, “no more impertinence here with your damned cats.” The story may be here interrupted for a moment, to state that while Claverill remained in that part of the country, he was known by no other name than that of the “Cat's Head;” and to this day, it continues proverbial in the neighbourhood, to say of a man who makes a ridiculous mistake, or a blundering bargain, that “he has given a guinea for a cat's head.” Irritated by this incident, and full of impatience at not having met with his prey, Claverill ordered the floors to be torn up, and the ceilings, petitions and wainscottings to be demolished, lest peradventure they might conceal a rebel. This work of destruction was vigorously commenced, and forty men boiling with resentment, because they were disappointed in their high flown expectations of rich plunder, soon completed it. Having satisfied themselves that there was no human being secreted in the castle, they proceeded to the out houses. “If there be any persons in these,” said Claverill, “we shall make speedy work of them; the flames shall drive them out.” In a few minutes the whole range of the stables, cow-houses, barns, coach-houses, &amp;c. were in one broad sheet of conflagration, to the great horror and consternation of hundreds of spectators, who from a distance beheld the scene. “Not a man, woman, or child” said Howley, to sergeant Duff, “is to be found on these premises.” “No, by Heavens!” replied Duff, “and what is worse, there is not so much as an old trencher to be plundered.” Having left this stately building, and all its offices, a complete wreck, the magnanimous party Vol. II. G 2 proceeded, under the guidance of Sir Geoffrey, to the Point cave, the scene of his late imprisonment. As, however, he was not acquainted with the secret of its entrance, a circumstance to which he had not before adverted, he went repeatedly round and over the rock, examining it in all directions, but to no purpose. “What,” exclaimed Claverill, losing all patience, “am I to be fooled here also? What a wise set of companions I have got? One mistakes cats for rebels; and another solid rocks for prisons. Damn such stupidity!” Sir Geoffrey insisted that the rock before them was hollow, and contained two or three apartments, appealing to Berwick as corroborative testimony. “Confound his testimony,” cried Claverill. “Have you not told me already that he will swear whatever you bid him.” Berwick, whose confinement in the rock had not been so rigid as his master's, had, once or twice, during its continuance, been permitted to walk, for exercise, along the beach, in company with a sentinel, and therefore had some faint knowledge of the machinery by which the entrance was opened and shut. He knew that the end of some rope or chain must be pulled on the outside, but where to find it he could not at once discover. At last he recollected that the sentinel always ascended to a particular prominence in the rock, previous to opening it, when they were to enter. He accordingly soon discovered the ring, and the party obtained admittance. Here they found some books, a large file of newspapers, and a great many of the official papers of the United Irishmen, which they eagerly seized as a prize to be forwarded to the government. “We have at last discovered the rebels' den,” said Claverill, “but the beasts are flown.” “We may yet find some of them, not far distant,” replied Sir Geoffrey.” They were afraid, I suppose, that as I knew of this place, I should lead you to it, and have therefore avoided it. But Berwick is acquainted with another cavity in the neighbourhood, which they may imagine to be a less suspicious refuge.” “Lead on then,” said Claverill, “for there is nothing more to be got here.” The squadron now proceeded to the Recluse's cell, a knowledge of which Berwick had acquired, when skulking in the neighbourhood, for an opportunity to carry off Ellen. There was no obstruction to their entrance, for the Recluse himself conducted them in, in order, that whatever suspicion they might have of his being accessary to the concealment of O'Halloran, might be removed. “My old buck!” said Claverill, “have you any rebels within?” “No, Sir; I never approved of rebellion.” “So far you were right, old hypocrite! but we cannot take your word for it.” “Enter then, and be satisfied, although, I believe, that to utter a falsehood would be as grievous to me in these rags as if I wore epaulets.” “You are a saucy dog,” said the captain; “but lead us in, and be thankful that we do not blanket your old bones.” The old man led them through his cell, and without reserve showed them every thing it contained. “All these are but little worth,” said he, “but an old man like me requires little.” “None of your preaching!” cried Claverill, “we shall search and begone.” They then raised the flooring, and drove their sabres into the roof and sides of the cave to ascertain whether there was a vacuity in which any person might be secreted. At length, finding that it was all vain labour, they withdrew; Claverill exclaiming—“Come along, boys, out of this damned hole. The five hundred pounds set on the old rebel's head will not, I perceive, be found here.” The party started away at full speed, their commander grumbling that he was both hungry and thirsty, not having obtained so much as a glass of whiskey on this unprofitable expedition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IX. The hunted chief at length is found, And in a loathsome prison bound; Where his fierce foes with hearts elate, Exult in his approaching fate. But many a thousand hearts deplore, As he already were no more. From friendship's breast burst frequent sighs; And tears flow fast from beauty's eyes. Irish Soothsayer. But while these riotous troops were cursing their ill luck, in not meeting with the proscribed chief, that unfortunate man was already in the hands of his enemies. We have mentioned his removal to the house of one Barry, in Island Magee, where his friends supposed that he was perfectly secure. But fate had ordered it otherwise, although neither the instrumentality nor the wishes of his entertainer, were to blame in the affair. As the inhabitants of the Island Magee had been deeply implicated in the rebellion, and as it was expected that many of the proscribed insurgents would seek concealment among them, for the convenience of getting off to another country, the commander of the garrison at Carrickfergus had sent a company of infantry to be quartered on them, for the purpose of detecting any such fugitives. As this company had only arrived the day previous to O'Halloran's taking refuge on the Island, its presence there was unknown both to him and his friends. From an expression of Claverill on leaving the Recluse's cell, the reader will have gathered, that government had offered a reward of five hundred pounds for his apprehension. This sum was to be paid to his captors; and to the person who should give such information as would lead to his capture, whether dead or alive, an equal reward was promised. This was enough to excite the cupidity of a certain tide-waiter, named Conly, a young fellow, who was on a nocturnal visit of courtship to one of Barry's maid servants, and was concealed in her chamber, at the very time O'Halloran arrived. The apartment allotted to him adjoined this chamber. Through a chink in the partition the gallant discovered who this unseasonable visiter was. From that moment avarice predominated over love in his bosom, and he resolved to lose no time in earning the five hundred pounds. He accordingly the next morning, gave his information to the commander of the troops on the Island, in consequence of which Barry's house was soon surrounded by about fifty soldiers. O'Halloran was demanded. He was denied to be present. But the doors were soon burst open, and the soldiers, conducted by the informer, entered, without stopping, the very room in which the object of their search was secreted. With great delicacy captain Dougal, their officer, exonerated Barry from the infamy of having betrayed him; and declared explicitly from whom he had received the information. O'Halloran was conveyed on horseback to the county jail, in company with the informer, for that wretch knew that unless he were so protected, his life would be sacrificed to the vengeance of the defeated party. When intelligence of O'Halloran's capture reached Larne, the disappointed Claverill was about setting off with the prisoners he had there seized, being seventeen in number, for Carrickfergus. On reaching the village of Ballycarry, Sir Geoffrey, who accompanied him, perceiving a lad of fourteen years of age, named Nelson, who has already been introduced into this work, and immediately remembering the injury he had done the lad's family, and their consequent antipathy to him, and also recalling to mind the attempt to assassinate him, in which he considered Nelson to have been concerned, although it was the lad's premature exclamation which gave him the alarm by which he avoided his fate, he determined on revenge. “Seize you young fellow,” said he to Claverill; “he lately attempted to murder me, and I have besides sufficient proof against him for being an active promoter of the rebellion.” Orders were accordingly given, and Nelson was seized and bound, and conveyed with the other captives to prison. It was towards the evening, when the Recluse heard of O'Halloran's misfortune. He felt the stroke severely; but he was not one of those whom grief deprives of energy. Now was the time for serviceable action; and he would not waste it in useless lamentation. He immediately sat down and wrote as follows to Edward Barrymore: “The crisis is at last arrived. The long anticipated calamity, to secure your co-operation in preventing which, from falling too heavily on us, I was first induced to solicit your confidence and friendship. “O'Halloran has this day been imprisoned for treasonable offences, alas! too notorious to be difficult of proof. His sentence is already certain. A court martial at Carrickfergus will, perhaps, in a few days, pronounce it. No time is to be lost in exerting your influence to save him, and should you be successful in your application for mercy, equal expedition is requisite in making the result known, for much time, we may be assured, will not intervene between the pronouncing of the sentence and its execution. “I send this, both for the sake of speed and certainty, with an extraordinary but faithful courier, whose zeal will outrun the post, and whose profession will obviate the interference of suspicion to occasion obstruction or delay. “I am too much agitated to give you particulars, or to make comments, even if time permitted. I know not whether Ellen has yet received information of the disaster. I dread the effect it will have on her, and must hasten to her support.” The courier being despatched with the necessary instructions, the Recluse hastened to Mr. Wilson's. The family had heard a report of O'Halloran's capture, but not being certain of its truth, they had not communicated it to Ellen or Mrs. Brown. The Recluse, whose real character was unknown to Mr. Wilson, entered in his hermit's habit. Ellen had seen him coming round the house, and ran to meet him. She led him into a chamber. “Have you yet heard from my grandfather?” she inquired, at the same time ejaculating, “What a providential escape he has had!” “My child” (he replied,) “I have heard from him, and I fear he is not yet secure from his enemies; but I have hopes that even if he were in their power he might be saved. He has many influential friends.” “If he were in their power” said she, “I should have no hope. He has been too conspicuously active against them. They thirst for his blood, and will not be satisfied without it.” “Child” he returned, “it is your duty not to distrust Providence. Even if the worst should take place, it is the will of him who disposes of all events, and we should submit without complaining.” “I trust I should submit even to his death without complaining,” she replied; “but I should not do it without feeling.” “Well then,” my child, “be resolute and resigned, for I fear that he is in danger. The place of his concealment has been discovered.” “Tell me, tell me all,” she exclaimed, the truth flashing on her mind, more from his manner than his words—“Is he in their hands?” “Not in the hands of his worst enemies, thank God. No Sir Geoffrey nor Claverill has captured him. Their malignant rancour and cruelty might have made short work of it.” “But he is taken, tell me plainly—he is taken?” cried Ellen, interrupting her father and catching him by the hand. He paused to make a reply. “Ah! it is over, then,” she exclaimed; and bursting into tears, she gave vent to the fulness of her grief without uttering a word for some minutes. She then lifted her swimming eyes towards Heaven, and spoke; “Alas! they will drag him to a violent death! Oh! God! support him in that last trial!” “Compose yourself my child,” said her father, “if you would not inflict infinitely more agony on my heart, than it at present bears!” “I will try to be composed,” she answered. “It is God's will, and I must submit. But where have they taken him? I shall go to him; I will soothe, I will comfort him. Ah! greatly now will he need a comforter; nor will I leave him, when doomed to die, until his soul be no longer an inhabitant of earth. Ah! his poor sister! what will become of her? He was her stay, and her pride. I will now see her and let her know her misfortune.” “It is right,” said the Recluse, “that she should know it. But remain here; I will bring her to you. You will support each other.” Vol. II. H It now occurred to the Recluse that Mrs. Brown was as yet ignorant of his relationship to Ellen, and that she would now require a friend to look up to for support in her affliction, over whom there should be no mystery, and in whom she could without reserve repose confidence. He therefore authorized his daughter to embrace the first opportunity that should offer of revealing his secret to her aunt, well knowing that it would be safe in her keeping. He then communicated to the old lady her niece's wish to see her. She followed him into her presence. On seeing Ellen in tears, “Alas! I perceive there is bad news,” said she. “Your resolution, my dear aunt!” replied Ellen, “is stronger than mine; and I hope you will bear with more christian calmness, the misfortunes of a brother, than I can of such a parent.” “What then, is my brother no more?” she exclaimed. “He is still alive,” said Ellen, “and, perhaps, his cause may not be so hopeless as we imagine. But he is a prisoner in the power of his enemies; and, alas! there is much to dread.” “This is, indeed, a heavy stroke,” said Mrs. Brown, bursting into tears, “but I have been long preparing for it; and am not taken by surprise. Oh, my child!” here she clasped Ellen round the neck.—“This indeed requires fortitude to bear. But dry up your tears. God will not desert us under this stroke. He will not leave us destitute! Oh my brother! he was indeed a kind brother; but I knew we must separate sometime. The Almighty alone regulates the time, and the manner of separation. It is our part to submit; we may grieve, but we must not repine.” Mrs. Wilson, who had received a confirmation of the report, now came to condole with her guests, and the Recluse took his leave. During the evening, Ellen had an opportunity of communicating his secret to her aunt. “I rejoice,” said the latter, “that your father lives; but it adds to my anxiety to know that he lives in a land of danger.” “But,” returned Ellen, startled at the idea, “he is safe, I hope, in his concealment.” “I hope so, child,” said her aunt, “but we must speak on this subject with caution, as there are too many who would be tempted by the reward offered for his apprehension, to betray him.” Ellen's fears now took the alarm. She put her finger to her lips in token of silence; and felt as if she feared that her very thoughts would expose her father to danger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. X. Rude scoundrel, dare you so insult that maiden! Your coward frame, I'll trample to the boards On which you stand; and prisoner as I am, By Heaven! I will avenge her, villain! Feel that, and let your ruffian spirit tremble. M`Carrocher. Accompanied by Mr. Wilson, Jemmy Hunter and two servants, Ellen and her aunt proceeded the next morning to visit O'Halloran. When they reached Carrickfergus, they were shocked at the multitude of prisoners with which it was crowded, the number of whom was every hour augmenting. The county jail was filled almost to suffocation, and it had become necessary for the military commanders, whose will now superseded all law, to appropriate not only the jail belonging to the town of Carrickfergus, which is a county in itself, but also to convert the fortress into a prison. O'Halloran was confined in the county of Antrim jail, in an apartment about twelve feet square, in which he had for companions in captivity, five of the prisoners from Larne, two of whom were presbyterian clergymen, and young Nelson. On the application of Mr. Wilson to the commander of the garrison, O'Halloran's friends procured an order for admission into his apartment during certain hours in the day, although such an indulgence was generally denied to the friends of the prisoners, on account of their being so very numerous. Ellen, who had never before been within the walls of a jail, was much shocked at the mixture of corruption, wretchedness, and wickedness which she now witnessed. She was accompanied only by her aunt and Mr. Wilson, Hunter and the servant not being included in their order for admission. On passing the outer gate, they found the yard into which it led, filled with soldiers, whose profane oaths and coarse jests, uttered with indelicate broadness, together with their familiar and impertinent looks, so intimidated Ellen, that had she not been supported by Mr. Wilson, she would have sunk under the impression, before she could have reached the flight of stone stairs which led to the principal door of the prison. Here they were shown into a long narrow gallery, at the further end of which, on the left side, was the room which contained O'Halloran and his fellow prisoners. The room contained no other furniture than one bed, one small table, and a few chairs, all of the most indifferent quality. O'Halloran and the two clergymen sat on the bed, and the other prisoners on chairs. They were all pinioned. As soon as Ellen perceived her grandfather, she rushed forward, and falling on his neck, without speaking a word, burst into tears. His sister at the same time caught one of his hands, and ejaculating, “Oh my brother!” wept also. He entreated them to be resigned, as he assured them he was, to whatever fate was in reserve for him. “For my sake,” said he, “endeavour to be courageous on this occasion; for I know of nothing that will tend so much to shake my fortitude as witnessing your distress.” “With the help of God,” replied his sister, “we will be resigned. But, oh, Henry! this a terrible blow—too terrible for the infirmity of our nature to bear, without grief, heart-rending grief.” Vol. II. H 2 At this moment, Claverill and Sir Geoffrey entered the room. When Ellen and her friends crossed the jail yard, Sir Geoffrey, who was conversing with Claverill and some other officers at a small distance from the gate, had observed them, and although he knew that the publicity of the place and the company that attended her, rendered it impossible for him to attempt any outrage on her person, he could not resist the desire he felt to follow her. An opportunity to be again in her presence, although it should be as an avowed enemy, was to him too great a luxury to be neglected. He, therefore, took Claverill aside; and desired him to accompany him into jail, and he would there shew him the only woman he ever considered a perfect beauty. “And you know,” said he, “that I ought to be a judge of this matter, for I have been a pretty general admirer of the sex.” “This is the lady, I suppose,” replied Claverill, “whom you expected to capture at the old castle yesterday; but, by Jupiter, she had better fortune; and I am glad of it, although her granddad is a rebel. But come along; I must see this beauty of the North. Yet, hark ye! you may blackguard and threaten the other sex as you please; but to ladies, especially handsome ones, he is unworthy of wearing breeches, who would give an insult, and of wearing a sword, damn me! who would tamely see one given.” Here he strutted big, and attempted to look very fierce. It must not be supposed, that this ruffian officer spoke these sentiments from any generous feeling towards the sex, or that he felt the least spark of that manly courage, the appearance of which he assumed; for in real danger, his conduct disgraced the king's livery; he was a mere paltroon. But like most other cowards, he was a perpetual and arrogant boaster wherever he had nothing to fear. He had, besides, more penetration than Sir Geoffrey; and knew that the surest mode of preserving that ascendancy which he had acquired over the redoubted knight, was to keep him in awe, by making him believe that he had to deal with a man of a very irritable and daring temper. He, therefore, frequently affected to be in a violent passion with his companion, when he only wished to terrify him into his purposes, or to perplex him for his diversion. He knew that Sir Geoffrey would not dare to resent this conduct; for, besides his effeminacy and natural cowardice, he held him in complete check by being the confident of many of his villanies, and by threatening, if ever he offended him, to expose them to the world. Sir Geoffrey was particularly afraid that in some angry humour, he would disclose the offer he had made him, when soliciting his assistance to seize Ellen, to prostitute his authority as a magistrate to his views, and to procure the testimony of Berwick and Rogers in support of any charge he might wish to substantiate against any of his enemies. On the other hand, Sir Geoffrey felt great mortification, and sometimes even displayed considerable impatience, under the domineering controul of his military confederate; but he was destitute of sufficient energy to break the shackles which bound him to submission. He, therefore, viewed Claverill as a hateful tormentor, with whose caprices and humours necessity at present obliged him to comply. Thus, as is uniformly the case with vicious friends, Claverill utterly despised his friend Sir Geoffrey, while Sir Geoffrey was in perpetual terror of his friend Claverill. On entering the room in which O'Halloran was confined, they found Ellen still weeping on his shoulder; and Mrs. Brown holding his right hand, in all the agony of affectionate distress. “'Fore Gad, Sir,” cried Claverill, addressing the prisoner, “I see you have got an addition to your company, and a damned agreeable one too. But I think, my old Donegore general, you would be better employed in psalm-singing, or in prayer-making, than in fondling this pretty girl, now when you are on the brink of hell; for you have a damnable account of rebellious sins to answer for when you get there.” “I am bound,” said O'Halloran, looking contemptuously on him, “otherwise, captive as I am, you dared not insult me or my grand child, in so wanton a manner.” “Hey day! You would still be a hero, I perceive,” returned Claverill—“I like to see so much metal in your gizzard, although, my old cock, we'll try to get it out of you in a few days by breaking your neck. Nugent, after he has hanged your eropped-eared comrades in Belfast, will be here, the day after to-morrow, and then we'll make short work of you. As to you,” turning to the Clergymen—“my pious parsons, you should exhort this old rebel to restrain his temper, for his soul's sake.” One of the clergymen, who was a man of spirit, replied, “Sir, over misfortune you may play the coward's part of triumphing, when you can do it with impunity. But do you suppose your general, of whom you have just spoken so insolently, will tolerate your unmanly conduct? Will he not, when we inform him of it, make you repent your having—” “By Heavens!” exclaimed Claverill, interrupting him. “I'd have you repent this audacity among your other crimes, as soon as possible. So to your psalm-singing, while you have breath, or the halter will soon choke your music. Come, Sir Geoffrey, let us leave the rascals. But first let us salute the ladies, by way of amends for the leetures we have received. Kiss you the old dame, and I'll kiss the young one. By Heaven!” said he, gazing licentiously at Ellen, “I must taste those rosy lips. It will be so sweet after such unpalatable lectures!” So saying he seized her round the waist, when O'Halloran, by a violent effort, broke the cord which tied his arms, and unexpectedly struck him a blow which laid him senseless on the floor. “By Jove! it was well done,” said M`Claverty, who had just entered the moment before, and unseen by Claverill, had witnessed the rudeness he had offered to Ellen. Had you not been before hand with me, Mr. O'Halloran, I should myself have knocked down the scoundrel.” Sir Geoffrey without waiting to ascertain which side M`Claverty took, had hastened to alarm the guard. M`Claverty suspecting his intention, after assisting Mr. Wilson to disarm Claverill, and to drag him out of the apartment, followed the knight, and perceiving him leading a file of soldiers across the yard, he desired the jailor to refuse them admittance. He then returned to the apartment, and receiving an accurate statement of the whole transaction from Wilson, he hastened to communicate it to the commander of the garrison. That officer said he was aware of the outrageous disposition of Claverill, and would prevent him from visiting the jail until these prisoners should be disposed of. “But he may repeat his outrages on the ladies in other places besides the jail,” observed M`Claverty. “I shall let him know” said the officer, “that they are under my protection, while they remain in Carrickfergus; and that, if he insults them, it shall be at his peril.” M`Claverty having obtained an order for the guard not to interfere with what had taken place, returned to the prison with intelligence of what he had done. He then offered to accompany the ladies to the inn, in order to show the military that he would defend them from any unwarrantable liberties. At the inn, he candidly told them that he had little expectation of any favour being extended to the prisoners, none of them being entitled to the conditions of the surrender at Donegore. He added that the system of intimidation was still persisted in by the Irish cabinet; and that it was now more strictly enforced in consequence of the excesses committed by the rebels in the South. “Letters were received yesterday,” said he, “from the secretary's office, ordering speedy examples to be made of the rebel leaders. In consequence of which, M`Cracken, Porter, and one Story were to be executed in Belfast. The court martial for the trial of the prisoners here will commence its sittings the day after to-morrow. Who will be the first to suffer, I cannot tell; but, ladies,” he continued, “I trust you will keep up your spirits, and not dishearten your unfortunate friends on this trying occasion. Perhaps it would be better for them and you both that you should be absent from a scene, the solemnity and horror of which, you may not be able to support.” “I wish indeed that Ellen would return home,” said Mrs. Brown. “She is here exposed to dangers from which I am exempted. Besides her inexperience of affliction, will render her less capable of bearing its presence. For me, I must stay to support and comfort my brother; and, I trust, God will give me strength to do so until the last scene shall be closed.” “Ah! my aunt,” replied Ellen, “do you think I have no experience in affliction? Did I not lose my mother just when I began to know her value. Did I suffer nothing from a man whose violence and hatred we now all experience. And have I not for a long time past been preparing my mind for the approaching catastrophe? No; I cannot leave you in this hour of tribulation. Desire me not to go; and whatever I may feel, I shall endeavour to confine to my own breast. As to personal danger, the friendship of these gentlemen, and the order of the governor will, I should think, be ample protection from any.” “Well,” said M`Claverty, “if you will stay, I shall take care, as much as lies in my power, to provide for your safety. Mr. Wilson, I suppose, will remain with you.” “No consideration” replied Mr. Wilson, “will induce me to part with them, while they desire to remain; neither will I, in a matter which so nearly concerns them, urge them to relinquish that desire.” “You are perhaps right,” said M`Claverty. “In the meantime, my friends, I must take my leave, and may heaven support you through your misfortunes, and grant us soon to see better times.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XI. The court convenes, the awful tribunal, Which knows no statutes but its caprices. Alas! for those whose breath of life dep ends, On its decisions! — — a few short throbs 'tis o'er! The Court Martial. The day for proceeding with the trials now arrived. The martial tribunal was organized, and assumed its functions, in the county court-house. O'Halloran, and the prisoners who occupied the same apartment with him, were the first ordered to the bar, and the trial of young Nelson was the first proceeded on, not so much to gratify his accuser, Sir Geoffrey, as to prove to the other prisoners, that, if one of his tender age could not be spared, they had no room to expect mercy. He was charged with “joining others in an attempt to assassinate Sir Geoffrey Carebrow some weeks previous to the insurrection; and also with having, in the morning of the insurrection, in company with some other rebels, forced into the dwelling house of the said Sir Geoffrey, and seizing certain of his male servants, compelled them, under peril of their lives, to proceed in the rebel ranks, to the encampment at Donegore.” The first charge was positively sworn to by Sir Geoffrey himself, and the second by Tim Rogers, his bailiff. No defence being made, he was pronounced guilty. The president then addressed him, descanting on the enormous character of his crimes. “Wickedness,” said he, “unfortunate boy, must be engrained in your very nature; since at such an early age, it has broken out with so much ferocity. In mercy to your country, you should be cut off; for if your evil disposition were to increase with your years, horrible indeed would be their effects on society. Still we shall spare your life, on condition of your entering the army, where you will be taught to behave better, if you inform us who were your accomplices in the attempt to murder Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, and who instigated you to threaten and force his servants into the rebellion.” “I never attempted to murder Sir Geoffrey,” said the boy, “though I know who did. But I will not tell you, for you would then take two lives instead of one; for there were two of them; and I should then be guilty of murder to save myself. But I will not talk to you more, only to say that if you should cut me to inches, I will not inform against any one.” Every one present was struck with astonishment; and not a few with admiration, at this resolute answer from one so young; and when the sentence that he should the next day be taken to the house of his mother, and should be hanged by the neck until dead, in front thereof, was pronounced, a half stifled murmur of indignation burst from the spectators, and was perfectly audible over the whole court. He was then remanded to prison, and O'Halloran was put on his trial. His indictment contained a variety of charges, the principal of which were—“That in conjunction with a number of other traitors, he had negotiated with the enemies of the country for the purpose of procuring their assistance in overthrowing the established government, and substituting another in its stead; and that he had not only been active in seducing numbers of the people from their allegiance, and Vol. II. I in administering to them treasonable oaths, but had actually at the head of a numerous party of his deluded followers, levied war against the king, whereby the peace and tranquillity of the country was, and still is, very much disturbed, to the great destruction not only of the properties, but of the lives of his majesty's loyal subjects, &amp;c. &amp;c. Further, that he had in an illegal and felonious manner, by the aid of his fellow conspirators, seized and imprisoned certain of the peaceable and unoffending inhabitants of the country, for no other cause than their having resisted his attempts to seduce them into his traitorous association. And, that he had, with his own hand, cruelly murdered one of the officers of his majesty's army, for attempting, in the discharge of his duty, to suppress that rebellion which his wicked machinations had so effectually contributed to excite in the country.” To prove these charges, Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, Philip Berwick, and Anthony Burdolph, a private soldier belonging to the regiment lately commanded by the deceased colonel Lumly, were brought forward. The first deposed, “that he and the prisoner were at one time on an intimate footing, during which period the prisoner had made frequent attempts to prevail on him to join the society of the United Irishmen; that in consequence of his constant refusal to do so, he had caused him, and one of his servants, to be seized by some of that society, and imprisoned in a cave near his (the prisoner's) habitation, where they were confined until the breaking out of the rebellion; when they were carried to the rebel camp at Donegore, and regained their liberty only in consequence of the submission of the rebels assembled there. That while in their custody, he knew of various meetings between the prisoner and some French emissaries taking place in the cave in which he was confined, when they freely conversed on the aid the conspirators were to receive from France. That while he and the prisoner were on a friendly footing, he had lent the latter a large sum of money, without knowing to what use it was intended to be applied; that, while imprisoned in the cave, he discovered that it had gone to purchase arms and ammunition for the conspirators; and was informed that since he had shown himself an enemy to the conspirators, he should not receive payment. It was even told him, that he might think himself fortunate, if he did not lose his life as well as his money, for his enmity to their cause.” Berwick's testimony was merely corroborative of his master's—that of Burdolph, the soldier, went to prove that, “on the seventh instant, near Antrim, the prisoner, with a large broad-sword, struck the deponent's commander, colonel Lumly, a blow which knocked him off his horse; and in consequence of which he was found dead that same evening, near the spot where he fell, with a terrible fracture in his skull. This witness also swore that he saw the prisoner very active that day, leading on and encouraging the rebels to attack and destroy the king's troops, and that he fought more with the fury of a lion than the consideration of a man.” The evidence being closed, O'Halloran was called on for his defence. “Gentlemen,” said he, “as I know that my death is already determined on, to address you for the purpose of defending my life would be a mere waste of words; but part of the testimony you have heard, has gone further than merely to affect my life, it has gone to affect my character as an honest man. On this account, I should think it wrong to let it pass without animadversion. I am also anxious that my country should be acquainted with my real motives for taking so active and conspicuous a part in behalf of that cause for which I am to suffer; for erroneous impressions on this subject, impressions injurious to my reputation, may go abroad, which I now conceive it my duty to make some effort to prevent. Indeed, I acknowledge, that at this moment, however little I may be shaken by the terrors of death, I feel sensible on the point of character; for, if in the full enjoyment of health, competence, and security, I have often felt the pride of an unstained reputation; if I then congratulated myself on the possession of a character unslandered either in honour or morals, and until this hour, I believe, that I have been in this respect as fortunate as the majority of men, now, when I am on the verge of eternity, I must, and do feel that pride of character more intensely than ever, and am really anxious to leave behind me the good name that I have hitherto enjoyed. I must, and shall, therefore, endeavour to rescue it from the malicious misrepresentations of a false witness. “I may here remark that I bear that witness no ill-will for coming here to-day, to testify against my political conduct, for, I am aware that had he not done so, there are many others who could, and no doubt would, have furnished you with enough of information to justify you, according to your ideas on the subject, in dooming me to destruction. But it would, I believe, have been difficult to find any other who would have voluntarily and unnecessarily impeached the integrity of my private character. “When that witness first succeeded in gaining my confidence, I was a zealous United Irishmen. I was so, because I considered it my duty to my country, to join that portion of her people who had resolved to vindicate her rights and break those shackles of oppression with which strangers had long kept her in bondage. It is unnecessary to enter into a long detail of those grievances for the redress of which, after we had in vain repeatedly petitioned an unjust and unfeeling government, we resolved to take arms. It is sufficient to say that we felt them severely, and the circumstance of our risking so much for their removal is ample proof that we did so. To induce others to engage in a cause, in which I had thought it my own duty to embark. I could not conceive to be a crime; nay, I considered that the same obligation which bound me to to enter into the union of my countrymen, bound me to make all the exertions I could, to strengthen that union by increasing its adherents. Among others, I prevailed on Sir Geoffrey Carebrow to join us. But, as under our circumstances, there was no good in having numbers, without having them armed, and as Sir Geoffrey, who then professed great zeal for our cause, was known to be a money lender, I hesitated not to borrow a large sum from him on the security of my estate, for the purpose, then explicitly avowed to him, of purchasing arms and ammunition, a purpose which he seemed very zealous to promote. It is not true, therefore, that he was deceived concerning the intended appropriation of his money. “His assertion that I attempted to make his desertion of our cause, a plea for refusing him payment, is also unfounded. He must have uttered it here to day, only with the base and malicious intention of wounding me in a point, on which, he knows me to be sensible, that of my character for honour and personal integrity. I here, in the presence of this court, and on the word of a man who is shortly to meet his God, deny that I ever intended, much less expressed an intention, on any plea, whatever, to refuse refunding his money; and having Vol. II. I 2 made this solemn denial, I shall dismiss this part of his evidence, by leaving to his conscience the task of reconciling it to truth. “The deposition that I caused his imprisonment, is equally untrue. I knew nothing of it until he was brought to the place of his confinement. He himself knows too well the cause of it. It had no connexion with politics, nor were they United Irishmen who did it. Let him put his hand to his heart, and say if it was not done to prevent female innocence from being exposed to his villany? But it is a subject I shall leave unexplained, on account of her whom he would have destroyed. “With respect to the testimony of his servant, he has only repeated that given by the master. I strongly suspect he has obeyed his instructions in so doing, and the same remarks will apply to both. I shall only make this additional one, that as the servant was the accomplice of his master in the frustrated outrage against innocence to which I have alluded, it is not surprising that he should be capable of assisting him in the perjury of this day. “Against the evidence of the soldier I have nothing to say; but of the charge in the indictment, founded on a part of this evidence, I must complain. I was at the battle of Antrim; I did meet Colonel Lumly arm to arm, and I met a brave man. We fought, for we were arrayed on different sides; and I was victorious. My success may have been his death, as his success might have been mine; but this is the first time, I ever heard the destruction of an enemy, in the heat of an open battle, in which thousands are engaged on both sides, stigmatized by the harsh epithet of murder. What! is there a gentleman in that box, who after he had fought zealously, and contributed by the work of his own hands to the discomfiture of his enemy, would tamely assent to the propriety of being called a murderer! Surely to soldiers, it is unnecessary to enlarge on the wide distinction between a murderer and a victor. The common sense of mankind has long decided on the subject; and the cruel application of the former epithet to me, must only have proceeded from a disingenuous and overstrained affectation of zeal against the cause for which I fought. “The merits of that cause have long, and will long be a disputed subject. I shall not, therefore, enter on it. It is sufficient justification of my conduct, to my own conscience, that I believe the cause to be righteous; and that it was my duty to lend it my support. With respect to the views of such of my unfortunate coadjutors, as were active in this disasterous attempt to emancipate our country, so far as I am acquainted with them, they were directed only to her benefit. If they had any sinister views of ambition or personal aggrandizement, or the introduction of any favourite national establishment, whether civil or religious, inimical to true liberty, I know nothing of them. What would have been their conduct had we been successful, I cannot say; but I can state what I believe would have been my own. I never should have consented to the establishment of a French influence in the government of this country. We solicited the aid of France in the struggle for our independence, but not at the price of permitting her government to infringe that independence. I believe that my colleagues were of the same mind with myself on this subject. In our conversations, we have often agreed in the sentiment, that if we must yield to a foreign connexion in matters of state, it should be a connexion with Britain, in preference to any other country.—The form of government I should have preferred, would have been a republic of the democratical kind; but so constituted, as while it allowed the people their just ascendancy in the national affairs, it would have afforded strength and energy sufficient to the executive for every useful purpose, whether external or internal. Should the attainment of this desirable species of government have been impracticable, the state of things that I would have next preferred, would have been British connexion without British authority. I should have no objection for the king of Great Britain to be our king, constitutionally limited, and without the power of appointing any foreigner our viceroy, if it were found that such a state of things would be necessary to the preservation of peace between the two countries. “The United Irishmen have been charged with the intention of establishing the Catholic as the national religion. Whatever dispositions of the kind they may have lately evinced in the South, it is absurd to suppose that in the North, where nine-tenths of their number were Presbyterians, they should have ever meditated such a design. We never talked of a national religious establishment. The general understanding was, that on this subject, all men should be as free as the Creator made them. Should uncontrollable events, however, have occasioned the reverse to take place; should the absurd and inhuman doctrine of extirpating heresy, have again became the fashion of the day, I would have withdrawn from my ill-fated country, and lamented her delusion, conscious, at the same time, that I had done my duty towards her, in assisting her to throw off that yoke of foreign oppression, whose weight had bowed her to the dust. “But it is now over. She is destined longer to wear the chains; and I fear that they will be more firmly than ever rivetted around her. Every prospect of deliverance from her evil destiny, is now far distant. Long, long will it be ere she shall lift her head among the nations, proud and independent as she ought to be. But although I expect not her independence, yet, if I could hope that her stronger and victorious neighbour would treat her with that kindness and justice which true policy would dictate, I should die satisfied, for she might then be prosperous and happy as a British island, although she should never be great and glorious as an Irish nation. “Now, gentlemen! you have heard my sentiments, and know the motives that actuated me during the late unfortunate transactions. It only remains for you to do your duty according as your consciences may prescribe. I shall submit to your decision without murmuring; and, I hope, without weakness. About nine months ago, the illustrious Orr stood to receive his doom on the very spot on which I now stand to receive mine. Here he displayed a firmness which I shall try to imitate; and at this moment his beatified spirit is not unobservant of the scene that passes here. Glorious martyr of oppression! when thou sawest thy country enslaved, thou couldst not look on and be idle; and for thy love to her, to this place thou wert dragged, and doomed to that fate, which I am now, like thee, ready to receive. Oh! that he whose mighty aid sustained thee in the day of thy suffering, may also sustain me!” After a short address from the president, the court in a few minutes, produced its verdict of “Guilty of all the charges except that of murder.” The president now rose to pronounce the sentence of death. “Mistaken, and ill-fated man,” said he to the prisoner, “it is now my fate to deliver the opinion of this court, and pronounce according to its award, the awful words that shall cut short your earthly existence. Before performing this duty, it may not be improper to say a few words on the fallacy of those doctrines which hurried you into the commission of the treasons for which you are to suffer. Your infatuated imagination has been carried away by the theories of a new race of visionary philosophers, whose notions of government are as inapplicable to the proper regulation of a human community, as the means they have resorted to in making the experiment, have been destructive of human happiness. Men who know less of human nature than you, men less capable of reasoning on the nature of their passions and interests, and less aware of the necessity of governing and restraining them, for the safety and benefit of society, might have been excusable in becoming deluded by the fascinating, but absurd doctrine, of absolute liberty and equality. But you, from your education and opportunities of knowing, can have no apology. What subordination to the laws of a country can be expected from the uninformed minds, and ill-regulated passions of the peasantry, when such men as you, to whom they naturally look for an example, teach them that there is virtue in resisting, even unto blood, every regulation of which they do not happen to approve. Such men as you cannot but perceive, that in a great community, consisting of many millions of individuals, and containing many different interests in direct opposition to each other, difference of sentiments on even the most evidently useful measures of government will often arise, for every mind as well as every interest, has its own mode of viewing such things. Would not then the establishment of your disorganizing doctrines be a source of endless calamity to our age; would it not make the state of civilization, laws, and government, a more wretched state than that of savage life itself. The best institutions that human wisdom ever framed, or ever will frame, for human happiness, will have opponents. Is it, therefore, proper that, whenever a portion of the community chooses to be dissatisfied with the existing state of things, they should take up arms and wade through bloodshed and destruction to enforce a change? Should not those who not only entertain, but propagate and act on such dangerous principles, be punished as enemies to social happiness. The peace and welfare of their fellowmen demand it. “That you, Henry O'Halloran, to the great detriment of your country, have been guilty of such offences, has been amply proved against you. This court has, therefore, awarded you a punishment, by which you are to atone for this guilt; and which it is my duty now to pronounce. You are to be taken to-morrow, to the place of your late residence, in sight of which you are to be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and the Lord have mercy upon your soul!” O'Halloran was then conveyed back to the prison, and the court adjourned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XII. — this is the bloodiest shame, The wildest savag'ry, the vilest stroke, That ever wall-eyed wrath, or staring rage, Presented to the ears of soft remorse. Shakespear. When Ellen and her aunt visited their unfortunate relative after his condemnation, they found him in an apartment separate from the other prisoners. He had requested that they would not be present at his trial, lest the horror with which they should hear his doom pronounced, should overpower them, and their distress tend to weaken his own fortitude. As they expected the result, they were not surprised, when informed of it. But when they visited him, the sad reality being now before them, they gave way to all the softness and affection of the female nature, and long and loudly wept beside him. While they were thus venting their grief, the Recluse, and the poet, M`Nelvin, entered the prison. They obtained this permission, by means of M`Claverty, who, on this occasion, exerted himself to procure for O'Halloran and his friends, every possible indulgence, and it was by his management that they now enjoyed the convenience of a separate apartment. After the first salutation, M`Nelvin became downcast and silent. The Recluse spoke some words of consolation; but his own agitation made him a bad comforter, and he soon also became silent. For some time the same gloom and silence pervaded the apartment, as if O'Halloran's soul had already taken its flight. He was himself by far the least agitated; and perceiving the faculties of his visiters to be absorbed in sorrow; “My friends,” said he, looking round with a cheerful countenance, “the muteness of your grief shows its intensity. But for my sake, I beg you will not give way to such weakness, otherwise I may not be able to support my own strength of mind. Indeed I cannot bear to see my friends in such affliction. But for what are you afflicted? Because one of your friends, who has been upwards of half a century in this world, is about to leave it for a better! Rather rejoice with me, that I shall so soon be released from all my sorrows and vexations. Is it the manner of this release that effects you? God has willed that it should take place in this manner; and will you offend him by repining? And what, after all, is there peculiarly distressing in this mode of changing existence? As to its suddenness, an apoplexy would be more so. As to the pain it inflicts no man should regard that. It is soon over; the torments of many diseases are far more excruciating, and infinitely more tedious. As to ignominy, there is none attending it, for this path to eternity, has been trodden by many virtuous and great men, whose memories are hallowed in the affections of all the wise and good of their species. It can be no disgrace for me, to tread the path that was formerly trod by Sidney and Russell, and latterly by Orr, and only yesterday by Porter and M`Cracken. Our enemies may indeed cut short the thread of our existence here, but they cannot deprive us of the esteem of our friends and countrymen when we are gone. These are comfortable considerations. But they are not the only considerations that support me under this dispensation. Here Vol. II. K is my grand support,” said he, lifting a small bible which lay on a table near him, and opening it; “here is the support with which God himself graciously furnished me, when a wanderer from Donegore, and driven to the very verge of despair. In the midst of my anguish, this consolatory passage was opened to me, in an hospitable cottage, and from that moment, my soul has never known despondency, or distrusted its Creator.” The Recluse now drew near him. “Forgive my weakness,” said he; “my mind is agitated from more causes than grief. Suspense tears it to pieces; but I must not disturb your serenity by communicating the cause of my anxiety.” “What!” said O'Halloran, with some alarm; “I trust you forebode no more misfortune to my grandchild! Oh! Ellen, my child, your exposed state alone causes me to feel uneasy. But to the care of that God, in whom I trust, I commend you; and you have near, dear, and vigilant friends, even in this world. But oh! never forget to repose your chief confidence in the protector you have in heaven.” The Recluse assured him that he knew of no evil threatening Ellen; that his suspense was occasioned by his entertaining hopes for him which he feared were likely to be disappointed. “If that be all,” replied O'Halloran, “you may cast aside your suspense. My hopes are sure, and will not deceive me, for they are fixed on Heaven.” A messenger now entered from the commander of the garrison, requesting to know if O'Halloran desired the society of a clergyman; and if so, to signify his commands on the subject, and they should be attended to. The attendance of one of his clerical fellow prisoners was requested, and obtained; the other being appointed to attend young Nelson. The ladies, and O'Halloran's other friends; now left him to the conversation of the clergyman, and withdrew to the inn. The next morning, they again visited him. He had enjoyed a good night's sleep; was very much refreshed, and somewhat more cheerful than on the preceding evening. “Now my sister,” said he to Mrs. Brown, “I do not wish you to accompany me to day. Let me bid you and Ellen a last adieu. After the pang of this separation, for I feel indeed a pang,” and the tears started into his eyes, “all my earthly cares will be over, and I shall have nothing to do but to die.” “We will accompany you part of the way,” said they. “I would rather not,” he replied; “your presence would remind me of earthly enjoyments; and I wish nothing at that period to attract my thoughts from Heaven.” “Well, then, Henry!” said Mrs. Brown, “farewell! In Heaven I hope, soon to meet you.” “Farewell! my sister. We shall meet there;” and he embraced her. “Now, thou daughter of my only child!” continued he, turning to Ellen, “the only offspring I leave in this world; thou hast long been the darling of my heart and the object of my care, farewell! I resign thee to the care of the Almighty. May his blessing forever rest on thee!” He then gave her a parting embrace, and her aunt and she, were led out of the room by Mr. Wilson and the Recluse. It was about eight o'clock; and they had scarcely reached the inn, when the sound of military music drew their attention. They looked from the windows and beheld a regiment of infantry marching from the castle towards the jail. Their hearts sank within them; for this was the commencement of the procession to the fatal spot. The regiment halted; and was drawn up before the jail. In a few minutes, they saw Nelson brought out, on a common farming car, surrounded by soldiers. His coffin was behind him, and a man who, as they were informed, was the executioner, sat on the other side of the vehicle. It stopped a few minutes in the middle of the street; when one of the clergymen before mentioned, placed himself along side of Nelson, with a bible in his hand. In a short time, another vehicle of the same sort, appeared. It contained O'Halloran, his coffin, and his clerical attendant. The ladies saw but one glimpse of it; for they could look no more. Their hearts became faint, their vision indistinct, and their heads swam dizzily, as they were removed from the appalling view. The heavy monotonous sound of the muffled drums, now beating time to the music of a dead march, informed them that the procession was departing on its fatal errand; and when the ladies had recovered sufficiently to look into the street, all was there as still and quiet as if nothing of importance had taken place. The procession having taken the road to Ballycarry, Mr. Wilson, and the ladies, attended by their servants and Jemmy Hunter, set off on another road, to avoid passing it, towards Larne. The military with their prisoners, halted about half a mile to the south of Ballycarry, (at the northern end of which village, stood the cabin in which Nelson's mother resided,) to give the soldiers time to form their ranks for marching through the village. The slow pace, the dead music, and the solemn beat, was again heard, and continued until the car on which Nelson was seated, came opposite his mother's door. The whole then stopped, and Nelson's mother suddenly fainted in the arms of her son. The executioner selected an ash tree, which grew near the end of the house, for the gallows. The car was soon drawn forward under the spreading branches of that tree, on which Nelson had often ascended in pastime, with all the sprightly playfulness and innocence of childhood. After the affecting ceremony of bidding farewell to several of his friends and playmates, who were permitted to approach him, the clergyman commenced divine worship by singing the forty-third psalm, in which Nelson and several of the by-standers joined. The clergyman then addressed the throne of heaven in a style so fervent and pathetic as to draw tears from the eyes of all present, not excepting the rough soldiers themselves. When he had finished, he asked the youthful victim, if he had any thing to communicate to the people, concerning his death. He replied that he had nothing more to say, than that he died innocent; for he had never murdered, nor intended to murder any one—that on the day of the rising, he had gone with a message to some of Sir Geoffrey's men, who were United Irishmen, to call them out; but that he had no arms with him, nor had he threatened any of them. That he was willing and ready to die; since he was sure that as he died innocent, he would go to heaven. The executioner now adjusted the rope, and asked him if he was ready. He replied that he only wished to see his mother once more, and then he would be ready. His mother was supported forward to him, for her distress rendered her unable to support herself. “Oh! my William! my lovely child!” exclaimclaimed she—“They murder thee,” she would have continued; but grief choaked her further utterance. “Mother!” said he, stooping to catch her in his arms, “wont you kiss me, and bless me before I die?” She raised her eyes, swimming in tears, and with an almost convulsive effort, clasped him to Vol. II. K 2 her bosom. “May the God of heaven bless thee, my dear son!” she cried; “thou wilt soon be with thy father, and I will soon follow thee.” “Amen,” replied the victim, and giving a sign to the executioner, his mother was removed, and the work of death proceeded on. It was soon finished amidst the agonizing horror, but profound silence of the assembled multitude. His body was then cut down, deposited in the coffin, and delivered, a melancholy, heart-rending present, to his disconsolate mother. Long, long will the maidens of the surrounding country, pause to drop a tear, as they pass the spot where the remains of this youthful martyr are deposited; and with swelling bosoms, adopt the language of Ireland's sweetest melodist, when they pathetically express their sorrows for his cruel fate. “Oh! breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade, Where cold and unhonoured, his relics are laid; Sad, silent, and dark, be the tears that we shed, As the night dew that falls on the grass o'er his head: But the night dew that falls, though in silence it weeps, Shall brighten with verdure, the grave where he sleeps, And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls, Shall long keep his memory green in our souls.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XIII. Down yonder hill with headlong flight, Swift as a swallow to the sight, With rapid course, he cuts the wind; Trees, fields, and hedges, roll behind; The thickening clouds of dust that rise, He leaves afar to seek the skies; For love, and friendship, urge his speed, A friend in need 's a friend indeed. Irish Soothsayer. After completing the foregoing tragedy, the military procession resumed its march toward the place appointed for accomplishing another. We have already mentioned, that Mr. Wilson and the ladies, for the purpose of avoiding this procession, had taken another road on their return homewards. It so happened, however, that they overtook it at the entrance of Larne where the two roads joined. “Oh! I shall see him again,” cried Ellen, “before he dies.” Mr. Wilson wished his party to avoid an interview, which, he said, would only cause additional distress to both parties. But Mrs. Brown cried out; “Since Providence has once more brought me so near my brother while he lives, I must see and speak with him.” The procession had stopped to form into ranks for marching through the town. During this interval, Mr. Wilson's carriage, containing himself and the ladies, drew forward to the car on which O'Halloran sat. Ellen, and her aunt, were soon in his arms, and the commanding officer had the politeness to postpone the march, until the first burst of their feelings subsiding, should allow them to separate. “My dear sister! my beloved daughter! do not go with us further.” O'Halloran was thus replying to their earnest entreaty to be permitted to remain with him to the last, when their attention was drawn to a man on horseback, who was galloping down the hill, behind them, at the most furious rate, with the dust, all rising in clouds around him, as he flew along. The commander was about to desire the ladies to resume their seats in the carriage, and to order the procession to proceed, when he perceived the advancing horseman. “It is, perhaps, some express,” said he to Mr. Wilson, with whom he had been conversing, “I shall delay a few minutes.” As soon as the horseman approached, “Oh! father, it is Edward Barrymore,” exclaimed Ellen. “He is come to see you die.” “Are you the commander of this party?” inquired the rider, who was indeed Edward, as he advanced hastily to Colonel Parker. “I am,” was the reply. “Then, your duty is over on this occasion,” said Edward, at the same time handing the colonel a letter signed by the Lord Lieutenant, accompanied with one from the governor of the fortress of Carrickfergus. “This, I am glad to see, is a conditional pardon for our prisoner,” said Colonel Parker. “You will also observe that I am to be his jailer, until the condition is complied with,” replied Edward. “What, sir, are you the Mr. Barrymore here mentioned?” “That is my name, sir.” “Why, you were zealous, indeed, to be the courier in this case.” “It was a desperate case; I could entrust no one else,” said Edward. “You were right,” returned Parker. “I respect your feelings, and shall for ever thank you for taking this disagreeable business off my hands. Guards, untie the prisoner! He is pardoned.” Shouts of joy arose, and continued to rend the air for many minutes, from an innumerable multitude of people of all descriptions. Edward, in the meantime, flew to his beloved, who on the first mention of pardon, almost fainted with excess of joy. He caught her gently by the arm; “Miss O'Halloran, I hope you know me?” said he. She turned round at the sound of the well known voice. “Yes, O yes! it is you who have saved my grandfather's life. Oh let me thus return you thanks,” and without considering what she was about to do, she attempted to throw herself on her knees before him. But he caught her in his arms; “No, my love!” he whispered, “God alone must be thanked in that posture.” “Oh! yes,” cried she, recovering her recollection, “I knew not what I was doing. But I shall thank God all the days of my life, for this kind providence.” Mrs. Brown now approached Edward. “Ah! Mr. Barrymore! what do we not owe you?” “I am already full repaid,” replied the youth, as he gently pressed Ellen's hand. Immediately a burning blush tinged her countenance; and sweet confusion sparkled in her eyes. Edward now handed the ladies into the carriage; and at Mr. Wilson's request took his seat along with them, that gentleman intending to go on foot with O'Halloran to the inn. The press of people, however, became so great round O'Halloran, every one anxious to congratulate him, that he was obliged to accept of Jemmy Hunter's kindness, who rode in among them, and offered him his horse. The crowd soon spontaneously formed into two parties; one of which followed O'Halloran with loud acclamations to the inn, while the other assembled round his deliverer. A vague and exaggerated story had got among them, that in his haste to bring the pardon from Dublin, he had killed four horses, and by means of such velocity alone had he been able to arrive in time to save O'Halloran. An immense concourse gathered around the carriage, in which he and the ladies were seated, and unharnessing the horses, drew them in triumph to the inn, while the women from the doors and windows of the houses, showered blessings on his head. The party remained at the inn only until another carriage was prepared, in which O'Halloran and Mr. Wilson proceeded to the residence of the latter, followed by Edward and the ladies, amidst the blessings and acclamations of thousands of joyful spectators. When the party, after arriving at Mr. Wilson's, had partaken of some refreshments, and their minds were somewhat composed after the high excitement of the day, O'Halloran requested a private interview with Edward. “It is a beautiful evening,” said he, “suppose we walk out to the shrubbery. Methinks the free enjoyment of woodland air, after my late confinement, will be refreshing and tranquillizing to my spirits.” The shrubbery led to a small cascade or linn, as it is called in that part of the country, to which an imperceptible continuation of their walk soon led them. This cascade, although small, was romantic. It was formed by a rivulet which ran through the shrubbery, and emitting itself at this place, rushed over the edge of a rocky precipice, about thirty feet high, into a wide dell, or low level lawn which spread towards the east, being bounded by the sea shore. This lawn was clothed with the deepest verdure, intermingled with myriads of wild flowers, with the stream formed by the waters of the cascade, rolling placidly through the midst of them. To the westward, the side by which our gentlemen approached this dell, it was bounded by a semicircular extension of a grass-covered bank, varying from twenty to thirty feet high, continued from each side of the cascade about half way round the small valley. On the brow of this bank, at a place where it declined with a gentle slope into the valley, the gentlemen sat down to contemplate the scene. The saffron hue of the sky indicated the setting sun behind them. Before them were to be dimly seen, the blue hills of Scotland rising like mist from the ocean at the extremity of the horizon. Beneath them a flock of sheep, and several cows, were enjoying the luxuriant herbage; while a thrush seemingly delighted with the tranquillity and beauty of the scene, expressed her joy in the full swelling rapturous melody, peculiar to that charming bird. “What a contrast” said O'Halloran, “is this holy scene, to that which I have so lately left! This pure wholesome air to the suffocating loathsome vapour inhaled by the unfortunate inmates of the prison from which I have just come! How different are my feelings now, from what they were at this time yesterday evening! From the windows of my prison, I then beheld the reflecting rays of the setting sun, as I supposed for the last time. I can now turn to that glorious luminary, and behold him setting once more, with the pleasurable sensation of hope, that I may yet many times view the same scene. It is only a few hours since I thought I should never again see the most splendid of all created objects, taking his diurnal farewell of my native hills. Oh! what do I not owe to your active friendship, to which, under Divine Providence, I must ascribe this unexpected happiness?” “In serving you,” replied Edward, “on this occasion, I have only discharged a debt which I owed you for my life; and we have now, to speak in mercantile language, only balanced accounts.” “Ah! sir,” exclaimed O'Halloran, “my subsequent harsh conduct, did more than cancel any claim I may have had on your gratitude for that service. You were my guest; I broke the laws of hospitality, and treacherously made you my prisoner. Yes, hurried away from the dictates of my better feelings, by an over anxious solicitude for the success of an unfortunate enterprise, I forgot the duty I owed to the sacred claim of a stranger under the protection of my roof. It was a crime, it was a foul crime, which, even in my then perverted state of mind, I could not altogether justify to my conscience, and which has since given me more uneasy feelings than any other event of my life. Your magnanimity now in preserving your persecutor, demands all the atonement in my power to make. To give this explanation of the state of my feelings towards you, I have asked your privacy. I need not entreat your forgiveness, for you have proven already that you have forgiven me; but I wish to convince you of my compunction for the injuries I have done you.” “I beg,” said Edward, “that you will not think of that affair. Even when it took place, I was conscious of your motives, and felt more for the pain which the struggle between your inclinations and your sense of duty occasioned you, than for the temporary confinement to which I was subjected.—And, O! sir, let me disclose my whole mind to you. I do not regret that captivity, for it resulted in one of the most pleasing events of my life. It brought an angel to unbar my prison doors; and proved to me that I was not indifferent to the loveliest of all created beings. I have said that you owe me nothing. But if I have nothing to demand from obligation, I have a precious gift to ask from kindness. I love Miss O'Halloran; the hopes of my life depend on her; consent that she shall be mine, and you will make me happy; refuse me, and you will render me indeed miserable.” “Refuse you!” cried O'Halloran; “No! not if I had an empire to give you with her;” and seizing Edward by both his hands, he continued, “O God, under whose canopy I now live, and breathe, make me grateful for thy goodness, in thus providing for the child of my heart a protector, and a lover so worthy of her. Young man, I shed tears, but they are tears of joy. I have shed none such, since the day that the wife of my affection, presented me with my only infant, and said `Behold our child!' I felt I was then a father, I blest the babe, and wept. I am still a father; that infant's child is still left to me; and can I but weep at this prospect of her happiness?—“But,” said he, suddenly changing his tone, as if some new suggestion had occurred to him, “Mr. Barrymore, are you not too precipitate in this matter? In the first impulse of delight at your proposal, I did not recollect that you have relations rich and powerful. Have they been consulted on the subject?” “I confess,” replied Edward, somewhat embarrassed with the question, “that I have not as yet spoken to them concerning it. Having no hopes of obtaining your consent, to the accomplishment of my wishes, since I had incurred your displeasure, Vol. ii. l and knowing that without your's, her's could not be obtained, I did not wish to acquaint my friends that I cherished views of happiness which had so little prospect of being realized.” “Then,” said O'Halloran, “there are obstacles I did not before perceive; and for the sake of my child's peace, I request that this affair shall not, for the present, be pushed farther.” `What obstacles!' cried Edward. “I cannot think that my father will oppose me in a point which so nearly concerns my welfare. He has no son but me. He is an affectionate father, and will not command me to be wretched. Besides, what objections can he have? Her beauty, her sweetness of disposition, her virtue, her connexions—” “Ah! stop,” cried O'Halloran, “there lies the obstacle. Her connexions. Will the powerful, the rich, the constitutional, the loyal family of the Barrymores degrade itself by an alliance with a traitor, a rebel, a ringleader of rebels, a man scarcely escaped from the gallows! No, sir; by strongly wishing for it, you may force yourself to expect it; but cool reason tells me that it cannot be.” “If I have any knowledge of my father's character,” replied Edward, “he has too liberal a mind to permit the errors of one individual to influence his estimation of another, however nearly they may be connected. Your being concerned in the late conspiracy, will not, in his eyes, diminish the worth of your granddaughter; nor, since you have done nothing unworthy of a man of honour and a gentleman, can any errors of a mere political nature, communicate any thing degrading to one, who is in herself all purity and excellence, and worthy of the best and noblest in the empire.” “You may think so, my young friend,” said O'Halloran; “but your relations will not look on her with your eyes. In the meantime, much as I should rejoice at your union with her, you must permit me to retract my assent, until it receives your father's; for unfortunate, poor and persecuted as I am, I am too proud to permit my child to be taken into a family, the head of which may look on her as unworthy of such a situation.” “Wherever Ellen is known,” said Edward, “she cannot be thought unworthy of any situation.” “But,” returned O'Halloran, “her grandfather's unworthiness may be reflected on her.” “Oh, sir,” said Edward, in a tone of entreaty, “I shall procure the approbation of my family. You will surely then be satisfied.” “Not only satisfied but rejoiced,” replied O'Halloran. “That they will yield to your wishes is my earnest prayer; but whether they yield or not, I shall ever be equally solicitous for your happiness as for her's to whom I should wish you united. For the present, however, we must drop the subject.” They arose; and ascending a small eminence on their way to the house, they perceived the country for several miles round, studded with bonfires; while the frequent shouts of mirth, that broke upon the air, proclaimed the joy of the people for O'Halloran's safety. “This is a brilliant and romantic, and must be to you a very gratifying scene,” observed Edward, “for it proves how much you are esteemed by these people.” “They are a kind people,” replied O'Halloran. “I only wish they were happier.” He heaved a sigh, and silence ensued, until they arrived at the house.</field>

'Tis not for mercy's sake, he grants the pardon, His heart ne'er warmed with such a god-like virtue; 'Tis for the credit; that it may be said He did, at least, one meritorious action, Ere he lost power, to yield some sweet'ning flavour To his loathed ministry: Or 'tis ambition, To use authority while yet he has it. Major Trip. Edward anxious for an interview with the Recluse, that very evening, after parting with O'Halloran, visited the cell before M'Nelvin had left it. “Ah! sir,” cried the Recluse, as soon as he perceived him, “never did the arrival of a mortal messenger yield more heartfelt delight than yours did to-day.” “My friends,” said Edward, addressing them both, “you have had sad times here since I left you. The storm is now, however, abated, and I trust in God that our country will never witness such another. Perhaps some lives may yet fall; but I have reason to think that the councils of the nation will soon be regulated on wiser and milder principles, for lord Camden is recalled, and the benign Cornwallis has by this time assumed the reigns of government.” “Cornwallis! did you say?” exclaimed the Recluse, hastily. “Yes, father, lord Cornwallis is now Lord Lieutenant.” “Thank heaven!” ejaculated the Recluse, “both for my country and for myself. The benevolent Cornwallis will restore my country to peace; and I shall be restored to my country. In a short time I shall no more tread my native soil as a disguised outlaw.” “You are then acquainted with lord Cornwallis,” asked Edward. “Yes,” said the Recluse. “I was his bosom friend, during his campaigns in America; and, on a certain occasion, had the felicity to save his life, for which he has never since ceased to remember me with gratitude.” “Through his means might you not long since have procured a reversal of your sentence?” asked Edward. “No, sir. On my return from America, he did apply for my pardon; but the influence of Sir Geoffrey Carebrow and others of his connexions, counteracted his exertions. I have never since permitted any application to be made. For some years I travelled on the continent; and having, at length, settled here and adopted this disguise, I became satisfied with my lot. As, however, late events have induced me to discover myself to a few friends, whose society I should be glad to enjoy without restraint, and one of my best friends has it now in his own power to remove the legal terrors that hang over me, I shall avail myself of the opportunity which is thus providentially afforded me, to become again an acknowledged member of society.” He then inquired of Edward at what time the courier he had despatched with the account of O'Halloran's capture arrived in Dublin. “On Wednesday evening,” replied Edward. “She was diligent and expeditious; but how did you think of such an extraordinary messenger?” “I could not, with safety,” said the Recluse, “have waited till the succeeding mail left Larne. Vol. II. L 2 Besides, I understand that the transportation of letters by mail has, since the troubles commenced, been very irregular, and I was well aware that a single day's delay might be fatal. I had some thoughts of sending James Hunter; but his unlucky adventure at Antrim, taught me that he was not one of the fittest people in the world for such an errand in such times. Peg Dornan appeared a much more suitable messenger. Her strength was equal to the task of travelling night and day for that distance; her zeal and perseverance I knew would be indefatigable; and her sex, manners, and attire, were the best passports she could carry to secure her an unsuspected and uninterrupted journey.” “The perseverance and zeal of Peg have fully equalled your expectations,” remarked Edward; “but I believe that her strength has not held out so well. I left her absolutely crippled with fatigue.” “Poor creature!” ejaculated M`Nelvin. “But she will be well attended to,” continued Edward; “and I make no doubt that such a constitution as her's will soon repair the damage it has sustained. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when she arrived. I was sitting with my friend, Charles Martin, in the drawing-room, when we heard a loud rapping at the street door. The butler happening to be in the hall, and thinking, perhaps, from the nature of the noise, that some distinguished personage wanted admittance, flew to open the door, but was so disappointed at seeing the uncouth figure which presented itself, that he would have instantly closed it again, had not Peg by main strength, half thrust herself into the hall. “I want to see Mr. Barrymore. I'm tauld he bides here, cried she. “You're tall enough, and impudent enough too; you hussey! exclaimed the butler. “I maun see him, she resumed; for the life o' a man, an' a guid man, depends on it; ye unceevil, ill-mannered tyke. “The altercation now induced me to look from the window, when I immediately recognised Peg. She was holding fast by the door frame, from which the man was endeavouring all in his power to disengage her, and thrust her into the street. I ordered him to desist, and ran down stairs to secure Peg a welcome reception. She gave me no time to speak, but taking your letter from her bosom, the moment she saw me— “Read that, sir, quoth she, and ride to Carrick, as fast as the best horse in this muckle toon can carry you, gin you wad save him. Heigh, sirs; but I'm tired!—but dinna wait, dinna wait—I have been owre lang a coming. “I was not too much absorbed in the contents of the letter to hear more. Having read it, I ran up stairs. “Martin! said I, see that woman below taken care of. These are horrible times! I must be off immediately to the Castle, and thence to the North. A friend's life is in danger. I have no time for explanation. “I then ordered Tom Mullins to follow me hastily with two horses to the Castle. I knew every minute was precious, and hastened onward at a pace which made the people stare as I passed them. When I reached the Castle, I found that his excellency had just set off for the Phœnix Park. I rushed out to follow him on foot, when I fortunately perceived Mullins advancing with the horses. I mounted one, and ordered him to wait for me, with the others, at the commencement of the northern road. Lord Camden had just reached the Phœ nix Lodge when I overtook him. Surprised to see me riding with such speed, he stopped till I approached. What is the matter, Barrymore, said he; I hope no fresh insurrection has broken out? “No, my lord, I replied, as I dismounted, I came to solicit your excellency in favour of a very dear friend, who is confined for treason, and even while we are speaking, may have sentence of death pronounced and executed on him, by the military in the north. “Is that all! said he, then let us walk in. I have of late received so many expresses about insurrections, and battles, and massacres, that I imagine every person who approaches me, to be the bearer of some such intelligence. But let us have a glass of wine, and then you can explain your wishes. “This comported little with my impatience; but I was obliged to submit. After we were seated; who is this friend of yours, he asked, that has got himself into captivity? “O'Halloran is his name, my lord. “What! the chief instrument of the rebellion in Ulster. I am glad of it. I expect that now we shall soon be able to reduce that province to order. “I came said I, to crave your excellency's pardon for this unfortunate man, whose excellent private character, would, if your excellency were acquainted with it, be sufficient to procure your forgiveness for his public errors. “How! Edward Barrymore, said he, are you become an advocate for a man who has been so fatally active in stirring up this horrible rebellion? a man whose destruction will be of more advantage to the country than that of any thousand rebels in it. “My lord! said I, this man once saved my life; and oh! if ever my friends or my family, have rendered your, or his majesty's government, any service, gratify me with an opportunity of repaying him the debt. The destruction of one individual, even of the most important description, will not add much to the success of the royal cause. Your leniency will attach him and all his friends to the existing authorities; and I, for my part, shall be bound to you by everlasting gratitude. “It cannot be, Edward; he replied. To extend absolute pardon to such an offender would afford an injudicious example of leniency, now when energy and wholesome severity are so much required. “Any thing, my lord, I replied, any thing short of death will be acceptable;—but if he be permitted to remain in the country, I shall be security for his good behaviour in any amount you choose to name. “You are very pressing, Edward, said he. Stay for dinner. I shall reflect on what is best to be done. You cannot, at any rate, despatch an express before the morning. “I shall be the express myself, my lord, I replied. The moment I obtain your excellency's order in his favour, I shall set off. In such emergency I cannot trust another. “You are indeed very zealous in this matter, said he. But I must reflect a little. I wish to oblige you; yet I must do my duty to the state. Dine with me, and if during the evening, I receive no more news of bloodshed, burnings, and murders, committed by those wretches, I may be in a better humour to spare one of their ringleaders. “I was obliged to comply. At about eight o'clock, an express arrived from the castle with a letter to his lordship. I trembled lest it might contain intelligence of a nature to irritate him against the insurgents, and frustrate my application. In a few minutes he laid the letter on the table. So you are to have a new viceroy, said he. Mr. Pitt don't think me enough of a soldier for these hot times. Cornwallis will arrive to-morrow to assume the government. He is a brave man; but too tender-hearted, I believe, when severity is requisite. I am glad, however, that he comes. The responsibility of conducting the country through these perplexing times, shall be taken off my hands. But, as to your affair, I must oblige you while I have the power; and in despite of all that has been said of the cruelty and harshness of my administration, I shall end it with an act of clemency. “He then retired to an adjoining chamber, and wrote the following letter, which he presented to me, saying, Read that, sir; I expect it will answer your purpose.” “To the Governor of the town and castle of Carrickfergus. “Phœnix Park, June 14, 1798. “Sir, being informed that you have the rebel chief, O'Halloran, in custody, I am induced, in consequence of some representations made to me in his favour, by a person well acquainted with him, to pardon his offence, on condition that he shall pay a fine to be assessed by you to any amount, not exceeding ten thousand pounds, which sum shall be appropriated to the relief of those royalists who have suffered from the rebellion in the county of Antrim. “The prisoner may be given over to the custody of the Hon. Edward Barrymore, who is chargeable with his safety until the fine be paid, and who will with any other person you may approve, enter into recognisance for his subsequent good behaviour. “CAMDEN.” “Having received this anxiously-desired document, I hastily expressed my acknowledgments, and withdrew. “I found Mullins waiting at the place appointed, and we proceeded onwards at a very rapid pace. At the instance, or rather the remonstrance of Mullins, we stopped at Swords to refresh the horses; during which interval, I endeavoured to relieve my impatience by writing to Charles Martin. I informed him of the cause of my hasty departure; and requested him to recommend Peg Dornan to the care of my friends, under the assurance that she had rendered me an important piece of service, while I was in the North last summer. “Martin had proposed to accompany me to my favourite shore as soon as the troubles should be over. I now requested him to follow me whenever circumstances would permit. I informed him that I should be found either at the Antrim Arms in Larne, or at O'Halloran castle, the residence of the Northern beauty I had so often described to him. Alas! said I, in concluding my letter, she is at this moment in great affliction. I figure to myself her luxuriant black hair all dishevelled, and flowing round her, as she buries her lovely face in the bosom of her unfortunate grandfather, who is the cause of her sorrows, in order to conceal the crystal tears that shine with heart-piercing lustre through her dark eye-lashes. The rosy hue of her cheeks, and the coral of her lips, are, perhaps, now pale. I cannot bear to dwell on the image that her distress at this moment presents to my mind. Loveliness in distress—and such loveliness as her's! Oh, Charles, I must quicken my pace, that I may have the supreme luxury of drying those tears, of removing those sorrows. I can write no more, my heart is too full. “We soon again proceeded on our journey, and reached Newry the following night. The horses being unable to go further at such a rapid rate, I, the next morning very early, procured a fresh one, and desiring Mullins to follow more leisurely with the others, set off alone, and reached Carrickfergus about eleven o'clock. You may imagine my consternation, when I was informed that O'Halloran had been taken away some hours before, to be executed at his own castle. The governor of the place, however, on reading the Lord Lieutenant's letter, observed that as the party would be detained sometime at Ballycarry, in putting Nelson to death, by taking the shorter road over the mountain, I might, by swift travelling, overtake it in time to prevent the catastrophe. Observing my horse to be greatly fatigued, he ordered out his own, and giving me a note to the commander of the party I was to pursue, `Dont spare the horse,' said he; `and may heaven prosper your journey!' “The horse seconded my impatience with great spirit, and you know the fortunate result.” “The hand of Providence has been remarkably manifest on this occasion,” said the Recluse. “How much reason have we to be thankful to the Great Ruler of the universe, for this signal deliverance! Two hours more would have rendered this pardon useless.” Edward now took leave of his friends, and returned to Mr. Wilson's.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XV. Methinks I see again Those gentle days renewed, that blessed our isle, Ere by this wasteful fury of division It desolated sunk. Thompson. The next day, while O'Halloran was employed in attending to congratulatory messages and visits from his friends, his servants assisted by a number of mechanics, commenced repairing the castle, that he might with as little delay as possible, return to his ancient residence. The Governor of Carrickfergus, having the discretionary power over the fine to be inflicted on him, fixed it at three thousand pounds, for which Edward, who transacted this business unknown to O'Halloran, immediately gave a draught on his Dublin banker. He then, with Mr. Wilson, became security to the amount of ten thousand pounds for their friend's future submission to the established government. When these two gentlemen went to Carrickfergus for the purpose of transacting these matters, which they did the day but one succeeding that on which Edward arrived with the pardon, they found the courts-martial still busied with the state trials. But these terminated before they left the place, by the arrival of a proclamation of a general amnesty issued by Lord Cornwallis in favour of all, except a few individuals therein named, who should within the term of six weeks from the date thereof, make their submission to the government. Of this merciful measure all the prisoners in Carrickfergus instantly availed themselves, and were set at liberty. Vol. II. M Edward and Mr. Wilson returned in company with a number of the prisoners, who had been taken from the neighbourhood of Larne. On hearing their expressions of sorrow of the rash step they had taken, and their protestations of gratitude to the new viceroy for his clemency, he was forcibly struck with this proof of the advantage of conciliation over coercion in securing the tranquillity of a country. Here he saw men whom Camden's oppressive policy had rendered bitter enemies to the government, now, in consequence of Cornwallis's clemency, manifesting by every expression of sincerity, their resolution to live and die its friends and supporters. “Ah!” thought he, “how happy it would be for society, if governments would hearken to the lesson taught by such an example! But pride and passion too often blind them to their own and their people's interests. All history proves the falsity of the barbarous doctrines of making public examples. The tyranny of the duke of Alva caused Spain to lose the Netherlands; the cruelty of the catholic Mary strengthened the protestant cause, and powerfully contributed to its permanent establishment in these countries; while the inhumanity of Jefferies, of Dalzel, and of Claverhouse, hurled from the throne, the family they attempted to support!”—Full of these reflections, and cheered with prospects of peace and prosperity which, under the auspices of the new viceroy, he perceived again to be dawning on his afflicted country, he approached the house of his companion, as yet the temporary residence of his Ellen, with light and joyous spirits. Here he had the pleasure to find the agreeable Miss Agnew, for whom he had contracted a sincere friendship. This young lady ran forward to him with an air of great liveliness; exclaiming, “welcome, Mr. Middleton!—O I forgot, Mr. Barrymore. But, indeed, I am so glad to see you that I cannot help blundering.” “My fair friend!” replied Edward, unthinkingly, “either of the names will be agreeable to me that shall be most acceptable to you.” “Upon my word,” she cried, “very gallant; a fair proposal, all at once, before one has time to bless one's self. But what, my tender Damon, if I accept neither of these names?” “I must then bear the misfortune, with as much fortitude as I may,” returned Edward, perceiving the turn she had gaily given to his expression. “Well! then, prepare to exert it,” said she, “for the old Scotch name of Agnew sounds so well to my ears, that I am determined to change it for no other; but if I had to bear the awkward Granuwale one of Halloran, I would soon adopt one of your's in its stead.” “I love my own country too well,” observed Ellen, to whom the last remark had been slyly directed, “to prefer either a Scotch or an English name to one of true Irish growth; and while my native appellation distinguishes me as an Irishwoman, I shall neither envy you your Scotch title, nor the gentleman both his English ones. But, Mr. Barrymore,” she continued, turning to Edward, “what news have you brought from Carrickfergus?” “I have brought good news,” he replied. “The state prisoners are all discharged in consequence of a general amnesty proclaimed by the new Lord Lieutenant. Mr. Wilson and I returned in company with some of those belonging to this neighbourhood.” “Heaven be praised! we shall yet see happy times,” exclaimed Ellen. “This is indeed pleasing intelligence,” said Mrs. Brown, who had entered the room, as Edward was relating it. Mr. Barrymore, you are always the bearer of good news. “Are you a mere man, or a magician?” asked Miss Agnew, looking him archly in the face. “Why, mad-cap! such an absurd question?” demanded Mrs. Brown. “Let the gentleman answer first,” said Miss Agnew. “I can scarcely tell,” he answered; “but I believe, I am enchanted here.” “That is but just,” cried the arch lady, “for I am sure you carry enchantment to every place else you visit. You must certainly have some power of necromancy about you. The sea cannot drown you; the strength of rocks cannot confine you; at the power of your words the chapletprize goes over the heads of all your competitors, and alights on your's. When your friends are assaulted, you drop as if from the clouds, to their assistance; the shades of night, or the intervention of hills, cannot conceal your enemies from your penetrating eye; nor protect them, though assisted by doors, and bolts, and guards, and pistols, from your vengeance. Neither is it in the power of steel to pierce you; for when the assassin lifts his arm, either an angel, or, what answers the same purpose, a saint, protects you from the blow. If your friend is in danger, from the distance of a hundred miles, you wing your flight, and in a few hours armies are dispersed before you, and your friend is rescued; or if you only visit the prisons where hundreds of captives are confined, whom you compassionate, the prison doors fly open, the prisoners' chains fall off, and they are set at liberty. O! sir, the African's ring had not more power over time and space, nor was his wonderful lamp more capable of surmounting all the obstacles of nature, and overcoming all the opposition of men, than your talismanic influence.” “What, a lecture on necromancy, I protest,” cried Mrs. Wilson, who had just entered. “Why, I believe, girl, you are really mad.” “She is only labouring under the delirium of a joyous fever!” said Ellen. “I am indeed in a delirium of joy” returned Miss Agnew, “to see all my friends so happy. But I have also spoken truth in my delirium. No one can deny that many miracles have been wrought in our favour by that conjuror from the South.” “If our fair enigmatical lecturer,” observed Edward, “labours under any malady, it is that of a warm heart, accompanied with a lively imagination, and an irresistible command over metaphorical ideas and expressions.” They were now summoned to dinner. Several gentlemen of the neighbourhood were of the party, and among others, their friend, M`Claverty. As soon as this gentleman perceived Edward, he appeared somewhat startled. “Sir,” said he, approaching him, “I think I have seen you before.” “Yes,” replied Edward, “You were then on an important duty.” “I remember having examined you rather roughly,” returned M`Claverty. “That is nothing,” said Edward. “Your duty required you to examine me. I was a stranger; and you were in pursuit of the perpetrators of a erime, of which, for aught you knew, I might have been guilty. I was a little peevish under your interrogatories at the time; but I afterwards blamed myself for being so foolish. I have since that time, heard enough of your character, to convince me, that your conduct did not proceed from either the pride or petulance of authority.” Vol. II. M 2 “Well I hope,” returned the magistrate, “that we shall be good friends on further acquaintance.” After an hospitable dinner, which, like every other dinner given by people of fortune, displayed all the luxuries of the season, the cloth was withdrawn; and the ladies soon following it, the gentlemen addressed themselves, like true Irishmen, to the conviviality of the social cup; and the time passed away in the enjoyment of much good humour and hilarity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVI. We may roam through this world like a child at a feast, Who but sips of a sweet, and then flies to the rest; And when pleasure begins to grow dull in the east, We may order our wings and be off to the west: But if hearts that feel, and eyes that smile, Are the dearest gifts that heaven supplies, We never need leave our own green isle, For sensitive hearts and sun-bright eyes. Moore. The principal gentlemen in the neighbourhood, now gave a routine of dinners and balls in testimony of their satisfaction at O'Halloran's escape from the dangers into which he had been involved, and of their respect for the high character he had supported through the trying scene. Edward and Ellen were, of course, always invited to these parties, and the easy urbanity, the respectful kindness, and cheerful politeness of the Northern Irish, made an indelible impression on Edward's mind in their favour. He the more zealously cherished this impression, because he had been taught to believe, that they were a race of stiff, plodding, narrow-minded, avaricious people, the descendants of Scotch adventurers, so dry, so inhospitable, and so selfish in their manners, that they scarcely deserved to be considered Irish. “How much have I been deceived,” said he, in a letter, written about this period, to a friend in Dublin, “in the character of these people? Are these the cunning Scotchmen, the bigotted, ignorant Presbyterians, whose study is to cheat, and whose business is to grow rich, that have been said to inhabit Ulster. They deserve a character the very reverse. Their peasantry have all the good nature, simplicity and kindness of Arcadians; their merchants and manufacturers possess all the honour and punctuality once said to be naturalized on the Exchange of London; and their nobility and gentry, all the high-spiritedness, gallantry, and generosity of the days of romance. These people are indeed Scottish in their industry and intelligence; but they are altogether Irish in their manners and feelings. I am in reality proud to call them my countrymen.” The industry and zeal of the workmen employed at O'Halloran castle, soon repaired the damages it had sustained; and, in a few weeks, the family were reinstated in the Hall of their ancestors. It is the custom in that part of the country, when a family removes from one dwelling to another, to assemble a large party of its friends and neighbours to an entertainment, called “heating the house.” By a man of O'Halloran's disposition, a custom of this kind could not be neglected; and as so many respectable people had of late shown him so much kindness, the party he invited was more than ordinarily numerous. After the usual entertainments of dinner, desert, tea, &amp;c. the party in the height of glee, mirth, and enjoyment, resorted to a large room, where flaming chandeliers gave an artificial day, and harps, violins, and flutes, poured an animating stream of lively sounds, to give motion to their flowing spirits in the buoyancy of the bounding dance. It was about an hour before this sprightly and exhilarating amusement commenced, that a messenger arrived with the following note to Edward: “Dear Barrymore—I have at length followed you. Excited by my ardent desire to see the peerless beauty, who could so completely subdue a heart which was impregnable to all the attacks of the Dublin fair, I eagerly embraced the first moment, in which I could, with propriety, undertake the journey. The day before I left the city, I waited on the Lord Lieutenant, with the letter you enclosed from the Recluse, who, I understand, is to be no longer a mendicant, but is to appear in society in his own proper character of Francis Hamilton, Esq. of Hamilton-hall, in the county of Tyrone. His excellency was much pleased to hear from him; and, without delay, not only granted to him his request, but wrote to him a long letter, which on finding I was about to take a Northern trip, he entrusted to my care. “Your favourite, Peg Dornan, had a pretty smart fever, and was unable to walk for nearly a couple of weeks: but she was in a convalescent state when I left Dublin, and as she was getting very home-sick, I suppose she will, in imitation of your humble servant, speedily honour the Northern folks with her presence. Your father informed me that he would send her in the stage. Both he and your mother have been as attentive to her as you could desire. “By means of lord Camden, your father has become acquainted with your intercession for the Insurgent Chief. He is pleased enough with your conduct in that affair, only he thought you might have made him your confidant. But I told him you had not time; which settled the point.—I will give you no more city news till I see you. Indeed I should not have given you so much in this way, but having to send you a letter, I could not properly do so without putting something in it, and news answered the purpose as well as any thing else. I shall only add that I am impatient to see the old chief, with the fame of whose exploits, the whole city rang for some days before I left it. “Yours, &amp;c. “CHARLES MARTIN.” Edward instantly acquainted O'Halloran with his friend's arrival. A messenger with an invitation to the Castle, was despatched for him; and he arrived just as the party had finished the first set of country dances. Charles Martin was a lively young man of the middle height, rather slender, with dark hair, and a glowing complexion. Though inferior to Edward in manly proportions, he was, on the whole, an interesting youth, gifted with the easy, affable, and polished manners of a gentleman. Edward was conversing with a group of ladies, consisting of Ellen, Miss Agnew, two Misses Simpsons, and a Miss Moore, who had just sat down from the dance, when Charles was announced. Edward hastened to meet him; and taking him to his own chamber, Charles was speedily transformed, from a hardy traveller, into a “gallant gay,” ready to wait on the fair, and join in the mirthful revelry of the evening. Before they entered the brilliant scene of hilarity, joy, and beauty, he stopped Edward near the door, where unseen they had a full view of the whole party. “Stay, Edward,” said he, “I, for a moment, wish to view at a distance, a constellation of charms, the splendor of whose beams, if too suddenly approached, might dazzle and confound me.” “Right,” said Edward. “Let me see if, among all the fair, you can single out she whom I hold fairest?” The young man's glance speedily traversed the whole room. At last, resting upon a group of ladies to the right, who were sitting in a kind of semicircle, “If your goddess be within those walls,” said he, “yonder she is, surrounded by her attendant nymphs;—the lady with the damask rose on her breast. I know her by the glowing descriptions you have so often given me. The sparkling brilliancy of her black eyes; her high and circular forehead, as smooth as ivory; her well formed Grecian nose; her rosy cheeks; and coral lips.— Ah! she smiles! No wonder you were enchanted. What an expression of heavenly things is there in that smile! See! her gauze handkerchief moves to one side.—Oh! what a sight is revealed! What snowy whiteness of skin—what delicate fullness— what gentle swellings mark that half concealed seat of tenderness and love's emotion!” “Hush!” cried Edward. “Profane not—you will turn me distracted!”— “I knew it,” replied the other, “and do not wonder that you have been overcome. Indeed, did I not know how that lovely object has already disposed of her heart, I could not answer for the safety of my own. But mark! who is the lady to the right of this high beauty? She who has just turned her face towards us? The lady with the green sash round her waist? Let me see; I can hardly describe her. She is a brunette—my favourite colour;—and the most becoming one, I protest, I ever saw. What simplicity and archness in the expression of her oval countenance! What ease and liveliness in her looks! What a well formed neck;—What a well formed waist!—In the name of all the Graces, Edward, who is she?” “She is the Miss Agnew I have so often mentioned,” replied Edward. “She is the greatest coquette in the company; and when she is in the humour, a considerable quiz; but one always overflowing with kindness and good nature.” “By Heaven! Edward,” exclaimed Charles, “you charm me. She is just such a one as I have vowed to love, if I could ever find. Serious beauty is too sublime for me. Give me life in my lady; a sprinkling of Attic salt to season her charms. No offence, Edward; I acknowledge your enchantress to be the more perfect beauty, according to the usual notions of such matters. But she is, perhaps, too exquisite for me. You are more highly gifted than you friend; and the eagle alone you know cap look at the sun without injury. Methinks I could feel more at home basking in the less resplendent beams of that little luminary whose countenance seems to say, “Here wit, and love's bewitching wiles, Unite with gay good humour's smiles.” “You see she makes me poetical. Hasten forward, and introduce me to the Circean group. I long for a nearer view.” “Check your rapture first,” said Edward; “and do not play the fool when we approach. Why, I believe your heart is already lost; your making poetry is an infallible symptom of such a misfortune.” “It is lost” replied Martin, “past redemption, unless you show me some fault in that lady; for I confess that I shall never see any myself. But, lead on. Give me the pleasure of an introduction. I hope to conduct myself so as not altogther to forfeit my claim to the possession of common sense.” They now advanced directly to the ladies. “Miss O'Halloran! this is my friend, Mr. Martin,” said Edward. Ellen rose, and with a smile extended her hand to him, saying, you are welcome, sir, to this part of the country. I hope so long as you remain here you will find it agreeable to your taste. She resumed her seat; and Edward introduced him to Miss Agnew, who, without rising, made an assenting motion with her head, and said in a somewhat fluttered voice, that she joined in the welcome her friend had given him. A nod from each of the other ladies, as they were severally named, returned by a bow from Martin, concluded the ceremony of the introduction. Martin was next made acquainted with the gentlemen, who, each of them, gave him a hearty Irishman's shake of the hand, in token of a cordial welcome to their society. A second country dance was now proposed. It was led off by M`Claverty and Ellen; while Edward followed with Miss Agnew for his partner, and Martin succeeded with the elder Miss Simpson. The whole set consisted of eighteen couple, who threaded the mazy rounds on the light fantastic toe, to the animating music of various instruments, with as much enjoyment as ever the inhabitants of this world experienced on such an occasion. “Why you have completely done me out,” said M`Claverty, wiping the perspiration from his brows with a handkerchief, after the set had broken up, to his fair partner, who appeared as free from fatigue as at the commencement. “An old half worn-out fellow like me, should never engage with so youthful and vigorous a partner.” “Why you have done better than I expected,” replied Ellen; for she did not indeed expect much agility from her partner, who was now nearly fifty years of age, and had not latterly been much accustomed to mingle in such active pastime. “I suppose so,” said he; “but twenty years ago, had you seen me, you would have both expected and found that I could have tired out the best of our youngsters here. But there is a time for all things; and I am now hanging between the sober methodical feelings of your grandfather, and the warm-impassioned throb of the young Barrymore, who, Vol. II. N I think is the best winded youth in the company. And now, my dear madam, since I have acted my part with the juniors, I must go and recover a calmer and graver mood, in more venerable, but certainly not more delightful society.” So saying, he joined a party of the elder gentlemen, who, in a recess at one end of the room, were enjoying themselves in the less fatiguing, less animating, but, to them, not less interesting amusement of the “Spoiled Fifteen.” The company (to employ a usual phrase,) enjoyed themselves to a late hour, and separated highly pleased with their entertainment, and congratulating themselves on having added one more happy evening to their lives.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVII. What mighty power adheres to certain names!— When written on a little slip of paper; They can convert it to a talisman. There is a magic in the very letters, To raise the humble, to debase the proud, To shield the weak, to overwhelm the mighty, To chain the conqueror to a desart rock, And from a hermit to produce a courtier.— Oh that such names were still the friends of virtue! M'Carrocher. The next morning Edward and Charles Martin called on the Recluse, with the Lord Lieutenant's letter. They found M'Nelvin with him; and both, especially the Recluse, seemed to be much dejected. “My friend,” said Edward, as he approached the latter, “I have taken the liberty of introducing into your habitation, a friend whom I believe you have never seen, but of whom you have often heard. This is the only son of your correspondent Sir Philip Martin. “I am happy to see your father's son,” said the Recluse to Charles. “You bear a near resemblance to what he was before my misfortunes began. Ah! you recall those days to my recollection, when your father and I were college class-mates. The same was our age, the same were our studies, the same were our pursuits, and nearly the same were our opinions and principles. But different, far different has been the tenor of our lives. His has been smooth, calm and unruffled; for he was never the victim of those fierce passions which have brought on my head the storms of misfortune.” “Your misfortunes, sir,” replied Martin, “are I believe now at an end; and, I hope, that my father and you, have, in the evening of your lives, a long period of tranquillity and happiness before you.” “My friends,” observed the Recluse, “I will never distrust the kindness of Providence. But you will pardon my present seriousness, when I inform you that I have received news of a melancholy nature. You know, Mr. Martin, that I never had a sister, and but only one brother; now I have neither.” “What!” interrupted Martin, “is Sir John Hamilton dead?” “Yes; and the manner of his death, is what, at present, so much afflicts me,” answered the Recluse. “M'Nelvin has just brought me a letter, which he received last night from the post office, written by your father, in which he mentions that my brother who had, as you know, never been married, and had for a number of years past become a perfect sot, and associated with none but jockies, huntsmen and profligates of every description, was found dead a few mornings since in a ditch at the road side, about two miles from his own house. There were no marks of violence on his person. His watch, his money, and every other article about him, remained undisturbed. But it was known that he left a neighbouring public house at a late hour the preceding night, in a high state of intoxication. These, and some other circumstances, induced the coroner's jury to return a verdict on the case, of “Death by drunkenness;” a death which I consider to be in no respect less horrible than suicide. Oh! I feel it awful to reflect that my only brother, who, however exceptionable his character might be in other respects, was always kind to me, should come to the termination of his existence in such a manner.” “Sir Francis Hamilton!” cried Martin, extending his hand to the Recluse, “permit me to address you by your proper title. You are now a free man. I hold the document in my hand which absolves you from the effects of your unfortunate duel, and restores you to society. May you long enjoy your freedom, friends and property!” M`Nelvin's eyes sparkled at this intelligence. “God Almighty be praised for this addition to his other signal mercies!” he ejaculated, while Sir Francis hastily glanced at the signature of the letter. “I expected this,” said he, from his excellency's friendship. “I see that it is his own hand writing.” “I sincerely congratulate you,” said Edward. This is a turn of Providence from which, I trust, will proceed many years of happiness to us all.” “But my poor brother!” said Sir Francis, his mind still full of his catastrophe. “O! that he had died a less sudden death!” “Sir,” said M`Nelvin, “in the midst of so many blessings, we ought not to repine, if the great Ruler of all, does not send them unmixed. His ways are inscrutable; his dispensations are frequently mysterious; but they never fail, in some shape, to redound to the advantage of his creatures. That your brother's death has answered some kind purpose of Providence both to himself and to others, it would be impious to doubt.” “My friend,” cried Sir Francis, catching M`Nelvin's hand, “your words to me have ever been wisdom. I shall endeavour to grieve no more. God has removed him in the way he thought best. His will be done.” It was proposed that Sir Francis should without delay, relinquish his disguise and resume his proper Vol. II. N 2 appearance and station in society. To this he agreed, adding that he had the means at hand, and should, in a few hours, meet them at the Castle, free, fearless and undisguised. Edward and Charles now left the cell, and with joyous hearts turned down the glen towards the shore; while M`Nelvin set off for Jemmy Hunter, in order to send him express to the sheriff of the county with information of the pardon his friend had received. Jemmy was soon on his journey; and that very evening returned with the following note from the sheriff, addressed to Sir Francis Hamilton: “Dear Sir—It is with great satisfaction that I acknowledge the receipt of your's of this morning, covering the commands of his excellency, the Lord Lieutenant, respecting you, which, of course, it is my duty, as well as my pleasure, to obey. I shall make the agreeable communication known without delay to all the justices of the peace, jailers, and other officers, whom it concerns, so that you will be in no danger of personal molestation; and may appear in public whenever you think proper. “I have the honour to be, &amp;c.” Edward and his friend having reached the beach, “Do you behold yon rock” said the former, “at the foot of the precipice to the right hand. It was from its summit, I first beheld the mistress of my heart.” “And it was there too,” observed Martin, “I understand, that you were kept in durance for about four months, without once seeing the light of the sun.” “But,” returned Edward, “it was there, I was more than compensated for that privation, by the light of her lovely countenance visiting me, and showing me the way to liberty.” “You are a happy man, I acknowledge,” said Martin. “O! that my sweet brunette were to render me such a service.” “It is remarkable,” observed Edward, “that we have been both doomed to loose our hearts in this bewitching country. After the warning I gave you of its Circean influence, I think you displayed but little prudence in venturing to visit it.” “Ah! my friend,” replied Martin, “I confess I am indeed caught. But I rejoice at it. If I am a captive, I have, at least, the grace to be content with my chains. Methinks I would not fly from my charmer, even if my flight were to deliver me from a rocky prison.” “Your's is the superlative of love, I admit,” said Edward. “I could wish we had the proof of its sincerity. But shall we explore the interior of the rock?” “Yes,” replied his friend; “I am full of curiosity to view that nest, in which so many ill-formed projects of rebellion have been hatched.”— “But, not so fast”—interrupted Edward. “I see our two enchantresses yonder. It will, methinks, be pleasanter to join them. On some other occasion, we may visit the curiosities of this rock.” As they walked towards the ladies, Martin observed, “Since you have the key to my feelings, Edward, you cannot but know that I am unhappy; for, I perceived that my little sly tempter looked rather askance on me last night. Whenever my eye caught her's she suddenly looked in another direction, and, as I imagined, attempted to appear sulky; and if her countenance was not too pretty to be ill-natured, I fear it would wear a perpetual gloom in my presence.” “Have courage,” said Edward; “you must have your day of trial as well as others. I underwent a long heart-burning season of suspense. I indured insults, threats, ran the risk of assassination, and suffered under a long deprivation of the light of day, before I became certain that my fair one loved me. My sufferings at length softened her, and she confessed”— They had now advanced within hearing of the ladies. After the first salutation, “If it will not be intrusion” said Edward, “we should wish to share the pleasure of your ramble.” “We do not intend going far,” replied Ellen. “We were just about returning when we saw you approaching.” “Could we prevail on you to extend your walk,” said Martin, looking timidly at Miss Agnew, “we should be much gratified.” A pause ensued, each lady expecting the other to reply. At length, Ellen said, “if our company could indeed be of any service to you, gentlemen, we should cheerfully afford it.” “I assure you, ladies!” replied Edward, “there can be no species of recreation which we would prefer to your company.” “Nor,” added Martin, fervently, “would we exchange that company for any other under the sun.” “You, Dublin gentlemen,” said Miss Agnew, “have a bold knack at complimenting. Is such language frequent in your city?” “I protest, Miss Agnew,” said Martin, with simplicity, “I only speak what I feel to be true.” “Ah! young man,” she returned, “you are now fallen from the sublime. I should like you to take another flight towards the sun—but no, the clouds will be high enough; for I should not wish you to be overcome with fatigue, if you are to be our companion when you descend.” “I am, indeed, too much overpowered by my present feelings to venture on any flight,” replied Martin. “Our presence is, perhaps, oppressive to you,” said she. “We had better, therefore, separate.” So saying, she affected to turn away from him, but with a smile of such sweet good nature as threw him totally off his guard. “Oh! no, Miss Agnew,” he exclaimed, “do not leave me until I lay my heart open before you.” “Lay your heart open before me!—what a sight it would be!” she exclaimed. “Why this must be another of your Dublin customs.” During this conversation, Edward and Ellen had proceeded some distance in advance of their friends, so that Martin perceived that he had an opportunity of expressing himself more freely and explicitly on the subject of his new born love. “I shall now speak plainly to you, my lovely banterer,” said he. “The language of feeling and of love is every where the same. It does not consist so much in the words, as in the manner and looks of the speaker. Ah! have you not perceived, from the confusion of my eyes, the agitation of my manner, that you have become too interesting to me, too essential to my happiness.”— “Sir,” said she, interrupting him, “this is strange discourse;—but we must follow our companions.” “Ah! let us imitate them too?” said he, “by loving each other.” “They know each other better than we do,” she replied, “and are consequently more excuseable in yielding to the impulse of mutual affection with which their virtues have inspired them.” While speaking this, she hastened so rapidly forward, that they had nearly overtaken their companions, before he had time to ask, “When I am better known, may I hope?” “Perhaps so,” was the only reply he received; but it was accompanied with a look that gave pleasure to his heart. Ellen, conscious that the state of her feelings were too well known to permit an over-strained reserve to appear natural, had without hesitation accepted her lover's arm as they walked forward. Her gentle pressure communicated a thrill of delight to his whole frame, and he could not help exclaiming—“Ah! life of my heart! when shall I have a legal and exclusive claim to call thee my own, and to support thee thus in our walks, careless of observation, in the face of the world?” “In that respect, I am not at my own disposal,” she replied. “My father must act for me, or rather his wisdom must show me how to act; but my father dares not now act openly; and I should very much question the propriety of giving away my hand, while he lives, unless he appeared publicly on the occasion, to sanction the deed.” “And publicly he will appear,” replied her lover. “His danger is over, and his disguise will be thrown off this very day. The new viceroy is his friend; and has reversed his outlawry.” “Oh, Edward, do you indeed speak the truth?” she exclaimed. “But why do I doubt? This consummates the blessings which Heaven has so graciously, so abundantly showered on us of late. Lead me to my father, that, in his presence, I may thank my God.” Miss Agnew, who had heard her last expression, was astonished at her fervency, but on learning the cause, she partook warmly of her joy, and earnestly joined in her thanksgiving. Edward now informed Ellen, that he expected her father had, by this time, thrown aside forever, his disguise; and that in his own proper person, he would very soon appear at the Castle to confirm the intelligence with his own lips. “Even at this moment, he may be there,” said he, “anxiously waiting to gladden the heart of his daughter with the certainty of his safety.” As the party approached the Castle, they were overtaken by M`Nelvin, in company with a stranger of a genteel appearance, who seemed somewhat beyond the middle age of life. He advanced towards them with a firm step and an air of courtesy, with a smile playing on his countenance, while M`Nelvin introduced him to them by the name of Sir Francis Hamilton. Ellen startled, supposing that it might be her uncle, of whose death she had not been informed. “Sir John Hamilton, I rather suppose,” said she. “No; I have made no mistake. Sir Francis is his name,” returned the poet. “Yes, my daughter,” exclaimed Sir Francis, “and I am thy father, the old Recluse, who have for six years been content to live as a hermit, because you were near him. He saw you all he wished you to be, and he was happy, although covered with the garb of poverty.” “You are indeed my father!” cried she. “That you are now safe, thank Heaven;—but how have you become Sir Francis Hamilton. Has the Lord Lieutenant also given you a title?” “No, my daughter. I have my title by inheritance. My brother, your uncle, is dead.” “Dead!” she exclaimed. “Yes,” replied her father. “He was a kind relative; and I cannot but feel much for his fate, it was so unexpected.” “But, I trust, he has gone to a better world,” said Ellen, heaving a sigh; “the same journey is destined for us all.” They soon arrived at the Castle, where O'Haloran and his sister being informed of the revolution in the affairs of the Recluse, partook of the general thankfulness; and the whole party enjoyed several days of more felicity than usually falls to the lot of mortals.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVIII. How joyed the bark her sides to lave! She leaned to the lee, and she girdled the wave; Loud murmured the ocean, with gulf and with growl, The seal swam aloof, and the dark sea-fowl; The pye-duck sought the depth of the main, And rose in the wheel of her wake again. Hogg. A FEW evenings after the foregoing incidents, Edward expressed a desire to view the celebrated cliffs called the “Gabbon Heughs,” being the only part of the Antrim coast which he had not formerly visited. The young ladies, Martin and O'Halloran, agreed to accompany him; and it was settled that they should set out after breakfast the next morning. An invitation in the meantime was sent to the eldest son of Mr. Wilson, a youth who was well accustomed to navigate the coast, to attend with his sister, a young girl scarcely fourteen, which was accepted. Two of O'Halloran's servants were also taken along for the purpose of managing the oars in case of a calm. The weather was as favourable as they could wish; and at the time they left the shore the sun had dispelled every cloud, and was ascending towards his meridian altitude in unveiled majesty. The water was smooth and glossy; for there had been no high winds for several days. A moderate and favourable breeze sprung up from the north-west, and filling their sails, soon blew them from the land. In about twenty minutes, they were opposite the mouth of Larne harbour, and perceived the ruins Vol. II. o of Old Fleet Castle, at about two miles distant, standing on the narrow stripe of land called the Curran, which projects from the bottom of the valley in which Larne is situated, into the harbour, which expands southward into a large lake, extending upwards of five miles, between the main land and the peninsula of Magee. Our party perceived the bosom of this lake to be studded with merchant vessels of various sizes, while numerous yachts, barges and fishing boats, plied in the strait between the Curran and the peninsula. They soon, however, doubled one of the points of the latter, and lost sight of this animating scene. They now passed rapidly along Brown's bay, at the eastern extremity of which O'Halloran informed them that there was to be seen one of those ancient monuments of superstition, called Rocking Stones, by the instrumentality of which, the druidical priests are said to have imposed on their followers, the belief that they possessed preternatural powers. The party stopped to examine this curiosity, and found it to consist of a prodigious rock, upwards of fifty tons weight, seated on two points so firmly as not to be displaced by the united strength of twenty horses, but so delicately poised as to be easily moved by the little finger of the gentlest lady of the party. “What think you of this?” said Edward to Sir Francis. “Do you suppose that this rock was placed here by human means?” “Tradition says so,” replied Sir Francis;” but tradition ever loves to ascribe wonders to our ancestors. It particularly delights to magnify their personal prowess; and, indeed, if we could believe that the raising and fixing of this extraordinary balance was the work of our forefathers, we must acknowledge that they were a wonderful race, every way equal to those giants in strength and stature, to whom popular opinion has ascribed the construction of the celebrated Causeway at the lower end of this county. But I have formed a theory concerning these moving rocks, which, indeed, ascribes their construction to human hands, but does not require that they should be larger or more powerful than our own. Respecting this one in particular, I can see nothing absurd or improbable in the supposition that some dexterous mechanical genius finding it favourably situated for his purpose, attempted, and succeeded in the attempt, to afford it the small capacity for motion, which it possesses, by removing obstructions in some places, and placing impediments in others. But that it was raised and fixed in its present situation by human means, is not to be credited, for even if our remote progenitors had possessed machinery sufficient to lift and adjust such an enormous weight, it would have been nearly impossible to have hit upon the proper adaptation of its axles and their corresponding grooves, at the first trial, and they must have had to lift and relift it an innumerable variety of times, before they could get it to fit.” “What learned disquisition is this?” said Miss Agnew, coming round to the side of the rock where Edward and Sir Francis stood. “It is concerning the creation of this moveable rock,” replied Edward. “Sir Francis thinks that nature, in one of her wanton freaks, left it here by chance, either just as we see it, or more than half prepared to be made what we see it, by the chissel and mallet of some ingenious mechanic.” “So he thinks that giants had no hand in the affair,” said Martin, who had followed Miss Agnew's footsteps. “None in the least,” replied Edward. “Nay, he scarcely believes that in the days of the Druids, our fathers were much larger or stronger than ourselves.” “That is consolatory to our modern dignity,” observed Martin; “for what a degenerate race we must be, if our fathers could have set a rock of fifty tons weight, on a place, and in a position, where we could scarcely fix one of five hundred pounds!” “It is time,” said Sir Francis, “that we should prosecute our voyage, if we mean to visit the Gabbons, and return home by day light.” The party accordingly once more betook themselves to their bark, and scudded gently forward, before a pleasant breeze. They withdrew some distance from the land, in order to double a small island called “Muck,” the strait between which and the peninsula being too narrow to admit of an easy passage. When they had cleared this islet, the whole party being in high spirits, felt disposed to enjoy the luxury of music on the water. Edward and Martin had provided for such an enjoyment, by bringing flutes with them. After playing a few tunes in concert, they requested of the ladies a song. Ellen, after stipulating that Miss Agnew should yield them a similar gratification on their return homewards, complied, and sang the following verses, the production of M`Nelvin, to the tune of Coolin, her favourite air, which the gentlemen had been just playing. Oh the best spot on earth for delight to be found, Is at home, where with joy our affection is crowned; Where the wife of our bosom still meets us with smiles, And the mirth of our children each sorrow beguiles. In the walks of ambition, with power and with fame, We may shine in full pomp, and establish a name; But the flower of content, in the soul will not bloom, Unless it first springs from our comforts at home. When disease overtakes us, and wealth flies away, When foes triumph o'er us, and flatterers betray; Ah! where shall we find the true cordial of life, But at home, in th' endearments of children and wife! Whenever my sum of contentment is low, When a bankrupt in bliss, and embarrassed with wo, At home I still find, in the charms that are there, A fund that o'erpays, and discharges my care. The domestic contentment and tranquillity expressed in verses so finely sung, contrasted with the political exasperation and disasters of the times, made a deep impression on all present, which had not altogether subsided when they approached the tremendous Gabbons, the very name of which, to this day, makes the Roman Catholics of the North of Ireland shudder. O'Halloran related the story of the dreadful retaliation which, during the rebellion of 1641, the Presbyterians of the neighbourhood inflicted on the Catholics for a barbarous massacre which the latter had committed on the Protestants inhabiting the borders of the Black water, in the county of Armagh. “The English garrisons had been drawn from that quarter,” said he, “to assist the parliamentary army in making head against the famous Roger Moore, who had raised the standard of rebellion in aid of Tyrconnel, and a great many of the zealous Protestant inhabitants accompanied the troops as volunteers. This afforded an opportunity to the discontented Catholics, of avenging what they considered the cause of their country and their religion, on a proud progeny of foreigners and heretics. On an appointed night, they accordingly arose in arms, and seizing the Protestants of all sexes, ages, and ranks, murdered them, and threw their corpses into the Blackwater. Intelligence of this transaction soon reached the garrisons of Belfast and Carrickfergus, among whom Vol. II. o 2 were many of the Blackwater volunteers, whose families had suffered. Inflamed with grief and rage, and giving way to feelings of barbarity unworthy of the milder spirit and more philosophical doctrines of their religion, they resolved to inflict a terrible example of retribution on their enemies. Assisted by a large party of the Protestant inhabitants, the garrisons sallied out, and seizing about fifteen hundred Catholics of both sexes, bound them together in pairs, and drove them to the edge of that very precipice, (said he, pointing to a long continued perpendicular range of limestone cliffs soaring upwards of two thousand feet above the surface of the sea, and sinking beneath it perhaps as many,) and from the top of that awful cliff, the very sight of which turns one dizzy, those unfortunate beings were whirled into the air, whence they plunged into the watery gulph below, (for there is here no beach) where they sunk to eternity. The place is called, to this day, the “Catholic Leap;” and it is currently believed by thousands of that persuasion, that the blood of those who were bayoneted previous to their being thrown over, which streamed down the white front of the precipice, still does, and shall to the end of the world, remain there as a testimony against the heretics. In this last part of their statement, however,” he continued, “they are mistaken, for no traces of blood are to be seen along the whole course of this tremendous coast. There are, indeed, at the top of the cliffs some veins of a reddish ochry substance, which, in wet weather, is apt to be washed down the precipice, and, at a distance, may be mistaken for blood, and has, no doubt, given origin to this absurd story. The Catholics, indeed, seldom give themselves an opportunity of being undeceived on this subject, for they abhor the place too much to visit it; and, it is said, that none of their body have ever ventured since the occurrence of this unjustifiable transaction, to reside on the peninsula, for, although it is really very fertile, and its present inhabitants prosperous and wealthy, they look on it as an accursed place.” Having contemplated this sublime shore, with an intensity of interest, and solemnity of feeling, which at length became painful, at the request of the ladies, they turned their prow homewards. Every one was so much absorbed in the reflections naturally produced by the foregoing recital, and the awfulness of the scene before them, that, for sometime, they all kept silent. No sounds, but those occasioned by the flapping of the sails, or the rushing of the boat through the water, were heard to interrupt the perpetual clamour of the multitude of gulls, curlews, herons, and innumerable other species of sea fowl, that flew to and from the cliffs where they had erected their airy nests, until the party had cleared the Gabbons, and came opposite to the place where the green land shelves towards the shore. Miss Agnew was then the first to break silence. Addressing Ellen softly, she said, “Ah! there is the green earth again! I begin to breathe easier.” “Oh! how pleasant,” returned Ellen “are the haunts of man, full of care, and sorrow, and pain, and strife, as they generally are, to those who have just emerged from such a scene of wildness, terror and awful sublimity, as that we have just left behind!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XIX. He prospered in his crimes—but what of that— 'Twas but awhile—for soon a dreadful end Arrived, and conscience—scorpion conscience, stung Him to the very marrow, and the frown Of overwhelming and eternal justice, Darkened his dying moments with despair. Irish Soothsayer. On reaching Isle Muck, it was determined to land there, to take some refreshment, and give the ladies an opportunity of recovering their spirits. The surface of this islet consists of a green sward of about three acres in extent. It is uninhabited by man; but commonly contains a flock of sheep, and constantly a multitude of rabbits. It has a fine spring of fresh water near its centre, in consequence of which it is a favourite place of resort for boating parties of pleasure, from the neighbouring country. Our party, after partaking of a cold dinner, materials for which they had taken care to bring with them, spent sometime in rambling over the islet, and viewing from different points, the magnificent and picturesque scenery of land, and water, and rocks, and ships, and castles, and cottages, that at various distances surrounded them. They at length seated themselves on a hillock, to enjoy the sweets of song and music before they departed. Miss Agnew was now called on for the performance of her stipulation with Ellen. She complied, and Edward accompanied her voice with the melody of his flute, while she sung, with much sweetness, the following words, to the tune of Burns's “Bonnie Doon.” Ye natal hills! that softly throw Around my soul, a mystic charm, Oft have ye seen the former joys, That did my youthful bosom warm; When blest with Ellen's lovely smiles, I stray'd your verdant scenes among, As blithe a youth as ever raised, On Irish plains, the rural song. Ye elms that crown yon river's brink, Ye little warblers of their boughs, Why look so fair, why sing so gay, Ye witnessed Ellen's broken vows! Ye saw her lovely blushes spread, As round her breast I would entwine; But now a happier swain enjoys Those dear delights that once were mine. Ye blossomed boughs, and flow'rets sweet, Ye breathe so fresh, and bloom so fair, Ye mind me of my Ellen's charms, When first she did my heart ensnare; Ye mind me of the fickle maid, Whose loss I ever must deplore; For, ah! those dear departed joys, I'll never, never prove them more! The singing was finished, and the company preparing to depart, when two men on horseback were perceived galloping with great speed along the beach of the peninsula, opposite the islet. In a few seconds, a body of ten or twelve countrymen, in pursuit of them, also appeared, who on seeing our party drew back; but not until they had fired some shots at the fugitives, one of which brought the foremost horseman to the ground. Our party had brought some fowling pieces with them. O'Halloran, Sir Francis, Edward and Martin, each seized one, and ran immediately to the boat. In a few minutes they were on the opposite shore, and had rescued the wounded man and his companion from their assailants. But what was their astonishment to find the fallen fugitive, no other than the notorious Sir Geoffrey Carebrow? Compassion predominated over resentment in their bosoms; and without hesitation, they resolved to yield all the relief in their power to the man they had so much reason to detest. They instantly placed him in their boat, and, at the earnest entreaty of his attendant, the infamous Berwick, who represented that he had no other mode of escaping from his pursuers, they received him also on board. They had scarcely regained the Isle Muck shore, when they perceived a man, waving a white handkerchief, running down the declivity which led to the beach, towards them. He soon reached the bottom, from whence he suddenly ascended a high rock connected with a headland which overlooked the islet, from which it jutted, forming a kind of terrace, hanging over the narrow strait that separated the two shores. Approaching the edge of this, he stood still and beckoned to our party, who advanced towards him. He appeared to be a very large active man. His head was wrapped in a red handkerchief, wound round the forehead, extending down the cheeks, and covering the chin, so as effectually to conceal his features. He wore a short roundabout of brown cloth, with buckskin breeches, and had a leathern belt round his waist, from which was suspended something like a sword or huge dagger. When near enough to be distinctly heard, he called out, with a loud voice— “Be joyous!—be joyous! Do not interrupt your pleasure. The blood, the tortures, the groans of your countrymen pass for nothing. Be joyous— Follow your revels. Let the pleasant melody of your flutes delight you; and let your pretty ladies sing to you to wantonness. Why should you be sad! The desolation, the ravaging, the destructions, the burnings, the bayonetings, the shootings, the hangings, the gibbetings, cannot reach you. They are destined for us, an unpitied, execrated, persecuted, proclaimed, outlawed, miserable race; whose homes are ruined, whose families are scattered, and whose heads are sold for a price. But I am not come to reproach you. Among you, we have friends, in whose safety we rejoice. But why prevent us from taking a sweet revenge on our enemies? They are also your enemies, and have sworn lies to bring some of you to destruction; and even now, when you return them good for evil, gall is boiling in their hearts against you, and they would rejoice if that isle would turn a volcano, and swallow you in its flames, if they themselves could escape. They have hunted us here in our hiding places, from hatred and from avarice; for they would earn the price set upon us, while their hearts would riot as in luxury, at the spectacle of our destruction. But although they were strong, and we were weak; although they had a band of soldiers in their train, we had prevailed over them, and had you not interfered, their carcases would have soon bleached on the cliffs of the Gabbons, a feast for the eagle and the seafowl. When we first saw you there to-day, we took you for enemies looking for our concealments, and were about sinking you, by sending a volley of balls through your boat. But God prevented a deed for which we would have sorely lamented. We described your ladies, and concluded that your errand was pleasure, and not treachery. We now know you, and ask you to give up our enemies and yours. If you will not, however, be joyous, we will not molest you. But how can you feel joy in shielding the murderer of Nelson from justice?” He paused as if he had asked a triumphant question, and waited for an answer. O'Halloran waved his hand, and endeavoured to address him in his own wild style. “Hear me,” cried he, “and hear the voice of a friend. Our enemy is now helpless, and in our hands. We know his wickedness; we have felt his villany, but his punishment does not belong to us. We form no tribunal in the country. We cannot, therefore, chastise the guilty. This man is wounded; I fear, for your sakes I fear, mortally wounded. We will try to save him that we may do the duty which man owes to man; and also that you may be free from his blood. If he dies, I trust God will forgive you. To God alone, vengeance for such crimes as his, belongs.” “Depart then,” cried the man on the rock, “since you will have it so. This dagger, which I hoped to have plunged into the heart of the destroyer of Nelson, since it cannot perform that office, shall never perform another; and I shall never have peace on earth, since I cannot have vengeance.” So saying, he ran to an angle of the rock, which overhung the sea, and with a mighty force cast the dagger from him. With the rapidity of a thunderbolt, it whizzed through the air, and sunk to the bottom. “So sink to fathomless perdition the betrayers of their country!” exclaimed the man, and he darted from his airy stand with the headlong speed of a falcon, towards his companions. On his disappearance, O'Halloran informed the astonished party, that he believed him to be M`Cauley, one of M`Bride's assassins, and one of the proclaimed rebels, who had no mercy to expect. Poor fellow;” said he, with a sigh! “his whole soul is devoted to an unfortunate cause; but a cause which he conscientiously believes to be just. But how did he allure Sir Geoffrey into this ambuscade?” said he, turning to Berwick, for Sir Geoffrey himself was unfit for conversation. “Here is a letter,” replied Berwick, “which will explain that matter.” O'Halloran at once declared the hand writing to be M`Cauley's. He read it aloud as follows: “Sir Geoffrey Carebrow is informed by the writer of this, who wishes to share with him the reward offered for the heads of M`Cauley, Darragh, Archer, Kelly, and some others of the proscribed rebels, that if he will meet him at the uninhabited house near Isle Muck, to-morrow afternoon, the writer will go with him, and point out a cave amidst the cliffs of the Gabbons, where they are secreted. This cave is accessible only by a very intricate path, which will be discovered to Sir Geoffrey. He may bring his servant Berwick with him; but must bring no military, lest alarm should be excited. The writer not wishing to be known, if military be brought, or any other servant than Berwick, whom he thinks trustworthy, he will not appear.” “Notwithstanding this caution,” said Berwick, “my master brought fifty soldiers with him; but left them about half a mile from the place of meeting, and ordered me to accompany him there. The place is just behind that hill. On our way, after leaving the soldiers, I hinted to my master, that there might be treachery in the affair. This seemed to alarm him, but he persisted in going forward, saying that the rebels were now too much frightened to do any more mischief. Being well mounted, we soon arrived in sight of the “Old Ruins,” where we were to meet our unknown confederate, when perceiving the muzzles of two guns projecting out of one of the broken windows, my master's fear overcame his resolution, and we turned round to fly; but our flight towards the military was intercepted by a number of armed men, who were advancing on us. We had, therefore, nothing for it, but to take the road to the beach, which we did in such terror, that we scarcely knew whither we fled, and should Vol. II. p undoubtedly have fallen into their hands had not your appearance checked their approach.” As Sir Geoffrey seemed to be in great torture, our party hastened homeward with all the sail their boat could carry, in order as soon as possible to procure for him more comfortable accommodations and surgical assistance; for they did not conceive it safe or humane to reland him on the peninsula, now the resort of his infuriated and determined enemies. It soon became so calm that their sails were not of much service. They were therefore, furled; and the servants set to the oars. Sir Geoffrey becoming very faint, they gave him some wine, and laid him on the bottom of the boat, in as comfortable a position as their circumstances would permit. His groans and ejaculations, indicating great torment of both mind and body, made a strong and melancholy impression on all present, especially the ladies. Cheerfulness, joy and mirth, vanished, and anxiety, gloom, and compassion occupied their places. In the mind of Ellen, as she saw her dreaded persecutor, the arch enemy of her peace, and the perjured betrayer of her grandfather's life, lying before her in all the agonies of mental despair and bodily pain, a suppliant for the compassion of those who had suffered so much from his wickedness, a mingled sensation of horror and pity arose, accompanied with an awful impression of the power of Providence, in frustrating the machinations of the wicked, and inflicting a just retribution for their crimes. Her feelings on this subject, became so intense, that she almost fainted, as she leaned on the breast of her father; but tears, the holy tears of heart-felt compassion, came to her relief. “Why do you weep, my child?” asked her father. “Ah! father,” she replied, in a low tone, “I have been overcome by reflecting on that signal example now before us, of the certainty of vice meeting with punishment. That man's great wealth and influence seemed to place his crimes beyond the reach of human power to punish; but a mightier power, one that can be neither eluded nor withstood, has taken up the sword of justice. Oh! that it may be exercised in mercy, and not in proportion to his guilt! I cannot but feel for his severe anguish. He is one of God's creatures; and if his crimes have been great, his sufferings also are great.” “Be comforted, my daughter,” said Sir Francis, in a soothing manner. “This sight must indeed be appalling to you. But remember that if God punishes severely here, it is for gracious purposes hereafter.” Edward who during this conversation, sat beside her, did not utter a word. He was alarmed for the effect of such a spectacle on her mind, and became quite impatient for their reaching home. He threw off his coat, and flew to one of the oars, which was wrought by a man who seemed rather fatigued; and putting to it his whole strength, gave such an increased impulse to the boat's motion on his side, that two men had to work the corresponding oar on the other, and the boat moved through the water with almost double velocity. The promontory of Ballygally soon drew near, and the bay in which O'Halloran Castle is situated, opened before them, and, in a short time the boat rested along side of a small pier, where she was usually kept. Sir Geoffrey was immediately conveyed to that Castle, which he had been so lately active in damaging, and the generous hospitality of which, he was now thankful to accept. Messages, at the same time, were despatched to request the attendance of Doctor Ferral, and Mr. M`Claverty. It was thought desirable that the latter should be made acquainted with the circumstances of the case, lest the government, or Sir Geoffrey's friends, might imbibe any misapprehension on the subject. The doctor attended immediately; and on examining the wound, unequivocally declared that it would be mortal. When informed of his situation, he became greatly dismayed, and overcome with the dread of death. When the first shock of his terror somewhat subsided, the propriety of sending for a notary and a clergyman was suggested to him. He at first opposed this, but musing for a few minutes, during an interval of ease which medicine now procured for him, he ejaculated, “Yes, it must be so! My days are finished.—Send for the Rev. Mr. Nichols, and for any notary you think proper; but let them come soon. In the meantime, request Miss O'Halloran to speak with me. A dying man cannot harm her; I wish her grandfather also to be present.” With trembling steps, Ellen approached his bedside, supported by O'Halloran. “This is kind in you,” said Sir Geoffrey. “I have asked you here to request forgiveness from you both, for the injuries I intended you. After which I shall, with an easier mind, solicit the forgiveness of Heaven.” They both assured him, that they forgave him with all their hearts. “Dost thou, fair lady,” said he; “thou whom I loved more intensely than ever I did any of thy sex; thou whom I so severely, so cruelly treated; dost thou really say so? or is it only a fond illusion of my mind?” “I do really say so,” replied Ellen. “I do indeed sincerely forgive you, and may Heaven forgive you also!” “And you pray for me too,” said he. “Oh! then, I may indeed hope; for Heaven will surely hear the petition of innocence and virtue like thine.” Then turning to O'Halloran, he said “much injured man, dare I hope that you also will pray for your enemy?” “Yes,” replied O'Halloran. “Unfortunate man, fervently do I pray, that the Almighty will grant you repentance, and pardon for all your crimes; and he is able to pardon them, be they ever so aggravated and numerous.” “And art thou he,” exclaimed the conscience-struck criminal, “to effect whose destruction, I did not, in the height of my vengeful feelings, scruple to sin against my soul? Ah! that lies heavy on me!” “For that too,” said O'Halloran, “I hope you will be forgiven.” “God bless you,” cried the penitent, “and hear your prayers in my behalf. And oh! may you never feel the pangs of conscience, which I now feel.—Oh! the sting—the fiery sting of conscience, that burns within me.—Oh! pity me—pray for me!—but you have promised it, and you are not liars; you are not perjured criminals like me! O! my vile passions, revenge!—lust!—avarice!— to what have you brought me? You have brought on me—wretched me—a load of guilt, greater than I can bear.—Oh! that murdered innocence!—that too was passion. Ellen, thou knowest of it.—Didst thou not once speak of it? But hush—no—thou needst not hush; for God knows of it.—Ah! I could not hide it from him; and he is now my judge! Oh! pray for me, pray for me, that he will have mercy!—but I had not mercy. She pleaded on her knees for mercy; but I would not hear her.— Oh! there can be no mercy for me! O God of justice thou art terrible!” Vol. II. p 2 He here convulsively covered his head, as if to conceal from his view something too dreadful to behold. Ellen could endure the scene no longer; for she had never conceived of any thing so appalling as the horrible contortions of despair that disfigured Sir Geoffrey's countenance, and the wild flashing terror that gleamed from his eyes. She was therefore, obliged to withdraw from such a distressing spectacle of human misery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XX. Beside the bed where parting life is laid; And sorrow, guilt and pain by turns dismayed; The reverend champion stood. At his controul Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul. Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise, And his last faultering accents whispered praise. Goldsmith. Prompt to the calls of duty, the Rev. Mr. Nichols soon arrived; and never had a sinner more need of the consolations of the most merciful of all religions, than the despairing object to whom they now administered. “No matter how great your crimes may be,” said the holy man, when he found Sir Geoffrey had become sufficiently calm to listen to him, “an infinite propitiation—an omnipotent atonement has been made for human guilt. Put your trust in the great Redeemer, who died to ransom such as you, from the effects of their transgressions, when they feel a genuine contrition; and, acknowledging their offences, throw themselves on his mercy for pardon. Your penitence may be late; yet, it will be accepted, if it be sincere. He who could pardon the malefactor on the cross, is the same to-day, in power and in purpose, that he was then. Do not think that he died and suffered in vain, or that there can be any crime too great to be propitiated by such a sacrifice. No, the sufferings and death of the Son of God were a sufficient ransom for all the crimes committed by ten thousand worlds, although each of them were ten thousand times more heinous than the most heinous of yours. He who pardoned the guilt of the royal adulterer and murderer, he who cleansed away the abominations of Menasseh, and forgave the cruelty of the persecuting Saul, can blot out your iniquities; and no one who sincerely sought for his redemption ever sought in vain: for he is long-suffering, and full of kindness towards his creatures, and he has expressly said that, in the event of their repentance, although their sins be as scarlet, he will make them white as wool.” After this encouraging exhortation, followed by a fervent and animated address to the throne of Divine Mercy, the patient's mind became considerably composed, and, on the arrival of the notary, he was in a capacity to go through the task of arranging his temporal affairs. This being accomplished, he desired to see O'Halloran; and taking from his pocket a key, he presented it to him, together with a newly written paper. “This key,” said he, “opens a small set of ebony drawers, which you will find seated on a shelf in the south-eastern angle of my library, and this paper is a deed of gift of these drawers, and all that they contain, with the exceptions I shall immediately mention. This deed I now make over to you in the presence of this notary. In the drawers, there are testimonies of crimes I have committed, of which, I hope, through the merits and sufferings of my Redeemer, to obtain eternal forgiveness; but the promulgation of which, while it would do the world no good, would uselessly bring ruin on the reputation, and embitter the lives of several individuals, who may have yet long to live. The exceptions to which I have alluded, are three certificates of money I possess in the national funds, which are to be disposed of as mentioned in my will. Every thing else contained in these drawers of value, or not of value, is bequeathed to you.” O'Halloran assured him that he would cheerfully take charge of these things; and endeavour to fulfil his intentions, as far as lay in his power, concerning them, and concerning all other matters that might be entrusted to his care. The patient was then left quiet, and the anguish of both his mind and body being greatly relieved, he fell into a slumber, which, although an uneasy one, continued till near the morning. When M`Claverty arrived, he was awake and considerably distressed from a recurrence of his bodily pain. “In the name of heaven?” exclaimed M`Claverty, on entering and seeing the ghastly countenance of Sir Geoffrey, “how has this happened?” “My evil career has been cut short,” replied Sir Geoffrey. “I was shot at yesterday by a parcel of men, I believe some of the outlawed rebels, whose place of concealment I was endeavouring to discover. A ball has entered beneath my ribs, and I feel that my existence here will soon terminate.” “Shall I write this down?” asked the magistrate, “as your declaration of the means by which you came by the accident.” “You may, and I will sign it,” was the reply. This being done, he again fell into a slumber, which his pain did not permit to continue long; and he awoke with the hand of death upon him. He requested to see Ellen. When she entered his bedchamber, “Bless me, fair saint,” said he, “and I shall die contented.” “May the God of Heaven bless you,” she replied, while the tears filled her eyes, “and take you to himself.” “Amen!” he tried to utter, but the word died on his lips; and he sank back on the pillow, in the agony of death. Ellen gave a scream of terror, and was led from the appalling sight, almost senseless with horror. In a few minutes Sir Geoffrey was no more. On investigating the circumstances of the case, the coroner's inquest gave a verdict of “killed by a gunshot wound, received from some person unknown, but supposed to be one of the rebels now in a state of proscription.” After the funeral, the notary signified to Messrs. O'Halloran, M`Claverty, and Wilson, that they were appointed by the deceased, executors of his last testament, and requested their attendance the next day, at Carebrow Hall, in order that the manner in which he had disposed of his property might be made known to all whom it concerned. They accordingly met, and the will was read in the presence of all the testators and relatives who could conveniently attend, of whom a married sister, and two female cousins, both married, were the nearest of kin.” “His whole property, both real and personal, was bequeathed to his sister, with the exceptions mentioned in the will, of which the principal was his government stock, amounting to £150,000, for which he held three different debentures. The first marked No. 1, for seventy thousand pounds, he bequeathed to Ellen, as an atonement for the persecutions his uncontrollable passion had obliged her to sustain. The others were to be equally divided between his two cousins. The ebony drawers with all they contained, excepting these debentures, being bequeathed to O'Halloran, he proceeded according to the express direction of the will to examine them in private. In the first drawer, he opened, he found the debentures. In the second, he found the mortgage which he had given for sixty thousand pounds on his own estate. He immediately relocked the drawers, and returning to the company, desired so much of the will to be a second time read, as would enable him clearly to understand the testator's meaning, in bequeathing to him the ebony drawers, and their contents. This being done, “Gentlemen,” said he to the other executors, “I am so delicately situated, with respect to this legacy that my judgment cannot, at once, decide how to act. I shall, however, be governed by your opinions. I borrowed, as is now publicly known, a large sum from the deceased, and gave him, for security, a mortgage on my landed property, which mortgage, to my astonishment, I find in one of these drawers.” “Then it is undoubtedly your's,” observed M`Claverty. “This explains the mystery of his anxiety to give you the key of these drawers, before he died, and, perhaps too, of his requisition that you should examine them privately, lest some interested person might displace that important paper.” “I am not clear on that point,” returned O'Halloran. “This instrument might have been there without it recurring to his memory, when he dictated the will. For you are aware of the dreadful state of mind he was in at that time.” “But,” replied M`Claverty “if he could recollect where he kept the government securities, he might, it is to be presumed, easily recollect where he kept your mortgage.” “Gentlemen,” interrupted the notary, “with your permission, I can, at once, decide this controversy. When writing that part of the will, the deceased declared to me that his intention was to give up to Mr. O'Halloran the incumbrance that he held on his property. He added, that he took this method of doing so, as he felt a repugnance to mention this mortgage in a will which might become public, and, at all events, would go down to the posterity of his relatives; for in several transactions connected with it, he had not acted in a manner satisfactory to his conscience.” “Since that is the case,” said O'Halloran, “I believe I need not scruple to avail myself of this unexpected kindness of the deceased, who had an undoubted right to dispose of this part of his property as he pleased.” “Upon my soul,” exclaimed M`Claverty, “you seem as much afraid of touching what is decidedly your own, as if you were committing theft. But I wish you joy of your good fortune, and on account of this business, I shall, notwithstanding all his faults, respect the testator's memory as long as I live.” The government debentures being now produced, each of the female cousins received that appropriated to her; and at the desire of his co-executors, O'Halloran placed that bequeathed to Ellen in his pocket-book, and in company with Mr. Wilson, returned home on horseback, ordering his servants to follow with the ebony bureau in the carriage. That evening after tea, Mrs. Brown had left the room on some domestic business, and Martin had accompanied Miss Agnew on a ramble into the fields. Edward and Ellen, were therefore left to the unobserved and delicious enjoyment of their own society. They had been for sometime conversing on late events, and were now indulging their imagination, in sketching scenes of future felicity, of which they were to be long in the enjoyment; or, in other words, they were building delightful “Castles in the air,” when O'Halloran entered. The “baseless fabrics” immediately “dissolved;” and the lovers on again descending to the earth, found themselves in the midst of a castle of more durable materials; one whose rocky foundations and strongly cemented massive walls of stone and lime, had already withstood the pressure of several centuries, and were likely to withstand that of several more. When O'Halloran approached, “My love!” said he to Ellen, “since God has, I hope, removed to himself, the man who lately so much disturbed your peace, I trust that any resentment you may ever have felt against him, is buried in his grave; and that you harbour no wish injurious to his memory.” She looked steadfastly in his face, and repeated, “harbour, a wish injurious to his memory? No, my grandfather, my worst wish concerning him is that his soul may now be in Paradise.” “For that sentiment, dear, forgiving girl, then,” said he, “receive this;” and he handed her the paper by which she became a government creditor, to the amount of seventy thousand pounds. “This shows, at least, that he wished to make some atonement for what he caused you to suffer. He has bequeathed you this.” “She looked at the paper for several seconds, as if involved in some doubt concerning it. “And am I free to receive this legacy?” she asked. “As perfectly free,” he replied, “as if I had myself willed it to you, on my death-bed.” Edward here started as if from a reverie. “Miss Hamilton,” said he, “if your grandfather has no objection, I wish just now to speak with you a moment on this subject by ourselves.” “With all my heart,” said O'Halloran; “but remember that it is not in the power of Sir Geoffrey's executors to make any other disposal of this property. So fastidiousness may only occasion unnecessary perplexity.” “I shall counsel her to accept it,” replied Edward; and O'Halloran immediately withdrew. Vol. II. Q “As I trust,” said the young lover, to the mistress of his heart, when they were alone—“As I trust that your fortune and mine, will soon be the same, for a letter containing my father's consent to my happiness, I expect daily, I hope that it will not be considered officiousness in me to suggest my wishes respecting your disposal of this legacy; for I perceive that you must receive it, although you are not obliged to keep it. My fortune does not require any addition. My present income, independent of my friends, is ample, even for the support of splendour; and the entailed estates of my father and my uncle, for the latter it is not likely will ever marry, will, in the course of time, descend to us or ours. But your grandfather is involved in a large debt to the estate of this very Sir Geoffrey, who has made you so considerable a legatee, and it would almost appear that he had done so to enable you to relieve from this incumbrance, a man whom he had so seriously injured.” “It is right! Edward,” she replied. “How kind you are to advise me thus? My grandfather's debts shall be discharged immediately out of this sum. Let us hasten to him, for I shall not be easy until it be done.” O'Halloran had gone to his library. They followed him, Ellen still holding the paper in her hand.” “What,” said he, as he saw them approaching, “have you decided already? I see you are a persuasive adviser, Mr. Barrymore.” “Grandfather!” said Ellen, running to him, and catching him by the hand, “you must grant me one request.” “Be assured, my dear,” he returned, “that I shall grant you any thing in reason.” “In reason, or out of reason,” she observed, “you must grant me this one.” “That is very provoking, Ellen, you did not use to be so unconscionable. But what would you have? my child.” “I would have you to receive this,” said she, presenting him the government note. “If it be to manage it for you, I shall receive it with pleasure?” he replied. “No,” said she, “manage it for yourself, my grandfather. I do not wish Sir Geoffrey's successors to have any claim upon you.” “They have no claim upon me,” he replied. “But, if they had, do you think I would rob you to satisfy them? No, I would rather sell my last acre.” “Are you not largely indebted to Sir Geoffrey's heirs?” she asked. “I do not owe them a fraction, my child,” he answered. “But I cannot, indeed, I cannot bear this!” Here tears of fondness and joy swelled in his eyes. “Your affection makes your old grandfather weep like a babe. Come to my arms, and let me embrace the daughter, the delight of my old age.” So saying he impressed a parental kiss on her glowing cheek, and sat down for a few seconds, to recover from his agitation. Then again rising, “Edward!—Ellen!” said he, catching a hand of each, and joining them; “may your children, and your children's children, love you with a love like this, and make your hoary age as happy as you now make mine!” “Thank you, father, for this inestimable gift,” cried Edward; and forgetting himself in the delirium of the moment, “Permit me too to embrace such excellence,” said he to Ellen, and he also impressed a burning kiss on her cheek ere she was aware. In an instant, she burst from his embrace, and ran to conceal her confusion in an anti-chamber. Edward immediately perceived that he had acted rudely, and had given offence, and heartily condemning himself, he begged O'Halloran to intercede for his pardon. “I am mad!” cried he; I have insulted an angel. I know not what I am doing.” “Young man!” said O'Halloran, “I confess you are rather vehement. But, be at ease, I shall try to procure your forgiveness.” He then sought Ellen, and leading her back into Edward's presence—“You must forgive this rash youth,” said he, “for I set him the example; and he only forgot that he had not the weight of nearly threescore years on his head, to entitle him to such privileges.” “Pardon me, Miss Hamilton!” said Edward, imploringly. “By Heavens! you know I would rather cut off my right hand than offer you an intentional insult.” “Well, sir,” said she, “to please my grandfather, I will overlook this piece of folly. But you must remember never to treat me again with such disrespect!” “Never, never, my beloved!” he exclaimed, as he fervently kissed the hand she held out to him in token of reconciliation. “Well!” said O'Halloran, seating himself on a chair, and laughing heartily at them—“What fools you are! what a love-scene you have acted in the presence of an old man! It will be well for you if I do not discover the whole to Miss Agnew. She would, undoubtedly, divert young Martin with it for a month to come.” They both begged that he would not mention the incident, it was so ridiculous, and was now no more to be thought of by themselves. He cautioned them to keep their own secret, and he should certainly not betray them. “But!” said Ellen, wishing to turn the conversation into another channel, “You refuse my offer; may I ask the reason?” “Because, my child,” said O'Halloran, “I do not need it.” I have a clear income of five thousand a year, which is more than enough for an old widower of fifty-nine, who has no longer any ambition to become conspicuous in the world.” “How is this! grandfather,” said she, “pardon my enquiry, for you know your welfare is necessary to mine.” “I know it, my daughter, and shall satisfy you.” He then produced the mortgage, and informed them that he also was a legatee of Sir Geoffrey, at least to the amount mentioned in that instrument, but to how much more he did not himself know, as he had not yet examined all the ebony drawers. “Then, sir,” said she, “I suppose I must keep my legacy.” “I suppose so,” he replied; “and I shall just mention one thing to you, my daughter, not for the purpose of stifling the feelings of generosity in your bosom, which I hope will ever remain active there, but to remind you that property honestly obtained, should not be thrown away;—you may have children, and grandchildren.” Edward and she instinctively exchanged looks full of meaning and emotion, and in much confusion she hastily left their presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. q 2 CHAP. XXI. My safety thy fair truth shall be, As sword and buckler serving; My life shall be more dear to me, Because of thy preserving; Let peril come, let horror threat, Let thundering cannons rattle; I fearless seek the conflict's heat, Assured when on the wings of love, To Heaven above, Thy fervent orisons are flown, The tender prayer Thou putt'st up there, Shall call a guardian angel down, To watch me in the battle. Popular Song. That very evening one of O'Halloran's servants brought from the post-office, a letter to Edward from his father, and one to Sir Francis Hamilton from the Lord Lieutenant. Edward's was as follows: “My Son—A few days ago, I received from you a very foolish letter, requesting me to consent to your marriage with a woman I never saw, nor, until that very moment, ever heard of. I took, of course, some pains to inquire concerning her, and her connexions. The only person from whom I could obtain much information, is your old mendicant protagee, who praises her in a style that I cannot well understand; but from which I can gather that she is a great beauty. I presume, therefore, that in the ardour of your admiration, you have endowed her with angelic qualities, for in the eyes of every love-sick young man who has a handsome mistress, she cannot be aught else than an angel. “But, sir, how does it happen that you could suppose your father as easily blinded as yourself on such a subject? or how could you imagine that bright eyes and a fine complexion, could make up in my estimation for obscurity of birth, and rebellious connexions;—for I understand that the lady in question, is daughter to an outlaw, and granddaughter to a rebel; and a rebel too of the very worst stamp; one whose influence in the country has been wilfully perverted from preserving its tranquillity to promoting its destruction. How could the loyal, the virtuous, the patriotic Edward Barrymore, he of whose promising talents and acquirements, his friends have been hitherto so proud, degrade himself, and the family whose representative he is, by such a connexion? “I speak nothing of the lady's want of fortune, although I am informed that her grandfather, on whom she totally depends, has mortgaged his property for more than it is worth, for the wicked purpose too of procuring supplies for the rebel armies. If ever the fomenter of a country's ruin deserved death, this jacobinical old man, according to all accounts, did so. But your boyish and imprudent attachment for a handsome face, interfered and snatched him from justice. When I first heard of that affair, I was silly enough to approve of your conduct, as I ascribed it to a generous impulse of humanity and gratitude for one who had, as it is reported, saved your life. But I now see that a foolish passion for a pretty girl, was at the bottom of your apparent benevolence. What your uncle will say on this subject, I cannot tell, for I have not yet communicated it to him. But as he scarcely approved of your interference in behalf of the old rebel, I presume he will utterly disapprove of your intention to contaminate the purity of your family blood, by marrying the granddaughter.—But enough on this subject. “Ah! sir, is it a time for any of the house of Barrymore to bask indolently in the rays of beauty, or in the enjoyment of female blandishments, when the fabric of society is tottering to its very foundations? When your country is assailed at once by domestic traitors and foreign invaders, ought you, in the vigour of youth and activity, to desert her cause, and lie supinely sunk under the fascinations of love and luxury? “I call on you, I order you, to throw off your disgraceful chains and fly to the standard of your king and country. The French have landed, in what force it is not exactly known, on the Connaught coast. But it is certain that they will form a rallying point for insurrection. It is said that the peasantry have already swelled their ranks to a countless multitude. I take the field to-morrow, as commander of a regiment of cavalry, in which I have preserved for you the rank of a captain. Cornwallis has placed himself at the head of the troops; and I trust that we shall all exhibit a zeal and soldier-like conduct, worthy of our cause, and of such a renowned commander. “I shall expect you to join us, wherever we may be encamped, in a week at farthest from this date; and, if you do your duty on this occasion, as becomes you, your late errors will be forgiven, by your indulgent father, “THOMAS BARRYMORE.” The Lord Lieutenant's letter required Sir Francis Hamilton's immediate attendance on the army. “* * * * * * * * * At what an awful crisis,” said he, “have I been entrusted with the government of this unfortunate country? Treason, rebellion, massacre, and invasion, have shaken her to pieces, and have prostrated her into the depth of misery. “I remember you were ever proud of being an Irishman. Show yourself now worthy of the name, and fly to the standard which is raised for the preservation of whatever your country yet possesses of law, order, civilization, and rational freedom. I want such men as you about me. Your counsels whether as a statesman or a soldier, to me will be valuable; and they will be the more acceptable, as I know that they will be given with uprightness, and with the feelings not only of a wise man, but of an Irishman, anxious for the safety and welfare of his country. “I hope you have, before this time, availed yourself of the exertion of the executive prerogative which I made in your favour. I need not say how happy I felt at being thus able to pay the debt of gratitude under which you laid me on that terrible night at Yorktown, when the furious American colonel, Scammel, made his desperate attack on our defences. On that dreadful night, his brandished weapon hovered over my head, and would have cut short my existence, had you not heroically interposed and clove him to the earth. “I could, with much gratification, dwell longer on those trans-atlantic subjects; but with me time is now precious; and I hasten to request you to lose none in coming to resume your former station in my military household, as my confidential aid-de-camp. “I have with true and undiminished esteem, the honour to be, &amp;c. “CORNWALLIS.” Edward and Sir Francis made hasty preparations to set off, in obedience to these requisitions, the next morning. Edward saw that, with respect to Ellen, his father had received some gross misrepresentations, which caused him, in the mean time, to labour under several grieviously mistaken impressions, but which he knew that, at their first interview, he could, by a simple statement of the truth, easily remove. He did not, therefore, think proper to disclose to either her or her friends, this part of the intelligence he had received; for, besides his reluctance to wound their feelings, he did not wish to occasion a renewal of O'Halloran's interdiction, to address her on the subject of love, which interdiction he had just withdrawn, under the conviction that, from the nature of her present circumstances, her future prospects, and recently discovered parentage, there was but little danger of the Barrymores offering much opposition to the intended union. Ellen was much agitated on parting with her lover. “You are going,” said she, “into danger. I may never see you again. Oh! I thought—I presumptuously thought, that all my misfortunes were at an end—but I may yet have the greatest that could befall me, to endure. And my father too—to be torn from me. Oh! Heaven grant that I may not have just found him only to lose him forever!” “Dearest Ellen,” replied her lover, “be comforted. This new disturbance, this daring invasion will not be long able to withstand the power that shall be led to its suppression under the direction of such an able commander. When we shall have driven our enemies from the country, no impediment, my love, will then exist to the completion of our happiness. I must now assist my country to the best of my abilities; but fear not but that I shall soon return safe and victorious, and shall then claim her fairest daughter as the dear reward of my services.” “Go, then, my Edward; and, if my unceasing prayers can prevail on Heaven to protect thee, thou shalt indeed return safe and uninjured.” “Then, my love,” said he, “heaven, I am assured, will hear thy prayers; and I shall have nothing to fear.” They now exchanged vows of lasting fidelity; and Ellen retired to seek sympathy from the friendship of Miss Agnew. But Miss Agnew was in almost as much need of a comforter as herself. She had just taken a tender farewell of Martin, who had resolved, in this alarming juncture, to volunteer his services to the government. Sir Francis requested Jemmy Hunter to accompany him, as his attendant, to which he readily agreed after a reluctant and weeping consent was obtained from his Peggy, to whom he gave a tender embrace at parting; and with a full and manly heart said, “may God keep you and the wean, frae a' ill till I see you again!” With her child, (which was now about six weeks old) in her arms, she followed him to the door. “You were aye kind to me, Jemmy,” said she, half choaked with grief, “but you are noo gaun in a lawfu' cause, and in guid company. May Grace gae wi' ye!—an' may He keep you that can keep you, an' bring you safe back to your wife an' wean!” She then retired to offer up to heaven, in simple but fervent language, the artless wishes of her soul for the husband of her affections, the father of her child. As Jemmy rode to the castle to join the gentlemen, previous to their departure, he thought intensely of his Peggy. “Gude keep her for a guid creature, and the wee helpless wean—how it looked at me!” Here a few tears swelled in his eyes. “But I maunna be such a chicken as this,” thought he, and he wiped them off with a courageous resolution, that they should have no successors.</field>

The French under the command of general Humbert, an experienced and active officer of revolutionary origin, landed about the middle of August, to the number of between eleven and twelve hundred men, at Killala, in the west of the island. They brought with them a large quantity of arms and warlike stores of every description, for the supply of the multitude of insurgents, whom they expected immediately to join their standard; and, in some degree, they were not disappointed; although the conciliatory measures so prudently adopted by the new administration, prevented their hopes from being altogether realized. Landing in a Catholic district, they were indeed joined by a considerable number of the more zealous of the lower orders of that persuasion; but they were denied the more efficient aid of the influential and wealthy portion of the community, who had universally embraced the terms of the late proclamation of indemnity, and remained at peace. Vol. II. r The French, with their Irish auxiliaries, soon advanced upon Castlebar, the capital of Mayo, the county in which they landed, and there briskly attacked and defeated general Lake, who commanded a small division of the royal troops. This success opened their way into the interior of the country, and, besides increasing the number of their insurgent allies, spread consternation among all ranks of the royalists throughout the kingdom. Cornwallis, however, was soon on his march at the head of ten thousand men, in order to wrest its short lived triumph from the invading standard. He was about three day's march from the metropolis, when Edward Barrymore and his friends joined him. Sir Francis Hamilton received from the Lord Lieutenant all that cordial and friendly welcome, which, from his knowledge of that nobleman's warmth of heart, he expected; and was immediately appointed to the office which he had been solicited to accept. Edward's father was so well pleased with his orders having been so promptly obeyed, that he received his son with much kindness. “This is right, Edward,” said he, taking him aside, “you will now have a more honourable employment than sighing at the feet of a woman.” “Ah! sir,” replied Edward, “you do not know that woman, otherwise you would not speak so lightly of her.” “So you think, foolish boy. I see she has you still in her chains. But I shall not at present reproach you. I indeed admire your obedience and zeal on this occasion the more, that I perceive what they have cost you. But when you choose a wife, if you would please me, you must choose one well connected.” “Oh father, this lady's connexions are not properly known to you.” “I have heard of them.” “But permit me to say that you have heard misrepresentations.” “Was not her grandfather a rebel chief, condemned to the gallows?” “Yes, sir; but deservedly pardoned. He was always virtuous, humane, and honourable.” “Is her father not an outlaw for murder?” “No, sir!” “And what is he?” “His name is Sir Francis Hamilton.” “What! he who came here to-day with you, and whom his excellency esteems so much?” “The same is Ellen Hamilton's father.” “Why, I was told that O'Halloran is her name, and that her grandfather to save her from the disgrace of bearing that of a murderer, gave her his own.” “He gave it to her from affection, as he brought her up from her infancy, her father having had to fly the country.” “It is true then, he was an outlaw?” “Yes, but not for murder. His wife's honour was assailed by a villain. For her he fought, as, in similar circumstances, you would have done, and conquered.” “Well, my son, we shall speak more of this hereafter,” he said, perceiving the Lord Lieutenant and Sir Francis Hamilton advancing towards them. “Mr. Barrymore,” said his excellency, “permit me to become acquainted with your son, of whom my friend, Sir Francis Hamilton, whom I beg leave to introduce to you, speaks so highly.” The introduction having taken place, the party accompanied Lord Cornwallis to his quarters. They had scarcely sat down, when an express arrived with intelligence that the enemy had penetrated as far as Tuam, in the county of Gallway, little more than a day's march distant, where they had chosen ground for an encampment, which they had commenced entrenching, as if they intended there to await an attack. Their number was not ascertained, but, including the French, it was supposed to be nearly twenty thousand. Orders to move forward, were immediately issued. The trumpets sounded, the drums beat to arms, and in a few minutes the army resumed its march. The honourable Thomas Barrymore at the head of a squadron of horse, led the van. His son had a station assigned to him in the same corps, in order that he might be near his father. That night brought them within ten miles of the enemy; and, at about nine o'clock the next morning, they perceived the insurrectionary banners in the vicinity of the tri-coloured flag, floating in the air on the opposite hill, about a mile distant, which was covered with a countless multitude, but who were evidently, with the exception of the French, quite destitute of every thing like military discipline. Humbert had indeed made every arrangement in his power, to repel the formidable attack which he knew he was about to sustain; and something like a regular division of his forces into four bodies appeared to have taken place. His own men were in the centre, where the ground was most accessible. Behind them, and on each side, large bodies of the Irish, covering almost the whole rising ground, were placed. The French artillery was stationed at intervals along the front of their line. Between the two armies there was a low broken hedge, along which, on the side next the royal army, ran a small stream, but which, at this time, owing to a long series of dry weather, contained very little water. However much assured of victory, the military caution of Cornwallis, would not permit him to make the attack until he had ascertained the most practicable spot for passing the obstruction with his cavalry. For this purpose he despatched colonel Barrymore, with a party of about fifty horsemen, up the streamlet, while another trusty officer, with a similar party, went on the same errand in the opposite direction. Edward attended his father on this duty, and Jemmy Hunter who had, on his arrival at the camp, obtained permission to join the cavalry, was also of the party. The detachment which went down the stream soon found such a passage as their general wanted; and immediately returned. As the Barrymore detachment, therefore, gained the brow of a small hill, about half a mile distant from where they had set out, they heard the royal trumpets sounding; and immediately a heavy cannonade was commenced by the king's troops, reciprocated almost instantly by their opponents. Knowing by this, that the object of their search was elsewhere discovered, they were about returning to their former station, when they observed a body of about a hundred and fifty insurgent horsemen descending the hill, leading from the extremity of the enemy's right, and approaching towards them at full speed. They immediately formed into a compact body, and riding briskly among the insurgents, whose very speed had deranged their order, if they had ever possessed any, in a few minutes put them to flight with considerable loss. They had scarcely pursued the fugitives to the bottom of the hill, when two men on horseback were perceived rushing furiously down in order to rally them. One of these men in particular displayed great energy. With a drawn sabre he endeavoured to arrest the Vol. II. R 2 progress of those who seemed resolved to fly past him, exclaiming, “Cowards! see what a handful of men you fly from! Turn, for heaven's sake, and fight. This day decides the fate of your country. Follow me; if ye are men, follow me!” Only about thirty of the most resolute reined their horses and followed him, as foremost and almost alone, he rushed on his opponents. The first and second of Barrymore's horsemen he met scarcely obstructed his flying speed. He gave each only a passing blow with his sabre, by which he clove them from their horses, as if he had struck twigs from their stems. Opposition seemed to give way before him; and, almost unobstructed, he directed his fearful course towards colonel Barrymore. Edward, alarmed for his father's safety, galloped forward to arrest the death-blow, which he saw aimed against him; but ere he could prevent it, that blow was given, and his father had fallen. With uncontrollable fury, he rushed to meet his terrible antagonist, who perceived him, while he was yet some paces distant; and redashing his spurs into his horse, darted towards him. The horses met with a dreadful momentum, and were both overthrown. But in an instant, their riders had gained their feet. The same instant they recognised each other, and paused, as if surprise had for a moment paralyzed their strength. Edward first exclaimed, “M`Cauley!” “Barrymore!” was the immediate reply. That moment Edward heard a groan from his father as some person raised him from the ground. “Villain! die! you have killed my father,” he shouted, flying with the force and agility of a lion on his antagonist, who, however, coolly parried the attack without returning it, crying out, at the same time, “By the life of him you saved from the gallows! Barrymore, I will not hurt you, if you should slay me on the spot.” An instinctive feeling of reluctance to destroy a man thus voluntarily throwing himself in his power, occasioned Edward to desist from the attack. Another of the insurgents now rode forward, crying out, “Slay him, M`Cauley! Down with the young traitor. Had you slain him when I advised you, at the Point Rock, you would not now have to fight him. But, by God! there's another traitor that I'll smite to the earth.” He had that moment seen Jemmy Hunter, who was advancing to Edward's assistance. He hastened towards him, exclaiming, “Accursed villain! I owe you a deadly debt. Receive this!” But before he could wield his weapon, Jemmy's sabre had fallen with well-aimed and resistless force, on his neck; and his head hung half severed from his body, as if a school-boy's wand had broken down the head of a thistle, and he immediately reeled from his horse. “Darragh! you were owre lang a gettin' this,” cried Jemmy. “Had I gein ye't a twal month ago in M`Gorley's stable in Larne, ye would hae gane to your lang hame wi' fewer sins on your head.” “Is it you, traitor!” cried M`Cauley; “but you shall pay for it;” and he aimed a fierce and sudden blow at Hunter. But the stroke was dexterously avoided, although it did not fall without mischief, for Hunter's horse received it in his neck, and tumbled to the ground. M`Cauley would have repeated the blow with fatal effect, had not Edward sprung forward, and struck the falling blade with such force that it almost forsook its owner's grasp. “Desperate wretch!” cried he, “will you commit another murder in my sight, and expect I will look tamely on it? Ah! hear you my father's groans? O Heaven! he has been slain by an assassin—a monster!” “Assassin!” reiterated M`Cauley, assuming the countenance of a fiend—“By Heaven! that word has sealed thy doom.—Away with it!” cried he, as if he was discharging some troublesome feeling that seemed tenaciously to harbour in his breast; “away!—all regard for the preserver of O'Halloran is now fled.” So saying, he withdrew a step backwards, as if to come forward with a surer aim, and redoubled force. Edward met him with equal force; and his father's groans still ringing in his ears, with a higher degree of rage than he had ever before felt. Fury flashed from the eyes of both, and when their weapons met the clash shook the air, the fiery sparks fell around them, and they both reeled with the concussion. Edward was an expert and educated swordsman; and he now applied his science for his safety. A forward thrust by M`Cauley, who conceived that he had a fair opportunity for such a manœuvre, was so well observed and so dexterously turned aside, that the weapon passed without doing injury, while Edward's was instantly buried in his antagonist's body, who fell, but uttered not a groan. Edward immediately ran to his father, whom he found almost speechless. But on hearing his son's voice he faintly uttered, “Pursue the enemy!” A sense of public duty rushed on Edward's mind, and mounting the horse of a man whom he ordered to remain with his father to support him and keep his wound staunched, he galloped after his men, who had again discomfited the insurgent party, and were just commencing a new pursuit. Having followed them to the very verge of their camp, which was now getting fast into confusion, he withdrew them back to the scene of his late action, in good order, no attempt being made by the enemy to follow them. Indeed by this time the attention of the insurgents all over the hill was principally engaged in providing for their own safety. Cornwallis had ordered a large party of both horse and foot to march by the passage over the stream, that had been discovered as before mentioned, for the purpose of out flanking the enemy's left, while his powerful artillery continued to commit great havoc among them in front. As soon as this detachment reached its destination, and opened its fire, the insurgents on the whole of the left and rear of the French, fled in all directions, and were pursued with a too terrible slaughter by the cavalry. General Humbert seeing that it was in vain to resist longer, hoisted the white flag. The firing immediately ceased on both sides, and after a short negociation, the French having lost about one third of their number, surrendered themselves prisoners of war. The insurgents to the right of the French, now followed the example of those who had occupied the left; and in a short time, there was no enemy to be seen on the field. Being persuaded that the rebels were thoroughly dispersed, and that there was no danger of them rallying again to give any more disturbance, from motives of humanity, the viceroy soon ordered the pursuit to cease, so that this complete and decisive victory, which terminated the disasterous insurrection of 1798, was achieved with far less bloodshed than from the numbers arrayed on both sides, previous to the engagement, could have been expected. This was undoubtedly owing to the judicious and humane plan which the viceroy took to disperse the insurgents, rather by intimidation than actual slaughter, in which he completely succeeded, as well as to his ordering the pursuit to be so soon relinquished. It was fortunate also, that there were few such resolute and daring men among the Southern conspirators as M`Cauley, otherwise the resistance, and consequently the slaughter, would have been infinitely greater. That unfortunate man, on hearing of the landing of the French, had left his concealment at the Gabbons, and, in company with Darragh, and eight or nine more of the proscribed Northerns, joined the invaders on their march from Castlebar to Tuam. These men all met with their death in this engagement. When Edward had obtained accommodations for his father in the house of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, and had left him under surgical care, he returned with Jemmy Hunter to where M`Cauley and Darragh lay, in order to ascertain their fate. The latter was dead. He had died almost instantly, his head, as has been already observed, having been nearly separated from his body. The former was still alive; but very much exhausted. Edward proposed that he should be carried to a house, and receive the care of a surgeon; but to this he would not consent. “Here,” said he, “is the most honourable place for me to die, and I rejoice that my death has been occasioned by honourable hands. My life was rendered miserable, but my spirits were never depressed; nor was I ever so irresolute as to abandon my purpose, for fear of dying an ignominious death;—and Providence has been kinder to me than I perhaps deserved. I have not always squared my actions by the rules of conduct, or the notions of morality generally adopted by men. An instinctive perception—some might call it the impulse of feeling, but I have flattered myself that it was the dictate of conscience that generally directed me in my path, and pointed out what I should do. To neglect the inspirations of this instinct, which I had made my guide, I considered as great a crime as to infringe the prohibitions of a divine law; and the most questionable action of my life, the destruction of M`Bride, I considered a positive duty, because it was suggested by this regulator of my conduct. “Mr. Barrymore, I die because I was an assassin, as you please to term it; for had you not enraged me by pronouncing a word which I considered an insult, I should not have fought you; and you would not have slain me; neither could you have done so to-day, had I been naturally of a more blood-thirsty disposition, for then, fifteen months ago, I should have taken the advice of the wretched man who lies there, and sent you unseen, or unheard of, to the grave. But my inward monitor forbade me, and I dared not do it. And now, if I have really been such a pest to the world, such a monster of mischief to society, as my enemies have called me, by my own forbearance you have lived to avenge the world, and rid society of me. “Hear now my last words; for I feel that I shall not be able to speak much longer. Let not my death misgive you any thing; for to you it was no crime. Vexation for the fall of a beloved father, prompted you to utter harsh expressions; these expressions occasioned my death, by causing me to draw upon you. But it is a death I rejoice in; the death of a Hampden, on the field of glory, in my country's cause, and by the hand of an honourable man. What can be a happier consummation! But, oh! farewell. Tell O'Halloran that I died blessing my country.” The last words were almost inaudible, and he expired in a few minutes after uttering them. When Edward beheld him dead, his heart smote him. “It is the first death that has ever been occasioned by my hand,” he exclaimed—“And, oh! may heaven grant that neither duty nor accident may prevent it from being the last!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XXIII. What is the worst of woes that wait on age? What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow To view each loved one blotted from life's page, And be alone on earth as I am now. Before the chast'ner humbly let me bow, O'er hearts divided, and o'er hopes destroyed; Roll on vain days, full reckless may ye flow, Since time has 'reft what'er my soul enjoyed! Byron. When Edward returned to his father, he was given to understand that the latter had not many hours to live. “Oh father!” cried he, catching his hand and bathing it in tears; “how soon has it pleased God to take you from me! You have been to me a good father. You have ever been to me an example, a director and a friend. Ah! who can to me supply your place?” “Edward,” said his father, “grieve not thus. I must now repeat what I have often inculcated on you. Bear misfortunes with the spirit of a man, and the resignation of a christian. Show yourself, whether in prosperity or in adversity, worthy of the house of Barrymore. It is useless, it is unbecoming, to lament in this manner. And why should we lament for the result of this day? It ought to be esteemed a day of rejoicing, and not of grief. We have crushed a mighty rebellion; and ere I die, I have the satisfaction to know that the decisiveness of this day's victory, has secured to my country, and my children, the blessings of just laws, and a well regulated government,—a government equally removed from despotism and anarchy.” Vol. II. s “These, my son, are blessings worth fighting for, worth dying for. Edward if you inherit any of your father's principles and feelings, you will not, if fate requires it, regret to die for them. When you have children I know you will not, for the power of transmitting such a legacy as our incomparably happy form of government, cannot be purchased too dear. Ah! what would be my pangs on this death-bed, if I perceived the enemies of that truly free and rational government, triumphant, and all its wise and venerable institutions in danger of being subverted by the demons of anarchy, bigotry and massacre. But thank God! in the midst of my country's madness, in the midst of her delirious attempts at self-destruction, the weapon has been wrested from her hand; and although, in the blind fury of her paroxysm, she has inflicted dreadful wounds on her welfare and prosperity, yet, I trust, that the regenerating soundness of her constitution will soon repair her injuries, and restore her once more to vigour and happiness. “Your mother, and your sister, will now look to you as their protector. I know that you will treat them with all the care and tenderness, with which I have treated them. Be to them in my stead;—be to your country in my stead.” “My father,” cried Edward, “I shall, with all my soul, endeavour to be so. But who shall be to me in your stead?” His father paused a few moments, and then replied. “My son, you have a heavenly father; never, never forget that. But there is also one man on earth to whom, if he will accept them, I will resign my rights over you. I hope he will be to you a parent, such as I have been. I wish to see Sir Francis Hamilton.” That gentleman in company with the Lord Lieutenant, was just approaching to enquire after his situation. When they entered his apartment, “My lord,” said he, “I congratulate you and the country, on this day's victory. I hope it will terminate this unnatural rebellion.” “I hope so,” replied the viceroy; “but we have purchased it dearly, with your loss.” “My lord, I am happy to die in such a manner, and in such a cause. My country will experience but little injury, for I shall leave her this young man, my only son, to fill my place; and to him, Sir Francis Hamilton,” said he, looking at that gentleman, “I wish you to fill mine. I am no stranger to his ardent attachment to your daughter; and although I have never seen her, the circumstances of her being your child, and his choice, are to me sufficient for wishing her to become his wife; and if you have no objection to receive him as your son-in-law, when I am no more, the reflection that he has such a prospect of happiness before him, will contribute much to sooth my dying moments.” Sir Francis grasping the hand of the patient, which was extended to him, replied, “I am sorry that my Edward, for I will now call him mine, so soon, so suddenly loses such a father. With all my heart and soul, I shall endeavour, however imperfectly, to supply the loss; for if I were to search the whole civilized world, I should not find a man, whom my heart would prefer to him, as a husband for my daughter.” “Then, Edward,” said the Colonel, “give me your hand. May you soon be happy with the woman of your choice; and may Heaven bless you and her with every virtue that may entitle you to happiness!” Not many hours after this, Colonel Barrymore closed his eyes upon all earthly scenes. His body was carried to Dublin, and thence to Barrymount, the family seat, and there buried with his fathers, in the presence of a large concourse of real mourners. His brother the Earl, being now much advanced in life, for he was upwards of fifteen years older than the Colonel, laid his death so much to heart, they having ever lived on the most affectionate footing, that from being only infirm, he became diseased, and soon felt such a change for the worse in his constitution, that he prognosticated that he was speedily approaching to his last illness. “And I am content that it should be so,” said he to Edward's mother and sister, (who now resided at Barrymount for the purpose of giving him their society) for since my beloved brother has left this world, it is become to me a world of desolation. O! I wish, fervently wish to follow him to that world of happiness, which he now inhabits, and where when we once meet, we shall never part.” In the meantime Edward's heart panted to visit the North. But he could not with propriety leave his uncle in his present precarious situation. He, however, in almost daily letters, poured forth the ardour of his soul to his beloved, and received from her regular replies, which formed his only consolation during his present afflictions. One day his uncle called him to his bed-side. “Edward,” said he, “on you will soon devolve the duty of supporting, in the world, the name, rank, and respectability of our family, which I am proud to say has never yet been tarnished by a mean or an unprincipled act. There is nothing in the world I value so highly, as this family reputation. I received it pure from my ancestors, and neither your father nor I, have, thank God! done any thing to sully it. To you it shall soon be committed as a sacred trust. You will guard, therefore, with solicitude, and transmit it to your posterity as pure as you found it; and may heaven grant you a virtuous offspring to know its value, and perpetuate its purity!” “There is one thing in which, if you can indulge me, you will afford me great gratification. I understand that your father, on his death-bed, gave his assent to your marriage with a lady in the county of Antrim, to whom you are attached. I should be glad before I die to see that lady, whose conduct is to have such influence on the future reputation of the name of Barrymore; for, on the mother of a family, the transmission of its character depends more than on any other individual. You may deem such a desire as this whimsical; and, perhaps, with respect to the lady, not altogether delicate. But it is surely natural that I should be desirous to see the mother of the future Barrymores. From the lady my desire may be kept concealed; consequently no wound will be given to her delicacy. Her father, without any impropriety, may introduce her to your mother and sister, as a friend; and I am sure he would not object to do so if he knew how ardently I wish it.” Edward conceived that it would be fruitless as well as cruel to oppose this strange fancy of his uncle. Besides he was secretly pleased with the opportunity it afforded of soliciting Sir Francis to bring his daughter to this part of the country. “To the North,” said he to himself, “my thoughts every day, every hour, every minute, direct themselves. But, if Ellen were here, I should not think of the North.” The next day he rode into the city; and stated simply to Sir Francis, his uncle's request, together with its motives. Sir Francis made no hesitation in soliciting his daughter and O'Halloran to visit the metropolis, which they did in little more than a week afterwards. In a few days, he drove them Vol. II. s 2 to Barrymount, on a visit to the old Earl's, with whom he had of late became intimate. Edward had received intelligence of the day on which they were to arrive. How did his heart beat with joyful impatience! He rose that morning earlier than usual; for he could not sleep. The day which he had thus rendered longer than ordinary, appeared to him preternaturally so. Many an anxious look he cast at his watch. “The deuce take it, it will never be the afternoon,” thought he. He was almost tempted to move the hands of the watch forward; but he reflected that such a measure would add no velocity to the wheels of Sir Francis's coach. He then tried to read; but it would not do. He then tried to walk, but it was equally vain. He next had recourse to writing a letter to Martin, but he dated it wrong; took another sheet of paper, wrote “my dear Sir,” twice; and, in the first line, instead of the word “pleasure,” wrote “perplexity;” and, in the second, for the words, “I learn you are still at home,” he substituted, “I think she will surely soon come.” He dashed the pen across the lines, execrated his stupidity, and gave it up as an impracticable task. He then threw himself on a sofa; and bravely determined, since he could not get rid of his impatience, to bear it like a man. He lay for about five minutes quiet enough; and then looked around. “Charlotte,” said he to his sister, who was present, “Charlotte, my dear, what o'clock is it?” “Why, Edward, you have asked me that question, I believe, ten times since breakfast.” “Is it two, my dear?” “No, I believe it is scarcely one. But consult your watch.” “I have consulted it twenty times to-day; but I cannot think it right. It goes very slow. Well, well, if it were two, and it wants but an hour and twenty minutes of it, it would then be only three hours till five.—But, Charlotte, wont you take a ride? I shall order the chaise.” “I shall go with you in an hour, Edward.” In short they took their ride, met Sir Francis's coach, returned in company with it to the Earl's; and Edward's time for about ten days, the duration of Ellen's visit, flew with the rapidity of a delicious dream. It is needless to say that the Earl was well pleased, when he beheld the lovely mother of the future Barrymores. “Upon my honour,” said he to Edward, the evening after Ellen had left them, “you are a happy young man. No wonder you spent so much time in the North, where you discovered such a beautious flower ripening into perfection. If Providence would only spare me to behold your eldest son, I think that there might yet be attractions for me even in this world. But no, I must hasten to your father and my brother, to my God, his God, and your God.” Accordingly in less than three weeks afterwards, he resigned his spirit into the hands of him who made it, and his earthly remains were deposited amidst his kindred dust, along side of his brother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XXIV. Enough of this. To deal in wordy compliment Is much against the plainness of my nature; I judge you by myself, a clear true spirit, And as such join you to my bosom— Farewell, and be my friend. Rowe. The deceased Earl had never possessed any children. His title, therefore, together with his immense property, devolved on Edward, who in a very short period, took occasion, in company with nis mother and sister, to visit the North, and lay them at the feet of Ellen. “My lord!” said she, as he warmly pressed for an immediate union, “it would be mere affectation in me to deny what you already know, that my heart pleads in your favour. But I am at my father's disposal, and must request you to wait till his consent be obtained in form.” “Then, my love, you may name the happy day,” he replied, “for before I left Dublin, I obtained Sir Francis's promise that he would follow me here, in a few days, to be present at our nuptials.” “Then, my lord,” she answered, “when he comes we may permit him to name it.” When she had said this, her countenance changed, she blushed deeply, and looking to the ground, almost burst into tears. “What is the matter, my Ellen?” enquired the young Earl, who was himself considerably agitated. “Oh!” said she, “the word has passed my lips. I have committed my liberty into your hands. I cannot now recall it. The change is awful!” “Surely, sweetest Ellen, you do not wish to recall it.” “No, my lord, otherwise I should not have said it. I have said it deliberately, willingly, and without scruple. But it brings to my mind the recollection of the freedom I have hitherto enjoyed, in parting with which I cannot help shedding a few natural tears. Besides, I cannot without concern, contemplate the high responsibility of the station I am about to fill. Should I fail in any part of my duty—” “My Ellen!” he interrupted her, “my treasure, be comforted. It is impossible that one of your goodness of heart and understanding, can fail in any duty. As to the station, you will adorn it. You will be an example to our peeresses of all that is virtuous, lovely, dignified, and wise. In the eyes of your Edward, station cannot exalt you. He found you among these rocks, on this romantic shore, a jewel of perfection, valuable beyond all price, and such a one as in his estimation, no change of scene or circumstance, neither humiliation nor exaltation, can alter. He will soon move you to a more busy and brilliant sphere, where, while every eye admires your lustre, and every heart acknowledges your value, you will still be to him, as you have been here, the pride, the delight of his soul, the dearest part of himself.” But it would be tedious to detail the whole of his love conversation, which lasted nearly three hours, as every one in the Castle, who knew they were together, felt unwilling to disturb them; and Mrs. Brown had the good nature to postpone making tea for a whole hour after the usual time, rather than interrupt their agreeable tete-a-tete. Tea was, however, at length, got ready; and when the lovers were summoned to attend, they could scarcely be convinced that the old lady had not prepared it much earlier than usual. On their entering the parlour, Edward's sister maliciously consulted her watch. “It is past seven o'clock,” said she. “Past seven o'clock!” cried his lordship. “Why, Charlotte, your watch must be wrong. I cannot suppose it to be more than five.” “That is owing to your having been in pleasant company,” said she. “Time does not now lag with your lordship, as it did at Barrymount one day, when you insisted that it was two o'clock when it was hardly past twelve; and in sheer pity, I had to drive away in a chaise with you, to try to make it move faster.” “Ah! Charlotte, you may now laugh;—but, I hope, I shall yet have my revenge, by observing your little heart beating impatiently for the arrival of an esteemed friend.” “And a dearly beloved one too,” added she, with emphasis. “Yes, my sister,” said he, “and may he who can excite similar emotions in your heart, be as worthy of love, as the object who occasioned that day's impatience in mine!” “Amen,” she replied. The tea-table was scarcely removed, when Miss Barrymore, looking from a window, exclaimed, “Why, my lord, I declare, yonder is the old beggar woman you left an invalid on our hands, when you set off so hastily from Dublin in June last. His lordship looked out, and beheld Peg Dornan advancing briskly up the avenue. She had become perfectly convalescent, and had returned from Dublin during the time that Edward was employed in Cornwallis's army; and was now a fund of great entertainment to the whole neighbourhood, for several miles round, by her inexhaustible descriptions of the great city, and the great folks in it. She was soon heard addressing one of the servants. “I'm tauld he's come,” said she, “an' I'll wait here till I see him, for I hae na cast an ee on him syne the day he left me in sic a hurry, in his father's hoose, a perfect cripple, wi' my twa shanks as thick as butter-firkins, an' my feet blistered like broiled herrin's. An' the bit lassie, his sister—Gude bless her bonnie face. She gied me baith wine an' plenty o' sweetmeats every day, whilk was a great comfort to a puir body in a muckle wild toon sae far frae hame.” “Old Peg has a good heart,” said Edward. “I must go to speak with her.” O'Halloran went with him. “Fare fa' you!” quoth she, making a low courtesy as soon as she saw them. “I may be owre bauld; but I wished to see his honour, wha, they tell me, is noo a young lord, yince mair.” “Well, Peg, how have you been, since we parted?” asked his lordship. “Weel enough for a poor body like me; but I'm still better noo since I see you whare you oucht to be; an' since I hear you're sune gaun to get wha' I aye thoucht you should get.” “Peg!” replied Edward, “you have rendered us many and great services. I shall have a little cottage built for you, in which you can spend your old days in comfort.” “I thank you, kindly,” she said, “but you need na be at the pains. His honour there, my auld master an' frien', has already gi'en me a snug yin; an' he lets me besides hae a hantel o' siller every week; indeed mair than I ken weel what to do wi', for I can neither wear it, nor eat it; an' ye ken it wad na be richt to drink it. But, gin it wad na be makin' owre free, I would like to see the bonny bairn your sister, wha was sae kind to me when I was a bedrill in Dublin.” At that instant Miss Barrymore made her appearance. “My bonnie lady,” said Peg, courtesying to her, “I was unco troublesome to you up the country, an' I just wanted to thank you, noo when I'm won back to my ain country.” “I'm glad to see you so stout, Peg!” said the young lady. “If it would na affront you,” returned Peg, abruptly, “to tak' a gift frae an auld beggar wife, I would fain gie you a pretty thing I fan' among the stanes near the Point Rock, yestreen, as I was saunterin' alang gathering limpits.” While saying this, she unfolded a piece of old rag, and presented to view a handsome gold broach, set with diamonds, of great value. Edward instantly recognised it as one that he had lost when struggling with the waves on the evening which had so nearly proved fatal to him. His sister also knew it to be his. “Why, Peg, you have been fortunate yesterday,” said his lordship. “That broach was once mine. It was valued at two hundred guineas, and you are entitled to that sum. How will you dispose of it?” “Dispose of it! In trowth, I'll no dispose of it at all,” she replied; “for I'll no hae't at all. Gin the breest-pin be yours, you maun get it. But I thoucht to pay the debt I owed to this bonnie lassie, wi' it.” “She shall have it since you desire it,” said his lordship, “but you must also derive some benefit from your good fortune in finding it. Mention any thing I can do for you.” “Weel, since I think o't, maybe you'll no' object to tak' Jock Dornan, my poor gomerill sin— but he's a sturdy chiel—into your service; an' try to mak' a man o' him, whilk is mair than ever his mither could.” “It shall be so,” said his lordship; “and he shall be amply provided for. And now, Charlotte, you may take the broach, as a present, from Peg.” “I shall,” she said, “but Peg must receive from me in return, a new bonnet and a new cloak every year.” “Whate'er you like!” replied Peg.” I'll refuse naething o' that sort. But I'll awa an' sen' Jock Dornan to you in the mornin'. Guid een, an' the blessing o' an auld woman be wi' you a'.” When she was gone, O'Halloran informed his lordship that after her return from Dublin, in consequence of her active instrumentality in saving his life, he felt himself bound to provide for her future comfort; and had bestowed her a cottage, and settled on her a weekly allowance during her life, which, considering her careless and wandering disposition, he observed was a more effectual way of rewarding her, than by the actual donation of a more considerable sum of money, or a larger piece of property.” Edward being desirous to see M`Nelvin, O'Halloran and he walked to Jemmy Hunter's with the expectation of finding him there. It was a fine moonlight evening, about the middle of October. The grain harvest was all gathered in; and the country people had been busied during the day in raising and securing the potatoes, and as our friends went along, they passed many car-loads of this wholesome and agreeable root, so precious to the Irish, on their way to the farm-houses. The peasantry were cheerful and civil, and seemed to have completely recovered their spirits after the late disastrous events. Vol. II. T On arriving at Jemmy Hunter's, all was quiet around the dwelling house, for it was now dark, and candles were lighted within. After the capture of the French, Jemmy, whose habits of life were not formed for dependence on the great, and whose domestic attachments were too strong to permit his long continuance from his family, relinquished his situation under Sir Francis Hamilton, and returned home. On Barrymore and O'Halloran approaching close to the house, the cheering sounds of rustic mirth and happiness saluted their ears. “Come here,” said O'Halloran, who had advanced to the unscreened window of the apartment in which the contented group were sitting round a large blazing turf fire, “Come here, my lord, and behold a true specimen of the winter-night enjoyments of our Northern peasantry.” Barrymore looked, and his heart swelled with joy to behold a number of as healthy, honest and happy human countenances, as any family group in Christendom could exhibit. Between the window and the fire-place, sat four women, busily employed at the spinning wheel, the chief engine of the Northern Irish industry and prosperity. These were Jemmy Hunter's mother, his two sisters, and his wife. On the other side of the hearth, in a large arm chair, sat William Caldwell, who, from the staff in his hand, and the great coat that hung loosely on his shoulders, appeared to have just come on an evening visit to his son-in-law. M`Nelvin, Jemmy Hunter, and a decent looking young man whom Barrymore did not know, but who, it will be no harm to suppose, was a suitor to one of the Miss Hunters, sat in front of the hearth; while on a long bench between the hearth and a stone wall, which ran across the apartment, sat two ruddy faced youths, younger brothers to Jemmy, one of whom had the house-dog, which was of the large black species, called in that part of the country, the “Collie,” between his knees. To some remark of M`Nelvin, which Edward did not hear, old Caldwell replied, “I'm very happy at the turn things hae ta'en; an' I'm sure a' the country will be rejoiced at it, for he's a guid youth.” “Father,” said Jemmy, “Peggy can sing you yin o' the best sangs ye hae heard this lang time; an' its a new yin. She gat it frae M`Nelvin here. I listened to her singing it last nicht, till I amaist grat, it touched me sae much. Come, Peggy, let your father hear it; it will do his heart guid.” After some little hesitation, Peggy complied, and sang as follows: A BALLAD. Oh! thousands shall mourn, and thousands shall fall, And ruin shall light upon castle and hall; And our chieftain shall forfeit his bonnie estate, And be sentenced to die at his own castle gate; And the Flower of the North, her sire shall wail, And the Pride of the South shall hear the tale, And, with speed, shall hasten our chief to free, For the sake of the Flower of the North country. “I fear not death,” our brave chieftain said, “But my daughter is fair, and I fear for the maid: To be friendless and lovely, are evils in store, To work her misfortune, when I am no more.” Then burst from her bosom the heart-breaking sighs, And the tears fall fast from her lovely black eyes; As she said to her father, “O grieve not for me, For, to peace, in the grave, I shall soon follow thee!” The guards move slow, for their errand is death, While the foes of our chieftain are foaming with wrath; But the noble youth follows on mercy's swift wings, And life and estate to our chieftain he brings. Now the land rejoices, our bosoms beat high, And maids and their lovers sing songs of joy; For the Pride of the South soon married shall be, To Ellen, the Flower of the North country. “Why, M`Nelvin!” said Jemmy, clapping the poet on the knee, when the song was ended, “you deserve a fairin' for making it. I wonder man hoo you can gar the words clink sae?” But before the poet could reply, a rapping at the door drew the attention of the party. “Come in, frien's!” cried Jemmy, rising at the same time, to open the door. The next moment Edward and O'Halloran advanced, and saluted the company. They all rose. The women made courtesies, and the men bows. “Ah! how are you, M`Nelvin!” cried Edward, ardently shaking the poet by the hand. “Your friend, Sir Francis, sent his kind respects to you. I expect him to follow me here in a few days.” “My lord, I am really rejoiced to see you,” replied the bard. “I need not say that the present prospects of both you and that best of my friends, afford me much happiness.” Edward now turned to salute William Caldwell and the rest of the company. “Mr. Caldwell,” said he, “it gives me true pleasure to witness your good fortune, in being surrounded by such an amiable and happy group of relatives.” “We maun thank your lordship for some o' our happiness,” replied the old man. “What you did for his honour there, will no' sune be forgotten amang us.” By this time Peggy had her neat little parlour lighted; and, with all the winning sweetness of rural modesty, invited her guests to step ben to it, as she said, “it was a decenter place for the like o' them than the kitchen,” the apartment in which they had met. A pitcher of warm whiskey punch soon diffused its inspiring fumes through the room. “How did you like the city, Jemmy?” asked Lord Barrymore. “You seemed very anxious to leave it.” “I liked it weel enough; an' had it no' been for twa folk, an' there is yin o' them,” said he, pointing to his blushing Peggy, “an' the ither is in the craddle yonder, I wadna hae left Sir Francis sae sune.—Peggy, bring here the wean, till his lordship sees it. It's a bonnie bit thing, an' I hae ca'd it for you, my lord.” His spouse, now, with an almost trembling fondness, produced the young Hunter to view. “Eddy, Eddy!” cried its father, catching its little hand, “look up, my boy, an' see your namesake.” His lordship took the child in his arms. “It is a fine boy, Jemmy,” said he; “its features are extremely like your own. I do not wonder that you were impatient to return to objects so attractive as such a wife and such a son. I thought, my friend, to add to your happiness for the many great services you have rendered me, but I find it impossible; for these treasures make you happier than man can make you. Yet you will permit me to make my little namesake a present, in token of my esteem for his parents, and my affection for himself.” He then returned the child to its mother, and requested some writing materials, with which being supplied, he drew forth a valuable gold watch, and cutting a piece of paper into a circular form, so as to fit the inside of the watch, he wrote on it as follows: “Oct. 17, 1798. The gift of Edward, earl of Barrymore, to Edward Hunter. The earl hereby binds himself and his heirs forever, to pay annually fifty pounds sterling to the said Edward Hunter and his heirs.” He enclosed the paper within the watch, and Vol. II. T 2 handing it to Peggy, “Receive this in trust for your child,” said he; “it is but a small recompense for the numerous and important services his father has rendered to me, and those dear to me.” When Jemmy understood the nature of the gift, “Na, na,” said he, “we'll no' hae't: it is owre muckle, my lord. It was na for ony such thing that I helped you in your pinches. It was for mere frien'ship; an' I would hae done the same for ony frien' in the country.” “This disinterestedness,” observed his lordship, “makes you still the more entitled to recompense. But if you will not receive this gift, as a reward, you will gratify me by receiving it as a token of friendship, for I am proud of being capable of exciting such friendship as you have shown for me. Besides, Jemmy, it is scarcely in your power to refuse it, for it is not to you, but to your son, my young namesake here, that I give it.” “Weel, weel, gin it maun be sae, let it be sae,” replied Jemmy. “But I think the young rascal has got owre mony presents already; for Miss O'Halloran has gien him hale trunkfu's o' cleas an' ither things, mair, I believe, than we ken weel hoo to use. An' I'll no' hide it, though it is a secret she does na hersel' ken; it was mair to please her than to compliment ony body else, that we ca'd him Edward.” “Candidly confessed!” cried lord Barrymore, much pleased with Jemmy's simplicity; but, at the same time, more delighted with the idea that Ellen had displayed such attention to a child that was named after himself. “I canna weel tell what to think o' ye, gentlemen,” remarked Jemmy. “Ye seem to care naething o' the warld's gear. His honour, there, Mr. O'Halloran, has gien me the farm rent free forever; an' would insist on me that it was paying a debt he owed me, whereas I only did for either o' you, what yae neighbour should be aye ready to do for anither. But let us hae anither glass. Wi' your leave, I'll drink lang life to you, Mr. O'Halloran; an' lang life to your lordship, an' may ye sune be married to her ye like best!” Having thanked Jemmy for his good wishes, and emptied their glasses to a toast expressive of theirs for him and his interesting family, O'Halloran and lord Barrymore arose, and, accompanied by M`Nelvin and Jemmy, proceeded towards the castle. On their way, the poet and his lordship having fallen somewhat behind their companions, “Mr. M`Nelvin,” said the latter, “the obligations I lie under to you, for your ardent and effective services in the behalf of me, and those I love, demand my sincere acknowledgments, and embolden me to make a request, your compliance with which will afford me much satisfaction, as it will give me an opportunity of making some return for the numerous favours you have conferred on me.” “Any service I have rendered your lordship,” replied M`Nelvin, “brought with it its own reward, in the gratification I experienced in the performance; and if there be any I can yet render you, let me know it, and, with the same zeal and pleasure, it shall be done.” “In the county of Cavan,” said his lordship, “I have an estate, the manager of which died a few months ago. I should like you to fill his place, for I want it filled with a man in whose honesty to myself, and attention to the comforts and happiness of my tenantry, I can confide. The compensation of the late agent was £500 per annum; yours shall be £300.” “I see, my lord, your motive for this generous offer,” returned M`Nelvin. “You wish to make me independent as to worldly matters; and your friendship and delicacy have suggested this method. I thank you, sincerely do I thank you. But, my lord, my affections are rooted to this part of the country. The neighbourhood for about ten miles round us, is all the world to me. It is all I ever enjoyed or ever wish to enjoy. In an adjoining valley I had my birth; amidst these hills I was educated; every thing that has interested me from the days of childhood to this very hour, has appeared within these limits; and, if I were to remove from them, I should remove from that portion of the world, which could alone yield me enjoyment by interesting my affections. On your estate, I should feel as if I were exiled from my native land; and although it would yield me pleasure to afford you any assistance in my power in managing your affairs, yet, as I know that your lordship can sustain no injury by my present refusal, there being numerous individuals who would be thankful for such an employment, better qualified both from experience and disposition to fulfil its duties than I am, I decline your friendly offer, with the less reluctance. My lord, while I refuse your kindness in this instance, I trust that you are too fully aware of the nature of my motives for so doing, to take them amiss. Indeed, I assure your lordship, that the governorship of the richest of his majesty's colonies, would not tempt me to forego the pleasure of every day beholding my native hills and vallies; the pleasure of wandering, in my hours of meditation, along those streamlets, or concealing myself amidst those well known groves and glens; or of enjoying in my hours of sociability, the cheerful hospitality, and kindly, though rustic conversation, of those beloved friends and neighbours, to whom I have been long accustomed and endeared.” “Is there no other way, my romantic friend,” inquired his lordship, “by which I can manifest my gratitude for what you have done for me?” “There is no other way,” replied the poet, “than by continuing to favour me with your good opinion. As to pecuniary matters, they are of little or no consideration with me. I need but little, and that little I can easily earn. To possess more, might only produce cares and perplexities with which I wish not to be encumbered. My days may be few or many, as Providence shall please to order, but they shall be spent in the indulgence of affections which wealth cannot excite, and in the enjoyment of those luxuries of mind it cannot purchase.” “Happy M`Nelvin,” exclaimed his lordship, “since you have thus the making of your own happiness, independent of the frowns or the smiles of a fickle world! I shall not urge you further on this subject. But assure yourself of my lasting friendship and gratitude; and of my sincere wish that you may long live to enjoy the intellectual blessings of which you are enamoured, amidst the interesting scenery of your native vales, and in possession of the esteem and admiration of their honest inhabitants.” Having now arrived at the avenue to the Castle, they separated, and the poet returned with Hunter to the rural dwelling of the latter, which had of late become his favourite place of residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XXV. The most delightful lot beneath the sun, Is when two faithful hearts that fondly love, By sacred rites are made for ever one, While bounteous fortune smiles, and friends approve. Their's are the exalted joys of saints above, Each word, each look, imparting mutual bliss: On rapturous wings their golden moments move; Nor can they wish a happier world than this, For holy wedded love, turns earth to Paradise. Irish Soothsayer. As this history is drawing to a close, it may not be amiss to take notice of the great lesson for the inclucation of which, it has been written; namely, that intimidation and vengeance are, and ever will be, unsuccessful in preserving the peace of a country; whereas conciliation and kindness will scarcely ever fail. The blood of martyrs has been truly said to be like seed to the cause for which they suffer; and perhaps, in no portion of the history of nations, has this truth been more clearly illustrated, than in that we have just recited. The unnecessary, unjust, impolitic, and cruel execution of William Orr, almost instantaneously resulted in thousands of William Orrs, or rather of characters such as he was accused of being, starting into existence, and vowing revenge upon his persecutors. While Camden governed in Ireland, the system which occasioned that irritating execution, was continued until it involved the country into all the horrors of which we have in the preceding pages, given a faint sketch. How long these horrors would have continued, had he continued to govern, is happily now only matter of conjecture. The realization of the evils, which the most enlightened statesmen of both England and Ireland, predicted would be the consequence of his coercive measures, brought at length conviction of their impropriety home to the minds of the British ministers; and he was suddenly, and fortunately superseded in his office, by a man of a more enlightened understanding and a more humane temper. The almost immediate consequence of this happy change we have seen. In the course of a few months, rebellion was converted into submission, and disaffection into loyalty. With the restoration of the ordinary laws, confidence in the government, tranquillity, industry, and national prosperity were also restored. It is true that the flames of the civil war had been too extensive for its dying embers to be all at once extinguished; and amidst a numerous population, it could not be expected, but that some would fanatically continue to urge the prosecution of desperate measures, even after their abandonment by the general mass Besides the government, comparatively mild and merciful, as it was still, displayed, in some instances, a harshness towards several proscribed individuals, which kept alive, for a considerable time, a soreness in the minds of many, who would otherwise have returned at once to their former habits and feelings of loyalty. But as these unfortunate individuals, against whom the national authority continued to direct its vengeance with unabated rigour, were all, in the course of some months, either taken and executed, or died in their coverts from the hardships they endured, or else found means to fly from the country, this source of irritation and danger, became also, before the expiration of the year, removed. Indeed, about that period, so evidently had the majority of the people of the North became loyal, that it seemed, by their conduct and expressions, as if a species of re-action had taken place in their feelings; and the government appeared so much convinced that these professions were sincere, that it scrupled not to entrust arms into the hands of thousands who had been active in the rebellion. A species of military force, denominated “Yeomanry,” the members of which could not be taken out of their own county, were not liable to military law, and had the privilege of withdrawing whenever they pleased, from the service, had been projected sometime previous to the insurrection; but, on account of the general disaffection, had been joined but by few. Its ranks, however, were now swelled by multitudes, eager to evince their reawakened fidelity to the government, which was therefore soon enabled to withdraw the regular troops from the country, and despatch them against the foreign enemy. It is true that, previous to the arrival of Cornwallis, and the adoption of healing measures, although the insurrection had been nearly suppressed, the minds of the people were still much agitated; and there existed in the country such causes of irritation, as would, in all probability, have occasioned it to become once more a scene of bloodshed and terror; and, on the first favourable opportunity, there is scarcely a doubt that another rising would have taken place, if a period had not been put to Camden's coercive system of government. They know very little of the temper and feelings of men, especially of Irishmen, who suppose that the mere danger of losing life will compel them to look quietly on, while their friends are suffering, and they themselves are in the daily danger of suffering, all the evils of a needless and relentless persecution. The persecutors may, it is true, by an overwhelming military power, enforce an occasional and temporary submission; but human fears commonly yield to resentment and exasperation; and, although disunion, or want of warlike means, may deprive the persecuted of all hopes of success, their very despair, which will be thus excited, may become dreadful, perhaps fatal, to their adversaries. But to proceed with our story. On the day following the occurrences related in the last chapter, Ellen's favourite and faithful friend, Miss Agnew, arrived at the castle. Ellen had sent for this young lady shortly after consenting that her father should name the wedding-day, in order that she, who had shared so sensibly in her afflictions, should now have an opportunity of sharing in her joys. Into her bosom she poured all her feelings, her hopes, her joys, her wishes, her anxieties, the intensity of her love and admiration for the generous youth who had done so much for her, who already possessed her heart, and into whose keeping she, with so much fondness and delight, was so soon to commit her destiny. Then, with a species of transient fear, she would revert to the awful change that was about to take place in her situation, and the high responsibility as a wife, as a peeress, and, perhaps, as a mother, she was about to incur. Then reflecting on her removal from the scenes, and the friends of her youth, she would say: “And when I am married, I must also reside at a distance from these haunts, so endeared to me by a thousand recollections; and from my youthful friends; and from thee too, Maria, the earliest and best beloved of them all, I must separate. But,” she would add, “without my Edward, the enjoyment of friends, country, and every thing else I have hitherto prized, could not make me happy. Ah! I feel that the possession of such a husband is Vol. II. u worth every sacrifice. Oh, Maria! rejoice with your friend, for I am indeed happy! Heaven, in giving me him, gives me the highest boon earth can afford.” Miss Agnew would often rally her on these bursts of love and joy, but with such visible satisfaction in her looks, as showed that in her heart she rejoiced in her friend's happiness, and consequently contributed to increase it. It is not to be supposed that in these confidential conversations, the gallant, gay Charles Martin was altogether forgotten. Miss Agnew delighted to talk of him. “I confess I love him,” she would say. “He is so sweet in his looks, so tender in his manner, that, during the day, I can scarcely ever withdraw my thoughts from him; and, during the night, I can do nothing but dream of him. But I hope I shall yet get the better of such folly. He wrote to my father lately, requesting permission to visit me, and the old man was silly enough to ask my opinion on the subject. I told him to act as he thought proper, for I would not have him, on my account, to forbid the coming of any respectable person to our house.” “We expect him here every day,” said Ellen. “Lord Barrymore has written him an invitation to attend our marriage. I wish we could have a double wedding. What say you, Maria?” “Hush!” cried Maria. “One uproar of the kind is enough at one time.” Thus passed several days, which, to our heroine, flew on the wings of love and friendship, when her father arrived, accompanied with Sir Philip Martin and his son Charles. It would be wrong to stop at present to describe the joyful welcome they received at the Castle, for the reader must be impatient to come to the grand conclusion of the whole affair, the making our hero and heroine husband and wife. The important day arrived sometime in the middle of November. The wedding garments were prepared, the wedding guests were invited, and the wedding feast was provided.—But hold! we must have no formal descriptions of such trifles.—They are unfashionable, and in these days, any thing unfashionable, is as intolerable in a novel as in a drawing room. But it ought to be known that, on this occasion, O'Halloran regulated the proceedings according to his own fancy, which was somewhat old fashioned. He accordingly managed it so that the whole scene was almost a repetition of what took place when he himself was married to Ellen's grandmother. The party consisted of about twenty four persons, comprising a tolerably well proportioned assortment of males and females. Among the former, as a most essential personage on the occasion, was the Rev. Mr. Nichols, who was O'Halloran's spiritual teacher, and with whose character the reader has already had some acquaintance. At about five in the afternoon the company sat down to a very comfortable dinner, after partaking of which, at the usual time, the ladies withdrew, and the gentlemen remained behind, perhaps so long that each had a reasonable time to drink two glasses of port, and one goblet of Jamaica rum punch. Some them betook themselves to backgammon, some to the library, and some to the ladies for amusement. “Why, this was only an ordinary dinner! What appearance of a wedding is there in all this?” Have patience, dear reader, we are not yet come to the wedding. But I trust we soon shall, although O'Halloran must have his own old jog-trot way. Great people do things of this kind far more dashingly now-a-days—that is, when their fathers and mothers, or guardians happen to give their consent. They roll to church and back again, with a long splendid train of carriages behind them, driving with as much velocity as if they had lost their senses, or were running for a wager, causing the streets and highways to tremble, and the gaping multitude to stare with astonishment, as they pass along. But O'Halloran was none of those dashing people; and as to Lord Barrymore, provided the knot was made firm and legal, he cared not how small a degree of pomp and pageantry attended the tying of it. He wanted his Ellen to be his wife, and if the forms that made her so, were agreeable to both divine and human laws, the mere embellishing accompaniments were to him matters of indifference. But let us “haste to the wedding.” At about seven o'clock the whole party assembled to tea in the usual sitting room. The task of presiding at this repast was assigned to Miss Agnew, as Ellen's thoughts were supposed to be too much occupied with more important concerns, to undertake it. She sat at Miss Agnew's right hand. Her lover sat beside her; and attended to all her wants with punctilious delicacy and solicitude. Ah! is there a youth in Christendom, who would not have envied his situation? After the tea table was removed, and the company promiscuously seated around the room, while all, except the lovers who engrossed in mutual fondness sat beside each other on a sofa, were engaged in a lively desultory conversation, O'Halloran whispered something to Sir Francis, who immediately rising, advanced to his daughter. The clergymen perceiving what was intended, rose also, and standing behind a large arm chair on which he had been sitting, pronounced the words, “let us proceed.”—At once, the whole company stood up. Sir Francis then led his blushing daughter, accompanied by her lover, forward, saying, “I here bestow you, my Ellen, to a man, whom I think, in every respect, worthy of such a gift. Receive her, my lord, and may God bless you both!” With a graceful bow, and an exulting heart, the young lord received possession of the long-loved maid thus presented to him; and the two stood before the clergyman. That holy man then proceeded with the ceremony according to the form observed by the reverend ministers of the Synod of Ulster, being nearly the same as that prescribed by the church of Scotland. After some appropriate observations on the nature and design of the institution of marriage, and the duties and obligations which it imposes on the parties who engage in it, he administered to our lovers those solemn vows, whose miraculous power can form two into one; and having declared them to be husband and wife, he addressed heaven in a short prayer suited to the occasion, and concluded by desiring Lord Barrymore to embrace his wife. “My wife! O blessed sound!” thought the young bridegroom, as, with an enraptured heart, he imprinted the ardent embrace on her glowing lips. After spending a reasonable time in courtship, Charles Martin followed the example of his friend Barrymore, and, in due form, exchanged matrimonial vows with the sprightly and laughter-loving Miss Agnew. It is unnecessary to pursue the history of these personages further. It may be mentioned, however, that the Insurgent Chief, lived to see several of his great grand-children; and then calmly withdrew to his fathers, leaving behind him a memory which will be long honoured by the warm-hearted people of the romantic country, for whose independence he had, in vain, contended so bravely, and suffered so much.
