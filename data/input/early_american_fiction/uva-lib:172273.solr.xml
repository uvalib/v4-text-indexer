      <field name="fulltext">14 THE VALLEY OF THE LOIRE. Je ne conçois qu'une manière de voyager plus agréable que d'aller à cheval; c'est d'aller à pied. On part à son moment, on s'arrête à sa volonté, on fait tant et si pen d'exercise qu'on veut. Quand on ne veut qu'arriver, on peut courir en chaise de poste; mais quand on veut voyager, il fant aller à pied. Rousseau. THE VALLEY OF THE LOIRE. Beside the murmuring Loire, Where shading elms along the margin grew, And freshened from the wave the zephyr flew. Goldsmith. In the melancholy month of October I made a foot-excursion along the banks of the Loire, from Orleans to Tours. This luxuriant region is justly called the Garden of France. From Orleans to Blois the whole valley of the Loire is one continued vineyard. The bright green foliage of the vine spreads, like the undulations of the sea, over all the landscape; with here and there a silver flash of the river,— a sequestered hamlet,—or the towers of an old chateau, to enliven and variegate the scene. The vintage had already commenced. The peasantry were busy in the fields,—the song that cheered their labor was on the breeze, and the heavy wagon tottered by, laden with the clusters of the vine. Every thing around me wore that happy look, which makes the heart glad. In the morning I arose with the lark; and at night I slept where sunset overtook me. The healthy exercise of foot-travelling,—the pure, bracing air of Autumn, and the cheerful aspect of the whole landscape about me, gave fresh elasticity to a mind not over-burdened with care, and made me forget, not only the fatigue of walking, but also the consciousness of being alone. My first day's journey brought me at evening to a village, whose name I have forgotten, situated about eight leagues from Orleans. It is a small, obscure hamlet, not mentioned in the guide-book, and stands upon the precipitous banks of a deep ravine, through which a noisy brook leaps down to turn the ponderous wheel of a thatch-roofed mill. The village inn stands upon the high-way; but the village itself is not visible to the traveller as he passes. It is completely hidden in the lap of a wooded valley; and so embowered in trees, that not a roof nor a chimney peeps out to betray its hiding place. It is like the nest of a ground-swallow, which the passing footstep almost treads upon, and yet it is not seen. I passed by without suspecting, that a village was near; and the little inn had a look so uninviting, that I did not even enter it. After proceeding a mile or two farther, I perceived, upon my left, a village spire, rising over the vineyards. Towards this I directed my footsteps; but it seemed to recede as I advanced, and at last quite disappeared. It was evidently many miles distant; and as the path I followed descended from the highway, it had gradually sunk beneath a swell of the vine-clad landscape. I now found myself in the midst of an extensive vineyard. It was just sunset; and the last golden rays lingered on the rich and mellow scenery around me. The peasantry were still busy at their task; and the occasional bark of a dog, and the distant sound of an evening bell gave fresh romance to the scene. The reality of many a day-dream of childhood,—of many a poetic revery of youth was before me. I stood at sunset amid the luxuriant vineyards of France! The first person I met was a poor old woman, a little bowed down with age, gathering grapes into a large basket. She was dressed like the poorest class of peasantry; and pursued her solitary task alone, heedless of the cheerful gossip, and the merry laugh, which came from a band of more youthful vintagers, at a short distance from her. She was so intently engaged in her work, that she did not perceive my approach, until I bade her good evening. On hearing my voice, she looked up from her labor, and returned the salutation: and on my asking her if there were a tavern, or a farm-house in the neighborhood, where I could pass the night, she showed me the pathway through the vineyard, that led to the village, and then added, with a look of curiosity; “You must be a stranger, Sir, in these parts.” “Yes; my home is very far from here.” “How far?” “More than a thousand leagues.” The old woman looked incredulous. “I came from a distant land, beyond the sea.” “More than a thousand leagues!” at length repeated she; “And why have you come so far from home?” “To travel;—to see how you live in this country.” “Have you no relations in your own?” “Yes; I have both brothers and sisters; a father, and—” “And a mother?” “Thank heaven, I have.” “And did you leave her!” Here the old woman gave me a piercing look of reproof; shook her head mournfully, and, with a deep sigh, as if some painful recollection had been awakened in her bosom, turned again to her solitary task. I felt rebuked; for there is something almost prophetic in the admonitions of the old. The eye of age looks meekly into my heart! the voice of age echoes mournfully through it! the hoary head and palsied hand of age plead irresistibly for its sympathies! I venerate old age; and I love not the man, who can look without emotion upon the sundown of life, when the dusk of evening begins to gather over the watery eye, and the shadows of twilight grow broader and deeper upon the understanding! I pursued the path-way which led toward the village, and the next person I encountered was an old man stretched lazily beneath the vines upon a little strip of turf, at a point where four paths met, forming a cross-way in the vineyard. He was clad in a coarse garb of gray, with a pair of long gaiters or spatter-dashes. Beside him lay a blue cloth cap, a staff, and an old weather-beaten knapsack. I saw at once, that he was a foot-traveller like myself, and, therefore, without more ado, entered into conversation with him. From his language, and the peculiar manner in which he now and then wiped his upper lip with the back of his hand, as if in search of the mustache, which was no longer there, I judged that he had been a soldier. In this opinion I was not mistaken. He had served under Napoleon, and had followed the imperial eagle across the Alps, and the Pyrenees, and the burning sands 15 of Egypt. Like every vieux moustache, he spake with enthusiasm of the Little Corporal, and cursed the English, the Germans, the Spanish, and every other race on earth, except the great nation—his own. “I like,” said he, “after a long day's march, to lie down in this way upon the grass, and enjoy the cool of the evening. It reminds me of the bivouacs of other days, and of old friends, who are now up there.” Here he pointed with his finger to the sky. “They have reached the last étape before me, in the long march. But I shall go soon. We shall all meet again at the last roll-call. A soldier has a heart,—and can feel like other men. Sacré nom de—! There's a tear!” He wiped it away with his sleeve. Here our colloquy was interrupted by the approach of a group of vintagers, who were returning homeward from their labor. To this party I joined myself, and invited the old soldier to do the same; but he shook his head. “I thank you; my path-way lies in a different direction.” “But there is no other village near, and the sun has already set.” “No matter. I am used to sleeping on the ground. Good night.” I left the old man to his meditations, and walked on in company with the vintagers. Following a well-trodden path-way through the vineyards, we soon descended the valley's slope, and I suddenly found myself in the bosom of one of those little hamlets, from which the laborer rises to his toil, as the sky-lark to his song. My companions wished me a good night, as each entered his own thatch-roofed cottage,— and a little girl led me out to the very inn, which an hour or two before, I had disdained to enter. When I awoke in the morning, a brilliant Autumnal sun was shining in at my window. The merry song of birds mingled sweetly with the sound of rustling leaves, and the gurgle of the brook. The vintagers were going forth to their toil; the wine-press was busy in the shade, and the clatter of the mill kept time to the miller's song. I loitered about the village with a feeling of calm delight. I was unwilling to leave the seclusion of this sequestered hamlet;—but at length, with reluctant step, I took the cross-road through the vineyard, and in a moment the little village had sunk again, as if by enchantment, into the bosom of the earth. I breakfasted at the town of Mer; and leaving the high-road to Blois on the right, passed down to the banks of the Loire, through a long, broad avenue of poplars and sicamores. I crossed the river in a boat, and in the after part of the day, found myself before the high and massive walls of the chateau of Chambord. This chateau is one of the finest specimens of the ancient Gothic castle to be found in Europe. The little river Cosson fills its deep and ample moat, and above it, the huge towers and heavy battlements rise in stern and solemn grandeur, moss-grown with age, and blackened by the storms of three centuries. Within, all is mournful and deserted. The grass has overgrown the pavement of the court-yard,—and the rude sculpture upon the walls is broken and defaced. From the court-yard I entered the central tower, and ascending the principal stair-case, went out upon the battlements. I seemed to have stepped back into the precincts of the feudal ages; and as I passed along through echoing corridors, and vast, deserted halls, stripped of their furniture, and mouldering silently away, the distant past came back upon me, and the times when the clang of arms, and the tramp of mail-clad men, and the sounds of music, and revelry and wassail echoed along those high-vaulted and solitary chambers! My third day's journey brought me to the ancient city of Blois, the chief town of the department of Loire-et-Cher. This city is celebrated for the purity with which even the lower classes of its inhabitants speak their native tongue. It rises precipitously from the northern bank of the Loire; and many of its streets are so steep as to be almost impassible for carriages. On the brow of the hill, overlooking the roofs of the city, and commanding a fine view of the Loire and its noble bridge, and the surrounding country, sprinkled with cottages and country-seats, runs an ample terrace, planted with trees, and laid out as a public walk. The view from this terrace is one of the most beautiful in France. But what most strikes the eye of the traveller at Blois is an old, though still unfinished chateau. Its huge parapets of hewn stone stand upon either side of the street; but they have walled up the wide gate-way, from which the colossal draw-bridge was to have sprung high in air, connecting together the main towers of the chateau, and the two hills, upon whose slope its foundations stand. The aspect of the vast pile is gloomy and desolate. It seems as if the strong hand of the builder had been arrested in the midst of his task by the stronger hand of death; and the unfinished fabric stands a lasting monument both of the power and weakness of man,—of his vast desires,—his sanguine hopes,—his ambitious purposes,—and of the unlooked-for conclusion, where all these desires, and hopes, and purposes are so often arrested.—There is also at Blois another ancient chateau, to which some historic interest is attached, as being the scene of the massacre of the Duke of Guise. On the following day I left Blois for Amboise, and after walking several leagues along the dusty highway, crossed the river in a boat to the little village of Moines, which lies amid luxuriant vineyards upon the southern bank of the Loire. From Moines to Amboise the road is truly delightful. The rich lowland scenery by the margin of the river is verdant even in October; and occasionally the landscape is diversified with the picturesque cottages of the vintagers, cut in the rock along the road-side, and overhung by the thick foliage of the vines above them. At Amboise I took a cross-road, which led me to the romantic borders of the Cher, and the chateau of Chernanceau. This beautiful chateau, as well as that of Chambord, was built by the gay and munificent Francis the First. One is a specimen of strong and massive architecture—a dwelling for a warrior;— but the other is of a lighter and more graceful construction, and was destined for those soft languishments of passion, with which the fascinating Diane de Poitiers had filled the bosom of that voluptuous monarch. The chateau of Chernanceau is built upon arches across the river Cher, whose waters are made to supply the deep moat at each extremity. There is a spacious court-yard in front, from which a draw-bridge conducts to the outer hall of the chateau. There the armor of Francis the First still hangs upon the wall:—his shield, and helm and lance as if the chivalrous but dissolute prince had just exchanged them for the silken robes of the drawing-room. From this hall a door opens into a long gallery, extending the whole length of the building across the Cher. The walls of the gallery are hung with the faded portraits of the long line of the descendants of Hugh Capet; and the windows looking up and down the stream, command a fine reach of pleasant river scenery. This is said to be the only chateau in France, in which the ancient furniture of its original age is preserved. In one part of the building, you are shown the bed-chamber of Diane de Poitiers, with its antique chairs covered with faded damask and embroidery, her bed, and a portrait of the royal favorite hanging over the mantel-piece. In another, you see the apartment of the infamous Catherine de Medici;—a venerable arm-chair, and an autograph letter of Henry the Fourth;—and in an old laboratory, among broken crucibles, and neckless retorts, and drums and trumpets, and skins of wild beasts, and other ancient lumber of various kinds, are to be seen the bed-posts of Francis the First!—Doubtless the naked walls and the vast, solitary chambers of an old and desolate chateau inspire a feeling of greater solemnity and awe; but when the antique furniture of the olden time remains—the faded tapestry on the walls—and the arm-chair by the fire-side, the effect upon the mind is more magical and delightful. The old inhabitants of the place, long gathered to their fathers, though living still in history, seem to have left their halls for the chace or the tournament; and as the heavy door swings upon its reluctant hinge, one almost expects to see the gallant princes and courtly dames enter those halls again, and sweep in stately procession along the silent corridors. Wrapt in such fancies as these, and gazing on the beauties of this noble chateau, and the soft scenery around it, I lingered unwilling to depart, till the rays of the setting sun, streaming through the dusty windows, admonished me that the day was drawing rapidly to a close. I sallied forth from the southern gate of the 16 chateau—and crossing the broken drawbridge, pursued a pathway along the bank of the river, still gazing back upon those towering walls, now bathed in the rich glow of sunset, till a turn in the road, and a clump of woodland at length shut them out from my sight. A short time after candle-lighting I reached the little tavern of the Boule d'Or, a few leagues from Tours, where I passed the night. The following morning was lowering and sad. A veil of mist hung over the landscape, and ever and anon a heavy shower burst from the over-burdened clouds, that were driving by before a high and piercing wind. This unpropitious state of the weather detained me until noon; when a cabriolet for Tours drove up, and taking a seat within it, I left the hostess of the Boule d'Or in the middle of a long story about a rich countess, who always alighted there when she passed that way. We drove leisurely along through a beautiful country, till at length we came to the brow of a steep hill, which commands a fine view of the city of Tours and its delightful environs. But the scene was shrouded by the heavy, drifting mist, through which, I could trace but indistinctly the graceful sweep of the Loire, and the spires and roofs of the city far below me. The city of Tours and the delicious plain in which it lies, have been too often described by other travellers, to render a new description from so listless a pen as mine, either necessary or desirable. After a sojourn of two cloudy and melancholy days, I set out on my return to Paris, by the way of Vendôme and Chartres. I stopped a few hours at the former place, to examine the ruins of a chateau, built by Jeanne d'Albret, mother of Henry the Fourth. It stands upon the summit of a high and precipitous hill, and almost overhangs the town beneath. The French Revolution has completed the ruin, that time had already begun; and nothing now remains but a broken and crumbling bastion, and here and there a solitary tower dropping slowly to decay. In one of these is the grave of Jeanne d'Albret. A marble entablature in the wall above contains the inscription, which is nearly effaced, though enough still remains to tell the curious traveller, that there lies buried the mother of the “Bon Henri.” To this is added a prayer, that the repose of the dead may be respected; —a prayer, which has been shamefully disregarded. Here ended my foot-excursion. The object of my journey was accomplished, and delighted with this short ramble through the Valley of the Loire, I took my seat in the Diligence for Paris, and, on the following day, was again swallowed up in the crowds of the metropolis, like a drop in the bosom of the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ANCIENT LYRIC POETRY OF THE NORTH OF FRANCE. Quant recommence et revient biaux estez, Que foille et flor resplendit par boschage, Que li froiz tanz de l'hyver est passez, Et cil oisel chantent en lor langage, Lors chanterai Et envoisiez serai De cuer verai. Jaques de Chison. THE TROUVÈRES. Quant voi la glaie meure, Et le rosier espanir, Et sur la bele verdure La rousée resplendir, Lors soupir Pour cele que tant désir. Raoul de Soissons. The literature of France is peculiarly rich in poetry of the olden time. We can trace up the stream of song until it is lost in the deepening shadows of the Middle Ages. Even there it is not a shallow, tinkling rill; but it comes like a mountain stream, rushing and sounding onward through the enchanted regions of romance, and mingles its voice with the tramp of steeds and the brazen sound of arms. The glorious reign of Charlemagne 1 1. The following amusing description of this Restorer of Letters, as his biographers call him, is taken from the fabulous Chronicle of John Turpin, chap. xx. “The Emperor was of a ruddy complexion, with brown hair; of a well-made handsome form, but a stern visage. His height was about eight of his own feet, which were very long. He was of a strong robust make; his legs and thighs very stout, and his sinews firm. His face was thirteen inches long; his beard a palm; his nose half a palm; his forehead a foot over. His lion-like eyes flashed fire like carbuncles; his eye-brows were half a palm over. When he was angry, it was a terror to look upon him. He required eight spans for his girdle, besides what hung loose. He ate sparingly of bread; but a whole quarter of lamb, two fowls, a goose, or a large portion of pork; a peacock, crane, or a whole hare. He drank moderately of wine and water. He was so strong, that he could at a single blow cleave asunder an armed soldier on horseback from the head to the waist, and the horse likewise. He easily vaulted over four horses harnessed together; and could raise an armed man from the ground to his head, as he stood erect upon his hand.” at the close of the eighth and the commencement of the ninth century, seems to have breathed a spirit of literature as well as of chivalry throughout all France. The monarch established schools and academies in different parts of his realm; and took delight in the society and conversation of learned men. It is amusing to see with what evident self-satisfaction some of the magi, whom he gathered around 17 him, speak of their exertions in widening the sphere of human knowledge, and pouring in light upon the darkness of their age. “For some,” says Alcuin, the director of the school of St Martin de Tours, “I cause the honey of the holy scriptures to flow; I intoxicate others with the old wine of ancient history; these I nourish with the fruits of grammar, gathered by my own hands; and those I enlighten by pointing out to them the stars, like lamps attached by the vaulted ceiling of a great palace!” Beside this classic erudition of the schools, the age had also its popular literature. Those who were untaught in scholastic wisdom, were learned in traditionary lore; for they had their ballads, in which were described the valor and achievements of the early kings of the Franks. These ballads, of which a collection was made by order of Charlemagne, animated the rude soldier as he rushed to battle, and were sung in the midnight bivouacs of the camp. “Perhaps it is not too much to say” observes the literary historian Schlegel, “that we have still in our possession, if not the original language and form, at least the substance of many of those ancient poems, which were collected by the orders of that prince;—I refer to the Nibelungen Lied, and the collection which goes by the name of the Heldenbuch.” When at length the old Tudesque language, which was the court language of Charlemagne, had given place to the Langue d'Oil, the Northern dialect of the French romance, these ancient ballads passed from the memories of the descendants of the Franks, and were succeeded by the romances of Charlemagne and his Twelve Peers,—of Roland, and Oliver, and the other Paladins, who died at Roncesvalles. Robert Wace, a Norman Trouvère of the twelfth century, says in one of his poems, that a minstrel named Taillefer, mounted on a swift horse, went in front of the Norman army at the battle of Hastings, singing these ancient poems. These chansons de geste, or old historic romances of France, are epic in their character, though without doubt they were written to be chaunted to the sound of an instrument. To what period many of them belong in their present form has never yet been fully determined; and should it finally be proved by phylological research, that they can claim no higher antiquity than the twelfth or thirteenth century, still there can be little doubt that in their original form many of them reached far back into the ninth or tenth. The long prevalent theory, that the romances of the Twelve Peers of France all originated in the fabulous chronicle of Charlemagne and Roland, written by the Archbishop Turpin in the twelfth century, if not as yet generally exploded, is nevertheless fast losing ground. To the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, also, belong most of the Fabliaux, or metrical tales of the Trouvères. Many of these compositions are remarkable for the inventive talent they display; but as poems they have, generally speaking, little merit, and at times exhibit such a want of refinement, such open and gross obscenity as to be highly offensive. It is a remarkable circumstance in the literary history of France, that whilst her anti-quarians and scholars have devoted themselves to collecting and illustrating the poetry of the Troubadours, the early lyric poets of the South, that of the Trouvères, or Troubadours of the North, has been almost entirely neglected. By a singular fatality, too, what little time and attention have hitherto been bestowed upon the fathers of French poetry, have been so directed as to save from oblivion little of the most valuable portions of their writings, whilst the more tedious and worthless parts have been brought forth to the public eye, as if to deaden curiosity and put an end to farther research. The ancient historic romances of the land have, for the most part, been left to slumber on unnoticed; whilst the obscene and tiresome Fabliaux have been ushered in to the world as fair specimens of the ancient poetry of France. This has created unjust prejudices in the minds of many against the literature of the olden time, and has led them to regard it as nothing more than a confused mass of coarse and vulgar fictions, adapted to a rude and inelegant state of society. Of late, however, a more discerning judgment has been brought to the difficult task of ancient research; and in consequence of this the long established prejudices against the crumbling monuments of the national literature of France during the Middle Ages is fast disappearing. Several learned men are engaged in rescuing from oblivion the ancient poetic romances of Charlemagne and the Twelve Peers of France, and their labors seem destined to throw new light not only upon the state of literature, but upon the state of society, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Among the voluminous remains of Troubadour literature, little else has yet been discovered save poems of a lyric character. The lyre of the Troubodour seems to have responded to the impulse of momentary feelings only,—to the touch of local and transitory circumstances. His song was a sudden burst of excited feeling:—it ceased when the passion was subdued, or rather when its first feverish excitement passed away; and as the liveliest feelings are the most transitory, the songs, which embodied them are short, but full of spirit and energy. On the other hand the great mass of the poetry of the Trouvères is of a narrative or epic character. The genius of the North seems always to have delighted in romantic fiction; and whether we attribute the origin of modern romance to the Arabians or to the Scandanavians,— this at least is certain, that there existed marvellous tales in the nothern languages, and from these, in part at least, the Trouvères imbibed the spirit of narrative poetry. There are no traces of lyric compositions among their writings, till about the commencement of the thirteenth century; and it seems probable that the spirit of song-writing was imbibed from the Troubadours of the South. Unfortunately the neglect which has so long attended the old historic and heroic romances of the North of France has also befallen in some degree its early lyric poetry. Little has yet been done to discover and bring forth its riches; and doubtless many a sweet little ballad and melancholly complaint lies buried in the dust of the thirteenth century. It is not however my object, in this paper to give an historical sketch of this ancient and almost forgotten poetry, but simply to bring forward a few specimens, which shall exhibit its most striking and obvious characteristics. In these examples it would be in vain to look for high-wrought expression, suited to the prevailing taste of the present day. Their most striking peculiarity, and perhaps their greatest merit, consists in the simple and direct expression of feeling, which they contain. This feeling, too, is one which breathes the langor of that submissive homage, which was paid to beauty in the days of chivalry; and I am aware that in this age of masculine and matter-of-fact thinking, the love-conceits of a more poetic state of society are generally looked upon as extremely trivial and puerile. Nevertheless I shall venture to present one or two of these simple ballads, which by recalling the distant age wherein they were composed, may peradventure please by the power of contrast. I have just remarked, that one of the greatest beauties of these ancient ditties is naïveté of thought and simplicity of expression. These I shall endeavor to preserve as far as possible in the translation, though I am fully conscious how much the sparkling beauty of an original loses in being filtered through the idioms of a foreign language. The favorite theme of the ancient lyric poets of the North of France is the wayward passion of love. They all delight to sing les douces dolors et li mal plaisant de fine amor. With such feelings the beauties of the opening Spring are naturally associated. Almost every love ditty of the old poets commences with some such exordium as this; “When the snows of winter have passed away, when the soft and gentle spring returns, and the flower and leaf shoot in the groves, and the little birds warble to their mates in their own sweet language,—then will I sing my lady-love! Another favourite introduction to these little rhapsodies of romantic passion, is the approach of morning and its sweet-voiced herald, the lark. The minstrel's song to his lady-love frequently commences with an allusion to the hour, `When the rose-bud opes its e'en, And the blue-bells droop and die, And upon the leaves so green Sparkling dew-drops lie.' The following is at once the simplest and prettiest piece of this kind which I have met 18 with among the early lyric poets of the North of France. It is taken from an anonymous poem entitled “The Paradise of Love.” A lover having passed the “live-long night in tears, as he was wont,” goes forth to beguile his sorrows with the fragrance and beauty of morning. The carol of the vaulting sky-lark salutes his ear, and to this merry musician he makes his complaint. He! aloete, Joliete! Petit t'est de mes maus. Hark! hark! Pretty lark! Little heedest thou my pain! But if to these longing arms Pitying Love would yield the charms Of the fair With smiling air, Blithe would beat my heart again. Hark! hark! Pretty lark! Little heedest thou my pain! Love may force me still to bear While he lists, consuming care, But in anguish Though I languish, Faithful shall my heart remain. Hark! hark! Pretty lark! Little heedest thou my pain! Then cease, Love, to torment me so;— But rather than all thoughts forego Of the fair With flaxen hair, Give me back her frowns again. Hark! hark! Pretty lark! Little heedest thou my pain!— Beside the “woful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow,” the early lyric poet frequently indulges in more calmly analyzing the philosophy of love, or in questioning the object and destination of a sigh. Occasionally these quaint conceits are prettily expressed, and the little song flutters through the page like a butterfly. The following is an example. Et on vas tu, petit soupir, Que j'ai oui si doulcement? And whither goest thou gentle sigh, Breathed so softly in my ear? Say; dost thou bear his fate severe To Love's poor martyr doomed to die? Come; tall me quickly,—do not lie, What secret message bringest thou here?— And whither goest thou, gentle sigh, Breathed so softly in my ear?— May heaven conduct thee to thy will, And safely speed thee on thy way; This only I would humbly pray— Pierce deep—but, oh! forbear to kill. And whither goest thou, gentle sigh, Breathed so softly in my ear? The ancient lyric poets of France are generally spoken of as a class, and their beauties and defects referred to them collectively and not individually. In truth there are few characteristic marks by which any individual author can be singled out and ranked above the rest. The lyric poets of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries stand upon nearly the same level. But in the fifteenth century there were two, who surpassed all their contemporaries in the beauty and delicacy of their sentiments; and in the sweetness of their diction, and the structure of their verse, stand far in advance of the age in which they lived. These are Charles d'Orléans and Clotilde de Surville. Charles, Duke of Orleans, the father of Louis the Twelfth, and uncle of Francis the First, was born in 1391. In the general tenor of his life, the peculiar character of his mind, and his talent for poetry, there is a striking resemblance between this noble poet and James the First of Scotland, his contemporary. Both were remarkable for learning and refinement; —both passed a great portion of their lives in sorrow and imprisonment; and both cheered the solitude of their prison walls with the charms of poetry. Charles d' Orléans was taken prisoner at the battle of Agincourt in 1415, and carried into England, where he remained twenty five years in captivity. It was there, that he composed the greater part of his poetry. In 1440 he returned to France, where he died in 1467. The poems of this writer exhibit a singular delicacy of thought and sweetness of expression. The following little Renouveaux, or songs on the return of Spring, are full of delicacy and beauty. Le temps a laissé son manteau De vent, de froidure et de pluye. Now Time throws off his cloak again Of ermin'd frost, and wind and rain, And clothes him in the embroidery Of glittering sun and clear blue sky. With beast and bird the forest rings, Each in his jargon cries or sings: And Time throws off his cloak again Of ermin'd frost, and wind and rain. River, and fount, and tinkling brook Wear in their dainty livery Drops of silver jewelry; In new made suit they merry look; And Time throws off his cloak again Of ermin'd frost, and wind and rain. The second upon the same subject presents a still more agreeable picture of the departure of Winter and the sweet return of Spring. Bien monstrez, printemps gracieux, De quel mestier savez servir. Gentle Spring!—in sunshine clad, Well dost thou thy power display! For Winter maketh the light heart sad, And thou,—thou makest the sad heart gay. He sees thee—and calls to his gloomy train, The sleet, and the snow, and the wind, and the rain; And they shrink away—and they flee in fear, When thy merry step draws near. Winter giveth the fields and the trees so old, Their beards of icicles and snow;— And the rain, it raineth so fast and cold, We must cower over the embers low; And snugly housed from the wind and weather, Mope like birds that are changing feather. But the storm retires, and the sky grows clear, When thy merry step draws near. Winter maketh the sun in the gloomy sky, Wrap him round in a mantle of cloud; But, Heaven be praised, thy step is nigh; Thou tearest away the mournful shroud, And the earth looks bright—and Winter surly Who has toiled for naught both late and early, Is banished afar by the new-born year, When thy merry step draws near. The only person of that age who can dispute the laurel with Charles d' Orléans is Clotilde de Surville. This sweet poetess was born in the Bas-Vivarais in the year 1405. Her style is singularly elegant and correct, and the reader who will take the trouble to decipher her rude provincial orthography, will find her writings full of quiet beauty. The following sweet lines, which breathe the very soul of maternal tenderness, are part of a little poem to her first born. O cher enfantelet, vray pourtraict de ton pere! Dors sur le seyn que ta bousche a pressé. Sweet babe! true portrait of thy father's face, Sleep on the bosom that thy lips have prest! Sleep, little one; and closely, gently place Thy drowsy eyelid on thy mother's breast. Upon that tender eye, my little friend, Soft sleep shall come, that cometh not to me! I watch to see thee, nourish thee, defend— Tis sweet to watch for thee—alone for thee. His arms fall down; sleep sits upon his brow; His eye is closed; he sleeps—how still and calm! Wore not his cheek the apple's ruddy glow, Would you not say he slept on death's cold arm? Awake, my boy!—I tremble with affright! Awake, and chase this fatal thought!—unclose Thine eye but for one moment on the light! Even at the price of thine give me repose! Sweet error!—he but slept—I breathe again— Come gentle dreams, the hour of sleep beguile! Oh! when shall he for whom I sigh in vain, Beside me watch to see thy waking smile? But upon this theme I have written enough,—perhaps too much. `This may be poetry for ought I know, Says an old worthy friend of mine, while leaning Over my shoulder as I write, although I can't exactly comprehend its meaning.' I have touched upon the subject before me in a brief and desultory manner, and have purposely left my remarks unincumbered by learned reference and far-sought erudition; for these are ornaments which would ill become so trivial a pen as this wherewith I write, though perchance the want of them will render my essay unsatisfactory to the scholar and the critic. But I am emboldened thus to skim with a light wing over this poetic lore of the past, by the reflection that the greater part of my readers belong not to that grave and serious class, who love the deep wisdom, which lies in quoting from a quaint, forgotten tome, and are ready on all occasions to say, “Commend me to the owl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">19 THE BAPTISM OF FIRE. A LEAF FROM HISTORY. It is a maxim among us Christians, that we cannot possibly suffer any real hurt, if we cannot be convicted of doing any real evil. You may kill, indeed, but you cannot hurt us. JUSTIN MARTYR. THE BAPTISM OF FIRE. The more you mow us down, the thicker we rise; the Christian blood you spill is like the seed you sow;—it springs from the earth again and fructifies the more. TERTULLIAN. As day was drawing to a close, and the rays of the setting sun climbed slowly up the dungeon wall, the prisoner sat and read in a tome with silver clasps. He was a man in the vigor of his days, with a pale and noble countenance, that wore less the marks of worldly care than of high and holy thought. His temples were already bald; but a thick and curling beard bespoke the strength of manhood, and his eye, dark, full, and eloquent, beamed with all the enthusiasm of a martyr. The book before him was a volume of the early Christian Fathers. He was reading the Apologetic of the eloquent Tertullian, the oldest and ablest writer of the Latin Church. At times he paused, and raised his eyes to heaven as if in prayer, and then read on again in silence. At length a passage seemed to touch his inmost soul. He read aloud; “Give us, then, what names you please, from the instruments of cruelty you torture us by, call us Sarmenticians and Semaxians, because you fasten us to trunks of trees, and stick us about with faggots to set us on fire; yet let me tell you, when we are thus begirt and dressed about with fire, we are then in our most illustrious apparel. These are our victorious palms and robes of glory; and mounted on our funeral pile we look upon ourselves in our triumphal chariot. No wonder, then, such passive heroes please not those they vanquish with such conquering sufferings. And therefore we pass for men of despair, and violently bent upon our own destruction. However, that which you are pleased to call madness and despair in us, are the very actions, which under virtue's standard lift up your sons of fame and glory, and emblazon them to future ages.” He arose and paced the dungeon to and fro, with folded arms and a firm step. His thoughts held communion with eternity. “Father, which art in Heaven!” he exclaimed; “give me strength to die, like those holy men of old, who scorned to purchase life at the expense of truth. That truth has made me free; and though condemned on earth, I know that I am absolved in heaven!” He again seated himself at his table, and read in that tome with silver clasps. This solitary prisoner was Anne Du Bourg, a man, who feared not man. Once a merciful judge in that august tribunal, upon whose voice hung the life and death of those, who were persecuted for conscience' sake, he was now himself an accused,—a convicted heretic, condemned to the baptism of fire, because he would not unrighteously condemn others. He had dared to plead the cause of suffering humanity before that dread tribunal, and in the presence of the king himself to declare, that it was an offence to the majesty of God to shed man's blood in his name. Six weary months, —from June to December,—he had lain a prisoner in that dungeon, from which a death by fire was soon to set him free. Such was the clemency of Henry the Second! As the prisoner read, his eyes were filled with tears. He still gazed upon the printed page, but it was a blank before his eyes. His thoughts were far away amid the scenes of his childhood, amid the green valleys of Riom, and the Golden Mountains of Auvergne. Some simple word had called up the vision of the past. He was a child again. He was playing with the pebbles of the brook,—he was shouting to the echo of the hills,—he was praying at his mother's knee, with his little hands clasped in hers. This dream of childhood was broken by the grating of bolts and bars, as the jailor opened his prison door. A moment afterwards, his former colleague De Harley stood at his side. “Thou here!” exclaimed the prisoner, surprised at the visit. “Thou in the dungeon of an heretic! On what errand hast thou come?” “On an errand of mercy,” replied De Harley. “I come to tell thee—” “That the hour of my death draws near?” “That thou mayst still be saved.” “Yes; if I will bear false witness against my God—barter heaven for earth—an eternity for a few brief days of worldly existence. Lost, thou shouldst say,—lost, not saved!” “No! saved!” cried De Harley with warmth; “saved from a death of shame and an eternity of wo! Renounce this false doctrine—this abominable heresy—and return again to the bosom of the church, which thou dost rend with strife and dissention.” “God judge between thee and me, which has embraced the truth.” “His hand already smites thee.” “It has fallen more heavily upon those who so unjustly persecute me. Where is the king? —he who said, that with his own eyes he would behold me perish at the stake?—he, to whom the undaunted Du Faur cried, like Elijah to Ahab, It is thou, who troublest Israel! Where is the king?—called through a sudden and violent death to the judgment-seat of heaven!—Where is Minard, the persecutor of the just?—Slain by the hand of an assassin! It was not without reason, that I said to him, when standing before my accusers, Tremble! believe the word of one, who is about to appear before God; thou likewise shalt stand there soon,—thou, that sheddest the blood of the children of peace.—He has gone to his account before me.” “And that menace has hastened thine own condemnation. Minard was slain by the Huguenots, and it is whispered, that thou wert privy to his death.” “This at least might have been spared a dying man!” replied the prisoner, much agitated by so unjust and so unexpected an accusation. “As I hope for mercy hereafter, I am innocent of the blood of this man, and of all knowledge of so foul a crime. But tell me, hast thou come here only to embitter my last hours with such an accusation as this? If so, I pray thee, leave me. My moments are precious. I would be alone.” “I came to offer thee life, freedom, and happiness.” 20 “Life—freedom—happiness! At the price thou hast set upon them, I scorn them all! Had the apostles and martyrs of the early christian church listened to such paltry bribes as these, where were now the faith in which we trust! These holy men of old shall answer for me. Hear what Justin Martyr says in his earnest appeal to Antonine the Pious, in behalf of the christians, who in his day were unjustly loaded with public odium and oppression. He opened the volume before him and read. “I could wish you would take this also into consideration, that what we say is really for your own good; for it is in our power at any time to escape your torments, by denying the faith, when you question us about it; but we scorn to purchase life at the expense of a lie; for our souls are winged with a desire of a life of eternal duration and purity, of an immediate conversation with God the father and maker of all things. We are in haste to be confessing and finishing our faith; being fully persuaded, that we shall arrive at this blessed state, if we approve ourselves to God by our works, and, by our obedience, express our passion for that divine life, which is never interrupted by any clashing evil.” The Catholic and the Huguenot reasoned long and earnestly together; but they reasoned in vain. Each was firm in his belief; and they parted to meet no more on earth. On the following day Du Bourg was summoned before his judges to receive his final sentence. He heard it unmoved, and with a prayer to God, that he would pardon those who had condemned him according to their consciences. He then addressed his judges in an oration full of power and eloquence. It closed with these words. “And now, ye judges, if indeed you hold the sword of God as ministers of his wrath, to take vengeance upon those who do evil, beware, I charge you beware, how you condemn us. Consider well what evil we have done; and before all things, decide whether it be just, that we should listen unto you, rather than unto God. Are you so drunken with the wine-cup of the great sorceress, that you drink poison for nourishment? Are you not those, who make the people sin, by turning them away from the service of God? And if you regard more the opinion of men than that of heaven, in what esteem are you held by other nations and principalities and powers, for the martyrdoms you have caused in obedience to this blood-stained Phalaris?—God grant, thou cruel tyrant, that by thy miserable death, thou may'st put an end to our groans! Why weep ye? What means this delay? Your hearts are heavy within you. Your consciences are haunted by the judgment of God. And thus it is, that the condemned rejoice in the fires you have kindled, and think they never live better, than in the midst of consuming flames. Torments affright them not,—insults enfeeble them not,—their honor is redeemed by death—he that dies is the conqueror, and the conquered, he that mourns. No! whatever snares are spread for us, whatever suffering we endure, you cannot separate us from the love of Christ. Strike then —slay—grind us to powder! Those that die in the Lord shall live again; we shall all be raised together. Condemn me as you will—I am a christian; yes, I am a christian, and am ready to die for the glory of our Lord—for the truth of the evangelists. Quench, then, your fires! Let the wicked abandon his way, and return unto the Lord, and he will have compassion on him. Live— be happy—and meditate on God, ye Judges! As for me, I go rejoicing to my death. What wait ye for? Lead me to the scaffold!” They bound the prisoner's hands, and leading him forth from the council-chamber, placed him upon the cart, that was to bear him to the Place de Grève. Before and behind marched a guard of five hundred soldiers; for Du Bourg was beloved by the people, and a popular tumult was apprehended. The day was overcast and sad; and ever and anon the sound of the tolling bell mingled its dismal clang with the solemn notes of the funeral march. They soon reached the place of execution, which was already filled with a dense and silent crowd. In the centre stood the gallows with a pile of faggots beneath it, and the hangman, with a burning torch in his hand. But this funeral apparel inspired no terror in the heart of Du Bourg. A look of triumph beamed from his eye, and his countenance shone like that of an angel. With his own hands he divested himself of his outer garments, and gazing round upon the breathless and sympathizing crowd, exclaimed; “My friends; I come not hither as a thief or a murderer; but it is for the gospel's sake!” A cord was then fastened round his waist, and he was drawn up into the air. At the same moment the burning torch of the executioner was applied to the faggots beneath, and the thick volumes of smoke concealed the martyr from the horror-stricken crowd. One stifled groan arose from all that vast multitude, like the moan of the sea; and all was hushed again, save the crackling of the faggots, and at intervals the funeral knell, that smote the very soul. The quivering flames darted upward and around; and an agonizing cry broke from the murky cloud; “My God! My God! forsake me not, that I forsake not thee!” The wind lifted the reddening smoke, like a veil, and the form of the martyr was seen to fall into the fire beneath, that glowed like a furnace seven times heated. In a moment it rose again, its garments all in flame; and again the faint, half-smothered cry of agony was heard; “My God! my God! forsake me not, that I forsake not thee!” Once more the quivering body descended into the flames; and once more it was lifted into the air, a blackened, burning cinder. Again, and again this hellish mockery of baptism was repeated; till the martyr with a despairing, suffocating voice exclaimed; “O God! I cannot die!” The chief executioner came forward, and either in mercy to the dying man, or through fear of the populace, threw a noose over his neck, and strangled the almost lifeless victim. At the same moment, the cord which held the body was loosened, and it fell into the fire to rise no more. And thus was consummated the martyrdom of the Baptism of Fire.</field>

My brain methinks is like an hour-glass, Wherein my imaginations run like sands, Filling up time; but then are turn'd and turn'd So that I know not what to stay upon, And less to put in art. Ben Jonson. A rainy and gloomy winter was just drawing to its close, when I left Paris for the South of France. We started at sunrise; and as we passed along the solitary streets of the vast and silent metropolis, drowsily one by one its clanging horologes chimed the hour of six. Beyond the city gates the wide landscape was covered with a silvery net-work of frost; a wreath of vapor overhung the windings of the Seine; and every twig and shrub, with its sheath of crystal, flashed in the level rays of the rising sun. The sharp frosty air seemed to quicken the sluggish blood of the old postillion and his horses, a fresh team stood ready in harness at each stage, and notwithstanding the slippery pavement of the causeway, the long and tedious climbing the hill-side upwards, and the equally long and tedious descent with chained wheels and the drag,—just after night-fall the lumbering vehicle of Vincent Caillard stopped at the gateway of the Three Emperors in the famous city of Orleans. I cannot pride myself much upon being a good travelling companion, for the rocking of a coach always lulls me into forgetfulness of the present, and no sooner does the hollow monotonous rumbling of the wheels reach my ear, than like my friend Nick Bottom, “I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.” It is not, however, the deep, sonorous slumber of a laborer, “stuffed with distressful bread;” but a kind of day-dream, wherein the creations of fancy seem realities, and the real world, which swims dizzily before the half-shut, drowsy eye, becomes mingled with the imaginary world within. This is doubtless a very great failing in a traveller; and I confess with all humility, that at times the line of demarkation between truth and fiction is rendered thereby so indefinite and indistinct, that I cannot always determine with unerring certainty, whether an event really happened to me, or whether I only dreamed it. On this account I shall not attempt a detailed description of my journey from Paris to Bordeaux. I was travelling like a bird of passage; and five weary days and four weary nights I was on the way. The diligence stopped only to change horses, and for the travellers to take their meals; and by night I slept with my head under my wing in a snug corner of the coach. Strange as it may appear to some of my readers, this night-travelling is at times far from being disagreeable. Nay, if the country is flat and uninteresting, and you are favored with a moon, it may be very pleasant. As the night advances the conversation around you gradually dies away, and is imperceptibly given up to some garrulous traveller, who finds himself belated in the midst of a long story, and when at length he puts out his feelers in the form of a question, discovers by the silence around him, that the breathless attention of his audience is owing to their being asleep. All is now silent. You let down the window of the carriage, and the fresh night air cools your flushed and burning cheek. The landscape, though in reality dull and uninteresting, seems beautiful as it floats by in the soft moonshine. Every ruined hovel is changed by the magic of night to a trim cottage, every straggling and dilapidated hamlet becomes as beautiful as those we read of in poetry and romance. Over the lowland hangs a silver mist; over the hills peep the twinkling stars. The keen night air is a spur to the postillion and his horses. In the words of the old German ballad; `Halloo! halloo! away they go, Unheeding wet or dry, And horse and rider snort and blow, And sparkling pebbles fly. And all on which the moon doth shine Behind them flees afar, And backward sped, scuds overhead The sky and every star.' Anon you stop at the relay. The drowsy hostler crawls out of the stable yard; a few gruff words and strange oaths pass between him and the postillion,—then there is a coarse joke in patois, of which you understand the ribaldry only, and which is followed by a husky laugh, a sound between a hiss and a growl;—and then you are off again in a crack. Occasionally a way-traveller is uncaged, and a new-comer takes the vacant perch at your elbow. Meanwhile your busy fancy speculates upon all these things, and you fall asleep amid its thousand vagaries. Soon you wake again, and snuff the morning air. It was but a moment, and yet the night is gone. The gray of twilight steals into the window and gives a ghastly look to the countenances of the sleeping group around you. One sits bolt upright in a corner, offending none, and stiff and motionless as an Egyptian mummy; another sits equally straight and immovable, but snores like a priest; the head of a third is dangling over his shoulder, and the tassel of his nightcap tickles his neighbor's ear; a fourth has lost his hat,—his wig is awry, and his under lip hangs lolling about like an idiot's. The whole scene is a living caricature of man, presenting human nature in some of the grotesque attitudes she assumes, when that pragmatical school-master, propriety, has fallen asleep in his chair, and the unruly members of his charge are freed from the thraldom of the rod. On leaving Orleans, instead of following the great western mail-route through Tours, Poitiers, and Angoulême, and thence on to Bordeaux, I struck across the centre provinces of the Indre, the Haute-Vienne, and the Dordogne, passing through the provincial capitals of Châteauroux, Limoges, and Périgueux. South of the Loire the country assumes a more mountainous aspect, and the landscape is broken by long sweeping hills, and fertile valleys. Many a fair scene invites the traveller's foot to pause; and his eye roves with delight over the picturesque landscape of the valley of the Creuse, and the beautiful highland scenery near Périgueux. There are also many objects of art and antiquity, which arrest his attention. Argenton boasts its Roman amphitheatre, and the ruins of an old castle built by king Pepin; at Chalus the tower, beneath which Richard Cœur-de-Lion was slain, is still pointed out to the curious traveller, and Périgueux is full of crumbling monuments of the Middle Ages. Scenes like these, and the constant chatter of my fellow-travellers, served to enliven the tedium of a long and fatiguing journey. The French are preeminently a talking people; and every new object afforded a topic for light and animated discussion. The affairs of church and State were, however, the themes oftenest touched upon. The Law Project for the suppression of the liberty of the press was then under discussion in the Chamber of Peers, and excited the most lively interest through the whole kingdom. Of course it was a subject not likely to be forgotten in the stage-coach. “Ah! mon Dieu!” said a brisk little man, with snow-white hair, and a blazing red face, at the same time drawing up his shoulders to a level with his ears, “The ministry are determined to carry their point at all events. They mean to break down the liberty of the press, cost what it will.” “If they succeed,” added the person who sat opposite, “we may thank the Jesuits for it. It is all their work. They rule the mind of our imbecile monarch, and it is their miserable policy to keep the people in darkness.” “No doubt of that,” rejoined the first speaker, “Why, no longer ago, than yesterday I read in the Figaro, that a printer had been prosecuted for publishing the moral lessons of the Evangelists without the miracles.” “Is it possible!” said I. “And are the people so stupid as thus patiently to offer their shoulders to the pack-saddle?” “Most certainly not!—We shall have another revolution.” “If history speaks true, you have had revolutions enough, during the last century or two, to satisfy the most mercurial nation on earth. You have hardly been quiet a moment since the day of the Baracades and the memorable war of the pots-de-chambre in the times of the Grand Condé.” “You are pleased to speak lightly of our revolutions, Sir,” rejoined the politician, growing warm. “You must, however, confess that each successive one has brought us nearer to our object. Old institutions, whose foundations lie deep in the prejudices of a great nation, are 22 not to be toppled down by the springing of a single mine. You must confess, too, that our national character is much improved since the days you speak of. The youth of the present century are not so frivolous as those of the last. They have no longer that unbounded levity and light-heartedness so generally ascribed to them. From this circumstance we have every thing to hope. Our revolutions, likewise, must necessarily change their character, and secure to us more solid advantages than heretofore.” “Luck makes pluck, as the Germans say. You go on bravely; but it gives me pain to see religion and the church so disregarded.” “Superstition and the church, you mean, Sir;” said the gray-headed man. “Why, Sir, the church is nothing now-a-days, but a tumble-down, dilapidated tower, for rooks, and daws, and such silly birds to build their nests in!” It was now very evident that I had unearthed a radical; and there is no knowing when his harangue would have ended had not his voice been drowned by the noise of the wheels, as we entered the paved street of the city of Limoges. A breakfast of boiled capon stuffed with truffles, and accompanied by a pâté de Périgueux, a dish well known to French gourmands, restored us all to good humor. While we were at breakfast a personage stalked into the room, whose strange appearance arrested my attention, and gave subject for future conversation to our party. He was a tall, thin figure, armed with a long whip, brass spurs, and black whiskers. He wore a bell-crowned varnished hat, a blue frock-coat with standing collar, a red waistcoat, a pair of yellow leather breeches, and boots, that reached to the knees. I at first took him for a postillion, or a private courier; but, upon inquiry, I found that he was only the son of a Notary Public, and that he dressed in this strange fashion —to please his own fancy. As soon as we were comfortably seated in the diligence, I made some remark on the singular costume of the personage, whom I had just seen at the tavern. “These things are so common with us,” said the politician, “that we hardly notice them.” “What you want in liberty of speech, then, you make up in liberty of dress.” “Yes; in this, at least, we are a free people.” “I had not been long in France, before I discovered, that a man may dress as he pleases, without being stared at. The most opposite styles of dress seem to be in vogue at the same moment. No strange garment, nor desperate hat excites either ridicule or surprise. French fashions are known and imitated all the world over.” “Very true indeed,” said a little man in goslin green. “We give fashions to all other nations.” “Fashions!” said the politician with a kind of growl, “Fashions!—Yes, Sir, and some of us are simple enough to boast of it, as if we were a nation of tailors.” Here the little man in goslin green pulled up the horns of his cotton dicky. “I recollect,” said I, “that your Madame de Pompadour in one of her letters says something to this effect; We furnish our enemies with hair-dressers, ribbons and fashions; and they furnish us with laws.” “That is not the only silly thing she said in her life time. Ah! Sir, these Pompadours, and Maintenons, and Montespans were the authors of much woe to France. Their follies and extravagancies exhausted the public treasury, and made the nation poor. They built palaces, and covered themselves with jewels, and ate from golden plate, whilst the people who toiled for them, had hardly a crust to keep their own children from starvation! And yet they preach to us the divine right of Kings!” My radical had got upon his high horse again; and I know not whither it would have carried him, had not a thin man with a black, seedy coat, who sat at his elbow, at that moment crossed his path, by one of those abrupt and sudden transitions, which leave you aghast at the strange association of ideas in the speaker's mind. “Apropos de bottes!” exclaimed he. “Speaking of boots, and Notaries Public, and such matters,—excuse me for interrupting you, Sir—a little story has just popped into my head which may amuse the company; and as I am not very fond of political discussions,—no offence, Sir,—I will tell it, for the sake of changing the conversation.” Whereupon, without farther preamble or apology, he proceeded to tell his story in as nearly as may be the following words. You must know, Gentlemen, that there lived some years ago, in the city of Périgueux, an honest Notary Public, the descendant of a very ancient and broken-down family, and the occupant of one of those old, weather-beaten tenements, which remind you of the times of your great-grandfather. He was a man of an unoffending, sheepish disposition; the father of a family, though not the head of it; for in that family “the hen over-crowed the cock,” and the neighbors, when they spake of the Notary, shrugged their shoulders, and exclaimed, “Poor fellow! his spurs want sharpening.” In fine, you understand me, Gentlemen; he was a hen-pecked man. Well—finding no peace at home, he sought it elsewhere, as was very natural for him to do; and at length discovered a place of rest, far beyond the cares and clamors of domestic life. This was a little café estaminet, a short way out of the city, whither he repaired every evening, to smoke his pipe, drink sugar-water, and play his favorite game of domino. There he met the boon companions he most loved; heard all the floating chit-chat of the day; laughed when he was in merry mood; found consolation when he was sad; and at all times gave vent to his opinions without fear of being snubbed short by a flat contradiction. Now, the Notary's bosom friend, was a dealer in claret and cognac, who lived about a league from the city, and always passed his evenings at the estaminet. He was a gross corpulent fellow, raised from a full-blooded Gascon breed, and sired by a comic actor of some reputation in his way. He was remarkable for nothing but his good humor, his love of cards, and a strong propensity to test the quality of his own liquors by comparing them with those sold at other places. As evil communications corrupt good manners, the bad practices of the wine-dealer won insensibly upon the worthy Notary; and before he was aware of it, he found himself weaned from domino and sugar-water, and addicted to piquet and spiced wine. Indeed it not unfrequently happened, that after a long session at the estaminet, the two friends grew so urbane, that they would waste a full half-hour at the door in friendly dispute, which should conduct the other home. Though this course of life agreed well enough with the sluggish, phlegmatic temperament of the wine-dealer, it soon began to play the very deuce with the more sensitive organization of the Notary, and finally put his nervous system completely out of tune. He lost his appetite, became gaunt and haggard, and could get no sleep. Legions of blue-devils haunted him by day, and by night strange faces peeped through his bed curtains, and the night-mare snorted in his ear. The worse he grew, the more he smoked and tippled; and the more he smoked and tippled— why, as a matter of course, the worse he grew. His wife alternately stormed—remonstrated— entreated; but all in vain. She made the house too hot for him—he retreated to the tavern; she broke his long-stemmed pipes upon the andirons—he substituted a short-stemmed one, which, for safe keeping, he carried in his waistcoat pocket. Thus the unhappy Notary ran gradually down at the heel. What with his bad habits and his domestic grievances, he became completely hipped. He imagined that he was going to die; and suffered in quick succession all the diseases, that ever beset mortal man. Every shooting pain was an alarming symptom; —every uneasy feeling after dinner, a sure prognostic of some mortal disease. In vain did his friends endeavor to reason, and then to laugh him out of his strange whims; for when did ever jest or reason cure a sick imagination? His only answer was, “Do let me alone, I know better than you, what ails me.” Well, Gentlemen; things were in this state, when one afternoon in December, as he sat moping in his office, wrapped in an over-coat, with a cap on his head, and his feet thrust into a pair of furred slippers, a cabriolet stopped at the door, and a loud knocking without aroused him from his gloomy revery. It was a message 23 from his friend the wine-dealer, who had been suddenly attacked, the night before, with a violent fever, and growing worse and worse, had now sent in the greatest haste for the Notary to draw up his last will and testament. The case was urgent, and admitted neither excuse nor delay; and the Notary, tying a handkerchief round his face, and buttoning up to the chin, jumped into the cabriolet, and suffered himself, thought not without some dismal presentiments and misgivings of heart, to be driven to the wine-dealer's house. When he arrived, he found every thing in the greatest confusion. On entering the house, he ran against the apothecary, who was coming down stairs, with a face as long as your arm, and a pharmaceutical instrument somewhat longer; and a few steps farther, he met the housekeeper—for the wine-dealer was an old bachelor—running up and down, and wringing her hands, for fear that the good man should die—without making his will. He soon reached the chamber of his sick friend, and found him tossing about under a huge pile of bed-clothes, in a paroxysm of fever, calling aloud for a draught of cold water. The Notary shook his head; he thought this a fatal symptom; for ten years back, the wine-dealer had been suffering under a species of hydrophobia, which seemed suddenly to have left him. When the sick-man saw who stood by his bed-side, he stretched out his hand and exclaimed; “Ah! my dear friend! have you come at last?—You see it is all over with me. You have arrived just in time to draw up that—that passport of mine. Ah, grand diable! how hot it is here! Water—water—water! Will nobody give me a drop of cold water?” As the case was an urgent one, the Notary made no delay in getting his papers in readiness; and in a short time the last will and testament of the wine-dealer was drawn up in due form, the Notary guiding the sick-man's hand as he scrawled his signature at the bottom. As the evening wore away, the wine-dealer grew worse and worse, and at length became delirious, mingling in his incoherent ravings the phrases of the Credo and Pater-noster with the shibboleth of the dram-shop and the cardtable. “Take care! take care! There now— Credo in—pop! ting-a-ling-ling! give me some of that. Cent-é-dize! Why you old publican, this wine is poisoned—I know your tricks! —Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam. Well, well, we shall see. Imbecil! To have a tiercemajor and a seven of hearts, and discard the seven. By St. Anthony, capot! You are lurched—Ha! ha! I told you so. I knew very well—there—there—don't interrupt me—Carnis resurrectionem et vitam eternam!” With these words upon his lips, the poor wine-dealer expired. Meanwhile the Notary sat cowering over the fire, aghast at the fearful scene, that was passing before him, and now and then striving to keep up his courage by a glass of cognac. Already his fears were on the alert; and the idea of contagion flitted to and fro through his mind. In order to quiet these thoughts of evil import, he lighted his pipe, and began to prepare for returning home. At that moment the apothecary turned round to him, and said; “Dreadful sickly time, this! The disorder seems to be spreading.” “What disorder!” exclaimed the Notary, with a movement of surprise. “Two died yesterday, and three to day;” continued the apothecary without answering the question. “Very sickly time, Sir,—very.” “But what disorder is it? What disease has carried off my friend here so suddenly?” “What disease? Why scarlet fever, to be sure.” “And is it contagious?” “Certainly!” “Then I am a dead man!” exclaimed the Notary, putting his pipe into his waistcoat pocket, and beginning to walk up and down the room in despair. “I am a dead man!— Now don't deceive me—don't, will you!—What —what are the symptoms?” “A sharp, burning pain in the right side,” said the apothecary. “Oh, what a fool I was to come here! Take me home—take me home, and let me die in the bosom of my family!” In vain did the housekeeper and the apothecary strive to pacify him;—he was not a man to be reasoned with; he answered, that he knew his own constitution better than they did, and insisted upon going home without delay. Unfortunately, the vehicle he came in had returned to the city; and the whole neighborhood was a-bed and asleep. What was to be done? Nothing in the world but to take the apothocary's horse, which stood hitched at the door, patiently waiting his master's will. Well, Gentlemen; as there was no remedy, our Notary mounted this raw-boned steed, and set forth upon his homeward journey. The night was cold and gusty, and the wind set right in his teeth. Overhead the leaden clouds were beating to and fro, and through them the newly-risen moon seemed to be tossing and drifting along like a cock-boat in the surf; now swallowed up in a huge billow of cloud, and now lifted upon its bosom, and dashed with silvery spray. The trees by the road-side groaned with a sound of evil omen, and before him lay three mortal miles, beset with a thousand imaginary perils. Obedient to the whip and spur, the steed leaped forward by fits and starts, now dashing away in a tremendous gallop, and now relaxing into a long hard trot; while the rider, filled with symptoms of disease, and dire presentiments of death, urged him on, as if he were fleeing before the pestilence. In this way, by dint of whistling and shouting, and beating right and left, one mile of the fatal three was safely passed. The apprehensions of the Notary had so far subsided, that he even suffered the poor horse to walk up hill; but these apprehensions were suddenly revived again with tenfold violence by a sharp pain in the right side, which seemed to pierce him like a needle. “It is upon me at last!” groaned the fearstricken man. “Heaven be merciful to me, the greatest of sinners! And must I die in a ditch after all?—He! Get up—get up!” And away went horse and rider at full speed—hurry-skurry—up hill and down—panting and blowing like all possessed. At every leap, the pain in the rider's side seemed to increase. At first it was a little point like the prick of a needle—then it spread to the size of a half-franc piece—then covered a place as large as the palm of your hand. It gained upon him fast. The poor man groaned aloud in agony; faster and faster sped the horse over the frozen ground—farther and farther spread the pain over his side. To complete the dismal picture, the storm commenced,—snow mingled with rain. But snow, and rain, and cold were naught to him; for though his arms and legs were frozen to icicles, he felt it not; the fatal symptom was upon him; he was doomed to die,—not of cold, but of scarlet fever! At length, he knew not how, more dead than alive, he reached the gate of the city. A band of ill-bred dogs, that were serenading at a corner of the street, seeing the Notary dash by, joined in the hue and cry, and ran barking and yelping at his heels. It was now late at night, and only here and there a solitary lamp twinkled from an upper story. But on went the Notary, down this street and up that, till at last he reached his own door. There was a light in his wife's bed-chamber. The good woman came to the window, alarmed at such a knocking, and howling, and clattering at her door so late at night; and the Notary was too deeply absorbed in his own sorrows to observe that the lamp cast the shadow of two heads on the window-curtain. “Let me in! let me in! Quick! quick!” he exclaimed almost breathless from terror and fatigue. “Who are you, that come to disturb a lone woman at this hour of the night?” cried a sharp voice from above. “Begone about your business, and let quiet people sleep.” “Oh, diable, diable! Come down and let me in! I am your husband. Don't you know my voice? Quick, I beseech you; for I am dying here in the street!” After a few moments of delay and a few more words of parley, the door was opened, and the Notary stalked into his domicil pale and haggard in aspect, and as stiff and straight as a ghost. Cased from head to heel in an armor of ice, as the glare of the lamp fell upon him, he looked like a knight-errant mailed in steel. But in one place his armor was broken. On his right side was a circular spot, as large as the crown of your hat, and about as black! “My dear wife!” he exclaimed with more tenderness, than he had exhibited for many years; “Reach me a chair. My hours are numbered. I am a dead man!” 24 Alarmed at these exclamations, his wife stripped off his over-coat. Something fell from beneath it, and was dashed to pieces on the hearth. It was the Notary's pipe! He placed his hand upon his side, and lo! it was bare to the skin!—Coat, waistcoat and linen were burnt through and through, and there was a blister on his side as large over as your head! The mystery was soon explained, symptom and all. The Notary had put his pipe into his pocket without knocking out the ashes! And so my story ends. “Is that all?” asked the radical, when the story-teller had finished. “That is all.” “Well, what does your story go to prove? What bearing has it on the great interests of man?” “That is more than I can tell. All I know is that the story is true.” “And did he die?” said the nice little man in goslin green. “Yes; he died afterwards,” replied the story-teller, rather annoyed by the question. “And what did he die of?” continued goslin-green, following him up. “What did he die of?” winking to the rest of the company; “Why, he died—of a sudden!”</field>

The bud is in the bough, And the leaf is in the bud, And Earth's beginning now In her veins to feel the blood, Which, warmed by summer's sun In the alembic of the vine, From her founts will overrun, In a ruddy gush of wine. Felicia Hemans. Soft-breathing Spring! how many pleasant thoughts, how many delightful recollections does thy name awaken in the mind of a traveller! Whether he has followed thee by the banks of the Loire or the Guadalquivir, or traced thy footsteps, slowly climbing the sunny slope of Alp or Appenine, the thought of thee shall summon up sweet visions of the past, and thy golden sunshine, and soft, vapory atmosphere become a portion of his day dreams and of him. Sweet images of thee, and scenes that have oft inspired the poet's song, shall mingle in his recollections of the past. The shooting of the tender leaf,—the sweetness and elasticity of the air,—the blue sky and the fleet-drifting cloud, and the flocks of wild fowl, wheeling in long phalanx through the air, and screaming from their dizzy height,—all these shall pass like a dream before his imagination, `And gently o'er his memory come at times A glimpse of joys, that had their birth in thee, Like a brief strain of some forgotten tune.' It was at the opening of this delightful season of the year, that I passed through the South of France, and took the road of Saint Jean de Luz for the Spanish frontier. I left Bordeaux amid all the noise and gaiety of the last scene of Carnival. The streets and public walks of the city were full of merry groups in masks,—at every corner, crowds were listening to the discordant music of the wandering ballad-singer, and grotesque figures mounted on high stilts and dressed in the garb of the peasants of the Landes of Gascony, were stalking up and down like so many longlegged cranes;—others were amusing themselves with the tricks and grimaces of little monkeys, disguised like little men, bowing to the ladies, and figuring away in red coats and ruffles;—and here and there a band of chimney-sweeps were staring in stupid wonder at the miracles of a showman's box. In a word, all was so full of mirth and merrimake, that even beggary seemed to have forgotten, that it was wretched, and gloried in the ragged masquerade of one poor holiday. To this scene of noise and gaiety succeeded the silence and solitude of the Landes of Gascony. The road from Bordeaux to Bayonne winds along through immense pine forests, and sandy plains, spotted here and there with a dingy little hovel, and the silence is interrupted only by the dismal, hollow roar of the wind among the melancholy and majestic pines. Occasionally, however, the way is enlivened by a market town or a straggling village; and I still recollect the feelings of delight, which I experienced, when just after sunset we passed through the romantic town of Roquefort, built upon the sides of the green valley of the Douze, which has scooped out a verdant hollow for it to nestle in, amid the barren tracts of sand around. On leaving Bayonne the scene assumes a character of greater beauty and sublimity. To the vast forests of the Landes of Gascony, succeeds a scene of picturesque beauty, delightful to the traveller's eye. Before him rise the snowy Pyrenees,—a long line of undulating hills, `Bounded afar by peak aspiring bold, Like giant capt with helm of burnished gold.' To the left, as far as the eye can reach, stretch the delicious valleys of the Nive and Adour, and to the right the sea flashes along the pebbly margin of its silver beach, forming a thousand little bays and inlets, or comes tumbling in among the cliffs of a rock-bound coast, and beats against its massive barriers, with a distant, hollow, continual roar. Should these pages meet the eye of any solitary traveller, who is journeying into Spain, by the road I here speak of, I would 25 advise him to travel from Bayonne to Saint Jean de Luz on horse back. At the gate of Bayonne he will find a steed ready caparisoned for him, with a dark eyed Basque girl for his companion and guide, who is to sit beside him upon the same horse. This style of travelling is, I believe, peculiar to the Basque provinces; at all events I have seen it nowhere else. The saddle is constructed with a large frame-work extending on each side, and covered with cushions; and the traveller and his guide being placed on the opposite extremities, serve as a balance to each other. We overtook many travellers mounted in this way, and I could not help thinking it a mode of travelling far preferable to being cooped up in a diligence. The Basque girls are generally beautiful; and there was one of these merry guides, we met upon the road to Bidart, whose image haunts me still. She had large and expressive black eyes,—teeth like pearls,—a rich and sun-burnt complexion, and hair of a glossy blackness, parted on the forehead, and falling down behind in a large braid, so long as almost to touch the ground with the little ribbon, that confined it at the end. She wore the common dress of the peasantry of the South of France, and a large gipsey straw hat was thrown back over her shoulder, and confined by a ribbon about her neck. There was hardly a dusty traveller in the coach, who did not envy her companion, the seat he occupied beside her. Just at night-fall we entered the town of Saint Jean de Luz, and dashed down its narrow streets at full gallop. The little mad-cap postillion, cracked his knotted whip incessantly, and the sound echoed back from the high, dingy walls like the report of a pistol. The coach-wheels nearly touched the houses on each side of us;—the idlers in the street jumped right and left to save themselves; window-shutters flew open in all directions; a thousand heads popped out from cellar and upper story; Sacr-r-ré mâtin! shouted the postillion,—and we rattled on like an earthquake. Saint Jean de Luz is a smoky little fishing town, situated on the low grounds at the mouth of the Nivelle, and a bridge connects it with the faubourg of Sibourne, which stands on the opposite bank of the river. I had no time, however, to note the peculiarities of the place, for I was whirled out of it, with the same speed and confusion with which I had been whirled in, and I can only recollect the sweep of the road across the Nivelle—the church of Sibourne by the water's edge—the narrow streets—the smoky looking houses, with red window-shutters, and “a very ancient and fish-like smell.” I passed by moonlight the little river Bidasoa, which forms the boundary between France and Spain; and when the morning broke found myself far up among the mountains of San Salvador, the most westerly links of the great Pyrenean chain. The mountains around me were neither rugged nor precipitous; but they rose one above another in a long majestic swell, and the trace of the plough-share was occasionally visible to their summits. They seemed entirely destitute of forest scenery; and as the season of vegetation had not yet commenced, their huge outlines lay black and barren, and desolate against the sky. But it was a glorious morning; and the sun rose up into a cloudless heaven, and poured a flood of gorgeous splendor over the mountain landscape, as if proud of the realm he shone upon. The scene was enlivened by the dashing of a swollen mountain-brook, whose course we followed for miles down the valley, as it leaped onward to its journey's end, now breaking into a white cascade, and now foaming and chafing beneath a rustic bridge. Now and then we rode through a dilapidated town, with a group of idlers at every corner, wrapped in tattered brown cloaks, and smoking their little paper cigars in the sun. Then would succeed a desolate tract of country cheered only by the tinkle of a mule-bell, or the song of a muleteer. Then we would meet a solitary traveller, mounted on horseback, and wrapped in the ample folds of his cloak, with a gun hanging at the pommel of his saddle. Occasionally, too, among the bleak, inhospitable hills, we passed a rude little chapel, with a cluster of ruined cottages around it; and whenever our carriage stopped at the relay, or loitered slowly up the hill-side, a crowd of children would gather around us, with little images and crucifixes for sale, curiously ornamented with ribbons, and little bits of tawdry finery. A day's journey from the frontier brought us to Vitoria, where the diligence stopped for the night. I spent the scanty remnant of daylight in rambling about the streets of the city, with no other guide but the whim of the moment. Now I plunged down a dark and narrow alley,—now emerged into a wide street, or a spacious market-place, and now aroused the drowsy echoes of a church or cloister with the sound of my intruding footsteps. But descriptions of churches and public squares are dull and tedious matters for those readers, who are in search of amusement and not of instruction; and if any one has accompanied me thus far on my fatiguing journey towards the Spanish capital, I will readily excuse him from the toil of an evening ramble through the streets of Vitoria. On the following morning we left Vitoria long before day-break, and during our forenoon's journey, the postillion drew up at a relay, on the southern slope of the Sierra de San Lorenzo in the province of Old Castile. The house was an old, dilapidated tenement, built of rough stone, and coarsely plastered upon the outside. The tiled roof had long been the sport of wind and rain, the motley coat of plaster was broken and time-worn, and the whole building sadly out of repair; though the fanciful mouldings under the eaves, and the curiously carved wood-work, that supported the little balcony over the principal entrance, spoke of better days gone by. The whole building reminded me of a dilapidated Spanish Don, down at the heel and out at elbows, but with here and there a remnant of former magnificence peeping through the loopholes of his tattered cloak. A wide gate-way ushered the traveller into the interior of the building, and conducted him to a low-roofed apartment, paved with round stones, and serving both as a court-yard and a stable. It seemed to be a neutral ground for man and beast;—a little republic, where horse and rider had common privileges, and mule and muleteer lay cheek by jowl. In one corner a poor jackass was patiently devouring a bundle of musty straw,—in another its master lay sound asleep with his saddle-cloth for a pillow; here, a group of muleteers were quarrelling over a pack of dirty cards,— and there the village barber with a self-important air, stood laving the alcalde's chin from the helmet of Mambrino. On the wall a little taper glimmered feebly before an image of Saint Anthony; directly opposite these, a leathern wine-bottle hung by the neck from a pair of ox-horns; and the pavement below was covered with a curious medley of boxes, and bags, and cloaks, and pack-saddles, and sacks of grain, and skins of wine, and all kinds of lumber. A small door upon the right led us into the inn-kitchen. It was a room about ten feet square, and literally all chimney; for the hearth was in the centre of the floor, and the walls sloped upward in the form of a long tapering pyramid, with an opening at the top for the escape of the smoke. Quite round this little room ran a row of benches, upon which sat one or two grave personages smoking paper cigars. Upon the hearth blazed a handful of faggots, whose bright flame danced merrily among a motley congregation of pots and kettles, and a long wreath of smoke wound lazily up through the huge tunnel of the roof above. The walls were black with soot, and ornamented with sundry legs of bacon and festoons of sausages; and as there were no windows in this dingy abode, the only light, which cheered the darkness within, came flickering from the fire upon the hearth, and the smoky sunbeams, that peeped down the long-necked chimney. I had not been long seated by the fire, when the tinkling of mule bells, the clatter of hoofs, and the hoarse voice of a muleteer in the outer apartment announced the arrival of new guests. A few moments afterward, the kitchen door opened and a person entered, whose appearance strongly arrested my attention. It was a tall athletic figure, with the majestic carriage of a grandee, and a dark sun-burnt countenance, that indicated an age of about fifty years. His dress was singular, and such as I had not before seen. He wore a round hat, with wide flapping brim, from beneath which his long black hair hung in 26 curls upon his shoulders; a leather jerkin, with cloth sleeves, descended to his hips; around his waist was closely buckled a leather belt, with a cartouche-box on one side; a pair of Marmeluke pantaloons of black serge hung in ample folds to the knees, around which they were closely gathered by embroidered garters of blue silk; and black broadcloth leggings, buttoned close to the calves, and strapped over a pair of brown leather shoes, completed the singular dress of the stranger. He doffed his hat as he entered, and saluting the company with a “Dios guarde á Ustedes, caballeros,” (God guard you, gentlemen) took a seat by the fire, and entered into conversation with those around him. As my curiosity was not a little excited by the peculiar dress of this person, I inquired of a travelling companion, who sat at my elbow, who and what this new-comer was. From him I learned that he was a muleteer of the Maragatería, a name given to a cluster of small towns which lie in the mountainous country between Astorga and Villafranca, in the western corner of the kingdom of Leon. “Nearly every province in Spain,” said he, “has its peculiar costume, as you will see, when you have advanced farther into our country. For instance, the Catalonians wear crimson caps, hanging down upon the shoulder like a sack; wide pantaloons of green velvet, long enough in the waistband to cover the whole breast; and a little strip of a jacket, made of the same material, and so short as to bring the pocket directly under the arm-pit. The Valencians, on the contrary, go almost naked; a linen shirt, wide linen trowsers, reaching no lower than the knees, and a pair of coarse leather sandals complete their simple garb; it is only in mid-winter, that they indulge in the luxury of jacket. The most beautiful and expensive costume, however, is that of Andalusia. It consists of a velvet jacket, faced with rich, and various-colored embroidery, and covered with tassels and silken cord; a vest of some gay color; a silken handkerchief round the neck, and a crimson sash round the waist; breeches, that button down each side; gaiters and shoes of white leather; and a handkerchief of bright-colored silk wound round the head like a turban, and surmounted by a velvet cap, or a little round hat, with a wide band, and an abundance of silken loops and tassels. The Old Castilians are more grave in their attire. They wear a leather breast-plate instead of a jacket; a montera cap, breeches and leggings. This fellow is a Maragato; and in the villages of the Maragatería the costume varies a little from the rest of Leon and Castile.” “If he is indeed a Maragato,” said I jestingly, “who knows, but he may be a descendant of the muleteer, who behaved so naughtily at Cacabelos, as related in the second chapter of the veracious history of Gil Blas de Santillana.” “¿ Quien sabe?” was the reply. “Notwithstanding the pride, which even the meanest Castillian feels in counting over a long line of good-for-nothing ancestors, the science of genealogy has become of late a very intricate study in Spain.” Here our conversation was cut short by the mayoral of the diligence, who came to tell us, that the mules were waiting; and before many hours had elapsed, we were scrambling through the square of the ancient city of Burgos. On the morrow we crossed the river Duero and the Guadarama mountains, and early in the afternoon entered the “Heroica Villa” of Madrid by the Puerta de Fuencarral.</field>
