PEASE. “The Gift for 1840 is decidedly the best and most elegant, not only of its particular family, but of the race to which it belongs. The binding is peculiarly rich and tasteful; and all the engravings with one exception, are remarkably beautiful. Of the literary contents we can also speak in terms of almost unqualified praise— much better than anything we have read in any of the English Annuals.” —New York Commercial Advertiser. “Its exterior is superbly beautiful—the paper and typography elegant—and the graphic embellishments a little superior, in our judgment, to those of any of its cotemporary Annuals.” —Boston Courier. “The number of the Gift for the coming year, presents attractions equal, if not superior to those of any Annual which we have ever seen issued from an American press. The binding is chaste, and superb; and the engravings, nine in number, are, without a single exception, of the highest finish and beauty, while some are surpassingly fine.” —Lady's Companion. “A most superb affair, and with the exception of a few of the more costly English publications of the same kind, we have seen no superior to it.” —Boston Post. “Among the Annuals for 1840, the “Gift” stands decidedly the first, It is superbly bound—printed on clear white paper, in the most beautiful and faultless style—and its nine embellishments are finished specimens of engraving, and furnish a fine illustration of the perfection to which the arts are brought in this country.” —Bost. Mer. Journal. “This graceful and prettily got up volume, does credit to our transatlantic rivals, in both the points of view in which its pretensions lie. Its literature is as various and worthy of commendation as that of most of those with which it has had to compete from our side of the Atlantic, and its pictorial claims are of corresponding merit and attraction.” —New Monthly. “This, the 4th volume of the “Gift,” is, in all respects, superior to its predecessors, and is a remarkably beautiful and excellent book. The plates, with a single exception, are engraved by American engravers, from original pictures, painted by American painters.” —Gentleman's Magazine. “The Gift, for 1840, is, we think, a superior number in all its components parts, and may challenge competition with any Annual that has been issued in this country. The engravings, which are truly beautiful, are all original, and several of them are from paintings by Sully.” —U. S. Gaz.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TO M— L—, OF ALABAMA. This shall be yours, Monna. However doubtful of its deserts, I can no longer forbear my acknowledgment of yours. What there is good in my story you will be the first to find—what there is evil or worthless, for my sake, at least, you will be the first to forget. Let this tribute remind you rather of the affection which always keeps you in thought, than of any presumptuous self-estimate on the part of him who prays still for your kindliest memories.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. My first book was held objectionable by many as too stern and gloomy in its character. The present may be in some respects censurable for the other extreme. I should feel it less easy to excuse its levities, than to account for the gravity of its predecessor. Let them balance each other. The reader is requested to be indulgent to the inaccuracies of the press, some of which, in “Richard Hurdis,” were of an annoying and awkward kind; all of them, perhaps, are attributable rather to the writer than the printer. In the first edition of “Richard Hurdis,” first volume, page 210, the “Alabama” is erroneously printed for the “Tombecbe river.” The same error is repeated at page 162, of the second edition. In the same volume, first edition, page 177, “Jane Hurdis,” is improperly printed for “Jane Pickett.” This error is corrected in the second edition. In the present work, “des règles” occurs for “les règles” at page 69, vol. i.; and there will be found, scattered through the work, numerous small mistakes of like character, which the reader, while he corrects them, is at liberty to ascribe to the ignorance, the inexperience, or the carelessness of all concerned. An author, removed a thousand miles from his printer and the public, is little likely to heed their clamours about inaccuracies, which the same circumstance makes him peculiarly liable to commit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 2 CHAPTER I. “I have got A seat to sit at ease here, in mine inn, To see the comedy; and laugh and chuck At the variety and throng of humours, And dispositions that come jostling in And out.” Ben Jonson —The New Inn. The little town of Raymond, in the state of Mississippi, was in the utmost commotion. Court-day was at hand, and nothing was to be heard but the hum of preparation for that most important of all days in the history of a country village—that of general muster alone excepted. Strange faces and strange dresses began to show themselves in the main street; lawyers were entering from all quarters—“saddlebag” and “sulky” lawyers—men who cumber themselves with no weight of law, unless it can be contained in moderately-sized heads, or valise, or saddle-bag, of equally moderate dimensions. Prowling sheriff's officers began to show their hands again, after a ten or twenty days' absence in the surrounding country, where they had gone to the great annoyance of simple farmers, who contract large debts to the shop-keeper on the strength of crops yet to be planted, which are thus wasted on changeable silks for the spouse, and whistle-handled whips for “Young Hopeful” the only son and heir to possession, which, in no long time will be heard best of under the auctioneer's hammer. The population of the village was increasing rapidly; and what with the sharp militia colonel, in his new box coat, squab white hat, trim collar and high-heeled boots, seeking to find favour in the regiment against the next election for supplying the brigadier's vacancy; the swaggering planter to whom certain disquieting hints of foreclosure have been given, which he can evade no longer, and which he must settle as he may; the slashing overseer, prime for cockfight or quarterrace, and not unwilling to try his own prowess upon his neighbour, should occasion serve and all other sports fail; the pleading and impleaded, prosecutor and prosecuted, witnesses and victims,—Raymond never promised more than at present to swell beyond all seasonable boundaries, and make a noise in the little world round it. Court-day is a day to remember in the West, either for the parts witnessed or the parts taken in the various performances; and whether the party be the loser of an eye or ear, or has merely helped another to the loss of both, the case is still pretty much the same; the event is not usually forgotten. The inference was fair that there would be a great deal of this sort of prime brutality performed at the present time. Among the crowd might be seen certain men who had already distinguished themselves after this manner, and who strutted and swaggered from pillar to post, as if conscious that the eyes of many were upon them, either in scorn or admiration. Notoriety is a sort of fame which the vulgar mind essentially enjoys beyond any other; and we are continually reminded, while in the crowd, of the fellow in the play, who says he “loves to be contemptible.” Some of these creatures had lost an eye, some an ear, others had their faces scarred with the strokes of knives; and a close inspection of others might have shown certain tokens about their necks, which testified to bloody ground fights, in which their gullets formed an acquaintance with the enemy's teeth, not over-well calculated to make them desire new terms of familiarity. Perhaps, in most cases, these wretches had only been saved from just punishment by the humane intervention of the spectators—a humanity that is too often warmed into volition, only when the proprietor grows sated with the sport. At one moment the main street in Raymond was absolutely choked by the press of conflicting vehicles. Judge Bunkell's sulky hitched wheels with the carriage of Col. Fishhawk, and squire Dickens' bran new barouche, brought up from Orleans only a week before, was “staved all to flinders”—so said our landlady—“agin the corner of Joe Richards' stable.” The 'squire himself narrowly escaped the very last injury in the power of a fourfooted beast to inflict, that is disposed to use his hoofs heartily—and, bating an abrasion of the left nostril, which diminished the size, if it did not, as was the opinion of many, impair the beauty of the member, Dickens had good reason to congratulate himself at getting off with so little personal damage. These, however, were not the only mishaps on this occasion. There were other stories of broken heads, maims and injuries, but whether they grew out of the unavoidable concussion of a large crowd in a small place, or from a great natural tendency to broken heads on the part of the owners, it scarcely falls within our present purpose to inquire. A jostle in a roomy region like the west, is any thing but a jostle in the streets of New York. There you may tilt the wayfarer into the gutter, and the laugh is against the loser, it being a sufficient apology for taking such a liberty with your neighbour's person, that “business is business, and must be attended to.” Every man must take care of himself and learn to push with the rest, where all are in a hurry. But he brooks the stab who jostles his neighbour where there is no such excuse; and the stab is certain where he presumes so far with his neighbour's wife, or his wife's daughter, or his sister. There's no pleading that the city rule is to “take the right hand” —he will let you know that the proper rule is to give way to the weak and feeble—to women, to age, to infancy. This is the manly rule among the strong, and a violation of it brings due punishment in the west. Jostling there is a dangerous experiment, and for this very reason, it is frequently practised by those who love a row and fear no danger. It is one of the thousand modes resorted to for compelling the fight of fun—the conflict which the rowdy seeks from the mere love of tumult, and in the excess of overheated blood. If there was a sensation among the “arrivals” at Raymond, there was scarcely less among the residents. The private houses were soon full of visiters, and the public of guests. Major Mandrake's tavern was crammed from top to bottom; and this afflicting dispensation led to the strangest disruption of anciently adjusted beds and bedsteads. Miss Artemisia Mandrake, for example, was compelled to yield her cushions, to a horse-drover from Tennessee, and content herself with such “sleeps,” as she could find in an old arm-chair, that stood in immemorial dust in a sort of pigeon-roost garret. It was to this necessity, we may be permitted to say in this place, that she for ever after ascribed her rheumatism, and a certain awry contraction of the muscles of the neck, which, defeating her other personal charms, was not inaptly assumed, by the damsel herself, to have been the true cause of her remaining, up to the time of this writing, an unappropriated spinster. Major Mandrake has certainly 2* had excellent reason to repent his cupidity. The rival tavern of Captain Crumbaugh was in equally fortunate condition with that of the Major. They were both filled to overflowing by midday, and after that you could get a bed in neither for love nor money. And yet the folks continued to arrive; folks of all conditions and from all quarters, in gig and sulky, or on horseback; some riding in pairs on the same donkey,—and not a few short-petticoated damsels, led by curiosity, from the neighbouring farms, and mounted in like manner, on battered jades, whose mouths, ossified by repeated jerks, now defied the strenuous efforts by which the riders would have sent them forward with some show of life and spirit, as they emerged from the forests into the crowded thoroughfare. “Well, there's a heap of folks still a-coming, and where in the world they'll find a place to lie down in to-night, is a'most past my reckoning. I'm sure the major ha'n't got another bed left, high nor low; and as for the captain, I heard him tell Joe Zeigler, an hour ago, that all was full with him. Yet, do look, how they are a-coming. Can't you look, Jack Horsey, if it's only for a minute. You hav'n't got no more nateral curiosity than—” “Shut up, Bess, you've got enough for both of us. What's it to me, and what's it to you, where the folks sleep. Let them sleep where they can; there'll be no want of beds where there's no want of money. If they have that, the captain and the major will take good care that they have every opportunity to spend it. As for you, go you and see after the poultry; court-time is a mighty bad season for chickens; they die off very sudden, and the owner is not always the wiser of the sort of death they die. Push, Bess, and see if you can forget for awhile the business of the two taverns.” The good wife was silent for a space, but this was the only acknowledgment which she condescended to yield her stubborn and incurious husband. She did not leave her place at the window, but continued to gaze with the satisfaction of a much younger person, at the throng in the thoroughfare, as it received additions momently from every new arrival. At length the stir appeared to cease—the carriages to disappear; horses vanished in the custody of bustling ostlers, and their riders, making amends for the day's abstinence, on a dry road, might be seen, in great part, at the bar-room of the Major or the Captain, washing away the dust from capacious throats by occasional draughts of whisky or peach brandy. The latter article seemed most in demand at the house of Captain Crumbaugh. He had the art of preparing it to perfection; and “Crumbaugh's peach” was, in my day, a sort of proverb with all who travelled in his parts. Major Mandrake took care to have the very best whisky—of particular strength and peculiar flavour; and there was a class, and this no small one neither, that might readily be found to give it preference. I class myself among none of these. The oily excellence of the peach of Crumbaugh is still a flavour on “memory's waste;” (query, “taste?”) and whisky was never a favourite of mine, though I have partaken of it along with governors and judges, senators and saints. But to return to the curious Mrs. Horsey. The dispersion of the crowd, as it ceased to furnish her with any new subjects of interest, necessarily left her somewhat more free to remember the injunctions of her husband; and she was about to turn from the window, with a long drawn sigh of weariness, or dissatisfaction that the show was over, when a smart-looking youth, whom she did not know, rode up to her door. “Oh, Mr. Horsey,—a gentleman—on a fine roan horse—he's at the door—I reckon he wants to see some of us, and maybe comes to look after a lodging for to-night. I knew the major was full, and the captain—” “Now, the devil take the major and the captain, and all the taverns in the state, since they drive every thing out of your brain that ought to be there;” was the angry speech with which the stubborn husband interrupted the wandering soliloquy of his spouse. “Why don't you see what the stranger wants, woman?—you heard his knocking, and there you stand, guessing about tavern business, and such matters as you've no need to think, much less to speak about.” “La! John Horsey—you're too positive and contrarious; not let a body think—” “No! What the devil should you think for? that's my business, I tell you now, as I've told you a good hundred times before. But go to the door; don't stand there staring like a gray owl in a green bush; go and open the door and see what the man wants, unless you desire that I should get up with my lame leg and show him in. Won't you go, I ask you.” “Well, John, don't you see I'm going? You're always in such a fret.” “Enough cause too, with such a trouble as you are.” “Yes, sometimes I'm any thing but a trouble; there's no word you have too good for me; and then agin—” “There's none too bad;” said the splenetic husband, finishing the speech as she had begun it; “but go to the door, as if you had some life in you, or the stranger will batter it down before you get there.” There was some reason, indeed, for the apprehension expressed by Horsey, as the applicant for admission, seeing that no heed was given to his first summons, yet hearing, without doubt, a buzzing of the sharp controversy going on within, had renewed his application with redoubled force, employing for the purpose the but of a loaded whip, every stroke of which told like a hammer upon the plank. The dame started in compliance with the clamours from without, rather than the impatient commands within; for she still seemed panting for another word, and muttered between her teeth, as she slowly moved towards the door, something which, to the jealous authority of her liege lord, seemed to denote a resolution still to think as she pleased and when she pleased, in spite of his declarations against her right to do so. “Look you, Bess, go to the door: and move a little more quickly, if you don't want to make me mighty angry. See what the stranger wants; and remember we don't keep a lodging-house any longer. We have no room; we want no company.” This was spoken in those subdued tones, and with that show of suppressed and striving feeling, which, perhaps, denote a greater degree of earnestness and resolution than any words might do. The effect upon the wife was instantaneous, and her hand was soon upon the lock. “Remember, we have no lodging,” murmured the husband, as the door opened. “I only wish I were a mile or two back in the woods, where I mightn't be worried as I am about board. There was a time when I might have been glad of a good stand on the road, but it's not so now. I can live like a gentleman, and why should I be bothered to get breakfasts, and see after strange horses, for people I shall never see but once, and don't want to see at all? I'll—” The words of the stranger, spoken in bold, free, musical language, which reached the ears of the invalid at that moment, put an end to the soliloquy. “Mrs. Horsey, ma'am?” “He might swear to it, if he knew only half as much as I,” exclaimed the invalid. The stranger, a tall, well-made youth of twenty-five or thereabouts, meanwhile, drew up his steed, lifted his cap handsomely from his head, like one born a courtier, with a grace that found its way instantly to the lady's heart, and proceeded in his inquiries. “I have been advised, Mrs. Horsey, by a particular friend, to seek lodgings at your house during my stay in Raymond. Can I have them?” Before the good lady, prefacing her denial with a long apology and a pleasant smirk of the face, could bring out what she was preparing to say, the rough voice of the sultan from within, gave his answer to the stranger. “Can't have 'em, my friend—this is no lodging-house—no room to spare.” “Very sorry, indeed,” said the old lady. “Not sorry at all, stranger,” said the truth-speaking Horsey; “for you see, if we wanted to lodge you, the thing might well enough be done. But we don't set out to keep company, and there are taverns enough in the village.” “Scarcely, if the story is true, that they are all full,” replied the stranger; “but let me alight and see you. I have a message to you, madam, and to your husband from my friend Carter, who tells me that he lodges with you, and that you could easily find me lodgings also for the little time I mean to stay in Raymond.” The effect of this speech was instantaneous upon the man of the house. He barely heard the youth through ere he replied,— “Eh! what's that you say, my friend? Did you say, Carter—was it Ben Carter that sent the message?” “The same,” replied the youth, while entering the house. “And why the d—l, stranger, didn't you say so at first, without any prevarications. What's the use of this cursed long palaver, when two words could have done the whole business. Of course we can give you lodgings. Ben Carter told you nothing but the truth. He has a habit of speaking the truth which would be very good for many other people to take up, not meaning you, stranger, for if you be a friend of Ben Carter, I reckon, it's like you are of the same sort of stuff.” “You speak only as my friend deserves, Mr. Horsey. Carter is the very man you describe him. True in all his words, and just in all his dealings with men, it is my pride in esteeming him one of the most valuable and closest friends I have. It is not amiss, Mr. Horsey, to add that he has an opinion of you, no less favourable than yours of him.” “Tush, young man, soft soap don't tickle me at my time of life,” replied Horsey with an Indian grunt of seeming indifference. “I am as I am, and it's no great matter what I am, seeing that I'm of little use in this world at present, and likely to be of less; yet it's not a bad thing to have the good words of them that's good. It sort o' reconciles a man to a great many evil things that might otherwise bring him a mighty deal of trouble. And Ben Carter is a good man,—when did you see him last?” “Some ten days ago. He left me at Monticello, and was on his way to Jackson, from which place he promised to return directly to this. He was to meet me here to-night.” “Well, I reckon he'll be as good as his word, if there's nothing to stop him on the way. He's mighty punctual to his business, and when he says he'll do, you may count it done. True as steel, is Ben Carter, and it's no use to say farther. Bess, let's have something. What'll you take, stranger?— there's some mighty fine peach, some of Crumbaugh's peach, as they call it, which is pretty much the same as calling it the very best in Massissippi. I have some old Monongahela besides, which I can speak a good word for—sugar, Bess.” The beverage was soon prepared, and the two were about to drink, when Horsey reminded the other of a degree of inequality between them which needed to be reconciled before they could properly drink health together. “You have all the advantage on your side, stranger; my name's John Horsey,—that, it seems, you know already; but yours—what's your name? There's no pleasure in calling a man `stranger' every minute, when you're talking and drinking together all the while.” “True,” replied the stranger; “but I never thought of that. My name, Mr. Horsey, is Vernon—Harry Vernon. It is not improbable that you have heard it before from my friend Carter.” “Don't recollect, don't think I ever did. Vernon, Vernon—it's a good name enough—comes smooth and easy to the tongue as a gentleman's name ought to do always; but Harry, Harry Vernon! You wasn't christened Harry, I reckon, Mr. Vernon? Must have been Henry, and they call you Harry for short.” “For short, say you? Well, it may be so,” replied the stranger with a laugh, “but long or short, I was never called by any other since I have known myself; and never, until this moment thought of asking which of the two I had the clearest right to make use of.” “The old people living, Mr. Vernon? Your health, sir, in the meantime. That's what I call peach brandy, sir,—no make b'lieve,—none of your whisky run through peach timber such as they give you at Orleans. Old Crumbaugh warrants that stuff, and gets his price for it. Did I hear you, Mr. Vernon? the old people, you said they were living.” “Neither, sir.” “Try another sip, Mr. Vernon,” said the other consolingly, “peach perfectly harmless; Crumbaugh keeps the temperate society house; warrants his peach; calls it sobriety peach; and so you've lost both parents, Mr. Vernon?” “Both—all, sir. I may almost exclaim with the Indian, that there runs no drop of my blood in the veins of any human being.” “Don't say that, Mr. Vernon, don't say that. It's much more than any man can say, and be certain. Fathers, sir, are apt to leave children where they never look for them; there's something of that sort at my own door, Mr. Vernon, and so—” “La, John, how you do talk.” “What, you're there, Bess, are you?” The chuckle of the veteran was arrested, and probably a long string of confessions, by the timely ejaculation of his wife, who happened to be busy in the closet,— “these women, Mr. Vernon—but you're married?” “No!” “Be thankful, young master—it's a pleasure then to come, if it comes as a pleasure, which is something like Bazil Hunter's pea crop, `a very doubtful up-coming.' You will run your race like the rest of us, and come up at the post as usual, but it won't be VOL. I. 3 the starting-post, I tell you! You was saying something about the Indians, and that brought up some recollections of mine when I was among them. I've been among all the Southern Indians, except the Catawba. I've never been among them, and I reckon there's but few of them now left to see; but I've been among the Creeks and the Cherokees, the Choctaws and the Chickasaws, and there was another tribe, when I first came into these parts, that I hear nothing of now, called the Leaf River Indians, there was but few of them, and I think they belonged to the Chickasaws, but they were the handsomest Indians I ever did see in all my travelling, and I begun early. I used to trade, when I was little, a mere sprout of a boy, from Tennessee, through the mountains, into North and South Carolina,—then after that to the Massissippi; and many's the time I've made out to carry a matter of five pack-horses,—I and three other lads of Tennessee—through the very heart of the `nation,' without so much as losing a thimble, and almost without having a scare. In one of these journeys I saw my wife, then a mere bit of a girl.—What! not gone, Bess!—It's gospel truth, Mr. Harry Vernon, from that day there's been but one pack-horse in our family, and that's Jack Horsey himself.” “La! now, John,” cried the wife with uplifted hands, “the stranger don't know your ways, and he'll take for true what you're a-telling him. That's jist the way with him, stranger—” “Stranger!—the gentleman's got a name, Bess. Mr. Vernon, Mr. Harry Vernon; remember, now, it's not Henry, but Harry Vernon.—Mr. Vernon, this is my wife. You'd soon enough find that out, if you lodged with us awhile. And now, Bess, be off, and look after supper;—a silent wife, and a singing kettle—it's not always we can have 'em, Mr. Vernon, but that only helps to make them the more desirable.” Mrs. Horsey was not to be sent off, however, in so conclusive a manner. The complaints of Horsey, touching the constraints upon him of his better half, were ludicrous enough; contrasted, as they were, with the almost despotic sway which he exercised at every instant. Perhaps a latent desire to show her guest that her good lord did not have it altogether his own way, led her on this occasion to dispute his commands. “It's not time for supper, John Horsey. Now that you're lame, you seem to think of nothing but eating and drinking.” “Did mortal husband ever hear to such a woman?” was the exclamation of the sultan. The wife mistook for compliance a mildness in the speech which was only due to the astonishment of the speaker. She continued:— “It's a good hour to supper yet. We have our hours, John Horsey, jist the same as the major, and—” “Now d—n the major, and d—n the captain, and d—n all the taverns in Massissippi. Thus it is, Mr. Vernon, a wife will make a man swear, sir, when there's nothing in the world farther from his wish. You see, sir, my wife will do and say just what she pleases, as I told you. She will always be bringing up to me those cursed taverns; but I'll stop that, or there's no snakes! Look you, Betsey!” Here his finger guided her to the door, through which she made her departure in the shortest possible space of time. A look had done what, probably, no word in John Horsey's vocabulary could have achieved half so soon. “A good woman enough, Mr. Vernon; but women, sir, are women; and the very best of them are incapable of serious concerns: they are all triflers— mere children—a sort of gingerbread creatures, the ginger of which lasts a deused sight longer than the molasses. But, as you were saying, Mr. Vernon, you are a lawyer.” “You have guessed rightly, sir, that is my profession indeed. Your ears are something better than mine, I think, for I do not recollect ever having told you the fact.” “Nor did you, my dear fellow,” replied the old man with a hearty laugh. “It was, as you say, a mere guess of mine, and Jack Horsey's guess is seldom short of the mark. It's a way with me to take for granted, just as if my neighbour had said it, the thing which it appears to me reasonable to think he will say; and I could ha' sworn, from a rakish, sharp, lively something about your face and eyes, and a little swing of your shoulders, that you was a lawyer, or going soon to be one. You practise in Monticello.” “I came from Monticello last, but it is not my residence.” “Well, but you practise law somewhere in Massissippi.” “I shall in season, I doubt not, provided I get clients. Young lawyers find in this their chief difficulty. They practise with some such rule as governs a good angler,—where the fish bite best, there you are sure to find them. For my part, I am but too lately admitted to determine where the best water lies for my purposes; I have not yet thrown out my lines.” “And that you won't do till your hooks are well baited, for that I believe is one of the first lessons which a lawyer learns. I know'd if you had begun to practise, you hadn't done much in that way; your chin is almost too smooth, though that's no misfortune as times go, if so be your tongue proves smooth and oily like your chin. But there, it seems to me, Mr. Vernon, that your difficulty lies. I'm afraid you ha'n't got the gift of the gab. I haven't heard you say much.” “And for a very excellent reason, Mr. Horsey: you haven't given me a chance. Your tongue has utterly outwagged mine, and I yield the palm to you, where my vanity, perhaps, would allow me to yield it to few other persons. But, it is now my turn, and if I do not prove myself quite your equal before I'm done with you, I will at least convince you that I am not entirely without my claims to take rank among the mouthing part of my profession.” “Spoken like a man, and a good fellow,” cried Horsey, with a hearty laugh, and with no sort of discomfiture at a retort as just as it was unexpected. “I have better hopes of you now, Mr. Harry Vernon. 'Ecod, you gave it me then,—a raal dig in the side with a sharp elbow. The truth is, I am a leetle too much given to hearing myself talk, and what's worse, I can't easily be convinced that it is not my neighbour whose tongue all the while has been making the hellabaloo. Somehow or other, thinking of what the man ought to say, that I'm talking to, I come to think he says it, and half an hour after, could almost take my Bible oath to the fact. It's a strange infirmity, Mr. Vernon; don't you think so?” “Very,—very strange,” said the other, smiling at the seeming seriousness of his companion. “And so, you were telling me you practise law in Orleans.” “No—” “Ah, Mobile, yes—Mobile you said.” “Nay, nay, Mr. Horsey, I said neither,” replied the youth laughing out aloud; “this is only another sample of the infirmity you were telling me about— 3* another of your guesses—and I will not tell you how far from the truth. But it is my turn now, and while I throw another stick upon your fire, and draw my chair a foot closer, I will prepare my thoughts for the cross-examination which I mean to give you in turn.” “Ah, well; but `wait a bit and take a bit,' first, as we say in Massissippi. We'll have it over after supper, when you may try your skill upon me, for a first witness, and see what you'll get for going. I'm a tough colt to ride, when the bit hurts me; and he must be a skilful rider, indeed, if he saves himself a throw.” “We shall see, we shall see,” said Vernon confidently, and with a smile of good nature; while the old man, with whose humour the course which the youth had taken seemed admirably to tally, told him a dozen anecdotes of the young lawyers round about the country, with most of whom he had had sharp passes of wit, and in all cases, according to his own phrase and showing, had “come down uppermost.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “If you look in the maps of the 'orld, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth; it is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river; but 'tis all one, 'tis so like as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both.” Shakspeare—Fluellen. The landlady spread her little board, on which a broiled chicken and sundry smoking slices of ham soon made their appearance. Chubby biscuits of fresh Pittsburgh flour, formed a pyramidal centre in the table arrangements, and a capacious bowl of milk stood beside them. Coffee, which is the sine qua non in a western supper, was of course not lacking; and appetite, that commends even the unflavoured pulse and the dry roots, rendered necessary no idle solicitings to persuade our young traveller to do justice to a meal, in preparing which, the good hostess had spared nothing of her store. “Fall to, Harry Vernon, and don't wait on me,” was the frank command of Horsey, as, grunting and growling the while, he worked his rocking chair, foot by foot, up to the side of the table, and drew from it one of the plates into his lap. Vernon had his good word for the hostess, and in a little time proved himself to be in possession of the best wisdom of the traveller, whom experience teaches, that good humour and a cheerful spirit are the most valuable stores which he can take with him in a course of western travel. We recommend them to all your ill-favoured bookworms who carry their stilts with them into our swamps and forests, and fancy all the while that they can see any thing, who never cease looking on their own pedestals. Vernon had been already something of a wayfarer. Necessities of one sort or another, had schooled him into a knowledge of men of every sort, and it was a rational boast which he was sometimes wont to make, in the glow of a youthful and pardonable vanity, that he could go from Tampa bay to the Rocky mountains, and win good usage and a smile with his supper every night. Such a brag may be made by few with safety. Invidious comparisons constantly rise to our minds as we think of the little and peculiar luxuries of our homes, and we lose our appetite for that which is before us, by suffering our feeble fancies to trouble us with the memories of what we cannot have. Your Englishman is a traveller of this sort. From the first jump which he makes from Dover, or Liverpool, he begins to smell out novelties which are always offensive to self-conceit, simply because they are novelties. His sole business from that moment, seems to be to discover in what things his present differs from his past, and to find fault and grumble accordingly. He turns up his nose with such an inveterate effort from the beginning, that it remains in that inodorous position for ever after. But we have nothing now to do with him. Vernon, as we have said, was of very different temper; lively, bold, frank, generous, he was just the sort of person to commend himself to the southern and western people. His dignity never apprehensive of doubt and denial, was never on the watch to take offence at every thing in the least degree equivocal. To avoid controversy, to avoid the crowd, to yield gracefully in argument, and to forbear pressing his advantage at the proper moment—were some few of the maxims by which, avoiding every prospect of offence, he gained the most substantial victories, as well over the hearts as the understandings of those with whom he contended. Fluent in speech, with a memory abounding in illustration and anecdote, a fancy lively and playful, an imagination vigorous and bold, the profession which it seems he had chosen, appeared to be that in which, above all others, he promised most to excel. Such, we may add, was the opinion of his friends, and such, were it proper for the narrator to predict, was the appropriate event after the lapse of that usual period of probation, to which it is natural and well that all ambitious minds should be subjected. Precocious greatness is generally very short-lived. There was that superiority in the mind of Harry Vernon, which never suffered him to think himself above the occasion. He could descend from the abstract to the practical with an ease and rapidity at once singular and successful. To rise from the actual to the abstract is a far easier matter, and hence it is that we have so many theoretical men, who always fail in the attempt to carry out their own principles. To accommodate himself to the understandings of those he addressed without degrading his own, was another of those advantages— the result of actual experience in the busy world, which, added to the store of our young traveller, and supplied to him as it was supplied to others, in many instances, the lack of money and the aid of powerful friends. Before supper was fairly ended he had shown some of these possessions, and Horsey, the rough, garrulous, grumbling invalid, was not unwilling to hear another voice than his own occupy those intervals in the progress of the meal, which he had seldom failed to fill up hitherto from his own resources, and to his own perfect satisfaction. The youth requited him with story for story, joke for joke, and when, at the usual hour for retiring in the country, where folks are very apt to go to bed with the fowls, the worthy dame intimated to Vernon that his bed was ready whenever he wished “to lie down;” her spouse blazed out like a splinter of fat lightwood— bade her be gone and not send the young man to bed at dark, to tumble about half the night in sleeplessness and stupor. “That's the way, Harry; and by the Lord Harry, it's a monstrous vexing way, my wife has got. She goes to bed at dark, you see; she's kept up a little longer to-night than's customary with her; and before day-peep she's a-stirring, and a-tossing, and a-calling up the niggers. Now, you see, I can't sleep soon o' nights for the life of me. I never could ever since I was a lad driving my pack-horses over the mountains. 'Twas then I got a sort o' habit of sitting up late. When we'd come to a running water, or a spring, or some such fine place for a camp, why we'd drive stakes, cut bushes, make tents, and fasten our horses. Then we'd feed 'em, git up a fire, and set to preparing our own feed. Well, we'd have to do all this mighty slyly, I tell you, for fear of the Indians. We'd git away from the main track, hide our horses pretty deep in the small woods, and put our fire in a sort of hollow, so that nobody could see the blaze. Then we'd git round it, put down a hoe and a griddle, bake the biscuit and broil the venison. Ah! Vernon, it was mighty sweet eating in that fashion. There's no meal I ever ate that come up to them. And as we'd eat, we'd talk about what happened to this one, and what happened to that; and how many scares and dangers we'd had; and then we'd steal off, taking turns at that business, to look after the horses, and up and down the road, to see all was right. And so we'd pass the night, Mr. Vernon; and in the morning, betimes, we'd brush up and gear the animals, and put on our packs, and be ready for a start by dawn; and many's the time, Vernon, my boy, in them days, that I've taken `Sweetlips,' that ugly long-shanked rifle you see there in the corner, and dropped a turkey from his roost in the tree jist over the horses, so fat that his breast-bone split open by the time he thumped the ground. Ah! them days, Mr. Vernon, them blessed days, with all their troubles, and all their dangers, I'd give all I'm worth, or ever hope to be worth, if they only were to go over again. But it's no use pining for what can't be got. We can't always be young, Mr. Vernon, and if we could, pack-horses are gone out of use, and there's no Indians to make us lie snug and suspicious, telling stories that helped to frighten us the more. The Choctaws will soon be gone, and the Cherokees and Creeks, I s'pose, though they're something farther off, and I don't know so much about them. You can tell though, Mr. Vernon, seeing you're jist from Mobile.” Horsey, with an inevitable tendency, had recurred to his old practice. The youth replied good humoredly,— “I haven't seen Mobile for months, Mr. Horsey; but you forget, it is my turn to question now, and lest you should start off, and throw me out again, I will begin at once. Have you had many visiters in Raymond—many strangers, I mean, until this time, within the last two weeks?” “Psha, Harry Vernon, say what you want in plain terms. Is it a man, or a woman, you're in chase of? It's a man, I reckon; for Ben Carter a'n't the chap to encourage young lawyers to be running about the country after women. Am I right in my guess, Vernon?” “Suppose I tell you, then, a woman?” “Well, I've nothing to say; but I hardly think it. Are you sure it's a woman, now?” “Nay, there's no certainty about it. A small man, in woman's clothes, might very easily pass himself off for one,” said Vernon, with an air of musing. “Yes, nothing very strange in that, if he had to make a run for it, and had hope of outdoing his enemy's head sooner than his heels. Your chap has no such hope, I reckon, Mr. Vernon.” “It may be not; but man or woman, Mr. Horsey, have you had any strangers in the village lately?” “Well, I'm the very last person in Raymond to see strangers, unless they come to me. I ha'n't walked out of the house for the last five weeks, and jist make out to hobble up to bed, when it's time to lie down. There's my wife, now,—she can tell you more than I. She sees every thing and every body, I think, that comes into the village; I don't know but she sees whoever goes out of it. She's a most curious woman,—my wife—likes to pry into every body's business, and know all about them, but she means no harm; good woman—she's fast asleep now.” A hearty laugh of Vernon followed these praises of the wife, which she was no longer in a condition to hear; and drawing nigher to his companion, he renewed his inquiries, though with a slight change of topic. “Your wounded limb disables you from seeing much of the world at present, Mr. Horsey, but it has not always disabled you, and there are some parts of it which I know you have seen, about which I would like to obtain some information—the `Choctaw purchase,' for example.” “How do you know I've been in the `nation?”' demanded Horsey, with some gravity. “You told me so, yourself.” “The d—l I did! Can it be possible! Well, it is strange how difficult it is, when a man's growing old, for him to keep his own secrets. Out he pops with every thing he knows, and with the help of a long tongue, he will empty the longest head. Are you sure I told you I had been in the `nation,' Mr. Vernon?” “I think so, sir.” “You are not certain, then. It is very probable you are mistaken, sir. I should wish to think so, for I look upon it as one of the last signs of dotage when a man can't keep his secrets.” “But this is no secret, surely. Can there be any harm in stating so simple a fact,” demanded the youth, with curiosity mingled with amusement to discover in a man of so much good practical sense, an apprehension so ridiculous. “So simple a fact has hung a man before to-day, as your law books should have told you. Not that I fear to be hung for any thing I've done, whether among Creeks, Cherokees, or Choctaws. I've had something to do with all of them in my time, and can show some marks of my acquaintance with the red rascals; but then there's no sort of need to tell every thing a man knows, even when it does him no harm to tell it, and when a man's brains become like a bottle of sassafras beer, ready to boil over when a little warm, I think he may as well cast up his accounts, and get his coffin made. But, sir, I have been in the `purchase' and maybe can tell you what you want to know.” “To what portions do the people go who settle there now? Which are the portions most in demand?” “Oh, there's a sprinkling of our people every where, VOL. I. 4 there's no stopping them when they begin. When you think you've got to the end of the settlements, there's still some further on; and the business of the squatter always carries him over the line of the old settlements. But the quiet folks that have got something to go upon and something to lose, they stick a little behind. It does seem to me, that, if it's them you're asking for, you'll find a smart chance of them between the Yazoo and the Big Black, mostly along the edges of the Big Black, and not often west of the Yazoo. A heap of little towns are growing up along the Black. I could name to you a dozen, but it's no more use naming little towns than little chickens, there's so many of them, and they all look so much alike.” “And the gamblers, Mr. Horsey, where do they keep?” “Nowhere in particular, and that's the same as saying every where. But—I needn't ask you, seeing you're Ben Carter's friend—I was going to say I hope you wasn't looking after company among them.” “No, no; but are they numerous?” demanded the youth with interest. “As peas in a fair season.” “They are audacious, too?” “D—d infernal impudent, if you let them. If you go up in those parts it's my advice to you to keep finger on trigger and use your pistol at a word. It's a'most always the quickest hand that gets off with fewest scratches, and to stand palavering with a scoundrel, that you know to be a scoundrel, about what's right, and what's not right, is, to my way of thinking, little better than begging an ass not to kick you, while you make a slow journey under his heels.” “But you're not always sure that it is a scoundrel—” “Sure as a gun; there's no chance of a mistake if you keep your senses about you. But that's the trouble. It's how to keep your senses about you, Harry Vernon, that's the greatest question. Now, I'm clear to say, that it's only by getting drunk, being put in a passion, or having soft soap poured down their backs, that men lose their senses, and afterward lose every thing beside. If they wouldn't listen to smooth words from every stranger they meet; if they wouldn't stop to hug the whisky bottle, instead of taking a quiet kiss and walking on; if they wouldn't get into a passion about every fool speech they hear, then I'm clear, they'd never get cheated out of their money, and knocked on the head, like a blind puppy in a dark night. Now, Harry, you see the danger before you. So long as a man keeps his senses, there's not so many dangers in life, and they may be all got over by a quick head and bold heart. But it won't do to believe in sweet-spoken strangers, and it won't do to quarrel about a fool jest, and it won't do to get drunk. I wouldn't advise a lad to go up into the Yazoo, now, while its unsettled, as I may say, and none but scatterers about; but if you must go, mind your own business, make no more friends than you can help, and keep sober as a judge. Come, sir, you've been talking long enough, let's have a toddy.” “Thank you—no more, Mr. Horsey; and let me correct your errors as we proceed. It is you and not I, who have been doing the talking for the last half hour; and to say truth, I am so well pleased with your eloquence, that I'm for having more of it.” “No gammon, my lad, none of that. But I'm willing to tell you all I know, so long as you don't ask for it all. What's next.” “What officers of the law may be found in those parts, in the event of my being in want of them?” “Lord keep you from law officers in your own case, my lad, though as a lawyer, it's like enough, you'll be making them toil hard enough in the business of other people. But what makes you think of them—do you calculate on any trouble?” “Nay, that matters not, my friend. Should I have any trouble, which a man of the world, who lives in the world, must always look for, I should like to know in how much I may depend upon the countenance and protection of the law in the places to which I'm going.” “Depend upon a hickory sapling and your own teeth rather. Depend upon steel and bullet, Harry Vernon, when you're on the Yazoo. What the d—l would a man expect to find, out, away on the very skirts, as I may call it, of civilization? Would you have gentlemen and Christians in a part of the world where there's no timber cut, no lands cleared, no houses built, nothing done, but what's done by the squatters and that sort of people? No, no: your only chance is a keen eye, a quick hand, and a steady head. Trust to these in the Yazoo; there are few better friends any where.” “The counsel of one who has certainly done more by their help than most men;” responded Vernon, with a compliment that was not displeasing to the veteran, and showed a degree of intimacy with his history on the part of his guest, which proved him to have been no inattentive auditor of himself and of his friend Carter;—“but,” continued the youth, “what can you tell me of the `Braxley settlement.”' “Not a syllable—I know nothing good of it, however; though I couldn't say, more than from general report, any thing bad agin it.” “What of `Ford's camp?”' “Nothing.” “Georgeville?” “That's sprung up into a village since my day. I believe it's a poor affair:—but two or three stores or thereabouts. I never saw the place but once, and then there was but one; I didn't stay in that longer than to take a sup of whisky. If there's nothing better in it than the whisky, don't go there. It's a place to shun, Mr. Vernon.” “What of Lexington?” “Don't know the place.” “Squab Meadow?” “Never heard of it.” “There's a little village called Lucchesa, that lies somewhere upon Green Briar Creek in Carroll County. Do you know any thing about that? it's a new village.” “New to me, yet I think I have heard the name; there are several little villages grown up since I've been in those parts, and, for that matter, they grow up every day. I know the country well enough, but, bless your soul, Mr. Harry Vernon, it's no sign of ignorance in Massissippi, not to know the towns by their names. We can't find names for half of 'em.” This was said with some signs of impatience, and the youth, though still seemingly desirous of pressing for information which was yet desirable to obtain, was compelled to rest contented with the imperfect statistics already gleaned, which, perhaps, no continued examination of the old man would have rendered more complete. “I am afraid I have wearied and worried you, Mr. Horsey, without much help to myself. What I get from you is to the full as satisfactory as the comparisons of that categorical personage, Captain Fluellen; `There is,' says he, `a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth,' &amp;c.” The youth gave in full the passage which has been 4* prefixed as an epigraph to this idle chapter, and which we care not to repeat again. Portions of the quotation, however, and the authority referred to, seemed to disquiet our landlord. “Fluellen,” said he; “where was he captain? There's Captain Fenelon, I know, that heads the `Buck Swamp Rangers,' and that's the nearest name to it, I can think of. I know Fenelon, and a mighty clever fellow he is; a little too fond of the girls perhaps; but that only hurts himself. It isn't him, you mean.” “No, no—Fluellen is a captain far more famous, I think, than Fenelon will ever become. He is one of the honoured names of Shakspeare—the world renowned—” “That d—d player-man!” cried the impatient landlord, interrupting the eulogy which our hero had begun, of the merits of the divine bard. “Look you, Mr. Vernon, if you want that we should keep friends, and part friends, say no more of that player-fellow and his cursed books; don't I beg you.” The youth was silent from wonder for a few moments, to behold such an earnest countenance as the speaker wore while he uttered this serious remonstrance. When he recovered breath, it was to expostulate. “In the name of wonder, and all the wonders, Mr. Horsey, but how is this? How is it that you are so hostile to a writer whom all the world joins to honour and applaud?” “The world, Mr. Vernon, may honour as it pleases, and it frequently gives honour where very little is due. But it's the honour which the world gives to this same player-fellow, which has done more to make me an unhappy man, than any thing in the world beside.” The wonder of the youth increased, and a single word conveyed his farther interrogation: “How?” “I have a son, Mr. Vernon; you haven't seen him in my house; nor, till this minute, have you heard his name from my lips; nor, perhaps, from the lips of Ben Carter, though you may have got a good deal out of him. Well, sir, this son of mine, got in with some of these player-fellows at Mobile or Orleans, and they carried him to their blasted stage-houses, where he got possession of these Shakspeare books, and he's never been worth a picayune since that day. He took up with the stage-fellows, got to making a d—d fool of himself before the Mobile people, and had the impudence to send me a paper, a printed paper with a great heading, and his name among the rest to play some pieces out of Shakspeare. Sure enough, that very time my neighbour here, Major Mandrake, that keeps one of the taverns, being down on a visit to Mobile, saw Tom Horsey, with his own eyes, come out in front of the whole people, with a gold crown upon his head, and covered with spangles, and dressed up, in a most ridiculous way beside, jist for another chap, who come out afterwards, to stick him with a sword. And there he rolled about over the floor, until he died, and the people shouted and clapped their hands, as if he had done some great thing, and it was jist that d—d stupid shouting and clapping, that led the fellow to make such a bloody fool of himself. But mind you, I don't mean to say that he died in airnest —it was all pretence—all make b'lieve; but, by the Eternal, Mr. Vernon, I'd rather a thousand times he had died in raal airnest in a fair fight, than to have fallen into such a folly, and brought disgrace upon his family.” A playful commentary upon this speech rose to the lips of Vernon, as the old man concluded; but the youth saw that the grief was too serious and sacred, to suffer any light or irreverential remark. He contented himself with inquiring into the fate of a lad in whom he began to take some interest, the rather, perhaps, because he saw the matter in a less severe light than the father, and possibly because he thought that the backwoods boy, wanting in all the advantages of education and city life, who could relish Shakspeare to so great a degree, must be of something more than ordinary metal. “And where is your son now, Mr. Horsey?” “The saints know best, Mr. Vernon. Tom Horsey has not darkened these doors since March gone was a year.” “But you hear from him?” “Ay, sir, and of him. I hear from him when he wants money, and of him when he has it. He makes me hear when he's out, and makes every body else hear when his pockets are full. The misfortune is, that this Shakspeare fellow never comes alone. He brings with him late hours and strong drink, and damned bad company, Mr. Vernon; and what with him and them, Tom Horsey is in the broad road to destruction.” “But do you provide him with money when he demands it for such indulgences.” “Fill your glass, Vernon; let us drink, and say no more. I'm a surly, crabbed sort of creature; they will all tell you so; and yet, they all wonder, and I wonder at it myself, that I have so little strength to do the things that I resolve upon. The boy's my only boy, bad as he is, Harry Vernon; and he gets more money from me than I ought to give him. But, what's that? Did you hear nothing, Mr. Vernon?—no voices—none—just below the window?” The old man trembled with sudden agitation, while bending forward to listen, as indistinct accents fell upon his own and the ears of his guest. In another instant, the room rang with a loud burst of declamation from without, in which Vernon detected some lines from the bard whom the old man had so terribly denounced, but which now seemed to awaken in his mind any other than hostile feelings. Meanwhile the voice proceeded, and the passages spoken seemed not inappropriate; and, perhaps, were chosen from their partial fitness, to those relations between father and son, which had formed the subject of the previous conversation. The passage was from the speech of Bolingbroke, third scene, fifth act of Richard the Second. “Can no man tell of my unthrifty son? 'Tis full three months since I did see him last: If any plague hang over us, 'tis he. I would to heaven, my lords, he might be found; Enquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, For there, they say, he daily doth frequent, With unrestrained, loose companions,” &amp;c. The eye of the father caught the glance of his guest earnestly fixed upon him, and in that instant he recovered his composure. “Now, out upon the scrub! he comes at last, with his player-verses in his mouth—” “Ay; but how truly do they suit, Mr. Horsey!” was the reply of Vernon. “Yes, indeed, well enough; but will they cure the mischief that they tell of? No, sir; this graceless rascal thinks it handsome to swagger with a belly full of whisky, and a brain full of Shakspeare, at the lowest tavern in the city of New Orleans. By the Lord Harry, but he comes not in my door!” A loud knocking from without answered this resolve; and, following the glance of the father's eye, Vernon rose quietly and opened the door to the son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “This fellow I remember Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son; 'Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well; I have forgot your name; but sure that part Was aptly fitted, and naturally performed.” Shakspeare. The prodigal waited for no invitation to enter, but bounced in, the moment the door was opened. Seeing the stranger, he stopped short for an instant, his deportment bearing equal marks of confident assurance, and a reasonable consciousness of his own demerits. The habits of the player-men, however, got the better of his misgivings, and, without yielding any farther notice to Vernon, after the first glance, he advanced towards the father, prefacing his movement with a hearty rowdy salutation, which made the old man wince in his seat, at the gross disregard of his dignity which it betrayed. “Ha, dad! there you are, prime and hearty, as though you never had a son, to `bring you cares for inconsiderate youth,'—and how's the old lady, `our venerable mother, keeps she well?' gone to bed, I reckon, and fast; so I take it for granted she's as she should be, and you, sir, you and—” Here his eyes wandered to the seat which Vernon had re-occupied. “Puppy!” exclaimed the father, “can't you leave off your cursed player nonsense, Tom Horsey, when you're in a gentleman's presence. That, sir, is my friend, Mr. Vernon, Mr. Harry Vernon, of Natchez, or New Orleans, or elsewhere.” “Sir, Mr. Vernon, of elsewhere, I am glad to know you. `If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth,”' was the prompt address of the actor, extending his right hand, with an air of princely condescension. “Monmouth, no!” cried the more literal father; “Vernon, I said, Tom Horsey,—Mr. Harry Vernon.” “The same—a good name, I think, sir, a very good name, and I'm glad to know you. Mr. Vernon, as I said before, `there's matter in this;' and, some allowances must be made for the prejudices of age, and a hard school, sir, against the drama. It is only in the presence of gentlemen, sir,”—to his father,—“let me tell you, that players should speak. The very element they live in, sir, is in the applause of the gentle and the wise—their pursuits are `caviare to the general;' and let me tell you, sir, that you risk not a little when you give way to this harsh and most unjust manner of speech, in respect to a profession, whose ill report while you live, it is said, will do you more harm, than a bad epitaph when you die. You will find the passage in Hamlet,—for the rest, sir—have you any thing to drink.” This speech was pretty evenly divided between the father and his guest. When it was concluded, he turned to the little table that stood between the elder Horsey and Vernon, filled a glass for himself, and drawing a chair from the corner of the apartment, placed himself, with a show of sang froid, which was not altogether felt, directly beside the father. The old man could no longer restrain his indignation. “You d—d conceited squab, where have you been these eight months? Put down your glass, sir, until you answer me.” “Dry throats must needs make short speeches, sir —I have been at school.” “Do not mock me, Tom Horsey!—don't go too far, boy, in playing your d—d theatre stuff on me. I can't bear it much longer—you'll put me in a rousing passion.” “We'll have a rouse to-night, sir,—Mr. Vernon, `the king drinks to Hamlet.' Don't think, sir,” addressing his father, “don't think I shall forget you` dad, but your glass remains unfilled. Shall I help you?” “Help yourself and be d—d. Answer my question. Where have you been these eight months?” “Egad, sir, that's the most puzzling of all questions, and the most correct answer that I can make you is that which I have made already. At school, sir! In the great school of the world, sir, I have been acquiring my humanities or getting rid of them. Don't you think me reasonably improved?” “What have you done with the money I sent you?” “Paid my schooling with it, sir.” “That is to say, you drank it out at taverns upon your roaring companions, your drunken actors, your bully gamblers, and all that strange sort of cattle that you herd with in Orleans.” “Alas! my father, revile not thus. Wherefore will you speak of things which you know not. Have more charity, I pray you. As for the poor sums of money which you sent me, they were as nothing to the good which they procured me. They brought me to a knowledge of the fine generous spirits, who are as much above the dirty wants and slavish necessities of common clay, as the divine Shakspeare is beyond all the thousand priests and pretenders that officiate at the altar of the muse. Had you sent me ten times the sums you speak of, I had freely shared them all with the noble fellows whom your parsimony has chiefly compelled me to leave.” “Ay, and where would their generosity have carried you, you ridiculous spendthrift. To the Calaboose—to the Calaboose, you rascal. If it has not already carried you there. Pitiful sums indeed!—but you shan't impose on Mr. Vernon. You shall say what these pitiful sums are; you shall tell him what money I sent you, and let him say whether I have not been almost as great a spendthrift as yourself.” “No doubt, no doubt—I make no question, dad, but that your extravagance has always exceeded mine. I am but a chip—a small chip of the old block; and—” “Why, you impudent rascal, my spendings have been altogether on you. If I have to reproach myself with any extravagance at all, it is only in having given you the means to make a fool of yourself.” “`Wisely, indeed, and worthily bestowed'—you do not repent, sir, of having provided for my subsistence?” “I have done more, sir. What amount did I send you by Bill Perkins?” “Some fifty or a hundred dollars, as I think.” “As you think! as you think! Tom Horsey, will you lie too? Have your player-fellows taught you this among their other accursed lessons. Speak, are you in earnest!” The old man's voice trembled, and passion seemed to be succeeded in his choking utterance by a fear that falsehood was to be included among the other profligacies of one whom his own tenderness had rendered somewhat incorrigible. Vernon watched the scene with curious interest, and he remarked the sudden flush which mounted up into the son's cheeks at the accusation, as if conscious innocence revolted within him at the injustice. Such was the impression VOL. I. 5 of the spectator, and it was confirmed by the effect which it seemed to produce in the youth's tone and general manner. “You are a little too hard with me, sir,” was his reply. “I admit that you sent me some money by Perkins.” “Three hundred, not fifty, sir—not fifty or a hundred, but three hundred dollars, Tom Horsey.” “Right, sir; Perkins brought me that sum, which I trust you did not really think me base enough to deny. When I said less I simply meant to compute it by the time it lasted. It was the very sum you name, sir, but it might just as well have been the fifty—it was very short-lived.” “Very well, sir,” said the father, glad to have an excuse to forbear reproach and harsh language. “And had it been fifty times as much, do you think it would have lasted much longer with such company as you keep? No, sir, they would have spent my gains and your gettings, and counted my thousands as you have learned to do by fifties and hundreds. But that's not all. You got money from my factor in Orleans. What sum got you, for to this day I have never learned.” “I sent you two thousand dollars by Major Mandrake.” “I got it, but the crop sold for more, sir—cotton was selling at sixteen; I had the price current of the week, and have it now. What did my cotton bring? You sent me the money but no account of sales, what was done with that?” “'Gad, sir, I know not, unless we used it to make snow one night at C—dwell's when the storm gave out. I remember, we were rather short of snow.” “Tom, Tom, don't rouse me, don't put me in a passion. I'm sick,—I can't bear it easily; and besides, I don't want Mr. Harry Vernon to see what a d—d fool I am to let you treat me as you do. What did you get from my factor in all? let me know that. You sent me two thousand—what did you keep?” “Well, sir, as nearly as I can remember, about seven hundred—” “Seven hundred!' “There may have been a forty or fifty tacked on to it; but it certainly was not more than that. Suppose we call it seven hundred and fifty dollars—`the very head and front of my offending, hath this extent, no more.”' “And enough too, in God's name, to ruin any man that's got so little to go upon as I,” responded the father; “but there is more, Tom Horsey—you took a hundred and seventy dollars with you when you went; you collected ninety dollars from Michael Hopper for so many bushels of corn; and what have you done with Martin Groning's note for sixty-seven dollars. If you got that, it makes—” “But I haven't got that, dad. Groning's a great rascal; `there must be lawings ere you get that gold'—we shall have to set Master Phang upon him, dad, before he settles.” “No, let him go. It's but a poor sixty-seven dollars, and I shouldn't miss so small a matter, if my own son didn't help me to the loss of a great deal more. But now count up, count up, Mr. Vernon, these moneys as I call them out to you, and then say whether I'm parsimonious, or whether there's a spendthrift in my family, that'll let out at a thousand mouths what his father was compelled to take in at one.” “Nay, don't count up, I beg you, dad,” cried the profligate; “why will you bother Harry Monmouth with these `small chores.' To count up money that you have not, is to impoverish memory most cursedly. The very thought of my spendings is a misery, since it only the more forcibly reminds me of the little that is left to spend. Wherefore have I left my company, `my comates in exile,' but that the candle was at the last snuff—wherefore have I trudged homewards `on weary legs—”' “You don't mean to say that you walked from Orleans here, Tom Horsey?” cried the father, to whom the last fragment of a quotation uttered by his son suggested a new cause of apprehension. “Not all the way. I had a cast in a steamboat as far as Monticello, and a fling in a wagon for some twelve or fourteen miles above; but, by the Lord Harry, the widow's mare did the rest.” “Why, where's your horse?” “Gone—gone the way of all flesh.” “Dead—how was that—the botts?” “Ay, botts enough to take off a dozen horses. The sheriff suspected I was out of money, and not able to keep him any longer; and so relieved me of the charge.” “Seized for debt!” exclaimed the father aghast; “a colt of my own raising—seized for debt!—eat his head off in a livery stable!—ah, Tom, Tom! you'll kill me yet!” “At the suit of one Stubbs, a tailor; a fellow that helped me to fit up my wardrobe, and brought suit for all his suits. Thus was I nonsuited. But I punished the scoundrel, you may be sure. I basted him with his own yard-stick the night I left Orleans, till there wasn't a seam in his carcass that couldn't count stitches. You shall hear particulars some day, Mr. Monmouth; a devilish good story— but—” “Look you, Tom, this gentleman's name is Vernon, and not Monmouth. None of your tricks, I tell you.” “Vernon, is it? I ask pardon, but I thought it was Monmouth—Harry Monmouth—it was Harry you said—I'll swear to that.” “You've a free tongue to swear, Tom Horsey; but how would you like an oath of mine to cut you off with a shilling, and leave you to the miserable life you have so miserably begun. Answer me that, sir: what would you think of such an oath? and wouldn't it be justly deserved, Mr. Vernon?” “Nay, father, do not bother Mr. Vernon any more in this matter, and above all matters eschew the sin of swearing. Oath taking is a bad business, and unless you take some such rash oath as that you speak of, I think I may promise you with safety to do nothing again rashly as long as I live. I am come home to be a sober fellow, follow the plough, drive the wagon, bleed horses, and kill bacon. In short, do just whatever is needful to make money, and keep it afterwards.” “Can you keep to this?” cried the delighted father, who desired nothing more than such a concession on the part of his son, as should save his dignity, and obviate the necessity of more scolding. “I think so—I'll try, sir.” “Ah, Tom, for awhile only, I'm afraid. You'll be reading in the newspaper about some new play-house or some new actor, and then, nothing will suit, but off you must go to see for yourself; as if the reading of it wouldn't do as well.” “It shall—it shall in future, dad. Don't be afraid of me. I think I shall keep my promises this time, for, do you see, whatever might be my own desires to go to Orleans, the drubbing I gave the tailor, Stubbs, will stand against me in the black books of the law, and I have too great a respect for that stately dwelling, the Calaboose, to risk the chances of admission. As for the theatre itself, by my fears, I have just as little reason to venture near it. My 5* chance is all up with the American, and my hopes with C—dwell; but for that, dad, it might have been, that you hadn't seen me home to-night.” “Well, whatever it was, I'm glad it happened so; but you don't mean, Tom, that you quarrelled with the actors.” “Ay, with the very chief of them—the manager.” “Well, the stars be thanked, I'm a great deal gladder than before. There's no hope of making up the matter, Tom, is there?” “But little, unless you lend your help.” “God forbid! I lend my help!—I'd burn down all their establishments, if I could. But how was it, Tom—what was the quarrel? You didn't lick him, too, as well as the tailor?” “Egad, no! The boot was on t'other leg! It was because I didn't lick him, that we quarrelled; it was, by my soul!” “Come, come, Tom, don't, now; none of your d—d nonsense. We know it's all gammon that! No man would quarrel with another because he didn't lick him.” “True as gospel, dad, professionally speaking. An excellent adventure, by the way, Mr. Vernon, and I must tell it. Dad, fill your glass!—an excellent joke—fill, Mr. Vernon! You shall hear how I came over the manager—how I struck him, even when `soaring in his pride of place.”' “I thought you said you didn't strike him, Tom?” demanded the matter-of-fact father. “You shall hear, sir. Understand, you are at the American Theatre in New Orleans, C—ll, manager; and your humble servant doing third and fourth-rate characters at tenth-rate prices. Ten dollars a week is scarcely enough for gentlemen of my cloth; and just at this time Stubbs was writing to me in the very language of Master Shallow, `I beseech you, Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand,' in other words, of less classical grace, —`let me have but half of my bill.”' “Drop the theatre talk, Tom,” whispered the father; “drop it, d—n you, if you can.” “It was necessary to remit, to raise the wind. This was the difficulty. I had got rid of the seven hundred, and the three hundred, and the other odd hundred; and I had even drawn the week's salary in advance. I had the horse, it is true, but the colt was a favourite—I had helped to raise it; and, by Jupiter, I had much sooner have parted with my velvet plush breeches, than with Corporal.” The old man gave an approbatory chuckle as this show of proper feeling escaped his son in his narrative. “But you should have gone to the factors, or wrote to me for the money, Tom, and redeemed the nag. I'd rather than twice his value that you had not lost him.” The son winked to Vernon, as he replied— “Ah, dad, Stubbs is not the only tailor in Orleans; and one suit is not all that a poor devil actor has to suffer before his wardrobe's complete. As I was saying, I knew of no present mode of raising the wind, and I had but one mode left me. I went to the manager, implored him for a loan, on the strength of future services. He denied me; `but was I to be denied?' You shall hear how I fixed him. That very night I was to play Richmond to his Richard. The manager had a very strange notion that he was a tragedian, and was, therefore, continually going out of his element, to try waters which were quite beyond his depth. He did well enough as a genteel comedian, but that did not satisfy his ambition; and among those who knew nothing better, he did monstrous well. I remember the first time I ever saw him was in tragedy. I went to Orleans, dad, if you remember, with uncle Wat Stevens, and he treated me to the show.” “Damn him for it,” was the fervent ejaculation of the father. The son proceeded without heeding the interruption. “Like the rest of the gaping countrymen around, and the house was full of them, I thought him a wonderful man, though I soon learned other things when I looked a little more into the matter. But the opinion of the manager himself underwent no change. He was still ripe for tragedy and nothing else, and was that very night, when Stubbs sent me his impudent letter, to play Richard—I, Richmond. We went through the piece very well, till we got to the death scene. Then Richard tried his best, and I buckled to him. I had wounded him, and he had fallen; but that was nothing to a man determined to outdo Kean, and make the ghost of Garrick gape with astonishment, and shiver in his shroud. He rolled and writhed about the stage, keeping up the fight as he did so, and striving to show his skill of fence while in the death agony. It was then that the thought seized suddenly upon me to avail myself of the particular predicament in which he stood—lay rather—to bring him to an accommodation—to compel him to my own terms. What do you think I did, Harry Monmouth—Master Vernon, I mean—how do you think I fixed him? A thousand to one you can neither of you guess.” Vernon confessed his inability, and the father, now an attentive auditor, and a pleased one too, as he beheld the evident attention of his guest, and observed the more modest demeanour of his son, disclaimed with equal readiness any ability to conjecture the ruse de guerre made use of by the debtor to extort from the dying actor, the loan he found necessary to keep him from his tailor's clutches. “I knew it—I knew it was beyond you both,” was the chuckling response of Richmond to these admissions. “It was a thought of my own, and my own only; and what was it, you will ask. Hark ye then in your ears; it was simply to forbear killing him. I began to play slowly to evade his strokes and avoid pursuit of him. You may imagine the predicament of Richard, half-dead, and inviting the fatal blow. He called to me in a hoarse whisper, while twisting and writhing after, and sticking at moments, when, in order to keep up appearances with the audience, I suffered our swords to mingle. —`Why the devil don't you play, Horsey?”' “I answered him in a suppressed voice, speaking in the gorge of my throat, so that he could distinctly hear the emphasis which I employed, and supposed that it could not altogether escape the hearing of the audience. Yet, such was not the case. It is an art of speech which I possess, and of which, Mr. Vernon, you shall have a sample some day. “`Look you, Richard,' said I, `it was only to-day I asked you for a matter of seventy dollars to pay off a d—d tailor that was troubling me. You refused me, was that done like Richard?' “`Strike on, you d—d fool,' said he, `or I'll strike you off. What are you talking about? Strike!' “`Never till you consent to let me have the money. You sha'n't die by my hands to-night, Richard. I'll leave you half-dead upon the stage, and for once there shall be no catastrophe. Will you let me have the money?' “`Yes, yes, any thing,' was his answer; `but strike on, the pit is getting impatient. Strike! strike!' “We tugged away quite heartily then for a few seconds, the house roared with applause, and some of the groundlings, after he had received the coup de grace, actually encored the performance, clearly signifying a desire that he should do the death over again. But, would you think it, the ungrateful tyrant refused to let me have the money the next morning, and added to the enormity of his conduct by giving me my walking ticket. Was it not shocking, Mr. Vernon? Did I not merit the money for the humour of the thing? But he had no soul to feel it—none, none!” Before Vernon or the father could answer the question, or comment upon the transaction, another person entered the apartment and interrupted the dialogue. The introduction to the new-comer must be reserved for another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “It tastes Of rank injustice, and some other end Time will discover; and yet our grace is bound To hear his accusation confirm'd, Or hunt this spotted panther to his ruin.” Shirley. The new-comer was one of whom the reader has already heard. The quick eye of Vernon distinguished his friend at a glance, nor was that of the other less observant. The warmth of their embrace, when they met, spoke for a deep mutual regard between the two, not only superior to that which belongs to ordinary friendships, but something more than could be expected to appear in the case of persons so unequal in years. Mr. Carter could not have been less than forty-five; a tall, well made man, with a fine, full, but dark countenance; an eye, black and lively, but of benevolent expression; and a look of amenity and kindness which denoted a degree of soberness and subdued thought, in which the buoyant spirits of the youth of twenty-five, could scarcely find much that was congenial. Vernon could not have been much more than twenty-five; his temperament was evidently lively, if not rash; and good humour and a playful spirit, seemed to predominate in his disposition. The gravity, the almost sadness, of Carter's countenance, was unreflected in his own; and yet, it may be added, the sympathy was quite as close between them, as could be hoped for under any circumstances; and whatever might be the difference of their moods and wishes, under the influence of unequal ages, there was none of that exacting severity, on the part of Carter, or of that distaste to discipline, on the side of Vernon, which might endanger the relation. If Carter was grave, even to melancholy, he was, at the same time, benign and indulgent. He could make allowance for the impatience of youth, esteeming it, perhaps, a fault that was not without its virtues, in a country which calls more imperatively for boldness and adventure, than any other more sober qualities. If he smiled at the follies of youth, it was the smile of indulgence, or, at most, of pity, and not the ascetic grin of scorn and male-volence. Vernon, on the other hand, warm, impetuous, and lively, never once forgot the superior years of his patron—for such was Carter—nor suffered his veneration to undergo diminution, because the latter sometimes encouraged him by the familiar freedoms of the companion. The utmost confidence prevailed between them, the result, possibly, of a mutual and perfect knowledge of their several claims and character. The observation of Carter had taught him that his protegé was a man of the strictest honour, the nicest sensibility, the most fearless courage, and the finest talent. Vernon was no less assured of the high virtues of one who had been to him a protecting and wisely indulgent parent, in the place of all others, from his very first moment of reflecting consciousness, to that in which they meet the reader. The entrance of Carter was the signal for the flight of the soi-disant actor. His genius quailed before the eye of the new-comer, in whom he recognized a well known monitor, who did not spare his rebuke, and whose influence upon the father, had tended in no small degree to restrain his eccentricities, by diminishing the money, which the old man was but too ready to yield to his requisitions. Still, the deportment of Carter was kind and gentle to him, as to all the rest, and as it was, habitually, to every body. His salutation differed not from his wont, when he shook his hand, and bade him welcome home, after so long an absence. But this forbearance in no wise encouraged the erring Master Tom. From a dashing, nonchalant personage, he became suddenly subdued to the awkward country lout, only anxious to know how best to effect his escape without challenging attention to his movements. This he was soon enabled to do, when he found the regards of Carter chiefly bestowed upon the youth, and his shoulder turned upon himself. He stole away, and was followed after a little while, by old Horsey, whom a sturdy negro assisted to his chamber. It was there that he again found Young Hopeful, and renewed the various dialogue, a sufficient sample of which the reader has already had. We will not distress him by a repetition of the dramatic slang, with which Tom replied to, and annoyed his father; whose chief objection to the quotations, lay, perhaps, in the difficulty which he found to comprehend them. Our present purpose carries us back to the apartment which we left. There, the two, apparently resuming a subject already partially considered, were earnestly engaged in the adjustment of topics, the business of which will form no small portion of the ensuing narration. It may serve us, therefore, who design to trace its progress to the end, to give some heed to a conference which will, perhaps, the better enable us to understand some of its objects, and of the histories of those who are most conspicuous in its details. “You are resolved then, my son; you know all VOL. I. 6 the adventure—its troubles, its dangers and the numberless difficulties that surround it. These, you see, at least, if nothing beside; and with a perfect knowledge of these, and with the farther prospect of incurring these risks and difficulties without effecting your purpose, you freely and voluntarily determine upon the journey?” “Freely, willingly, my dear sir, and with a satisfaction, not easily expressed, that I find you willing to confide to me a charge of such importance,” was the unhesitating reply of the youth. The other squeezed his hand in silence for a few moments ere he resumed. “Perhaps, Harry, since such is your resolution, it is due to you that I should unfold myself a little more. Your confidence in me deserves it, and were it not so, the confidence which I have in you leaves me without fear that I incur a risk in giving you my nearest secrets. From this I can suffer no harm, now, not even in feeling, by its revelation. But a few months, nay, a few weeks ago, it had been otherwise. I am now free to relieve myself from the accumulating pressure of a grief—a grief of youth, that I have learned to silence, if not subdue, —but which at length breaks from all restraints when I am no longer young. You have seen this man?” “I have, sir.” “Ay, but not to know him. He is my senior by five years, but he was my associate—my friend— when we were both young. Boyish friendships are of little value at any time, and in most cases they are of evil consequence. The name is perverted, the tie is not an enduring one, and, even if other harm does not come of it, the effect is evil in teaching us lessons of distrust, when genuine worth implores our confidence, and true friendship might be had by kindred worth. But I will deal in facts and not in maxims. William Maitland was my habitual associate from boyhood. We came to Mississippi together, and for several years I had no reason to regret my confidence in him. We lived together harmoniously, sought the same sports together, made the same journeys in company, and took pleasure in the same society. My labours grew prosperous, however, and his did not. This made him discontented. He left me and went down to Orleans, where he invested his capital in trade. Two years elapsed before I again saw him. I had in the meantime become acquainted with the family of Col. Ralph Taylor, of Pearl River. He was a worthy old gentleman, but the chief attraction of his household in my eye, was his youngest daughter Ellen. I loved her, Harry, with all the ardour of a heart as purely unselfish in its pursuit as belongs to mortal; but I told her not my love. I feared to do it, as I saw nothing in her deportment which, to my watchful eyes, held forth any encouragement to my hopes. Perhaps it was, that, with all the doubts and timidity of a true affection, estimating its own claims at the humblest rate, as sincere affection is most always apt to do, I shrunk from pressing upon her those regards which I felt, and occasioned a kindred doubt in her mind of my real purposes. I had reason to think afterwards that I deceived myself—that she really loved me—that— but this is needless. Enough, that at this moment I received a visit from Maitland. He came to borrow money, and finding me not at home, and his wants being pressing, he followed me to the residence of Col. Taylor. There he saw Ellen; and, to shorten a story already quite too long, there he won her. But not at this first visit. He came back with me to my residence, which was then at Woodville, and procured the money which he required. But while with me, he artfully procured from me all necessary information with regard to the Taylor family—its character, connexions and resources. I did not reveal to him my feeling for Ellen, but he must have seen it. A short time after this, while on a visit to Natchez, I was seized with the yellow fever, which nearly brought me to the grave. For days I remained without consciousness of what was going on around me; for weeks without strength to leave my chamber. In this time Maitland prosecuted opportunities which I had seemed to neglect. He pressed his pretensions upon Ellen, and in a moment of wilfulness of heart, such as seizes upon the best of us at times, she accepted him. I had reason to know afterwards that she had not been insensible to my attentions, and that she was taught to believe that I had trifled with her. William Maitland knew of my illness all the while, but studiously withheld the utterance of what he knew. The first knowledge I had of my loss was the notice of their marriage in one of the Orleans papers, to which city he removed her a short time after the event. Since then I have but once seen her, and then—” Carter paused in his narrative as if struggling with the climax of those emotions with which he had evidently striven earnestly, for some time before. He rose from his chair and paced the room a while, the eyes of Vernon in the meantime being fixed upon the fireplace. “I had thought myself too old and too strong for these weaknesses, Harry, but the affections which grow up in solitude seldom become obtuse. Were I a citizen, now, I could deliver you this narrative with a smile; but, as I am, I almost regret that I have begun it.” “Do not, then, pursue it, sir, I beg you,—at least not on my account,” said Vernon. “Nay, nay, Harry, it is begun, and the beginning is half the battle always. I must now finish it, or never. I trust, having opened my bosom to you, to be better able to preserve silence on this subject for ever after. The affair staggered me in regard to Maitland's sincerity and faith. I was puzzled to determine upon his conduct; and my chief suspicions arose, not so much from his having married, as from the studious secrecy which he had observed towards me on the subject. I got no letter from him; I heard of no inquiry or invitation—nothing, indeed, of him or of his business, until he had removed her to Orleans. He had need of me again. He became the candidate for an office of great trust, and applied to me to be his surety. It was then that I saw Ellen Taylor for the first, and, I may almost say, the last time, as the wife of another. She is in her grave now; but it will not disparage her memory, with you, my son, when I tell you, that it was from her but half conscious lips, that I was taught to believe that I might have been the happy possessor of her hand, as, to the last, I was the possessor of her heart. Do not attach blame to the pure spirit of her from whom this confession came. It was while her mind wandered in the delirium from which she never recovered, that her sweet lips told me this blessed truth. I kissed them, Harry, in a fond requital, when the angel had left the tenement in which it had been so troubled! I kissed them, Harry, when, colder than the marble which was so soon to cover her, I well knew that there was no danger that his lips would remove the sad and sacred seal which mine had set upon them!” The struggling tear of Harry Vernon soon followed that of his patron. His silence was the best show of sympathy that his good sense suffered him to make. The other after a brief pause proceeded. 6* “The surety I then gave is the cause of our trouble now, as you may readily suppose. But for her, Harry, I had not given him my name, for I had sufficient reason then to distrust him; and, but for her— but that I still loved, rashly enough for any sacrifice —I had not been guilty of the greater folly of persuading our friend Gamage to a similar risk. The defalcation of Maitland will nearly ruin Gamage as well as myself. But this I cannot suffer. As it was because of my entreaties that he consented to sign Maitland's bond with me, I must save him harmless as far as I can. To this point then, your commission extends. Let Maitland give up the money which he is known to have taken from the Bank, and we will pledge ourselves not to prosecute, and I will secure to his children,—he has but two—the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, in any form of investment which he may prescribe, so that it be under any disposal but his own. Nor shall he be left otherwise unconsidered in the matter. I will give him my bond, stipulating the annual payment while he lives of three hundred and fifty dollars, being a sum quite sufficient for his wants in that privacy to which he must, for his own and the sake of his children, for ever after confine himself. He will see from this, if he be not besotted and ripe for destruction, that I have no disposition to pursue him with malice. But my forbearance is no tribute to my regard for him, any more than to his worth. But he is the father of her children, and I would wish to save them from that shame and sorrow which justice might, without compunction, freely visit upon him. You now understand, precisely, the relation between us, and will thus be better able to exercise that discretionary power in any arrangement you may think advisable to make, which you could not so well have done without this knowledge. I am guilty of no ill-advised or idle flattery, my dear Harry, when I declare my perfect willingness to rely upon your judgment and to abide by any course which you may resolve upon. I have found you always worthy; I doubt not that your ability will keep pace with your worth. But you have no easy task, and your hope of success will depend very much upon your being unknown to Maitland. But for the risk of spoiling all, you should not go alone upon this mission, nor, perhaps, should you have gone at all. My appearance would alarm his fears and prompt his flight, and indeed, the appearance of any stranger will have a tendency to awaken his fears and compel his caution. He, no doubt, wherever he may be, will have his creatures on the watch, and be himself watchful. Your genius must contrive its own modes for disarming his fears, and appearing in his neighbourhood as an ordinary character. I can give you but little counsel that is not general. One rule is a good one always among strangers in our country, and that is to “be secret, yet have no secrets.” Utter yourself without reserve, yet say nothing which had better be reserved. Have no mysteries to your neighbour, though every thought be hidden. This is enough, your own reflection must do the rest. I have wearied out your patience, Harry, but I have now finished.” “You spoke, sir, of his connexion with gamblers: Is this certain?” “Yes; he is known to have lost a part of the property which came by his wife at faro in Orleans. He is also known to have frequented places of habitual resort by the blacklegs of that city. What connexion he may have with them now, is simply conjectural, but there is great reason to fear that his separation from them will never be complete while he lives. He had a passion for play which has probably grown upon him, and which will no doubt lose him his ill-gotten spoils, unless he is very closely and suddenly pressed for them.” “May he not have lost these moneys already, sir, —may not his defalcation and flight have resulted from his losses.” “I hope not, and think not, for we happen to know that the particular parcels of gold and paper which he took, were in the Bank up to within three hours of his flight.” “That may be, sir, yet he may have appointed the sums taken, for the payment of previous losses.” “This is probable in part. I make no doubt that he was compelled to appropriate in this manner, but it seems scarcely probable that he would have fore-borne supplying himself with the means of future indulgence or support. That he did not appear at the tables after the robbery, we know from those whom the Bank set as spies upon them. Suppose, however, that ten thousand dollars be already gone, which will be a liberal allowance, we can afford that,—we must, indeed, and something more,—but let us struggle for the rest. I make no secret to you, Harry, of the fact that my own responsibilities to the Bank, and the resolve which I have taken that Gamage shall go harmless, will leave me destitute, —utterly destitute,—unless we recover something of this loss.” “My efforts shall not be wanting,” was the simple assurance of the youth; “you have provided the necessary papers, sir?” “I will do so, and expect the other documents from Orleans, by Friday next. You will be compelled to defer your departure until then. Meanwhile, it may be well if you attend upon the court. It will help to conceal your present object,—which it is important that you should conceal here as elsewhere,— if you should appear like the rest of your profession seeking its usual opportunities. I doubt whether you'll get business, but that lack is too general among beginners to occasion wonder; and it will be quite enough to show that you want, and would not refuse it, if it were to offer. But let us take a breathing spell—you have ridden well to-day, and so have I. A good night's sleep will freshen our minds, and probably help us to new ideas. You saw the youth,— the son of Mr. Horsey,—had he been long before me?” “An hour, perhaps—not more.” “A thoughtless, improvident lad, with some capacity, but little ballast. With his own turn of mind, and his father's indulgence, he will come to nothing. Caught young, and in other hands, he would have done well. It is too late now. I need not counsel you to say nothing that he should not hear; but, keep your papers close; make no memorandums that he may read. He is honest, I believe, but has a prying, curious disposition, as much the result of an idle, restless mood, as of any thing else. Let him not feed it at our expense, when a little timely prudence may save us any risk. And now to bed, Harry, as Master Tom would phrase it, with what appetite we may.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “Clack. —But are there players among the apprehended?“Scentwell. —Yes, sir, and they were contriving to act a play among themselves just as we surprised them, and spoil'd their sport.“Clack. —Players! I'll pay them above all the rest.” Richard Broome, 1632. —The Merry Beggars. When Harry Vernon entered the hall the next morning, the first person he met was Master Thomas Horsey, who encountered him, selon des règles, in the most approved fashion of the theatrical world, with a fitting quotation, to provide himself with which, he had, no doubt, groped half the night through his pocket Shakspeare. “ `My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul!' I've been waiting for you, sir, with the impatience of a thirsty throat, to which any thing like delay in the antifogmatic, is almost certain bronchitis. Here, sir, is garden mint—fresh, sir—I pulled it myself; or, if you prefer the animal julep, here is an egg—I did not lay it myself, but will warrant it quite as fresh as the mint. The whiskey is at your elbow, the peach at mine, and the sooner we fall to, the better. `A good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it.' Which take you?—none!” Horsey put down his own glass in wonder. The idea of refusing a morning dram had never entered his brain. “You are not serious, Mr. Vernon?—you will surely take one or t'other—the peach brandy?” “Neither, Mr. Horsey. You must excuse me; it is not a habit with me to drink in the morning.” “It is not, eh? Well, I'm sorry—sorry for your sake not less than my own. The habit were not a bad one, Mr. Vernon, nevertheless; and I commend you to better examples in this particular than it has been your fortune to fall upon. I drink, sir, to our better acquaintance. I should have relished much to have had some conversation with you last night, but that `learned Theban,' Master Benjamin Carter, making his appearance, sent me off in a jiffy, and dammed up my ideas quite as effectually as if he had run the great raft of the Mississippi-bend into my brain. He's a sober old boy, that, Harry Monmouth—likes not my merriment—`he loves no plays,' and still less players, `and smiles in such a sort.' I tell you what, Master Vernon, though no man can think of Ben Carter more worthily than I do, yet, by the faith that is within me, I fear him, something—that is `I rather tell thee what is to be feared than what I fear.' He hath ever been a sort of curb upon me; he sees through my follies, when dad is about to reward them as virtues; and the tricks which would triumph over every body else, he seems to unravel as easily, and trace home to the true author as certainly, as if he had a gift of divining. He's a relation of yours, Master Vernon?” “No, sir—none—an acquaintance of my father and friend of the family.” “You're from below?—left the old people?— 'Egad I had almost asked if you had not left them with light heels and lighter heart. I've been so much used to doing that sort of business myself, that the suspicion was natural enough, though, seeing you with Ben Carter, such a conjecture would have been very foolish. You're a lawyer? Come to plead at Raymond?—got any business to go upon yet?” &amp;c. Young Horsey resembled his father in one respect: he had all his curiosity. We have thrown into the compass of one paragraph the hundred questions which he contrived to ask before the rest of the family made their appearance. In the sight of Carter his ardour was something restrained, though, in the mild, benignant countenance of the latter, one would seek in vain for that sign of power to which the young actor ascribed so much potency. He finished his breakfast before the rest, and, as he left the room, catching the eye of Vernon, he put on the aspect and manner of an awkward clown, terrified at finding himself in so solemn presence, and striving to leave it with as little noise as necessary, by moving on tip-toe and backward to the entrance. Once there, he bounded from the steps, and by a single agile movement was in the middle of the road. The next moment he might be heard, spouting a favourite passage at the very top of his voice. “If Tom would only leave off that d—d player-book,” began the father apologetically to Carter. “It is a folly that will do no harm, my good friend, unless you stimulate it by harsh usage. The book is innocent enough—it is not that, but the love of praise, which turns your son's head. Listen to his speeches patiently, and he will think you the best audience he ever had; and if you can sometimes contrive to clap your hands together in this manner when he has concluded his speech—” “As they do at the theatre-houses?” demanded the father with some eagerness. “Ay—even so.” “Well, Carter, what then—what'll be the good of it?” “I think it not unlikely he will be content to stay at home with you and mind his business.” “But he promises to do so now, Ben Carter. He says he's done with Orleans and the play-houses. He has good reason for it, I can tell you. He's grazed upon the sheriff at Orleans, and had a queer bout with the head man of the theatre. He told us all about it last night—I didn't quite see into the fun of the thing, but Tom says it was deused funny, and Mr. Vernon was mightily tickled at the story. I think there is a change in Tom, and as he promises so fair—” “Don't rely too much upon his promises. He cannot so soon break away from his old habits, and must be allowed some little farther swing before he dismisses his levities sufficiently to suffer him to come home and go to work. Only do not by unnecessary harshness drive him into them. Notice his follies as little as may be, and tolerate his speeches even where you do not exactly understand them. The scorn of a father, not unfrequently drives a son to defiance; when some little indulgence to his idle tastes, might leave him free to see into their absurdities himself. Let me warn you, however, to give him as little money as possible. He wants but little in the country, and where he asks for much, it is a sure sign of profligacy. Do not expect to see him sober on a sudden. I would rather he should not become so. I should suspect him of a worse offence still, than any you have against him—hypocrisy. The best sign in his favour, since his return, is that he still continues his spouting, knowing your hostility to the practice—though it may prove him wanting in proper reverence, it saves him at least from the suspicion of disingenuousness. Give him employment as soon as you can, and let time do the rest. A sudden change is seldom to be relied on; and a transition VOL. I. 7 from one extreme to another, is almost always the practice of a rogue.” “But Tom is honest—Tom's no rogue, Ben Carter.” “I believe it, Horsey. Do you take care that you do not make him one. It is not uncommon for you to denounce him as a rogue—to call him rascal and scoundrel, and such abusive names as these. To give him the rogue's reputation, is to take from him one of the great inducements to be an honest man. Beware that you do not this.” Meanwhile, the subject of this discussion was pursuing his walk, with all the heedlessness of a wayward mind, through all the nooks and crannies of the village. He was busy seeking out old haunts and old associates. Tom Horsey was popular with every body in Raymond but his father. His pompous declamations, his noisy humour, the readiness with which he joined in a joke, and the steadfastness with which he pursued it, commended him naturally to all the younger portions of the community; and now that he re-appeared among them, there were salutations on every hand. Smiles and pleasant speeches, that inflated the vain heart of the youth to the utmost, encountered him at every corner, and he swaggered along the main street with the air of one conscious that his movements were witnessed by an audience far more indulgent than ever Richmond found at Orleans, even when he bestrid the tyrant, and commanded his own terms from the prostrate and ungenerous manager. There was a miserable little rookery that stood at the western entrance of the village, where a still more miserable sort of business was carried on by a man named Hawkins. This man was an idle, worthless creature, and his obvious pursuits were supposed by many persons to be only a sort of cover for other objects which were, possibly, far more profitable, though not so legitimate. In his shop might be seen a barrel of whisky, a kitt of tobacco, a few knives, pipes, candles, and 'coon-skins; seldom any thing more; but there were shed-rooms to his dwelling, and upper chambers, which were asserted to be very well fitted up, in which no limited profits were made out of the ignorant and the unwary. Public justice had her eye upon this establishment, but, up to the present time, nothing had transpired of sufficient importance to justify her in setting her hands upon the lintel. The proprietor kept a closer watch upon her movements, than her emissaries maintained over his; and whatever might have been the suspicions of the neighbours, Hawkins met them with a bold front, and challenged their inquiries. To this house the actor drew nigh. His approach was watched by the proprietor and another man, who stood with him at the entrance. “Here is the very chap himself,” said Hawkins. “This is the younger Horsey—the crazy actor—who run away to Orleans, and paid the manager, it is said, for permission to appear and spend his father's picayunes as fast as they are made. Yet the old fool dotes upon him, and will leave himself bare to give the youngster his buff breeches. By a little management we may get out of him all that we want to know, or, at least, all that he is able to tell. He is vain of his abilities as an actor, and by feeding his swallow, we may easily pick his teeth.” “Is it he that struts so?” demanded the other. “The same. This stranger Vernon, lodges with his father. It is known that he inquired for Carter on his first arrival, and received directions to the house of Horsey.” “And what can this silly fellow know? If he be the man you speak him, would they be fools enough to trust him with any of their secrets?” “Scarcely—I do not hope for that. But Tom Horsey is one of those restless, fidgetty sort of persons, who are continually meddling with the affairs of other people. He will glean from his father all that he knows of Carter and Vernon, and if they are not exceedingly sly, he will see into their concerns as far as themselves.” “It can do no harm to sound him. He draws nigh.” Hawkins advanced from the doorway, and addressed the actor in a fashion of his own. “ `Horatio, or I do mistake myself.' ” “ `The same,' Mr. Hawkins, `and your good servant ever.' How does the world use you—still in the old stand, I see.” “Ay, Tom, and at a stand. But where have you been this year of Sundays. I haven't seen you `since the gander's neck was last soaped.' ” “ `No more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me,' ” was the reply, followed by a hearty laugh from both, as the phrase, which may seem somewhat mysterious to any but southern readers, reminded them of one of those practical jokes, in which it was Tom Horsey's misfortune too frequently to indulge. “No more of that, Hawkins, I pray you—let that story be forgotten.” “Forgotten, indeed!—impossible; the story's quite too good, and I must tell it to my friend here, Saxon, Mr. Thomas Horsey, Tom, my friend Ellis Saxon, a gentleman from the Yazoo—a glorious fellow like yourself, loves a joke from the bottom of his heart, and will die some day in a frolic—” “In a ditch!” cried Horsey, concluding the sentence. “Pardon me, Mr. Saxon, the prediction is just as like and more like to fall upon me than upon you; and it's an old rhyme of a song that the Western boys sing when they're boating down to Orleans;” and he repeated the lines that follow: “Though we be not wise or rich, Yet what matter—touch the snag,— We can frolic in a ditch.” “A good song—I've heard it a hundred times, though not lately. The boatmen are done up now. These steam-sturgeons have cut up as pretty a branch of business as ever needed a long pole, and deserved a glorious frolic. But what of that, Tom Horsey? Is there to be no pleasure in the world because we can get to Orleans now in ten days in place of forty? If the steam-sturgeon does up the `broad horn,' there's a long horn that raises the steam. Come in, my son, and take a sup of whisky while I tell Saxon about the goose's neck.” “No, no, Hawkins, let that dog sleep. I'll come in and join you with the whisky, but no scratching old sores, say I.” “What, you're not afraid of consequences now— don't you know the old Squire's done up—gone to his long nap. He'll never trouble you about it, sonny.” “No matter, I've sworn off from these tricks, Bill Hawkins!—I've promised the old man to put on a straight coat, crop my hair and go to meeting o' Sundays—” “And be at all the love-feasts!—what of all that, Tom?—do you think to keep your neighbour from being happy because you have grown sour. `Because thou art virtuous, shall there be no more cakes and ale?' Come in, thou reluctant saint, who would put on two faces of tragedy and comedy at the same time— come in, and Saxon will tell you of a splendid blowout on the Georgiana steamboat, going up the river last month. They had a play on board, Tom Horsey—an amateur play—and played Julius Cæsar to more than four hundred persons, the part of Brutus by an old friend, Hugh Peters, the limping schoolmaster at Clinton.” 7* “Hugh Peters play Brutus—the impudent pedagogue! You don't say so, Mr. Saxon, do tell me all the particulars. Hugh Peters, indeed! What could have put it into the leatherhead to think that he could play Brutus?” “What, but hearing us spout the dialogue at school,—`That you have wronged me,' &amp;c. But come in—the water's on the fire, and the whisky on the stand.” The news of the amateur performance was quite enough for the mercurial Horsey. His good resolutions were forgotten in an instant, and in two minutes more he was sitting between Hawkins and Saxon, in a little cupboard-like apartment, back of the house, a kettle upon the fire, glasses upon the table, and every thing in preparation for one of those regular rounds to which the young actor was already but too much accustomed. “These steamboats have their advantages after all; and so, Mr. Saxon, the chaps on board the Georgiana got up a tolerable piece of work, did they?” “Ay, on the upper deck, Mr. Horsey; and considering the short preparation they had, the thing was really well done. There was one chap, an actor from Orleans, named Tilton—” “Tilton, I know him—a mere candle-snuffer— what the d—l did he pretend to do?” demanded Horsey, interrupting the speaker. “He played Cæsar—played the ghost rather, and did it so well, that he scared the women half to death. His face was so pale—I can't conceive how he could have brought himself to so death-like a complexion.” “Psha, sir, the easiest thing in the world—a little chalk or magnesia does it,—and as for the whiskers, the mustache, the imperial, and such small matters, they lie, sir, at the end of a burnt cork, and may be had at a moment's warning.” “Ah, indeed!” was the response of Mr. Saxon, made with the utmost seeming simplicity. The conceited Thespian continued: “These are the arts, sir, of the actor; and, though not absolutely essential to the artist, yet you cannot conceive how much they help the imagination of the spectator; in the arousing of which lies, probably, the great secret of the good dramatist and perfect actor; but what you tell me of `Little Bowlegs'—so we used to call Hugh Peters,—`Ye gods it doth amaze me!' to think that he should presume to play at all, and then to play Brutus—'twas a test part— a fellow that talks through his nose, and swings his arms about like a windmill;—that walks, for all the world, like a strutting gobler, and has a face like a squash. Ha! ha! it must have been very ridiculous, Mr. Saxon.” “Not at all,” was the reply. “We were all too dull, and wanting something to enliven us, the thing did well enough; and there were some present, who thought Cæsar was done quite as well as C—well himself could have done it.” “C—well be d—d!” was the irreverent response of Horsey to this opinion. “Pardon me, Mr. Saxon; I mean no offence, but it agitates my bile, when I hear C—well spoken of in tragedy. I should think better of Herr Cline, the rope dancer. `I'm a soused gurnet,' sir, if C—well is any thing but a comedian,—a devilish clever comedian, who spoils himself by attempting any thing else; and as for these folks in the steamboat, being pleased with such performers as Tilton and `Little Bowlegs,' they must have been most cursedly tired of the boat, or must have had the smallest possible particle of good taste and good sense among them. `Brutus, Hugh Peters,' `Julius Cæsar, Jim Tilton,'— candle-snuffers in extraordinary for the American Theatre—it's very ridiculous. Hawkins—trouble you for that spoon and the sugar.” A quiet smile of contempt played over the cold, dark features of Saxon, as he saw the importance which the youth annexed to the matter, and beheld the swelling indignation with which he spoke of the despised amateurs. As if disposed to humour the folly and conceit of the youth, he continued the topic. “But are you not exceedingly aristocratic in your notions, Mr. Horsey? Because a man has been forced to snuff candles, does it follow that he is incapable of something better?” “Surely not, sir, surely not. The fates forbid that I should deal in such a pernicious doctrine. What was Shakspeare himself, my masters;—his early career is enough, without other authority, to prevent me from such sheer folly of opinion; but Tilton is no Shakspeare, nor no Garrick; and how ever he may have played the ghost of Cæsar, I tell you, he will be nothing but a miserable candle-snuffer all his life. Look you, I reason thus, Mr. Saxon. I have seen our friend Hawkins jump for a wager, and know his best pitch to a feather's width. Shall I not be able to say, thus far can Bill Hawkins jump, and no farther? Even thus do I tell you that Tilton was born to be a candle-snuffer, and nothing better—unless it be a call-boy on the stage.” “Yet was it said,” remarked Saxon quietly, “that he was going to open the theatres at Vicksburg and Natchez.” “ `Gods, grant us patience!'—but it is scarce possible!” “I heard as much myself,” was the confirmatory statement of Hawkins. “The d—d fool!—He's mad—utterly mad. On the word of a gentleman, Mr. Saxon, this fellow has no sort of rank—no reputation—no ability. Were I a manager, he should have no employment at my hands. The fellow is perfectly incapable.” “He is going to have a roaring company, nevertheless,” said Hawkins. “He's engaged Peters for third-rate characters, and is getting up recruits from every quarter.” “`I shall forget myself!' Was there ever such an insolent pretender!” The amateur was almost furious. The moment had arrived when he could be best practised upon; and the game was continued. “They say he has taken up actors even here in Raymond. Was not this young fellow Vernon, one of his men?” was the inquiry of Saxon, urged with a manner of the most perfect indifference. “Yes, I think that was the name. He came into town last night,” replied Hawkins. “Who? what? Harry—Harry Vernon! Psha, Hawkins, I know all about that. He's none of them —he's no actor—nothing but a lawyer riding the circuit. He's a sort of relation of sour Ben,—so we call Ben Carter—and I 'spose the old boy's got him some cases. He stayed with us last night, and I took a julep with him this morning. Told me all about it himself.” “Indeed! He's a relation of Carter, and no actor, then?” demanded Saxon. “No!—he's no actor—has no notion of it. As for his being a relation of sour Ben, I don't know whether I'm right to say that—indeed, for that matter, I think he told me he was not,—only an acquaintance. No, he's no actor, I assure you; and if all your information about Tilton and Bowlegs be no better founded than this, I wouldn't give much for the new theatre.” “You may be deceived even in this, Mr. Horsey,” said Saxon. “This young man Vernon, they say, is going up into the Yazoo. Did he tell you that?” “Lord, no! There's no truth in it, I'm certain, and sour Ben is too strict a chap to be very close with an actor. If he only once dreamed that Harry Vernon had such a notion, he'd throw up his hand in a minute. I know sour Ben too well: he'd cut loose from the young 'un, and leave him just rope enough to hang himself.” “What you say rather strengthens the report. If Vernon knows this of Carter, as without doubt he does, would not this be reason enough why he should keep his secret while under the old man's eye, particularly, if he has any favour to look for at Carter's hands, as it is said he has. Now, they do say, and I may as well tell you, I heard it from Tilton himself on board the Georgiana, that Vernon was engaged secretly to play first characters.” “The devil, you say—first characters!” was the exclamation of the astounded amateur. “Who could have believed it—the fellow was so sly.—But I needn't wonder at that. Egad, I played a sly game at first with Ben Carter myself. But, Harry Monmouth—well, to confess a truth, the chap played the sly one cleverly, if what you tell me be indeed the truth. But I am not certain yet.” “Look into it,” said Hawkins carelessly; “and so sure am I that Saxon has good authority for what he says, I'll go a quart, and a dozen cabanas upon it.” “Soh! it's a bet,” replied the amateur. “Our hands upon it, Trojan, and it will be a close tongue that can keep my worm from getting under it. I'll through Harry Monmouth's knapsack before he takes his crumbs out, or may I never look down upon the footlights again. Mr. Saxon,”—drinking—“the stage, sir, though it be carried in a steamboat.” “Very good—devilish good, Tom,” cried Hawkins, apparently delighted with the modest play upon words which the actor had attempted. “You were always clever at these things, but your frolic seems to have freshened and improved you. But what did the old man say, Tom, when you came back? The story was that you had made his factor hand over to the tune of three or four thousand dollars, which you lost at faro in one night.” “Not so bad as that, Hawkins, though bad enough still. I have worried the old man something too much, but I have promised him reformation, and—” “Will keep your promise, if you can.” “Well said, Hawkins,” responded the youth with a sigh; “if I can. The task is a very difficult one; for this d—d stuff you've been telling me of Tilton and his floating theatre, has put me in a most inconceivable state of combustion. I should think well of the plan, if that wool-headed candle-snuffer had nothing to do with it. In good hands a theatre at Natchez—” “Under the hill,” said Hawkins with a sneer. “No, no! there's too much hell broth there; the gruel is slab, but not good enough in that quarter, unless in playing Tom and Jerry, to which I do not much incline; but for a respectable establishment, I doubt not that we should be able to keep it up, and put money in our pockets, at least four months in the year. We could then shift our quarters, as the old players did, from one barn to another. We could go to Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Manchester, Port Gibson, and all about, and drive the prettiest and merriest gipsy business one could desire. `By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid!' but it would spoil the best plot, ay, and the best play too, to have such a botch as Tilton in the management.” “Tilton, or no Tilton, Tom, remember the bet. We must satisfy it before this youth, Vernon, leaves Raymond.” “My hand on't. But are you for court now— what's to be done—any murder cases. I like to listen to them; they are so many eggs for tragedy, which unborn Shakspeares may hatch. What say you, men,—go along with me.” “Time enough; the court won't open for an hour, and there are only a few cases of assault and battery; nothing of interest. Stay awhile and sup your whisky, and we'll go with you then. Saxon, your glass waits.” Let us leave the trio for awhile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “See, where he lies, slaughter'd without the camp, And by a simple swain, a mercenary, Who bravely took the combat to himself.” Rob. Greene, 1560. Vernon, meanwhile, accompanied by his friend and patron, proceeded to the court-house, in the area in front of which he encountered the curious gaze of all the natives to whom the face of a stranger is instantly obvious, and in the examination of whom they do not always content themselves with the keen scrutiny of the eye. “Whar' are you from, stranger?” and “whar' are you guine?” and “what's your business here?” and “what do you do there?” are the ordinary questions by which the forest-born contrive to obtain possession of that intelligence for which the Atlantic citizen has his morning gazette. The crowd was fast assembling, and Vernon left alone by Mr. Carter, who was required to attend to some pressing business elsewhere, was, of course, compelled to go through his examination like all the rest, and bore it with the most becoming fortitude and good nature. Not that he answered his inquisitors with a strict regard to the truth; this might have exposed him to defeat in the purposes which he had in view; but with that ready adroitness which is the sign of keen and quick imagination, and which, by the way, is one of the very first requisites in a country circuit lawyer; he answered them in such VOL. I. 8 a way as to reveal nothing, and yet satisfy them that he had nothing more to reveal. When asked about New Orleans, he could tell them a long story about the new big steamboat of which they had heard wonders; and by conversing freely with Tom, Dick and Harry, about matters with which neither himself nor Tom, Dick or Harry had any thing to do, convinced all around that he was no starched, stiff-necked upstart, so solicitous of his own birth, family and fortune, as to dread the effect of their contact upon his nobility. “A 'cute chap,” said one, “that fellow, Vernon; knows all about that Orleans railroad and the big steamboat; says Madame Lalaurie, she that licked her poor niggers to death, and tied 'em week after week without hog or hominy, will get mightily smashed among the Orleans lawyers.” “He's an Orleans lawyer, then?” demanded another.” “I rether reckon so,” was the reply, “though, by the powers, he didn't tell me that.” “Well, but now he's moved into Massissippi, or how could he come to plead here in Raymond.” “That's true—I'll go and ax him where he lives now; I rather like the chap,” was the opinion and resolve of the baffled inquisitor, whom Vernon had contrived to lead from himself by freely enlarging upon other matters, which, for the moment, amply satisfied the hearer's curiosity. But the youth had disappeared from the spot, and was then in the rear of the court-house where he had been called by Carter who held him in close conference. Meanwhile, the court was convened, his honour had taken his seat, and the crowd, hurrying with that strange curiosity which is never so well satisfied as when it hears of the misdeeds of its own nature, and which is never so active and apprehensive as in a secluded country village, soon forgot all concern for the interesting stranger, and gave itself up, soul and body, to the clamours of officers, silencing clamour; the calls of jurymen and witnesses; the small wit of small lawyers, and the sapient wisdom of the judge, whose oracles, generally monosyllabic, are accompanied by a shake of the head, worse-wise than Burleigh's. Carter, having concluded the relation of a matter which belonged to the expedition of his protegé, was about to withdraw with him to the great moral bullring, when one of those little and most amusing incidents took place, which could only take place in a country such as ours, where a bold decisive character is formed by the adventurous life which it makes prominent, if not necessary; and where a free spirit and genuine humour seem absolutely to result from the absence of any of those educational restraints, which, in New England, graduate all intellects to an interesting level, making them as completely the creatures of mould and measure, as if God had decreed them, even in morals and expression, to the exquisite republican equality which they deny to none—who have a money qualification and are not Irish and Catholic. A broad-faced, brown-cheeked, good-humoured looking farmer approached the two, and addressing Carter by name as an old acquaintance, turned from him to his companion, and slapping him upon the shoulder with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance, spoke to him in some such language as the following. “Look ye, now, stranger, they tell me your name's Varnon, and that you're a lawyer, and I reckon it's true what they tell me. You're a friend of his, Ben Carter—eh?” Carter answered by introducing Vernon more formally to the interrogator, whom Vernon himself satisfied on the subject of his other interrogatories. “Well, Harry Varnon,” said the old man in continuation, “I like your face—by the hokey but I do— and without meaning to praise you to your teeth, I tell you you're a d—d smart-looking fellow; and I want to give you some law business to do for me now, before the court's over here in Raymond.” “Your business is his, Mr. Shippen,” said Carter, anticipating the reply of Vernon, “and I think that my friend will do justice to himself and you at the same time.” “Let the boy talk for himself, Carter. I want to hear him talk since I'm going to hire him, you see, to talk for me in the court-house. By his face, he ought to have a mighty free speech, and that's the sort of thing you see that will best suit me at this present. What say you, Harry Varnon, are you willing to argify a little business for me in a mighty bad case.” The other professed his willingness to do what he could for his client to the best of his ability, and in such a style as to satisfy the old man that he was not likely to prove a bungler in his business. “That's your sort,” said he; “and now look ye, Varnon. The law is agin me here for licking a d—d Yankee trader, that said something sassy to my darter Nelly. She's only a child, Master Varnon, a leetle over thirteen years old, and couldn't 'a meant any harm in what she did; and if there was any harm in it, d'ye see, why I was the only one to blame in the matter. I gin her a five dollar bill to go to Watson's store to buy some little truck, and he said the bill was a false one and a counterfeit, and spoke so to the child as if she meant to cheat him—and she a gal too—that I got angry as a buster, and went straight off and mounted him. I pulled him out from his shop, and it wasn't at all gentle, the way I handled him. I made his sides ache, I tell you. Well, the long and short of the business, then, is this: instead of coming out and making it a fight after his own fashion, with any weapons, jist as he might think best for himself, he goes a-lawing me about for damages, and he's put down his bruises and black spots at five thousand dollars; as if his laying up a week, and putting a mush poultice on his shins, and a piece of raw beef to his eyes, should have cost him so much money. Well, you're right to laugh, for that's the true state of the case, and now what do you think you can do with it?” “You have counsel already?” asked Vernon. “Oh, yes; one Graham, here, that comes from Monticello; a mealy-mouthed chap that don't please me at all; but he was the best I could get to do the business when I wanted it. He answered Perkins, who is Watson's lawyer, step by step, in the law-papers he put in; and I s'pose did that part of the business tolerable well; but then, he can't talk, Varnon; and he trembles and looks afeard when the other lawyers talk, and that vexes me, to have a lawyer that's afeard to open his mouth in my business; and I wo'n't have him talk for me if I can help it.” “But, Mr. Shippen, I cannot think to supersede Mr. Graham in this business; it is against the courtesy of the bar.” “There's no superseding at all. Graham's quite willing to get somebody to help him; for, look you, he says that he knows nothing that he can say to help me. He says they'll prove every thing agin me, and there's no sort of defence that he can make. Now, he says, if I had only let Watson give me the first clip, he could defend me very well; but wouldn't 8* I a been a blasted fool to ha' let him, when every body knows that a first clip is half the battle? No, —no! none of that stuff for me; it may be law, but I reckon there's no reason in it—none, that'll sarve a man here in Massissippi.” “I don't know that I can do much more for you than Graham,” said Vernon, modestly; “you, at least know, Mr. Shippen, that the law favours him most who suffers the first injury.” “You can talk, Varnon, and that's something more than Graham can do. You can tell the people what a darned skunk of a fellow that Watson is, to go and scandalize a child—and she a gal too—to call her a cheat and vilify her in front of his shop; and by the Eternal, if that a'n't provocation and injury enough to justify any father for licking the rapscallion that does it, then I don't know any sense in our having laws at all. Well, then, all I want is that you should talk your mind freely to the people about these things. I know well enough, that by the law-books, a man's not to lick his neighbour for bad words, generally speaking; but then, you see, here's a case different. Here the bad words is spoken to a gal child, that has a character to lose, and there's no such thing as standing that; and it does seem to me that it's right to make a monstrous difference between blackguarding a man himself, and blackguarding his darter. Well, Varnon, you're just the man now, to hit the skunk hard on these p'ints. Do you score him now, up and down, hip and thigh, for half an hour—half an hour by the watch—and there's a clear fifty dollars in your pocket. Say the word,—only half an hour now,—I don't want a minute more; and it's a bargain.” Vernon laughed at the humour of the proposition, but seemed disposed to hesitate, when Carter, fearing that some nice point of objection might suggest it. self to the youth, and knowing the importance to his present object of his appearing in Raymond only as a lawyer seeking practice, immediately closed with the offer on the part of the youth. The old farmer, however, was not so well satisfied. “Let Varnon talk for himself, Ben Carter; he's got a tongue of his own, and it does me good to hear him use it. Come, Varnon, my boy, say what you'll do. I've spoken to Graham a'ready, and he says he's willing. It mought be that you think he a'n't; but between us, he's mighty glad to get the trouble on to some other body's shoulders, for he's plainly told me that it's a darned black and blue case, all agin me, and he's no notion of any way to turn it about to my benefit. I'm candid you see—I don't hide nothing from you. I expect to sweat a little at my fingers' ends for this beating, but, by the hokey, five thousand dollars will swallow me and all my substance, and you must rub that down to a mere circumstance. I'm willing to bleed five hundred, but the other is quite too digging. It'll plough me out of the ground to raise it; and root and branch must go along with it. A good talk now, that'll show what a skunk Watson is, and what a shame it would be to let a child,—a gal child too,—be abused by such a varment, and called a cheat, and vilified as if she was a bad woman at the foot of Natchy hill—will help me mightily, and I don't think the jury will mind the law so much, when the reason and the right of the thing is so clearly in my hand. Do your best, my chicken, and the money's in your pocket.” “Did I understand you that Watson made no defence?” “Took his beating like a holy mortyr.” “What! did he not strike a blow?” “Not the breath of one; he jist called upon the people to see how I handled him, jist as if he had a liking for it. That's the worst part of the business for me, so Graham says.” “I'll close with you, Mr. Shippen. I'll plead for half an hour.” “Jist half an hour, Varnon; do it well and stick to him for that time, my chicken, and by the hokey, I don't want a minute more.” “I will do it,” repeated the youth, rather amused with the aspect of the affair, and the requisition of the farmer; and not so hopeless of his cause as Mr. Graham had been. From that very feature, last related in the case, which Graham thought the most unfavourable, the quickwitted Vernon argued the very best results; and having appointed to meet Shippen within the hour, to make the acquaintance of Graham and confer with him on the business so far as it had gone, the stouthearted defendant left him for awhile, as fully satisfied with the proceeding, as if his case was already won. He was one of those worthy republicans who was not unwilling to pay for his liberties; and the right to speak his mind, though it might be only through the lips of another, was one of those rights which he esteemed cheaply paid for with fifty dollars at any time. When he had gone, Carter resumed his conference with Vernon, which related, we need scarcely say, to the projected mission of the latter. Other items of intelligence had reached him,—which furnished additional clues to those already in possession—of the course taken in his flight by the faithless friend and absconding debtor; but as these matters are destined to have their distinct development in the regular progress of the affair, they demand none of our attention now. When Vernon entered the court-house he found his new client awaiting him with the “mealy-mouthed” lawyer Graham. A few moments sufficed to put Vernon in possession of all the facts so far as their litigated character had become apparent to the attorney on record. During the course of his narrative, Graham did not scruple, though in the presence of Shippen, to declare his utter hopelessness of his cause; a sort of sincerity which is of very doubtful propriety, since it never yet discouraged a litigant, and has often ruined a very worthy practitioner. It was amusing enough to Vernon to survey the countenance of Shippen as these opinions fell from the lips of his lawyer.—How he would lift his evebrows, and roll his tongue within his jaws, and then turn away exclaiming— “Never you mind, Charley Graham—never you mind,—there are more eggs to be hatched this week, than was ever laid by your mother's best hen; and some of the chickens, let me tell you, will be long spurred before they chip the shell. Only half an hour, Harry Varnon; only half an hour, my boy; but let it be well talked.” At length, in its due place upon the docket, the long-expected civil case of Watson v. Shippen, sounding in damages for assault and battery, was called, and the several parties responded accordingly. With the first sounds of his name, Shippen perched himself behind Vernon, and renewed his exhortations and his promises. The plaintiff, Watson, was also present—a huge, mammoth-feeding sort of person, half as large again as Shippen, and having the appearance of one, who, if he had not utterly lacked the spirit, could have annihilated, or at least, have swallowed his assailant. His downcast look, halting, hesitating but sly manner, sufficiently denoted the cold, calculating and cowardly wretch—such as Shippen had described him,—who could wantonly insult the young girl, whose indignant father he dared not face, and could not contend with. His attorney, Perkins, opened the case with considerable spirit, passed slightingly over the provocation by which Watson had drawn upon him the wrath of the defendant, and dwelt with proper details of law and fact, upon the enormity of the outrage which the latter had committed; described the cruel manner in which his client had been dragged from his dwelling into the public thoroughfare and beaten by the big-fisted pugilist, whom, in his passionate exaggeration, he made a giant, whilst the plaintiff was diminished to a feeble and delicate person, whose Christian forbearance while receiving the injuries complained of, was the subject of most unbounded, and, it may be added, most unmerited eulogium. After this, it seemed something of an anti-climax to show that a physician's aid was called in to heal his hurts; particularly as the cross-examination determined the extent of this attendance to be little over three days; and the medicaments employed to be of little more cost than “eye of newt and toe of frog.” A peas poultice was shown to be one of the most successful applications of Doctor Shinbone, and the application of the lancet, his most serious operation. With these proofs and the commentary which he made with so much unction upon them, Mr. Attorney Perkins, was willing to close his side of the case. “You see,” said Graham, in a half whisper to Vernon; “it is as I have told you. He has proved every thing, and our case is to be made out of his witnesses only.” The words, spoken however slightly, were audible to the keen ears of the defendant behind, who, smarting with the declamation of Perkins, retorted before Vernon could speak. “And a good case, too, Charley Graham, if a man had it in him to bring out. Up and at him, Harry Varnon, and give him enough of it. By the hokey, Charley Graham, you talk as if your liver was all cream colour.” A sly twinkle of Vernon's eyes was perceptible to the court, as, arising from his seat, he coolly took out his watch, and noted the precise minute before he commenced his operations. The bargain, meanwhile, which Shippen had made with the strange lawyer, to talk for him half an hour only, had got into considerable circulation, chiefly with the assistance of the defendant himself; and the curiosity was general, not less to hear the young and handsome stranger, than to see what he could make of his limits. Vernon did not belie public expectation. Cool in temper, rapid in reflection, and singularly fluent of speech, he commenced his task by reviewing briefly the evidence which had been given. He dwelt with much more emphasis than Perkins on the gross insult which had been offered to a young child, of good parents, and one of a sex, which needed, from the delicacy of its structure, the kindness and indulgence of man; and could not live either in his harshness or disesteem. This harshness, he proceeded to show, was quite hostile to that claim which had been so eloquently made by the opposite counsel, in behalf of the Christian meekness of his client; this meekness being the result of his cowardice, and not his Christianity; since it was very visible in his encounter with the man, and was singularly wanting to his deportment in his interview with the child. “It is very well,” proceeded Vernon, “to insist upon the integrity of the laws, to prevent the brutality of violence, to compel the strong arm to desist from strife, and refer to the authorities assigned by society for such purposes, to redress its wrongs; but there are some cases,” he said, “where outraged humanity becomes a rebel; and when, to wait for the dilatory process of the laws, might be to ruin her for ever. In all cases, where the reputation or the virtue of a woman—a wife, a sister, or a daughter—are at stake, the sudden blow of the outraged relative is a blow struck for virtue herself, and in compliance with laws which are infinitely more sacred than any that can be framed by man. And, so universal,” he continued, “are these laws, that I cannot bring myself to believe that his honour, who now sits upon the bench, and you, gentlemen of the jury, or any man of proper spirit and feeling, could forbear, in like circumstances, to do as my client has done. Ay, gentlemen, even if the place of sanctuary which the ruffian had chosen for his retreat, had been the altar of God itself, rather than the counter behind which he sells his wares, it would not have shielded him from your honest anger, any more than the latter place has protected Watson from the just vengeance of a father. “But I do not rely only on these points, gentlemen of the jury. There are others scarcely less important to be dwelt upon. Watson has come into court clamouring for justice. I should say he has already had it—that never was justice made so clearly manifest as when Shippen punished him for the defamation of his daughter. He founds his claim, as every man must, who comes into court, upon his strict compliance with the laws. But his eloquent counsel has not deemed it sufficient to confine himself to this modest claim. He not only asserts him to have borne the part of a good citizen, but of a most becoming Christian. Look at his meekness under stripes, says Mr. Perkins, and you have the very deportment of the old apostles under like indignities. Gentlemen of the jury, it is a new doctrine to be taught here—this meekness under blows—this calm, Christian toleration of injuries—this patient bending of the shoulders to any assault. But the counsel has himself proved quite too much for his case and client. He has shown you by the evidence that, so far from being meek under his suffering, he, at the very moment, called upon the bystanders to witness—not his courage in resenting injury—the courage of proper manhood, which always forbears insult, and always repels it—but the blows which he submitted to, that they might be counted down and paid for in money. This base creature, gentlemen, this pretended Christian, had no abhorrence of the shame to which he was subjected; had no consciousness of the disgrace and degradation; had, it seems, no actual feeling of the blows, while he consoled himself with the reflection that they were to be paid for; that he should get money for every stroke; that his blood was to be weighed in an opposite scale against five thousand dollars of my client. He comes into court not for justice, but for money. He comes not to sustain the laws, for he himself violated them, when he slandered the innocent daughter of this old man; but to speculate, like a miserable pedler, upon what may be made out of another's violation of them. Does such a man come into court with clean hands? Does he not come into court with the basest of all base feelings in his soul? And would not such a man as this, who thus barters his blood for money as freely as another Judas, barter his very God for a far less sum? I have no sort of doubt of this, myself. I believe, as conscientiously as I do that I now stand before you, that neither your lives nor your honours could be safe in such hands, were it profitable for him to dispose of them, and were the danger not too great for one endowed with such a dastard spirit. Let us go back to that chastisement of which he complains, the dishonour of which he thinks can be all removed by five thousand of my VOL. I. 9 client's dollars; and I, too, will pray you to give as close attention to it, as was prayed for by my worthy and eloquent opponent, though with a far different object. He called upon you to admire the meekness of this new apostle come down upon earth. Your Christian feelings were exhorted to take pattern after this blessed example of Christian forbearance. Behold this lamb under the furious claws of this lion going about seeking what he may devour. See how he prays for his cruel assailant. Such was the picture of my able brother. Let me pray you to give as much heed to one that I shall draw. See, then, this miserable poltroon, submitting to the assaults of one to whom, in physical capacity, he is a giant— hear him how he shouts to the people. He calls upon all around to see that he strikes no blow himself,—he begs them to take particular account of the number that he receives. When jeered by the spectators for such tame and unbecoming submission, he grins, with a miserable delight, even while his foe is kicking him. `Never mind, he shall pay for this,' is the answer that he makes; `for all these kicks I shall have coppers!' His enemy wrings his nose—`Ah!' he cries with a miserable chuckle, `that shall cost him a thousand dollars. Let him kick, he will have to pay for all!' And this, gentlemen, is the sort of person, the Christian, of whom we hear a eulogy that would rank him with any of the apostles that ever was flayed alive in the cause of God and of mankind. To my thinking, so far from calling him a Christian, gentlemen of the jury, I can scarcely count him human. There is so much of cold insensibility about this creature—something so utterly bloodless, yet so malignant, that, were it not at the same time so very base, I should esteem it devilish, and worthy of Lucifer himself. “But, gentlemen of the jury, I am not yet done with this part of my subject. I would like to place before you the evil effect of encouraging a prosecution, such as the present, sounding in individual damages; and the ground which I take for my objection is in the very fact upon which Mr. Perkins rests his strongest argument, namely, the patience with which this creature submitted to be beaten. This very patience under blows, I hold to be disgraceful to the manhood of the person, as it would be to the manhood of the nation that submitted to them tamely; and to pay him for thus submitting, will, gentlemen, be paying a bounty to the rankest cowardice that ever degraded man. Every dollar which you give to this mean creature for this affair, is neither more nor less than a bounty to the coward; the effect of which must be to raise a brood of cowards throughout the country. We want no cowards in this country. Our object should be to discourage them, to withdraw from them the countenance of the courts, and the approval, even indirectly, of all honest men. We punish the coward in the field, yet give a bounty to him in time of peace. What a monstrous contradiction—a contradiction not to be reconciled by any resort to common justice or common sense. Let us punish them alike in every case—refuse them countenance in ordinary life and never trust them in the field. Do not suppose, gentlemen of the jury, that I am disposed by these remarks, to encourage the wrongdoer in his violence, and to drive the weak and unoffending from protection. Had this man, Watson, who is neither weak nor unoffending, made good fight, and been overcome after an honest struggle, by Shippen, I should have been among the first to say that he should have had a few hundred dollars damages; but, under existing circumstances, it is my firm conviction that you will give him only such damages as will carry the costs of prosecution, and dismiss him from the presence of the court with the unmitigated scorn of all who have listened to the dishonouring testimony, which he has this day, in his own case, produced against himself.” The half hour had elapsed, and Vernon sat down amidst a half suppressed murmur of applause. Shippen, as soon as he had touched his seat, jumped up, clapped him upon his shoulder and exclaimed, so as to be heard by all around, “At him ag'in, Harry, only for a quarter more, and you shall have another fifty.” The tears were in the eyes of the old man, and the fervency of his expression, the frank feeling tones of his voice, so opposite as he appeared in every respect to his opponent, Watson, moved the sympathy of the whole court in his favour. But Vernon declined his offer. He felt that he had made the proper impression, and that any thing more would only tend to weaken and impair it. He was one of those fortunate men, of whom there are so few in our hemisphere, whether in the senate, the forum, or the pulpit, who know where to stop; and, though flattered by the obvious effect of his argument, so novel, and in some respects ingenious—of which we have given, however, a very feeble report—he firmly resisted all the persuasions of Shippen to renew the speech. This single fact was not without its effect upon the minds of those present. That a lawyer should refuse a fee for a matter, seemingly, so easy of execution, and that he should resist—a more difficult matter with young lawyers—the temptation still to talk when the auditors were willing to hear—were events to which our south-western people are not habituated. The confidence which his refusal indicated in what had been already said, had its influence also. The jury retired from the box, but before the verdict was returned—which, par parenthese, gave only nominal damages as Vernon had suggested—Carter entered the court room suddenly, and in a whisper summoned the young lawyer away. “The governor is at Mrs. Baxters, and would like to speak with you awhile.” Shippen would have detained him, and released him only with a promise that he should go home and spend a night with him, and see his wife Susan, and Bella, the little girl who had been the innocent cause of the trial, and his ploughing oxen, and a fine blood mare that he had just got from Georgia, and a thousand other matters, most of which, at that moment, Vernon might have had for the asking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9* CHAPTER VII. “I do accuse thee here, To be a man, factious and dangerous, A sower of sedition in the state, A turbulent and discontented spirit, Which I will prove.” B. Jonson—Sejanus. Let us return to the shed room in the shop of Hawkins, where we left our quondam friend the soi-disant actor, carousing with his new companion, Saxon. Hawkins had left the two for awhile, and during his absence employed himself no less busily than did they, and possibly to more useful purpose. The good liquor, aided by the arts of Saxon who had his own policy in it, had been productive of its customary effect upon the erratic youth, who was now plainly in the seventh heaven of theatrical hallucination. He treated his comrade to the choicest selections of the old fathers of dramatic literature, and mouthed in the becoming style of the best modern artists. Now he gave imitations of Kean, practising even the wry twist of his deformed visage —now the lugubrious whinings of Cooper, when declining towards the fifth act; and now the guttural growl of Forrest, when, with singular bad taste, he imitates even the death rattle in the throat of the obese Vitellius. With much talent, and a good deal of taste for the profession to which he so desperately inclined, the want of a proper education in schools furnishing intrinsic standards, left Horsey entirely open to that worst of all misfortunes to talent in any country—and one which is the particular evil in ours—the formation of his style and judgment upon models essentially erratic, and unr gulated by any just principle. To make a point, rather than to act well the part, was too much his desire, as it seems the prevailing ambition with all our Daggerwoods; and in the course of a brief hour, Saxon was helped to a dozen different readings of all the disputed passages in Macbeth, Hamlet, Richard, and the rest. It was curious to see with what industry the youth had accumulated authorities on Shakspeare. He had Gifford, Malone, Steevens, Seymour, Rowe, Farmer, and some thirty or forty more at his finger ends, and could we look at this moment into the little closet which was assigned him as a sleeping room at his father's house, we should see the works of all these persons, accumulated on the table by his couch; he being also one of those erring persons who read by night in bed. These books were all he had left to show for the thousands he had dissipated of his father's income; and whether his outlay had been a profitable one or not, would have been of no difficult decision, were the father chosen to resolve the question. To do the youth justice, however, it may be added, that he had learned something of good from the schools, however erring and even vicious, through which he had gone. A knowledge of books, and even of men, infinitely beyond that usually in the possession of persons in his secluded home, had been the result of his wanderings; and the roughness of the country clown had been fortunately exchanged for a manner, which, though it might be sometimes swaggering and obtrusive, was seldom rude, and never brutal or insolent. As a farther set off to his deficiencies, Tom Horsey was a good natured, generous fellow, who readily forgave injuries, conciliated friends, and took the world always, as the world is required to take its wives, for better or worse. “It's a damned bad world,” Tom was in the habit of saying over his cups, “that would not be content to take him too on the same terms.” He did the world injustice, however, as Saxon strove busily to convince him. The cool, wily outlaw, for such he was, listened patiently to all the youth's recitations, and even encouraged him to continue them by suggesting the quotations, but, at decent intervals he would contrive to insinuate a side question touching other matters and in relation to persons, by which he contrived, in the overflow of the youth's garrulity, to get from him every thing in his knowledge in relation to his father's concerns, and those of Carter his lodger and Vernon his guest. Some particular interest seemed, in his mind, to hang over the probable proceedings of the latter, and all his remarks, even when he spoke of playing —the topic on which Horsey could always be commanded—were calculated to fill the latter with the persuasion that Vernon was about to go up the country. “If he does then, Saxon, by the pipers, I must pay for the music; that is to say, I must treat according to the bet between us—for then, I shall take it for granted it is as you say; and he's going up to join that booby Tilton's company—though he's but a poor codling if he does. That fellow, Tilton, is the merest dolt and dunderhead, if you believe me, that ever bowed to an audience. What the devil can he hope to play himself; and as for his management— management indeed! `A fico for the phrase'—the thing can't answer, Mr. Saxon.” “Perhaps not, Mr. Horsey, yet what is the poor fellow to do? `Young ravens must have food,'—you know the quotation?” “Ay, ay, `mine ancient,' are you there? But let that humour pass! It is my doubt that this chap Tilton is but a crow;—and will never get his corn in this field. If he can, God speed him, I say, and help him to a better mind and finer figure—matters in which he needs all the help that God and man can give him. As for the figure, I would not be his tailor for all the cloth—there would be more cutting to be done on the man than the stuff. What I chafe at is his chance of failure, which is so great,—for failure in a new scheme, throws back the period and the prospect of success; and the thing, which in good hands might, nay must, be successful, would, I am free to take another bet, be sure to fail in his.” “But if he gets good actors to begin with, Mr. Horsey.” “Ay, that alters the case, but when did you ever know a fool choose wise help? It is scarce a thing to be hoped for, however much desired.” “What of this young fellow, Vernon; if he be one of the company?” insinuated Saxon. “You know my thought on that point. Dad says he's a lawyer, and he as good as told me the same thing himself. I'll look into the business when I go home. But, let him be as you think, and still I can say nothing of Tilton's choice. Harry Vernon may be a smart chap enough, and certainly looks like one, but the stage requires something more than that. Is he a reader, say you; has he discretion of points; knows he his author; knows he his audience; and to sum up all in little, has he the divine gift, the born intelligence which makes the actor a born actor, as completely as the poet is a born poet, if one at all? These are the requisites, Master Brook, and a fellow may be smart at law and smart at physic, who would show but a dull ass upon the stage; as I have seen a chap make a fine speech at muster grounds from a stump, who sat a horse like a jackdaw. To speak plainly, though I would not have it reach Harry's ears, my best reason for doubting his being an actor is that I believe he has no turn, no talent for the stage. I like Harry so much already, that I should be sorry to see him fail.” “But why not join Tilton yourself?” “Ah, Saxon, your question takes me all aback. If it were not this d—d fool Tilton, who will spoil every thing, and like others who are as great fools as himself, though probably better actors, he will be casting himself in all the first characters. If I could be sure—” The sentence in which he was probably about to show the weakness of his heart in its yearnings towards the old vanities which he had so recently and solemnly renounced, was cut short by the sudden entrance of Hawkins. “Horsey,” he cried on entrance, “I am afraid we shall lose that bet with you. I have just got away from the court house, where I left your friend Vernon in full argument.” “The devil you did. Said I not, said I not! But what's the business—what's the cases—murder, rape, burglary, battery?” “Battery, battery! He defends old Shippen against Watson, whom he drubbed for insulting little Bella, his daughter. Watson got no more than he deserved, and your man Vernon's serving him like all the world. I think the jury will hardly singe Shippen's skirts, though Watson thought to smoke him to the tune of two or three thousand dollars. Vernon's put a new colour on the colt, and people who thought him rather black when he was first carried into court, now look upon him as a rather pretty cream. He'll get off slick and easy; that Vernon's a smart fellow.” “By the ghost of Cæsar, but I must hear Harry, I must. What say you, Mr. Saxon, will you go along? what say you, Hawkins?” An expressive glance of the eye, which the latter gave to Saxon, led him to decline the invitation, and Hawkins pleading business, the actor set off alone. He had scarcely taken his departure when Hawkins, in a hurried and somewhat agitated manner, taking Saxon farther into the apartment, and closing the inner door, remarked— “Would you believe it, Saxon; the Governor has just got in from below.” “Ah, indeed; he comes alone?” “Yes, and has gone to mother Baxter's. But you take it very coolly. Will you not be off?” “Why should I take it otherwise. I know not that I have any thing to fear from his coming;” was the calm reply. “How! said you not that you knew of advisers having gone to him from Alabama of that d—d ugly business of Grafton; and of your course from the Black Warrior, across to Mississippi.” “Yes! But this is no trouble to me here. These advisers tell of my aiming for the Yazoo, but nothing of my being so low as this. Raymond is the last place where he would think to find me.” “What can he come for then?” “That is a secret I should like to fathom. Can't we contrive it, Hawkins. You have a room at this old woman's?” “Yes: but it's monstrous dangerous. It is risking every thing.” “True; and there are cases where every thing must be risked, if any thing is to be saved; and this is one of them. It is important to know how much of our secret they know. If they have a list of names in Mississippi, the owners of them must take tracks for Texas without more delay. There is no saving them else, and I misdoubt that this fellow Vernon is employed on some business above against us, which, it is absolutely necessary that we should gain a knowledge of.” “But this pleading speaks against it. The youth seems really nothing more than a young beginner at the law on his first circuit.” “That may be, and there is no good reason why a young lawyer should not now and then try his hand at a more profitable business. A governor's proclamation, with a reward of two or three thousand dollars, is no bad inducement to a confident youth to try the capture of an outlaw. I must see more of this youth and more of the Governor before I leave them; and the long and the short of the matter is, that we go to your room at once. He is even now, you say, at mother Baxter's.” “Even now,—and more,—another matter of which I forgot to speak—Carter has been with him ever since you came.” “And Vernon lodges with Carter! see you not; can you doubt, Hawkins? If I do, it is only the more resolutely to see how far they are linked together, and to ascertain their objects truly. We must see to it. I will leave you and take the right hand side of the way towards the court house. Send Jenkins round to the crooked oak with my horse, that he may be conveniently in readiness. I may have to scud on short notice. That done, take your way to Baxter's, and meet me at the entrance. Perhaps it would be quite as well to send the old woman into the kitchen, or on some wild goose errand, that the coast may be clear. See to it now, Hawkins, with all your eyes; for we are in no sort of danger here; nobody suspects us, unless we blunder through stupidity or haste.” Saxon looked carefully to his pistols, which were well concealed in the bosom of the overcoat he wore. Nobody would have suspected under the calm, cool, dignified movement, the doomed outlaw, standing on the brink of danger, and thoughtful only on the means of extrication from perils that environed himself and comrades on every hand. His bowie-knife, that dreadful instrument of summary and sanguinary vengeance, whose edge, sharpened to a razor's keenness, was rendered still more terrible by the condensed weight of a sabre thrown into its back, was adjusted in his breast so as to answer the first movements of his hand; and, with the confidence of one who has prepared himself at all points for the worst, the bold man, who must already be recognised by the reader of our previous work, as an old acquaintance, left the shop of his comrade and emerged calmly into the thoroughfare Proceeding with corresponding boldness, he went forward where the throng was thickest, entered the court-house, looked on and listened for a brief space to the proceedings, then took his way slowly to the house of Mrs. Baxter, where he had appointed to meet with his comrade. Hawkins had so contrived it, as to keep the passage clear. He led him through it with slow and cautious footsteps, up the narrow stairway, and thence into his chamber, which lay on the left hand, being the room opposite that which the governor occupied. The little landing course at the head of the stairs—a sort of platform, some five feet wide, was the only space that separated the two chambers. When Hawkins had closed his door, he gave Saxon to understand that but a few moments had passed since Carter, accompanied by Vernon, VOL. I. 10 had gone into the governor's room, and this intelligence quickened the anxiety of Saxon to inquire into the purport of their business. Though scarcely governed by so keen a motive as the outlaw, let us, however, go forward more boldly than himself to procure the desired knowledge, and at once enter the chamber in which the three are now assembled. We shall lose little by our delay, since the preliminaries of introduction—those little formalities without which the world does no business civilly—occupied the brief space between the entrance of Vernon to the conference, and the beginning of our own and the outlaw's espionage upon its progress. “Our mutual friend, Mr. Carter, assures me, Mr. Vernon, of your perfect capacity to do for me a certain business which is important to the interests of the state, and which requires as much secrecy and courage as intelligence. Can I hope for your assistance?” The youth answered him briefly, that any service not inconsistent with that upon which he was at present engaged would be cheerfully undertaken by him, which would subserve the interests of the state, and oblige his excellency. “But your excellency is not aware, perhaps,” he continued, “that I am to leave Raymond, possibly to-morrow, for the Yazoo neighbourhood.” “It is that fact, in part,” was the reply, “which prompts my application. It is in that very neighbourhood that your assistance will be required. I need not add, that, apart from the state's commission which will be given you, an adequate compensation will be assigned for the time which may be consumed in the service, and the degree of labour and peril to which you may be subjected.” “It will give me pleasure, sir, to serve the state, even without these considerations; but, I must remind your excellency of one qualification with which I prefaced my first reply. If the duties required at my hands, shall, in any way, affect the object which I have in view, and which I must, under existing circumstances, esteem paramount to every other, I shall be compelled to decline the service, though I do so with extreme reluctance, as a loss of opportunity for honourable employment. Will you oblige me, sir, by suffering me to know the nature of the business.” “Certainly. Briefly then: we have advices by express from the authorities of Alabama, which inform us of a singular and extensive plan of outlawry, which has its source either in that state or in ours, and perhaps in both, and numbers no fewer than fifteen hundred adherents in the two. This number has, I doubt not, been grievously exaggerated. If it be not, we are in very sad condition. Of one thing these letters assure me, that many of our citizens, hitherto held in good esteem, are sworn confederates of these banditti, and in one disguise or another trail through all parts of the state, and sometimes operate in fixed places with even more effect, as they appear under characters the more specious and imposing. Then we have positive intelligence that one of our justices of the peace belongs to this band, and we are scarcely in doubt that a militia officer, of whom the public has hitherto thought very highly, is himself a leader among these outlaws. Their commander in chief, one Clym or Clem Foster, made his escape from certain citizens of Tuscaloosa county about three weeks ago, and was reported to have crossed over by way of Cotton-gin Port within the last ten days. A man answering to his description was seen in that neighbourhood about that time. Thus, you have in brief the aspect of affairs. You see one of the chief difficulties in our way. To move openly, and with a force drawn from any other quarter of the state, to act upon that in which these scoundrels congregate, would be only to expel them temporarily, and we should fail probably in taking a single prisoner. To place a special commission in the hands of any unknown person in that neighbourhood, would be equally indiscreet, since it might be placing the whole power of the state, for the time, in the control of one of the very banditti whom we are striving to subdue. We want a bold spirit, who will act vigorously when occasion serves; but one who can keep his secret, work himself so adroitly as to sound those with whom he mingles, sift the worthy from the unworthy, and embody them in the proper moment for the capture or destruction of these wretches.” Vernon heard the speaker with close attention. We have summed up in short, what was only delivered in a dialogue of some length, in which the questions of the former necessarily led to the revelation of many facts, of which, it is quite probable, the governor spoke with some reluctance and with very imperfect knowledge. When these facts had been obtained, the answer of Vernon was immediate. “Your excellency shall judge for yourself of what service I can be to you in this business, and how far it will prove consistent with my present objects to accept of your appointment. While you will not deem my reluctance to arise from any lack of desire to do my duty to the country which protects me, you will, at the same time, hold me guiltless of the vanity which would assume me to be possessed of those endowments which you esteem, and correctly, to be necessary to the proper success of the person you select. You are probably, in part, advised of the mission upon which I go to the Yazoo. I am in pursuit of one, also a criminal, who, for aught we know, may be one of these very banditti. Will it be my policy to undertake this trust, when its execution may lead me into conflicts and necessities which may defeat my present purpose?” “Will it not?” replied the governor. “The capture of one of the band, the discovery of the secrets of one, and that one not the person whom you pursue— will these not be rather more likely than not, to lead also to his detection?” “I am afraid not, your excellency. Apart from the obvious consequence of taking upon myself an additional employment, which must be, to a certain extent, the diversion of my attention from, and my pursuit of, the one object; these felons, according to your own showing, are in possession of so complete a system, that unless you strike them, by a simultaneous blow upon every link of their operation, you endanger the success of your whole project. No one man, setting out as I do, with so little preparation, and without concert with any other operatives, can possibly hope to effect any thing in this double business. It would give me pride to act in this matter, as your excellency desires; believe me, sir, I feel deeply this honourable compliment, but I am perfectly convinced, that, unless it positively happened in my way, to act upon the information you give, I should esteem it unwise to go aside from my path, and jeopard the success of that other purpose, which, as it is of vital importance to Mr. Carter, is, I assure you, of little less importance to me.” The governor seemed much chagrined by this answer, and strode the chamber with ill-concealed disquiet. Vernon resumed. “When, however, I decline the assumption of this charge, as a distinct and responsible appointment, your excellency, I do not mean to say that I would not do any thing, if called on in a moment of emergency, 10* to promote the welfare of the state and secure its peace.” “You would confer on this subject with another, should I send him to you—you would act with him if it took you not off from your present business?” demanded the other eagerly. “More, sir; I acknowledge your right, in the state's emergency, to call upon me to risk my life should that be necessary.” “Enough—you shall have blank commissions to use at your discretion, and I will give you—Stay! did you hear nothing, Mr. Carter?” And as the governor put this question his finger pointed to the inner door, leading to the stairway. A slight rustling movement was evident at this moment, and instantly approaching it, his hand was extended to the latch, when it partially unclosed without his aid, as if in consequence of the sudden withdrawal of one's grasp from without. The dark outline of a man was perceptible through the aperture. “The outlaw himself, by heaven!” cried he, as he beheld the indistinct outlines of the person without. “It is Foster—it answers the description.” With these words the governor rushed to the door with the intention of pursuing, but his purpose was defeated by a hand from without, which, grasping the handle, drew it to, and held it firmly against all his efforts. Meanwhile, steps were heard as of one descending the stairs. The moments were precious, and with that promptness of movement which was a prime and distinctive feature in the character of Vernon, and tallied well with his keen intellect, no less than with his great personal strength, he threw his weight with a bound against the obstruction, and tore it with a single effort from its hinges. The frame work was sustained only by the person from without whose grasp had hitherto secured the door. In another moment the arms of the youth were wrapped around him, and, in spite of his exertions, he was hauled into the room to answer for his essay at eavesdropping. “What means this violence, gentlemen,” demanded the eavesdropper, who was no other than Hawkins. “Who are you?—what do you here, and where is the other ruffian, your comrade, sirrah?” “Hard words, sir, and you shall answer for them,” was the reply of the fellow. “I am here because I lodge here—that is my chamber, and by these stairs I descend from it, and go to it when it pleases me. Take your hand from my collar, young one, or I will hurt you.” He accompanied these words with a threatening action, which Vernon, to whom they were addressed, only answered by hurling him to the ground with as much ease as if he had been an infant; setting his knee upon his bosom, and drawing thence the bowie-knife, the possession of which he suspected, as he saw the fellow unbuttoning his vest. “But the greater villain must be secured. I saw his person—I have seen him before, and I am sure I cannot be mistaken. It is Foster—you heard him descending,—he cannot be far,—let us take this fellow forward till we can deliver him to an officer, and set some in pursuit.” “You carry me not from this house,” growled the fellow from beneath the knee of Vernon. “This is my house—my castle—and you shall answer for this, or there's no law for a poor man in Mississippi.” “You shall have law enough, my man,” replied the governor. “Ben Carter—since this fellow will give us the trouble to carry him,—run to the sheriff, and bid him bring his posse. We shall provide him closer lodgings for a time, and he may then play eavesdropper to those who are more of his own complexion.” In due time Hawkins was delivered to the sheriff, and pursuit commenced after the outlaw; but the hounds were soon at fault; the buck had baffled them, and was now out of reach—taking a zigzag course within five miles of Raymond, as coolly as if there were no sheriff within fifty. By night he was back again, and lingered long enough to hear from those who little suspected his interest in the narration, a long story of his own escape, and of Hawkins' commitment. The story went that he and the governor had grappled fairly—that the governor had got all the advantages, but that he had got—off. Which was pretty nearly the true state of the case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. —“I hope that I shall ride in the saddle. O, 'tis a brave thing for a man to sit by himself! He may stretch himself in the stirrups, look about, and see the whole compass of the hemisphere. You're now, my lord, i' the saddle.” Webster—The White Devil. The necessary documents had come, court was over in Raymond, and on a cold, frosty morning, while yet the day only glimmered with a faint redness through the eastern chinks, Harry Vernon, booted and spurred, prepared to mount his good steed, on his journey of adventure. Carter stood beside him, having given his last instructions. He was visibly affected with the thought of parting from one whom he regarded as warmly as he could have done his own and only child; and this feeling was much increased, as he beheld the unreluctant and prompt determination of the youth to undertake and execute to the best of his abilities, a labour which involved the prospect of so much fatigue, and, possibly of so much peril. This last consideration, at the moment of separation pleaded more strongly in the old man's mind than any other. “And yet, Harry, my son,” said he, “when I hear of this banditti, and behold the audacity with which they act, I am afraid to let you go. God forbid that you should risk your life that I might recover or save a few thousands, which I should be suffered but a few years to enjoy, and which I need not now. It is not too late—let William Maitland go, and prosper, if he may, with his ill-gotten treasures,—why should I send after him, to possible loss, one that I value so much more? Why should you take this toil, which takes you from a profession which you have so honourably begun; and carries you among the profligate and the dangerous.” “Nay, nay, my more than father;” replied the youth affectionately, “you make the risks too great, and the matter less important than it is. There is but little danger, I trust, as I shall manage the pursuit; and it was only in order to avoid unnecessary encounters, that I declined accepting the governor's offers. On this point I shall be well guarded. I shall proceed slowly, moderately; neither seeking the crowd, nor yet avoiding it; and only penetrating into forbidden places, when there are probabilities of my finding William Maitland within. The loss is much greater than you think for, since, though you are liable only for the amount of your bond, yet, in a moral point of view, you are not free from responsibility for all the money over that amount, of which he has robbed the bank. Your readiness to answer for his honesty, implied in your guarantee for so much money, induced their trusts; and though they may demand of you but thirty thousand dollars in law, in morals you owe it clearly to them to spare no exertions which shall, in addition, get them back the other sums for which they have no responsible guarantee. A moment's reflection, under your own convictions of what is right, must clearly establish to your mind this truth. As for my danger—set your heart at rest, as I shall certainly set mine. I have a cool, deliberate temper, which will not flare up at every fool's folly, and I am, I think, sufficiently under the guidance of prudent thought, to keep from the heels of any brute in his moment of anger. Give me your prayers, my dear sir, when I am gone, and I know not that I shall find or need any better protection.” “Yet it is needful, my son, that you have some of the more carnal engines. You have weapons?” “Enough, if pistol and bowie-knife can ever be enough. I have a pair of pistols, and a small but heavy knife. I doubt if I shall need them.” “I have then only to repeat what I have said before, Harry: I have no desire to drive this man to utter destitution. He has children—the children of Ellen Taylor, and she in her grave. God forbid that I should do any thing to make them destitute or wretched. Let him yield up every thing, and, as I have told you, I will secure to them the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, under such restrictions as will keep it from his creditors, and from his own profligacy. I need not say to you, however, that he is one upon whom you cannot rely; you must have him in your power; you must keep him in your power, and the money must be disgorged, before you sign papers. Avoid, I need scarcely tell you, all unnecessary exposure of his villany, for her sake, for the sake of her children, both of whom are females.” “You have written, sir, to Mason at Vicksburg?” “Yes, and to Fleetwood at Benton, and Mercer at Lexington. They will provide you with funds when called upon.” “There is nothing more to be asked,” said the youth, leaping to his saddle. “I will write to you at Natchez when necessary. God bless you, my dear sir, and keep you in health—farewell!” He did not stop to hear the parting accents, tremblingly uttered, which the good man sent after him in blessings. In ten minutes the forest had shrouded him from sight, and the tearful eyes of Carter strained after him in vain. Let us return to Saxon, otherwise Clement Foster, the outlaw of Alabama. Having satisfied himself, by personal inquiry, of the condition of Hawkins, his companion, in Raymond, he left the village at midnight, and, to verify the Scripture phrase which denies all rest to the wicked, he rode nearly fifteen miles at that late hour of the night. His course lay somewhat across the country in the direction of Grand Gulf, and came at length to a little farmstead which stood in a half dilapidated condition at the head of a turn-out, that is barely perceptible at any time from the road, and only obvious at night to one familiar with it. Here he routed up two men, who proved his confederates, and with whom he conferred for an hour before retiring to rest. This he did at length in a shed-room of the hovel, which, it would seem from the tacit manner in which it was got in readiness for him, without orders, was reserved for him especially. Some portions of his conference with these men, as they may affect this narrative, should be given to the reader. “Has Jones come up from Pontchartrain?” demanded the leader. He was answered by one of the men in the negative. “He will then be here to-morrow, but I shall not wait for him. He must go on as fast as horseflesh will carry him, and meet me if he can at Brown Betsy's to-morrow night. You can counsel him to come sober, if he comes at all, for I wish him to skulk and follow, and play at point-hazard, perhaps, with as keen a lawyer as rides the Mississippi circuit. Be sure and tell him this, that he may drink his alkalis and purge himself of the gin bottle. It is a day's purgation; but he must do it while he goes. He brings your share of the money from the Atchafalaya business; but, by the Lord Harry, Stanton, money seems to do you little good. You are even now in rags.” “That's because I don't get it by good means, I suppose,” said the fellow spoken to, in half-sleepy, half-surly accents. “What, do you preach too, sirrah! But—go to bed, and forget not when you waken what I tell you now. You will also remember it, Drake. The matter is of more consequence than you think for, and will swamp us all, if we keep not our eyes open and our heads clear. To sleep—to sleep.” At day-dawn, the outlaw was again in motion, visiting other haunts and dwellings of his fraternity, that lay in his way, while pursuing an upward course that carried him along the waters of the Loosa Chitto or Big Black river. It so happened that this very course was that taken by Vernon, though the latter, as his progress was straight-forward, was necessarily much in advance of the outlaw. At the time of which we write, this region of country was very thinly settled. The traveller rode forty or fifty miles per day, very frequently without seeing sign of human habitation, and his road lay through swamps that seemed like vast rivers of mire, which his horse, with a feeling like his own, would approach with a footstep most mincing and deliberate. Travel in such a territory is travail, indeed, and to one accustomed only to the stage and steamboat facilities of the Atlantic states, it has the aspect of something even more afflicting. The swimming of creeks surcharged by freshets, and wading through the ooze of a cane-brake, each plunge into which makes the mire quiver around the very shoulders of your horse, would be something of a warning to young couples to stay at VOL. I. 11 home the first month after marriage, in that neighbourhood, and not go upon connubial expeditions of two or three hundred miles, just after the knot has been safely fastened. Its disruption might be no infrequent consequence of such a doubtful practice. To one like Vernon, however, bold, and governed by a temperament that gloried in a dash of romance, the occasional perils of such a course were lost altogether in the novelty of the circumstances; and he dashed through the creek with a confident spur, without stopping like more wary adventurers to probe his footing with a pole, then drive his horse through the stream, while he “cooned a log” above it. These little obstructions were not unfrequent in his route, but they offered no impediment to him. The duties of life and manhood, opening for the first time upon his consciousness fairly, were provocative of that stimulant only, which we are apt to see in the forward boy, to whom nothing gives so much delight as being permitted to flourish with the tools of full-grown men. He had neither father nor mother, with painful misgivings of himself, to awaken his own painful thoughts; and, unlike most young men of his age, his heart remained perfectly uncommitted to any one of the hundred damsels, who, in every civilized community, seem always to lie in waiting for vacant hearts. In short, he had little to lose of positive possession, whether of wealth or of affection; he had every thing to gain in both respects. His income was yet limited, and for ties, he knew none nearer than that with the worthy Mr. Carter. His present object was calculated to serve himself no less than his patron, though the handsome reward offered by the bank for the recovery of the lost money, or the delivery of the felon, would never have moved the proud young lawyer from his chosen place at the bar, but that the interests of his friend— his preservation, in fact—absolutely required it. But this the reader already understands. The turn of noon was at hand, and as yet our young traveller had eaten nothing. The thought of himself made him considerate of his horse, a noble animal, the gift of Carter some two years before. A pleasant rising-ground on his right, from the foot of which a little branch wandered prattling across the road, suggested all necessary conveniences for refreshment, the other appliances being forthcoming. “We will ride, Sylvan, up this hill, which seems grassy enough to give you a good hour's employment, and, in the meanwhile, Mrs. Horsey's biscuits and smoked beef shall answer my purposes. The good old lady!—how she wondered to find her plate of biscuits missing, and how she routed the cook and Tom, the waiter, and the whole household, except the true thief, touching their loss. I suppose by this time Carter has told her all about it—the why and the wherefore. Good old man! If I can only save him this money, I shall feel that I have done something to deserve the favour which he has always shown me. If mind and body can do this thing, such as I have shall be given without stint or hesitation to the task,—so heaven prosper me in my own purposes hereafter.” This soliloquy was muttered as the youth rode his horse upon the hill, and led him to a spot where he might graze freely without wandering. He stripped him of the saddle and valise, which he placed beside a log, then seating himself, drew forth his little store of provisions, the biscuits which had been appropriated by Carter the night before, to the probable consternation of his worthy landlady. To have asked for them, would have been to declare the purpose of travel which Vernon had in view, and this, once known to the mother would have been soon known to son Tom, and through his communicative medium to every third person, at least, in the little world of Raymond. The knife of our traveller was already buried in the smoked beef, when his ear distinguished a sound not unlike that of an approaching horseman. The ears of his own steed pricked upward at the sound, and when it became more distinct, the conscious animal whinnied as if with the joyful conviction that he was about to have a companion. Vernon started to his feet as the horseman came in sight, and was absolutely dumb with astonishment to recognize at a single glance the person of our eccentric friend, Tom Horsey. His horse was well heated by hard riding, and covered with foam; and he himself, though chuckling mightily at having found the object of his search, alighted from his steed with the air of one whose bones ached with his unwonted jolting. “Ah, Harry, Harry—what shall I say to thee, Harry! Shall I call thee a traitor to friendship—to heel it before day-peep, and say no word to the fellow most after thy own heart. `That was the unkindest cut of all.' I did not think it of thee, Harry! By the ghost of Garrick, I did not!” Much annoyed at his pursuit and presence, Vernon was quite too much surprised at the event, and too curious to know the cause of the actor's pertinacity, to express himself as freely, and perhaps as harshly, as he might otherwise have done. “Truly, Mr. Horsey, I know not what you mean, or what you have to complain of. I am surprised to see you here.” “You need be; you deserve no such love at my hands, Harry Monmouth. You should have spoken out like a man—though you said it in a whisper. Am I a man to blab? Can't I be trusted, think you? By Pluto, Harry Vernon, I can be as close as Ben Carter himself, and the dry cock should never have heard a syllable. Bah, I am monstrous tired. That rascally horse goes all one-sided,—he has been ruined by dad, and will never suit any but a lame man again. I do think he has dislocated my hip.” “Your father's horse, Mr. Horsey? How can the old man do without him? You will surely return with him immediately.” “Devil a bit, Harry, devil a bit. He deserves to lose him for not having a better in the stable, and I will trade him off the first chance, though I get one old as Methusaleh.” “But wherefore are you here, Mr. Horsey? You do not mean to travel, surely.” “Do I not? Look at the bags!—Filled, sir—filled to the muzzle, with my best wardrobe. There's a Romeo and a Hamlet, two field-officers and a Turk in that wallet, not to speak of certain inexpressibles, which will do for a dozen uncertain characters. But—this is dry work. What's in your flask?” He did not wait to be answered, but clapped the bottle, which lay with the bread and beef at Vernon's feet, to his mouth, and long and fervent was the draught which he made therefrom. “Good whisky that, and whisky's an honest beverage. And now, Harry, a bite of your biscuit. You will laugh, perhaps, but of a truth, I look upon Falstaff's proportion of bread and sack, as decidedly the best for a traveller in winter. `This is a nipping and an eager air,' and nothing blunts its edge so well as a good sup of Monongahela. This dough stuff makes one feel as dry and crusty as itself. But you do not eat, Vernon.” “Why truly, sir, I am so surprised to see you here, that I had almost forgotten that I was hungry. But, perhaps, you bring me some message from Mr. Carter?” 11* “Carter, indeed! Oh, no! I was quite too sly for that. The moment Jim told me you were off— for it seems he saw you and Carter go to the stable by dawn, or, as he swears, before it—I had just risen to take my antifogmatic; and at the word, I at once guessed what you were after!—” “Indeed! And pray what was that?” demanded Vernon, with some curiosity, interrupting the garrulous speaker. “Ah, ha! all in good season, my master. You thought to blink me, Harry, but you must know I had a hint of your true business two days before from some clever chaps in Raymond.” The wonder of Vernon increased, but the other suffered him as little time to indulge it as to make inquiries. “I tipped Jim the wink—set him to saddle Gray Bowline, dad's old dot and go one, and fasten him behind the stable, while I donned my first come atables, and rammed the rest in dad's old saddle-bags, where I'll show them to you when you please. These I handed to the sooty scamp, who will do any thing for my love—when paid in money—and he got the nag caparisoned in twenty minutes, and ready to my heel. Down stairs I went, and—plump!— met the old lady, my ever venerable mamma, in the passage-way. `Tom,' says she, `where are you going so soon?' `Don't ask me, mother,' says I, looking monstrous hurried, and going fast ahead, `don't ask me, I beg you;' and off I went. In two minutes I was on, and off. A few bounds brought me into the woods, and your track was fresh enough for the eyes of a young hunter. I heard of you once by the way, but—your nag goes monstrous fast, if he goes easy! Mine!—by the petticoats of Ophelia after her drowning—he has skinned me utterly all of one side. I have found you, however, my dear Harry, and I don't value the skinning. We shall never part again. Skin or no skin under my bends, I keep up with you though the devil's brimstone smokes under your horse's tail.” “Indeed, Mr. Horsey, but there go two words to that bargain,” replied Vernon, with an air of resoluteness, and a face of but half-concealed chagrin. “`Agreed' shall be one of them, Harry,” replied the unembarrassed actor. “But how, Mr. Horsey, if I tell you that our roads lie apart.” “Impossible!—they do not, Harry—by my soul they do not! I have the best information on that subject. As I said before, I know your secret— your whole plan of operations, and, by all the blessings of the foot-lights and a fine audience, if you do not suffer me to join with you in the business and share profits, I'll run against you. I'll take the morsel from your mouth, `And pluck the golden-eyed success away From your young grasp.”' “What can this witless fellow drive at!” was the unspoken soliloquy of Vernon, ere he replied to the speaker. “Can he really know any thing?—it is scarcely possible. There is some mistake; and I must sound him cautiously.” Aloud:— “And what may be this goodly scheme of mine, Mr. Horsey, in which your mind is so resolutely resolved to share. I am positively puzzled, and know not how it is possible that a purely private business—” “Purely private, you call it. 'Egad, before I'm done with it, it shall be public enough. You thought yourself mighty secret in your schemings, and I confess you did blind me for awhile, and I took it for granted that you really had no other object in view than to run the dry course of a lean lawyer, and jog from court-house to court-house, circuit after circuit, picking up your pay in corn and bacon, and getting a bastard fame from speeches as full of words as Gratiano's, made in cases of trespass, pounding, black eyes, and bloody noses. I give you credit, now that I discover your purpose, for being something bolder, and for an ambition of a more enduring and ennobling sort. But I can hardly forgive you, Harry, for keeping a dumb side to me when you knew my passion. I can be trusted, as you shall see. You will find me a man after your own heart, if your heart be open;—a fellow wise enough to speak only upon cues, though otherwise a born rattler; and one who, whatever his woolheaded neighbours may say, can always `tell a hawk from a handsaw,' in whatever quarter the wind may blow.” “Puzzle on puzzle!” exclaimed Vernon, now more than ever convinced that his companion was mad. “What is it that you really mean, Mr. Horsey? speak plainly, or I shall suspect you to be a candidate for bedlam or the calaboose.” “Bedlam or the calaboose! Come! I don't like that so well, Harry Vernon. I take it as something unkind, sir, that you should speak in such fashion. But, I see how it is; I forgive you; it is natural enough that you should look on me as one likely to go between you and the public. But you shall find me generous. By the powers, Harry, I care not much where I come in, whether as one, two, or three, when a friend's fortune and desires are concerned. You shall go before, and I will follow, or we will enter side by side, on equal terms, marching to equal victory. Envious or jealous of rival merit, I never was and trust never to become, satisfied that success has twenty thousand hands, and one willing for every bold, worthy fellow that stands ready and dares to grasp it. Harry Vernon, I drink to our joint success.” The actor repeated his draught, but Vernon began to be seriously annoyed by the intrusion, and thought it high time to put an end to it. Never dreaming of the conjecture which had taken such possession of his companion's brain, and ignorant, of course, of the stories which had been told him, he could form no positive idea of the subject of his ravings, and began seriously to consider him a fitting inmate for the calaboose or bedlam, as he had already suggested to the other's momentary discomfiture. His first movement, therefore, was to restore his spirit-flask to the valise, then, assuming what calmness of manner he could, and taking especial care that while his words should be inoffensive, they should be to the point at least, he addressed him in a manner which was intended to bring his play at cross-purposes to a conclusion. “You have said a great deal, Mr. Horsey, which for the life of me I cannot understand. Pray tell me, without quotation or circumlocution, what it is you mean—what you intend—and above all what scheme it is, which you assume that we entertain in common. I am not peevish nor fretful in my disposition, yet I am not willing to suffer any trifling or merriment at my expense.” “Or, in more legitimate phrase, considering our purposes,” repeated the actor— “`Though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear.' Prithee, my good Hamlet, smooth thy looks, and dismiss that cloud, full of lightning, that teems in threatening above thy brows. I mean thee no harm, no hurt, no offence. I am a fellow, as I tell thee, after thy own heart, and thou dost wrong thyself no less than me, to be angry with me. Why wouldst thou that I should tell thee in plain, point-blank matter, what is thy business, and what should be mine?—as if thou wast resolved not to know, and couldst deceive me any longer. Dost thou not seek Tilton?” “Tilton!” exclaimed Vernon in profound astonishment, mingled with something more of good humour than before, as it now became obvious to him that Horsey had blundered upon the wrong man, and knew nothing of his secret, of which he had been in some little apprehension. “Ay, Tilton, Tilton, the little lamplighter and candle-snuffer and letter-carrier for so many years at C—dwell's. He, who has now set up to be an actor, a manager, and what not; and is going to open at Benton, where thou and I—if thy stomach be not too proud, Harry Vernon, for such companionship, as I greatly fear me,—will star it together, to the confusion and admiration of the natives. There, you have it; and might have saved me all this trouble by owning to the truth before. Deny me now if thou canst, my bully rook; thou art not aiming at Benton,—thou dost not seek for Tilton, —thou wouldst not leave the dry bones of the law, for the wit of Mercutio and the marrow of Falconbridge. In short, thy ambition leads thee not to emulate the Garricks and the Keans, the Macreadys, the Forrests, the Coopers, the—” The unmitigated laughter of Vernon silenced the actor, whose face of exultation it turned of a sudden into soberness. “What do you laugh at, Mr. Vernon, I should like to know!” “Who put this silly thought into your head, Mr. Horsey? Who could have bedevilled you with this nonsense?” “Bedevilled!—Silly thought! I see nothing silly about it, Master Vernon, and wonder that you should. Do you deny it?” “Every syllable.” “What, that you are about to appear on the stage?” “I do.” “You are not going to Benton to join the company?” “On my soul, I am not.” “Or wherever the company may act? You go not to join Tilton?” “I know nothing of the man.” “It won't do—that cock won't fight, Harry Vernon,” responded the other, after a pause. “I have the matter on good evidence. Deny it as you may, I believe it; begging your pardon for seeming to doubt you; but the truth is, that all the circumstances tell against you. I am sure you are going to join Tilton, and, my dear fellow, confess the truth; you will not trust me with your secret, for fear that I shall blab it to Ben Carter. But, on my honour—” “Believe what you will, Mr. Horsey,” replied the other with recovered gravity. “I have no sort of objection to any strange notion that you may take into your head; only, I pray that you may not bother me with the mare's nests that you may discover, nor challenge my admiration of the eggs.” “You're angry with me, Harry. Come, my dear boy, hand out your flask again, and we'll take a sup of reconciliation.” “No, sir; I will let you drink no more while you are with me. You have taken a mouthful too much already.” “How, sir, do you mean—” The swagger of the worthy histrion, who was not apt to be a braggart, and was in truth a good-meaning fellow, was cut short by the sudden and angry interruption of his more solid and resolute companion: “Look you, Mr. Horsey, my road lies above, and yours is below, with your parents. Let us separate.” “Nay, nay, Harry Vernon; but you are quite too hard upon me. Don't be vexed with me, because I am a d—d good-natured fool, that loves good company too well to quarrel with it. I don't mean to vex you, but I am resolved, unless you put a bullet through my cranium, to keep up with you to Benton. I'd rather lose any thing short of life than lose the chance of a good engagement. So, whither thou goest, thither will I go also,—where thou leadest there will I follow,—at least, until the manager gives out the casts, and then, Harry, as thou wilt, and the author pleases.” This resolution, though it annoyed Vernon, as it expressed a determination to keep with him whether he would or not, and might for a while operate against his objects, was yet expressed in terms and a manner so very conciliatory, and the poor histrion seemed so completely to speak from his heart, that Vernon resolved to bear with him awhile, nothing doubting, that when the other found, as he was like to do in another day, that his footsteps did not incline to the place where the actors had pitched their tents, he would be very willing to leave him without more words. He contented himself, therefore, with renewing his assertion that he had nothing to do with the players, and that Horsey deceived himself, or had been grossly misled on the subject of his inclining to the stage. But the re-asseveration was of no avail. The faith was infixed too deeply, and with a chuckle, as he mounted his nag, the enthusiastic actor replied— “Oh, what's the use, Harry, my boy, of keeping up that ball? It must come down sooner or later, and one would think you would be weary of such a sport. Let this humour cool—`it is no good humours.' Look not coldly upon me, for, on my soul, if thou wilt have it so, thou shalt have the choice of the cast whatever it may be, and as for little Tilton, he shall learn as a first lesson, that we shall neither of us do any thing for him, unless we do it to our own liking. And now to horse—to horse— `Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.”' It was scarce possible for Vernon to resist laughter; certainly, he found it impossible to keep anger with such a creature; a thing so light, so weak, so utterly wanting in all those timely calculations of propriety and good providence, as to make it seem a sort of brutality to visit upon his faults with harshness. They took horse together, and while they rode, the actor seasoned the way and dialogue with quotations, “Thick as leaves in Valambrosa.” Vernon strove at every opportunity to disabuse his mind of the error which it had adopted in reference to himself; but his very earnestness seemed only the more to convince the other to the contrary. His answer to all such efforts consisted only of a half laughing rebuke to his companion, who aimed at the monopoly of the best character, and was jealous of that interposition and rivalship on his part, which he studiously assured Vernon, at the same time, should never annoy him. The latter gave up the effort which he found so perfectly unavailing, leaving it to time, the general rectifier of man's mistakes, to put a conclusion to this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 12 CHAPTER IX. “How indirectly all things are fallen out! I cannot choose but wonder what they were, Rescued your rival. — If I fit you not With such a new and well-laid stratagem, As never yet your ears did hear a finer, Call me with Lilly, Bos, Fur, Sus atque Sacerdos.” Ben Jonson—Tale of a Tub. Youth is not the season for enduring enmities. That is a cold heart and a malignant spirit which preserves its bitterness and asperities through the summer, and in spite of all its sunshine. Harry Vernon, besides being of a just and generous nature, was also of a cheerful and social one, and he soon discovered that there was no good reason for keeping up a cloudy front to the vacillating and wayward creature who rode beside him, and whom an erring judgment and, probably, fine but misdirected endowments, were hurrying on to his own destruction. By degrees he resumed his kindly manner to the obtrusive but well-meaning actor, and as he found that he could not rid himself of his company, he resolved to make the most of it. This resolution once taken, it required but few words on the part of Vernon to unlock all the stores of memory and experience in Horsey's possession. The erratic creature, from long wandering into forbidden places, had picked up a wholesale, if not wholesome, collection of anecdote and story. His imitative faculties were good, and he illustrated his scenes by taking off, with considerable humour, the various persons who appeared in them. Shakespeare, too, was at his fingers' ends, and there was no lack of passages, to fill out his own remarks, and enliven their deficiencies. The dog read well, too, with the single reservation, that he had not yet learned that nice and most necessary art of all—that art which scarcely one of our artists possesses in a meritorious degree,—of subduing his utterance to the demands of the character, and the capacities of his own voice. This evil results, in most cases, from the too great size of the theatre, which, as it calls for great physical powers of voice, must, except in the case of energies singularly masculine, for ever defeat its nicer regulations. Horsey had throat enough, and the very best of lungs, and he was glad of any opportunity for using them. The woods soon rang with his sonorous passages, and Vernon, with the feeling of the cautious citizen always alive to ridicule, could not help now and then looking around him, as if apprehensive that other ears were suffering from those clamours that seemed almost to perforate his own anew. These declamations, be it understood, however, were not given with the reckless rapidity of one who has nothing beside in store of his own; but the actor ingeniously contrived that they should only occur in such places in his own dissertations where they might enforce and illustrate what he said. This was one of his arts additional, by which he contrived that his masterpieces should be brought in play; and, like the fellow who had a gun-story, and in order to introduce it fairly into company, acquired the art of imitating the report of a pistol, so Tom Horsey practised, when alone, those generalizing opinions on a thousand subjects, under some one of which he could always classify the fine things of Brutus and Cassius, Hamlet, Hotspur, and Macbeth. When, with a generous consideration of his companion, and a moderation which few great talkers are prone to practise, he had tired himself fairly down, he came to a halt, and declared aloud his resolution to pause in time, for fear he should also tire down his hearer. “But, could you hear me, Harry, when the scene is filling, when the characters are by, the audience silent and watchful, and the curtain drawn—it would be something. You would say it were something, and that I were no insane fool, as some of dad's friends will have it, and Ben Carter among them. I feel that I have it in me, Harry Vernon, and, by the Lord Harry, but it shall come out. I have never had a fair chance yet, but the time must come. Hitherto, they have taken advantage of my necessity, and I have been compelled to walk through wooden parts, which I scorned to move in with any wasteful animation of my own. Nothing but the delight of being upon the boards, amidst the blessed blaze of lights which are no where so lovely to my eyes as in a playhouse, could have made me endure the damnable persecution and miserable jealousies of those poor, incapable creatures, that were able to do nothing themselves, and hated the very sight of others who had it in them to do every thing. I could tell you stories of the drudgery of the stage, of the malice and the meanness of the actors, of the mercenary baseness of managers, their impracticability and insolence when successful, and their d—d dishonesty when otherwise, which would shock you to hear, and which you could scarcely ever believe. But you will learn for yourself. One week with the little lamplighter,— unless you make a hit—and then you can snap your fingers in his face, and kick him with your worst boots, and still have his thanks,—one week with him, however, as a stock-player, and you will curse your stars that endowed you with faculties, yet left them at the mercy of such eternal skunks as your generality of managers are sure to be. But let us bully little Tilton, and play our own characters, work our way up the Mississippi, break out like little comets with a double length of tail in Louisville and Cincinnati, and, by-and-by, touch the Park boards—the zenith of theatrical eminence in America, where, Mr. Kean told us, with an equivocal sort of compliment, that the taste for the drama was periodical—and then, the devil take the hindmost— hey, for the crown and the triumph, the chariots and the horsemen— “`A kingdom for a stage—princes to act, And monarchs to behold the swelling scene.”' “Supper first,” said Vernon, “or I shall never sufficiently ascend that highest heaven of invention, to behold with you so respectable an audience, or to regard it with any sort of satisfaction when I do so. Look ahead—see you nothing of a log house? There should be one on the left, a little in the woods. That must be our baiting-place to-night; and if you will prick up your beast, Mr. Horsey, which, in your own industry, you have been indulging long enough, we shall probably avoid the prospect, of which there is some present danger, of being compelled to sleep in Big Black Swamp to-night, with nothing but Shakspeare to keep us warm or satisfy our hunger.” “And enough too. He has kept me warm and been my only supper many a night. But, I do see something 12* of an opening, and it is to the left. By the ghost of David, Harry Vernon, an' if it shall be a large one, we'll have a few passages—we'll make a rouse. `Because thou art virtuous shall there be no more cakes and ale!'—it is a house—`ay, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.”' “Hush!” said Vernon, with singular gravity. “Be still, if you do not want to lose every chance of supper. Chickens in these parts take to the woods whenever they hear or see a stranger—they know, poor devils, by a sort of instinct, the fate that awaits them.” “'Gad, if that be true, it is a very singular fact. Are you serious, Master Vernon?” “Serious! Do you think I could jest about such a matter? But see—there's the woman of the house. She must have heard you the last three miles. If not utterly out of voice from your late exertions, you will perhaps be the best spokesman here. See if we can get beds and bacon—the chickens, I suppose, unless she has them in coop already, cannot be thought of.” “A very singular fact!” muttered Horsey, as, giving spur to his steed, he led the way to the wigwam, leaving Vernon to follow at his leisure. “Accommodations!” said the woman, who was a somewhat ill-favoured person, probably forty years of age, having a face sober and grave even to sternness, and speaking in accents slow, harsh, and indifferent—“have I accommodations for two for the night? Yes, sir, I have, but they are none of the best, and neither of you gentlemen would be much the better of them. Perhaps, you'd better ride farther,—and you'll be suited better. The night's clear enough, though it be cool, and if you're going to strike for the lower ferry, you'll get a place to lie at, ten miles ahead. The upper ferry-house is farther on, but not much, and the road's pretty clear in a starlight. You'd better ride on, I'm thinking.” “Nay, my good madam, that will hardly suit us,” replied Vernon, riding up—“we have already ridden near forty miles to-day, having come from Raymond, and I am resolved, unless you positively deny us shelter, to go no farther to-night.” “I'm sure I don't deny you, sir; I only tell you how little we can do here to make you comfortable. We're mighty poor people in these parts, and have little to give strangers to make them satisfied. Now, ten miles beyond—” “No more, my good madam,” said Vernon, alighting from his horse; “we stop with you to-night; and the sooner you give us supper the better. In the meantime, you can tell my friend here what I have already told him, that your chickens have already taken to the woods.” “Chickens—” The speech of the woman was cut short by Horsey, who had been steadily watching her features with an air of interest, and who now advanced, laid his hand on her shoulder, with a degree of familiarity that made her start and look disquieted, if not angry, as she strove to withdraw herself from so great a freedom. This, however, he would not suffer. “By the cut of your teeth, as the cheese said to the mouse, I know you, my worthy professor of sassafras and gunja. Brown Bessy Clayton, as I live!” “And who are you, young mister, that's so free with my name?—my name that was, I mean—for though I'm Brown Bess, I'm no Clayton now. What's your name?” “Why, Bess, you're getting old, my girl,—your memory's failing you. Don't you remember me— don't you remember little Tom Horsey, that was your best customer when you sold cakes and beer at Hogler's mill—that burst your bottles by shaking, and punched your cakes out of the tray by a long pole sharpened at the end?” “Yes, and got punched for it himself,” responded the woman, as these reminiscences of Horsey awakened her own. “And is it you, Tom—little Tom, indeed? Why, you can eat your cakes now off my shoulder.” “Ay, Bess, and a bit of the shoulder with it, when I happen to be so hungry as I am just now. And so you're married,—and who did you marry, Bess?—I hav'n't heard of you for these ten long years.” “But I've heard tell of you, Tom Horsey. They said you'd gone crazy, and that didn't seem strange, for you always had a little twist in your understanding, and couldn't do things jist like other people.” “Did you ever hear such a defamation of genius?” exclaimed Horsey to Vernon in a manner of affected misery. “But go on, Bess. What did you hear?” “Why, they said as how you had turned fair fool, and how they'd got you down among the player-people at Orleans, and how they dressed you up in a jacket and breeches full of colours and spangles—” “My Romeo, by the shade of Juliet!” “And how,” continued the woman, “they brought you out before the company, and worried you, jist like so many curs worrying a pig that had got into the 'tato patch—” “Exquisite comparison, by my soul!” “And how they all stuck at you with their swords, and how you fell down and pretended to be dead, and then how they dragged you out by the heels; while every body, men and women, little and big, laughed as if they would split. After that I heard no more of you, and concluded you were dead for good.” “For good, say you?” exclaimed the actor, as the woman concluded. “Well, Vernon, only think now that this is the representation of one of my best performances,—my debut in Macbeth, for my benefit—when it so happened that a cargo of Ishmaelites from Pearl River, that had crossed Ponchartrain that day, came to the `American,' with `every particular hair on end,' to see their `old schoolfellow, Tom Horsey, son of John Horsey, the lame man that kept tavern on the river-road:' and this is the d—nable report which they carried back to the country in their ignorance and envy. Is it not a most abominable trait in man, that he hates to see his neighbour's successes? Every whipster with whom he ever hunted 'possum in a dark night, or shelled corn in husking-time, is ready to disparage those talents which he cannot rival, and to pull down that merit in a companion which he thinks—and it is—a sarcasm upon his own deficiencies. By Pompey's ghost, it is my own people that have ever been the first to decry my performances, and to wrest from me the just rewards of my labours.” “Well, don't you be running down the Pearl River people, Tom Horsey; they're a mighty good sort of people, Tom, and I only wish I was back ag'in among 'em,” said the woman. “Selling cakes and beer?” said Tom. “Why, yes, sellin' cakes and beer; it's a mighty good business for the time it lasts.” “Five months at least, Bess—I remember all about it—from May to September, and if the season was very warm, a month longer. 'Gad my picayunes melted as rapidly in those months, when I was a boy, as my Mexicans have continued to melt ever since I was a man.” “There was another thing, Tom, that they told about you,” said the woman. “What was that?” quickly demanded the actor. “Why, that you spent your father's money a deuced sight faster than he could make it, and that you are a mighty great—” “Say no more, Brown Bess; leave it where it is, at the `mighty great.”' “Riprobate, I was going to say,” continued the matter of fact woman; “and I reckon, Tom, it is not far from the right word.” “Perhaps not, Bess; but no more of that an' thou lovest me; I am reformed now—grown quite sober—never drink unless when the spirit moves, and I expect soon to confess a working of mind as active as ever was your beer, whenever I can meet with old brother Abrams—” “Why he's dead!—dead five years ago!” exclaimed the woman. “Dead, you say! Who could have thought it. Why he was the last regular preacher that I ever heard. It makes me melancholy to think of it; so let's in to supper, Vernon, with what appetite we may. You're married, Bess? Where's your husband, and what is he—what's his name?” A dark cloud rose and rested on the woman's brow as she heard this question, which she answered slowly and briefly. “His name's Yarbers—he's a middle-aged man that'll be in, I reckon, directly. But I'm truly thinking, Tom, that you and the other gentleman had much better ride on to the other house. It's a short ten miles, and an easy road.” “Can't think of it, Bess; by the soul and substance of the fat knight, I cannot. We must partake of your hog and hominy to-night; and I'm surprised, Bess, that you seek to send us forward without supper. You were not wont to be so inhospitable. Marriage has changed you, Bess.” “I reckon it has, Tom,” said the woman, “but I'm not wanting you to go without supper. I could get it ready for you in a short five minutes, and you might easily ride then.” “By the Lord Harry, Bess, but this is altogether too bad! What! pack us off the moment we've swallowed our coffee, on a long road in a dark night! I tell you, Bess, it won't do. We sleep in your house to-night, by the peepers of that blessed saint Monajahadjee, of the Chickasaws, that slept every day in the week but the eighth, and never opened one eye, unless it was to see if the other was shut.” “Well, just as you will, Tom, but, perhaps, the other gentleman here?—” “The other gentleman here is my Castor; we are Castor and Pollux, the inseparables. He never goes without me, and I never go without him, and so, strange as it may seem to you, we never go without one another. If we never go without one another, we also never stay without one another, and, Bess, I have drawn this proposition almost syllogistically to you, in order that you should understand that we shall sleep together in the same bed, provided you cannot spare us one apiece.” “Ah, Tom, you're the same rattlepate that you ever was; and the older you grow, the wiser you don't grow. I can't understand the half you say.” “Not understand! Did ever one hear the like, when I stated the case with singular simplicity in order that you should understand.” “Well, well,” responded the woman, “but let Mr. Castor speak for himself. He don't say much, and I reckon it'll be the easier for me to understand him. I was saying, sir,” here she addressed herself to Vernon, “I was saying, Mr. Castor—” “Ha! ha! ha!” was the ecstatic roar of Horsey, who made no attempt to correct the error. “Vernon is my name,” said his companion gravely. The old woman gave Horsey a single look of reproof, then turning to Vernon proceeded to repeat what she had already said touching the propriety of his riding to the next tavern, which was at the lower ferry, and only ten miles off, for his night's lodging. Her reason for so singular a suggestion arose from the alleged poverty of her accommodations. “There is something strange in all this: there is something secret here!” was the unexpressed thought of Vernon, and he drew his conclusion as much from the earnest and bewildered countenance of the woman, as from her words. His self-communion went farther: “I am on the borders of the Chittaloosa, and my labours should now properly begin. Every mystery may have mine in its keeping, and I must search it if I can. This woman, it is evident, would send me off rather than Horsey. I will stay.” He spoke this determination aloud. “Mr. Horsey has spoken for both of us, Mrs. Yarbers, and we must stay with you to-night. Forty miles is rather more of a journey than a horse should be made to bear who is going to a swamp country, and I am almost as anxious for sleep as supper.” “Well, if you will,” said the old woman ungraciously, as she ushered them into the hall, and summoned a negro girl to take the horses to the stable. The saddle-bags, valise, and saddles were carried into the house. The travellers drew chairs, rough, country made, high-backed, and seated with untanned deer-skins stretched across and tacked beneath; while the old lady, opening a wooden cupboard of plain pine that was fastened by pegs to the rear wall, drew forth a couple of common junk bottles, one of which, as she said, contained Monongahela, and the other honey, as a sweetener. “A dram will comfort you after you ride, Tom, though if you drink whisky as freely as you used to drink the sassafras, you'll have an enemy in your head that'll be sure soon to trip your heels.” “I am commanded to love mine enemies, Bess, but I try to weaken them a little, so that our wrestle shall be even; there's no water here?” “Mary's gone for some to the spring, Tom; my darter Mary; she'll be here in a shake.” “You've a daughter, too, eh? What sort of a girl is she, Bess? A good, smart, active, little creature, I suppose, a—” The door opened, and the sudden appearance of the daughter in question, silenced the speech, and utterly confounded the speaker for an instant, as he found himself confronted by as tall and pretty an adversary in the shape of a damsel, as ever met the eyes yet of an enthusiastic and self-assured young man. He started to his feet, caught the vessel which she bore from her hands, a little clean white piggin with a gourd hanging upon the handle, and setting it down upon the shelf which was placed for it, exclaimed, all in a breath— “This your daughter, Bess,—this your Mary?— by the Capulets, but she is the very Juliet of the host. I must have a kiss, Mrs. Yarbers—for auld lang syne, Bess—by all the damask roses that ever tried to look like those cheeks, and faded out of envy. I must, Mary—why, Mary, I am your mother's old friend—I'm your great uncle, Mary—an innocent VOL. I. 13 old man,—you need not fear me. I must—there's no use—I must.” The girl, who was probably not more than sixteen, perhaps not that, retreated with no less dignity than modesty, while, between jest and earnest, her mother expostulated with the bashaw; but it is probable that neither the reluctance and possible flight of the damsel, nor the expostulations of the mother, would have availed to protect her from the parental tenderness of the venerable man, but for the sudden interposition of another party, whose mode of proceeding was of a more summary and imposing character. The door opened while the strife was at the warmest, and the husband of the dame entered, followed by a sturdy youth of about twenty years of age. Horsey was too much interested by the game in hand to look behind him, and it was only when the youth, without a word, passed in front, and placed himself between him and the maiden, that he became conscious of the unexpected interruption of his desires. The intruder's presence semed almost as much annoying to Mary as to the enamoured actor. She shrunk back with quite as much promptness from her champion as from her assailant, and this movement probably encouraged Horsey with the idea that his chances were even better now than before. “My worthy rustic,” said he, “give me but a moment, another time I will acknowledge your presence, but just at this time—nay, stand aside, I pray you, that I may do grace to the lips of that little Juliet there—a moment—but a moment.” Suiting the action to the word, Horsey put forth his hand, intending, with the utmost gentleness, to put him aside from his path; but his hand had scarcely touched the shoulder of the other, when, putting forth all his strength, he planted a blow between the eyes of the actor, that gave him a very comical vision of two crossed rainbows, the ends of which were most singularly tied together. Down he fell like a bullock in the same instant, and his prompt enemy jumped upon him, and twining his little finger in the locks of the fallen man, prepared to thrust his thumb into his eyes. “Touch my eyes, man, and I put you to death as sure as a catastrophe,” exclaimed Horsey, characteristically, as the effort of the other had brought him to all his consciousness. The fellow would scarce have heeded his threats, but by this time the vigorous arm of Vernon had grasped him about the middle, and flung him to the other end of the room. We have omitted the screams of the women, which were as loud as usual, and as rightly timed. Nor have we deemed it necessary to say that old Yarbers—a fellow almost overcome with fat— offered sundry expostulations to the course of his companion, which, however, as he never hurried to enforce them, were as little heeded by the fierce young rustic as were the screams aforesaid. The effect of Vernon's movement was more obvious. The youth glared now upon him and now upon Horsey, who had taken advantage of the interval to recover his feet, as if doubtful which to attack. His hesitation resulted from no want of hostile feeling, but simply from the consciousness that there were two to contend with now; and one of them, however easy he found it to trip the heels of the other, had convinced him that the play in his case could never be all of one side. While he stood glowing and glaring, Vernon, like a man satisfied that he had done all that was required, resumed his seat, and with the assistance of the woman of the house, made such an acquaintance with its master, as suited the relation of guest and landlord. The good humour of Horsey did something to restore the quiet of the rest. “Young un,” said he, “you've bloodied my nose, and done it tolerably well, with some skill, but scarcely with sufficient firmness. That up and down blow, though it would fell an ox if hit squarely between the eyes, is a monstrous dangerous one if the enemy is watchful. It leaves your whole side exposed, all your ribs, not to speak of your diaphragm, a blow in which would make a fat man uncomfortable for life. You, sir,” turning to Yarbers, “you would find a blow in your diaphragm a singular inconvenience.” “Ay, sir, or any where else,” said the person addressed, with a good-humoured laugh, and scarcely knowing how to understand the strange creature who confronted him. “And now, Mary,” continued the actor, stopping the blood with his handkerchief, as it still continued to issue from his nose, “you were the cause, though the innocent cause, of this young rustic's incivility. You must help me to some water, that I may remove `this filthy witness from my hand'—and nose. `This is a sorry sight,' Harry. By the way, I must not forget to thank you, Harry, for taking that fellow's fingers from my eyes.” “If you don't mind how you talk, stranger, I'll put 'em there again,” said the other, his wrath duly increasing with the seeming composure and good humour of Horsey. “I hope not,” replied the latter, “as well for your sake as mine. Had you succeeded, my good fellow, in your first attempt, you'd have been, by this time, on the longest journey that you have ever taken in your life, and doubtful whether you'd have found easy ferriage across the river, unless your pocket is lined with more picayunes than I think it holds at present. What, my lovely Juliet, you have the water, have you?” “There's the piggin, Mr. Horsey, and here's the towel, sir,” said the damsel, whose sympathies for the hurts which he bore so good-humouredly, seemed to have made her less shy of him than she had shown herself at first. “So, you know my name already, chuck—a good name, Juliet—and your mother knew it many days before you, though I must have known you once. There—there's a spot still, my Juliet!” he exclaimed, as, having wiped his face, he placed the towel upon her hand, and before she could be conscious of his design, threw his arm about her waist and inflicted upon her cheek as unequivocal a smack as ever came from the hasty application of lip to lip. The young gallant was again in arms, but Horsey was ready for him, and the father, probably dreading that the latter would use some weapon in the strife, as he had already intimated, interposed his authority with sufficient promptitude to prevent the encounter. “If we don't get angry, Mr. Mabry, I wonder why should you? Besides, this gentleman's an old friend of Bess, and Mary's but a child to him.” “Not so fast—not so fast, old gentleman!” cried Horsey, who was considerably nettled at this imperfect sort of chronicling; “a child, indeed—a woman, a fine, lovely, ripe, bewitching damsel, this same Mary of yours. She's no more a child than I'm a grandfather. Now I come to think of it, there can't be much difference between us in age— not so much as to make a difference in any material respect. Let me see, she's about sixteen, and— egad, Mrs. Yarbers, it can't be more than fifteen years since I bought cakes from you at Hogler's and I going to Hugh Peter's school. I was only 13* ten then,—sixteen and ten—why do you talk of her being but a child to me? Count for yourself—sixteen and ten are twenty-six all the world over, except Connecticut, where, they say, it counts more— and I'll take Bible oath I'm not a syllable older. What say you to that, sir? There's no young woman of sixteen in Mississippi who, if she has any sense, will find fault with a man of twenty-six.” Vernon was amused at the pains which the actor took to vindicate his youth; and the result of his calculations seemed still farther to increase the annoyance of his rustic rival, who, after a little while spent in a condition of fever-heat, got up and left the room. He was followed by old Yarbers. Meanwhile, Horsey continued a playful chat with the mother and daughter,—his philosophy under his bruises seeming to commend him to additional favour, and both listening to him with pleased attention. But, catching the eye of Vernon, in the midst of one of his random speeches, he made him a sign, then rising, declared his intention to see what sort of night it was, and left the house. Vernon soon followed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Lycus. —That spark jealousy falling into his dry melancholy brain, had well near set the whole house on fire.Tharsalio. —No matter, let it work; I did but pay him in's own coin. —Geo. Chapman. “I am decidedly one of the best-natured mortals in existence,” said Horsey, when Vernon joined him in the little area in front of the cottage, “but there is something, Harry, in being knocked over, that would turn the sweet milk sour in the best of bosoms. I bore with this thing as patiently as possible while in the presence of the women folk, but my gall has been rising for the last half-hour, and I can stomach it no longer. It must out, and nothing will help me, Harry, but a clip or two at the muzzle of this same Master Mabry. You must stand by, and see fair play whilst I give him quits. Doubt not that I can do it, Harry. `I have the back trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.”' “It will make matters worse, Horsey. You were wrong in pressing upon the girl at first. She is something more than a child, and the customs of our country—” “I know all that, Harry, and had I not been a sort of chicken under the wings, at one time, of the good old clucking hen, her mother, I had, perhaps, never thought of kissing the girl; though by the divinity of Rosalind, there's justification enough in the lips themselves for the rashness of my pursuit. The guilt is equal between the tempter and the tempted. She who pouts a pretty mouth under one's nose can no more blame a body for snatching a civil kiss from the offender, than you can blame a hawk for stooping down upon a plump partridge that runs too freely from under the briars, and tempts the appetite it is yet unwilling to satisfy.” “You are supported in this notion,” said Vernon, with a smile, “by an authority no less moral than that of Dr. Johnson, who says that if you tempt a man you do him an injury, and if you overcome him you share his guilt. His view is also sustained by the decision of an English justice, who once committed the master to prison for laying money in the servant's way, and at the same time discharged the servant who stole it.” “'Gad, Harry, those were wise fellows. If I had known so much could be said in my favour, I had not stopped short at a single kiss. That man, Johnson, didn't he once write a play?” “Yes,—a tragedy—” “I'll read it—a devilish clever sort of fellow. A fellow that knows so well how to justify a kiss, must have made a very amorous piece of business of it. Wasn't it so, Harry?” “Nay,—quite the contrary, I believe. The play was rather a cold performance,—the author was a phlegmatic. It does not follow, you know, that a good judge is a good performer; and to kiss a pretty woman is a movement of one's blood rather than his thought—an instinct, not a reflection. But—to return to our subject. You can gain but a paltry satisfaction, Mr. Horsey, by punishing this young man; and I should say, judging from mere appearances, that he is too stout for you. He has more brawn and muscle, and though not so tall is a much heavier man.” “You shall see, Harry. I have what he has not. I have the trick of fence, and I have played long enough with muffles to venture a little upon the bare mutton. The stage is no bad school for acquiring agility of motion in foot and fist—a keen eye and sudden thrust makes me more than a match for this pudding-headed fellow, as I shall convince him no less than yourself, when I have laid eyes on him for awhile. Here is the path which I saw through the window. They made for yonder thicket, where, I reckon, we shall find them.” “I will stand by you,” said Vernon, with recovered gravity, “and see yo through with this business, but while we keep together, Mr. Horsey, I trust, for my sake, you will provoke no more difficulties. I have some right to expostulate with you, I think, as you have constituted yourself my companion, not merely without my desire, but against my wish. My objects in this country are such as might suffer material detriment from any collision with the people.” “Pshaw, Harry, my dear boy, `still harping on my daughter,' still at thy old `humours;”' replied the unthinking fellow. “It won't do, I tell you. Our objects are the same, though the range of character may be somewhat different; as I confess myself to be somewhat erratic, and a jump from Romeo to Dogberry has been a folly of mine more than once already. When you see me resolved, head and heels, to go on with you `to the last gasp with truth and loyalty,' why, what the devil's the use of shamming any longer? You can't get rid of me, do what you will, unless, as I told you before, you put a bullet through my brains, and that were only to scatter them worse than ever, without doing me or yourself any great service. Be generous, man—do as I have done, make a clear bosom of it, and we will down upon little Tilton with a concerted plan of operations which shall make the rascal stare. We can do as we please then with all the arrangements— get our own terms, declare our own casts, and— —`All furnish'd, all in arms, All plumed like estridges, that with the wind Bated like eagles having lately bathed: Glittering in golden coats—' By the way, Harry, you have not seen my dress in Hal. You shall see it to-morrow—you shall see me in it `rise from the ground like feathered Mercury'— made a d—d ugly hole in dad's crop to pay for that dress, I tell you. What would the old fellow say, were I to count up to him the cost of stars and spangles, beaver, crosses, images and plumes, in cotton bags. Ha! ha! I think I see him now, his game leg in air, his sound one thundering on the floor, his eyes shooting out from their spheres, red and fiery, and his voice hoarse and choking, still resolute to roar the anathema, which sticks in his throat, at last, more rigidly than a better sentiment in that of Macbeth. Oh, Harry, what a scene!— But hold!—Here's our enemy.” A bright moon helped the progress of the several parties. Yarbers and young Mabry stood in a small open space among a clump of pines apparently in earnest conversation, as the two approached them. Mabry held his horse by the bridle, one foot already in the stirrup, as if, the important matters of which they spoke being fairly discussed, he lingered only for a parting word. That they were seriously engaged was likely enough, since they neither saw nor heard the approach of the two strangers, till they had already passed into the same opening with themselves. It was then that Mabry, as if apprehending the object of his enemy, or, as was more probable, desiring an opportunity to renew a conflict in which his success had been so unequivocal already, withdrew his foot from the stirrup, and once more threw the bridle from his steed's neck over the stunted sapling which had before confined him. This done, he kept his place where the eyes of the two had first encountered him, while Yarbers, with some agitation of manner, advanced and addressed them. “A fine evening, gentlemen,—fine for a walk, and—” “Ay, or for any other purpose which needs a cool temperature and a clear sky;” was the ready answer of Horsey, who, at the same time passing by Yarbers, continued his speech to his companion— “I am glad this clear moon has helped me to find you, young un, since I should not have slept so comfortably with the thought of being your involuntary debtor. I bear, sir, some tokens of your favour on my cheek. I am not willing that you should go unrequited. Do you understand me, sir?” This apostrophe did not seem at all ungrateful to the rustic, who had rather hoped than expected so early an opportunity to renew his punishment of an offence which he had shown himself so unwilling to tolerate, and which had been repeated so audaciously before his eyes. That he could punish the impudent stranger, he had no sort of doubt. His own physical prowess had been generally acknowledged among the young Spartans of the neighbourhood, and the sudden and easy overthrow of Horsey by his single blow, but a little while before, and the good-natured forbearance of the latter immediately after, had given him but a mean idea as well of the courage as of the strength of his opponent. That Horsey should, with open eyes and cool deliberation, come once more within his clutches, was no less satisfactory than surprising; and boldly confronting him, he answered his salutation in language that left little possibility of a reconciliation being effected by either of the bystanders, both of whom attempted a consummation which was so proper and desirable. Yarbers strove with Mabry, and Vernon, though to a far more moderate extent, with Horsey. He knew that the popular sentiment made the course of Horsey one of retributive justice only, and his first overtures being unsuccessful, he forebore renewing them, and patiently waited in silence the progress of events. Yarbers, also, after a while, gave up, as useless, the effort to mollify the champion on his side of the hill, and the parties at length stood fitted, both ready and anxious, to “feed fat the ancient grudge.” Nothing surely could have been more curious than the difference of mood which the two exhibited while in this position. Mabry, at first, like a young bull simply bent on mischief, approached his enemy with slow steps, his rising temper indicated only by occasional sudden jerks of the head, and a slight fitful stamping of the feet. A muttered growl escaped his lips at intervals, and his fists were clenched and opened alternately—his long fingers, the nails of which were quite as threatening as any other premonitory symptom of danger, being sometimes thrust upward, as if, of themselves, anxious to rend from their sockets the eyes of all who beheld them with hostility. Vernon regarded this threat as so unequivocal that he interposed, and insisted upon “an up-and-down, straight fight, fist, head and feet, but no gouging—no rough-and-tumble;” but this was to deprive the enemy of one of his most favourite weapons, and that which he meditated to use with more malignant efficiency in this strife than any other. “I fight as I please—according to my own fashion —and let him do the same,” replied Mabry. “If he's afraid of my fingers let him say so, and I'll let him off.” “Afraid of your fingers, you catamount!” exclaimed the actor with contemptuous scorn, and a coolness that was really edifying; “use tooth and nail, my good fellow, if you please, or if you can. Don't trouble yourself, Harry, about me,—'egad I'll swallow him, claws and all, though his scales were as rough and large as those of the biggest alligator that ever picked his teeth with a cypress on the banks of Pontchartrain.” “You will, will you?” cried the other, the foam gathering about his mouth, his teeth gnashing with rage, and his whole body in motion, like that of the bull, whose gradually accumulating fury, moves it from petty mischief to a destroving madness. He bounded from the earth, ran round his enemy, slapping his thighs with his hands the while, in the most savage fashion, and at length, with a whooping shriek, imitated from that of some wild beast of the forest, he threw a summerset, his feet aiming to strike the breast of the actor, who followed all his movements with eyes and hands in constant readiness. The preliminaries of Mabry had warned Horsey of the mode in which his attack was likely to begin, and for which he prepared himself. It must not be forgotten that Horsey was Yorkshire too—that is to say, he was quite as well accomplished in the arts of the forest-fighter as was his opponent—with the additional advantage of knowing other arts which were even of more avail in such warfare as the present. VOL. I. 14 The heels of Mabry were no sooner in the air, than the actor, sinking on his knees, removed the mark which they were meant to strike; but, rising the moment after, he sprang to the spot where the other had alighted, and dealt him a blow between the eyes which gave him an apparition of the four moons of Jupiter, with a very fine display of crossfires playing in the centre, such as never yet blessed the vision of Herschel or Dick. This tumbled him over for an instant; but, nothing daunted, though confounded, he renewed his attack in a different form, and with a caution which had been more advantageously exercised in the first instance. The actor, no ways elated, but seeming to regard the proceeding so far, as one which had been the result of the plainest calculation, calmly approached his enemy, speaking as he did so, apologetically, as it were, to the two spectators for continuing the fight. “Blow for blow is quite enough in all ordinary cases; but this fellow tumbled me unawares, and in the presence of the women, and, by the valour of Orlando, he shall have another fall, ere our accounts balance. This I have sworn to, Harry,—as firm an oath as if I had pressed my lips on the pocket Shakspeare. I will give the lad a lesson which he will remember whenever he has occasion to take his measure by that of mother earth. Are you ready, young un?” Once more they stood before each other,—the language of superiority which Horsey employed, goading his rustic opponent to a degree of ferocity which made him forget his hurts; and conscious of his superior strength, he rushed in upon the actor, employing no art, and only seeking to come to the close hug—the grapple of sinews—in which lay his chief and only hope. But Horsey had no disposition to gratify him in this desire. He well knew the danger to him of such an issue. Once closed with, his “cunning of fence” would avail him nothing; and once down, his eyes had no farther security against the long claws which had already been stretched out to pluck them forth. It was fortunate, perhaps, that the rage of his enemy deprived him of his deliberation. His blind attack was not dangerous. His approach was met with cool, keen-eyed determination—a characteristic in which Vernon never could have conceived his companion to have been so strong. Talking all the while, and quoting as much Shakspeare as ever, he parried the blows of the rustic, for awhile utterly forbearing to put in any of his own. At length, as if he had yielded a sufficiently fair time to his opponent's play, he exclaimed— “Now, sir, is my turn. I will close up your eyes, without putting you to sleep; though, let me tell you, it would be very easy for me to do that too.” “I don't fear you, d—n you—I'll down you yet!” roared the other in a rage of fury that increased with every failure of his own efforts. “Your right eye first!” said the actor, answering this ebullition at the same moment with word and blow; “and now your left!” Both blows took effect, in spite of the desperate efforts of the victim to defend himself, and he lay at the feet of his foe almost without motion. Yarbers assisted him to rise, but he was in no condition for farther conflict. Blinded and staggering he stood, and still his lips breathed nothing but defiance. “The fellow's game,” said Horsey. The voice, the words, roused the instinct of hate anew in the vanquished man, and he struggled in the arms of Yarbers to rush once more upon his foe. Restrained in this, his hand suddenly plucked a spring-knife from his bosom, the blade of which was instantly shot out, and, but for the timely grasp of Vernon, he had sheathed it in the body of the man who held him. The weapon, spite of his struggles, was taken from him, and a stupor which followed, seemed to possess his mind and body with equal apathy. He murmured incoherently while it lasted, his words consisting mostly of bitter denunciation, which, to the surprise of the two travellers, seemed chiefly to fall upon Yarbers. “Your villains, John Yarbers—you would shut my mouth up—wouldn't have me tell what I know— and have made your villains do this. But I will speak—I'll write it down—I'll declare your roguery to all Madison. They shall know who—” “He raves!” exclaimed Yarbers in no little agitation; “you've beat all the sense out of him, Mr. Horsey, and he don't know what he says. But don't you mind him. Go home at once. Bess is waiting supper for you by this time, and there's no need that you should wait. I'll tend to him, and see him carried home.” “I'm truly sorry I had to thump him so hard, Harry,” said Horsey apologetically to his companion, as they took their way back to the cottage, “but I had sworn it, you know, and couldn't so well get off. Besides, it's absolutely necessary now and then to make an example of these fellows. They rely on superior strength to be insolent, and nothing would have pleased this chap so much as carrying home my eyes as a trophy. Years hence he would have a history for Dick Jenkins, and Jim Dobbins, and Peter Pinchback and a dozen others, of the dandy from below that he met at Yarbers' house, and `how he caught,”'—imitating the patois of the country—“`how he caught the chap mighty soptious with the gal, and how he gin him the cross-buttock, and, before he could say Jack Robinson, had a finger in his shock and a thumb in his eye, and sent him off with the blind-staggers and two holes in his forehead that could make no use of specks, though he was mighty glad to wear them;' and then, to prove the truth of what he said, he would bring forth a bottle of eyes preserved in whisky—my eyes with fifty others, the Tom's, Dick's, and Harry's, the Ned's, Ben's and Peter's, the Billy's and Timothy's, that have been the heroes of the barbacue and gin-shop from time immemorial—all in attestation of the superior excellence of the claws that plucked them out. The eyes of Tom Horsey preserved in whisky! Whew! The thought makes me shudder again. Eyes, Harry Vernon, are absolutely necessary to an actor.” “Keep yours about you as a traveller. You have made an enemy of this youth, who will not forget you. We travel in a wild region, and the securities are few for life and limb. A man may be tumbled in these swamps, and the wildcat alone will find out his hiding-place. You, who have no sort of reason to be in this neighbourhood, cannot too soon take yourself out of it.” “To-morrow, Harry—you would not have me set off to-night?” “No—to-morrow will be time enough. Return to Raymond, set yourself in safety and your father's mind at rest.” “`Ha! ha, boy! Say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?' Now hear me, Harry Percy, I look on it that you fear me—I hold thee jealous of my attributes, my attitudes, my carriage, my certain something, which, being peculiar to the individual man, is vulgarly called genius. I will outshine thee before Jim Tilton—outdo thee—take the rag off the bush in Benton; and leave thee `the mere lees to brag of.' You give me counsel but no confidence,— 14* why should I keep terms with thee? Urge me again upon this matter, and I declare against thee. Thou shalt know me as a rival rather than an ally; and I will foil all thy best points with my own. Look to it, Harry,—the gall rises within me.” Vernon regarded the speaker with mixed feelings of pity and vexation. But the monomania was too strong to be overcome by argument, or resisted by any thing short of violence—a measure to which, as there was no present necessity to rid himself of his companion, there was no occasion to resort. Suppressing, therefore, some stern expressions which had risen to his lips, he suffered the other to chuckle in the prospect of his theatrical superiority, inly consoling himself with the idea that before the close of another day he should be rid of his thoughtless but well-intentioned tormentor; and he, disabused of the unhappy error which had probably, more than any thing beside, seduced him from the home to which he had only just returned. When they reached the house, the actor resumed his random and rhapsodical chit-chat with all around him, as if nothing had happened either within or without to discompose him for an instant. The hostess he reminded of old times, and of a thousand practical jokes which he had played, of which she herself had been more than once the victim. With a fresh memory he accompanied the vital requisites of narration, lively comment, and felicitous gesture; and, speaking with all the frank exuberance of boyhood, which his playhouse habits had been rather calculated to increase than diminish, he had the satisfaction of seeing the blushing Mary watching and listening with an attentiveness scarcely less sweet and anxious than that of “the gentle lady wedded to the Moor,”—her white neck stretched forward— her head bent towards him—her lips slightly parted, and in her eyes that glistering eagerness of gaze which betrays mingled pleasure and curiosity. It is more than probable that the likeness between his own situation and that of Othello, forced itself upon him when he made this discovery, for a moment after, without any preface, he began half aloud to mutter the fine description of the scene— — “These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline,” &amp;c. The summons to supper, twice, thrice repeated by the hostess herself, scarcely succeeded in diverting him from this theme and stopping him in the full swell and torrent of his declamation. But the old lady was already handling the coffee-pot, and there was no time to finish the quotation; yet, as if to revenge himself for the interruption, he seized the hands of the damsel, who still sat, almost as inattentive to ordinary matters as himself, and gently pressing them the while, he conducted her to the vacant seat beside his own at the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Vot. You shall stand here, my lord, unseen, and hear all; Do I deal now like a right friend with you?Ans. Like a most faithful. Second Maid's Tragedy. Vernon retired early to his couch, which stood, with that of Horsey, in an adjoining shed-room. He was pleased to find clean white homespun sheets allotted him; and looking around the apartment, involuntarily congratulated himself that so tidy a damsel as Mary Stinson made up the beds and aired the chambers. Clear water in a clean white goblet stood on a chair—for there was no other washstand—on the back of which hung a couple of towels of coarse homespun, bleached by long use and good washing to a whiteness like that of the sheets. These little matters attested some larger degree of civilization than the externals of the mansion had prepared him to expect; and were the fruits, most probably, of better days and associations, which Mrs. Yarbers had brought with her from the lower country. Certainly they were only becoming features in one who had traded so long in cakes and beer to the common satisfaction. Yarbers himself appeared to be a slovenly, coarse creature, to whom the neatness of a household was not likely to be an early subject of consideration. It was fully an hour after Vernon had retired before Horsey followed his example. He sat up talking with the hostess, to whom his sudden re-appearance after so long an interval had brought back as many associations as her ancient features had awakened in him; and the ball of conversation, so busied were they mutually in asking and answering questions, was seldom suffered to fall for more than a single moment in all that space of time. It would be difficult to say whether the old lady took any special pleasure in the chat of the individual in question. It is more than probable she would have found the same in that of any other young person who had presented himself at the close of day, and begged a shelter for the night. Age likes to enliven itself with the fires of youth, as the venerable monarch of Israel became conscious of a living warmth from the embraces of the young maidens who were placed beside him for that purpose. It seems like the pouring of new mountain-streams into exhausted channels, and impelling into consciousness and motion the choked and stagnant fountains of life. The heart grows young in the contemplation of youth, and a momentary forgetfulness of its own decay is the consequence of that revivification of memory which confounds the past with the present; or rather, sends the mind back from the bleak eminence of age which it has reached, and where it stands stiff and frozen, to the green and flowery valleys below, from which it has risen at first, but to which, save by the aid of memory, it can never, never more return. There may have been, indeed, some little occult policy in the gracious demeanour of Mrs. Yarbers to the dashing and good-natured actor. She was not without that social instinct which is called cunning, and did not fail to recollect that Tom Horsey's father was one of the staunchest proprietors in all Hindes county. It had not escaped her eye that her old customer for cakes and beer was really very much taken with the appearance of her lovely daughter, and here, to use the phrase of the sea-logician was a “concatenation accordingly.” Perhaps, were it our cue to prosecute this inquiry still farther at this moment, it were not difficult to find strong sanction for the suspicion which is here presented to the mind of the reader; but this might be anticipating other passages. Enough to say, that Mrs. Yarbers was not pleased with her husband, with his relations, and her own position; and, as a mother, regarded the existing influences of the latter as highly detrimental to the fortunes of a child whom she loved, naturally and necessarily, as a mother should; but to whom she gave additional regard, as, contemplating her through the medium of her pride, she saw in her beauty a possession which lifted her heart, and warmed her vanity, and made it a sorrow in her mind when she reflected that such charms were destined to ripen in the shade, and, like the fruits of the untrodden forest, to ripen unprofitably without eye to admire or lip to taste. This was a subject upon which her mind was apt to brood, and it need not occasion wonder to be told that the instincts of one brooding thus, would not be unlikely to result in practices not very dissimilar to those of the professedly managing mother in communities of more artifice and fashion. From the first moment when Horsey declared himself and renewed his old acquaintance with her, the fancy had floated in her mind that his coming was a special providence; and this fancy, fixed firmly at last, she resolved to lend all her powers to the consummation of the thing she wished. With this resolution, Mary was suffered to sit up long beyond the usual hour, listening to a conversation which, enlivened by playful remarks and pleasant anecdotes on the part of the actor, was very agreeable to a young creature who had as yet seen nothing of the world; and the mother even assumed the performance of many of those tasks which in ordinary periods were commonly allotted to her daughter, that there might be no obstacle offered to the formation of an intimacy between the two which promised to realize her desires, and which, so far, had advanced with tolerable rapidity. The absence of her husband was favourable to her plans; and, it may be, that some impulse was derived for their provocation, from the fact that they were calculated to interfere with his. He, too, had purposes in view for the damsel—though not his daughter—which were something less than agreeable to the mother; and the open avowal of his preference in behalf of young Mabry had been the signal for her declared hostility to his pretension. Thus matters stood at the period of which we write. When Horsey retired from the hall, which he had not thought to do until Mary disappeared, and certain admonitory yawns from the mother denoted that condition of declining consciousness which could not long do full justice to his good stories and choice quotations, Yarbers had not returned. But Horsey had been but few minutes in his chamber before the outer door of the dwelling was heard to unclose and his heavy tread sounded along the floor. He had challenged his companion's attention the moment he entered the room, but the latter had discouraged him, by declaring a very carnal desire for sleep—an excuse which, at that moment, the buoyant actor was unwilling to regard as worthy a single consideration; and he rattled on without intermission for awhile, until, undressed and buried in the sheets, the animal obtained the ascendency, and his tongue, taking advantage of the circumstance, assigned the task of declaring his whereabouts to that distinguished member his nose, the extraordinary industry and capacity of which was soon a matter of general notoriety. To this moment Vernon had not closed his eyes. His mind was just in that condition of quickening cogitation when, yet unpossessed of its definite purpose, it compares plans, analyzes its resources and dependencies, and from pregnant and critical doubts conceives and gathers hopes and resolutions. There was much in the position of Vernon to keep him watchful, and the smallest unusual event was calculated to make his blood bound, and his fancy spring into activity. Thus, after Yarbers' return to the cottage, and while he meditated a thousand different courses of conduct for the better prosecution of his leading object, his ear, quickened by thought, under the influence of an imagination warmed and strengthened by the drowsy midnight horn that sounded throughout the world of silence, caught the sudden baying of a beagle, and a crowd of suspicious fancies thronged upon him. Once, twice, thrice, the loud, deep, prolonged note sounded faintly through the apartment, and then the footstep of Yarbers was again heard, slowly crossing the floor from the rear to the entrance of the house. The lifting of the latch followed, the door was opened, and again closed. Silence succeeded for a moment; then arose a stunning bay from the hound, almost at the threshhold of the dwelling, a prolonged note like that which had awakened the attention of Vernon a few moments before. This was singular enough. There were evidently no dogs of any kind about the premises at the first coming of the travellers, and though they might afterwards have come home with the master of the house, yet it was highly improbable that such had been the case, else wherefore had they seen nothing of them when they sallied forth to the meeting already described of Horsey with Mabry? Besides, it was scarcely possible that a farmer on the outskirts of the then Mississippi border, should so carefully exclude his dogs from the same apartment with himself. Vernon was in the mood to conjecture a thousand strange matters, and to convert into causes of suspicion many things that might be innocent enough. To one in his situation, and with his objects, this was sufficiently proper; and the occasion for his excitation in the present instance was well founded. The beagles that were in the wood then, run not on four legs; and the last sound that reached his ears, issuing from the lungs of Yarbers, was an annunciation to a companion that the coast was clear. Under the shade of a spreading oak, a hundred yards from his dwelling, he was joined by no less a person than our old acquaintance, Saxon. “You have lodgers, Jack?” demanded the outlaw in the first moment of their meeting. “Two chaps from below—one a quiet, sober, silent sort of person, the other a fellow all tongue. His name's Horsey,—he's—” “No matter. I know them both. As for Horsey, it's a misfortune he's along. He may be in the way. Hawkins put some nonsense in that fellow's head, and I fear has only thrust him in our path. The other must be seen to.” “Ha! What is he?” “A spy, I reckon. Such is our suspicion. He's in with the governor, and they have had some talk about an ugly business which concerns us. The only good feature in the thing is, that they do not know exactly which way to turn themselves, or who VOL. I. 15 to trust. What they know leads them to apprehend a great deal of which they know nothing, and much more than is the truth. What this youth knows is our question. We must touch his wallet. You must manage that to-night.” “Has he money, think you?” “Nay, that is no object now; besides, I doubt he has little. He is a poor young lawyer that the governor has tempted with promises of a great reward for every beagle that he can collar. Our object is to get hold of his papers, and see what names he has down. We know that certain papers of Mat Webber fell into their hands at that ugly business on the Black Warrior; and the confessions of that traitor, Eberly, if he made any, might give them clues enough to our most secret operations. That this fellow, Vernon, is employed by the state, I have no sort of doubt,—but there's no telling to what extent—what are the powers given him, or what is the object he aims at. These we must learn. His papers we must handle, and you must contrive it if you can to-night, or the work will be more troublesome to-morrow. Have you found out what course he takes?” “To Beatie's Bluff, if he himself is to be believed; but the other lark told Betsy a different story, and said that they were both for the lower ford, on the route to Benton.” “And how's Bess now—has she got over her humours? Does she still continue to suspect you?” “Worse than ever; and Mabry is also very troublesome.” “But have you not given him your daughter— will not that stop his mouth?” “It would, I make no doubt, could my giving be his having. But the old woman's stubborn as a mule, the girl herself dislikes him, and this evening there was a strange blow out, that has made the chap furious as a wild beast—all tongue and wrath, and no reason.” “Ha! what was the matter?” “Well, you see, it so happened, that the old woman know'd this young man, Horsey, when he was only a little bit of a boy, some where down on Pearl River. Well, when they struck up the acquaintance between 'em, what should the fellow do, but, to make it fast, he ups and goes for kissing Mary, and for any thing I know, the old woman too. Just at the time when he was about it, and pushing Mary, who was frightened enough, I warrant, all round the room, we came in, Mabry and myself; and before we could put in or say a word, Mabry jumps forward, and clips the stranger side of his head and tumbles him over like a log. There was a great to-do after that. The old woman set all the water in the house a-boiling, and it got quite too hot for Ned. He started off and I followed him, and while we were talking together under the trees, who should come up but these two fellows. Horsey followed to get satisfaction for the blow, which, it was surprising to me, he took so lightly at first. He thought better of it afterwards, however, and did better, for, I tell you, he handled poor Ned in two minutes in a way that's a caution. He downed him, a fair stupid down—Ned rolled about like a drunken bullock, and got mighty sick with both eyes shut up, and a great retching at his stomach. I had tight work to keep him steady on his nag and get him safely home. Since then, when he recovered, he's been in a mighty crooked humour. He swears that I don't want he should have the girl—that I'm only playing 'possum, and half believes that I set this fellow, Horsey, on to beat him, though nobody could have been more willing for the fight at first than Mabry himself.” “Does he threaten?” “A little squinting that way, though he don't speak out plainly. But he'd threaten and tell too, if so be he thought I was only shamming in the business with Mary.” “You must run it through then, as fast as possible. He will scarcely speak any thing to your discredit, if he was once married to your daughter.” “No! But that's the worry. The old woman's hot ag'in him. She thinks Mary meat for his master; and I do really believe she fancies to marry her to a colonel or some great lawyer, or maybe to a member of Congress. She always rides a high horse when she talks about Mary.” “But the girl herself?” “Likes him no better than Bess. He stands but little chance with either of them.” “But if Bess approved, would not that help his chance with Mary?” “Why, yes; but that's the swamp—worse than the Big Black—which I can't manage to cross no how.” “Why not make Mabry a colonel? The thing might very easily be done. You can beat up and bring in stray votes enough to turn the election, if the fellow could do any thing for himself. We must manage this matter hereafter. For this other fellow, now—” “Vernon?” “Yes,—of course you know which bed he sleeps in. Did you give an eye to his portmanteau?” “It's in the room with him—I put it myself by the chimney. You don't mean to—” Yarbers paused, and looked vacantly in the other's face leaving the sentence unfinished. Saxon smiled after a moment's hesitation, and replied— “You are afraid to have more work on your hands than was stipulated for. Be under no concern. We shall avoid blood-spilling and violence, as a general good policy, which is the more important to observe now when we are under partial suspicion already. All that we ask of you is to find out what he carries. You must get his papers; and this you can do, I trust, without difficulty. You have the old trap in the floor by which to enter, and this key will open any portmanteau-lock that was ever sold in Mississippi. As for his life, that is the least consideration so long as we know his game. There is more chance of Mabry growing troublesome than him, and you may yet find it necessary to work with cold steel upon him. Make him a colonel, and if that doesn't bring Brown Bess to favour him, we must bribe him to good breeding in another way.” “It'll be hard work. I never seed a fellow that set such store on a gal in all my life. He can't bear to see another man look upon her, and he talks of nothing else.” “Unless it be of you; but his case needs no immediate attention. This of Vernon does. Did you note whether his saddle had pockets?” “It has. I searched them already, but found nothing worth telling of. There was a newspaper, and some old accounts, I take it—they looked like bills and calculations.” “You cared not what they looked like, Yarbers, when you found that they did not look like money. But I must see those papers. Where is the saddle?” “In the stable. Shall I lead your horse round the old field? They may hear his footsteps if we take the path.” 15* “Right—do so. I'll await you at the stall.” Yarbers had put a tolerably fair estimate upon the papers found in the saddle-pouches. An examination of them by torchlight resulted in no discovery such as Saxon sought for, and the attempt to arrive at farther knowledge was devolved for the present upon the adroit and prying industry of Yarbers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns: please your highness To take the urgent here: come, sir, away.” Winter's Tale. Before this long conference was ended, sleep had overcome the limbs of Harry Vernon. The imagination which had so long kept him wakeful in spite of the day's fatigue, now busied itself only in his dreams, which were all of a kind natural to the young beginner on the weary paths of life. With a heart as yet unfettered, and a fancy free as that of the bird for the first time winging its way from the forests to the ocean, he was conscious only of that void and vacant region in his bosom, which is intended to be filled by love. The germ was there of the great empire over which the imperial master was yet to rear his wand, but the especial divinity had not bestowed a glance on the territory she was destined to inhabit. Warm and waiting for the advent, the heart of Harry Vernon did not yet repine in inconclusive fancies, hoping and sighing, and surrendering itself to imbecility. He suffered himself but little time to brood over the vague desires which he felt, but summoning to his side the thoughts which attend on duty, he addressed himself with ardour to the actual demands of existence, without yielding up more mind than was necessary to such as were eventual and prospective. It was only while he slept that his fancy gave itself up to the desires of his heart; and all the struggles before his pathway were thrust from sight, and all his duties and dangers forgotten, to give place to as lovely a vision as youthful bard ever conceived and young imagination ever desired. A maiden conjured up in realms of faery rose before his dreaming eye—just such a form as met and realized the ideal which his united taste and reason might have been disposed to create at a moment of particular inspiration. She was tall and graceful; her skin pure as marble and smooth as ivory; her eyes black and streaming with a melting light; her lips soft as the leaf and richer than the rose; her cheeks pale but radiant, almost transparent with a light like that which glistened from her eyes; and her forehead lofty, spiritually narrow, and shaded by the voluminous masses of silk-like hair, darker than that which shines on the shoulders of the raven. She stood beside him—such was his dreaming fancy—in a vision of his sleep. He had sunk for shelter beneath the shadows of a group of mighty oaks that surmounted the brow of a hill, and were surrounded by a dense and untrodden forest. His horse drank the while and cropped the herbage upon the banks of a little stream that wandered down the hillside, and lost itself in the deep groves of a thicket which hid from sight the dark and gloomy recesses of an inland swamp. The midday sun shone above him in melting fervour, but the dense foliage shielded him from the oppressive heat, and but a few strange straggling gleams, trembling and retreating as if conscious of intrusion, stole in at intervals between the branches, as they slowly yielded to the capricious wind. A dark shadow, as if from an overhanging cloud, suddenly overspread the scene the moment ere she entered upon it, but at her approach the cloud disappeared, a glory like that of the moon enveloped him with its soft, fleecy edges, and his very soul seemed to melt within him as the entrancing vision drew nigh to his side. Other forms followed and crowded upon the scene—strange events and mingling action disturbed its quiet, and his eye toiled in the survey of a thousand features, each changing at his glance and distracting his attention. But the lovely form which had fixed his eye and fastened upon his soul at first, was still to be seen amidst the crowd—now here, now there, nigh and then remote, but still present, hallowing the scene to softness, modifying the strife, stilling the clamour, and subduing the turbulence, until,—such was the strange fancy,—the sudden obtrusion of Horsey, and his fierce declamation, affrighted the delicate and ethereal beauty from the spot; and he started from his sleep with a harsher mood in his bosom towards his self-appointed companion than any which he had ever entertained before. It will be seen how far the random actor was answerable for the dispersion of his happy fancies. Horsey was not without his visions also; but they were of a very different character. When he first fell asleep, his nose performed such vigorous airs that Vernon was apprehensive lest they might greatly interfere with his own desired rest. But the mastery of this solemn member was disputed at frequent periods by his tongue; which, as if never needing rest, continued at intervals to pour forth choice fragments from his favourite Shakspeare, growling at one moment in all the emphatic terrors of the tragic muse; at another softening down to the most dulcet parts of love, the sweet significant nothings with which every hero regales his “Amaryllis in the shade.” These were long or short as the occasion seemed to require them; and the prompt and well-versed memory of the actor appeared never to want the auxiliary help of a quotation. Sometimes, the sentences would be broken, sometimes complete; at first, they were usually short, consisting of two or three consecutive words of a single phrase; but Vernon, who listened to him for awhile with smiling curiosity, observed, as the night advanced, that he rose from fragments to entire passages, and when he himself was sinking into that sleep which yielded him a vision so entrancing, he was conscious that the actor was gliding into the dialogue in which he personated the love-sick Montague, and wooed the fair Capulet beneath the window. Something Vernon caught ere he himself slept, of— “— strides the lazy pacing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air,” followed by an intense ebullition of the nostrils which probably answered all the purposes of a reply from Juliet; when he himself, surrendering to the oppressive sleep, lost all farther apprehension of the dialogue. But it was continued, nevertheless, by the actor, though so large a portion of his audience slept; and, perhaps, the interruptions from his nose allowed for, he never went through the part with more honest unction in his life. That he might have done better, or at least toiled for it, is unquestionable, if he could only have been told that at this moment his audience was increased. So it was. Saxon, the outlaw, and his adjunct Yarbers, stood without the dwelling and beside the chimney of the shed-room in which slept the travellers. Their ears took in with readiness the earnest and pleading devotions of the amorous Romeo, and so greatly did the affair tend to the amusement of the former, that he could with difficulty restrain himself from taking the opposite part of the dialogue, and thus stimulating the enthusiastic actor to increased efforts. But the more timid Yarbers was opposed to this, and, speaking in whispers, scarcely audible to his immediate companion, dwelt earnestly on the danger of discovery. “Pshaw, John Yarbers, the man sleeps—soundly too—no man sleeps more soundly than him who dreams of what he loves.” “But the other fellow—Vernon!” “Ay,—you have need of caution there; but I reckon he sleeps too. You must lift the trap cautiously and listen, before you do any thing.” This trap was simply a square hole in the floor, made by sawing two of the flooring-boards across, fastening them together by a cross-piece below, and securing them with common hooks to the joist beneath. While, therefore, their ends rested upon the joists, they resisted any pressure from above, and it was easy for one under the house, by undoing the hooks, to raise the trap and make his way into it. The fabric stood upon raised blocks, from three to four feet from the ground, and, obeying the direction of the outlaw, Yarbers fell upon his knees, and soon disappeared beneath it. It was easy to undo the hooks which secured the door, but the continued declamation of Horsey, in spite of all the assurances of Saxon that he slept, disturbed the nerves of the intruder, and he once more returned to the entrance to assure his companion that it was certainly Vernon who snored and Horsey who spoke; and that the speaking had none of the obstructions or hesitation of a sleeping man, and came most certainly from the throat of one as perfectly conscious as he ever was in daylight. The impatient outlaw answered him with an oath. “Yarbers, you are but a dry bone after all. Stand aside, and let me do it.” “Stay, sir—don't you hear steps? Don't you think he's walking?” “Pshaw, man! It's your own heart. It thumps hard enough to scare you, I doubt not. Where does the portmanteau stand?” “Right side of the chimney from the hall-door; and the saddle-bags on the left.” “But which is Vernon's?” “Fegs! I don't know. I warn't home when they come, and I s'pose they took 'em off the creatures themselves and brought 'em in. There's no telling which is which.” “That's unfortunate. We must then examine both,” said Saxon, as he crawled under the house and made his way to the still unopened trap-door. This he raised with sufficient care, though not without some little noise,—the hard, heavy pine of which the boards were made requiring that degree of effort in raising them which had been otherwise necessary to keep them in equilibrium and prevent the edges from grazing against the surrounding floor, to which they were made to correspond with tolerable nicety. Once lifted, the intruder, still grasping the door in his hands, raised himself and stood up within the opening, his head and shoulders being now within the apartment. The door he laid down gently upon the floor beside the trap, so that it might be drawn into its place on the first alarm. To his confusion, however, while thus engaged, he discovered that the conjecture of Yarbers was not unfounded. Horsey was certainly out of bed, and striding the floor of the apartment. His ruling passion had grown utterly ungovernable in his sleep, and the somnambulist was now fairly in the highest realm of hallucination. His movements were, however, slow enough at this period; and Saxon succeeded, without noise or interruption, in stretching forth his hand to the fire-place and securing the saddle-bags, which were the first that came within his reach. These he handed through the aperture to his comrade below, who proceeded to examine them in the moonlight without. His whispered words, as he looked at the contents, declared his own wonder, while they satisfied Saxon that he had fallen upon the wrong chattels. “Jackets and breeches all covered with gold and spangles.” “Stuff 'em back,” said Saxon, stooping down and whispering; “stuff 'em back and hand me the bags. They are the actor's baggage. We must grope for the other's.” While this was doing, and at the moment when Saxon had received them in his hands, and was about raising them through the hole in which he stood, in order to replace them, the paroxysm came upon Romeo stronger and less controllable than ever. A rush of inspiration filled his veins, and to the great annoyance of the outlaw, he heard him growling and advancing. The play had made rapid progress in the sleep of the actor. He had reached the fifth act,—he had got his poison from the apothecary—he had resolved upon his own death, and was hurrying on to give County Paris his. “Give me that mattock!” he cried in low, hoarse accents to the supposed Balthazar beside him. His voice then subsided into a throng of pressing whispers, as if forced to speak, yet not desiring to be heard. This brought him within a few paces of the outlaw, who began seriously to feel the inconvenience of his situation. A few strides more would bring VOL. I. 16 the actor upon his shoulders, and into the pit. To withdraw and let down the door at that moment, might be to arouse the sleeper, and defeat the object which he had in view; and no possible effort which he could make, short of rushing into the room itself, would enable him—this he discovered —to reach the opposite end of the fire-place where the valise of Vernon had been placed. While he stood in a state of incertitude, which prevented him from doing any thing, the passion of the actor had taken a new direction from the approach of Paris. He had gone through the paroxysms which made him beat down the walls of the monument; and here Saxon observed, with some surprise, that he now spoke the part of Paris as well as his own, to which, hitherto, he had entirely confined himself. The inference of the outlaw from this fact, was, that the pressure of sleep was passing off, the influence of imagination lessened, and that the actor's ear needed the absolute reality of sound, to continue any longer in his self-deception. This added somewhat to the apprehensions of the intruder, who was not suffered very long to speculate upon the matter. The language of Paris was threatening—that of Romeo had assumed a tone of mildness, which, in reality, only disguised the labouring volcano in his bosom. “`I beseech thee, youth, Pull not another sin upon my head, By urging me to fury.”' Still he approaches, and his arm rises as if balancing the sword. “Live,” he says, in most soliciting tones— “`Live, and hereafter say, A madman's mercy bade thee run—away.”' Here he availed himself of one of his own readings of the thousand unimportant distinctions in such matters, of which stage-struck citizens are so apt to make a fuss. Pausing at the word “run,” which he had spoken along with the whole passage in the gentlest accents, he now made a tremendous transition, and the final word, “away,” was thundered forth in tones to waken up the dead. This was a “point” upon which, in his waking moments, he was very apt to pride himself. The answer of Paris, which he also spoke, fell something short of this, but was still loud; and he had scarcely given himself time to finish it, before, reaching the acme of his paroxysm in the part of Romeo, he gave the torrent free vent, and leapt upon the shoulders of Saxon, while he cried aloud, “`Wilt thou provoke me?—then have at thee, boy!”' The situation was awkward in the last degree, and the struggles of Romeo were such as to convince the outlaw that he was rapidly coming to his senses. Exerting his whole strength, therefore, he seized the half-prostrate actor by his shoulders, and flung him from him as far as he might while in the place in which he stood, not giving much heed whether the poor fellow was brought up by flint or feathers. Then, suddenly sinking down with equal promptness and composure, he drew the trap into its place with a degree of ease which added but little to the bustle which the previous incident had occasioned. The direction given to Horsey by the arms of Saxon, carried him upon the couch of Vernon, whom the struggling actor, now emerging into actual bodily consciousness, grappled with as he was rising up in alarm, and continued to contend with as if County Paris still remained to be slain. But he met with no better treatment at the hands of Vernon than from those of Saxon, being tumbled, by a very unscrupulous movement, backward upon the floor, where he lay, for a moment, actually at a loss to determine where he was and what was his condition. Vernon had been as roughly awakened from a pleasant dream as the actor, and, still in doubt as to whence the annoyance arose, he was soon out of bed and standing above Romeo, the moment he had flung him from him. What might have been his farther act had not Horsey spoken, though doubtful in character, would have been certainly decisive. The tongue of the latter, never for any length of time idle, happily resumed its offices in time to prevent more mischief. “Why Harry, my dear boy, is that you? Why what the devil's the matter?” “Matter, Mr. Horsey. That's the very question to be asked of you. How came you on my bed?” “Your bed! Was that your bed, Harry? By all that's sacred in stage lights, I took it for the tomb of Juliet; and Paris—you were Paris, my dear fellow.” “Do you walk in your sleep, Mr. Horsey?” asked Vernon, now beginning to conjecture the whole affair. “Egad, it may be. I don't know, but, certainly, I have had a strangely exciting dream. It was our first night at Benton, Harry. I was Romeo, and that dear little Mary made her debut in Juliet, under my instructions. If I ever play so well in reality, as I fancied I played this night,—as I must have played in my sleep,—I shall ask for nothing better. But, (rising from the floor as he spoke,) my shin is cursedly bruised,—the skin's off; I can hardly get up. I had some notion that I had got into a hole, but—” The voice of Mrs. Yarbers at the chamber door, demanding to know if any body was sick, and asking the cause of the uproar, silenced the actor. After satisfying her, he was very glad to slink back into bed, as he found Vernon unwilling any longer to listen to his description of the scene, and the detail of points newly-made, which had broken in upon fancies of his own no less dear and exciting, though, possibly—it was his own reflection—not more real and stable than those of his companion. Saxon was no less annoyed, and, perhaps, with more serious cause for annoyance, than those within. He waited long without the house, and near his place of secret ingress, in the hope of hearing those sounds from the sleepers which should assure him of an uninterrupted entrance. But he waited in vain. Whether it was that the rough handling which Horsey had received had utterly expelled the nightmare, or whether he had become conscious of the unreasonableness of making any more disturbance in the house, and was willing to compensate for his excesses at one moment by an unusual degree of forbearance at another, he certainly did not snore again that night. Vernon's was a well-bred nose, that seldom violated the rules of decorum; and hopeless of the plan, the progress of which had been so forcibly interrupted in the first instance, the outlaw concluded to defer to another opportunity his intended purpose. “We must do it on the road side; and it may be necessary that we should even lay hands on him. These papers being of value he would most probably conceal about his person. It is barely possible that they should be in the valise, and we should take no 16* such risks as this on the strength of a bare possibility. We must keep your house in the reputation of being an honest one, Yarbers, as well to serve our purposes as to please your wife. Let her not know that I have been here to-night. I will go farther up, and be ready for our man at the fork.” “She'll guess fast enough though I don't tell her. She's mighty 'cute, and knows the bay of the beagle is not for nothing in these parts.” “So long as she can't see the beagle, and don't know whose name's on the collar, she knows nothing. But help me to my horse, while I ride. Jones will be here by daylight, I suppose. You can send him after me when he comes.” “And Mabry?” “If he blab, he must be silenced. If the mouth won't be sugared it must be stopped. You will see him to-morrow when he is a little cooled off from the drubbing of this actor, and persuade him that you have nothing to do in the business. This he will be the more apt to believe when he finds his enemy gone; and, perhaps, it might be just as well that you should see him at an early hour on the subject. Should nothing answer—should he grow troublesome—I will send a decoy-beagle who will get him into Cane Castle, where he'll leave all his secrets before he comes forth.” “There was one here for you to-day from Cane Castle—Stillyards.” “The Hunchback! well, what said he?” “He came from Monna.” “Ah! she's impatient—but she must wait. She would fetter me, Yarbers, as Brown Bess fetters you, but that my blood is quite as quick and impatient as her own. Yet, she's a woman more to be feared than Bess. She can't scold so well—nay, she seldom scolds, but she thinks and broods over her thoughts, which are sometimes fearful enough, and one day she may seek to act them. She's secret, Yarbers, and there she is unlike Bess, who would blab every thing she knew to your hurt if you once put her into a passion. Monna, if sometimes fearful as the grave, is at all times as secret. It would be twenty times our good, Yarbers, were your wife half as secret. But you took her for better or worse, and so must we. If you are satisfied with your bargain,” speaking with a malicious smile, “your friends have no reason to complain.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “The confidence of youth our only art, And Hope gay pilot of the bold design, We saw the living landscapes * * * * Reach after reach salute us and depart.” Wordsworth. The travellers prepared to set forth at an early hour on the ensuing morning. The adventures of the night had tended somewhat to sour the usually sweet temper of the actor. His legs, which he displayed to the wonder and commiseration of his companion, were skinned from knee to ankle, in a way perfectly mysterious to the sufferer, who could not conceive how such an affliction could have arisen simply from his playing Romeo to empty boxes. “And yet it seemed to me, among other things, that it wasn't Romeo, neither, but Hamlet. I was in the grave, grappling—I'll be sworn upon it—with Laertes, with whom I `fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.' It must have been in the grave that I got these bruises.” That imperfect state of mind which, in dreams, so happily unites the fanciful with the actual, had, in fact, produced a rapid transition in his thoughts from the one play to the other, while his involuntary struggle in the hole with the outlaw suggested a similitude of circumstances so favourable for a change of scene; and the dawning of his right reason, which the struggle necessarily occasioned, forced upon him the partial conviction that some other man, of considerable brawn and muscle, had, like himself, been dreaming a part also, which had given the performance a termination so perfectly tragical. His inspection of his saddle-bags contributed in some little degree to his confusion. The contents were in strange disorder. “Could I have been so d—d stupid as to have dressed myself in costume? I don't recollect putting it back, and if I did, I must have shown a singular indifference to Romeo's wardrobe to have put it up without folding. Look here, Harry Vernon, what a bunch I've made of it in my sleep; a bag from a beggar's press—and the garment perfectly new—a splendid garment, for which that skunk of a tailor amerced me in a greater number of dad's dollars than I should be altogether willing to count up in his hearing. You shall see me put it on. You shall— you shall form an idea of the sort of chap that C—dwell quarrelled with;—you shall see the figure, at least, of a Romeo not to be met with every day.” This scene was going on in the chamber prior to their appearance before the family in the hall. They had been already summoned to an early breakfast, which Vernon, before retiring for the night, had especially solicited. He now ventured to remind the actor that the family and breakfast waited upon them. “Only a moment!” exclaimed the actor hurriedly, as he proceeded to envelope himself in the glittering garment of the amorous Montague—“only for a moment! It's worth a glance from a veteran stager. Ha! what's this?—a hole! a rent!” The exclamation of the actor, distinguished by tones expressive not merely of surprise, but consternation and horror, drew the attention of Vernon to the dress, in which an envious nail—probably while old Yarbers was inspecting the glittering sack beneath the house—had torn a finger's breadth. “What the d—l shall I do?—what a misfortune!” exclaimed the actor, with a degree of concern infinitely greater than any that his bruised shins had occasioned. “It's but a small hole: it's easily mended,” said Vernon. “Small!” exclaimed the actor, with some indignation. “Ay, ay, not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but 'tis enough to call for the instant succour of a darning needle. Juliet, that is to say, my little Mary, here, shall take it up off hand. She's a nice, handy body, that; would make, with training, an admirable Juliet—'gad, 'twould be a charity to give her lessons, and I'll think of it. But to the Romeo—she shall take up the rent in the twinkling of an eye.” “Surely, Mr. Horsey, you will not delay us for so small a matter.” “Small a matter, indeed! By St. David's best buckles, Harry, you have a strangely irreverent way about you! Such a rent in Romeo's body is no small matter. Let the audience see a hole in a hero's breeches, and d—me if it don't turn all his tragedy into farce. I once saw a chap named Barnes playing Lear, with his shirt—an ugly corner of it, I mean— depending, for all the world like a streamer, fully a quarter of a yard from his inexpressibles. The audience roared with admiration, which Barnes took for applause. Never did a fellow play so furiously fine—with so much earnestness and enthusiasm. But the more fire he put into his acting, the more it filled them with laughter; all of which he mistook, like an ass as he was, for pleasure at his performance. On a sudden, however, he happened to fling his left hand behind him, in order to adjust his sword, and he grasped along with it the obtrusive garment. You never saw a fellow's comb cut so short off. He lost his voice in an instant—his head dropped, and when he came round to the wing, the sweat stood upon his brow like treacle. No, no! I am clear that no man should make his bow to the public with a hole in his breeches.” Vernon expostulated against the delay, but in vain. A new measure suggested itself to his companion. “While her hand's in at one thing, she can do the other, or I'll do it myself. I'll get Mary to heat me an iron, and I'll smooth it before I start. It's ruined for ever if I put it back in this condition.” Vernon saw that expostulation and entreaty were alike vain. Horsey made a point of healing Romeo's hurts—the ruling passion rendering him equally obstinate to argument and entreaty; and with a complacency as enviable in the eye of a traveller as it is desirable in that of an actor, he sallied from his chamber with the fractured garment in his hand, and proceeded instantly and without circumlocution, to declare his requisitions to mother and daughter. “Get your needle, my little Juliet, and show me what sort of a workman you are; but first put me an iron to warm; I must take out these wrinkles.” The girl willingly assumed the performance of the task set her, and Horsey sat down the while to breakfast, but his eyes were upon her as she sewed, and more than once he started up to look at her progress. “Well enough done, Mary. You are the girl after my own heart. Egad, if my wardrobe suffers much more injury in this fashion, I shall not be able to do without you. I shall have to come and steal you from mamma. A stitch or two more just there, Mary, if you please; and now that I look at it, just beneath the arm I see that a thread has dropped. The garment is rather tight over the shoulders, and it is only a timely precaution that would guard against the strain of any great action in that quarter. A man's blood gets up wondrously, Harry, when he's in the fury of a fifth act—when he's warmed by opposition, and, more than all, by his own rising consciousness of what is called for by the character. At such a time his action increases accordingly, and it would be the most awkward thing in the world, if, extending his arm to convey the idea of command, to order Buckingham's head off, or any matter of equal tragic signification, he should discover to the inquisitive audience a rent under the arm, and a glimmer of a white cotton shirt beneath his buckram. It's the easiest thing in the world to upset the gravity of an audience in the deepest scenes. One fool makes many, and the first booby that laughs out, without any fear of shame, finds a hundred followers. I've seen it a thousand times, and know there is nothing so tragic as will frighten farce. Farce follows tragedy as naturally as the sparks fly upward. She stands beside her, ready to grin at the first opening; and let dignity forget herself for an instant, she claps her hands, and darts in, without any regard to decency, before all the spectators.” Thus rambling on, the actor ate his breakfast, and watched the progress of Mary with her needle. The bright eyes of the girl laughed the while, and her cheeks blushed, when he hung over her; his glances being equally shared between the sempstress and the garment. The breakfast over, Vernon, with some consternation, beheld him proceeding to assist the mother and daughter in removing the plates and dishes in order to convert the table into a tailor's board, on which he could perform the last-needed office of smoothing out the rumpled Romeo. Old Yarbers looked on with a scarcely-suppressed smile, which was not lessened as the actor confessed to having disordered his wardrobe in his night-errant habits. He could have told a truer story, and have accounted more truly, if not more rationally, for the condition of the saddle-bags. But he was prudent enough to conceal his knowledge, and suppress, though with difficulty, his laughter. The actor had made a clean breast, and declared the true cause of the uproar of last night to the family. There was nothing retentive in his nature, unless it might be in the one purpose of his mood; and prattling ever, like the downward running fountain, his streams, the deeps and shallows alike, were equally open to the sunlight. Harry Vernon, meanwhile, became impatient to the last degree. Not that he had any reason to wait for Horsey, beyond that of mere civility. He well knew that, before the day was out, they would reach the spot where diverging roads should prove convincingly to the actor that his course was other than that which he had so precipitately and erroneously assumed to be the same with his own. To hurry off before his companion was ready, in order that he might anticipate this truth, would at least seem rude, if it were not so in reality; and then the utter simplicity and good nature of the actor pleaded in his behalf, and made Vernon, who was generously and nobly constituted, reluctant to do any thing which might inflict unnecessary pain, even though he well knew that a nature so mercurial as that of Horsey would not feel it long. Resolved, therefore, to await the actor's pleasure, he sat resigned to his fate, and beheld him removing the hominy, the remnants of the bacon and eggs—the mother, father and daughter, equally, and in vain, VOL. I. 17 striving to prevent him from performing duties so seemingly inconsistent with the dignity of a gentleman and the position of a guest. But his activity set their exertions at defiance. Plate followed plate, and dish dish, and cup cup, without stop or stay, until, striving to sweep up in one common effort the remaining odds and ends, he grappled them quite too unceremoniously together, and, to his own horror, and the great reddening of the hostess's cheeks, they came in undistinguishable ruin to the ground. “Bless my soul, Mrs. Yarbers, but what have I done? I have broken all your cups and saucers.” “No! never mind, Mr. Horsey,” stammered the old lady, half angry with her old favourite, yet doing her utmost to conceal her annoyance. “It's very unfortunate. I certainly had 'em fast, my dear madam. I could carry twice as many. I'll show you now, I'll bring back, in two turns, all that I have carried to the shelf;” and he actually proceeded to restore the plates and dishes to the table—“and if I break so much as a teacup, I'll give my head for a football. It was certainly the strangest misfortune.” Vernon interposed. “Certainly it was, Mr. Horsey—a sort of fatality which can no more be accounted for than helped. All that you can do is to send Mrs. Yarbers a fine set from Vicksburg or Natchez, and take care to meddle with no more cups and saucers. The table is ready for you now—why not smooth the garment?” “True, true, my cousin of Vernon, that is a good thought; and Bess—hold me your debtor for a set of china, the best that money can get in Natchez. Nay, nay, I will have no refusal—it must be so. You shall have the cups and saucers; I swear it by my Romeo, which stands waiting for smoothing. Let me have the iron, Mary,—nay, don't burn your pretty fingers with it—let me have it.” “It's hot, Mr. Horsey. Better take it up with the towel, sir,” said the girl. But the rapid actor had already grasped the iron at the fire, with a rapidity only exceeded by the haste with which he dropped it again; and he now stood blowing his fingers, his face red as a lobster's with the sudden pain, and his mouth puffing and speaking alternately. “Hot as—phew! phew!—the skin's off fingers as well as legs. Phew! Harry, my dear fellow, what an accident! Ay, do, Mary, that's a dear girl—do you iron it for me. Let your iron lie smoothly, Mary, my dear, and take care that it doesn't scorch Romeo as it has scorched me. That blue is very perishable —phew!—the misfortune of all things that are very beautiful. There, there—I think that will do. It must do. I won't worry you to work for me any longer, my sweet Juliet. Mrs. Yarbers, why didn't you call your daughter Juliet, instead of Mary?” “As well might Mrs. Yarbers ask why you were not called Romeo, instead of Tom, Mr. Horsey. The one question might be answered just as readily as the other. But time presses on me, if not on you, and if you are disposed to stop until you have revised all the Christian names in the county, there is certainly no good reason why I should linger to assist you.” “Right, Harry,—there's right and reason in what you say. Mrs. Yarbers, the best friends must part —you shall hear of me soon, and see me again when I have got through my business above. Mary, my dear, you shall be my Juliet,—nay, don't look down —I tell you it shall be so. There shall go an oath to it that shall bind one of us, at least; and unless Mr. Mabry steps between us both—ha! so you turn away—you do not like that,—well, I like you the better that you do not; and so good-bye. `It is a grief so brief to part' with thee. Come, Harry Vernon, I am ready now.” The actor had prolonged the parting words and moments to the last possible limits, and somewhat to the surprise of Vernon, he saw, or fancied he saw, an expression of seriousness and interest, rather beyond that of his ordinary manner, conspicuous in what he said and looked to the lovely forest damsel. Nor, on the other hand, did it seem to Vernon that the girl was entirely without some consciousness of the interest which she occasioned, and that which she felt, for her little rosy lips quivered as she spoke to them at parting, and the “good-bye” trembled in imperfect expression upon her scarcely opened mouth. Mrs. Yarbers was pleased to assure both the travellers that nothing would gladden her more than to see them often; a compliment which she then repeated to Horsey in particular; and one, in approbation of which, her lord and master growled out certain confirmatory, but scarcely intelligible, sentences. For a brief space after their departure from the hovel, the spirits of Horsey seemed considerably depressed. He said but little, and that little with the air of a man who speaks rather to avoid the imputation of sullenness, than with any desire to please. When he did speak more freely, and with the gradual assumption of his former mood, his expressions revealed the true source of his solemnity. “There is something monstrous uncomfortable at parting, Harry, even with acquaintances of yesterday. I don't get over it for an hour or two. It seems to me like rooting me up, and tearing off some of my leaves and branches, when I am compelled to grapple hands only to cast them loose again. It's true it don't make me sick—for that matter I shouldn't go to bed, I believe, or lose stomach for a dinner, if I was to be separated for ever from the best friends in the world. I should only, if that were the case, take a pine torch in my fingers, and go about looking after others; and a newer set might soon console me for the lost. But it seems to weigh me down,—my limbs grow weakish, and I lose all desire to make any exertions and scarcely care to say or hear any thing, though the best passage offered itself for quotation, jump to the moment, from Billy Shakspeare, that High Treasurer of all manner of spoken jewels. Now I feel just so in leaving these good people. It's true Brown Bess is an old crony. I know nothing about her husband, who seems but a curmudgeon; but that dear little creature—that Mary—don't you think her devilish handsome, Harry? What a forehead she has! what lips, eyes, hair! A very collection of beauties! Celia, Rosalind, and Helen, melted into one; and yet, Harry, she did not speak twenty words to me the whole time she was present.” “How could she—who can, Mr. Horsey?” replied Vernon, laughing, “you out-talked the whole family.” “The lawyer, also. By my faith, Harry, but that I heard you make a long and good speech at Raymond, I should be inclined to say you had taken up the wrong profession. Now I should have been the lawyer.” “You mistake. You would soon ruin yourself as a lawyer. You would soon talk yourself away. A lawyer's words are the materials he works with,— you would soon dull them, or wear them out. Your talking lawyer is a profligate who cheapens his own wares by making them common. To talk in the right place is his art, no less than to talk to the purpose. 17* The where, and the when, and the how much, are the three grand requisites of public speaking.” “Egad, if that be the case, Harry, I should be soon swallowed up; for, as to stopping to think when I should speak, and what I should say, that would seem to be the most idle, as it would certainly be, in my case, the most impracticable thing in the world. For that matter, I don't know half the time that I'm talking, even when my tongue is most busy `beating all the chimes of Westminster.' I catch myself, every now and then, speechifying of my own head, or giving a reading from Shakspeare to pine trees and gray mosses, wasting myself, as the rose does its sweetness, upon the desert air, when I can get no better audience. Such, I trust, will not be our fate at Benton, however, if Tilton has any skill in management, and the Yazooians any taste. By the splinters, you shall see how I shall drive; nay, there's no good reason why I should not give you a sample now. Here's a quiet spot—looks for all the world as if it was meant for such a purpose. There is a space on the brow of the hill which would accommodate a thousand people, and the pines rise, and the oaks spread above and around it, and the vines link them together and fill up the space between; so that the amphitheatre of the Romans was never so compact, and not half so well covered. And, in the woods, with green leaves around me, my voice seems to have a volume and a clearness that I cannot always command in a building. Ride up with me for a minute, and you shall see as good an imitation of Forrest—did you ever meet with Forrest, Harry? A splendid, half-savage-looking fellow —a sort of Mark Antony before dinner—who, by the way, would make a figure in Dryden's Antony, perhaps superior to any who has yet tried it. But I will show you Forrest in Damon,—you shall have the strangling scene—I'll choke a pine sapling for Lucullus—I'll—” He commenced riding up the hill as he spoke, but Vernon stopped him. “I ride on, Mr. Horsey. I would not now stop to see Forrest himself.” “The d—l you wouldn't.” “No, on my soul I wouldn't.” The actor stared. “Harry Vernon, you are a bundle of mysteries. How can it be that you love the stage?—nay, how can you yourself play with any hope of success unless you are willing to behold the best models?” “Your remark reminds me of the error under which you have laboured so long and under which you still labour;” was the reply of Vernon expressed in looks equally grave with his language. “I will not ask, Mr. Horsey, by what means, or by whom, you became possessed of the idea that I entertained a passion for the stage and had resolved to go upon it. It is enough that such is your delusion, entertained in spite of my earnest and repeated assurances that such was not my intention—that I had no such passion, and that I was already earnestly and irrevocably bound to the pursuit of another profession—one of the most jealous as the most absorbing —which will suffer neither rival nor interruption. With a most unbecoming resoluteness you refused credence to my own assurances to this effect, and have appointed yourself my travelling companion, without knowing how far I desired company, or whether your presence might not somewhat interfere with the object of my pursuit. It has not been through your forbearance, Mr. Horsey, that it has not done so, and I trust you will believe me when I tell you that it has been with me a serious fear that such might be its effect. Finding you possessed with this strange notion, and having exhausted all my forms of speech in seeking to convince you that I was no actor, and did not intend to become one, I forebore—in consideration of your parents, who have treated me so kindly, and with some reference to yourself, for I am not blind to your good qualities and natural parts—farther expostulation and complaint, and was contented that you should remain in your error for awhile, satisfied that it would not be very long before you would be disabused of it. That time is now at hand; a few miles farther will bring us to the forks, and you will then find that I will certainly take the upper road for Beattie's Bluff, while you, if your aim be Benton, will as certainly take that which crosses the river below. It only remains that I should again assure you, with all the solemnity of an oath, though I make none, that I am by profession a lawyer, that I have never dreamed of any other, and do not know, and have never thought to inquire, whether I have the most partial qualification for the stage. I admire good acting, am not deficient in a knowledge of the best dramatists, can quote Shakspeare almost as frequently, if not so felicitously as yourself, and, at another time than this,—with less care upon my mind, and less business upon my hands,—I should be particularly pleased to hear you in any, and all, of your favourite parts. Believe me, Mr. Horsey, from what I have already seen, I am prepared to believe that it is in your power, with study, industry, and humility, to rise to considerable distinction in your art.” “Say you so, Harry? Then I forgive you all the rest. I forgive you all that d—d dignity that makes me feel all over as if Carter himself had caught me playing tricks with my neighbours' sign boards, and was scoring me hip and thigh with a most thorny morality. But, Harry, do you really think from what you have seen that I should become a proper actor?” “I do, really, Mr. Horsey.” “That is to say with study and industry. But what do you mean by humility? I don't see any necessity for humility. Indeed, that's the last matter that a modern actor esteems as a requisite.” “The most necessary of all, for without humility one learns nothing. He will neither see in what he is himself defective, nor in what consists his rival's superiority. He can learn nothing who believes there is little left him to learn, and he alone learns all that man can teach, who is humble enough to doubt his own possessions, and hopeful enough to labour for their increase. I should have high hopes of you, Mr. Horsey, could you bring yourself to this conviction.” “God bless you, my dear fellow, these are devilish kind words of yours. Devilish kind! I'm d—nably unused to them. I've heard nothing all my life but censure; sneer and censure. Managers, and actors, and audience,—no, d—me, I won't say any thing about the audience, they have always treated me well enough whenever I had fair play before them,—but, by my soul, I can't say the same for my brother actors, and still less favourably can I speak of managers. Had I believed them, I should have cut my throat, or turned in as a wagoner, or taken to some other villanous handicraft which only suffers a man to know that he is alive at meal-time. They have denied all my hopes and decried all my talents; and then came doubts to my mind;—doubts—dark, dirty, earth-whelming, miserable doubts, Mr. Vernon, that made my soul sick, and made me feel as if I could steal away into some dark corner of the woods and die; satisfied, if out of human sight, that they spoke nothing but the truth—that I had deceived myself— that, in short, I had none of that genius, the fires of which I fancied to be blazing away proudly and in-extinguishably in soul and brain. Oh, Harry Vernon, these were killing, crushing doubts, and when they came to me, as they always did when I was out of money, and the d—d tailors and tavern-keepers at my heels, I felt all over as the meanest of all possible beings. But you cheer me; your words—for I believe you, Harry, to be a d—d smart fellow—your words reassure me. I feel my courage rise; I feel the fire blazing up within me, and by all that's resolute in man, it shall blaze out, ere many days, to the satisfaction of others. But, though you give me life, Harry, curse me but you crush me again when you tell me you are not one of us. I can hardly believe you even now. I heard it so solemnly asserted, and, indeed, lost and paid a bet on the matter.” “Something strange, at least, in all this business,” said Vernon, curiously. “Pray where did you hear this story?” “In Raymond, while you were talking in the court-house.” “My talking in the court-house, alone, should have sufficed to prove my profession.” “Yes, it would, and it did, at first; but there was a d—d plausible story told me about the matter, which made me throw it all up as so much gammon.” “And who took so much interest in me, and so much pains to lead you astray in this matter, Mr. Horsey? Can you remember?” The actor, without hesitation, gave full details of the conference with Hawkins and Saxon in the village of Raymond, narrated such portions of the dialogue as had special reference to theatricals and his companion's probable connexion with them, and from the succinctness of his statements, and the clearness with which he repeated the several parts taken by the two, he soon convinced Vernon that there must have been a sinister purpose in the minds of the men who made such seemingly gratuitous mis-statements. The name of Hawkins strengthened this conviction. “Hawkins, Hawkins! That was the name of the man whom the governor arrested.” “The same,” replied Horsey. “He's a strange sort of suspicious chap. Every body thinks there's something wrong about him, but they can't tell what. He gambles, they all know; but he's so cunning they can find nothing worse against him; though I've no doubt they're right in thinking him a great rascal.” “Indeed! and can it be that you value your character so little as to consort with a fellow whom you think a rascal?” “Ah, Harry, there you have me. But, truth to speak, a poor devil like myself, whom one set snarls at, and the other laughs at, is devilish well satisfied to get a companion who will do neither, without being particularly anxious to know whether he's as good a man as he should be, or even as he appears. Besides, let me tell you, Hawkins is a smart fellow. He has Shakspeare at his fingers' ends, and I've seen him throw that into his face, while he's been going through a part of Iago, which would send a shiver through pit and gallery at a glance.” “Enough: these men have lied to you, Mr. Horsey, at least so far as I have been concerned. They have, I gather from your account of it, used you as a spy upon me.” “The devil you say?” “Think over the matter yourself, my friend, and you cannot escape this conviction. They have flattered your ruling passion, and have gleaned from you all the knowledge of me and my movements which might have been in your possession. Fortunately, you knew nothing, and could reveal nothing, —nothing at least of very serious importance. Whether any thing worse will grow out of it than this wild-goose chase upon which they have sent you, it is impossible now to say. It will be important, however, that we should both be cautious in our future progress.” “Spoken like a book, Harry. But why the d—l should these fellows want to know your movements, —heh? So you have secrets, Harry—there is a mystery—there—” “Professional and personal, purely, Mr. Horsey, and when I tell you this much, I trust, I secure myself against further inquiry. To convince you, however, that I regard you with interest and favour, I make free to counsel you to return to your friends and family. I do not believe this story of theatrical establishments at Benton and other places. The country is unfit for, and unable to support them. A circus, now, would be more reasonable; a place for ground and lofty tumbling; but, seriously, I look upon the dramatic art as utterly foreign to such regions as the Yazoo. There is, as yet, no settled population. The country is uncleared, and thoroughly wild; settled by squatters, chiefly—without means, tastes, education, or sensibility; rude, rough people; a people peculiarly fitted for the conquest of savages and savage lands, but utterly incapable of appreciating an art so exquisite and intellectual as that of the legitimate drama. Go back, and if it be your resolute determination to seek for fame in the prosecution of your present purpose—which I would not counsel—seek it, then, where only it is to be found. Go to the large cities—go to the largest. Where the ability exists to pay best, there will always the best talent assemble—there will the true standards of critical judgment be formed, and rival powers will soon reduce each other to their just level, until which there can be no certain reputation. There is something very puny in the judgment of small communities; and something very contemptible in being a little lion in a little plain. Go to the ring where all the challengers assemble, and strike the shield of the most insolent and bold. When you have done this, you will find your level, and what is of more importance to you still, you will have justly arrived at a knowledge of your own strength. Till then, you walk in vapour, and the stars which shine above you are far or near, according to the wind and the weather, your own caprice of mood, or the caprice of feeling and judgment of those with whom you mingle. Understand me, Mr. Horsey, I do not counsel you by what I have said, to pursue the stage. Far from it. I believe the glories of the profession to be very uncertain, and its golden rewards, half the time, to be visionary; besides, it is attended by a thousand defeats and humiliations which are gall and wormwood to the independent spirit. On this head, you know best what you will do, and to your calm, common-sense reflection, I am willing to leave it. But if you are resolved to be an actor, then it is my advice that you break ground where the audience is large, and where the competitors are many; where you will be compelled to take pains to preserve rank and respectability, and where no petty management or petty clique can prevent your efforts, or do injustice to your performance. Go to the great city, if you must act, and throw yourself upon the waters. Remember VOL. I. 18 the noble chorus in your own favourite play, `A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, And monarchs to behold the swelling scene, Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars—' It is only, you perceive, where the field is large,— commensurate to the greatness of the actor—that he can be like himself,—that he can do justice to himself, or feel that ambitious spurring of the soul which is conscious always of her true occasions.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.” King Henry V. We arrest the farther dialogue which took place between the two before their separation. Horsey was gratified at the interest which Vernon seemed to take in his fortunes, for the simple but dignified manners of the young lawyer had impressed him with a respectful deference, which had the effect, not unfrequently, of restraining his exuberance of character, and compelling him to meditate awhile before speaking; a practice exceedingly novel to him, and one which kept him from sundry outbreaks of folly while they were in company together. He listened with unaccustomed patience to the exhortations of Vernon, and though he had not the courage to forbear the small game which he was even then pecking at, he acknowledged the generally beneficial tenor of the advice given him. He was not willing to believe that the forest world in which he was about to penetrate was unsusceptible of present dramatic improvement, and still less was he willing to tolerate the suspicion which his companion threw out, that the story of Tilton's theatrical establishment at Benton was a falsehood—a hoax invented for the simple purpose of securing him as an instrument in the prosecution of some ulterior purpose as yet unaccountable to either party. His heart was set upon obtaining the plaudits of the Bentonians, and his ears already rang prospectively with their clapping and huzzas. These, he thought, would not be amiss, even though at some future period, he struck at the higher game of the great metropolis. Small triumphs are the forerunners of great ones; and he was one of those who thought it just as well to accept the wreath of myrtle, if the more enduring laurel could not be so easily procured. With this philosophy he was the more readily reconciled to a separation from the companion, in conjunction with whom, until the present hour, he fancied he was to enter the green and verdurous fields of an actor's immortality. He had many regretful quotations to utter; many protestations of fidelity and friendship. “And should you want help, Harry,” he cried out as they rode asunder, “should you get into any spree and want a backer to see you safe, give me a sign, a signal—let me have the cue—and by the ghost of Garrick, I will need no prompter to tell me what my part should be in the business. I will be at your side in the twinkling of an eye, and they shall be Turks and Trojans of heavy metal, indeed—Syracusans of stamp and substance—who will hold their ground long before us twain,—my Pythias and myself.” Long and heartily did the adhesive actor wring the hand of his companion, to whom, though not an ascetic, the scenic exuberance of his friend became almost an annoyance; and he found it a relief to escape from that excruciating degree of affection to which he felt unable to make more than a very partial return. His escape was at length effected, though Horsey, like Prior's thief, “Now fitted the halter, now traversed the cart, And often took leave, but seemed loth to depart.” It will somewhat confirm the truth of the assurances of sorrow which he expressed at parting with his friend, to say, that, for full twenty minutes after leaving him, he uttered no single quotation, unless we may except the fragment of a speech made to his horse, the renewal of whose irregular motion had revived all the peculiar sensibility of old sores made the day previous. “Ah, Bowline, Bowline! Shakspeare almost gave me warning against thee in particular; certainly I have the `rubbers,' though I did not expect them. If you go on at this rate, you limping d—l, Romeo's quarters will be in no condition to climb balconies, or do the necessary action of a lover. I am parched and peeled, hip and thigh, literally scalded, as tender as a steamed potato, and as raw as a thoroughly done one. Well, well, it is to be expected. One should not complain where the end promises so much. These, I suppose, are the first pains which a man is expected to take in getting on in the world—the pains of immortality, the condition of greatness, a suffering in the flesh for the ambitious workings of the spirit, which should teach a man, among other lessons, to value the glory, when won, which he purchases at so much cost. Well, it is but a skin-deep suffering, after all, and there is some consolation in knowing, you limping rascal, that I can make you share it. My spurring shall equal your scalding, or there never yet went two words to a bargain.” While the actor communed after this manner with his uneasy steed, Harry Vernon, better mounted, was making his forward way with a speed rather greater than his wont, as it was his object to make up for the time lost in waiting upon Horsey's operations at the hut of Yarbers, and, subsequently, in that which had been consumed in their parting. He had ridden probably an hour after that event, and the motion of his horse had been suffered to relax into 18* that ordinary walking trot to which most horses on long travel naturally incline. The thoughts of the rider, busied with other subjects, were now abstracted from the movements of his steed, and he was gradually becoming indifferent to, and unobservant of, surrounding objects, when he was brought to his senses by the sudden and fast trampling of a horse's feet behind him. Looking round, what was his surprise to behold Edward Mabry, the lover of Mary Stinson, in the person of his pursuer. Vernon drew up and awaited him—readily guessing the purpose of his pursuit, and really glad that Horsey had taken another course, and got so greatly the start of one whose desperate hostility was apparent in every glance of his eye, and in every motion of his malignant, and now wretched countenance. The tokens of the combat of the preceding night were prominently offensive. His eyes were so swollen that the orbs were barely perceptible, and the sight must have been barely sufficient to enable him to ride. This condition of his face made the rage which appeared its leading expression, look monstrous and fiendish. His lips were tremulous though closed, the veins upon his forehead tensely corded; and the skin around, affected by the injuries done to his eyes, had assumed in spots, a dark, dirty green colour, which added to the general hideousness of his present aspect. He was armed with a rifle, which, perhaps, in the present situation of his eyes, would be found far less formidable than usual. Glaring upon Vernon with an expression of hostility which almost left it doubtful in our hero's mind if he himself were not also the object of his pursuit, he demanded to know what had become of his companion. His words were few and passionate, and the disrespectful manner in which he spoke, and the brutal epithets which he applied at the same time to the person for whom he inquired, had the effect of producing a certain degree of irritation in the mind of Vernon, which kept his answer in suspense. The youth repeated his demand in a style of insolence more offensive than before. “I have no desire to quarrel with you,” said Vernon, “but still less am I disposed to satisfy the demands of any one who makes them disrespectfully. I will not answer your question. I will tell you nothing about Mr. Horsey or his movements.” “Ha! then you take his place. You shall answer for him yourself,” cried the other, dropping his reins and grasping his rifle in both hands. The instinctive and natural movement of Vernon was to close with him at once, and thus defeat the contemplated employment of the deadly weapon with which he threatened him. He wheeled his horse instantly beside that of the assailant, and his left hand grasped the weapon also. “What mean you, madman? What would you do?” demanded Vernon, sternly. “But that I pity you, your movement this instant would have prompted me to shoot you down like a dog. If you are angry with Mr. Horsey, that is no business of mine. I am not answerable for his conduct nor his absence.” “Then tell me where he is,” replied the other hoarsely, “or stand in his shoes.” “Neither, sir. I will give you no assistance in your folly.” A scuffle followed this reply. Mabry strove to back his horse in order that he might employ his rifle. Such at least seemed his object to Vernon, whose efforts were directed to defeat this purpose; and suffering the other to recede, he addressed all his strength to obtaining possession of the weapon, which Mabry, in the sudden backward movement of his horse, was compelled to yield up, or suffer himself to be drawn with it between the two animals. Furious at this disadvantage he leaped to the ground and drawing a bowie knife, rushed forward. But a few paces divided them, and the rapidity of his assailant's movement was such that Vernon felt he could neither take aim, nor prepare the weapon in time to anticipate his attack. With this conviction he put spurs to his horse and drew him up only after he had put a space of fifty yards between them. “Advance upon me a second time, young man, and I shoot you without scruple. You are a madman to act in this manner. What have I done to you? Of what do you complain? Do you think I will answer your questions, or the questions of any body who does not speak respectfully? Do you suppose I will assist in guiding you to the commission of murder? You are mistaken in me no less than in yourself. In a fair struggle, were I so disposed, I should put you down as effectually as you were put down last night; and were it not that I should derive but little satisfaction from such a victory, your insolent language might have provoked me to have done so before this. Think a little before you move farther in this business. By this time the person you seek is far beyond your reach; and as for me, you gain nothing, I assure you, by annoying me. I will return you your rifle if you will promise me that you will not use it.” “I will make no promise,” replied the other, leaping again upon his steed, “we shall soon be at closer quarters.” And with these words, with a fury even more blind than his hurt vision, the madman was preparing to urge his horse forward upon the speaker, heedless of warning, and in utter defiance of the lifted rifle. “I warn you again,—once, twice, thrice, I warn you,” were the slow, deliberate tones of Vernon's voice, as, dropping the rifle in his left hand, he lifted the ranging sights before his eye, “approach me, Mr. Mabry, with bared weapon, and I will certainly shoot you.” “I defy, I dare you. Shoot, and be d—d! I fear you not,” said the fellow, as he put spurs to his horse. “Hold!” cried the voice of one who darted before his path, emerging into the main road from a little Indian trail that crossed it at nearly equal distances between the contending parties. The interruption was seasonable enough. Vernon had already cocked the rifle, and the approach, by ten steps more, of his furious assailant, would have had the effect of drawing his fire. The entrance of the third personage relieved him from a dreadful necessity. “Hold, you, Ned Mabry, you meal-headed fellow! What the deuce is it you're a-doing?” The abrupt salutation arrested the rash onset of the youth, and probably saved his life. The stranger was a tall backwoodsman, fully six feet in height, and solid and massive like a tower. He rode a coal-black horse of proportions and strength of corresponding greatness with his own—a keen, fire-eyed animal, broad chested, strongly quartered, slim in fetlock, small in hoof, long necked, narrow headed, and with a mane, which, though plaited and divided on either side, seemed scarcely less copious than that of the full possession of the ordinary horse. His own person was no less symmetrical and erect than it was large and powerful. His cheeks were of a fine sanguine hue, his eyes bright, blue and lively, denoting good nature, with an arch, lurking humour, that perhaps indicated a fondness for his jest in defiance of the broken bones which are sometimes apt to follow it. His nose was finely Roman, and his forehead, though neither broad nor high, was yet full, suitably large, and contributed to that general expression of character, rather than talents, which belonged to his other features. He looked earnestly for a few minutes upon Vernon while addressing Mabry, to whom he spoke in the familiar language of an old acquaintance. “Well, now you're a pretty lark to serve me in this way, Ned Mabry. Didn't you promise me you wouldn't do any thing more with this business. Didn't you say you'd let the stranger get off, and say no more about it; and here, only two hours after, I find you, like a cursed maw-mouth that grows blind when he sees a worm wriggle, here you're mad after the bait though there's a hook in it. Don't you see the rifle—you a'n't bullet-proof, I reckon?” “It's my own rifle, Walter,” said the assailant, sullenly. “The devil it is!” cried the other with a laugh; “then it's a sign I haven't come a minute too soon. You've got another warning of the truth I told you. Look you, stranger,” turning to Vernon, to whom the sudden arrival of a third person, who seemed an associate of his enemy, only cautioned to greater watchfulness; “look you, stranger, you mustn't take it hard that this mad fellow set upon you, seeing you've took his sweetheart from him, and put his two eyes in double-mourning. It's mighty hard to lose one's gal and get a beating all in the same night, and I reckon there's a mighty few of us that wouldn't be just as mad as Ned Mabry after it.” “But I've done neither,” said Vernon; “I've neither beaten him, nor took his sweetheart from him. I have done him no sort of injury, intentional or otherwise; and he has no more excuse to assail me than he has to assail the man in the moon.” “How! how the d—l's this, Ned? Didn't you tell me?” “Not this one,—the other—the man that was travelling with him.” “The splinters! and so you set upon the wrong man. Well, I say, that's being owl-blind, stone-blind, horse-blind; blind of three eyes, without even a smeller to go by. What the devil made you trouble him?” This question was soon answered, and the cause of difference explained. The good-natured stranger proceeded to patch up the affair, and, if possible, reconcile the parties. On Vernon's side this was no great difficulty. The other, foiled on every hand, baffled so far in the pursuit of one who had humbled him so successfully, and suffering from his bruises of body no less than those of mind, was just in that state of stupid doggedness when conciliation was almost as much thrown away upon him as argument and explanation. More was done by the sheer influence of the stranger's wish, than by his reasoning. The rustic lover seemed to recognize in Wat or Walter Rawlins,—for such was the name of the last comer, —a superior, before whom he stood irresolute and dependent. He confirmed the promise made in his behalf by the latter to Vernon, that he would offer him no farther injury or insult, and, at his solicitation, he returned the rifle to Mabry, though not until he had pushed the flint from the teeth of the cock, thus depriving him of the power of doing any immediate harm with the instrument, unless he went better provided than usual. He had performed this movement with so little effort and so much adroitness, while the lock of the gun lay beneath his right hand, and on the opposite side of his horse to that where the other parties stood, that he had escaped observation; and, satisfied with the possession of his weapon, Mabry gave no glance to the condition in which it was returned to him. “And now, Ned Mabry, go you home and be quiet,” said his companion. “You promised me before to do nothing in this business, and it's a dead weight on your credit now that you didn't keep your word. You a'n't in any condition now to look up your enemies. With them eyes you could not see to hit a squirrel, though he sat on a bare stump grinning at you with all his grinders; and how should you look, going after a fellow who's got his own peepers wide awake. Go back, I say, and keep quiet till you see me again. As for this business of Yarbers himself,” continued the pacificator, drawing his companion away to some little distance from the place where Vernon stood, and lowering his voice to a whisper—“say nothing till you see me. There's something strange about it, and we've got some mighty strange neighbours. Don't whisper it to saint or sinner till we can tell whether it's a safe person that's to hear it, and this there's no telling jist at this time, when the whole country is in a sort of topsy-turvy, and strange men come about us hearing what they can, and telling nothing in return. There's nothing to do but to keep quiet as I tell you, and out of harm's way. I won't be gone longer than a week; in the meantime get your eyes open if you can, and keep 'em so. I'll keep on awhile with this stranger, and see what I can drive out of him. He don't look and behave like a man who was one of Yarbers' kidney, and I've a sort o' notion you're quite wrong in your guess that they're in one and the same business. I'll worm it out of him in no time, I reckon. If he's got the cunning of a rogue, I've got cunning enough to see how deep it goes; and if he a'n't a rogue, why then there will be one more honest man found to help the rest.” Much more was said ere they separated, though the conference occupied but little time. Vernon meanwhile bade them a courteous “good-day,” and was about to set forward, when the voice of Rawlins arrested him. “Stay a bit, stranger, if so be you like company. I'm driving on in the same track with you for a few miles farther, at least, and if you're like myself, you'll agree that it's no bad thing to have somebody at your elbow, if it's only to answer questions. When a man's by himself he's apt to think strange things; and the devil's more apt to be on the look-out for a single traveller than when they go in pairs to strengthen each other. I am a ra'al joker when the humour suits, and I can sing, too, when the weather a'n't against it, and the frogs don't rise in the throat. So you see—” “Say no more,” said Vernon; “it will please me to have your company.” “Spoken like a man, and I'll be with you after a word more with this unbroke colt. Now, Ned Mabry, you promise me to give over the chase of this fellow.” Such was the promise which Rawlins exacted from his companion ere they separated—a promise reluctantly given, and badly kept; since he had scarce reached the crossroads in returning, ere his rage resumed full sway over him, and he struck into the path which Horsey had taken, giving full rein to his horse, in the hope to make up for that loss of time in the pursuit which had been occasioned by the events of the previous hour. Vernon was joined by Rawlins, and in a few moments, on the place which they had just occupied, stood the outlaw Saxon, who emerged from the woods on one hand, and was immediately after joined by a comrade named Jones, who came to the spot from an opposite quarter. “I would give something to know what Mabry VOL. I. 19 and Rawlins had to talk about so long in secret;” said Saxon. “Could you make out nothing?” “Not a syllable,” said Jones. “His coming was untimely.” “Yes: but for that we should have lost one who may become an enemy. Yarbers, certainly, would have been the gainer; and we should have had good reason for tying the arms of this fellow Vernon behind him. This, however, we must do before long.” “We must use Judge Nawls for that business, I reckon.” “Ay, none better,” said Saxon; “but do you go ahead, and keep on the haunches of these fellows. Rawlins, I suppose, is on his way to the old Methodist quarter. He and Vernon know each other for the first time, and they will probably separate at Brother Badger's turn-out. Do not lose him from sight. I will join you before midnight.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. “The noyse thereof cald forth that straunger knight, To weet what dreadfull thing was there in hond; Where whenas two brave knights in bloody fight, With deadly rancor he enraunged fond, His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond, And shining blade unsheathed.” Spenser. Vernon rode on with his new companion, Rawlins—whom he soon discovered to be quite a social, good-humoured fellow—with a speed which was intended to make up for lost time. It was his desire to reach and cross the ferry over the Chitta-Loosa before sunset, in order that he might find lodgings on the opposite side at a conveniently early hour. But this purpose, when expressed, was discouraged by his companion. “It will be quite dark before you can get across the ferry,—which is more a ferry and a half than a ferry; mighty bad crossing and a strange up and down, in and out, turning and twisting contrivance as ever you did see,—and then, when you're across, it's a chance if you find any place to stay at, that can be called a place at all, under seven or eight miles. But if you'll go with me to old Billy Badger's to-night—he's only two miles from the ferry—you can take an early start in the morning, and have a whole day before you. Billy Badger's a crumpy, stiff sort of a person—a raal, true-believing Methodist, that preaches himself when the parson don't come, and to my way of thinking, makes a deuced sight the best prayer of any among them. He's rather strange in his ways, to be sure, but you'll be heartily welcome. He'll give you a good supper, but you must swallow the long grace that goes before it; and if one happens to be mighty hungry, it's a great trying of the patience. I've been a-bothered by it more than once before, but it's no use. Nothing can stop him when he once begins, and I do think if the house was a fire, he'd sooner let it burn awhile than cut the prayer off in the middle. Now, I'm used to it myself and don't mind it so much, but I think it only right, when I ax a man to another's house, that I should tell him what he's to look for.” “A good rule,” said Vernon; “and without saying whether I will go with you or not, let me know whether Mr. Badger is in the habit of receiving company.” “Sure he is; he has 'em at all times and of all characters. Why, his house is something of a thoroughfare, you see; being so near the ferry, and folks a-travelling jist like you, and coming up late in the day, are mighty apt to go to old Billy's to spend the night.” “But that must give him a great deal of trouble, if he keeps no public house.” “Not a bit, or if it does, he don't mind it in consideration of the good company, and somebody to talk to. Though he's a gruff and grumpy sort of person, he's mighty fond of a confabulation, and so long as you'll listen, and even if you wont listen, he'll still talk on, exhorting, as it were, and mighty airnest. When he once gits hold of the flesh and the devil, there's no telling how long he'll hold on. It's no trifle that'll make him let go; and you'll see the blood git up into his face, and the veins grow big on his forehead, and the foam will come out and stand in his mouth-corners long before he'll think you've had enough. He never asks how you like the thing, for he always concludes that he knows best what's good for every body; and as for disagreeing with him, when once you set eyes on him, you'll see for yourself that that's out of the question. I tell you, sir, Mr. Vernon, he looks like all the Laws and the Prophets; and he speaks as if he stood on a high place, and we were all put below to listen to him.” “A stern old man—a very judge in Israel—from your description.” “The very thing, Mr. Vernon; but then he's really kind as any man alive, though, for that matter, he haint the knack of showing it kindly. He'll help you up from the road with the look of the same fellow that knocked you down; and bind up your wounds with as sour a face all the while, as if his own bowie-knife had made them. He'll talk to you as if he thought you a rogue, just at the very time when he's lending you a cool hundred; and when he's helping you to the best on his table, he'll be grumbling something about the indulgences of the flesh, and the profligacies of appetite, and all that sort of thing; so, unless you set out to find a bundle of contradictions in every thing he does and says, there's no telling how to take him.” “I've met with such a character before,” said Vernon; “it is neither unusual nor unnatural, and only indicates a predominating self-esteem, that asserts its superiority by eccentricities of thought and manner. The eccentricities of men arise, mostly, from an undue estimate of their own importance, which flatters itself by the surprises it continually effects, by means of novelty and strangeness, 19* in the minds of the observers. So long as these eccentricities hurt nobody, people are content to laugh or wonder at them; when they exceed this limit, the owner ceases to be a fool, and is locked up as a madman. Has this old gentleman a family.” “He has a son who is nothing like him—a sly, cautious fellow, that I don't know whether to like or dislike—he's neither one thing nor t'other, and, to speak a truth, one reason against my liking him may be that he don't seem to like me.” “A good and sufficient reason. There are some love-verses which maintain this philosophy in strong and proper language:— `What care I how fair she be, If she be not fair for me.' Has the old gentleman no other family?” “Yes,” replied the other with a hesitating tone. “He's got a niece—a mighty fine girl, named Rachel, out of the Scriptures; the young man his son is named out of the Scriptures, too,—they call him Gideon,—though, I'm thinking that his name is all that he ever got out of the Holy Book, or ever will get. There's something wrong about him, I reckon.” “But Rachel, there's nothing wrong about her— you don't dislike Rachel, do you, Mr. Rawlins? for, if you do, I shall begin to wonder why it is you visit the family.” “Ah, Mr. Vernon, you're a keen one. You must be a lawyer, I'm thinking. But you say right, there's nothing wrong about Rachel, and if the truth is to be told, I may as well tell it at once—I do like Rachel. I think—though I don't count her so pretty as some that I've seen and could mention—I think she is about the finest and best. She's so sweet-tempered, and so modest and good; and then, she has a great deal more sense, and a power of larning, more than ever I expect to cram into this bigger noddle of mine. I confess to you, Mr. Vernon, I do like Rachel.” The frankness of the rustic lover, had already placed the parties on the most friendly footing. His confession increased the respect which the lawyer had begun to entertain for him. He replied playfully— “And reasoning, Mr. Rawlins, from what you have said of Gideon, I presume, one of your best arguments for liking Rachel is found in her liking you. Is it not so?—you love each other.” There is, perhaps, nothing so likely to win the heart of a young lover, as to seek his confidence on the subject nearest to his affections. The interest we betray in his passion saves him from the fear of ridicule—an always prevalent fear with the tribe of passionates,—and that sinking fulness of heart which distinguishes the lover, must find some friendly bosom into which to pour its hopes, its fears, its tumultuous and joyous expectancies. The words of Vernon unsealed the fountain, and took the stone from its lips. After that, Rawlins had no farther concealments. He grasped the hand of his companion, and, warning him the while to secrecy,—a caution which was rather insisted upon by the respect which he had for the maiden, than because of any desire on his own part to maintain, as a secret, a fact which was so full to him of triumph as well as joy—he told him that he had been successful in persuading Rachel to regard him as the properest man in the country. His courtship, from the beginning, underwent developement in all its details, with a more circumstantial distinctness than even that of Othello, though it did not appear that the affections of Rachel were secured for her lover through a like medium. The judgment of Rawlins deferred to that of the maiden of his heart. He studiously insisted upon her mental superiority, and spoke in the becoming language of that humility which acknowledges the favour of fortune in his conquests, and assumes no share of the merit to himself. “I will go with you to-night, Mr. Rawlins, and see this lady.” “Do, that's a friend, Mr. Vernon; it does me good when a man of sense and education talks with Rachel. She's mighty sweet-spoken and smart; has a whole closet-full of books; and sends to Natchy for more whenever she can get a chance. Now, other men would much rather have a wife to work and mend for them, and would count it mighty idle to see 'em poking over books; but I'm not that sort of man. I'd want my wife to talk respectably, jist the same as if she lived in a big city like Orleans; for if a man's poor as Job's turkey to-day, it's no reason he should be poor to-morrow. In this country, a man may git rich in double quick time, if he's only constant and sober to his business; and if the Lord spares me, Mr. Vernon, I'm bent on making my children men of substance and education. If I had no learning myself—and, like most of our people, seven months time would cover every hour of schooling I ever had,—I know the good of learning, and my children will have enough to do them good, whether I live or die, if so be their mother's able to give it them; and I'd sooner have my wife teaching her children to read and write, than darning stockings, or mending breeches, or doing any of that sort of business, which a nigger girl can do that never had any education at all.” It amused Vernon to hear his companion counting his chickens with so much complacency, and making his arrangements how to train them, even before they were hatched. He smiled with an expression of that humour upon his countenance which formed no small portion of his character. “Of course, Mr. Rawlins, you have consulted with Rachel on this subject; you have told her your plans at length.” “To be sure I have. Do you think I'd keep such a matter from her? No, no, sir, as God's my judge there ain't any thing in my bosom that I've kept from her ears, since that moment when she said `yes' to my asking. It was only last week—I go to see her about once a week, Mr. Vernon—it was only last week I tried to get her to say, if she had a son, which she would like best to have him, a lawyer or a doctor; and it was a great worry to me to get her to talk about the matter at all, and what she did say was as much as to say, `have your own way about it,' for it came to as little. Now, Mr. Vernon, I know that there's nothing so troublesome in families as a difference between man and wife about these things, and I wanted to put the matter out of all danger of dispute. It was strange to me that Rachel, who can talk so well about most matters, and give me so much good advice when I want it, shouldn't be willing to tell me her real notions.” “Perhaps she thought there was time enough a year or two hence for the consideration of the subject. You, on the other hand, I perceive, are for taking time by the forelock. You prefer being quick to being slow. She, too, might have been thinking of girl children, only; who, of course, can neither be doctors nor lawyers.” “Well, that's true, there may be something in that, Mr. Vernon, but then, again, you know it's an equal chance that we should have boys as well as girls. I was going to tell her that, but she broke off suddenly, because she thought she heard the old man calling her from the house.” The unsophisticated lover impressed Vernon favourably as regarded both himself and mistress, by the naturalness with which he detailed his own secret thoughts and desires, and the manners of the damsel. That Rachel was more thoughtful than her lover, and quite as good a tactician, he had no sort of doubt from the chapter of developements which had been made by the former. How long Rawlins would have gone on in a narrative which was too pleasing to his heart and fancies to suffer the obtrusion of other thoughts and objects on his mind, it would be difficult to say. He was checked by an abrupt inquiry of Vernon, and brought back to the more earthly objects of humanity, with some slowness and a little reluctance. “Hear you those dogs? there are several beagles —do you hunt much in this neighbourhood, Mr. Rawlins?” “Beagles! I don't hear any, Mr. Vernon.” “I have heard them for the last twenty minutes, but the truth is, Mr. Rawlins, when a man's in love he hears nothing and sees little that does not concern his mistress. This is your condition. For the last half hour we have talked of nothing else, and you have heard nothing that did not call for an answer about her. Now I have heard the baying of these beagles beside and before us, as if scattered, and crossing on false scents. Who keeps a pack about here?” “A pack of beagles! I don't think there's such a thing in the county, Mr. Vernon. There's one or two here and there in different places—there's some two or three I know of, but no more. John Herne —he's something of a hunter, and has several dogs, but only one hound, and that's but a poor affair, Macartney, the Scotchman, that lives on the edge of Atala, he has one, but he don't hunt. Ned Mabry, the chap that would have mauled you this morning, if you had let him, he has two, and both of them fine pups, but he's not the man to think of deer hunting to-day. Besides him, I can't call to mind another man in our neighbourhood that keeps a beagle.” “That is strange, for I have certainly heard several at different points of the compass within this hour. Hark! hear you not now?” “Yes, that's a beagle, but it sounds mighty faint, and may be, after all, from a tongue that you never hear close, and the dog that owns it ain't so easy to be seen. You know there's a story in these parts of a ghost-dog that haunts the woods about the Big Black; they call him the white dog of Chitta-Loosa, and old folks tell strange things about him, how he let his master be murdered, and now has nothing to do but to run through the woods constantly looking after him. He is said to keep in the swamp of the Big Black, and you hear him always just as evening is coming on, as if he was calling to his master, and was making moan that another night was near at hand, and he hadn't yet found him. There's a-many sounds in these woods, and sights too, I've heard them tell of, that you'll hear without knowing where they come from, or who they belong to. People about here don't mind them much now, since they've got a little used to them; but when I first came on the Big Black, it made my heart beat mighty quick, I tell you, and made me clap long spurs to my horse, to hear them; and even now, I catch myself saying my prayers, without knowing when I begin, to find myself belated on the edge of the swamp, nobody with me, and on a sudden hear a whisper close at my elbow, and may be a laugh and a clapping of the hands behind me.” “But why should you think this any thing more than ordinary. This whispering, and laughing, and clapping,—nay, this baying of dogs,—may all be the work of men.” “No men, no men, Mr. Vernon!—I'm a man myself, and can answer that. I'm a stout man, sound in wind and limb, six feet in stocking foot, and able to swing a cotton bag, and that's a-much for any body to do. Besides, I'm not afraid of any fellow that ever I saw yet, that had no better help than flesh and blood, broad shoulders, and solid muscle, can give him; and when I've turned and challenged them that made these noises, and put into the swamps after them—and I've a keen nose, and a quick eye among the bushes, Mr. Vernon—and after all could find nothing to lay a finger on, why then it was time to think of saying one's prayers, and using one's spurs. Now, don't you go to think from what I'm saying that I'm easily frightened with ghosts and images. I'm frightened at nothing I can see and feel; but when a body can neither see nor feel—when eyes and hands fail, what's to be done? Am I to stand then, waiting what's to come? No, no, I'm clear for clean heels without waiting for orders. I asked Rachel if it was right for me to run in such cases, and she clearly agreed it was. Well, when our counts come to the same ending, there's nothing more to be said about it, and run's the word for me. A ghost that I can see, or a man that I can feel, will never make me stir my ankles faster than I choose; but I don't think it's any shame to use one's trotters when he can make no use of his other limbs.” “Give your horse a light spur now, Mr. Rawlins,” said Vernon, gravely, “and let us ride on a little faster. These beagles seem to increase in number, and I can distinguish the baying of no less than three from several quarters. If there be so few in the county as you assert, then are these noises the more mysterious, and they must have some object. Now, as I am one of those who will not easily believe in your white dog of the Chitta-Loosa, or in the ghost of a dog at all, I am persuaded that what we hear are the voices of real flesh and blood beings, whether of hounds or men. If they are voices of men, they imitate well, and must have some leading object for acquiring the practice; if they are those of beagles, then may we get a glimpse of a close chase, and, perhaps, join in a pursuit, which I am very fond of. A pistol bullet may bring down a deer at a small distance, and I have known a man get a shot near enough to enable him to do business with a pistol. I will have mine in readiness.” “I will not fail you, Mr. Vernon,” said the other, in suppressed accents, and bringing his horse more closely to the side of his companion. “It's jist as well to have your pistols ready, if we are to seek for these hounds you speak of, for, to tell you a truth, it has been for a long time my notion that there were men at the bottom of some of these noises of dogs; not that there are not other noises of the woods that could never have been made by any man—that I'll swear for—and if you know'd half as much of our country and the swamps as I do, you'd be for thinking like myself. I could tell you of the strangest things—” “Not now! not now!” exclaimed Vernon, impatiently, “but get your pistols out, my good fellow; it may be a word and a blow with us. I hear one sound responding to another, and the last did not seem more than a couple of hundred yards distant, in that thick branch. Let us ride apart, a rifle's sight could cover us both.” Speaking thus, Vernon spurred his horse forward VOL. I. 20 in a smart canter, while Rawlins, obeying his suggestion, prepared his weapons, and followed him at a horse's length behind. They had scarcely increased their motion, when a sudden clamour reached their ears in front; a hoarse summons, the voice of a man in anger, mingled with lower tones, as if in expostulation. These were followed by a shriek—a repeated shriek, and the accents of a woman—of woman in distress! This put a life into the limbs, and a fire into the hearts of the two young men, which gave them no time for reflection, and left them in no doubt as to the course which they should take, and the duty which lay before them. “Lord God!” was the somewhat irreverent exclamation of Rawlins, “Lord God! Mr. Vernon, if it should be Rachel!” “It is a woman, Mr. Rawlins!—follow me close if you be a man. This is no time to loiter.” “You won't find me backward, by the powers! I'm at you, and after you. There's no scare in Wat Rawlins at the push. Lord help us! I'm afeard it's Rachel. She loves to walk in the woods so, every afternoon. Git up, you lazy b—h, or I'll knife your quarters!” The last speech, warm from the blood, and breaking out in defiance of all restraint, was addressed to his horse, which, in his anger, it will be seen that he made feminine. The animal, though fleet, and now doing his best, yet lacked the speed of Vernon's, and the distance, small at first, was increasing fast between them. The fear that another should do for the safety of his sweetheart that which he alone aimed to accomplish, was wormwood to his spirit; and his apostrophe to his steed was coupled with the driving and constant application of the spur, until the flanks of the generous animal soon grew red under the infliction. The shrieks were renewed— fast, sharp, imploring,—terminating, at length, in a long, piercing scream, which grew feeble, at last, as if from exhaustion; and when it closed, the thrilling words of Vernon, as he looked behind, and cried to Rawlins to follow, sent a creeping chill of terror to the heart of the rustic. “Push, push, or we shall be too late!” “I'm here—I'm close! This d—d beast! I hope it ain't Rachel! Get on, you b—h!—Every thing stands in the way; the trees, and bushes, and I never saw the creature so dull before. Get up, you clod-hopping b—h, or I'll kill you, by all that's certain! I've always told Rachel about walking out so far, but she wouldn't mind me, and said there was no danger; but I knew there was danger, and I said so. But these women—they won't mind any thing— they're so obstinate if they're a little smart; and so —d—n the b—h, she'll stop full short before long, and want to take a roll in the road.” There was no good reason to justify this last apprehension of the excited woodman. The animal was covering ground with a rapidity which might have done some credit to Turpin's mare. But a few seconds had passed since the first alarm, and nothing but the impatience and the special apprehensions which had seized him on a sudden in regard to the woman who was dearest to his heart, could have so utterly confounded his consciousness and judgment on all other subjects. To be passed and left behind by the young lawyer—the citizen—one of a class for whom the forest-born of our country are very apt to entertain a very wholesale contempt as respects the exercise of all those qualities which require personal strength and agility, and more especially, in the management of a horse—also added to his affliction, which, however, was not destined to endure long. Vernon had already entered upon the scene of action. The roads crossed—a large area was formed by the contact of the two paths—and here the strife was in progress, and hence the clamour. A single glance at the objects before him, gave Vernon a correct notion of the affair. A travelling carriage crossed the road, the horses being checked and held by a man whose muffled face, cap drawn over his eyes, coarse garments, rude manner, not to speak of the pistol in his grasp, at once declared him to be a ruffian and an assailant. An old man, the proprietor of the vehicle, whose white locks and bald head were uncovered and exposed, lay on the ground beneath the knee of another ruffian, while a third was busied in rifling the carriage of its contents. Two females, one a tall maiden of seventeen or thereabouts, the other a child of twelve, were on their knees to the villain who held the old man down, imploring, seemingly, for mercy; the younger of the two, clinging to the arm of the assailant, seeking with a childish pertinacity, and in utter ignorance of any danger to herself, to push him from his position. The screams which had alarmed the travellers arose from these; and they were continued by the younger of the damsels long after the elder had deemed it—the first alarm being over—an idle mode of remedying the misfortune, for the cure of which she probably meditated other means. Perhaps there were other apprehensions of womanhood more dreadful to the pure heart, which made her fearful to offend the insolence of those to whom neither herself nor parent—for such was the old man beneath the grasp of the ruffian—could oppose any powers of defence. Her efforts were those of prayer, expostulation and entreaty, until the approach of Vernon, whom she first beheld, suggested new hopes of rescue; and then her screams were joined to those of her younger sister, and gave a new impulse to the movements of our hero and his companion, who followed close upon his heels. There was but little time for reflection—none for hesitation, and the mood and character of Vernon were such as to require neither. To assail the assailants, to rescue the victims, was an instinct that sent him the nearest way to work; and coming, as he did, somewhat suddenly upon the robbers, he was able to effect that which, in a state of greater preparation on their part, it would have been fatal for him even to attempt. Their own interest in the prize, and the clamours of the young women, had kept them from hearing the tread of the approaching horsemen; and as they came into the cross-roads from the opposite track, they were totally unseen until within thirty yards of the party. It was then too late to take any of those precautions by which nothing would have been more easy than to have shot them down at their approach, without risking an exchange of bullets. As it was, a single bay of the beagle—their accustomed signal—was the only warning which the more busy robbers received from the companion who held the horses, and who occupied, with them and the carriage, the upper part of the road. The ruffian who bestrid the prostrate gentleman turned about at the signal, only to receive the bullet of Vernon, unerringly aimed at his head. He fell prostrate upon the body of the old man, and his blood and brains covered his face and garments. In the next moment, the robber in possession of the carriage fired at Vernon, and was about to leap with a second pistol upon him, when the appearance of Rawlins, who made his entrée with a shout which might have done credit to the lungs of Stentor, determined the assailant to trust his heels rather than his weapon; and without giving a look 20* to his comrade, he darted into the opposite woods, leaving the carriage between himself and his foes. He who held the horses, kept his ground until Rawlins had approached him within a few paces, when, lifting his weapon, with as deliberate an aim as the circumstances of his position would allow, he fired, but ineffectually, at the sturdy woodman. Could the latter have seen the bitter, nay, venomous, expression of face which the fellow gave him ere he shot, he would have congratulated himself, indeed, that it was not Rachel who had fallen into his hands. Vernon was the first to pursue the escaping ruffians, but he had scarcely entered the wood ere he felt himself growing sick and faint; and then, for the first time, he found himself wounded in the thigh. He returned to the scene of action, and with difficulty alighted from his horse. The old man and his daughters, whom he had rescued, came about him to acknowledge and thank him for his services; but exhaustion, from loss of blood, now overcame him, and he sunk to the ground with a dim consciousness while he was falling, that the old man was the very person whom he sought—the very William Maitland who had defrauded the bank and involved Carter, to the loss of so many thousands. But this impression soon gave place to another, and it seemed to the swooning youth that the features of the man were at once absorbed in those of a lovely virgin,—such a vision as had filled his dreaming fancy the night he slept at the hovel of Mrs. Yarbers;—a form of chiselled symmetry, and a face, of the exquisite beauty of which, the soul, alone, could feel the perfection and the charm, in those vague and spiritual imaginings which come to the youthful heart when it first dreams of love,—which come to it but once, and is believed by it for ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “Why do you strive so—whither would you fly? You cannot wrest yourself away from care, You may from counsel; you may shift your place, But not your person; and another clime Makes you no other.” Fletcher. The woodman, who had continued the pursuit of the ruffians without being at all apprised of the malicious aim of one of them upon him, from which he had been so fortunate as to escape, soon found his efforts unavailing to overtake them. They had made their way into a canebrake immediately contiguous, in whose thick, fostering glooms and secret abodes, they could easily defy and baffle the search of any hundred men. Ignorant of the hurt of Vernon, whom he had seen enter the forest in pursuit, like himself, he shook his hand in anger at the sheltering recesses in which the robbers were lost from sight, and returned towards the scene of action, with a degree of composure, which seemed to regard the fatigue of his horse as superior to all other considerations. His astonishment and concern, when he discovered the insensible condition of his companion, was worthy of a much longer acquaintance, and a more social and equal relationship than had existed between them. A few moments sufficed to convince him that his friend was not dead, nor, perhaps, badly injured; and a few more enabled him to kick the dead robber with a quiet conviction that he could do no more hurt. The features of the ruffian he inspected carefully; but if he had any knowledge of them before, he kept the matter to himself, and having emptied the pockets of all that they contained of value, and possessed himself of the pistols with which the fellow had been armed, but which the true and prompt shot of Vernon had prevented him from using, he left the carcass in the highway, with probably some such motive as that of the woodman when he kills a snake—namely, the start and momentary terror which such a spectacle will provoke in the spectator. This business was the work of a few moments only; and he now addressed himself seriously to the task of assisting his wounded companion, and directing the farther movements of the party, all the members of which were labouring under more or less excitement and apprehension. The whole scene was over in a few minutes, but the full pressure of its terrors and dangers had not passed entirely away. The old gentleman who had been rescued, was even then busy in cleansing his face and bosom, as well as he might, from the blood and brains of the slain robber which had spurted over them. He was a fine-looking man, of very venerable aspect; but there was an incertitude in his looks, and a tremulousness of limb in his movements, which seemed to the mind of the woodman strangely inconsistent with the fine, manly mould in which nature had cast his frame. It was also apparent to our forester that there was a fidgety uneasiness in his manner, which denoted apprehensions no less active at the moment of his rescue and seeming safety, than when he lay under the weapon of the robber. He spoke confusedly, yet not with rapidity; checked and interrupted himself repeatedly; caught up his speech before he had completed his sentences; corrected, or strove to correct his expression; and increased his confusion, as folks are very apt to do, by anticipating it. His determination on little matters seemed to undergo alteration quite as often as his speech; and in all that he said and did, he exhibited to the countryman, who was not entirely obtuse, that purposeless, imbecile character, which is conscious of much to be done, yet is capable of nothing, and despairs even while it undertakes, and falters before fatigue. Yet, so far as the ordinary circumstances are involved which produce fear in the minds of men, the stranger had shown himself hardy enough. It is true, he did not offer resistance to the robbers, though armed; but this arose as well from the manner in which he had been surprised by them, as from a proper conviction that he could not hope to resist them with any chance of success; and might, by doing so, have provoked their ill-treatment of his daughters, for whose safety he had shown all the solicitude of a father. He had not betrayed so much alarm for his own safety, while actually beneath the body of his assailant, as he did now, speaking of the event to the sturdy woodman, by whose assistance, in part, his rescue had been achieved. Indeed, his timidity, uneasiness and downcast looks while he spoke, surprised the latter quite as much as they vexed him; and his words were spoken with the view to reassuring the courage which he could not but think—and this too with some feelings of contempt,—had been quite too much cast down by the strife through which it had just gone. “There's no sort of danger now, old gentleman, while we're so strong around you. It won't be any two robbers of the Chitta-Loosa that'll venture to lay thumb and fingers on the nose of Wat Rawlins, and he with his eyes open. So since you're safe now, and don't seem to have lost any thing, take your seat in your wagon, while I help Vernon into the bottom of it. You must make some room for him, young lady, and don't be frightened at a little blood. It is good blood, and spilt in your own behalf, so you may look on it with a sort of pleasure, if you a'n't too faint-hearted,—which I don't think so much your case as that of the old gentleman. He's mighty uneasy now, though for what there's no telling. Why don't you mount, old gentleman, and put yourself in readiness.” In some agitation, the stranger turned to his daughter, and a brief conversation was carried on between the two in whispers. The woodman remarked that the fine eye of the maiden was kindled, her cheek flushed, and he could hear her distinctly exclaim, at the conclusion of a long and very earnest sentence, —“do not—do not think of such a thing, dear father; common humanity alone, were there no other reasons, should require this; now it is the due,—gratitude—” The rest of the words were lost to the listener, who, at the same time, busied himself in binding a handkerchief around the thigh of the youth in the hope to arrest the bleeding. While thus engaged, the traveller approached him, and asked how far they might be at that moment from the first ferry. The question surprised the woodman, who looked up at the speaker with increased surprise. With a mind so utterly unsophisticated as his own, he could conceive of no condition of things justifying the reluctance of the traveller to lend himself to the work of succouring one to whom he owed so great a service. His wonder, however, did not extend to the conduct of the elder maiden. She had stooped to assist him in his rude surgery, and had yielded the mantle from her shoulder to help in binding up the hurts of his patient. But his eye spoke to her father a different language from that which his lips addressed to her. To him he looked the surprise he felt, and something more. Scorn was mingled with his wonder, and anger rose no less upon his lips than upon his countenance. “The ferry!” he exclaimed; “the ferry! Why what the diccans can you be after? A'n't there time enough for that question to-morrow, or the next day, or the day after, or any day for the next six months to come? We can give you house-room, stranger, as I told you before, and keep you in the dry, though it rains rivers. There's old Billy Badger, that'll give you something more than a supper—a sermon with it—and be glad that you eat heartily, if you can hear well. Come, old man, give us a lift, while we set the lad in your wagon. He won't oncommode the ladies much, and if so be he does, it was all their own fault and yours, to git into difficulties, and he's hurt in gitting you out of them. Give us a lift, and look better pleased, and by gimini, I'll forget how little minded you seem to holp the man that holped you.” “Do my father no injustice,” interposed the elder maiden; “he is not indifferent to the fate of your friend—of our friend,—and will do what you require, and all that he can, for his succour and relief. Do not suppose, even had you not been nigh to urge it, that we should have needed any persuasion to move us to so necessary an act of duty. No, sir, believe me, had there been no better strength than that of my own feeble frame, that should have been given for his service, and though I sank beneath the burden, I should, at least, have done my utmost to find succour for one who has been of the greatest succour to us.” “I believe you, my dear young lady, I believe you; there's no mistake in your face; by the powers! I believe you jist as much as if your words had come from the lips of Rachel herself; but the old gentleman, why don't he spunk up, and lend a hand?” The keen eye of the woodman was fixed upon the traveller as he spoke these words. The latter became still more confused at the apostrophe; his glance sank to the ground, and he faltered out some only half-intelligible accents, about the necessity he was under of pursuing his journey, and the inconveniences which would arise to him, of any unexpected delay; and here he turned to his daughter, and proceeded to repeat what he had said to the woodman, touching the exigencies of his situation. The blunt language of Rawlins anticipated the maiden, and prevented her replying to a speech, which, though partially intelligible only, seemed greatly to distress her. “By the powers! old gentleman, to my thinking you have been saying any thing but the right thing. What are you talking about your journey for at this time, when here's the man that saved your throats, and your money, and may be, God only knows, saved this handsome young lady, that's your own daughter, from something worse than all. Here he is, I say, lying on the ground, knocked over in holping you out of the hobble, and wanting help himself now, to get him to a soft bed, and a quiet place to get well in. If it hadn't a-been for him, who knows what might have happened? It's true I was close behind, but my nag's not the creature that he rides. I'd ha' done as much for you as I could, but then he did it, and made no promises; so fall to, and give me a shoulder here, while I lift the lad into your wagon. The ladies can sit on one side, and we can lay him in the bottom; he's swoonded, and won't know any thing about it, and it's only two miles we've got to go.” “Two miles!” exclaimed the traveller, “is it only two miles to the ferry?” “Ferry! Why, what do you want with the ferry?” demanded Rawlins. “I must cross the ferry to-night,” returned the other. “You can't—you shan't! by all the powers you shan't! You shall carry the lad in your wagon to Billy Badger's, which is only two miles off, and it will be quite dark by the time we git there, for you'll have to go slow on account of the lad's hurts. After that, if you are so cursed hard-hearted, old gentleman, as to set off without waiting to know how the man is that resked his life to save yours and your daughter's, not to say nothing about your cash, which must be pretty considerable, to bring these robbers about you—” “You mistake, you mistake, my friend,” was the hasty interruption of the traveller, “I have but little money with me—precious little—nothing to speak of.” “Tell that to the chickens—the old fowls won't believe you. But that's neither here nor there. As for your crossing the ferry this night, that's impossible. Where would you have been, or what, let me ask you, would you have had to cross with, if the lad hadn't put in to save you? If you don't choose to do the thing willingly, by the powers, I'll do it for you. I'll take possession of your carry-all, and fix the thing to my own liking.” “Oh, my father, why will you resist?—why oppose any longer?” was the pleading inquiry of the elder maiden, whose own solicitations, though before chiefly whispered, as if in deference to her father's years and feelings, were as warm in expression, and as humane in their purport, as were those of the VOL. I. 21 more abrupt and sturdy woodman. “The gentleman says rightly,” continued the maiden, “we have all been saved by the valour of his companion, and we must see him carried safely to his dwelling. Nay, more, we cannot leave him till he is out of danger.” “Virginia, my child, what is it that you say? You know not my reasons—my necessity,” was the bewildered response of the father. “Nothing, my father, but absolute danger can justify inhumanity.” She laid down this just principle with due solemnity. “I am in danger,” whispered the father in her ear—“foes seek—evils beset—dangers follow me.” “God forbid! say not so!—your life—how?— from what?—from whom?—speak to me, dear father! Tell me all—now, now. Let me know wherefore this journey—why have you left your home—our dear home—in this strange and sudden manner?” The anxiety of the maiden almost overturned her caution. Her whispers became full and perfect sounds at the close, and were silenced in much agitation by the father, who pointed to Rawlins, now approaching with the body of Vernon, which he had lifted upon his massive shoulders, and was bearing to the carriage. The groan of the father was insuppressible. “Not now, my child, not now. We must submit to this. Take your seat; Ellen will sit on the front with me. The stranger speaks truly. It might have been, but for the youth's coming, that we had lost that which is of more value than life.” The parties were soon seated, and the cushions of the vehicle were made to support, in tolerable ease, the form of the wounded man, from whom an occasional escaping groan announced the lingering presence of life within him. Having effected all the arrangements, to his own satisfaction at least, Rawlins took charge of Vernon's horse, which he led; and congratulating the old man upon his slowly-recovered humanity, he proceeded to guide him to the dwelling which he had assigned for their temporary lodging-house, leaving the dead robber to the possible care of his comrades. “By the powers! old gentleman,” said he, with an air of great tolerance, as he rode up beside the vehicle, and looked in upon the face of his companion, “it was only because of the young ladies that I let you off so easily. When you wanted to back out, and leave the lad in his blood, when he had just done getting you out of a mighty ugly scrape, I had it in mind to make you walk your own trotters, and take the wagon to myself all together; for, you see, it would have been mighty shameful in you to go off in safety, not asking and not caring what became of him that helped you. If you had seen him ride as I did, when he heard the screams of the ladies, and seen his face when he spoke, and heard his words when he cried to me that was riding close behind him, `a woman's voice, Rawlins!'— Rawlins is my name, sir—you would say to yourself, `by the powers! this is the very sort of man to wrap up in your heart, and to love,' and I love him, stranger, by the powers!—I love the lad for what I've seen him do to-day, jist the same as if I know'd him for a hundred years, though I never set eyes on him afore to-day.” “He is a stranger, then, in this neighbourhood?” was the inquiry of the old gentleman. “A traveller, like yourself; he comes from below —I reckon from some of the old states, for he's got a sight of larning, knows every thing, and talks jist like a book.” The eyes of the elder maiden were fixed for awhile with increasing interest upon the pale countenance of the wounded man, and she now remarked the finely formed and expressive features—expressive even while overspread by a pallor such as that of death—the softness and fineness of his skin, the small, sweet mouth, and the flowing locks of hair which escaped in small, single ringlets from the confining cap which he wore, but which had been displaced by the motion of the carriage. The instincts of women are no less busy and prompt than those of men, else why should the maiden blush when she beheld the eyes of the woodman suddenly cast upon her, as she scanned the features of his unconscious companion? She had, with equal suddenness, arrived at the conviction that the face of the stranger youth was one of the most noble she had ever seen, and distinguished by that delicacy of feature and expression which are conjectured to denote equally aristocratic birth and natural genius. This conviction was, perhaps, strengthened by the few words which Rawlins had spoken, and which represented the youth as a traveller like themselves. Imagination soon busied itself to discover his objects, his pursuits, family, and mental resources; and even when the searching glance of the woodman compelled her to avert her eyes to the opposite side of the carriage from the wounded man, the subject was too interesting to suffer her to forego its consideration, which employed her young thoughts and virgin fancies in a manner which did not please the less because they lacked all means for arriving at any conclusion. The carriage reached Zion's Hill— the name which the strongly assured Methodist had conferred upon his habitation—and yet Virginia Wilson—for Wilson was the name given by her father, as his own, in reply to the demand of Rawlins —with a tenacity which is probably rational enough among young ladies in all such cases, had not yet exhausted her subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Wolsey. — Sir, For holy offices I have a time; a time To think upon the part of business which I bear i' the state. King Henry VIII. The party was received very cordially, though with great solemnity, by the sober Methodist. He descended from his steps to the carriage; freely welcomed the proprietor; commanded all care for the wounded man; bade his servants in attendance; had refreshments served, and though, in these respects, exhibiting the essentials of a most solid and earnest hospitality, he never yet unbent a muscle of his hard countenance, nor modulated to softness the harsh accents of a voice, stern, cold, slow, emphatic, and measuredly monotonous. He listened to the unusual narrative of their escape, with the same composure as he would have heard the complaints of his niece, Rachel, who had pricked her finger with a needle; and his congratulations to the party on their escape, were uttered with very much like the manner which he employed when saying grace before the morning meal. A matter-of-fact face received every circumstance, and requited all the wonders which he heard; and nothing in the world could be more mortifying to the enthusiastic temperament, than the repulsive and chilling expression of a countenance 21* that seemed to be set on high, as a sort of moral scarecrow, to rebuke the intrusive passions; the fervid temperament; the glowing and impatient zeal, that burns, and swells, and bounds, and is never so angry as when it encounters the high fences which prudence sets up to restrain its roving and incursive propensities. William Badger had no sympathy with the enthusiasm that dilates readily at every impulse. His enthusiasm was all religious; his zeal, deep, earnest, and perpetually glowing, was restrained by that decorum alone, which is the fruit of intense veneration. To speak fast, seemed to his mind to indulge in levity; to utter promptly his feelings, might be to do injustice to his own judgment, to the governing providence of God, or to the rights and interests of others. It may be added, that, with a temperament sanguine in the extreme; a mind free, full and active; an intense self-esteem, and that disposition to sway which is, perhaps, a natural attribute of such a character, his impetuosity of disposition was simply methodized and more completely systematized and made equal from the external restraints put upon it. “I have seen him in a roaring passion,” said Rawlins to his companion, “when he didn't know what he said or did, and swore like a Massissippi boatman; and yet one word came out after another jist as slowly as if he was making his morning prayer. He's a most strange man, that same Billy Badger; but he means always to do right, even when he's most wrong; and if you'll let him alone, when he's most wrong, he'll come right after a season; but I do think he'd not suffer the angel Gabriel to set him right, or show him that he was wrong, one minute before he was willing to see it for himself.” The first care of all parties was to see into the condition and render assistance to the wounded man. He was conveyed into a quiet chamber, and Badger himself attended chiefly to his hurts. An inspection of them showed him to have been wounded by two balls, both of which had fortunately struck fleshy parts of the thigh, and the swooning had been occasioned by the loss of blood, and not in consequence of any serious causes of exhaustion. When the venerable elder had satisfied himself of these facts, he made very light, in his solemn manner, of the danger, and assured the anxious Rawlins that the youth would scarcely feel his hurts in a day or two. The balls not having lodged, but, having cut the flesh in two parallel spots, some two inches apart, it was easy to dress the wounds, which had already ceased to pour forth those free streams which, at first, had threatened to exhaust the fountains of life within him, and might have done so, but for the timely bandaging that Rawlins had made both below and above the places which were hurt. Badger, who asked no counsel of those around him, administered a sleeping draught to the patient, which silenced the groans, at moments escaping feebly from his lips, and set him to sleep so soundly that there was but little prospect,—according to the woodman,—of his hearing any of the long sermon that night. To do Mr. Wilson all manner of justice, we may say, that he showed no lack of interest in the situation of the young man. He watched beside him until Badger had declared his perfect conviction of his safety, and then left him only to quiet the becoming anxiety of another, whose solicitude in his fate, which might have seemed improper under other circumstances, found its sufficient justification in her gratitude. Virginia Wilson felt a strange beating at her heart, and trembled with a new sentiment of pleasure, as she listened to these tidings. Was there any thing singular in the fact that she retired that instant to the chamber which had been assigned herself and younger sister, and shed in secret those tears which it might have puzzled her to explain why she shed at all. Yet such was the case, and those tears, it may be added, were no less sweetly strange to her own heart, than they would have been surprising to any other not perfectly conscious of their source. Meanwhile, Mr. Wilson and our friend Rawlins were compelled to undergo the protracted examination of the Methodist, on the subject of the late adventure; the circumstances of which seemed to awaken in him no less curiosity than concern. “Evil is abroad in the world,” he said, beginning to sermonize at the conclusion of his examination; “there is no place altogether secure from the dominion of Satan; but that here, so nigh unto Zion, where I have, for the space of two blessed years, striven to uphold the work and the worship of our heavenly father; that sin should so boldly demean herself, seems to be as passing strange, as it is sad. But, marvel ye not, Walter Rawlins, at what I am about to say to you; and regard it not as unbecoming in one who preaches peace on earth and goodwill to all men, if I declare to you that we must all arise, and put on the armour of strife, yea, the very armour of man, and gird upon our thighs the carnal weapons of human wrath. The traveller must not be stricken down upon the highway without summons of eternity, without warning to prepare for death in season. We must go forth in seeking for these bloody men; we must put them to defiance, and as they have not hearkened to our words of prayer and peace, neither have they given heed to the forbearance of our own example, then must we use against them the same weapons which they are so ready to use against the wayfaring man, and we must smite them hip and thigh to their utter undoing. If they will not hearken to the imploring angel; if they will not heed the promise of the forgiving angel; nor incline their hearts to the prayers of the righteous, God will commission the destroying angel, even as he hath commissioned him against the Amalekite and the Assyrian of old, until there be none left to tell the story of their undeserving, and their heaped-up bones alone shall remain to declare their sudden punishment, in warning to the other tribes of evildoers which shall follow them. Truly, it grieves me, that here, within sight of the Hill of Zion, which I had thought to set apart as a spot where evil should not have foothold or countenance, such deeds should be done as shall make the traveller tremble to approach, even when he comes on the sabbath, seeking crumbs of comfort from the Lord. My heart is full of shame within me, that I should have fought the good fight with so feeble an arm, and should have gone into the battle with a spirit waxing faint in the hour when there is most need of performance. Here, Mr. Wilson, with the Lord's favour, did I pitch my tent, at a time when the land around me was in possession of the heathen, though even then decreed for the heritage of the believing. Well may I declare that it was like unto a desert, where the dews of heavenly bounty never fell, or if they fell, which were drunk up without profit to earth or heaven by the thirsty, but unimproving lands. Since that time, the heathen hath sunk away from the broad possession of the land, and hath given place to a people, which, if they be not yet holy, were yet better favoured of God with the true lights of righteousness. Many, I am glad to declare, have had the fountains of life to spring up within their hearts, with a streaming which shall never fail; but as thou seest, there are many still who grope in the ways of darkness, and fight under the banners of the mighty sinner who first made all to sin. These robbers who have assailed, with design, perchance, to slay—” The harangue which, temperately begun, promised to be of interminable dimensions, was here cut short by the interruption of one who had entered without being seen by the elder. This was his own son, Gideon, a youth of twenty years or thereabouts, whom Rawlins had already described as a “sly fellow, having something wrong about him,” and one whom he did not like. The youth was a proper-looking youth enough; but his keen, quick eye, the lively play of temper about his mouth, the sudden transition of expression in his glance, his studious methodism in garb and accent, so much at variance with the natural characteristics of his countenance and manner, would have impressed a close spectator with a conviction of the perfect felicity of Rawlins' brief, but comprehensive description. He sat demurely in the seat which he had taken at entrance, immediately behind his father; his hands were clasped upon his knees, his legs drawn up, and half inclined beneath his chair, his eyes cast down upon the floor even while he spoke. His interruption arose quite as much, if the truth was known, from his impatience at a sort of exhortation, in which, whatever might be the case with the traveller, his experienced ears found little of novelty; and though, in what he said, he fancied he should gratify the amour propre of the veteran religionist, his aim was, perhaps, simply to suppress a discourse, of which the reader has probably had quite as much as himself, and may thank him for the interruption. “It may be, sir, that you are doing some injustice to your own labours, and to the character of the goodly neighbourhood in which we live. I am of the opinion, sir, that these robbers must be strangers in these parts, the outcasts from other states and cities, men of desperate hope and fortune, who rove the country like raging lions seeking whom they shall devour, and none of whom have ever hearkened to your voice, or to the wholesome preaching of any of God's servants. I cannot think that any of those whom we are accustomed to behold at Zion's Hill, hearkening to the word, will ever be found in the evil ways of these wretched robbers.” The lurking tribute to the old man's vanity which was contained in this speech, did not do away with the impertinence of the interruption. The father, slowly and without a word, when he first heard the voice of the son, wheeled his chair about so that he might face the speaker. He heard him patiently to the end, and then answered him in grave, stern accents. “And what know you, Gideon Badger, of the hearts of men, even though they be neighbours unto Zion's Hill? And what know you of these robbers, of whom you speak so readily, that you should venture to hope—ay, sir, I say, to hope—that all or even any of those who hearken to God's word in this place, are free from the damnable leprosy of sin? There is a great presumption in thy thoughts, Gideon Badger, which should be chastened by prayer, by the prayer of an anguished spirit, that knows its own presumption, and can find no check to chasten it but that which is the free gift of God himself. When thou speakest so freely of the goodness of thy neighbours, I greatly fear thou speakest a vain thing. There are many among them, whom I fear lack overmuch the becoming humility of God's servants, and need the visitation of the Saviour in their secret places, before they will hold up clean hands and pure hearts in the sight of their heavenly Maker. Nay, more, Gideon Badger, it is thy practice to seek and commune with some of those of whom but little that is good may be spoken. There is that idle man who lives by taking the innocent fish that swim to and fro in the Chitta-Loosa, which, though it bears a name of the heathen, is yet no less a river of the Lord— he whom they call Weston, whose blacksmith craft were of great profit to him would he pursue it, is another of whom it were well if thou hadst less knowledge—” Here the old man experienced another interruption, but this time from no less a person than our friend Rawlins. “He will have no more knowledge of Weston,” said the woodman, “than he has already, and that I can give you now, since Weston was the very man who was shot down by Mr. Vernon:—he sat on the top of the old gentleman, there, Mr. Wilson, with pistol out, and another loaded in his breast, when Vernon tumbled him. Here are the pistols which I took from him, here's his knife, and these nick-nacks also came out of his pocket. His carcass lies in the cross-roads at this moment, where any body who wants, can have it for the carriage.” This revelation startled the Methodist out of something of his equanimity. He half rose from his seat while Rawlins spoke, but instantly resuming it, as if conscious of improper precipitancy of movement, he sat quietly, without farther motion, until the tale was finished; his eyes meanwhile wandering, with obvious anxiety in their glance, from the speaker to his son, and from him again to the speaker. When the latter had finished his statement, and thrown down upon a table the arms and other articles which he had taken from the slain robber, the old man spoke, but his voice and manner had resumed all their deliberateness. “Walter Rawlins, this is a dreadful tale which thou tellest, and I tremble to hear it, as I cannot doubt that thou tellest me the truth.” “True as gospel, Mr. Badger, if eyes don't cheat one in the business.” “Make no irreverent comparisons, young man, between such truth which thou tellest, on the authority of thy mortal sight, and that wondrous truth of the gospel which comes of the sight of God. Thy truth hath its use and its value, and I question it not, but the truth of eternity is another thing from the truth of time, and God strengthen the poor eyes that see but the one, that they be not blinded with the outer brightness and perfection of the other. Truly, I make no doubt that thou hast seen this wretched man, Weston, in the condition which thou describest, though it is a sinful scorn of God's best work on earth to leave the frame even of the wicked man to rot above the earth, a prey to the carrion birds and beasts who prowl by night for food. His burial must be seen to, his proper burial; and we shall commit him to his final resting-place, with a prayer for mercy, though cut off in the very acting of his miserable crime. Gideon Badger, Gideon Badger, my son, give thanks to God this night that my timely warning to thee against this man severed the association between ye, else it might have ripened into an intimacy with the same sins on thy part, and may have been followed by a death to thee no less sudden than it has been to him, a death without repentance and without hope. Truly, thy tidings, Walter Rawlins, are full of terror. This is an awful visitation. In the midst of life we are in death. We know not the hour, yet we must obey the summons, however sudden. This miserable creature—well that he hath no parent to sorrow for his sudden smiting, and his unatoned sins; he hath no hope of sympathy and sorrow from us—the law of God and the law of VOL. I. 22 man command us otherwise. We are called upon to exult in the death of the evildoer, to rejoice in the downfall of sin,—but we must put the dead out of our sight. Earth to earth, dust to dust; and it differs not though the earth be that of the sinner. We are all sinners, even when we are best; redeemed through grace and mercy, and not because of our own righteousness. Let us go forth and put our brother in sin into the grave, with a prayer for mercy to him and to ourselves. Order you the hands together, Gideon Badger, and bid them provide themselves with torches. Let Timothy and Ephraim bring pick and spade, that we may not waste precious time.” Gideon Badger went slowly to the performance of this duty, and some time elapsed before the party was in readiness. Leaving his guests in charge of his niece, Rachel, of whom the garrulous Walter Rawlins has permitted us to know something already, Mr. Badger mounted his steed, a heavy, English-built animal, sturdy, and slow, and solemn, like himself, and set forth with all the phlegmatic deliberation of manner which distinguished the ancient puritan going forth to battle. There were not wanting other matters to strengthen this similitude. He carried a pair of wide-mouthed iron horse-pistols at his saddle-bow, a pair which he had borne with him into battle when, in his younger days, he followed the banner of Andrew Jackson, among the mounted men of Coffee's brigade, and went down from Tennessee to the fierce and close combats on the Tallapoosa. Nor did he forget to take with him on this occasion the knotted hickory, a massive club, almost of the thickness of his wrist, which, as the supposed characteristic of a hero whom he regarded with a large degree of veneration, he had made his own inseparable companion, not simply in times of danger, but on all occasions. “And danger,” said the old Methodist, defending the propriety of this practice, “is even like sin, a thing of all occasions. The man of wisdom borrows his lessons from the Christian, and goes armed and ready at all times for the enemy. There is no telling at what moment we may meet with him, nor in what shape; whether he shall appear as the wild beast of the wilderness, or as the wretched robber, seeking for your substance. Therefore, I say to you, be ye always ready.” He was attended by his son Gideon, and Walter Rawlins, both equally well armed with himself, and followed by some six or eight negro men, his entire force of males, some of them bearing lightwood torches, and the rest, the necessary implements for breaking the mould, and preparing the place of interment. They traversed the path in silence and without interruption, but, to the astonishment of all, the dead robber was no where to be found. The traces of the conflict were numerous—the blood lay in clotted masses on the sand and leaves; but neither on the spot where he had been described as having fallen, nor in the immediately contiguous bushes of the forest, could they find traces of his mode of disappearance. “How know you that his wounds were death-wounds, Walter Rawlins?” demanded the Methodist. “May it not be that he hath feigned death while ye were present, having no serious hurt, and hath stolen away from the place of battle, the moment ye had all gone from sight?” “If he did,” replied Rawlins with a hearty laugh, “he was able to do with less brains than any man I ever heard tell of before. But there's no danger of that; his skull was crunched by the bullet, and a piece of it was wanting—clean blown off,—as large as a table-spoon. Besides, I felt at his heart more than once, while I was searching his pockets, for I didn't want that a dead man even should open his eyes and catch me stripping him. The beat was all gone out of his breast, before I come up from chasing his brother rascals.” “Verily, Walter, thou couldst not have chased them to a great distance, for they have surely returned to his assistance, and it is by their help that he hath been taken away.” “Like enough, sir; but I did give 'em a chase, and a mighty close one for the time I took about it. I wasn't going to run 'em fifty miles, when dark was coming on, and my company was waiting for me in the open road. Besides there was little chance, if I didn't tree 'em at the first jump, that I should find 'em, me one only, in a close thicket like that. That canebrake would hide a hundred rascals from the most honest nose among us all.” “It needs not that we should speak longer in this idle fashion: thou hast too great a vanity of thy speech, Walter Rawlins. It is a sin in youth to multiply words, having neither experience nor thinking to make them stable and of fitting effect. Thou shouldst better prefer to hear the language of wisdom, in the counsels of age. Years must pass over thee, and thou must clothe thyself in holiest meditation, even as with a shrouding garment, which shall wrap thee in from all worldly shows and affinities, before it will be thy right, or in any wise becoming in thee, to speak freely in the presence of men, or confidently among their counsels. I will speak more to thee of this subject on the way homeward. Turn thy horse, therefore, which improperly crosseth the path, so that I may advance before thee. It is, perhaps, well that we are not required to perform this awful ceremony of committing dust to dust. Let the dead bury the dead; these are the written words, which truly signify that the wicked should take upon themselves the task of putting their fellow-sinners from sight. Yet, young men, the ceremony of human burial is not an unfitting spectacle for the young and erring like yourselves, and had these wretched people left to us the task of committing their slain comrade to the earth, I should have striven to fill your minds with the goodly workings of religious truth. Ye should have had ample premonition of the fate of wickedness, so that your hearts might have been touched in season, and your souls warned with a righteous fear, which should have moved you in all haste to fly from the wrath which is to come. Nay, there is yet time for this, and, God willing, young men, this shall be the subject of our evening exhortation, ere we seek our rest this night.” An audible groan burst from the lips of Gideon Badger, which the father ascribed naturally enough to the solemn and sad course of meditation which his words had inspired in the breast of the youth. The less rigid mind of Walter Rawlins referred it to a more simple, and perhaps, equally natural cause —the terror which such a threat was always calculated to awaken in his own bosom, seemed quite sufficient to justify the audibly expressed tribulation of Gideon. If he suspected the latter of a little hypocrisy, he gave him credit, at least, for a certain degree of sympathy with himself in the unfavourable estimate which he had made of the elder's solemn outpourings, —the chief objection to which, in his mind, consisted in the fact that they occupied time which could be much more pleasantly disposed of, in communion with one whose discourse, if less saintly, was far more sweet, and whose periods were uttered with less elaborate lips, and closed sometimes with far more pleasant emphasis. 22* “But if the disappearance of this slain robber relieves us of one duty, Walter Rawlins,” continued the old man in a different strain of thought, “it seems to impress upon us the necessity of other duties, no less painful, and perhaps, more full of trouble and danger. It is clear that the companions of this robber bear the name of legion—they are many, since they attack the traveller in troops and squadrons—they are bold, since they attack him in the broad daylight, and near unto the very foot of Zion's hill—nor, doth their boldness appear less remarkable from the fact that they have scarcely been driven from their prey, with the loss of one slain from their number, before they return to the spot and carry him away in safety. This conduct betokeneth the insolence of numbers. Doubtless, they came hither after your departure with a force increased sufficiently to enable them to avenge their loss. The madness of wickedness would not stop even at the wanton and useless repetition of their crime. All this calleth loudly for exertion among the true peacemakers, the righteous, and well-wishing among mankind, and for the suppression of these evildoers, the neighbours must be stirred up into activity and wrath. Rumours have reached me before this, of a gathering of evil men along this heathen river; and now, when it cometh so nearly to our own doors, it behoveth me as a magistrate under an earthly ruler, no less than as one commissioned by the Most High, to search into this sin, with keen eyes and a sleepless spirit. Of this we must have speech and counsel to-morrow, giving our prayerful application to the Lord Jesus ere we lie down to-night, that the right wisdom may fill our understandings, so that we fall upon the fitting purpose, and take our way along the only path. Bid the hands follow, Gideon Badger—they loiter idly with their torches, and their voices swell into unruly sounds that are scarcely seemly in this solemn hour.” They had scarcely gone from sight, when three men, well armed, emerged from the edge of the swamp thicket. “By the Dog Shadow of Loosa-Chitta,” said one whose voice announced no other person than our old acquaintance, Saxon, “Badger deals in no small shot; he's a hundred pounder parson, and I shall owe him large acknowledgments, when next I find it needful to become ghostly and unctuous. That Gideon is a precious rascal; he groaned most piteously, as if no river could wash the salt savour and the true leaven out of him. Yet you tell me he scampered off rather fast, Burritt?” “Ay, as fast as two slender shanks could carry a small body and a frightened heart. We put him at the easiest business, only to hold the horses, while Weston grappled the old man, and I looked for the cash. With the first sound of the enemy, he was off.” “And had this old man any cash?” “I'm afraid not, or he hid it too snugly for us to find it in a hurry. The watch was all I brought off, and that I pulled from the daughter's side almost without her knowing it.” “Well, say nothing reproachfully of Gideon; coward or not, he is of too much use to us, while his father lives, to suffer us to complain of his little deficiencies. The old man is no coward, that is clear, and would go as heartily into a fight, as he goes into a sermon. He would fight like a bull-dog. The young fellow who gave Weston his quietus—you are sure you shot him?” “If aim was ever good, mine was upon his breast-button.” “Well, it is, perhaps, quite as well that it is all over. If he's dead, it's one out of the way that I suspect would have been very troublesome to us; if not, as old Badger would tell you, you have not the heavier sin to answer for. But, dead or alive, it is still important that we should see what papers he carries; we must see what beagles are down in the Governor's catalogue. Gideon may get these papers without much risk, and when there's no danger, there will be little fear. We must summon him to-night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. “A fair, young, modest damsel I did meet; She seemed to all a dove, when I passed by, And I to all a raven.” Thomas Decker. That night, Gideon Badger encountered Rachel Morrison, his cousin, as she wandered forth into the shady grove of forest trees, which were allowed to remain at the clearing, and conducted from the house into the garden. The youth had evidently placed himself in waiting, as he sprang from the deep shadow of an oak at her approach, and presented himself before her. She started at sight of him, with a feeling of mixed indignation and surprise. Her form, rather inclining to be tall and masculine, seemed to rise in majesty beyond its wont, the moment she recovered from her partial surprise, and the tones of her voice, and the words she used, at once indicated a condition of quasi warfare between them. “Why will you still pursue, still oppress me in this manner, Gideon Badger?” “Why will you still seek to avoid me in this manner, Rachel Morrison?” was his reply. “If it be true that I seek to avoid you, you, as a man, should scorn to pursue me. Your own pride should preserve me from your persecution, even if your sense of generosity failed you. Will you not suffer me to pass?” “No! not yet—not for a while. I would speak further, with you, Rachel, and you must bear with my persecutions a little longer, for a very good reason.” “Let me know the reason, Gideon Badger, and if it be a good one, rest assured that I will remain and hear you without reluctance. Until then, you must forgive me if I say, I hear you with little pleasure.” “I doubt not that, Rachel,” returned the young man gloomily, “there is another whose speech and presence have ever given you more pleasure than mine. It is reason enough why you should remain, that you cannot so easily escape, and that I am resolved that you shall hear me; and yet, I would that you were more yielding to other reasons, which are enough, not only to persuade you to stay and hear, but to do so with pleasure and content.” “I know not these, Gideon,—I would that I did. Heaven knows how willingly I should incline my ears to the words of one so dear to my uncle as yourself. But you well know what better reasons I have for distrusting your speech and avoiding your company.” “By heavens, Rachel, but you do me wrong! Because of one error,—one crime, if it please you so to call it,—am I to forfeit all your regard, all indulgence, all hope? You know that I have broken off from all intimacy with the man Furst. From that moment when you discovered our connexion, and the offence of which we were guilty, I promised you, and my promise has been kept rigidly.” “And yet, Gideon, the fate of another of your intimates alarms me—this unhappy man, Weston.” “Rachel, Rachel! can it be that you would couple me with that robber? Can you suppose me lost to all reason as well as to all religion? Can it be that you hold me a confederate of this unhappy wretch, when you know that I have not been seen with him for months?” “You have!” was her stern and startling reply to the warm and earnest asseverations of the youth, given with all the seeming unaffectedness of truth. “You have been seen with him, Gideon, within three weeks.” “Ha! who says it?—how know you?” “Mother Kerrison saw you with him at the ferry, three weeks ago.” “Pshaw, Rachel, how anxious must you be to find out faults in me, when you fall upon such idle tales as these. For that matter, I have seen the man almost weekly every month in the past year, but we have had no intimacy, no communion together, we have been in no wise associated.” “Gideon, there again I must oppose the testimony of a third person to your own. Who caught those fish which you brought home with you last Saturday was a week?” A bitter scowl passed over the countenance of the youth as he replied— “Truly, Rachel, you are in no lack of spies upon my actions. I suppose it will be in vain to deny that they were caught by Weston.” “It will, indeed, be vain to deny it, Gideon, and my good reasons for seeking to avoid you, arise from your having done so already. Your father was under the persuasion that you caught them by your own hands.” “I never told him so,” said the young man hastily. “No, but your words justified his belief that such was the case, and he spoke of your success in fishing to your own ears, and you did not seek to set him right.” “And I am successful in fishing, Rachel, and his compliments were just enough; as for my statement misleading him, I can only say that I never intended it should. But you know, I see, that the fish were brought from Weston.” “I know that you got them from him, but I heard that they were given to you.” “Now, in the name of all that is precious in a spy, what old woman could have told you this?— Mother Kerrison, again?” “It was, indeed, no other.” “That old hag ought to be carted through a cane-brake, and drawn through the bog. The fish were bought with money, Rachel Morrison, and I trust there's no more harm in buying fish from a man that turns out to be a rogue, than in buying them from the best citizen in the county. That you hate me, Rachel, is sufficiently clear from the collection of authorities and arguments which you have got together against me.” “Gideon, God knows, and you ought to know, that I have had, in the kindness of your father to the poor orphan of his brother's wife, every reason to make me try to love and to esteem you; and I know, however little you may be disposed to believe it, how much I have tried to love you. But you have not suffered me to do this. Your own wilfulness, your harshness,—shall I say your cold, calculating artfulness of conduct in relation to your father, myself, and others, but your father chiefly—have baffled the desires of my heart. I cannot love, I cannot honour you—nay, I cannot look on you without shrinking and shuddering—when I know how prone you have shown yourself to speak the thing which is not, and to do the thing which you are commanded by God and man not to do. But if these reasons were not wanting, Gideon, to make me desirous to shun you, there were others, sufficient for my justification, in your caprice and violence of temper. You have striven to use me as your plaything; you have tried to abuse my ignorance, to take advantage of me as a child, and when you have failed in this, you have railed at me in ruffianly terms, as if I, too, were a ruffian. It were conclusive against your claim to manliness, that you have pursued this course of conduct, even while I have been in your father's house, protected by his favour, and almost dependant on his bounty. Be assured, Gideon Badger, that it was in my necessity, only, that I have remained and endured this treatment in silence. I could not have done so, had the dwelling of any other relative been open to my entrance, where I might have escaped such persecution.” “Ay, ay, Rachel Morrison, this is all very strong, and very emphatic,” said the youth, with mocking bitterness; “it is, as the old man, my venerable father, would call it, a searching and soul-harrowing discourse; but it may be that you have still left unspoken some of the grounds which induced your hatred of Gideon Badger.” “I hate you not, Gideon,” said the maiden, mournfully. “Alas! it is my great sorrow that you will not suffer me to love you.” “Nay, nay, Rachel, these sounds do not delude me. As I was saying, some of your reasons for rating me so humbly—so scornfully, should be the word—were unexpressed. You love another, Rachel Morrison, you love this swaggering fellow, Rawlins; deny it if you can.” “I seek not to deny it, Gideon.” “It were in vain to do so. I have seen you together; your heads and hands mingling, your forms linked,—ay, you may well shrink and blush while I say it, Rachel Morrison—your mutual lips glued to VOL. I. 23 each other as if they were never more destined to undergo separation.” The maiden did blush at the description of these scenes of secret tenderness which she had fancied utterly unseen by any eyes but those of heaven, and which, in the purity of her heart and its emotions, she had neither shame nor scruple that heaven should behold; but when her accuser spoke of her blushes, and counselled her to shame, her lofty spirit rose in majesty, her heart swelled with the pride of innocence, her form dilated in towering beauty, and she retorted the insolence of the speaker with well-deserved scorn. “And if I blush, Gideon Badger, at these scenes, it is not because they have been witnessed, but that such as you should have witnessed them. You, without sympathy for truth and virtue, would only mock the sincere heart by your jest, or offend it by your presence. A noble witness had gone from the spot in silence, and in his secret soul had locked up the remembrance of what his eyes had beheld unwittingly. Certainly, he would never have laboured as you have done, to make a woman regret that she had yielded herself to those feelings which, while they are pure in the sight of God, should be held no less sacred in the sight of man. To Walter Rawlins I am pledged—betrothed—it needs but the sanction of religion to make us one. We are already one in spirit and in truth—with God's blessing we shall soon be one in law.” “Never, never!” cried the youth impetuously, with choking accents, and the fierce gesticulation of one threatening an enemy. “Hear me, Rachel Morrison, you shall never wed this man. One or both of us shall first perish. I hate him now, as I have ever hated him, but with a hatred that will no longer brood and slumber over baffled hopes, and ineffectual purposes. If you resolve as you declare, then shall my equal resolution follow hard upon your declaration. Be sure that no peace which I can disturb shall dwell with you—no hope that I can banish shall warm your dwelling—no happiness follow your marriage with this man. Nay, there shall be no security. I will pursue you to the uttermost ends of the earth, but I will wrest you from his grasp; I will pursue him to the uttermost ends of the earth, but I will paralyze his embrace; and, if I cannot triumph in love, at least I will do so in the exercise of the most despotic hate. You know what I can do— you know my powers and my passions. Beware how you drive me to desperation—beware how you compel me to hate, when you know how heartily I can love.” “And know me also,” replied the woman with tremulous but measured and subdued accents, “know, Gideon Badger, that you can no more terrify Rachel Morrison than you can terrify the man who is pledged to be her husband. In God is my trust, and with a proper confidence in his power to save, I bid defiance to all your powers to wrong and to destroy. He hath strengthened me to bear with many afflictions, with poverty, with evil tongues,—even with dangers that might have stricken and destroyed— he will sustain me in flight, he will defend me against the pursuer, even if earthly powers should not avail for my protection. Yet, let me warn you, Gideon Badger, against this evil resolution. A word from me to Walter Rawlins, and his foot were upon your neck the instant after it was spoken.” “What! would you so soon threaten me with your bully, Rachel Morrison?—But I fear him not—” “Enough!” she exclaimed, interrupting the farther course of his insolent speech—“let us part, Gideon. You can say nothing more that can move me now.” “Nay, Rachel,—you madden me. Why provoke me thus when you know my passions?” “Your passions shall never be my tyrants, Gideon Badger; and you, who know so well how to conceal them in the presence of your father, exhibit but a poor sort of manliness when you refuse to restrain them in the presence of a woman. Let us separate, since it seems impossible for you to forbear language which it gives me pain to hear. Let us separate, but not in anger. I forgive you, Gideon; and if there be one thing more productive than another of sorrow in my heart, it is that you should so sinfully and perversely cast your good mind and better nature beneath the trampling foot of passions which first degrade and afterwards destroy. Why, Gideon, why,—son of my second father—why will you profligately cast away the noblest gift of God, the noble reason, and madden thus in a hopeless pursuit of that which it is beyond your power to procure?” “Be not certain of that! It is not beyond my power, Rachel Morrison—once more I tell you, you shall never wed this man.” “What mean you? Twice, Gideon, have you spoken in this strange, wild manner. Do you threaten his life or mine? Can it be that you mean to murder us?” “Murder, indeed!” he responded with a hollow laugh. “Who said that? Not I, Rachel, not I— your fancy is at work, and upon this slender stock you will get up a pretty tale before morning. No! no! I have no design to murder. I have no idea of shedding blood; but—ha!” The bay of the beagle arose faintly from the forest, swelled over the garden, and tremblingly fell upon their ears through the umbrageous tree-tops that sheltered them in their conference. A pause ensued, broken by neither for an instant. He then continued:— “Enough for warning, Rachel,—enough. You will think upon it and be wise. You know it is the wish of my father that you should be my wife, and my own love should move you to yield willingly to his wishes.” “Your love, Gideon Badger! Speak of the love of the storm for the flower which it rends in its rude embrace;—speak of the love of the ocean for the poor bark which it swallows up;—speak of any thing which makes a sport, a victim, of the object which it destroys, and you then speak of your love for me. Your passions, not your love, are busy in all this. It is they who would be my master, as they are your own. But they never shall. I will convince you, Gideon, though I weep for you with a sad sickness of heart all the while, that when you are most ungovernable in your rage, I can be calm and unmoved by your fury; when you are most angry, I shall be least moved; and when, to others and to yourself, you seem most fearful, then shall you behold the orphan of your father's bounty most fearless and secure. I praise God that he has given me a strength of soul which enables me, whatever may be the terror and the danger, to keep in the way which my heart tells me is right. With this consciousness, you cannot affright me, you can no more drive me from my resolution, than you can persuade me from the truth.” “You speak boldly, but you know me not. The time will come when you shall know more. But not yet—not now. Hark! I hear the whistle of your lover —he is summoning you to your old place of meeting. Make the most of your time, Rachel Morrison, for, 23* by the dim lights that will look down upon your endearments, they are destined not to last.” In another instant the maiden, stunned and oppressed with painful emotions and troubling fears, found herself utterly alone. Slowly she made her way to the garden, where, in a little time, she was joined by her lover. Gideon Badger, meanwhile, leaping the little worm-fence that ran along the lower limits of the enclosure, was lost from view in the forest, where his own voice, a moment after the woods had enshrouded him, might have been heard in responsive echoes to those mysterious bayings of the beagle which had summoned him to a meeting of his confederates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. “Gentlemen, have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?” Shakspeare. With the dawn of the day following, the traveller, Wilson, with his two daughters, prepared to resume their journey. The impatience of this gentleman seemed to grow with each moment of delay, and the protracted exhortations of the hospitable Methodist, who proved no less liberal of his counsel than he had shown himself of his meat, contributed to heat his impatience into fever. Still, though perhaps rather from the promptings of his eldest daughter than the instigations of his own heart, he took some pains to assure himself of the favourable condition of the young man who had been wounded in succouring him; and did not resolve upon his journey, or, at least, did not commence his visible preparations for it, until he learned from the sober report of Badger, and the no less credible, but less solemn statements of Rawlins, that Vernon's hurts were not such as could detain him more than a day in his chamber. This ascertained, he bade adieu to Zion's Hill and his friendly entertainers, and by the time the sun had fairly purpled the green tops of the forest, he was speeding fast along the by-road which conducted to Badger's, and which he had taken the night before with so much unwillingness, and so little grace. It was some hours after his departure, before Vernon awakened from the deep sleep into which he had been thrown by the opiate which had been given him the night before. Nor could he be said to have awakened to perfect consciousness, because he awakened to the light. The stupifying effect of the laudanum benumbed his energies, and seemed to confuse his faculties of thought and observation. A sort of dreamy consciousness of what had taken place, in which all things floated incoherently and indistinctly before his mental vision, disturbed the certainty of his conceptions; and it was only by the aid of Rawlins, who sat beside his couch when his eyes opened, that he recovered the knowledge of the events which had taken place the afternoon before. The stiffness of his wounded limb, and a trembling and slightly sore sensation about the spots which were hurt, confirmed so much of the particulars as related to his own interest in the conflict; and, gradually he was reminded of other circumstances, which it seemed to him no less important that he should know. He had an indistinct recollection of a bright vision of beauty which had hung for a few moments above his eyes—a vision such as had been vouchsafed him more than once before, in a dream no less sweet and inspiriting, though scarcely so distinct as that which had been more recent. Then came the passing consciousness that had possessed him in the moment when he swooned away, of his having found the person of the escaping criminal whom he sought on the part of his benefactor. With this returning conviction, his faculties grew more assured and industrious, and, cautiously concealing his great interest in the issue of his inquiry, he proceeded to examine his companion on the subject of the party rescued. This examination tended somewhat to confirm the impression which he had received the evening before, that William Maitland actually stood before him, in the person of the man whom he had rescued; the description of his person, as given him by Rawlins, strengthened this belief. The mere difference of name was a small and trivial obstacle, and one readily overcome by a reference to the ease with which a name might be changed, where the party was unknown; and the obvious policy of one flying from justice, to effect this change in order to avoid detection. The greater objection to his conviction lay in the two daughters, by whom Wilson was accompanied. The elder was already a woman grown,—the other, nearly in her teens, and the description of Carter had led him to expect mere children in the daughters of Maitland. This difficulty, upon reflection, seemed, to the sanguine mind of Vernon, scarcely less trivial than that of the name. Carter spoke of the children as he had known them, and probably with some reference to his own greater age; and as Vernon threw back his thoughts to the period when Maitland practised his treachery upon his friend, and married Ellen Taylor, the probabilities gained strength, as he found that, allowing them to have had children within a reasonable space of time after marriage, those children might very well be sixteen or seventeen, the apparent age of the eldest daughter of the traveller. But if this conclusion gave him pleasure in one respect, as it satisfied him that the means of retrieving the fortunes and the credit of his patron were almost in his grasp, he, singularly enough, felt some reluctance to pursue them, when he thought of the misery and disgrace which exposure of the father would bring upon the lovely woman, his daughter, whose first glance had so impressed itself upon his fancy. The matter would have seemed easy enough to provide for the children, as such, who, at the tender years of childhood, could not well have been conscious of the shame which would necessarily follow the detection of the father. But the case became wonderfully different and difficult when the child was a woman— and such a woman,—having, without doubt, sensibilities keen and quickening, such as are proper to her sex; and a consciousness of shame corresponding with that intelligence, which, without any other knowledge than lay in his own endowing fancy, he assumed, must belong to such lovely and speaking features, as those which looked down upon him in his moments of lapsing consciousness. How could he pursue, without relenting, the father of such a woman? how could he, as the stern minister of justice—in fact, the sheriff's agent, with a special power to place fetters upon his limbs—how could he drag that old man, felon though he was, from the presence of that daughter? He felt that she would rise between him and his victim—the rebuking, the imploring, the preserving angel;—that her tears would be his reproach; her sorrows, his sentence of condemnation; and he felt, even then, that her hate to the oppressor of her father, would be a something beyond his best ability to bear. But when, on the other hand, he thought of Carter—his patron, his only father,—the sterner commands of duty—the earnest voice of soliciting gratitude—spoke another language to his better judgment. “I must do my duty,” he murmured to himself as he strove feebly to rise from the couch; “it must be done. Rawlins, my good fellow, help me to put myself in trim, for I feel very stiff and stupid. I must get up: I must see this gentleman.” “What gentleman?” said Rawlins. “Mr. Wilson; the gentleman we helped yesterday. Did you not tell me that he came with us— that he brought me here?” “Ay, but he cleared out by sunrise this morning. He was in a monstrous hurry to be off, and would have gone before daylight, if 'twasn't for that angel creature, his daughter. She told him mighty plain that 'twouldn't do for them to go till they know'd that you were safe.” “Ha! Did she say that?” “I heard her with my own ears, though she didn't know I was nigh. I was coming in at the entry door leading to the shed, and her back was to me all the time. She said a good deal more which I couldn't make out, but I understood enough to see that she was blaming him for his hard-hearted way of making thanks for the help he got from us—not to speak of my help in the business, for it was mostly yours. Yet she didn't leave me out, she spoke to me herself about it, and told me how her father owed every thing to us, and how I must tell you this when you got better. Well, they waited, as she said they must, till Billy Badger felt your pulse, and looked at your face—and he looked long enough, and felt long enough to have answered for all the sick men in Massissippi. When he told them that you'd do well enough without any more doctoring, I never saw a girl more relieved. She didn't say any thing then, but tied the bonnet on her sister, and went jist as the old gentleman told her; but I saw a big drop in her eyes as she was going, and her last words were to me, remembering me to tell you what she said, and how sorry she was that her father's business made him hurry away, so that he couldn't say for himself how much they thanked you. She's a most notable fine girl, I'm thinking, as ever I looked upon.” Vernon derived a greater degree of gratification from this detail of his companion, than the long, rambling sentences of Rawlins were usually apt to afford him. But though he lingered over the narrative with a silent pleasure, he did not forego his purpose of rising from his couch of inactivity, and of pursuing the task which he had too deliberately and resolutely undertaken to forego without shame. The rapid haste of Wilson tended to confirm him in the belief that it was Maitland that he pursued; and when he recollected the liberal and large extent of the commission which had been entrusted to his hands, the discretion which it empowered him to exercise in the case of the absconding criminal, and the ease with which, under its indulgent privileges, he might obtain his object without any public exposure of the victim—nay, even without a revelation of the crime to the innocent daughter of the criminal,—he found himself strengthened for the duty, and eager once more for its resumption. But he rose with some increase of pain. The limb which, in his quiescent state, was tolerably easy, now throbbed painfully with the weight and pressure of his frame upon it, and having, with the assistance of his friend Rawlins, reached the hall where the family was assembled, he found himself compelled to appropriate the calico-covered sofa to its whole extent, in the hope to regain that position of quiet, which he had found before in his couch. In this effort, and while enjoying the returning ease which it brought him, he was no doubt greatly strengthened and assisted by the consoling review of his situation, and the circumstances attending it, which his ghostly landlord, in his own measured manner, presented to his mind. According to this venerable elder, his hurt was a subject of self-congratulation, which should not be suffered to escape his own commentary. He was one of those, who, regarding evils as masked benefits, looked upon Vernon as particularly fortunate in the favour of Providence, and rated the extent of his good by the degree of dissatisfaction and impatience which the victim displayed beneath it. Having exhausted all the proverbial forms of biblical and mere moral expression on the subject, he proceeded to a display of his own experience; and, if his judgment might have been regarded as equally valuable with his faith, it would have appeared convincing enough to his hearers, that he had never yet suffered an affliction which had not in its ultimate consequences been a real blessing, infinitely beyond any other, which, in its absence, might have fallen to his lot. His voluminous history, fortunately for Vernon, had its own interest, apart from the savoury Christian deductions which the narrator never failed to make from all its leading details; and if the youth was not greatly enlightened and strengthened in moral respects by what he heard, he was certainly edified, amused, and sometimes excited, by adventures on “field and flood,” in forest and prairie, in which, like one half of the settlers of Mississippi, William Badger had proved the possession of a manly soul and strength, contending with savage beasts and forests, and not unfrequently with more savage men. But for these details, which gave action and vitality to the old man's prosing, Vernon might have made his retreat in utter desperation; but he bore it with becoming fortitude, until relieved by more exciting details, which put a stop to those of the Methodist, and sent all parties to new subjects of cogitation and remark. The dinner hour had arrived, and the family had already taken their places around the table; Rachel presiding, opposite to the uncle; on one hand, Rawlins, on the other, Gideon Badger, as demure, while VOL. I. 24 in the presence of the father, as the most worthy of the congregation. Vernon was indulged with a small table beside the sofa on which he lay, upon which was placed some thin soup and a few well-boiled fragments of chicken, such being thought the least hurtful diet for an invalid. William Badger had already commenced that interminable grace before meat, which Rawlins, after the fashion of his own wit, had styled “the dinner cooler,” when a bustle was heard at the door, as of one about to enter, and the tones of a voice which Rawlins immediately recognised as that of Edward Mabry, the youth, whose fight with, and pursuit of, young Horsey, has already been recorded. “It's Edward Mabry,” said Rawlins, looking up from his plate as he perceived from the pause which William Badger made in his grace that the interruption had reached his ears. But, as if resolved that no intrusion ought to put a stop to the wholesome preliminary service in which he was engaged, with a devotedness which most persons of good appetite would have preferred paying to the dinner itself, he resumed his prayer just where it had been arrested: “—Thy divine countenance, oh Lord Jesus Christ, and sanctify to us the food which is now before us—” and so he proceeded to the end without farther notice of the events going on around him, though, in the meanwhile, Edward Mabry, with more haste than was consistent, either with the solemn visage, rigid habits, or grave ceremony of the host, rushed into the apartment. His audacity did not venture to go farther when he found in what manner the venerable elder was engaged; and standing apart, with hat in hand, he waited, breathless and impatient, until the grace, which seemed to expand even beyond its ordinary limits, was brought to the conclusion. The “amen” was scarcely uttered before the torrent burst its barriers. “Mr. Badger, Mr. Badger,” said the young man, “I come for a warrant—take up a villain—enough to hang him—shall do it. Must grant a warrant, and send Harvey out this very evening. Only sorry I didn't come to you before. But it's not too late— never too late to hang a rascal, and a warrant this evening will answer—a warrant to Harvey. I'm ready to swear ag'in him any moment.” “A warrant, Ned!” exclaimed Rawlins. “A warrant!” echoed Gideon Badger, with rather more nervousness than the occasion seemed to call for; and even the usually composed maiden, Rachel Morrison, could not forbear the like exclamation. “A warrant!” “Ay, a warrant!—a warrant against John Yarbers, Mr. Badger,—he's a villain, a thief,—he's the man that helped to run Jo Watson's horse, and I can prove that he put him in the hands of Bill Munson, the fellow that got off last month from deputy Nichols. I'm ready to take my affidavy to it.” The methodical lips of William Badger at length parted. His face put on new terrors, his words were stern, and the tone threatening. “Young man,” he said, regarding the disfigured visage of the intruder rather than the tale which he told, “young man, you have been fighting.” The youth muttered some hasty words, in which “honour,”—“insolent fellow,”—“had to fight,” were strangely jumbled up with other less significant syllables, but the ascetic elder cut short the worthless pretext in a fashion of his own. “Edward Mabry, have I not repeatedly counselled you against this brutal and blackguard practice? Have I not repeatedly told you that I care not to see you in my dwelling so long as you cannot forbear the rending and gouging of your neighbours?” “I come about business, Mr. Badger,” said the other, sulkily, “I come about business; I come to you as a justice, I don't come as a visiter.” “And I speak to you as a justice; and had I caught you, sir, in the brutal act, I should, as a justice, have had you taken and punished; though, to be sure, you seem to have had something more than your usual share of punishment already. God has seen fit to send you a foe who could imprint on you those marks which you are but too apt to put upon the faces of others; upon faces, Edward Mabry, made after God's own blessed image. It is his image that you tear, and bruise, and gouge, with a most miserable propensity to sin. But sit you down —why stand you in waiting when the meat is sanctified and ready? Sit you down and partake with us, young man, though it grieves and sickens me to behold you in this condition. Rachel, set a plate.” “I'm not hungry,” replied the youth, with no abatement of his sullenness, for the reference which Badger had made to the superiority of his enemy had irritated an old sore—“I'm not hungry, I thank God, Mr. Badger, since if I was, I could not sit down at a man's table when he don't wish to see me in his house.” “There is hope of you,” was the cool reply of the Methodist, “so long as you have the grace to thank God for any thing. Sit you down, I say, whether hungry or not, and wait on those who are. As a magistrate, I will hear your statement, and take your oath if need be, when we have dined; but I warn you, Edward Mabry, that an oath is a serious and solemn invocation; the Lord is spiritually present when it is taken; it is an awful, and soul-binding, and soul-responsible assurance. Beware, then, that you swear not against your neighbour, unless with a perfect certainty, so far as the blindness of human sense and judgment may admit of certainty, that what you say is the truth. But sit you down and eat. Gideon Badger, help Edward Mabry to some of the chicken which is before you. Eat, Walter Rawlins.—And so, Edward Mabry, you are certain that it was Yarbers who run the horse?” “Caught him a-doing it, sir. But that aint all; there's another business more serious. I have a strong notion I can prove he's been talking insurrection stuff among the niggers.” “That is a dreadful crime, Edward Mabry, and I could wish that you spoke not such suspicions aloud, until you have strong proof of their truth. If I remember rightly, it is now near a month since Joseph Watson recovered the horse which had been stolen.” “Yes, sir, about a month.” “Ah! and you knew the fact at the time. You knew when the robbery was committed.” “'Twas I caught Yarbers with the animal, making tracks for Vicksburg.” “And wherefore have you kept this thing hidden so long, Edward Mabry? Why have you foreborne to bring this evildoer to punishment before this? And why is it, that, having suppressed the truth so long, you now declare it in the unbecoming language of human passion? Answer me these questions, Edward Mabry, for something of my conduct will depend upon the explanation which you may now give of yours.” These were home questions, and the effort to answer them only involved the speaker in all the meshes of a seemingly inextricable confusion. It was only by piecemeal, and after the most Socratic 24* examination, that the keen, searching, old Methodist obtained all the facts, and came to the conclusion, that, but for a quarrel between the parties, the horse-stealing, and other offences of John Yarbers, might have been buried in utter oblivion, so far as the testimony of Edward Mabry was concerned. In brief, the party was soon apprised that Mabry, whose attachment to Mary Stinson was, like most attachments of country lovers, known to all the neighbourhood, had, after fruitlessly pursuing the actor to the river without overtaking him, returned with a double feeling of wrath and mortification to his own home. From thence he had gone, early the next morning, to the house of Yarbers, and there had pressed his claim, in the absence of the latter, to the hand of his daughter-in-law. He had done this quite as much in anger as in love, being resolved to bring the matter to a close, as he found himself unable to bear the continual anxiety and passionate strifes to which his position exposed him: and he did not, in fact, believe that he was entirely wanting in attraction to the eyes of the damsel. But he made his application at the worst possible moment. The calculating mother and uncalculating daughter had but too recently parted with the gay and attractive actor, and he met with a flat rejection from both, the terms of which, on the part of Mrs. Yarbers, were uttered in a manner no ways complimentary to the pride and vanity of the suitor. Burning with indignation, he rushed from the house, only to encounter John Yarbers at the entrance. To him he breathed, without stint or limit, the indignation which he felt; and his rage was complete when the husband simply and civilly confessed that he had no power to alter the decision of his wife. Yarbers was rather nonchalant in his treatment of Mabry, for he had just before had the assurance of the master-spirit, Saxon, that the thing should be settled in such a manner as to save him harmless; but he begged Mabry to wait awhile longer, and concluded —having a reference to some crude and half-digested plan of Saxon—by recommending that Mabry should contrive to get himself made colonel; a vacancy then existing in the regiment by the death of the late celebrated Colonel Quillinan. To the raging Mabry, this seemed little less than downright mockery; and without farther exchange of words, he put spurs to his horse, and took the road to the house of the justice of Zion's Hill. The progress of the visiter in this quarter, has so far been narrated. Taking the magistrate apart, Walter Rawlins ventured to excuse Mabry's suppression of the facts so long, by taking upon himself a portion of the blame. “As the thing's out, now, Mr. Badger, though to my thinking it had been better in for a while longer, even though John Yarbers got quite off, why, I may as well up and tell you, sir, that I advised Ned Mabry to keep the matter quiet.” “And, pray, what may have been your reasons, Walter Rawlins, for thus seeking to screen the criminal from the hands of justice?” “Only that the hands of justice might get a good gripe when she tried for it,” was the prompt reply of the woodman. Then, proceeding with some rapidity, as he saw that his farther treatment of the figure was regarded with a grave countenance by the Methodist, he went on to give certain reasons and facts for the policy which he had pursued. “You must know, Mr. Badger, that there are more persons than John Yarbers concerned in this trade of horse-stealing, and it isn't the one mare of Joe Watson that's been cleared out by 'em in my time. We happen to know of many horses that's been lost to their owners, that John Yarbers found a claim in; and we sort o' concluded—me, and Tom Coleman, Jack Andrews, and Ned Mabry, here— that, as we knew all that any did know, and as that wasn't enough to clinch any but John Yarbers, that we'd say nothing for a while, and only keep a sharp look out and be in readiness to find out the rest. We all considered Yarbers to be a poor shoat, that only did as others told him. We had suspicions of three other men that took the horses after Yarbers had run 'em to the river, and carried 'em on from hand to hand, till they got 'em where they could sell 'em without danger of being known; and we thought by keeping quiet about Yarbers, and watching him close, that we might get on a trail that would lead us to the other rascals. Yarbers don't dream to this day that any body but Ned Mabry knows about his rascality. Ned caught him with the horse hobbled; and his liking for Yarbers' wife's daughter made him very willing to say nothing, till now, about the dad. He told me only because we were so friendly, and he knew I could keep a close mouth over any secret.” “You have done wrong; you should have brought this man to justice. The law is the terror to evil-doers, and they should be made to feel it. And who, Walter Rawlins, are the men of whom you have suspicions?” “Well, Squire, I can't tell you that, seeing that I've made a promise not to do so until there's a good chance to clinch 'em, and we get good witnesses. I'm sort of dubious it'll be a mighty tough business whenever the time comes.” “And what, Walter Rawlins, may be the reason of this fear?” said the magistrate, with increasing severity of tone and solemnity of look, his self-esteem being grievously disturbed by the refusal of the woodman to confide in him the extent of his knowledge. “Because, Squire, we've good reasons for thinking these rascals are backed by a great number that pass for honest men and good Christians; and up to this time, Squire, we're at a loss to say which is which among our acquaintance and those that put on religion, and talk very good things at meeting. Every now and then there's a robbery, now on this, and now on the other side of the Big Black, but at all times too mighty nigh us not to make it very strange of the sort of folks that live about. There was Dick Coby robbed of his watch and all he had, coming from Benton a week ago, by two men in disguise; and there was the beating that Harvey got up by Doak's stand, about the same time, by other men in disguise, while he was on his way to sarve your warrant; then, again, this attack on the old gentleman, Mr. Wilson, here, as I may say, in sight of Zion's Hill;—why, Squire, you can't shut your eyes to the thing. It's clear as noonday that there's a gang of rascals that stand by each other, and aint afraid of the worst that can be done to them. Besides, I'm somehow thinking, Squire, that there's nothing you can do, or any magistrate, that they won't get wind of, in a mighty short time after they do it.” Rawlins did not confine himself to this brief array of circumstances to establish the probability of the faith that was in him. He proceeded to the detail of other events, some of which were known to the magistrate and others new; but the accumulation of facts had the effect of convincing and startling the Methodist, when, one by one, as they occurred, they would have made little impression, and that of little duration, upon his mind. “Verily, Walter Rawlins, thou hast shown me these things in stronger lights than they have come to me before. It is a shame and a discredit to me, as a magistrate under the appointment of man, and no less as a humble follower of Christ Jesus, that these things should be suffered to go on around me. It were well to get the young men together, and bestir ourselves in the examination of this swamp which is beside us; for that, according to my thought no less than thine, must be the place in which these villains harbour. How many young men canst thou muster at blowing of the horn?” “Well, Squire, I reckon there may be ten or thereabouts,” returned the woodman, muttering their names over to himself, and counting upon his fingers as he spoke. “Ten!—ten only! Why, Walter, either I lose my arithmetic, or you have never yet found yours. By what rule can you count? Instead of ten, there may be twenty, nay, thirty, mustered by the horn blowing.” “Yes, Squire, but it aint by horn blowing that I would bring together the men for such a business as this. Some of the men that would come at horn blowing would be more likely to help the rascals than to hurt them; and if I could tell you some of the suspicionable names that I know on, you'd look green again.” “I cannot say, Walter Rawlins, that I altogether understand you when you speak of my looking green again; but, at all events, I will look farther and immediately into this business. I will confer with this young man, Vernon, who speaks sensibly on most subjects, and he hath shown himself bold enough to be a leader in any strife that may follow, and is surely not to be suspected of any connexion with these outlaws of whom you speak. If he will go forth with us, it were something; for thou and thy ten men would go but a little way to compass all the points of the swamp, and beleaguer those who harbour therein. The canebrake were, alone, a sufficient protection. But let us seek these other youths. We have already five in this dwelling, counting myself and Gideon Badger with the rest, and I trust in God that when the hour of evil strife shall come, there will be fifty rather than ten willing to gather together for the good of the covenant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. “We are not grown so proud As to disdain familiar conference.” Massinger. Rawlins was not altogether satisfied that the Methodist should take the business so completely out of his hands, but he well knew that there was no hope of successful resistance against the usurpation. The self-esteem of William Badger was well sustained by the firm rigidity of his character, and the perfect unconsciousness of any thing like presumption in the lead which he was resolved to take. The woodman shrugged his shoulders, therefore, and said nothing; congratulating himself that he had kept the suspected names to himself, and inly determining to continue his own plans, which, though less dignified and imposing than those of the senior, yet promised to be, for that very reason, far more effective. He followed the squire into the salle a manger, where the young men had been left, and where he found them busily engaged in the discussion of sundry subjects, all of which were necessarily made to give way to that which was always the most important to William Badger,—that, namely, which most interested himself. The latter proceeded, as if from his own knowledge and thought,—for he made no sort of reference to Rawlins in the progress of his narrative —to give the substance of what he had heard, to describe the evil condition of the neighbourhood, and to expatiate upon the necessity of gathering the young men together for the purpose of routing the evil-doers. Vernon heard him with a degree of pleasure and interest which he found it not so easy to suppress; but he regarded the young Badger with eyes of too much keenness and suspicion to suffer his real sentiments to be known. Without hesitation, he joined issue with the venerable elder, as well on the propriety as the necessity of the course he proposed to pursue; deliberately questioning the correctness of the assumption, that there was any number of men engaged in the outlawry which had troubled the neighbourhood; and insisting upon the strong probability of all the detailed offences having been committed by the same two or three individuals who had been conspicuous in each. Much of his argument was founded upon the broad, patriotic text, that in a country like ours, where the means of life are so readily and universally to be obtained, it was morally impossible that any numerous set of men could be found, wilfully disregarding the laws, and making themselves liable to their penalties. His views were supported at large, and with much more earnestness, by Gideon Badger, who took especial care to wind up his notions of the subject, by an elaborate eulogy upon the moral and religious influences which had been exercised over the neighbourhood by the burning and shining light fixed upon Zion's Hill. But neither the well-tempered courtesy with which Vernon had spoken, nor the closing and rather bald flattery of Gideon's speech, saved them from the charge of vaingloriousness and presumption from the venerable elder, who was never more full of Christian texts than when he was following his own mind, and VOL. I. 25 resolved upon making others do so likewise. Having adopted the notions of Rawlins as his own, he was as rigid in their maintenance as he ever could have been in that of a favourite text. He went into a history of all the robberies and murders in the county and in the neighbouring counties for the ten previous years; connected them together by a supposititious train of circumstances, ascribed them all to the same set of men, and concluded by declaring, that “the time was at length come for the punishment of the offenders; that the vengeance of God was at length ripe; that the sword was unsheathed to smite, and sharpened for destruction, and that he”—though this was rather left to the implication of the hearers—“was the appointed messenger of wrath, who was at once to denounce the judgment and carry it into execution.” His resolution to obey the commission which had been given him, was followed by a direct demand of Vernon's services, to assist in carrying out his purposes, which he resolved to begin forthwith. “Impossible, Mr. Badger, impossible!” was the reply of Vernon. “I am not the master of my own time, and can delay no longer than is absolutely necessary. I must pursue my journey to-morrow, and should have resumed it to-day, but that my thigh felt too sore and stiff to justify the attempt to ride so soon after my hurts.” “Young man, would you fly from your duty?” demanded the other with solemnity. “No, sir, it is in the performance of my duties that I would fly so soon from your hospitable dwelling. I have occasions which command my haste and attention elsewhere; and I propose to leave you, at the rise of to-morrow's dawn, with the view to their performance.” The elder was not to be gainsayed, and he showed himself as tenacious on the present, as upon most other occasions. “There can be no call so urgent, young man, as that of our country; no duty so clearly necessary as the detection and punishment of crime.” “You forget, Mr. Badger,” replied Vernon, availing himself of his own expressed opinions rather than those which he really felt; “you forget, Mr. Badger, that I take a different view of these facts from yourself; that I see not the same dangers, and do not recognise the same necessity; but, even were it otherwise, I see not how I could assist you materially, and acknowledge the presence of other, and as you may think them, selfish obligations, which compel me elsewhere. Should it occur that I may do any thing to promote your wishes, I believe I may safely assure you that you should not find me wanting.” “We must even try to carry on the good work without you,” replied the other stiffly; and with this the farther conference between the two ended. But the reluctance of Vernon rather stimulated than discouraged the Methodist, who was always strengthened in purpose and performance by the increase of his own personal responsibilities. Having despatched a servant to summon his constable, Harvey, to his presence, he proceeded to concoct his plans for taking the outlaws, or, at least, breaking up their nest in the Loosa-Chitta swamp, with more earnestness than secrecy. The arrival of Harvey enabled him to issue the warrant against Yarbers for horse-stealing, based upon the oath of Edward Mabry. “This knocks up your affair with Mary Stinson for ever, Ned,” was the consolatory remark whispered in the ears of the lover by his friend Rawlins, as the warrant was given to the constable. “Well, I know it—I don't care a d—; I'll make him sweat for his impudence, though it makes me lose every thing.” Harvey, who was a stout fellow, of a bold heart and well-tried honesty, was made a party to the farther deliberations on the subject of the outlaws of the neighbourhood, and so much time was consumed in the discussion of projects and difficulties, that night came on ere he was permitted to depart for the purpose of arresting Yarbers. This duty was therefore deferred to the ensuing morning; but that very night, a trusty messenger conveyed the tidings of his danger to the horse thief, who left a warm nest, but nothing in it, to reward the industry of the constable, who returned to the magistrate with another proof to the many commented on by Rawlins, that there was some secret and sinister influence continually busy to find out his designs, and defeat his warrants. Yarbers, who was neither worse nor better than a squatter, before daylight the next morning, was speeding on with bag and baggage, wife and daughter, to a place of hiding well known to all the beagles in the swamp. But Vernon, though he refrained from yielding himself to the importunities of Badger, had no such indifference to his project, nor did he entertain those doubts of the necessity of proceeding against the outlaws which he yet professed. In his chamber that night, alone with Rawlins, he declared himself more fully. “I agree with you, Rawlins, in my doubts of the integrity of this youth, Gideon Badger, and I have as little faith in the judgment of his father. The one would wilfully and dishonestly betray,—the other would commit the same fault through the mere love of display and authority. I am pleased at the reserve which you have shown, and will requite it by a degree of confidence which must move you to increased reserve. What I do and say to you, must, of all things, be most studiously kept from this old man and his son; and, indeed, whatever you propose to do in the case of these robbers, must be also withheld, if you hope to be successful in your projects. Your passionate friend, Mabry, too, should have none of your confidence in such matters, for, though honest enough, he lacks all discretion, and would blow us in the first gust of phrensy that happened to seize upon him. See to that door—I heard footsteps—I speak for your ears only.” This done, and assured that there was none to hear but Rawlins, Vernon proceeded to inform the astounded woodman of those facts in the history of the mystic brotherhood, and the flight of Clem Foster from Alabama, and his probable presence in the neighbourhood, all of which had been gathered by him in his interview with the Governor of Mississippi. We forbear the long detail, so unnecessary to us, and avoid repetition of the still longer conversation which ensued between the two in reference to the subject, and the proper course to be pursued by Rawlins in the management of the game before him. Vernon studiously counselled the other to forbear taking any active part in the affair, until events had more completely developed the persons, the aims, and the particular whereabouts of the outlaws. In all circumstances he especially counselled the sturdy woodman—who already regarded him as an oracle,—while using the influence of William Badger, on no account to admit his privity to any plan which he might deem it advisable to pursue. “It may be that I shall be able to assist you in person before many days. My present hope is to accomplish the urgent business upon which I shall set forth to-morrow, in time to fulfil the partial promise which I made, on leaving Raymond, to the Governor. But, at all events, I will provide you with authority for your own action, which will 25* strengthen your power, and confirm your influence over your neighbours. Here is a commission, with his Excellency's signature, which makes you a captain over such a body of men as you may gather together willing to obey your command. Here, farther, is a small list of suspected persons. To none of these should you extend your trust. Some of the persons, perhaps, may be among your acquaintance, and it would be advisable, however well you may esteem them, to maintain towards them the utmost reserve respecting all your plans. I will write to his Excellency to-night, under an assumed name, and leave the letter with you, to despatch from the nearest post-office. The address will be one already agreed upon between us, and he will give you farther instructions—perhaps send to you a special messenger—as George Jenkinson. You will answer to the name for a time, since it would be unsafe to address you by your own. I will also give you another letter to a friend, which you will oblige me by despatching by the same post as that which takes my letter to the Governor. There are other matters upon which I will reflect before sleeping to-night, which will, perhaps, enable us to correspond while apart, and play this difficult game with some good prospects of success. For the present, let us separate, that there may be no suspicions of the confidence between us.” That night Vernon prepared his letters for the Governor, and his friend and patron, Carter. To the former he detailed such a portion of his adventures, and his brief experience at Zion's Hill, as would enable him to form an idea of the material he had to depend upon in the issue which, it was obvious enough, was approaching fast between the outlaws and the government. The merits of Walter Rawlins were set forth in proper language, and a list of names, which had been furnished by the worthy woodman, of persons to be relied on, was included in the letter. To Carter he wrote a more comprehensive epistle, in which his fortunes from the moment of their separation, were described at large. He did not fail to apprise him of the discovery, which he thought himself to have made, of Maitland in the person of the traveller whom he had rescued from the robbers. His hurt, slight as it was, was spoken of even more slightingly than it deserved; and he declared his ability and intention to renew his pursuit on the morning following. His language was full of hope and light-heartedness, his tone being studiously assumed to encourage his friend and patron. But it might have been remarked that though Vernon spoke freely and fully of all other matters, he yet found, on finishing the letter, that he had said not a word on the subject of the two daughters—or, rather, the one daughter of Maitland—who accompanied him. He was reminded, on re-perusing the epistle, to say something to supply this omission in the form of a postscript, but finding that he had not room to say much, he adopted the satisfactory determination to say nothing; and so his labours closed for the night. While the conference was going on between Vernon and Rawlins, Gideon Badger was making his way to the woods, where he found Saxon, Jones, and another of the confederates. To them he narrated the discussion which had taken place, under his father's lead, between the assembled company at Zion's Hill. “This fellow, Mabry,” said Saxon, “will not sleep soundly until he's knocked on the head. We must send Yarbers off, for it won't do to kick up a bobbery on his account. Mack,” he continued, addressing the confederate hitherto unnamed, “take horse instantly for Yarbers—tell him what's going on, and say from me, that we can do nothing for him just now. Let him make tracks for Bear Garden before day peeps.” To hear was to obey. The fellow was off in the twinkling of an eye, and Saxon continued thus: “What the devil shall we do to quiet your father, Gideon? I am puzzled what to do with him.” “Knock him on the head, too,” was the answer of Jones, “if it's only to help Gideon to a little that he ought to have, and rescue him from the straight jacket of Methodism. Lord! Saxon, it's the most funny thing in the world, to see the pompous old parson, his round, red face looking forth from his white neckcloth, and half fenced in by his high shoulders and black cape, like a terrapin on a wet log, meditating the ways and means for a Sunday dinner, and Gideon, meek as a mouse in the corner of a trap that has baffled all his efforts at escape, patiently resigned to what is coming—an evening prayer and sermon three hours long, church measure—cursing in his heart, all the while, that sort of heavenly unction which keeps him in a stew worse than any ever known in hell. I have peeped in once when I went to look after Gideon, and once was enough. After that I never went nigher than the garden fence, and there I gave the signal. That sermon was quite enough to keep off any beagle of any taste, and sure am I, that the old man had better begin to hunt us with a full mouth, such as he had that day, than with a six pounder. We could dodge the shot, but that sermon would be sure to reach us wherever we might skulk. For my part, let me be safe hidden in a hollow, and put Billy Badger near by, well wound up for a long run, he'd be sure to drive me out. I must stop my ears, or let my heels go, for stand him ten minutes I neither could nor would, for all that head or heels might be worth. I'm clear, the shortest and best way for all parties is to knock him on the head with Mabry. We have good reason for thinking that Gideon would never take up preaching as a trade, certainly he cannot give us such prayers as his father; and so the sooner the old man is gathered, the better for the goodly seed which he leaves behind him.” Gideon, who was one of those goodly rogues that like to keep up appearances even in situations where hypocrisy seems to be the last thing necessary, growled out something in reply to this, of an angry savour; but Jones knew his man and answered: “Tut, tut, Gideon, you waste breath. You know as well as I, that were the Lord in his mercy—to use the goodly phraseology of Zion's Hill—to summon to his keeping the blessed head thereof, it would be a call more grateful to his devout and affectionate son Gideon, than any his ears ever heard.” “Enough, Jones,” said the more considerate Saxon, “this talk, which Gideon may suppose you to utter earnestly, brings us no nigher to our object. Of course we should never think of doing hurt or harm to any of the family of one who belongs to, and acts with us, unless it became absolutely necessary to his and to our interests. The only course which seems clear to me, if the old man gets up his squad, which he will find it hard work to do, is that we must skulk and run for it. That he can neither find nor trouble us, is sufficiently certain. Gideon, alone, as one of his band, will give us all intelligence; and there is Cotton, Saunders, Furst, Mason, Wilkes, and others, whom he will no doubt muster with him, and who will tell us just when and where the cat will jump, so that we may leave the nest empty. We must leave you, Jones, to receive notice from Gideon, whom you can see nightly, of any thing that may be determined on, and this intelligence you must send by the quickest beagle you can call up, so that we may know at Cane Castle and Bear Garden what to look for and when. What you tell me of this young fellow, Vernon, is the most surprising of all. Can it be that I am mistaken in the man? Is it possible that he is only going for private business? But what business? It may be the location of Yazoo lands; he may be another of the mad fools who dream nothing but pre-emptions, and fancy they are playing the great game to themselves, while all the rest of the world is gaping and looking on. You say you searched his baggage and found no papers?” “None. I emptied his portmanteau while he slept on the sofa in the hall, and found nothing but a few changes of linen, a vest, some handkerchiefs, and half a dozen stockings. There was neither letter nor writing.” “Did you open the stockings?” “No! I didn't think of that.” “Ah! that was half doing the business only. But you say that he not only objected to going with your father, but doubted the truth of his conjectures.” “Made light of it—nay, laughed at it; and concluded by declaring his intention to resume his own journey upward by to-morrow's sun.” “I must meet with him. I must look into him myself,” said Saxon. “I will join him on the road, to-morrow, and he will be a keen lawyer, indeed, if I do not probe his depth, and find out his secrets. It may be that I am deceived, yet the circumstances are all strong and strange. He may have laughed at the Governor's fears as he laughed at Badger's; and yet, after all, it may have been a private speculation only. Would I could have heard that conversation; but regret is useless. We must make up in skill the deficiencies of fortune, and make ingenuity do that which necessity requires to be done. If I do not sound him thoroughly to-morrow we must call Justice Nawls to our assistance.” Much of this was spoken soliloquizingly; and was, possibly, beyond the immediate comprehension of his comrades. At its close, Gideon Badger asked— “Did you suffer the old man, Wilson, to get off?” “Yes:—your blundering the day before, and the death of Weston, persuaded me that it was proper for us to do so, at least in this neighbourhood. I set a hound on his track, however, so that we may know where he earths, and what course he takes. If he has any thing, we can easily cover him before he touches the Tennessee line. But enough with you to-night, Gideon. A dog will bark at the foot of the garden at noon to-morrow—let him know what the old man has done, or is about to do. Good night.” The confederates separated; Saxon and his companion, Jones, sinking into the deep woods beyond the garden, and Gideon Badger, leaping the fence, and taking a shorter way to the house. They had fully gone from sight and hearing—ten minutes had been allowed to elapse after their absence—when Rachel Morrison emerged from the cowering attitude in which she had crouched and found concealment in a thick body of young plum saplings, brier and shrub shoots, that skirted the spot where the conspirators had carried on their conference, and in which she had heard every syllable that had been uttered. Her cheeks were pale, very pale, when she came forth from her place of concealment; her form trembled with the crowding and conflicting emotions of her soul; but her resolution, which had brought her to the spot, and had kept her firm, and above any of those apprehensions which afflict most women, was still as strong and unyielding as at first. Sick at heart, and sad, with a bitter sadness, she was yet glad that she had so far conquered her womanly fears—the scruples of a nice, and in ordinary necessities a proper delicacy—and had listened to that cold, calculating conference of villany, in which the fate of those to whom she was linked by innumerable ties, was so intimately interested. “It is, then, true, all true,” she exclaimed; “even as Mother Kerrison assured me, and as my own fears were most ready to believe. Gideon Badger is lost—lost for ever; and my poor old uncle—so proud in himself—so confident of all around him— with such hope in his only son—what will be the pang at his heart—what the crushing and humbling misery of his soul, when he shall hear of this? And hear of it he must. Even if my lips remain closed upon the subject, the truth will reach his ears at last. There must come the hour of discovery, when all will be known; and he—God strengthen and sustain him in that dreadful hour! For me, for me, what is left now? Shall I speak of what I have seen and heard? Shall my lips declare these dreadful tidings, and my hands offer him the bitter cup of desolation? No! no! I may not—I must not. I have not the strength—not the heart for this. I must contrive other means to prevent the utter ruin of the one, and the heart-wasting desolation of the other. God of Heaven—eternal and preserving Father, be with me this blessed night, and counsel me in the fitting course, which shall defeat the danger, and disarm the sting of this threatening sorrow. To thy grace and saving mercy, Lord Jesus, I commend myself, in this moment of doubt and difficulty.” Never was prayer more humble and devout, and offered with a more becoming sense and spirit, than that of Rachel Morrison, kneeling among the withered leaves, in the silence of the night, on the edge of that deep, dim, and mournfully sighing forest.
